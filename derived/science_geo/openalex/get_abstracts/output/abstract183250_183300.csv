https://openalex.org/W2129499959,"Type III pili deliver effector proteins (virulence factors) from bacterial pathogens to host cells. Plants express disease resistance (R) proteins that respond specifically to a particular type III effector by activating immune responses. We demonstrated previously that two unrelated type III effectors from Pseudomonas syringae target and modify the Arabidopsis RIN4 protein. Here, we show that AvrRpt2, a third, unrelated type III effector, also targets RIN4 and induces its posttranscriptional disappearance. This effect is independent of the presence of RPS2, the Arabidopsis R protein that senses AvrRpt2. RIN4 overexpression inhibits multiple phenotypes associated with AvrRpt2 function. Conversely, disruption of RIN4 results in RPS2-dependent lethality. RPS2 and RIN4 physically associate in the plant. We suggest that RIN4 is the target of the AvrRpt2 virulence function, and that perturbation of RIN4 activates RPS2. Thus, RIN4 is a point of convergence for the activity of at least three unrelated P. syringae type III effectors."
https://openalex.org/W1964061865,"Plants have evolved a sophisticated innate immune system to recognize invading pathogens and to induce a set of host defense mechanisms resulting in disease resistance. Pathogen recognition is often mediated by plant disease resistance (R) proteins that respond specifically to one or a few pathogen-derived molecules. This specificity has led to suggestions of a receptor-ligand mode of R protein function. Delivery of the bacterial effector protein AvrRpt2 by Pseudomonas syringae specifically induces disease resistance in Arabidopsis plants expressing the RPS2 R protein. We demonstrate that RPS2 physically interacts with Arabidopsis RIN4 and that AvrRpt2 causes the elimination of RIN4 during activation of the RPS2 pathway. AvrRpt2-mediated RIN4 elimination also occurs in the rps2, ndr1, and Atrar1 mutant backgrounds, demonstrating that this activity can be achieved independent of an RPS2-mediated signaling pathway. Therefore, we suggest that RPS2 initiates signaling based upon perception of RIN4 disappearance rather than direct recognition of AvrRpt2."

Here, we show that FMRP acts as a translational repressor of specific mRNAs at synapses. Interestingly, FMRP associates not only with these target mRNAs, but also with the dendritic, non-translatable RNA BC1. Blocking of BC1 inhibits the interaction of FMRP with its target mRNAs. Furthermore, BC1 binds directly to FMRP and can also associate, in the absence of any protein, with the mRNAs regulated by FMRP. This suggests a mechanism where BC1 could determine the specificity of FMRP function by linking the regulated mRNAs and FMRP. Thus, when FMRP is not present, loss of translational repression of specific mRNAs at synapses could result in synaptic dysfunction phenotype of Fragile X patients."

Dysregulation of protein ISG15 modification (ISGylation) in mice leads to decreased life expectancy, brain cell injury, and hypersensitivity to interferon. Although ISG15 was identified more than two decades ago, the exact biochemical and physiological functions of ISG15-modification remain unknown, and the proteins targeted by ISG15 have not been identified. The major purpose of this work was to identify ISG15 targets among well characterized proteins that could be used as models for biological studies. We purified ISGylated proteins from human thymus by immunoaffinity chromatography and analyzed ISG15 conjugates by a high-throughput Western blot screen (PowerBlotTM). We found that three key regulators of signal transduction, phospholipase Cγ1, Jak1, and ERK1 are modified by ISG15. In addition to that, we demonstrate that transcription factor Stat1, an immediate substrate of Jak1 kinase, is also ISGylated. Using whole cell protein extracts and phospholipase Cγ1 as an example we demonstrate that ISG15 conjugates are not accumulated in cells treated with specific inhibitors of proteasomes.

The sequence of ISG15 protein was noted to possess significant homology to a diubiquitin sequence, accounting for its cross-reactivity with some anti-ubiquitin antibodies (3Haas A.L. Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several reports demonstrate that ISG15 is released by various cell types and can act as a cytokine leading to proliferation of NK cells (5D'Cunha J. Knight Jr., E. Haas A.L. Truitt R.L. Borden E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that ISG15 is induced in the uterine endometrium during early pregnancy and was suggested to play a significant role in embryo implantation (6Hansen T.R. Austin K.J. Perry D.J. Pru J.K. Teixeira M.G. Johnson G.A. J. Reprod. Fertil. Suppl. 1999; 54: 329-339PubMed Google Scholar). ISG15 sequences are absent in yeast, nematode (Caenorhabditis), plant (Arabidopsis), and insect (Drosophila) indicating that the ISG15 conjugation system is restricted to higher animals with evolved IFN signaling. Most remarkably, ISG15 was found to be conjugated to intracellular proteins via an isopeptide bond in a manner similar to ubiquitin (Ub) and other Ub-like proteins (Ubls) such as SUMO and Nedd8 (7Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conjugation of Ubls involves a three-step mechanism whereby specific enzymes (or enzyme complexes) activate and covalently link Ubls to their substrates (8Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar, 9Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). ISG15 conjugation occurs via a similar but distinct pathway compared with Ub conjugation (10Narasimhan J. Potter J.L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and an activating enzyme for ISG15 has recently been rediscovered as specific to ISG15 and not Ub (11Yuan W. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Similar to modification by other Ubls, the conjugation of ISG15 is reversible and is accomplished by a highly specific protease UBP43 (12Malakhov M.P. Malakhova O.A. Kim K.I. Ritchie K.J. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9976-9981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology, UBP43 belongs to a family of Ub-specific proteases and was initially cloned in our laboratory from leukemogenic AML-ETO knock-in mice (13Liu L.Q. Ilaria Jr., R.

Schook L.B. Rutherford M.S. Virology. 1999; 262: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Li X.L. Blackford J.A. Judge C.S. Liu M. Xiao W. Kalvakolanu D.V. Hassel B.A. J. Biol.

Gene. 2001; 267: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). UBP43 is induced by IFN, LPS, and viral infection and, similarly to the ISG15 gene, is regulated via p38 MAPK pathway and IFN regulatory factor 3 (18Malakhova O. Malakhov M. Hetherington C. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14703-14711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). AUBP43−/− mouse model generated in our laboratory exhibits a massive accumulation of ISG15 conjugates in various tissues, which leads, either directly or indirectly, to decreased life expectancy, brain cell injury (19Ritchie K.J. Malakhov M.P. Hetherington C. Zhou L. Little M.T. Malakhova O.A. Sipe J. Zhang D.E. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2207-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and hypersensitivity to IFN stimulation (20Malakhova O. Yan M. Malakhov M.P. Yuan Y. Ritchie K.J. Kim K.I. Peterson L.F. Shuai K. Zhang D.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Although the role of Ub-, Nedd8-, and SUMO-modification has been assessed in numerous studies (8Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar, 21Hochstrasser M. Science. 2000; 289: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 22Jentsch S. Pyrowolakis G. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), the exact biochemical and physiological role of ISGylation has not been studied. A major reason for the undefined biochemical function of ISG15 conjugation is the lack of known ISG15 targets that may serve as experimental models. Only one target, serpin 2a, has recently been reported, but its exact function is not known (23Hamerman J.A. Hayashi F. Schroeder L.A. Gygi S.P. Haas A.L. Hampson L. Coughlin P. Aebersold R. Aderem A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2415-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this study we used a large-scale Western blot-based screening process to identify new targets of ISG15 modification from a group of well characterized signal transduction proteins. Here we report the first systematic attempt to establish the identity of ISGylated proteins. We show that several key regulators of signal transduction (namely, PLCγ1, Jak1, Stat1, and ERK1) are targeted by ISG15. Our data describes valid methodology for identification of new ISG15 targets, offers attractive models to study the function of ISGylation, and suggests a biological role for ISG15 modification in regulation of multiple signal transduction pathways. Hybridoma (clone 2.1) (24D'Cunha J. Ramanujam S. Wagner R.J. Witt P.L. Knight Jr., E. Borden E.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4100-4108PubMed Google Scholar) that produces monoclonal mouse anti-human ISG15 antibodies was cultured in Hybridoma-serum-free medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were removed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were filtered through a 0.22-ॖm filter to remove debris. IgGs were purified on a protein G column (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. Eluted IgGs were dialyzed against coupling buffer (0.2 mNa2HPO4, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 8.5). Six mg of purified IgGs were mixed with 1 ml of glyoxal-activated agarose (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) and NaBH3CN (Sigma) to a final concentration of 50 mm. Coupling proceeded overnight at 24 °C with constant rocking. Coupled resin was removed, and the supernatant was allowed to couple with a fresh batch of glyoxal-activated agarose. Success of immobilization was determined by measuring protein concentration in the buffer before and after coupling and was estimated to be 2.6 and 1.6 mg of IgG per ml of resin after first and second coupling, respectively. Unreacted sites on coupled resin were blocked with 10 mm ethanolamine, pH 8.0 (2 h at 24 °C). IgG-resin was washed sequentially with 10 volumes of each of the following: PBS, 17 Triton X-100 in PBS, PBS, 2 m NaCl in PBS, and PBS and stored in PBS containing 0.017 thimerosal (Sigma) at 4 °C. Immediately before use in immunoaffinity purification of ISG15 conjugates the IgG-resin was washed with 10 volumes of 0.1m glycine, pH 2.5. Thymus samples were obtained (with ethical approval) from children (aged 1–10 years) during routine cardiac surgery. Nine grams of tissue were macerated with a razor blade and homogenized using a tissue homogenizer in 25 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.17 w/v SDS, 17 v/v Triton X-100, 0.57 w/v sodium deoxycholate, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, product number P2714)). The slurry was sonicated (four 30-s pulses), and insoluble material was removed by 10-min centrifugation at 18,000 × g. This extraction procedure yielded 500 mg of total protein. Supernatant was stored at −80 °C and passed through a 0.4-ॖm filter immediately before use in immunoaffinity purification. In a series of pilot experiments we established that certain ISG15 conjugates would bind to IgG-resin inefficiently at pH 8.0 but bound efficiently at pH 7.0. The addition of ethylene glycol improved conditions for binding of an overlapping but distinct set of ISG15 conjugates. Combination of pH 7.0 with ethylene glycol, on the other hand, resulted in massive binding of certain nonspecific proteins. We therefore adopted the following two-step protocol. IgG-resin (0.5 ml) was mixed with thymic protein extract (250 mg of total protein, at a final concentration of 3 mg/ml) in RIPA buffer, pH 7.0, final volume 83 ml. Binding of ISG15 conjugates was carried out overnight at 4 °C. The resin was then washed three times with 20 volumes of RIPA buffer, pH 7.0, and stored at −20 °C. The protein extract was adjusted to pH 8.0, and ethylene glycol was added to a final concentration of 257 v/v. Fresh IgG-resin was added, and binding was carried out as above. The resin was washed three times with 20 volumes of RIPA buffer, pH 8.0, and 257 ethylene glycol and stored at −20 °C. Bound proteins resulting from both steps were eluted from IgG-resins by the addition of 2 volumes of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and a 5-min incubation at 90 °C. The ISG15 conjugates from both binding steps (pH 8.0 and pH 7.0, 257 ethylene glycol) were pooled and analyzed by high-throughput Western blot. Primary screening (pay per service) was performed at BD Biosciences Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) using the PowerBlotTM assay. Briefly, the purified ISG15 conjugates were separated on six high-resolution gradient gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Each membrane was divided into 40 lanes by applying a chamber-forming grid. To each chamber a mixture of mAbs was added (1–8 mAbs per mixture; identities of mAbs and location with respect to lanes and templates are available from BD Biosciences Transduction Laboratories). After 1 h of incubation at room temperature the chambers were rinsed and incubated with secondary antibodies under the same conditions (Alexa 680-labeled goat anti-mouse IgGs; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The images were acquired with an infrared scanner (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). The bands were identified, and molecular masses were assessed using specialized software by the service. Each observed band, where possible, was manually matched against the expected molecular mass of a protein recognized by an individual antibody in the mixture. The computer-generated data were scrutinized in our laboratory by careful manual analysis and were found to be more than 907 accurate. To verify the results of the primary screen we performed immunoprecipitations (IPs) with additional controls as well as reciprocal IPs. Anti-Stat1 (rabbit polyclonal, antipeptide) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-ERK1, anti-PLCγ1, and anti-Jak1 mAbs were purchased from BD Biosciences Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit anti-human ISG15 polyclonal antibodies were previously described (24D'Cunha J. Ramanujam S. Wagner R.J. Witt P.L. Knight Jr., E. Borden E.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4100-4108PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-mouse ISG15 polyclonal antibodies were generated as follows. Murine ISG17 (pro-ISG15) was PCR-amplified (primers TGGAATTCTTAGGCACACTGGTCCCC and AATTCGATTCTGGATCCGCCTGGGACC) from a cDNA library (a kind gift of Drs. M. Robek and S. Uprichard, The Scripps Research Institute) prepared from hepatitis B virus -infected hepatocytes and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The correct sequence was verified by sequencing, the insert excised with BamHI andSalI restriction endonucleases and recloned into respective sites of pQE-30 vector (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to yield His6-tagged ISG17. His6-ISG17 was then expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Rabbit sera were generated by Covance (Denver, PA). Anti-ISG15-specific IgGs were immunoaffinity-purified on immobilized His6-ISG15 and depleted against immobilized Ub (Sigma) to remove any cross-reacting IgGs. His6-ISG15 and Ub were immobilized on glyoxal-activated agarose as described above for mAbs. With the exception of anti-ERK1 (lysate was prepared in denaturing conditions as recommended by the manufacturer of mAbs), all lysates were prepared and IPs were performed in RIPA buffer. Protein A-Sepharose was used with polyclonal antibodies, and protein G-Sepharose was used with mAbs. Western blotting was performed as previously described (12Malakhov M.P. Malakhova O.A. Kim K.I. Ritchie K.J. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9976-9981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Wild type andUBP43−/− MEFs (murine embryonic fibroblasts) were generated from a litter of embryos on embryonic day 12.5. Briefly, embryonic torsos were minced and trypsinized for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum, and plated on 10-cm dishes. MEFs (9 × 105) were plated on 60-mm plates and replated every 3 days for over 20 passages until they were immortalized. Where indicated MEFs were treated with 200 units/ml of IFNऔ, 5 ॖm lactacystin, and 10 ॖm MG132 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Thymocytes and bone marrow cells were isolated from 4–6 week-old mice and were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Bone marrow cultures were also supplemented with the following growth factors: 10 ng/ml interleukin-3, 10 ng/ml interleukin-6, and 100 ng/ml stem cell factor (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ). ISGylated proteins purified from human thymus by immunoaffinity chromatography were submitted for analysis by BD Transduction Laboratories. The proteins in this assay separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane is divided into multiple lanes. Each individual lane is incubated with a blend of several specifically selected monoclonal antibodies that recognize proteins of non-overlapping molecular weights (see “Materials and Methods” for further details). The assay uses 860 individual mAbs of which 710 cross-react with human proteins. Some of the mAbs were different clones recognizing the same protein or phosphorylated versions of the same protein. Therefore, 645 individual proteins can be detected by this technology in various human tissues and cells. Computer-assisted and subsequent manual examination of detected signals revealed 149 bands. Based on the confidence with which the identity of the protein could be deduced we separated the bands into three groups. Group one (72 bands) included proteins that (a) matched very well the expected molecular mass of unmodified proteins and (b) were unlikely to be the result of a smaller protein that has been modified by ISG15. Proteins of this group most likely were nonspecifically bound to IgG-resin (either agarose itself or IgGs) but also might have been co-purified with ISGylated protein(s). Group one was treated as irrelevant and is not discussed in this study. Group two (73 bands) incorporated the bands of ambiguous identity. Apparent molecular masses of group two bands corresponded to an expected molecular mass of an unmodified protein but also may correspond to a molecular mass of another protein modified by one or two molecules of ISG15. The proteins that belong to this group are currently being validated in our laboratory. Molecular masses of group 3 proteins (three bands or groups of bands) did not correspond to any protein and were considered as the candidates likely to be ISG15-modified. Fig. 1 shows three fragments of respective Western blot panels. PLCγ1 was represented by four bands migrating in the range of 145–185 kDa (fragment A), whereas ERK1 and Jak1 were represented by single bands of 57 and 145 kDa, respectively. The molecular masses of these bands (with the exception of the 145-kDa band recognized by PLCγ1, which may be a product of proteolysis; see Figs. 2, 3 and “Discussion”) were in good correlation with expected shifts in mobility upon addition of one or more molecules of ISG15.Figure 2ISG15-modified PLCγ1, ERK1, and Jak1 are detected in reciprocal immunoprecipitations.A, proteins were precipitated with nonspecific isotype control mAbs (N) or with specific anti-ISG15 mAb (S). Ten micrograms of whole cell lysate were loaded (L) to locate positions of unmodified proteins (shown witharrows). Panels were probed with anti-PLCγ1, anti-Jak1, or anti-ERK1 monoclonal antibodies. B, proteins were precipitated with nonspecific isotype control mAbs (N) or with specific (S) anti-PLCγ1, anti-Jak1, or anti-ERK1 monoclonal antibodies. Panels were probed with rabbit anti-human ISG15 antibodies (left) and reprobed with the antibodies used for IP (right).

Positions of molecular mass markers and immunoglobulin heavy chain (HC) are shown on theleft.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3PLCγ1 and ERK1 are modified by ISG15 in murine embryonic fibroblasts. IGS15 conjugates were immunoprecipitated from untreated or IFNऔ-inducedUBP43+/+ and IFNऔ-inducedUBP43−/− MEFs. Immunocomplexes (lanes 1–3) and cell lysates (lane 4) were subjected to Western blot with anti-PLCγ1 and anti-ERK1 mAbs. Positions of unmodified proteins are shown with arrows, and positions of conjugates are shown with asterisks. Positions of molecular mass standards and location of IgG heavy chain (HC) are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To validate the results of high-throughput Western blot analysis we performed IPs with anti-ISG15 mAb and analyzed the immunocomplexes by Western blot with anti-PLCγ1, anti-Jak1, and anti-ERK1 mAbs. Bands identical to those observed on high throughput immunoblotting images were detected only when specific anti-ISG15 mAb but not when an isotype control IgG were used for IP (Fig. 2A). We consequently performed reciprocal IPs with individual mAbs against PLCγ1, Jak1, and ERK1 (Fig.2B). Immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blot with polyclonal rabbit anti-human ISG15 antibodies, and again, the signals corresponding to ISGylated proteins were detected. These results strongly suggest that PLCγ1, Jak1, and ERK1 are ISGylated proteins. The anti-ERK1 mAbs (BD Biosciences Transduction Laboratories, catalog number 610030) recognize both the 44- and 42-kDa bands that may represent ERK1 and ERK2, respectively. It is therefore not excluded that ISG15-modified protein identified in our work may be ERK2. Our laboratory has developed a knock-out mouse model in which a gene coding for the ISG15-specific protease UBP43 is deleted (19Ritchie K.J. Malakhov M.P. Hetherington C. Zhou L. Little M.T. Malakhova O.A. Sipe J. Zhang D.E. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2207-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Most tissues ofUBP43−/− mice have a massive increase of ISG15 conjugates, relative to wild type. This difference can be further increased following dosing with LPS or poly(I-C). We used MEFs derived from UBP43−/− andUBP43+/+ mice to assess the relevance of our findings in human tissue to the murine model. MEFs of both genotypes were incubated with IFNऔ for 24 h. ISGylated proteins were immunoprecipitated with purified rabbit anti-mouse ISG15 antibodies, and immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blot. The results presented in Fig. 3 demonstrate that murine PLCγ1 and ERK1 are also modified by ISG15. The modification, however, was only obvious after IFNऔ treatment and, as expected, was stronger in theUBP43−/− cells. Interestingly, the band of 145 kDa that was detectable with anti-PLCγ1 in immunoprecipitates from human thymus was also present in MEFs and was likely to be a product of specific proteolysis of ISGylated PLCγ1. We were not able to detect ISGylation of Jak1 in MEFs; however, the modification was detectable in murine thymocytes (not shown) suggesting that the set of ISGylated proteins may be cell-specific. In a separate paper we report that Stat1, a transcription factor and substrate of Jak1, remains activated for a longer period of time in UBP43−/− cells (20Malakhova O. Yan M. Malakhov M.P. Yuan Y. Ritchie K.J. Kim K.I. Peterson L.F. Shuai K. Zhang D.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In many Western blot experiments, whereUBP43−/− animals or isolated cells were challenged with Jak-Stat activators we observed the appearance of higher molecular mass bands recognized by Stat1 antibodies (Fig.4A). We hypothesized that these high molecular mass bands were Stat1 molecules conjugated by ISG15. Reciprocal immunoprecipitations and Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Stat1 and ISG15 revealed the presence of up to five specific bands that are likely to be Stat1-ISG15 conjugates (Fig. 4B). The two bands (Stat1α/औ, 91 and 84 kDa) corresponding to unmodified Stat1 are non-specifically recognized by ISG15 antibodies due to the overload of Stat1 from immunoprecipitation using Stat1 antibodies. These two bands also appeared on the membrane with Ponceau S staining (Fig. 4B, left panels). Noticeably, the same bands corresponding to unmodified Stat1α/औ are detectable with anti-Stat1 in the proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-ISG15 (Fig. 4B, right panels). Stat1 is known to form homodimers (25Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev.

In addition, other proteins that interact with Stat1 to form ISGF3 and other complexes may be ISGylated and cause the copurification of unmodified Stat1. To answer the question whether Stat1 is ISGylated in human thymus we performed Western blot with anti-Stat1 on purified ISG15 conjugates, the same preparation that was used for high throughput immunoblotting (Fig.4C). A banding pattern similar to that observed in murine T-cells (Fig. 4B) was detected. Attachment of monoubiquitin to its target protein serves to modulate activity or location (26Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). However, the major function of ubiquitin is the formation of polyubiquitin chains and localization of targeted proteins to proteasomes for subsequent degradation (27Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar, 28Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Loeb and Haas (7Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) point out that pulse studies by Knight and Cordova (29Knight Jr., E. Cordova B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2280-2284PubMed Google Scholar) indicated rapid turnover of both free and conjugated ISG15. It is not known whether conjugated ISG15 may act as Ub and direct the conjugated proteins for proteasomal degradation. Although reports point to the evidence (or absence of such) against it, no experimental data have been presented (7Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hamerman J.A. Hayashi F. Schroeder L.A. Gygi S.P. Haas A.L. Hampson L. Coughlin P. Aebersold R. Aderem A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2415-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).UBP43−/− cells, due to the absence of ISG15 deconjugation, appear to be an excellent model to analyze the relation between Ub, ISG15, and the proteasome. We treatedUBP43+/+ and UBP43−/−cells, uninduced or IFNऔ-induced, with a highly specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Western blot revealed no difference in the amount of ISG15 conjugates between lactacystin-treated and untreated samples, while as expected, an increase in the amount of ubiquitinated proteins was observed (Fig.5A). Noticeably, the level of ISGylation had no detectable effect on the appearance of Ub conjugates in either UBP43−/− orUBP43+/+ cells treated with IFNऔ. To confirm this observation we immunoprecipitated PLCγ1 from MEFs treated with a proteasome inhibitor and probed immunocomplexes with anti-ISG15 antibodies (Fig. 5B). Consistent with the data of total protein analysis we did not observe any increase in the amount of ISGylated PLCγ1 upon inhibition of proteasomes. These results demonstrate that ISGylated proteins are not degraded by proteasomes and suggest that ISGylation does not prevent conjugation of polyubiquitin. A protein modified by ISG15 acquires two new characteristics: gains affinity to anti-ISG15 antibodies and migrates more slowly on SDS-PAGE. We used these features to our advantage and identified candidate proteins modified by ISG15. High throughput immunoblotting service was originally developed for comparative analysis of two or more samples (e.g. protein extracts from normal and diseased tissues) with the intent to identify proteins whose levels are altered. Our work proves that this method is a useful tool for identification of post-translationally modified proteins in samples enriched for the modified speci"
https://openalex.org/W2052749020,"Specification of embryonic polarity and pattern formation in multicellular organisms requires inductive signals from neighboring cells. One approach toward understanding these interactions is to study mutations that disrupt development. Here, we demonstrate that mesd, a gene identified in the mesoderm development (mesd) deletion interval on mouse chromosome 7, is essential for specification of embryonic polarity and mesoderm induction. MESD functions in the endoplasmic reticulum as a specific chaperone for LRP5 and LRP6, which in conjunction with Frizzled, are coreceptors for canonical WNT signal transduction. Disruption of embryonic polarity and mesoderm differentiation in mesd-deficient embryos likely results from a primary defect in WNT signaling. However, phenotypic differences between mesd-deficient and wnt3(-)(/)(-) embryos suggest that MESD may function on related members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family, whose members mediate diverse cellular processes ranging from cargo transport to signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2146291151,"Metamorphosis of the Drosophila brain involves pruning of many larval-specific dendrites and axons followed by outgrowth of adult-specific processes. From a genetic mosaic screen, we recovered two independent mutations that block neuronal remodeling in the mushroom bodies (MBs). These phenotypically indistinguishable mutations affect Baboon function, a Drosophila TGF-beta/activin type I receptor, and dSmad2, its downstream transcriptional effector. We also show that Punt and Wit, two type II receptors, act redundantly in this process. In addition, knocking out dActivin around the mid-third instar stage interferes with remodeling. Binding of the insect steroid hormone ecdysone to distinct ecdysone receptor isoforms induces different metamorphic responses in various larval tissues. Interestingly, expression of the ecdysone receptor B1 isoform (EcR-B1) is reduced in activin pathway mutants, and restoring EcR-B1 expression significantly rescues remodeling defects. We conclude that the Drosophila Activin signaling pathway mediates neuronal remodeling in part by regulating EcR-B1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1989862537,"Kaposi's sarcoma associated-herpes virus encodes two proteins, MIR (modulator ofimmune recognition) 1 and 2, which are involved in the evasion of host immunity. MIR1 and 2 have been shown to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for immune recognition-related molecules (e.g. major histocompatibility complex class I, B7-2, and ICAM-1) through the BKS (bovine herpesvirus 4,Kaposi's sarcoma associated-herpes virus, andSwinepox virus) subclass of plant homeodomain (PHD) domain, termed the BKS-PHD domain. Here we show that the human genome also encodes a novel BKS-PHD domain-containing protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and whose putative substrate is the B7-2 co-stimulatory molecule. This novel E3 ubiquitin ligase was designated as c-MIR (cellular MIR) based on its functional and structural similarity to MIR1 and 2. Forced expression of c-MIR induced specific down-regulation of B7-2 surface expression through ubiquitination, rapid endocytosis, and lysosomal degradation of the target molecule. This specific targeting was dependent upon the binding of c-MIR to B7-2. Replacing the BKS-PHD domain of MIR1 with the corresponding domain of c-MIR did not alter MIR1 function. The discovery of c-MIR, a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase, highlights the possibility that viral immune regulatory proteins originated in the host genome and presents unique functions of BKS-PHD domain-containing proteins in mammals.

Notably, MIR1 and MIR2 have been shown to function as E3 ubiquitin ligase and the BKS (bovine herpesvirus 4, KSHV, and Swinepox virus) subclass of plant homeodomain (PHD) domain, termed the BKS-PHD domain, was identified as a catalytic domain of their E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (6Coscoy L. Sanchez D.J. Ganem D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The BKS-PHD domain was designated based on its existence in bovine herpesvirus, KSHV, and Swinepox virus genome (8Nicholas J. Ruvolo V. Zong J. Ciufo D. Guo H.G. Reitz M.S. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1963-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This domain was classified as a subclass of the PHD domain because of an interval difference between the third and fourth cysteine residues in a zinc-binding motif. The PHD domain has been found in many proteins involved in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation, but their functions remain unknown. Although KSHV MIRs and murine γ-herpesvirus 68 K3 share the same structure and the same positioning of BKS-PHD, they utilize distinct pathways for degradation of MHC I; KSHV MIRs lead target molecules to lysosomal degradation (1Coscoy L. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8051-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 9Means R.E. Ishido S. Alvarez X. Jung J.U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1638-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas murine γ-herpesvirus 68 K3 causes proteasomal degradation (3Stevenson P.G. Efstathiou S. Doherty P.C. Lehner P.J. Proc.

Nevertheless, the BKS-PHD domain has been shown to be a critical domain for ubiquitination and degradation of MHC I in all cases. The PHD domain has a similar structure to the RING (reallyinteresting new gene) domain, which is a functionally critical domain for several E3 ubiquitin ligases such as c-Cbl and Hakai (10Joazeiro C.A.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7085-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). c-Cbl and Hakai-mediated ubiquitination requires tyrosine phosphorylation of targets and induces rapid endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of targets (10Joazeiro C.A.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7085-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This is the case with MIR1 and MIR2. The expression of MIR1 or MIR2 induces rapid endocytosis, translocation to the trans-Golgi network, and lysosomal degradation of MHC I (1Coscoy L. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8051-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 9Means R.E. Ishido S. Alvarez X. Jung J.U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1638-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The BKS-PHD domain of MIR1 has been shown to be a functionally critical domain for the endocytosis of MHC I (9Means R.E. Ishido S. Alvarez X. Jung J.U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1638-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, the PHD domain of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 1 has also been shown to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and to induce ERK degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner (14Lu Z. Xu S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These findings gave rise to the question as to where the viral BKS-PHD domain-containing proteins are derived from. The genomes of large DNA viruses including herpesviruses carry many homologs of host cellular proteins. Likewise, the KSHV genome encodes homologs of many human genes (e.g. viral interleukin-6 (v-IL-6) and viral macrophage inflammatory protein (v-MIP)), which have been implicated in viral pathogenesis (15Choi J. Means R.E. Damania B. Jung J.U. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that viral BKS-PHD domain-containing proteins might also have originated in the host genome. To justify this hypothesis, we searched the human protein data base of Celera Genomics (16Venter J.C. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10698) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics and experimental analysis led us to discover that the human genome contains a gene encoding a novel BKS-PHD domain-containing protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and whose putative substrate is the B7-2 co-stimulatory molecule. Based on its functional and structural similarity to KSHV MIR1 and MIR2, we have designated this novel E3 ubiquitin ligase as c-MIR (cellular MIR). Although overall sequence similarity between c-MIR and KSHV MIRs is low, they share the same secondary structure. Forced expression of c-MIR causes polyubiquitination, rapid endocytosis, and lysosomal degradation of B7-2 specifically. This specific targeting is achieved through binding to the transmembrane and/or cytoplasmic regions of B7-2. Furthermore, the BKS-PHD domain of c-MIR functioned in the context of KSHV MIR1. This finding highlights the possibility that viral immune regulatory proteins originated in the host genome and shows unique functions of mammalian BKS-PHD domain-containing proteins. To look for the candidates of KSHV MIR1,2 homolog, the data base of Celera Genomics was searched using the program BLAST-P, which allowed a search for patterns in translated nucleic acid sequences data bases (16Venter J.C. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10698) Google Scholar). For cloning of the cDNA coding human c-MIR, total RNA isolated from BJAB cells were reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript RT kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To determine the 5′ and 3′ ends of the entire coding sequence of c-MIR cDNA, 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends were performed using a GeneRacerTM kit (Invitrogen). A full-length cDNA of c-MIR was obtained by PCR and subcloned into the pEF-1 vector and GFP co-expression vector pTracer EF-1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced by a model 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The putative secondary structure and transmembrane topology of c-MIR were examined by Profile fed neural network system from HeiDelberg (PHD) (17Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 20: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 18Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar, 19Rost B. Fariselli P. Casadio R. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1704-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). For the detection of c-MIR mRNA from human tissues, PCR-ready cDNA kits (Maxim Biotech) were subjected to PCR analysis with the specific primers, 5′-CGCGAATTCGCCGCCATGAGCATGCCACTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGCTCTAGAGACGTGAATGATTTCTGCTCC-3′ (reverse) to detect the full-length human c-MIR mRNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. For detection of mRNA from cultured cells, total RNA was extracted by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), and 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed. 400 ng of cDNA was subjected to PCR analysis as described above. Each PCR product was subcloned into pEF-1 and verified by DNA sequencing. Antibody directed against c-MIR was produced by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide, DAISARVYRSKTKEKEREE, corresponding to amino acids of 15–33 of c-MIR. The rabbits were immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptides in complete adjuvant, followed by antisera preparation. A one-step RT-PCR analysis was performed using the QuantiTectTM SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). 50 ng of total RNA was analyzed according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The SYBR Green fluorescence was measured after each elongation using an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). After PCR amplification, a melting curve analysis was performed by increasing the temperature from 60 to 95 °C. To assess the purity of the amplicons of interest, RT-PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The intensity of the SYBR Green fluorescent signal was converted into a relative number of copies of interest based on the results of a series of standards prepared by successive dilution of total RNA. The expression level of glyceraldehye-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was determined for normalization of the data set. Each experiment was performed twice using duplicate samples from independently generated cDNA templates. B7-2 cDNA was obtained from total RNA of BJAB cells by RT-PCR and subcloned into pEF-1. HLA-A2 and CD8 cDNA were kindly provided by Dr. G. Cohen (20Cohen G.B. Gandhi R.T. Davis D.M. Mandelboim O. Chen B.K. Strominger J.L. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1999; 10: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Each CD8 chimera was constructed by overlapping PCR as described previously (2Ishido S. Wang C. Lee B.S. Cohen G.B. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5300-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 21Ishido S. Choi J.K. Lee B.S. Wang C. DeMaria M. Johnson R.P. Cohen G.B. Jung J.U. Immunity. 2000; 13: 365-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Substitutions were engineered into each chimera by PCR-based mutagenesis (Promega). For analysis by two-color flow cytometry, each cDNA was subcloned into the GFP co-expression vector pTracer EF-1. To introduce a FLAG epitope tag, each cDNA was subcloned into p3XFLAG-CMV vector (Sigma). To construct plasmid DNAs for GST fusion proteins, a fragment encoding the c-MIR BKS-PHD domain was amplified by PCR and then subcloned into pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). BJAB, 293T, and A7 cells (ATCC) were grown in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and minimum essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum. For transient assays, expression plasmid DNAs were introduced by electroporation at 260 V and 975 microfarads in serum-free RPMI medium or by transfection with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To select stable transformants, 2 mg/ml of G418 (Sigma) was added 48 h post-transfection, and the cells were maintained in selective medium for 3–6 weeks. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy volunteers were separated from peripheral blood by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation. The monocytes were obtained from PBMCs using the MACS monocyte isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec), which depletes T cells, NK cells, B cells, and basophils from PBMC using a mixture of hapten-conjugated CD3, CD7, CD19, CD45RA, CD56, and anti-IgE antibodies. Immature DCs were generated by culturing monocytes at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml for 7 days; granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (2000 units/ml; R&D Systems) and interleukin-4 (3000 units/ml; R&D Systems) were added on days 0 and 4. The cell fraction remaining after monocyte isolation was collected and used as a source of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). For metabolic labeling, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), washed once with labeling medium (RPMI minus methionine and cysteine plus 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum), and then incubated with 5 ml of the same medium containing 50 μCi of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 6 h. For pulse-chase analysis, the cells were labeled for 30 min and chased for the indicated time. For immunoprecipitation, the cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation was performed with the indicated antibody together with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz). For PNGase-F digestion, washed immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of 1× denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol), heated for 10 min at 100 °C, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 1 μl of PNGase-F (New England Biolabs). The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde PBS for 15 min and cold acetone for 15 min. Fixed cells were stained with 1:100 diluted primary antibody in PBS for 30 min. After incubation, the cells were washed extensively with PBS and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of Alexa 488 or 568-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) in PBS for 30 min. Finally, the cells were washed three times with PBS and mounted in mounting medium (Vector). The cells (5 × 105) were washed with RPMI medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated monoclonal antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. After being washed, each sample was fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde solution, and flow cytometry analysis was performed with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). W6/32 antibody for MHC I, RPA-T8 antibody for CD8, HA 58 antibody for ICAM-1, L307.4 for B7–1, and FUN-1 antibody for B7-2 used for FACScan were obtained from PharMingen Becton Dickinson Company. The M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), F7 anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz), G-18 anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz), P4D1 anti-ubiquitin antibody (Santa Cruz), and the anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) were used for immunoprecipitation and/or immunoblot analysis. The experiments were performed as described previously (2Ishido S. Wang C. Lee B.S. Cohen G.B. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5300-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 9Means R.E. Ishido S. Alvarez X. Jung J.U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1638-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, c-MIR cells or control BJAB cells were stained with PE-labeled anti-B7-2 antibody at 4 °C and then incubated for various periods of time at 37 °C. The cells were then washed in an acidic solution to remove uninternalized antibodies, fixed, and subjected to flow cytometry. For confocal microscopy analysis, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled B7-2 antibody was added to the culture medium of control BJAB cells or c-MIR cells and then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After being washed, these cells were subjected to analysis with a confocal immunofluorescence microscope (Bio-Rad). Each plasmid DNA was transfected into 293T cells using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 48 h, the transfected cells were harvested, lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer, immunoprecipitated as described above, and subjected to serial immunoblots as indicated in each experiment. For in vitroauto-ubiquitination assay, the GST fusion proteins were produced as follow. Expression of GST fusion proteins was induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside for 3–6 h. Bacterial pellets were sonicated in PBS containing protease inhibitors and 0.1% Triton X-100. After being cleared by centrifugation, bacterial lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). 10 μg of precipitated GST fusion proteins were mixed with 1 μg of UbcH5a (Boston Biochem), 2 μg of His-tagged ubiquitin (Calbiochem), and 40 ng of E1 (Calbiochem) in the auto-ubiquitination buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μm MG132), incubated at 35 °C for 3 h, and subjected to immunoblot with anti-ubiquitin antibody. We found a BKS-PHD domain-containing putative protein, hCP36279, that shares the same secondary structure and the same positioning of BKS-PHD domain with MIR1 and MIR2 in the data base of Celera Genomics (16Venter J.C. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10698) Google Scholar). Because amino-terminal sequences of hCP36279 were missing in the public data base, 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis was performed using cap-trapping methods. We determined the full sequence of an hCP36279 cDNA cloned from the BJAB B cell line (Fig. 1A). Overall hCP36279 has 12 and 18% amino acid identity to MIR1 and MIR2, respectively. However, within their BKS-PHD domains, hCP36279 exhibits 36 and 42% amino acid identity compared with MIR1 and MIR2, respectively (Fig. 1B). hCP36279 was predicted to have two intracytoplasmic regions, helical transmembrane regions separated by an extra-cytoplasmic domain, and a BKS-PHD domain located in the putative amino-terminal intracytoplasmic region. The predicted structure of hCP36279 is depicted schematically, together with those of MIR1 and MIR2, in Fig. 1C. To examine the functional similarity of this protein to MIR1 and MIR2, His-tagged protein was transiently expressed in BJAB cells by electroporation, and the surface expression of immune recognition-related molecules was analyzed by two-color flow cytometry. As shown in Fig.2A, B7-2 surface expression was significantly down-regulated, but not MHC I and ICAM-1. The FLAG-tagged version also exhibited the same function (data not shown). Based on these findings, this protein has been designated as c-MIR. To confirm these findings, BJAB cell lines were engineered to have stable and excess expression of c-MIR (c-MIR cells) and examined for surface expression of immune recognition-related molecules by flow cytometry. In this experiment, the examination of B7–1 was included to confirm the target specificity of c-MIR. The stable expression of exogenous c-MIR (His-tagged c-MIR) was confirmed by immunoprecipitation from the metabolically labeled cell lysate with an anti-His antibody (Fig.2B, left panel). Real time RT-PCR analysis showed that the c-MIR expression level of c-MIR cells was 57-fold higher than that of control BJAB cells (Fig. 2B, right panel). Flow cytometry analysis showed that the surface expression of B7-2 was specifically down-regulated on c-MIR cells (Fig.2C).Figure 2hCP36279, renamed as c-MIR, is a functional homolog of KSHV MIR1 and MIR2.A, BJAB cells were transfected with the GFP-c-MIR vector by electroporation. The surface expression of each molecule and the expression of GFP were analyzed 24 h post-transfection by two-color flow cytometry as in previous experiments (2Ishido S. Wang C. Lee B.S. Cohen G.B.

In brief, the cells (5 × 105) were washed with RPMI medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and incubated with the indicated PE-conjugated monoclonal antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. After being washed, each sample was fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde solution, and flow cytometry analysis was performed with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). The y axis shows the level of surface expression of MHC I, ICAM-1, and B7-2, and thex axis shows the level of GFP expression. B, theleft panel shows the stable expression of exogenous c-MIR protein in c-MIR cells. c-MIR cells and control BJAB cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 6 h, and metabolically labeled cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-His polyclonal antibody. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In the right panel, the level of c-MIR mRNA was determined by using quantitative RT-PCR in control BJAB cells and c-MIR cells. The expression level of c-MIR was normalized to GAPDH expression and is indicated relative to the expression level in control BJAB cells. All of the reactions were performed in duplicate, and the standard deviation is indicated. C, BJAB cells stably overexpressing c-MIR (c-MIR) and control BJAB cells were stained with the indicated antibodies as described for A, and the surface expression of the indicated molecules was analyzed by flow cytometry. In merged panels, the bold lines and shaded histograms show the results of c-MIR cells and control BJAB cells, respectively. The results of the staining with isotype control antibody are shown as dotted lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 2, c-MIR is able to down-regulate the surface expression of B7-2 in BJAB cells. This finding suggests that c-MIR might be a functional molecule in antigen-presenting cells, because B7-2 is a co-stimulatory molecule for antigen presentation. To test this hypothesis, the expression profile of c-MIR mRNA in various tissues was examined by RT-PCR. The primer set used in this experiment is able to detect full-length c-MIR mRNA (873 bp). As shown in Fig. 3A, full-length c-MIR mRNA was detected in neonatal brain, lymph node, spleen, and placenta. The nucleotide sequence of all PCR products was exactly the same as that of cDNA derived from BJAB cells. In addition, a band slightly bigger than 873 bp was detected in neonatal brain. DNA sequencing analysis revealed that this transcript had additional sequences within full-length c-MIR mRNA, suggesting that it is an immature transcript of c-MIR. Because full-length c-MIR mRNA was detected in lymphoid tissues, we sought to determine whether DCs, which are potent antigen-presenting cells, express c-MIR mRNA or not. Immature DCs were differentiated from monocytes that had been purified from PMBCs by negative selection with anti-CD3, anti-CD7, anti-CD19, anti-CD45RA, anti-CD56, and anti-IgE. 95% of the cells obtained in this way were CD14− CD11c+ (data not shown). The remaining cell fraction from monocyte isolation was collected as PBLs. Immature DCs, monocytes, and PBLs were subjected to RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 3B, c-MIR mRNA was detected in monocytes and DCs but not in PBLs. The intensity of PCR band of DCs was stronger than that of monocytes, suggesting that DCs express c-MIR mRNA more than monocytes. To confirm that DCs express the authentic c-MIR protein, rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against c-MIR was generated. 1 × 107 immature DCs were labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 6h, and metabolically labeled cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-MIR polyclonal antibody (α-c-MIR in Fig.3C) or rabbit preimmune serum (Cont in Fig.3C). To verify the full size of the authentic c-MIR protein, the epitope tag sequences (e.g. V5 and His tag) were deleted from the c-MIR expression plasmid, and the resulting expression plasmid was transfected into 293T cells. Transfected 293T cells (293T+c-MIR in Fig. 3C) or nontransfected 293T cells (293T in Fig. 3C) were labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine and immunoprecipitated with anti-c-MIR antibody or preimmune serum. As shown in Fig. 3C, this antibody was able to precipitate the proteins of the same molecular weight (marked with asterisksin Fig. 3C) from cell lysates of DCs and transfected 293T cells, but not from nontransfected 293T cell lysates. On the other hand, with preimmune serum, a band corresponding to c-MIR was not detected from any cell lysates. These results indicate that immature DCs express the authentic c-MIR protein. Taken together, these findings suggest that c-MIR might be a functional molecule in DCs. To reveal the molecular mechanism of B7-2 down-regulation, protein synthesis, degradation, and the trafficking of B7-2 were examined. c-MIR cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine and chased for the indicated periods of time. At the end of the chase periods, pulse-labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-B7-2 or MHC I antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Because of the high degree of glycosylation of B7-2, fully matured B7-2 molecules (marked withfour small closed triangles in Fig.4A) obviously migrated slower than the immature form (marked with asterisks in Fig.4A). In contrast, fully glycosylated MHC I migrated less slowly than the immature form, probably because of the lower degree of glycosylation. In control cells (Cont), the amount of fully matured B7-2 did not decrease significantly up to 6 h. In contrast, in c-MIR cells (c-MIR), at 3 and 6 h, the amount of fully matured B7-2 was significantly reduced compared with control cells (Fig. 4A). To confirm an enhanced degradation of B7-2, B7-2 was treated with PNGase-F to remove glycans, and the treated protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig.4A, thi"

Because we found disparate regulation of the levels of the two COX-2 transcripts with different 3′-UTRs in HCA-7 cells and in the context of increasing evidence that the 3′-UTR of a number of mRNAs can regulate their stability, we considered the hypothesis that the distal 1888 nt of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 mRNA could participate in post-transcriptional regulation of message abundance.

The 3′-UTRs of some cytokines (e.g. TNF-α and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and proto-oncogenes (e.g. c-fos and c-myc) contribute importantly to the post-transcriptional regulation of message abundance. These 3′-UTRs contain AU-rich elements (AREs) that are the binding sites for proteins that interact with the 3′-UTR to regulate mRNA de-adenylation and decay (32Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell.

When indicated, HCA-7 cells at 50% confluence were stimulated with 10 ng/ml LPS in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 h. When indicated, HUVECs were activated with IL-1α (1 ng/ml; Sigma) for 16 h as described previously (52Boutaud O. Aronoff D.M. Richardson J.H. Marnett L.J. Oates J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7130-7135Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). mRNA was purified from total RNA using a MicroPoly(A) Pure kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Total RNA (15 μg each) or mRNA (450 ng each) was denatured in 50% formamide and 6% formaldehyde and resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gel in MOPS buffer. The RNA was subsequently transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized with32P-labeled cDNAs from human COX-1, COX-2, TTP, and β-actin. COX-2 cDNAs were obtained by PCR amplification of regions located on the end of each variant determined by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE): A, nt 1846–2116; B, nt 2269–2525; C, nt 2578–2852; D, nt 2896–3097; E, nt 3135–3366; F, nt 3544–3834; G, nt 3927–4134; and H, nt 4204–4446. TTP cDNAs were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). cDNAs from human COX-1 (Oxford Biomedical Research, Inc., Oxford, MI) and COX-2, TTP, and β-actin (Ambion Inc.) were labeled with 32P using a random prime labeling system (Rediprime, Amersham Biosciences). The blots were washed five times with 1× SSC with 1% SDS at room temperature and then exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. RNA bands were quantified by densitometry using Scion Image (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Total RNA was extracted from three independent series of cells, and Northern blotting was performed twice with each RNA. RACE was performed using a SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Total RNA was extracted from HCA-7 cells using TRI Reagent, and mRNA was purified from total RNA using the MicroPoly(A) Pure kit. The gene-specific primers were designed in exon 10 of COX-2 with the following criteria: 23–28 nt, 50–70% GC, and Tm > 65 °C. We chose exon 10 because it has the least homology to the COX-1 sequence. Poly(A)+ RNA (mRNA) from HCA-7 cells under confluent conditions (1 μg) was incubated with 5′- or 3′-cDNA synthesis primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 1.5 h. The 5′-RACE PCRs were performed using the gene-specific primer at position 1899 in exon 10 (GSP1, 5′-CTAGTCCGGAGCGGGAAGAACTTGCA) and the template-primer (SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit) and Advantage-GC 2 polymerase (Clontech) to amplify the GC-rich region. The 3′-RACE PCRs were performed using the gene-specific primer at position 1591 in exon 10 (GSP2, CTGTGGAGCTGTATCCTGCCCTTCTGGT) and the template-primer (SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit) and Advantage 2 polymerase (Clontech). The RACE products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.3% agarose gel. The bands of 5′- and 3′-RACE products were cut out from the gel and purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The isolated fragments were cloned directly into a T/A cloning vector (pGEM-T-Easy vector system, Promega, Madison, WI). The identified clones were fully sequenced at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center Sequencing Core Facility by the dideoxy chain termination method using an ABI 3700 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The expression of each of the variants of COX-2 mRNA was evaluated by ribonuclease protection assay (RPA III kit, Ambion Inc.) with human cyclophilin mRNA as an internal standard following the manufacturer's protocol. To prepare the template for human COX-2 riboprobes, target fragments were amplified by PCR. Each template was designed to overlap the end of each of the variants determined by 3′-RACE (A, nt 1950–2341; B, nt 2322–2747; C, nt 2748–3169; D, nt 3168–3579; E, nt 3561–3988; F, nt 3816–4223; and G, nt 3989–4457). The sense primers were designed to contain a BamHI site at their 5′-ends, and the antisense primers were designed to contain the T3 promoter sequence at their 3′-ends to generate antisense RNA probes. The PCR fragments were resolved by electrophoresis, isolated using the QIAquick gel extraction kit, and ligated with the pGEM-T-Easy vector. To synthesize radiolabeled antisense riboprobes, the plasmids were linearized with BamHI (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase (MAXIscript, Ambion Inc.) in the presence of 80 μCi of [α-32P]UTP at 37 °C for 1 h. The full-length radiolabeled riboprobes were purified by preparative electrophoresis on an 8 m urea and 5% acrylamide denaturing gel and eluted into 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% SDS at 37 °C for 16 h. For ribonuclease protection assay, 10 μg of total RNA was hybridized with [α-32P]UTP-labeled antisense RNA probes complementary to human COX-2 mRNA or human cyclophilin mRNA (Ambion Inc.). After hybridization overnight at 45 °C and digestion with 7.5 units of RNase T1 (Ambion Inc.), the protected mRNA fragments were denatured and then resolved on an 8 m urea and 5% acrylamide gel. The gels were exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. COX-2 mRNA abundance in each sample was normalized to the abundance of constitutively expressed cyclophilin mRNA to control for RNA loading. Following RNA extraction, the proteins were extracted using TRI Reagent. The protein extract was denatured at 70 °C in the presence of NuPAGETM lithium dodecyl sulfate loading buffer and loaded on a 10% acrylamide NuPAGETM BisTris gel from Novex (San Diego, CA). The proteins were separated by electrophoresis using the NuPAGETM MES running buffer from Novex. At the end of the electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 30 V for 1 h. The nonspecific sites were blocked with 5% dry skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (Sigma), and the blot was incubated with anti-human COX-2 antibody or anti-human β-actin antibody (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with the secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:2000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature, the proteins were detected with luminous ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). COX-2 activity in HCA-7 cells was evaluated by measurement of prostaglandin E2. [2H8]Arachidonic acid (Sigma) was added to fresh serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at concentration of 20.0 μm. After 15 min at 37 °C, the medium was removed. [2H4]Prostaglandin E2 (2 ng) was added to the samples as an internal standard. Prostaglandins were isolated and derivatized for analysis by gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization/mass spectrometry, monitoring selected ions, as described previously (53Boutaud O. Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Roberts II, L.J. Oates J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9389-9396Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The signal for the internal standard ([2H4]prostaglandin E2) is m/z 528. To account for the deuterium-protium exchange at C-12 of [2H7]prostaglandin E2, summation of the signals obtained at m/z 530, 531, andm/z 532 was performed (54Roberts II, L.J. Lewis R.A. Oates J.A. Austen K.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 575: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The interactions between TTP protein and COX-2 RNA were evaluated by RNA-protein cross-linking and immunoprecipitation. To prepare the template for human COX-2 sense riboprobes, target fragments were amplified by PCR. Each template was designed to correspond to the end of each variant determined by 3′-RACE: nt 1941–2211, 2189–2599, 2581–2858, 2842–3151, 3125–3432, 3409–3822, 3801–4225, and 4207–4446. The sense primers were designed to contain the T3 promoter at their 5′-ends, and the antisense primers were designed to containBamHI sequence at their 3′-ends to generate sense RNA probes. The PCR fragments were resolved by electrophoresis, isolated using the QIAquick gel extraction kit, and ligated with the pGEM-T-Easy vector. To synthesize radiolabeled sense riboprobes, the plasmids were linearized with BamHI and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase (MAXIscript) in the presence of 80 μCi of [α-32P]UTP at 37 °C for 1 h. Cytoplasmic cell lysates were prepared from HCA-7 cells grown in T-75 flasks at 37 °C to 50, 70, 90, and 100% confluence or overconfluence for 3 days. They were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and 2 ml of lysis buffer (25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) was added. The cells were frozen at −70 °C. The thawed cells were scraped from the plate, vortexed shortly, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was assayed for protein concentration and keep frozen at −70 °C. UV cross-linking experiments were performed as described previously (55Dixon D.A. Kaplan C.D. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11750-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In brief, the cell lysates (10 μg) were incubated with 1 × 105 cpm of sense RNA probe in RNA binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol) in a total volume of 40 μl. The reaction mixtures were UV-irradiated in 96-well plates using a Stratalinker 9600 (Stratagene) for 5 min and then incubated with 10 μg of RNase A and 5 units of RNase T1 for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the radioactivity associated with proteins was visualized by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation was performed using 200 μl of UV-cross-linked samples. Three affinity-purified goat polyclonal antibodies specific for TTP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used: G-20, raised against the amino terminus of the mouse protein; P-20, raised against the carboxyl terminus of the human protein; and N-18, raised against the amino terminus of the human protein. The antibodies (2 μg) were added to the samples in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) and incubated for 5 h at 4 °C with agitation. Then, 20 μl of protein G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the mixplus the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with agitation. The pellets were collected by centrifugation at 2500 ×g for 2 min and washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the radioactivity associated with the proteins was visualized by autoradiography. The pcDNA3.1-FLAG-TTP expression construct (under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter) containing the human TTP coding region (nucleotides 10–990) was a generous gift from Dr. William Rigby (Dartmouth University) (56Brooks S.A. Connolly J.E. Diegel R.J. Fava R.A. Rigby W.F. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of HCA-7 cells was performed using Cellfectin (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 50% confluent HCA-7 cells in T-75 flasks were washed with Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen). The TTP DNA (7.5 μg) in 500 μl of Opti-MEM I and Cellfectin (15 μl) in 500 μl of Opti-MEM were combined and added to the cells. After 18 h, the DNA-containing medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. RNA and proteins were extracted from the cells using TRI Reagent. The data are presented as means ± S.E. and were compared by unpaired t test or by one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher's PLSD procedure. The criterion for statistical significance wasp < 0.05. Northern blot analysis of mRNA from HCA-7 cells using a COX-2-specific probe showed two bands migrating at ∼4.5 and 2.6 kb (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the smaller species was the more abundant in confluent HCA-7 cells. By comparison, the longest species at 4.5 kb was the main transcript in Moser cells (Fig. 1B) (50Shao J. Sheng H.

However, after activation by IL-1α, HUVECs also expressed two transcripts of COX-2, the main one being 4.5 kb long. Because full-length COX-1 mRNA is 2.5 kb long, we investigated whether the small transcripts in HCA-7 and Moser cells were due to cross-reactivity of our probe with COX-1 RNA by analyzing the same total RNA by Northern blotting using a probe specific for COX-1. As shown in Fig. 1C, a band at ∼2.5 kb was observed in HUVECs grown under normal conditions or after activation with IL-1α. On the contrary, both HCA-7 and Moser cells did not express COX-1. This indicates that the small transcript of 2.5 kb present in HCA-7 is specific to COX-2. We performed 5′- and 3′-RACE using the gene-specific primer located in the coding region of exon 10 because it has the least homology to COX-1. Analysis of HCA-7 mRNA by 5"
https://openalex.org/W2108521165,"High grade glioma cells derived from patient biopsies express an amiloride-sensitive sodium conductance that has properties attributed to the human brain sodium channel family, also known as acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs). This amiloride-sensitive conductance was not detected in cells obtained from normal brain tissue or low grade or benign tumors. Differential gene profiling data showed that ASIC1 and ASIC2 mRNA were present in normal and low grade tumor cells. Although ASIC1 was present in all of the high grade glial cells examined, ASIC2 mRNA was detected in less than half. The main purpose of our work was to examine the molecular mechanisms that may underlie the constitutively activated sodium currents present in high grade glioma cells. Our results show that 1) gain-of-function mutations of ASIC1 were not present in a number of freshly resected and cultured high grade gliomas, 2) syntaxin 1A inhibited ASIC currents only when ASIC1 and ASIC2 were co-expressed, and 3) the inhibition of ASIC currents by syntaxin 1A had an absolute requirement for either γ- or δ-hENaC. Transfection of cultured cells originally derived from high grade gliomas (U87-MG and SK-MG1) with ASIC2 abolished basal amiloride-sensitive sodium conductance; this inhibition was reversed by dialysis of the cell interior with Munc-18, a syntaxin-binding protein that typically blocks the interaction of syntaxin with other proteins. Thus, syntaxin 1A cannot inhibit Na+ permeability in the absence of adequate plasma membrane ASIC2 expression, accounting for the observed functional expression of amiloride-sensitive currents in high grade glioma cells.

In patients with malignant gliomas of World Health Organization Grades III and IV, disease progression is uniformly rapid despite aggressive surgical and adjunctive therapies. Median survival of optimally treated individuals with the most aggressive of these tumors, glioblastoma multiforme, is 12 months, and this statistic has not varied for more than 30 years. The ability to treat these tumors successfully has been hampered by a fundamental lack of understanding of the control of the growth and differentiation of glial cells, how the transformed phenotype evolves, and how glioma cells modify their environment to support their increased energy demands. We have identified a novel amiloride-sensitive inward Na+ current that appears to be constitutively activated in malignant gliomas but not in low grade or normal astrocytes (1Bubien J.K. Keeton D.A. Fuller C.M. Gillespie G.Y. Reddy A.T. Mapstone T.B. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1405-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, glioma cells display up-regulation of Cl− and K+ channels not found, at least functionally, in normal glia (2Brismar T. Collins V.P. Brain Res. 1989; 480: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 3Ullrich N. Sontheimer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1511-C1521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that ion transport systems specifically expressed by glioma cells are intimately related to and indeed may define the unique growth and migratory ability of these cells. The main objective of the present study was to explore the molecular mechanisms that underlie the constitutively activated Na+currents present in high grade glioma cells. We assume, based on our previous electrophysiological, pharmacological, and molecular biological studies, that the brain Na+ channels, also known as acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs),1 may comprise the core conduction element of these channels. To date, six members of the ASIC family have been cloned in mammals (4Bassler E.L. Ngo-Anh T.J. Geisler H.S. Ruppersberg J.P Grunder S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33782-33787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These channels share the common property of generating excitatory currents in response to acidic pH when studied in heterologous expression systems, except for ASIC2b that, at least in its homomeric form, does not appear to respond to low pH (5Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R.

Moreover, ASIC4 is inactive by itself and hence is not thought to encode a proton-gated ion channel (6Akopian A.N. Chen C.C. Ding Y. Cesare P. Wood J.N.

Although the subunit composition of brain Na+ channels in native tissues is unknown, evidence for heteromultimeric channel formation with distinctive functional characteristics has been obtained (7Grunder S.

Physiol. 2001; 117: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These brain Na+channels, like their epithelial counterparts, can be inhibited by amiloride and its analogs, although with a much lower affinity (11Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lingueglia E. De Weille J.R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A role for chemical pain sensation has been proposed for these channels in sensory neurons (12Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 13Babinski K. Le K.T. Seguela P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), but their role in the brain is obscure. Proton-activated neuronal currents have been identified in different brain regions (13Babinski K. Le K.T. Seguela P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Chesler M. Kaila K. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 396-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Hence, these channels may function as acid pH sensors in normal brain and in pathophysiological states such as ischemia or epilepsy where tissue acidification occurs (15Biagini G. Babinski K. Avoli M. Marcinkiewicz M. Seguela P. Neurobiol Dis. 2001; 8: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Johnson M.B. Kin K. Minami M. Chen D. Simon R.P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2001; 21: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Gain-of-function mutations of ASIC1 and ASIC2 have also been detected and have been proposed to participate in neurodegenerative disease (7Grunder S. Geisler H.S. Rainier S. Fink J.K. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 9: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,17Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

The function of these channels in glia remains a mystery, yet functional amiloride-sensitive Na+ current expression selectively characterizes high grade gliomas. There are a number of potential mechanisms that may produce a constitutive activation of this class of channel. We tested two hypotheses. First, as a consequence of oncogenic transformation, gain-of-function mutations of ASIC1 may occur. Second, we tested the hypothesis that syntaxin 1A may down-regulate ASIC1 activity by analogy with the effects of syntaxin 1A on other ion channel activities, such as voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, CFTR, and ENaC. Our results show that gain-of-function mutations of ASIC1 are not present in a multitude of freshly resected and cultured high grade gliomas (glioblastoma multiforme or GBM, World Health Organization classification Grade IV). However, syntaxin 1A inhibits ASIC currents, but only when both ASIC1 and ASIC2 are co-expressed. Moreover, the inhibition of ASIC currents by syntaxin 1A requires either γ- or δ-hENaC. Furthermore, message for ASIC2 could be detected in 30–40% of high grade gliomas. We suggest that it is the failure of syntaxin 1A to inhibit ASIC1 activity in the absence of plasma membrane-localized ASIC2 that accounts for the functional expression of amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents in astrocytoma cells. The cDNAs encoding full-length γ-ENaC subunits, ASIC1, and ASIC2 are described elsewhere (19McDonald F.J. Snyder P.M. McCray Jr., P.B. Welsh M.J. Am. J.

David Corey and Jaime Garcia-Añoveros of the Harvard Medical School. The human ENaC subunits were given to us by Dr. Michael J. Welsh of the University of Iowa. cDNAs were transcribed and translated in vitro using the TNT transcription/translation system (Promega) as previously described (22Jovov B. Tousson A. Ji H.L.

To test for protein-protein interaction between different ENaC subunits and syntaxin 1A or between ASIC1 and ASIC2, we translated these constructs either with radioactive or nonradioactive methionine, immunopurified them, and reconstituted them in different combinations in proteoliposomes as previously described (22Jovov B.

Proteoliposomes were solubilized in precipitation buffer that contained 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. All of the precipitation reactions were carried out in this buffer. As a rule, antibodies directed against nonlabeled proteins were used, and the presence of co-precipitated radioactively labeled proteins were detected using SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. DNA samples werein vitro transcribed using the SP6 or T3mMessage Machine kits (Ambion, Austin, TX). The integrity of the cRNA was assessed by running the samples under denaturing conditions on a formaldehyde-agarose gel. RNA concentration and purity were determined by UV spectrophotometry at 260 nm. The oocytes were removed from appropriately anesthetized adult female Xenopus laevis (Xenopus Express, Beverly Hills, FL) using standard techniques (23Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

Defolliculated oocytes were washed in OR-2 medium (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5.0 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and allowed to recover overnight in half-strength Liebovitz medium at 18 °C. Groups of stage VI oocytes were injected with cRNA in a 50-nl volume containing 12.5 ng of ASIC and/or ENaC subunits depending upon the experiments. Standard two-electrode voltage clamp procedures were performed at room temperature on the oocytes 24–72 h post-injection. The oocytes were impaled with two 3 m KCl-filled electrodes, each having resistances of 0.5–2 MΩ. A Dagan TEV-200 voltage clamp amplifier was used. Two Ag-AgCl reference electrodes were connected to the bath by 3 m KCl, 3% agar bridges. The regular perfused solution was ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2 mm KCl, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). To prepare ND96 having pH values below 6.0, MES replaced HEPES. To permit ASIC to recover completely from desensitization following acidification, at least 45 s elapsed prior to a subsequent challenge of the oocyte with another acidic pH solution. The experiments were controlled by pCLAMP 8.0 software (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA), and the proton-sensitive currents measured at −60 mV were digitized. The current-voltage (I-V) relationships were determined by changing the clamp potential in 20-mV increments from −100 to +100 mV from a holding potential of 0 mV. All of the animal care and experimental protocols were approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol number APN 020506241). Planar lipid bilayers were formed from a solution of a 2:1 diphytanoyl-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine:diphytanoyl-phosphatidylserine dissolved in n-octanol (total concentration, 25 mg/ml). The membranes were spread onto a 200-μm diameter hole drilled in a polystyrene cup. Membrane capacitance averaged 250–350 picofarads. The standard bathing solution was 100 mmNaCl plus 10 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.4. The lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All of the solutions were filtered sterilized using 0.22-μm Sterivex-GS filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Electrical connections and current measurements were made as previously described (24Ismailov I.I. Shlyonsky V.G. Alvarez O. Benos D.J. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The voltage was applied to the cis chamber, and the trans chamber was held at virtual ground. Oocyte membrane vesicles containing the channels of interest were applied to a preformed bilayer with a glass rod from the trans compartment with the potential held at −40 mV. Only membranes containing a single ion channel were used for experiments. The data were analyzed as before (24Ismailov I.I. Shlyonsky V.G. Alvarez O. Benos D.J. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Micropipettes were constructed using a Narashigi pp-83 two-stage micropipette puller. The tips of these pipettes had internal diameters of ∼0.3–0.5 μm and outer diameters of 0.7–0.9 μm. When filled with an electrolyte solution containing 100 mm potassium gluconate, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, <10 nm free Ca2+, 4 mm ATP at a pH of 7.2, the electrical resistance of the tip was 1–3 mΩ. The bath solution was serum-free RPMI 1640 cell culture medium. The solutions approximate the ionic gradients across the cell membranein vivo. The pipettes were mounted in a holder and connected to the head stage of an Axon 200A patch clamp amplifier affixed to a three-dimensional micromanipulator system attached to the microscope. The cells were viewed using a Nikon model TE200 inverted microscope fitted with an ultraviolet light source. Under fluorescence, transfected cells expressing jellyfish green fluorescence protein were identified for whole cell patch clamp analysis. The micropipettes were abutted to the cells, and slight suction was applied. Seal resistance was continuously monitored using pCLAMP 8. After the formation of seals with resistances in excess of 1 GΩ, another suction pulse was applied to form the whole cell configuration by rupturing the membrane within the seal but leaving the seal intact. Successful completion of this procedure produced a sudden increase in capacitance with no change in seal resistance, indicative of the whole cell configuration. The cells were then held at a membrane potential of 0 mV and clamped sequentially for 1600 ms each to membrane potentials of −100 mV to +100 mV in 20-mV increments, returning to the holding potential of 0 mV for 1 s between each test voltage. The currents were recorded digitally and filed in real time. The entire procedure was performed using a DOS Pentium computer modified for A/D signals with pCLAMP 8 software and with an A/D interface controlled by pCLAMP (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA). The anti-ASIC2a antibodies (Alamone, Jerusalem, Israel), anti-ASIC1 antibodies (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), anti-γENaC antibodies (raised against peptide; CNTLRLDRAFSSQLTDTQLTNEL), and anti-syntaxin 1A antibodies (25Naren A.P.

Nature. 1997; 390: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blot detection. Crude membrane fractions from the glioblastoma cell line SK-MG1 were prepared as previously described (26Jovov B. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M. Sorscher E.J. Dedman J.R. Kaetzel M.A. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29194-29200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and co-precipitation from SK-MG1 cell lysate were performed using the size X protein A immunoprecipitation kit from Pierce according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, affinity-purified ASIC2 antibody (280 μg) was bound and cross-linked to protein A beads. After extensive washing, the beads were added to the SK-MG1 cell lysates (1.5 ml) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The cells were lysed with 1.5 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted and analyzed by electrophoresis and Western blotting. Standard electrophoresis and blotting protocols were followed. Briefly, the protein was run on 8% SDS-PAGE mini gels with 4% stacking gels for about 1 h at 200 V in a Bio-Rad Minisubcell apparatus. The gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride, treated with 5% nonfat dry milk/Tris-buffered saline/Tween, and probed with the appropriate antibodies. Secondary antibody was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and visualization was performed with chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Controls included substitution of nonimmune rabbit IgG for primary antibodies. To determine whether expression of hASIC2 could restore the normal astrocyte Na+ current phenotype to astrocytoma cells, we transfected hASIC2 contained in a eukaryotic expression vector (GW1-CMV, the kind gift of Dr. David Corey, Massachusetts General Hospital) into the SK-MG1 (gift of Dr. Gregory Cairncross, University of Calgary) or U87-MG (purchased from ATCC) astrocytoma cell lines using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) for whole cell patch-clamp analysis. Briefly, 5–10 μg of hASIC2 was mixed with 100 μl of serum-free Optimem (Invitrogen). In most experiments, hASIC2 was co-transfected with 3 μg of a green fluorescence protein reporter vector. Control cells were either untransfected or transfected with GW1-CMV vector from which the hASIC2 insert had been removed by cutting with EcoRI and religating the cut ends. The DNA/Optimem mixture was mixed with 100 μl of Optimem plus 7.5 μl of lipid and incubated at room temperature for 45 min, after which time a further 800 μl of Optimem was added. Tumor cells plated onto glass coverslips at 60–80% confluency were rinsed twice in Optimem and then incubated for 6 h in the DNA/lipid Optimem mixture. At the end of this incubation period, the medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were allowed to recover overnight and were used for patch-clamp experiments over the course of the next 48 h. Defined regions of syntaxin 1A and syntaxin 3 (amino acids 1–266; referred to as ΔC as they lack the C-terminal membrane anchor) were generated by polymerase chain reaction. Restriction sites (EcoRI in forward and XhoI in reverse), 5′overhangs (TATA), and a stop codon were introduced into the primers. The PCR product was cloned into pGEX5X-1 vector (Pharmacia Corp.) and transformed in a protease deficient Escherichia coli strain (BL21-DE3). The GST fusion protein (GST-Syn1AΔC and GST-Syn3ΔC) was purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Corp.). The protein was eluted using 20 mm reduced glutathione in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and dialyzed extensively at 4 °C with at least four changes of cold phosphate-buffered saline. The protein was concentrated using a centrifugal filter device (Centriprep; 10,000 Dalton cut-off; Millipore). The protein was estimated using the BCA kit (Pierce) and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. Freshly excised human brain tissue or primary cultured brain tumor cells (GBM or normal brain from temporal lobe) were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Neurosurgery Brain Tissue Bank under Institutional Review Board approval X9804090300. The frozen tissue was ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle, under liquid nitrogen, after which 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen) containing 250 μg of glycogen was added. The Trizol/powder mixture was transferred to a chilled glass/Teflon homogenizer and ground for 10 strokes while on ice. The homogenate was sequentially passed through 25- and 26-gauge needles to further reduce cellular debris and then transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. 200 μl of chloroform was added to the homogenate, vortexed for 30 s to mix, and centrifuged at maximum speed (14,000 rpm) for 5 min using a tabletop centrifuge at room temperature. The aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh 1.5-ml tube, 500 μl of ice-cold isopropanol were added, and the RNA was allowed to precipitate overnight at −20 °C. The precipitated RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at maximal speed for 15 min at room temperature, washed with 1 ml of 70% ethanol, and centrifuged for 5 min. The pellet was dissolved in 100 μl of RNase-free H2O, and 100 μl of phenol:chloroform (1:1) was added and mixed by vortexing. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh 1.5-ml tube, and 100 μl of chloroform was added, mixed by vortexing, and centrifuged. After transferring the aqueous phase to a fresh 1.5-ml tube, 10 μl of 7.5 mg/ml ammonium acetate and 250 μl of 100% ethanol were added and mixed well, and the RNA was allowed to precipitate overnight at −20 °C. The precipitated RNA was pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in RNase-free H2O. The integrity of the RNA was verified following electrophoresis through 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels. All of the equipment (e.g.homogenizers, mortar, pestle, etc.) were pretreated with RNase-Zap (Ambion) and rinsed with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O prior to use. All of the human tissue acquisition and protocols were reviewed and approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Review Board (protocol numbers X021015002 and X980409003). RT-PCR was performed using a OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using 0.1–1 μg of total RNA as template. Custom primers specific to ASIC1 were synthesized by Invitrogen and used at a final concentration of 0.6 μm. For example, the forward and reverse primers 5′-CCCGCATGGCAAAGAG-3′ and 5′-GGCTCAGCAGGTAAAGTCC-3′ corresponded to bases 1109–1125 and 1572–1587 (plus 3 bases of the 3′-untranslated region) of ASIC1, respectively. Reverse transcription was performed using a single cycle of 50 °C for 30 min. This was followed by a single cycle of 95 °C for 15 min, which inactivates the reverse transcriptase while activating the HotStart Taq DNA polymerase, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, and finally a single 10-min cycle at 72 °C. Aliquots of each reaction mixture were electrophoresed on a 2% Nu-Sieve (FMC Corp.) agarose gel using PCR markers (Promega) to determine molecular size. Products of the correct molecular size were isolated from the gel using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and subcloned into the pCR-2.1 vector using the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinants were selected by blue/white screening and restricted withEcoRI (Promega) to verify incorporation of insert of correct size. ASIC1 sequences were verified by further restriction enzyme digest analysis and automated DNA sequencing (DNA Sequencing Facility, Iowa State University). We previously reported that there was an amiloride-sensitive component to whole cell inward currents in high grade, highly invasive brain tumors (1Bubien J.K. Keeton D.A. Fuller C.M. Gillespie G.Y. Reddy A.T. Mapstone T.B. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1405-C1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These currents were seen in primary cultures of tumors as well as in established glioma cell lines. This amiloride-sensitive current was not present in low grade brain tumors or normal brain tissue. To verify these initial findings and to extend these results to freshly resected GBM tumors, we performed whole cell patch-clamp experiments on freshly excised normal astrocytes and freshly resected and primary cultured brain tumor tissue samples (Fig.1). In the basal state, the current records for both freshly resected and primary cultures of World Health Organization Grade III and IV tumor cells were characterized by large inward currents (Fig. 1A), and these results were completely inhibited following superfusion with 100 μm amiloride (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C shows the difference current (i.e. the amiloride-sensitive component). These results should be contrasted to the lack of effect of 100 μmamiloride in normal astrocytes and Grades I and II astrocytoma cells. The absolute magnitudes of the outward currents at +40 mV (Fig.2A) and inward currents at −60 mV (Fig.2B) in the absence and presence of amiloride for normal astrocytes, different grade gliomas, medulloblastoma, and two continuous GBM cell lines are summarized in Fig.2. Although there was no discernible pattern to the magnitudes of either the outward or inward currents, amiloride only blocked inward currents in the more aggressive, higher grade tumors (Grades III and IV and medulloblastoma). Amiloride likewise blocked inward currents in SK-MG and U87-MG cells, both originally derived from GBM. A summary of the current-voltage (I–V) characteristics of both freshly resected normal astrocytes and GBM cells is presented in Fig. 3. It is apparent that the GBM cells are depolarized by an average of 31 mV compared with normal astrocytes under these recording conditions. The depolarized zero current membrane potential is due to the presence of an enhanced Na+ conductance. These results confirm our previous findings and establish that this amiloride-inhibitable component to whole cell currents is present in freshly excised GBM cells.Figure 2Summary of absolute outward (+40 mV;A) and inward (−60 mV; B) currents obtained from a variety of gliomas and normal cells in the absence and presence of 100 μm amiloride, using whole cell patch clamp.

https://openalex.org/W2004379183,"The maturation of cell surface receptors through the secretory pathway often requires chaperones that aid in protein folding and trafficking from one organelle to another. Here we describe boca, an evolutionarily conserved gene in Drosophila melanogaster, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum protein that is specifically required for the intracellular trafficking of members of the low-density lipoprotein family of receptors (LDLRs). Two LDLRs in flies, Arrow, which is required for Wingless signal transduction, and Yolkless, which is required for yolk protein uptake during oogenesis, both require boca function. Consequently, boca is an essential component of the Wingless pathway but is more generally required for the activities of multiple LDL receptor family members."

J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The most severe hereditary disorder is the congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type, caused by mutations inNPHS1,1 the gene encoding for nephrin. Nephrin is an integral membrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily located at opposing sites of the secondary foot processes formed by podocytes, specialized epithelial cells that ensure size- and charge-selective ultrafiltration (for reviews, see Refs. 2Tryggvason K. Wartiovaara J. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2001; 10: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar and 3Tryggvason K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2440-2445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise function of nephrin is unknown; however, nephrin is a critical structural component of the slit diaphragm, an ultrathin zipper-like structure that bridges the ∼40-nm-wide slit between interdigitating podocyte foot processes. We have recently shown that nephrin is a signaling protein and that signal transduction can be augmented by another podocyte protein called podocin (4Huber T.B. Kottgen M. Schilling B. Walz G.

Neph1 contains five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and is structurally related to nephrin. It is abundantly expressed in the kidney, and disruption of the Neph1 gene in mice results in effacement of glomerular podocytes, heavy proteinuria, and early postnatal death (11Donoviel D.B. Freed D.D. Vogel H. Potter D.G. Hawkins E. Barrish J.P. Mathur B.N. Turner C.A. Geske R. Montgomery C.A. Starbuck M. Brandt M. Gupta A. Ramirez-Solis R. Zambrowicz B.P. Powell D.R. Mol. Cell.

Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), suggests that the protein complex at the slit diaphragm is highly dynamic and regulated by protein-protein interactions that organize the filtration barrier and initiate intracellular signaling. Although many of the key components of the slit diaphragm have now been identified, the fundamental question remains how the different components are organized at this specialized cell-cell junction.Zonula occludens (ZO) proteins are membrane-associated multidomain proteins usually localized at sites of intercellular junctions. They contain three PDZ domains, a SH3 domain, and a guanylate kinase domain (14Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are protein-binding modules that recognize short peptide motifs within their protein targets (15Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). In almost all cases the last three to five residues at the extreme carboxyl terminus of a transmembrane protein represent the target sequences. Genetic evidence from invertebrate systems demonstrates a role for ZO proteins in facilitating signal transduction, and evidence from vertebrate systems demonstrates a structural role in organizing transmembrane protein complexes (16Mitic L.L. Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G250-G254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fanning A.S. Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1337-1345PubMed Google Scholar). In podocytes, ZO-1 has been shown to specifically localize to the cytoplasmic surface of the slit diaphragms (18Schnabel E. Anderson J.M. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 19Kawachi H. Kurihara H. Topham P.S. Brown D. Shia M.A. Orikasa M. Shimizu F. Salant D.J. Am. J.

However, the function of ZO-1 at the slit and its binding partners have not been characterized.We demonstrate now that ZO-1 specifically binds to the carboxyl terminus of Neph1. Neph1 and ZO-1 are co-localized in the kidney glomerulus. Interaction of ZO-1 with Neph1 alters the ability of Neph1 to stimulate signaling. Our findings suggest that the multiadapter protein ZO-1 serves as a scaffold for the organization of Neph1 molecules and/or provides a platform for the recruitment of signal transduction components to the dynamic protein complex at the slit.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRecent genetic studies of human hereditary disease and genetically modified animals have led to the identification of new podocyte proteins and have highlighted the crucial role of proteins at the filtration slit for the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier (23Antignac C. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown how these different protein components of the slit diaphragm are organized. Since the carboxyl-terminal tail of Neph1 contains a putative class 1 PDZ domain binding motif (scansite.mit.edu, (24Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar)), we speculated that this motif could mediate interaction with PDZ domain proteins. ZO-1 has been the only PDZ domain protein demonstrated to localize to the cytoplasmic surface of the filtration slit. We therefore tested whether ZO-1 interacts with Neph1. Fig. 1A shows that Neph1 specifically co-immunoprecipitated with ZO-1. No interaction could be demonstrated for FAT, another slit diaphragm transmembrane protein containing a putative PDZ domain binding motif (Fig. 1E) (9Inoue T. Yaoita E. Kurihara H. Shimizu F. Sakai T. Kobayashi T. Ohshiro K. Kawachi H. Okada H. Suzuki H. Kihara I. Yamamoto T. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 1003-1012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Binding of Neph1 could be localized to the first 503 amino acids of ZO-1, a region containing the three PDZ domains of ZO-1 (Fig. 1, B and D) and the cytoplasmic tail of Neph1 (Fig. 1C). FLAG-tagged ZO-1-(1–503) appeared as a double band suggesting premature termination or post-translational modification of this construct. The interaction was verified for endogenous proteins from adult mouse kidney, demonstrating that this interaction occurs in vivo(Fig. 1F). Since slit diaphragm proteins are partially Triton X-100-insoluble in vivo, a special CHAPS-containing buffer was used to solubilize the glomeruli. Confirming the biochemical data, ZO-1 and Neph1 co-localized in the glomeruli of the native kidney (Fig. 1G). In addition to the SH3 domain and a guanylate kinase domain the multiadapter protein ZO-1 contains three PDZ domains. These PDZ domains are located within the first 503 amino acids, the region that confers binding to Neph1. We tested therefore which PDZ domain mediated the interaction with Neph1. Pull-down experiments revealed that the interaction specifically involved the first PDZ domain of ZO-1 (Fig. 2A). Deletion of the last three amino acids of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of Neph1 (Thr-His-Val) completely abrogated binding (Fig. 2D). Interestingly mutation of the critical threonine at the −2 position of the PDZ domain binding motif to glutamate disrupted binding to ZO-1 (Fig. 2C). Since threonine-to-glutamate mutation may mimic phosphorylation of the threonine, this finding suggests that phosphorylation of the threonine at the −2 position regulates the interaction between ZO-1 and Neph1 as has been reported for other PDZ-dependent interactions (25Cao T.T.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5791-5796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis needs further clarification. The PDZ binding motif is highly conserved in all currently known Neph proteins (Fig. 2B), and as demonstrated in Fig. 2E, all Nephs bind to ZO-1 in transiently transfected HEK 293T cells; all interactions were mediated by the first PDZ domain of ZO-1 (data not shown). These data suggest that ZO-1 binding may be a general mechanism in the regulation of Neph proteins.Figure 2The first PDZ domain of ZO-1 interacts with aPDZ domain binding motif conserved in all Neph family members. A, lysates of HEK 293T cells transfected with Neph1 cDNA were subjected to a pull-down assay with recombinant affinity-purified PDZ domains of ZO-1 fused to GST. Neph1 specifically interacted with the first PDZ domain of ZO-1. The lower panel shows equal expression levels of GST fusion proteins on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel. B, the PDZ domain binding motif is highly conserved among all Neph family members. Shown is the alignment of the last 18 amino acids of Neph1–3. Identical residues are highlighted (yellow). The PDZ domain binding motif is shown inred. C and D, mutation of the threonine at the −2 position in the PDZ domain binding motif of Neph1 to glutamate (T787E) (C) or deletion of the last three amino acids of Neph1 (D) abrogates binding of ZO-1. HEK 293T cells were transfected with the expression plasmids as indicated. Lysates were precipitated with protein G, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for ZO-1 with an anti-FLAG antibody (M2). E, all Neph family members interact with ZO-1 in HEK 293T cells. Lysates of cells transfected with the plasmid DNA as indicated were precipitated with protein G. ZO-1 was detected with the M2 anti-FLAG antiserum. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)It has been shown that ZO-1 may organize signal transduction, and multiple evidences demonstrate a structural role in organizing transmembrane protein complexes (16Mitic L.L. Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G250-G254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined therefore whether ZO-1 expression modulates Neph1 signaling in HEK 293T cells. HEK 293T cells contain only very low levels of ZO-1 and Neph1 and represent an ideal model system to examine ZO-1 effects on Neph1 signaling. AP-1 activity, measured by luciferase assays, is a very sensitive parameter for the activation of several pathways including the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling cascades. Since ZO-1 can recruit signal transduction components including G proteins and kinases to cell-cell contacts and may interact with a variety of additional signal transduction components including Fyn, Grb-2, Crk, or glycogen synthase kinase-3β (scansite.mit.edu/), we analyzed the effect of ZO-1 on Neph1-mediated AP-1 activation (Fig.3A). Co-expression of ZO-1 significantly accelerated the Neph1-mediated AP-1 activity, whereas ZO-1 alone had no effect (Fig. 3A). Augmentation of Neph1 signaling by ZO-1 requires direct binding of Neph1. Neph1-induced AP-1 activity was not modulated by ZO-1 after deletion of the PDZ binding motif in Neph1 or mutation of ZO-1 (data not shown). We have previously shown that the cytoplasmic tail of Neph1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated (12Sellin L. Huber T.B. Gerke P. Quack I. Pavenstadt H. Walz G. FASEB J. 2002; 17: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Interestingly ZO-1 co-expression strongly augmented tyrosine phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus of Neph1 (Fig. 3,B–F) but did not influence tyrosine phosphorylation of Neph1 T787E, a mutant that fails to interact with ZO-1 (data not shown). Of note, ZO-1 did not only enhance tyrosine phosphorylation but also augmented serine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of Neph1 as demonstrated by in vivo labeling and phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 3F). These findings suggest that ZO-1 organizes Neph1 complexes and helps to recruit signal transduction components to facilitate Neph1 signaling.Figure 3ZO-1 enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of Neph1 and augments Neph1-mediated AP-1activation. A, HEK 293T cells were transfected with an AP-1-dependent luciferase construct and expression plasmids as indicated. Neph1 stimulated an ∼4-fold increase in AP-1 activity, whereas ZO-1 expression had no effect. ZO-1 co-expression strongly augmented the Neph1-induced AP-1 activity (*, p < 0.05; n = 3) but was without effect on the Neph1 expression level (lower panel). ZO-1 did not augment the AP-1 activation of the Neph1 mutant (T787E) lacking the ZO-1 interaction site. B, ZO-1 enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus of Neph1. HEK 293T cells were transfected with the plasmids as indicated. Neph1 was precipitated, and precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, left panel) followed by anti-human IgG antiserum to confirm equal expression levels (right panel). C, densitometric analysis of non-saturated radiographs using the NIH Image software (**, p< 0.01, n = 6). D, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of Neph1 precipitates reveals that the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of Neph1 is not a result of overlap from co-precipitating proteins but can be attributed to Neph1 itself. E and F, in vivolabeling with 32P and phosphoamino acid analysis reveal that increased phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated Neph1 in the presence of ZO-1 (E) is a result of strongly augmented tyrosine phosphorylation and serine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of Neph1 (F, phosphoamino acid analysis).IEF, isoelectric focusing; WT, wild type;WB, Western blot; PY, phosphotyrosine;w/o, without.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Recent work has highlighted the exquisite role of the slit diaphragm for the integrity of the glomerular filter (1Kerjaschki D.

However, until now it is not clear how these different components are organized at the filtration slit. Our results suggest that the PDZ domain-containing multiadapter protein ZO-1 may help to cluster the transmembrane protein Neph1. This conclusion is based on two observations. First, ZO-1 specifically interacts with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of Neph1. This interaction, mediated by the first PDZ domain of ZO-1, was present in vivo and may be dynamically regulated by phosphorylation. Second, direct binding of ZO-1 to the carboxyl terminus of Neph1 dramatically alters the phosphorylation state of Neph1 and the ability to induce signal transduction. It is well established that PDZ domain proteins act as scaffolds for signaling complexes and serve to recruit signal transduction components (14Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 34Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ZO-1 has been shown to regulate signaling involved in the control of cell polarity, the tightness of the paracellular seal, and transcriptional responses (35Balda M.S. Matter K. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 36Balda M.S. Matter K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2024-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Our findings extend the function of ZO-1 and suggest that ZO-1 is involved in the regulation of signaling by slit diaphragm proteins. It has been suggested that ZO-1 in addition to its signaling function interacts with the actin cytoskeleton and components of the paracellular seal (37Fanning A.S. Ma T.Y. Anderson J.M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1835-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Although the functional implications of ZO-1/actin association have not yet been established in vivo ZO-1 could link Neph1 and its associated binding proteins to the actin cytoskeleton and contribute to the organization of the filtration slit. Given the importance of the submembranous actin cytoskeleton for the maintenance of the podocyte architecture (1Kerjaschki D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to evaluate the exact role of ZO-1 for the organization of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton in animal models that selectively target the ZO-1-Neph1 interaction. Hereditary nephrotic syndrome is a heterogeneous disease characterized by heavy proteinuria and renal failure. The recent description of gene defects of the podocyte resulting in hereditary nephrotic syndrome has provided a completely new understanding of the glomerular filter and unraveled important aspects of the pathogenesis of proteinuric kidney diseases (1Kerjaschki D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The most severe hereditary disorder is the congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type, caused by mutations inNPHS1,1 the gene encoding for nephrin. Nephrin is an integral membrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily located at opposing sites of the secondary foot processes formed by podocytes, specialized epithelial cells that ensure size- and charge-selective ultrafiltration (for reviews, see Refs. 2Tryggvason K. Wartiovaara J. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2001; 10: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar and 3Tryggvason K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2440-2445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise function of nephrin is unknown; however, nephrin is a critical structural component of the slit diaphragm, an ultrathin zipper-like structure that bridges the ∼40-nm-wide slit between interdigitating podocyte foot processes. We have recently shown that nephrin is a signaling protein and that signal transduction can be augmented by another podocyte protein called podocin (4Huber T.B. Kottgen M. Schilling B. Walz G. Benzing T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41543-41546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Podocin is a hairpin-like protein at the slit diaphragm encoded by NPHS2, the gene disrupted in a steroid-resistant hereditary nephrotic syndrome (5Fuchshuber A. Jean G. Gribouval O. Gubler M.C.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) have recently been associated with the development of proteinuria. Neph1 contains five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and is structurally related to nephrin. It is abundantly expressed in the kidney, and disruption of the Neph1 gene in mice results in effacement of glomerular podocytes, heavy proteinuria, and early postnatal death (11Donoviel D.B. Freed D.D. Vogel H. Potter D.G. Hawkins E. Barrish J.P. Mathur B.N. Turner C.A. Geske R. Montgomery C.A. Starbuck M. Brandt M. Gupta A. Ramirez-Solis R. Zambrowicz B.P. Powell D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Neph1 belongs to a family of three closely related proteins that bind to podocin (12Sellin L. Huber T.B. Gerke P. Quack I. Pavenstadt H. Walz G. FASEB J. 2002; 17: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The interaction of nephrin with the Src homology 3 (SH3)-containing adaptor protein CD2AP (8Shih N.Y.

Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), suggests that the protein complex at the slit diaphragm is highly dynamic and regulated by protein-protein interactions that organize the filtration barrier and initiate intracellular signaling. Although many of the key components of the slit diaphragm have now been identified, the fundamental question remains how the different components are organized at this specialized cell-cell junction. Zonula occludens (ZO) proteins are membrane-associated multidomain proteins usually localized at sites of intercellular junctions. They contain three PDZ domains, a SH3 domain, and a guanylate kinase domain (14Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are protein-binding modules that recognize short peptide motifs within their protein targets (15Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). In almost all cases the last three to five residues at the extreme carboxyl terminus of a transmembrane protein represent the target sequences. Genetic evidence from invertebrate systems demonstrates a role for ZO proteins in facilitating signal transduction, and evidence from vertebrate systems demonstrates a structural role in organizing transmembrane protein complexes (16Mitic L.L.

It was shown that at a low YB-1/mRNA ratio YB-1 promoted translation at the stage of initiation (30Evdokimova V.M. Kovrigina E.A. Nashchekin D.V. Davydova E.K. Hershey J.W. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2911-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In initiation reactions reconstituted in vitro from purified translation components, YB-1 stimulated or inhibited formation of 48 S preinitiation complex depending on its amount bound to mRNA (34Pisarev A.V. Skabkin M.A. Thomas A.A. Merrick W.C. Ovchinnikov L.P. Shatsky I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15445-15451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It was also shown that inhibitory concentrations of YB-1 suppressed the interaction of eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4B with the mRNA cap structure (16Evdokimova V. Ruzanov P. Imataka H. Raught B. Svitkin Y. Ovchinnikov L.P. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5491-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Experiments on the effect of separate YB-1 domains on mRNA translation and on interaction of the above initiation factors with mRNA cap structure gave a surprising result: AP-CSD as well as CSD alone displaced eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4B from the mRNA cap structure and increased the stability of mRNA but produced nearly no effect on its translational activity. In contrast, the C-terminal domain of YB-1 strongly inhibited protein synthesis without any effect on interactions of eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4B with the mRNA cap structure (16Evdokimova V. Ruzanov P. Imataka H. Raught B. Svitkin Y. Ovchinnikov L.P. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5491-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Although all these results suggest that YB-1 inhibits protein synthesis at the initiation stage, its effect on elongation and termination of protein synthesis cannot be ruled out. The exact initiation step inhibited by YB-1 cannot be specified. In this study we demonstrate that YB-1 inhibits translation in a cell-free translation system only at the initiation stage, whereas elongation and termination of protein synthesis remain unaffected. YB-1 causes accumulation of intact, translationally competent mRNA in the form of free mRNPs. The full-length YB-1 as well as its inhibitory C-terminal domain displaces eIF4G from the mRNA, thereby causing an arrest of translation. Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). YB-1 and its truncated fragments were purified as described previously (16Evdokimova V. Ruzanov P. Imataka H. Raught B. Svitkin Y. Ovchinnikov L.P. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5491-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). All purified proteins were dialyzed against 150 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, and stored at −70 °C in aliquots. Protein concentrations were determined by staining using a Micro BCA kit (Pierce). Rabbit reticulocyte eIF4F was a gift from Dr. I. Shatsky (Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia). Rabbit anti-eIF4G antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. R. Rhoads (Louisiana State University, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology). Globin mRNA was obtained from polysomes of rabbit reticulocytes as described previously (35Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5183) Google Scholar). The ribosomal pellet was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS with subsequent phenol/chloroform extraction followed by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. 9 S globin mRNA was isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The cell-free translation system derived from rabbit reticulocytes was described previously (30Evdokimova V.M. Kovrigina E.A. Nashchekin D.V. Davydova E.K. Hershey J.W. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3574-3581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mixtures (15 μl) contained 7.5 μl of reticulocyte lysate, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KOAc, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2, 8 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.2 mm GTP, 0.8 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, a 25 μm concentration of each amino acid (except for the labeled ones), and 0.6 μCi of [14C]Leu (>300 mCi/mmol; Radioisotop, Obninsk, Russia) or 1 μCi of [35S]Met (>700 Ci/mmol; Radioisotop). When micrococcal nuclease-treated lysates were used, the mixture was supplemented with mRNA as indicated in the figure legends. For ribosome transit time measurements, the volume of the translation mixtures was increased up to 150 μl, and 25-μl aliquots were taken at the indicated times, diluted with 125 μl of ice-cold stop buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm cycloheximide (Sigma), and immediately placed on ice. The mixtures were layered onto a 30% glycerol cushion with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged at 100,000 rpm in a TLA-100.3 rotor (Beckman) for 40 min. The supernatant fraction and ribosomal pellet dissolved in 1% SDS were assayed for trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity. The globin mRNA-eIF4F complex was assembled as described previously (36Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Shatsky I.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6859-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) by incubating mRNA (23 pmol) with eIF4F (4 pmol) for 15 min at 30 °C in buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 2.5 mmMg(OAc)2, 100 mm KOAc, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μm spermidine, and 25 units of RNasin (Promega). YB-1 was added to the incubation mixture as indicated in the figure legends. The samples were ice-cooled and analyzed by sedimentation in sucrose gradients. Cell-free translation mixtures (60 μl) were layered onto 15–30% or 15–40% (w/v) linear sucrose gradients made in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2. Centrifugation was carried out at 45,000 rpm in an SW-60 rotor (Beckman) for the times indicated. The mRNA-eIF4F complexes were resolved by centrifugation through 5–20% (w/v) linear sucrose gradients in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mmMg(OAc)2, 100 mm KOAc at 45,000 rpm for 5.5 h in a SW-60 rotor. All gradients were monitored for absorbance at 254 nm during their collection from the bottom. Fractions of 260 μl were diluted with 700 μl of ice-cold water and measured for [14C]Leu incorporation into protein. For Northern hybridization, sucrose gradient fractions were supplemented with 1% SDS and deproteinized with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform. Total RNA was either filtered directly onto nitrocellulose membrane Hybond-N (Amersham Biosciences) or first separated by a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and then transferred onto the membrane. The membranes were hybridized with randomly primed 32P-labeled α-globin cDNA. For quantitation of hybridized RNA, each dot was excised, and radioactivity was measured by Cherenkov radiation in a Beckman LS-100C scintillation counter. For Western blot analysis of the eIF4F and YB-1 distribution, proteins were precipitated from sucrose gradient fractions by trichloroacetic acid (5% final concentration), resolved by SDS-15% PAGE, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman). The membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.05% Tween 20 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl and probed with anti-eIF4G (1:500) or anti-YB-1 (1:5000 dilution) polyclonal antibodies. Immunocomplexes were detected using alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The effect of the recombinant YB-1 on translation of endogenous and exogenous globin mRNA in the rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system was assayed. In both cases, increasing amounts of YB-1 caused the complete inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 1) that was observed after addition of 3 μg (80 pmol) of YB-1. In the cell-free system with 0.3 μg (1.4 pmol) of exogenous mRNA this provides a YB-1/mRNA mass ratio of about 10 and a molar ratio of about 60. This ratio far exceeds that in free mRNPs (mass ratio of about 3), and the amount of added exogenous YB-1 is ∼6 times higher than the amount of endogenous YB-1 in reticulocyte lysates. To inhibit a system with more exogenous mRNA, a larger amount of YB-1 is required (29Minich W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A comparatively large amount of YB-1, required to perform the complete inhibition of translation, can be explained by titrating out part of YB-1 as a result of its nonspecific interaction with tRNA (32Svitkin Y.V. Ovchinnikov L.P. Dreyfuss G. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7147-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and with ribosomal subunits (see Fig. 5). FRGY2, the Xenopusembryonic homolog of YB-1, was reported to be detected not only in mRNPs but also in 15 S complexes with nucleolin and with some other unidentified polypeptides (37Yurkova M.S. Murray M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10870-10876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The amount of YB-1 that we used to inhibit translation in the cell-free system is likely to be present in the cell under some conditions. For example, the amount of Y-box proteins increases significantly in cancer cells (38Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4224-4228PubMed Google Scholar, 39Shibao K. Takano H. Nakayama Y. Okazaki K. Nagata N. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Itoh H. Int. J.

Samples were ice-cooled and subjected to 15–40% (A and B) or 15–30% (C–H) linear sucrose gradient centrifugation for 55 min (A and B) or 2 h and 45 min (C–H) at 45,000 rpm in an SW-60 rotor. UV absorbance profiles at 254 nm (—) and 32P radioactivity (●) are shown. The distribution of eIF4G and YB-1, as determined by Western blot, is shown in upper insets. For YB-1 bands inB and D, the reaction time was reduced to avoid overexposure in the presence of 6-fold exogenous YB-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To monitor the biological and physical state of mRNA in a cell-free translation system inhibited by YB-1, RNA was isolated from lysates incubated under cell-free translation conditions in the presence of YB-1. As shown in Fig. 2A, the amount and size of α-globin mRNA (determined by Northern hybridization with32P-labeled α-globin cDNA) did not change as compared with control. RNA preserved its messenger activity in the cell-free translation system (Fig. 2B) and produced full-length globin chains (Fig. 2C). Thus, the YB-1-induced inhibition of protein synthesis is not caused by mRNA decay. The phase of translation affected by an inhibitor can be determined by analyzing the polysome profile and measuring the elongation rate. The run-off of ribosomes from polysomes usually indicates inhibition of initiation, whereas maintenance of or an increase in polysome size suggests inhibition of elongation/termination. We have compared the polysome profiles of reticulocyte lysates incubated in the absence and presence of exogenous YB-1. Incubation of the cell-free system without YB-1 for 5 min did not produce any remarkable change in the polysome profiles (Fig.3, compare A andB). However, incubation with YB-1 resulted in a complete polysomal decay (Fig. 3, compare A and B withC). The process was accompanied by dissociation of the radiolabeled polypeptide chain from the ribosomes, which once again indicates that decay of the major part of polysomes is not a result of mRNA fragmentation by ribonucleases since such cleavage of polysomes produces ribosomes associated with the growing polypeptide. Rather the run-off of ribosomes from polysomes implies that exogenous YB-1 mainly inhibited initiation. The average time of elongation + termination of polypeptide chains (transit time) can be quantitatively determined by measuring the kinetics of radioactive amino acid incorporation into total protein and into completed polypeptides released from the ribosome (42Fan H. Penman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 50: 655-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). We used this technique to determine the effect of YB-1-induced inhibition on the elongation + termination rate. The cell-free translation system was inhibited up to ∼50% since a stronger inhibition would not produce reasonable (measurable) incorporation data. From the results shown in Fig. 4, the transit time for globin synthesis in the control (uninhibited lysate) is 1.3 min. In the experimental system with exogenous YB-1, the same transit time was obtained. Thus, YB-1 did not affect the polypeptide elongation or termination rate and only inhibited translation initiation. To identify the YB-1-inhibited step in the initiation pathway, the cell-free translation systems with endogenous mRNA were incubated for 5 min without YB-1 or with the inhibiting amount of YB-1 (340 pmol of YB-1/60 μl of system), fractionated by centrifugation in sucrose gradients, and analyzed for α-globin mRNA distribution by Northern hybridization with32P-labeled α-globin cDNA. Without YB-1, mRNA was found mainly in the region with a sedimentation coefficient exceeding 80 S, except for a small 20 S peak corresponding to free globin mRNPs (Fig. 5C). After incubation in the presence of YB-1, the major part of α-globin mRNA was found in the region of free globin mRNP sedimentation (∼20 S) (Fig.5D). This is similar to α-globin mRNA distribution after translation inhibition by the cap analogue m7GpppG (Fig.5F), whereas after inhibition with edeine the major part of this mRNA was, as expected (43Kozak M. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6568-6577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a component of the 48 S preinitiation complexes (Fig. 5E). Western blot analysis of YB-1 distribution showed that in the original lysate endogenous YB-1 was widely distributed both in the polysomal and postribosomal sedimentation regions (Fig. 5, A andC), which was consistent with our previous results (31Minich W.B. Volyanik E.V. Korneyeva N.L. Berezin Y.V. Ovchinnikov L.P. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1990; 14: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). After incubation with edeine (Fig. 5E), cap analog (Fig.5F), or exogenous YB-1 (Fig. 5, B andD) nearly all YB-1 sedimented in the postribosomal region with bimodal distribution: partly at 20 S (the region of free mRNPs with globin mRNA) and partly at 60–40 S. The absence of mRNA from the 60–40 S region when the translation is inhibited by the cap analog or YB-1 indicates that in this region YB-1 turns to be associated with ribosomal subunits. There was not a notable difference between YB-1 sedimentation distributions for the YB-1 and cap analog cases (Fig. 5, compare D and F). Interestingly in these two cases the bulk of ribosome dissociated into subunits, which in the edeine case was less pronounced. The mRNA accumulation in the form of free mRNPs in the YB-1-inhibited cell-free system indicated that the protein synthesis inhibition occurred at the stage of mRNA association with the small ribosomal subunit. Since this association was preceded by the small subunit to Met-tRNAi binding, and this subunit, in its turn, interacted with YB-1, the latter interaction might suppress binding of Met-tRNAi to 40 S subunits and prevent formation of the 43 S preinitiation complex. However, a special experiment revealed that addition of YB-1 to the system did not affect the formation of the 43 S preinitiation complex with [35S]Met-tRNAi, and deacylation of this complex was not observed either (data not shown). This suggests that YB-1 inhibited translation either at the stage of mRNA association with 43 S complex or at a preceding stage of mRNA interaction with translation initiation factors. Prior to mRNA interaction with the 43 S preinitiation complex, mRNA binds to eIF4F, eIF4A, and eIF4B (44Hershey J. Merrick W. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). The first phase of this multistep process is ATP-dependent mRNA binding to eIF4F comprising the eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A subunits. The YB-1 effect on interaction of eIF4F with endogenous mRNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysate was assayed. The mRNA-eIF4F complex formation was followed by sedimentational distribution of eIF4G using Western blot with monospecific antibodies to eIF4G. In the control without YB-1 addition (Fig. 5A), a considerable portion of eIF4G sedimented in the region of polysomes. In the presence of edeine, the bulk of eIF4G was observed in the region of sedimentation of the 48 S complex, i.e. the small subunit-associated mRNA retained eIF4G in the presence of edeine (Fig. 5E). Inhibitory amounts of YB-1 causing mRNA accumulation as free mRNPs displaced eIF4G from mRNA completely. As a result, sedimentation of eIF4G was slower than that of free globin-containing mRNPs, that is, slower than 20 S (Fig.5D). The ability of YB-1 to displace eIF4F from mRNA was confirmed by experiments with isolated components of the translation system, eIF4F, mRNA, and YB-1, that were incubated in the presence of ATP. The results are given in Fig. 6. In the absence of mRNA, eIF4F distributed in the upper zone of the sucrose gradient (see Western blots, Fig. 6B); after addition of mRNA in both cap+ or cap− variants, almost all eIF4G (presumably as a constituent of eIF4F) was bound tightly to mRNA and sedimented somewhat faster than free mRNA (Fig. 6, C andH). Addition of YB-1 to the cap+ mRNA-eIF4F complex with a YB-1/mRNA molar ratio ranging from 6 to 36 resulted in an increase of mRNA sedimentation coefficient from 9 S (without YB-1) to 21 S, respectively; then all YB-1 co-sedimented with mRNA. Addition of YB-1 resulted in a nearly complete (at 12:1) or complete (at 36:1) displacement of eIF4G from cap+ mRNA (Fig. 6,D–F). In the case of uncapped mRNA (Fig. 6,G–J), the effect of YB-1 on eIF4G displacement was stronger: we could observe an almost complete displacement of eIF4G at as low a YB-1/mRNA molar ratio as 12:1 (Fig. 6, compareE, F, and J). These results are in good agreement with the finding that translation of uncapped mRNA is more sensitive to YB-1 inhibition (30Evdokimova V.M. Kovrigina E.A. Nashchekin D.V. Davydova E.K. Hershey J.W. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3574-3581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Note that the decay of the eIF4G-mRNA complex results from interactions between YB-1 and mRNA but not between YB-1 and eIF4G because, with eIF4G completely displaced from mRNA, YB-1 co-sediments with mRNA but not with eIF4G (Fig. 6, F and J). YB-1 contains three domains: AP, CSD, and the C-terminal domain with basic and acidic residues. The C-terminal domain of YB-1 behaved in a manner similar to full-length YB-1: after incubation of cell-free translation system with the C-terminal fragment of YB-1, the major part of α-globin mRNA sedimented as free globin mRNPs, just as after addition of full-length YB-1. eIF4G was absent from this part of the gradient, the majority sedimenting as free eIF4F (Fig. 5H). Addition of the AP-CSD part of YB-1 to the system caused neither mRNA transition into the free mRNP region nor eIF4G displacement into the free factor sedimentation region (Fig. 5, compare Gand C). Fig. 7 illustrates the effect of the used YB-1 fragments on protein synthesis in the cell-free system. AP-CSD, which does not displace eIF4G from mRNA, affected translation only slightly even with large amounts of the protein used, whereas the C-terminal fragment dramatically suppressed translation and even exhibited a higher inhibitory activity than the entire YB-1. This is in agreement with previous results reported for YB-1 fragments (16Evdokimova V. Ruzanov P. Imataka H. Raught B. Svitkin Y. Ovchinnikov L.P. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5491-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and for fragments of the homologous protein FRGY2 fromXenopus oocytes (45Matsumoto K. Meric F. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22706-22712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As reported previously and confirmed by the current study, YB-1 inhibits mRNA translation at a high YB-1/mRNA ratio. Here we show that the inhibition is not caused by mRNA degradation or its functional inactivation: there was no difference in size between mRNAs from lysates incubated with or without YB-1, and RNA preparations from these lysates displayed identical translational activities. Translation inhibition by YB-1 was accompanied by a complete decay of polysomes, and hence it occurred mostly or exclusively at the stage of initiation. Since the measured transit time of ribosomes was the same in the experiment with or without YB-1, YB-1 did not affect elongation or termination and inhibited protein synthesis at the stage of initiation only. Elongation was unaffected by YB-1 presumably because the ribosome-covered protein-coding mRNA region is inaccessible to YB-1. Another, still more probable, explanation is that the energy-supplied translating ribosomes can easily displace YB-1 from mRNA. After polysome decay under the action of YB-1, mRNA sedimented as free mRNPs, i.e. YB-1 interfered with the interaction between mRNA and the 43 S preinitiation complex or with the preceding mRNA interaction with translation initiation factors eIF4F, eIF4A, and eIF4B. With model experiments, assembling a 48 S preinitiation complex from purified components, it was shown that inhibition by YB-1 could be overcome by increasing eIF4F concentration (34Pisarev A.V. Skabkin M.A. Thomas A.A. Merrick W.C. Ovchinnikov L.P. Shatsky I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15445-15451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This means that YB-1 blocks the first step in mRNA recruitment into initiation of translation, that is, YB-1 shuts off the interaction of mRNA with eIF4F. In vitro data showed that YB-1 inhibited binding of two eIF4F subunits, eIF4E, and eIF4A as well as the factor eIF4B with the mRNA cap structure (16Evdokimova V. Ruzanov P. Imataka H. Raught B. Svitkin Y. Ovchinnikov L.P. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5491-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Surprisingly CSD and AP-CSD displaced these factors too (16Evdokimova V. Ruzanov P. Imataka H. Raught B. Svitkin Y. Ovchinnikov L.P. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5491-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), although protein synthesis was only inhibited slightly (Ref. 16Evdokimova V. Ruzanov P. Imataka H. Raught B. Svitkin Y. Ovchinnikov L.P. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5491-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar and Fig. 7 of the current paper) in spite of displacement of eIF4E. This can be explained by the fact that in rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation is relatively independent of the presence of this factor (32Svitkin Y.V. Ovchinnikov L.P. Dreyfuss G. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7147-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In other words, binding of the above three factors (eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4B) to the mRNA cap structure is not so crucial for initiation of translation in this system. The C-terminal domain of YB-1 is a strong inhibitor of protein synthesis (Ref. 16Evdokimova V. Ruzanov P. Imataka H. Raught B. Svitkin Y. Ovchinnikov L.P. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5491-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar and Fig. 7 of the current paper), although the interaction of eIF4A, eIF4B, or eIF4E with the cap structure was unaffected by this YB-1 domain (16Evdokimova V. Ruzanov P. Imataka H. Raught B. Svitkin Y. Ovchinnikov L.P. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5491-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This suggested that YB-1 may interfere with eIF4G binding. The current study was focused on verification of this suggestion. We showed that YB-1, as well as its C-terminal domain, displaced eIF4G from mRNA in lysate. In a system with purified components (mRNA, eIF4F, and ATP), the result was the same, pointing to direct competition between eIF4G and YB-1. Thus, YB-1 displaces all subunits of eIF4F from the mRNA. The displacement of eIF4G occurred at a YB-1/mRNA molar ratio of 12–36 (mass ratio 2–6) (Fig. 6), which is close to that in free mRNPs. The higher mass ratio (about 10) required for complete suppression of protein synthesis in lysates (Fig. 1) can possibly be explained by the presence of various YB-1-binding competitors; the major competitors among these are ribosomal subunits. The functional meaning of the interaction between YB-1 and the ribosomal subunits remains to be studied. Taken together, the current and previous results can be presented as an overall diagram of the effect of YB-1 on translation initiation (Fig.8). At a relatively low YB-1/mRNA ratio (Fig. 8A), YB-1 stimulates initiation of translation by associating with mRNA over its entire length, presumably displacing RNA-binding factors from nonspecific binding sites. This may lead to concentration of these factors around the cap structure that is their specific binding site (29Minich W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34Pisarev A.V. Skabkin M.A. Thomas A.A. Merrick W.C. Ovchinnikov L.P. Shatsky I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15445-15451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is also possible that YB-1 additionally facilitates movement of the small ribosomal subunit in complex with initiator Met-tRNA up to the initiation codon by melting the secondary structure of mRNA 5′-untranslated region. This is supported by data on RNA melting activity reported in Refs. 14Evdokimova V.M. Wei C.L. Sitikov A.S. Simonenko P.N. Lazarev O.A. Vasilenko K.S. Ustinov V.A. Hershey J.W. Ovchinnikov L.P. J.

At a higher YB-1/mRNA ratio (Fig. 8B), YB-1 inhibits initiation of translation and stabilizes mRNA as a result of eIF4F displacement from mRNA. The AP-CSD domains displace eIF4E and eIF4A from the cap structure (Fig. 8C), thereby stabilizing mRNA (16Evdokimova V. Ruzanov P. Imataka H. Raught B. Svitkin Y. Ovchinnikov L.P. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5491-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) without significantly affecting its translational activity. The C-terminal domain displaces eIF4G from the mRNA (Fig.8D), thus suppressing initiation of translation. So two different functions of YB-1 are distinctly attributed to its different domains. Translation of uncapped mRNA was inhibited by lower concentrations of YB-1 as compared with translation of capped mRNA (32Svitkin Y.V. Ovchinnikov L.P. Dreyfuss G. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7147-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our results provide a simple explanation for this observation: the YB-1 C-terminal domain easily annihilates binding of eIF4G that is not additionally stabilized by the eIF4G-eIF4E-cap bridge. In cytoplasm in vivo, concentration of YB-1, and hence the YB-1/mRNA ratio, may vary due to both a changing total amount of YB-1 in the cell (38Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4224-4228PubMed Google Scholar, 46Bargou R.C. Jurchott K. Wagener C. Bergmann S. Metzner S. Bommert K. Mapara M.Y. Winzer K.J. Dietel M. Dorken B.

On the other hand, eIF4F competes with YB-1 for binding to mRNA, and an increase of its concentration in the cell may cause displacement of YB-1 from the mRNA 5′-untranslated region and activate initiation of translation. Thus, the translational status and stability of mRNA is determined not only by the YB-1/mRNA ratio but also by the YB-1/eIF4F ratio. We are grateful to Prof. I. Shatsky for kindly providing rabbit eIF4F, Prof. R. Rhoads for anti-eIF4G antibodies, and Dr. P. Ruzanov for plasmids with recombinant YB-1 fragments."

PPARα mediates the hypolipidemic action of the fibrates, whereas PPARγ is a receptor for the antidiabetic glitazones. In the present study, the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A9 enzyme is identified as a PPARα and PPARγ target gene.

Upon ligand activation, PPARα and PPARγ regulate gene transcription by dimerizing with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binding to PPAR response elements (PPREs) within the regulatory regions of target genes (1Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 648-688Google Scholar). These PPREs usually consist of a direct repeat of the hexanucleotide AGGTCA sequence separated by one or two nucleotides (DR1 or DR2) (1Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 648-688Google Scholar). Furthermore, both PPARα and PPARγ negatively interfere with proinflammatory transcription factors pathways by a mechanism termed transrepression (2Delerive P. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 169: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). PPARα is highly expressed in tissues such as liver, muscle, kidney, and heart, where it stimulates the β-oxidative degradation of fatty acids (3Pineda Torra I. Chinetti G. Duval C. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). PPARγ is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, where it promotes adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage (4Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar).

Natural eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid via the lipoxygenase pathway, such as 8-hydroxytetraenoic acid (8-HETE), 15-HETE, and leukotriene B4, as well as oxidized phospholipids activate PPARα (7Willson T.M.

PPARγ is a receptor for eicosanoid metabolites formed via the cyclooxygenase (15d-prostaglandin J2) and lipoxygenase pathways (15-HETE, 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (9-HODE), and 13-HODE) (10Barbier O.

Synthetic agonists of PPARs are used in the treatment of metabolic diseases, such as dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes. The antidiabetic glitazones (e.g. troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone), which are insulin sensitizers, are high affinity ligands for PPARγ (7Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). The hypolipidemic fibrates (gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, and fenofibrate) are PPARα ligands (7Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). Both natural and synthetic ligands of PPARs share similar metabolic pathways, since eicosanoids, fibrates, and troglitazone are excreted as glucuronide conjugates in humans (11Loi C.M. Young M. Randinitis E. Vassos A. Koup J.R. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1999; 37: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Liu H.F. Vincent-Viry M. Galteau M.M. Gueguen R. Magdalou J. Nicolas A. Leroy P.

Glucuronides are naturally occurring conjugation metabolites of xenobiotics and endobiotics (15Dutton G.J. Glucuronidation of Drugs and Other Compounds. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1980Google Scholar). Glucuronide conjugation (or glucuronidation), the process underlying their formation, is considered detoxifying, because glucuronides usually possess less intrinsic biological or chemical activity than their parent aglycones and are rapidly excreted. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes catalyze the glucuronidation reaction, which consists of the addition of the glycosyl group from a nucleotide sugar (UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA)) to a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds (15Dutton G.J. Glucuronidation of Drugs and Other Compounds. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1980Google Scholar). Endogenous glucuronidated substances are, for instance, androgens, estrogens, progestins, bile acids, fatty acids, retinoids, and bilirubin (16King C.D. Rios G.R. Green M.D. Tephly T.R. Curr. Drug Metab. 2000; 1: 143-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Numerous exogenous compounds are glucuronidated by UGTs, including environmental compounds, plant steroids, and important pharmacological agents (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, or fibrates) (11Loi C.M. Young M. Randinitis E. Vassos A. Koup J.R. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1999; 37: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16King C.D. Rios G.R. Green M.D. Tephly T.R. Curr. Drug Metab. 2000; 1: 143-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). More than 60 mammalian UGT isoforms have been separated into two families and four subfamilies based on their primary amino acid sequence identity (17Mackenzie P.I. Owens I.S. Burchell B. Bock K.W. Bairoch A. Bélanger A. Fournel-Gigleux S. Green M. Hum D.W. Iyanagi T. Lancet D. Louisot P. Magdalou J. Chowdhury J.R. Ritter J.K. Schachter H. Tephly T.R. Tipton K.F. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). In humans, members of the UGT1A subfamily are encoded by a complex gene, which contains at least 17 exons spanning over 200 kb (18Owens I.S. Ritter J.K. Yeatman M.T. Chen F. J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 1996; 24: 491-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Located on chromosome 2q37, the UGT1A gene complex leads to the production of 13 different mRNAs by alternative splicing; whereas exons 14–17 are shared between all UGT1A isoforms, the 13 first exons encode the amino-terminal part of each protein and share between 37 and 90% amino acid sequence identity (16King C.D. Rios G.R. Green M.D. Tephly T.R. Curr. Drug Metab. 2000; 1: 143-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The common carboxyl part of UGT1A proteins contains the cofactor UDPGA binding site, whereas the substrate specificity of each enzyme is determined by the amino-terminal part of the protein (17Mackenzie P.I. Owens I.S. Burchell B. Bock K.W. Bairoch A. Bélanger A. Fournel-Gigleux S. Green M. Hum D.W. Iyanagi T. Lancet D. Louisot P. Magdalou J. Chowdhury J.R. Ritter J.K. Schachter H. Tephly T.R. Tipton K.F. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Belonging to the UGT1A subfamily, UGT1A9 catalyzes the conjugation of various bulky phenols, N-hydroxyarylamines, steroids, and several drugs (16King C.D. Rios G.R. Green M.D. Tephly T.R. Curr. Drug Metab. 2000; 1: 143-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 19Ebner T. Burchell B. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1993; 21: 50-55PubMed Google Scholar). UGT1A9 glucuronidates a variety of endogenous molecules, such as retinoic acid or thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) and is mainly involved in the metabolism of catecholestrogens (4-hydroxyestradiol (4OH-E1) and 4-hydroxyestrone (4OH-E2)) (20Findlay K.A.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3292-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that UGT1A9 also catalyzes glucuronidation of the synthetic PPAR activators, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, and troglitazone (22Watanabe Y. Nakajima M. Yokoi T. Drug Metab.

Furthermore, preliminary data indicate that UGT1A9 may conjugate natural PPARα and PPARγ agonists, such as 15-HETE and 13-HODE. 2A. Bélanger, personal communication. Human UGT1A9 is expressed in various tissues, including liver, intestine, kidney, mammary gland, and ovary (21Albert C. Vallee M. Beaudry G. Bélanger A. Hum D.W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3292-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Several studies in both humans and other animals reported that treatment with PPARα activators results in enhanced glucuronidation activity and UGT expression (26Hautanen A. Manttari M. Manninen V. Frick M.H. Adlercreutz H. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 433-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 27Mounie J. Champion L. Goudonnet H. Escousse A. Truchot R.C. Fundam. Clin.

In the Helsinki Heart Study population, gemfibrozil treatment resulted in a significant elevation of plasma androstane-3α,17β-diol glucuronide levels (26Hautanen A. Manttari M. Manninen V. Frick M.H. Adlercreutz H. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 433-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In rats, but not in mice, fenofibrate increases bilirubin glucuronidation in liver microsomes (27Mounie J. Champion L. Goudonnet H. Escousse A. Truchot R.C. Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol. 1988; 2: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 28Viollon-Abadie C. Bigot-Lasserre D. Nicod L. Carmichael N. Richert L. Toxicol. in Vitro. 2000; 14: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the same line, clofibrate induces the bilirubin-conjugating UGT1A1 protein in microsomes from rat liver (29Jemnitz K. Veres Z. Monostory K. Vereczkey L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2000; 28: 34-37PubMed Google Scholar). In rodents, clofibrate induces the glucuronidation of an antithrombotic thioxyloside (LF 4.0212), which is catalyzed by UGT1A9 in humans (30Pless D. Gouze J.N. Senay C. Herber R. Leroy P. Barberousse V. Fournel-Gigleux S. Magdalou J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1999; 27: 588-595PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we investigated in the present study whether UGT1A9 expression is regulated by PPARα and PPARγ agonists. Our results demonstrate that UGT1A9 is a positively regulated PPARα and PPARγ target gene. This increased expression is observed in human hepatocytes and macrophages as well as in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Induction of UGT1A9 gene expression is accompanied by an increased glucuronidation activity of catecholestrogens and fibrates. This positive regulation of UGT1A9 expression occurs at the transcriptional level by binding of PPARα and PPARγ to a DR1 response element located at −719 to −706 bp in the promoter region of the UGT1A9 gene. Furthermore, the role of PPARα in the fibrate-dependent induction of UGT1A9 is established by the absence of fibrate response in PPARα-null mice. Animal studies were performed in compliance with European Union specifications regarding the use of laboratory animals. Details of experimental conditions have been described previously (31Kockx M.

At the end of the treatment period, the animals were fasted for 4 h and sacrificed, and livers were removed immediately, weighed, rinsed in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until RNA or microsome preparation. Mononuclear cells were isolated from blood of healthy donors by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and cultured as described (5Chinetti G. Lestavel S. Bocher V. Remaley A.T. Neve B. Pineda Torra I.

Mature monocyte-derived macrophages were used for experiments after 10 days of culture. For treatment with PPARα and PPARγ agonists, medium was changed to medium without serum but supplemented with 1% nutridoma HU (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Human monocytic THP-1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and differentiated for 72 h with 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Differentiated cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of the indicated PPAR activators. Human primary hepatocytes were isolated as described previously (34Bode B.P. Kaminski D.L. Souba W.W. Li A.P. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 511-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated for the indicated times in dexamethasone-free Williams' E medium containing fenofibric acid (250 μm). Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS and differentiated in adipocytes according to the method of Bernlohr et al. (35Bernlohr D.A. Angus C.W. Lane M.D. Bolanowski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5468-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Two-day postconfluent cells were switched to differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS, 10 μg/ml insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm3-methyl-1-isobutylxanthine) for 10 days. Cells were then cultured in postdifferentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS, and insulin) with or without rosiglitazone (1 μm). Isolation and stable expression of the human UGT1A9 cDNA in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells has been previously described (21Albert C. Vallee M. Beaudry G. Bélanger A. Hum D.W.

RNA was isolated from mouse livers by the acid guanidium thiocyanate/chloroform method (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Two micrograms of total RNA from cultured cells and mouse livers were reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Reverse transcribed UGT1A9 and 28 S cDNAs were quantified by real time PCR on a MX 4000 apparatus (Stratagene) using the previously described specific primers for UGT1A9 and 28 S (37Congiu M. Mashford M.L. Slavin J.L. Desmond P.V. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2002; 30: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 38Claudel T. Sturm E. Duez H. Pineda Torra I. Sirvent A. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Dallongeville J. Hum D.W. Kuipers F. Staels B. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for murine UGT1A9 were mUGT1A9F (sense) 5′-GAAGAACATGCATTTTGCTCCT-3′ and mUGT1A9R (antisense) 5′-CTGGGCTAAAGAGGTCTGTCATAGTC-3′. PCR amplifications were performed in a volume of 25 μl containing a 100 nm concentration of each primer, 4 mm MgCl2, the Brilliant Quantitative PCR Core Reagent Kit mix as recommended by the manufacturer (Stratagene), and SYBR Green 0.33X (Sigma). The conditions were 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. UGT1A9 mRNA levels were subsequently normalized to 28 S mRNA. A nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used to analyze for significant difference between the experimental groups of wild type and PPARα null mice. A 1.1-kb genomic fragment containing a portion of the UGT1A9 promoter (from nucleotide +53 to −1115) was amplified by PCR, using forward 5′-CTAGCAGAAGCTTCAGTAGGTGGGAGAAATACCAGCAC-3′ and reverse 5′-CTAGCAGCTCGAGGAAAGACCGTCTCTTACTGGCAAG-3′ primers into whichXhoI and HindIII sites were introduced, respectively. The PCR amplification was performed in a final reaction volume of 50 μl under the following conditions: denaturation at 96 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 40 s at 60 °C, and 15 s at 72 °C, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR product was cloned into the XhoI and HindIII restriction sites of the pGL3 vector to generate the A9prom construct. Mutations were introduced in the DR1 site using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the A9promDR1mt(5′-TGACATCACCTCTGATTTCAAGGAGTGCTCAG-3′) oligonucleotide (nucleotides in boldface type are the mutated bases). The A9DR1-TKpGL3 and A9DR1mt-TKpGL3 plasmids were obtained by cloning three copies of the corresponding annealed oligonucleotides in the thymidine kinase promoter-driven luciferase reporter (TKpGL3) vector. For all assays, 40 × 103 COS cells were transfected with 100 ng of the indicated luciferase reporter plasmids, 50 ng of the pCMV-β-galactosidase expression vector, and with or without 20 ng of the pSG5-mRXRα, pSG5-hPPARα or pSG5-hPPARγ expression vectors, as indicated. All samples were complemented with pBS-SK+ plasmid (Stratagene) to an identical amount of 500 ng/well. COS cells were transfected using the ExGen reagent (Euromedex) for 3 h at 37 °C and subsequently incubated overnight with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.2% FCS and then treated for 24 h with either Me2SO (vehicle), Wy14643 (50 μm), or rosiglitazone (1 μm), as indicated. Human PPARα and PPARγ and mouse RXRα proteins were synthesized in vitro using the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4-polynucleotide kinase. For EMSA using in vitro produced proteins, PPARα, PPARγ, and/or RXR proteins were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in a total volume of 20 μl containing 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 1 μg of herring sperm DNA in binding buffer as previously described (39Pineda Torra I. Jamshidi Y. Flavell D.M. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1013-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled probes (A9DR1wt (5′-GACATCACCTCTGACCTCAAGGAG-3′), A9DR1mt5′ (5′-GACATAAAATCTGACCTCAAGGAG-3′), and A9DR1mt3′ (5′-GACATCACCTGTAAAATCAAGGAG-3′), where underlined nucleotides represent response element half-sites and bases in boldface type are mutated) were added, and the binding reaction was incubated for a further 15 min at room temperature. The protein complexes were resolved by 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.25× Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) at room temperature. For supershift experiments, anti-PPARα or anti-PPARγ antibodies (0.2 μg) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were preincubated for 20 min in the binding buffer before the addition ofin vitro produced proteins as described above. For competition experiments, the indicated excess quantities of unlabeled oligonucleotides were added to the binding reaction just before the labeled probes. The recombinant adenovirus (Ad)-GFP and Ad-PPARα were obtained by homologous recombination in Escherichia coli (40Chartier C. Degryse E. Gantzer M. Dieterle A. Pavirani A. Mehtali M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4805-4810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) after insertion of the cDNAs into the pAdCMV2 vector (Q.BIOgene, Illkirch, France). Viral stocks were then created as previously described (41Sardet C. Vidal M. Cobrinik D. Geng Y. Onufryk C. Chen A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2403-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Viral titers were determined by plaque assay on HEK 293 cells and defined as plaque-forming units/ml. 0.8 × 106 HepG2 cells were infected at an input multiplicity of 100 virus particles/cell by adding virus stocks directly to the culture medium. After 3 h of infection, cells were subsequently incubated for 24 h with either Me2SO (vehicle) or Wy14643 (50 μm). The human liver microsome preparation, purchased from the Human Cell Culture Center, Inc. (Laurel, MD) was from a pool of female subjects. Microsomal proteins were purified from HEK 293 cells stably expressing UGT1A9, THP1 cells treated or not with PPAR activators, or wild type or PPARα-null mouse livers as previously described (21Albert C. Vallee M. Beaudry G. Bélanger A. Hum D.W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3292-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Enzyme assays were performed as reported (21Albert C. Vallee M. Beaudry G. Bélanger A. Hum D.W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3292-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomes were incubated with 25 μm [14C]UDP-glucuronic acid, 2 mm unlabeled UDPGA, and 200 μm substrates in a final volume of 100 μl of glucuronidation assay buffer (21Albert C. Vallee M. Beaudry G. Bélanger A. Hum D.W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3292-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 37 °C for 30 min for fibrates, 1 h for 4OH-E1 and 4OH-E2, or 4 h for glitazones and were terminated by adding 100 μl of methanol. 100 μl of glucuronidation assays were applied onto a TLC plate (Merck) and migrated using a toluene/methanol/acetic acid (7:3:1) mix. The extent of substrate glucuronidation was analyzed and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Bio-Rad). Recent studies have indicated that UGT1A9 catalyzes glucuronidation of gemfibrozil, fenofibric acid, and troglitazone, suggesting that this enzyme is involved in the metabolism of synthetic PPAR activators (22Watanabe Y. Nakajima M. Yokoi T. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2002; 30: 1462-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Yoshigae Y. Konno K. Takasaki W. Ikeda T. J. Toxicol.

To further characterize the role of UGT1A9 in fibrate and glitazone glucuronide conjugation, microsomes from HEK 293 cells stably expressing UGT1A9 or from human liver (as positive control) were incubated with gemfibrozil, fenofibric acid, clofibric acid, ciprofibric acid, troglitazone, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone in the presence of radiolabeled cofactor UDPGA (TableI). Whereas all fibrates were glucuronidated by microsomes from UGT1A9-HEK 293 cells and human liver, only a low level of troglitazone glucuronide formation was detected, and pioglitazone and rosiglitazone were not glucuronidated in either microsome preparation (Table I). UGT1A9 glucuronidated all fibrates tested with a similar efficacy (between 259 and 343 pmol·min−1·mg of protein−1 for gemfibrozil and ciprofibric acid, respectively), whereas gemfibrozil was glucuronidated 2-fold more by human liver microsomes, compared with other fibrates (Table I). Interestingly, troglitazone was glucuronidated with a 10-fold lower activity than fibrates by both UGT1A9 and human liver microsomes, whereas pioglitazone and rosiglitazone were not glucuronidated in human liver. These results demonstrate that UGT1A9 is able to convert fibrates and, to a lesser extent, troglitazone into their glucuronide derivatives.Table IIn vitro glucuronidation of fibrates and glitazones by microsomes isolated from human liver and HEK 293 cells expressing UGT1A9Glucuronide formationUGT1A9Human liverpmol·min−1·mg protein −1Gemfibrozil292, 259682, 762Fenofibric acid301, 264189, 231Clofibric acid310, 310302, 315Ciprofibric acid343, 322317, 370Troglitazone30, 2555, 74RosiglitazoneNDNDPioglitazoneNDNDResults represent the values obtained in two independent experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2144107414,"In this study, we describe an ordered formation of long- and very long-chain ceramide species in relation to the progression of B-cell receptor (BcR) triggering induced apoptosis. An early and caspase-independent increase in long-chain ceramide species, in which C(16)- ceramide predominated, was observed 6 h after BcR triggering. In contrast, very long-chain ceramide species were generated later, 12-24 h after BcR triggering. The formation of these very long-chain ceramide species, in which C(24)-ceramide predominated, required the activation of effector caspases. BcR-induced formation of long-chain ceramide species resulted in proteasomal activation and degradation of XIAP and subsequent activation of effector caspases, demonstrating an important cell-biological mechanism through which long-chain ceramides may be involved in the progression of BcR triggering induced apoptosis and subsequent formation of very long-chain ceramide species. BcR-induced activation of the proteasome was blocked with ISP-1/myriocin, a potent and selective inhibitor of serine palmitoyl transferase that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the de novo formation of ceramide. Both ISP-1 and clasto-lactacystin beta-lactone, an irreversible inhibitor of the proteasome, prevented BcR cross-linking-induced XIAP degradation. Also, a mutant XIAP lacking the ubiquitin-ligating ring finger motif was completely resistant to proteasome-mediated degradation, and Ramos cells overexpressing XIAP became highly resistant to BcR cross-linking-induced activation of caspases. The formation of C(16)-ceramide in response to BcR cross-linking was found unaltered in XIAP overexpressing Ramos cells, whereas C(24)-ceramide formation was completely abolished. These results demonstrate how de novo generated long-chain ceramide species may be involved in the activation of downstream effector caspases and subsequent formation of very long-chain ceramide species. As such, these results provide novel and important insights into the significance of specific ceramide species in defined stages of apoptosis."

The enzyme was highly specific for agmatine as acyl acceptor and had the highest specificity forp-coumaroyl-CoA among various acyl donors with a specific activity of 29.7 nanokatal × mg−1 protein. Barley ACT was found to be a single polypeptide chain of 48 kDa with a pI of 5.20 as determined by isoelectric focusing. The 15 N-terminal amino acid residues were identified by micro-sequencing of the native protein and were used to clone a full-length barley ACT cDNA that predicted a protein of 439 amino acid residues. The sequence was devoid of N-terminal signal peptide, suggesting a cytosolic localization of barley ACT. Recombinant ACT produced and affinity-purified fromEscherichia coli had a specific activity of 189 nanokatal × mg−1 protein, thus confirming the identity of the purified native protein. A partial cDNA sequence for ACT was obtained from wheat that predicted a protein of 353 amino acid residues and had 95% sequence identity to barley ACT. Two motifs in the amino acid sequence reveal that barley ACT represents a new class of N-hydroxycinnamoyltransferases belonging to the transferase superfamily.

The enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of hydroxycinnamoylagmatines from agmatine and hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA thiolesters in barley (Hordeum vulgare). Hydroxycinnamoylagmatines are direct precursor of hordatines (Fig.1), which are antifungal compounds found to be highly abundant in the young barley seedling (3Stoessl A. Can. J. Chem. 1967; 45: 1745-1760Crossref Google Scholar). The hordatines seem to be confined to the genus Hordeum as preformed infection inhibitors (4Smith T.A. Best G.R.

Biotechnol.

Related hydroxycinnamic acid amides are found throughout the plant kingdom, and three plantN-hydroxycinnamoyltransferases have been purified and characterized: tyramine N-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (THT, EC 2.3.1.110) (11Hohlfeld H.

Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 777-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In general, the role of hydroxycinnamic acid amides remains speculative, but conjugation compounds of tyramine have been repeatedly reported to be present in cell wall fractions from several plant species, and they are believed to produce a phenolic barrier against pathogens by reducing cell wall digestibility (16Grandmaison J.

Putrescine N-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase and HCBT appeared as monomers with native molecular masses of about 44 to 50 kDa, whereas the THTs all appeared as dimers (11Hohlfeld H. Scheel D. Strack D.

In this study, we develop an enzyme purification strategy and report the purification of a barley ACT isoform to apparent homogeneity. Furthermore, we describe some new characteristics of the protein and the sequencing of the 15 N-terminal amino acids. Full-length ACT cDNAs were cloned, and the identity of the purified protein was confirmed by heterologous expression of an ACT cDNA inEscherichia coli showing in vitro ACT activity. Finally, based on protein sequence alignment of the ACT, HCBT, and THTs, we suggest that ACT is a new class of the amineN-hydroxycinnamoyltransferases belonging to a diverse transferase family. Barley (H. vulgare L., cv. Triumph) was sown on top of an ∼3-cm layer of soil and covered with a thin layer of fine gravel. The moistened trays were wrapped in black plastic bags and placed in a growth chamber (22 °C, 24 h of darkness). Seedlings were harvested 3 days after sowing, frozen in liquid N2, ground to a fine powder with a mortar and a pestle, and stored at −80 °C for subsequent protein purification. The hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA thiolesters were enzymatically synthesized using recombinant tobacco 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase (4CL). The E. coli strain carrying the Nt4CL-19 plasmid was used to prepare crude E. coli protein extracts essentially as described (26Lee D. Douglas C.J. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The extracts containing 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase were adjusted to 30% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. The ligase reaction was as described (27Meng H. Campbell W.H. Phytochenistry. 1997; 44: 605-608Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and after 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, synthesized cinnamoyl-CoA derivatives were purified on LC-18 solid phase extraction columns (Supelco) as described (27Meng H. Campbell W.H. Phytochenistry. 1997; 44: 605-608Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) except that MOPS was replaced by 0.2 m Tris, pH 7.5, in all procedures. The hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA derivatives were concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge to ∼0.5 mm and stored at −20 °C. The molecular weights of compounds were determined by nanoelectrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. ACT assay solution containing synthesized p-coumaroylagmatine was loaded on micro-scale reverse phase columns (∼0.2 × 8 mm) packed with Poros Oligo R3 (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in 10-μl Gel-loader pipette tips (Eppendorf). Columns were washed with 40 μl of 5% (v/v) formic acid and eluted directly into precoated borosilicate nanoelectrospray needles (Protana, Denmark) with 2.5 μl of 5% (v/v) formic acid, 50% (v/v) methanol. The nanoelectrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was performed on a Finnigan LCQ quadropole ion storage mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA). A potential of 0.71 kV and manual syringe pressure was applied to the needles. Conditions for the nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry were as follows: capillary temperature 240 °C, capillary voltage 34 V, maximum ion injection time 50 ms, and 3 microscans. Collision-induced dissociation was performed on the [M + H]+ ions formed by nanoelectrospray using argon as the collision gas. Mass spectrometry spectra of p-coumaroyl-CoA andp-coumaroylagmatine were acquired in them/z range from 800 to 1100 and 75 to 300, respectively. The following buffers were used in the enzyme purification: Buffer A, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm KCl, and 250 mm sucrose; Buffer B, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm KCl; Buffer C, same as B but 2.5 m KCl instead of 50 mm KCl; Buffer D, same as B but 2.0 m CH3COOK replacing KCl; Buffer E same as B but 0.5 m KCl instead of 50 mm KCl; Buffer F, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm KCl. Buffers (100 mm) used to determine the pH optimum of the enzyme were MES (pH 5.5–6.7), Bis-Tris (pH 5.8–7.2), MOPS (pH 6.5–7.9), TES (6.8–8.2), HEPES (pH 7.0–8.4), Tris (pH 7.5–8.9), glycine (pH 8.8–10.2), and CAPS (pH 9.7–11.1). The reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 15 mm α-monothioglycerol, 10% (v/v) ACT extract, 10 μm hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA, and 0.2 mm agmatine. Assays were started by the addition of agmatine. ACT activity was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease inA333 (2Bird C.R. Smith T.A. Phytochemistry. 1983; 22: 2401-2403Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA was slowly degraded in the absence of agmatine: thus, controls were run, and the rates were subtracted from those for the samples. For the blank, agmatine were replaced by double distilled H2O. Assays were performed at 25 °C. The documented extinction coefficients for hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA derivatives (28Stöckigt J. Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforsch. 1975; 30: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) were used for ACT activity calculations. All assays were performed with five replicates. All procedures were performed at 4 °C, and chromatography was done on a fast protein liquid chromatography system from Amersham Biosciences. All columns and chromatographic materials used for ACT purification were purchased fromAmersham Biosciences. The Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce) was used for quantification of protein concentration throughout the purification steps using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Frozen ground barley seedlings (200 g) were mixed with Buffer A (1:5 w/v) in a mortar and gently stirred with a pestle for 15 min. The slurry was filtered through two layers of nylon mesh and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.20-μm filter and collected as crude extract (Step 1). The crude protein extract was chromatographed in 50-ml aliquots on a blue Sepharose column (HiTrap Blue HP, 5 ml) equilibrated in Buffer B. After loading, the column was washed in 20 column volumes (CV) of Buffer B before a step gradient (5 CV of 50% and 20 CV of 100%) of Buffer C was applied at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and subsequently assayed for ACT activity (Step 2). Fractions containing ACT activity from the individual runs were pooled and adjusted to 2 m CH3COOK. The slurry was gently stirred for 2 h and then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was chromatographed in aliquots of 50 ml on a t-butyl hydrophobic interaction chromatography column (25-ml butyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow in a XK 26 column) previously equilibrated in Buffer D. The column was washed in 5 CV of Buffer D before bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient (100–0% in 16 CV) of Buffer B at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Fractions of 8 ml were collected and assayed for ACT activity (Step 3). Active protein fractions collected from the individual runs of Step 3 were pooled and dialyzed twice for 24 h against Buffer B. The dialyzed protein was chromatographed in aliquots of 50 ml on a RESOURCE Q (1 ml) column equilibrated in Buffer B. The column was washed in 10 CV of Buffer B before a linear gradient (0–100% in 50 CV) of Buffer E was applied at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and assayed for ACT activity (Step 4). Active protein fractions from the individual runs of Step 4 were pooled and concentrated to ∼100 μl in two steps using Centriplus YM-10 and Microcon YM-10 centrifugal filter devices (Amicon, Millipore), respectively. The ACT concentrate was loaded onto a Superose 12 HR 10/30 equilibrated in Buffer F. Protein was eluted with buffer F at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and fractions of 0.3 ml were collected and assayed for ACT activity (Step 5). SDS-PAGE was carried out in a Hoefer Mighty Small II SE 260 vertical minigel system using NOVEX pre-cast 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris 1.0-mm gels. Running buffer was 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.7, containing 50 mm Tris base, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA. The isoelectric point of ACT was determined with a 2117 Multiphor II flatbed electrophoresis system using pre-cast polyacrylamide gels containing ampholines in the pH range 3.5–9.5 (Ampholine PAGplate, Amersham Bioscience). Isoelectric focusing gels were fixed in 3.45% sulfosalicylic acid, 11.5% trichloroacetic acid, and 30% ethanol. To visualize proteins, gels were subjected to silver staining using the method reported in Morrissey (29Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar) except that ethanol replaced methanol, and glutaraldehyde fixation was omitted. The molecular mass of native ACT was estimated by chromatography on the Superose 12 HR 10/30 using a molecular weight marker kit (Sigma, MW-GF-200). The molecular mass of denatured ACT was estimated by SDS-PAGE by use of molecular weight standards (NOVEX, Mark12; Mo Bi Tec, BOA001). The ACT fraction purified to apparent homogeneity was concentrated on an Amicon centrifugal filter device with a 10-kDa nominal molecular weight limit (Microcon, Millipore). Concentrated protein (1–10 μg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore) using the Hoefer Semiphor (Amersham Biosciences) semidry blotting system. Transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 200 mmglycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol per liter) was used for electroblotting for 1 h at 0.8 mA/cm2 gel. The transferred protein was stained with Coomassie (0.25% Coomassie Blue R-250, 10% acetic acid, and 40% ethanol) for 3 min and then washed in destaining solution (10% acetic acid and 40% ethanol) for several changes. Finally the membrane was washed several times in double distilled H2O and then allowed to air dry. The stained protein band was cut out and frozen in Eppendorf tubes until sequencing was performed by Edman degradation on a Procise 494 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Two runs of Edman sequencing (15 cycles of automated pulse liquid chemistry) were carried out. A TBlastN data base search (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) using the 15 N-terminal amino acid residues obtained from purified ACT identified five EST clones (accession numbers BF259608, BI959297, BF628198, BI955449, BF619699, andBM137380). Two sets of primers were designed for 5′- and 3′-RACE, respectively. Oligonucleotides for 3′-RACE (CATGAAGATCACCGTGCACTC, ATCCTGCTCAACGACGCC) and for 5′-RACE (GAGTGCACGGTGATCTTCATG, GGCGTCGTTGAGCAGGATCG) were used in combination with vector primers for nested amplification from cDNA libraries. Copy DNA libraries of leaf mRNA from barley and wheat in λ phage (ZAP-XR and ZAP, Stratagene, respectively) were used as template in the amplification reactions. RACE was performed with 500 ng of cDNA as template using the editing Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. Amplification was initiated by 2 min of denaturing at 94 °C followed by 25 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 20 s, and elongation at 68 °C for 60 s plus 2 s/cycle. Amplification was terminated by a 10-min incubation at 68 °C. PCR products were cloned in pCR4-TOPO vector and sequenced on both strands using vector and internal primers. Sequencing was carried out on an ABI 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using the DYEnamic ET terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Sequences were proofread using Sequencher software Version 3.1.1 (Gene Codes Corp., MI). Sequences and contigs were analyzed by MacVector 7.0 (Oxford Molecular software). TwoNdeI adapter primers (GGAATTCCATATGAAGATCACCGTGCACTCTTC, GGAATTCCATATGCTAGGCAAGTGGCTAACGTTGATCC) were used to amplify the coding region of pHV-ACT5-28-6 using Dynazyme EXT polymerase (Finnzymes, Finland). Digested PCR fragments were cloned into the NdeI site of pET15b (Novagen). Fidelity and orientation was confirmed by sequencing. E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) harboring the pET-ACT construct was grown in Luria Bertoni medium at 37 °C to a cell density of 1.3 (A600). The culture was cooled to 28 °C before induction of expression, which was carried out at 28 °C for 3 h after the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.5 mm. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, 15 mmα-monothioglycerol, 50 mm NaCl, and lysed by incubation with 100 μg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) at 30 °C for 15 min followed by sonication and centrifugation (20,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). The supernatant buffer was changed to 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm imidazole, and 500 mm NaCl by gel filtration (HiTrap desalting, 5 ml, Amersham Biosciences), and soluble histidine-tagged recombinant ACT was purified by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) affinity chromatography as described by the manufacturer. After loading, the column was washed with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 20 mmimidazole and 500 mm NaCl, and the His-tagged protein was eluted with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 500 mm imidazole and 500 mm NaCl. Protein samples were stored on ice. Fractions were assayed for ACT activity, and purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Activity of bacterial-expressed ACT was examined in the presence of diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC). DEPC stock solutions were made up immediately before use in anhydrous alcohol. All enzyme incubations were carried out at 25 °C. The affinity-purified enzyme (150 ng) was incubated with various concentrations of DEPC before dividing into working aliquots containing 7.5 ng of recombinant ACT. After a 5-min incubation, excess DEPC was quenched with a corresponding amount of imidazole before monitoring the ACT activity. For the substrate protection experiment, ACT was incubated for 5 min with either 10 μmp-coumaroyl-CoA or 0.2 mmagmatine before the addition of 1 mm DEPC. Shortly after the existence of amine N-hydroxycinnamoyltransferases in plants was demonstrated (1Bird C.R. Smith T.A. Phytochemistry. 1981; 20: 2345-2346Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), ACT was partially purified from young etiolated barley seedlings (2Bird C.R. Smith T.A. Phytochemistry. 1983; 22: 2401-2403Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Since then only hydroxycinnamoylagmatine derivatives have been detected and characterized in barley (6Peipp H. Maier W.

In this study, 3-day-old barley seedlings were chosen as the source for the ACT purification because hordatine accumulation reaches its maximum within the first 3–6 days after germination when plants are grown at 20 °C (4Smith T.A. Best G.R. Phytochemistry. 1978; 17: 1093-1098Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33Bird C.R. Smith T.A. Ann. Bot. 1984; 53: 483-488Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Coumaroyl-CoA was used as the hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA substrate to monitor the enzyme activity during purification. It was synthesized using crude extracts of E. coli expressing recombinant tobacco 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase (26Lee D. Douglas C.J. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and subsequently purified on C-18 solid phase extraction columns (27Meng H. Campbell W.H. Phytochenistry. 1997; 44: 605-608Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The spectrum of the individual purified and concentrated hydroxycinnamoyl-CoAs was as previously reported (28Stöckigt J. Zenk M.H. Z. Naturforsch. 1975; 30: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Additionally, mass spectrometry analysis of purifiedp-coumaroyl-CoA solution showed a [M + H]+value of m/z 913.8, the molecular weight of this compound. Before purification was initiated, crude extracts of a number of commercial barley varieties were tested for ACT activity; however, only minor differences were observed between 10 varieties compared. Seedlings grown in light showed only slightly higher ACT activity; thus, etiolated seedlings were chosen as the enzyme source to avoid the presence of chlorophyll during the purification. Enzyme activity could only be detected in the soluble protein extract; TableI lists the five-step procedure for ACT purification, which includes four different column chromatography steps. The amount of ACT activity in the extracts of young barley seedlings required a concentration of the ACT activity before the first chromatographic step to avoid an excessive dilution. For this purpose, the immobilized reactive dye Cibacron blue F3G-A was used for batch enrichment of the enzyme activity. An 11-fold purification was obtained from the blue Sepharose column after eluting with KCl (Fig.2, lane 2). It was possible to elute ACT specifically from Cibacron blue F3G-A using the substrate coumaroyl-CoA. However, large quantities of coumaroyl-CoA were needed to efficiently elute the enzyme, and a number of unrelated proteins co-eluted with ACT even when different chromatographic steps were performed before the blue Sepharose step.Table IPurification of ACT activity from etiolated barley seedlingsStepMethodTotal activityTotal proteinSpecific activityYieldPurificationnanokatalmgnanokatal/mg%-fold1Crude extract1-aThe crude extract was prepared from 200 g of frozen etiolated barley seedlings.33.413070.02610012Blue Sepharose25.186.70.2975113t-Butyl-Sepharose5.07.20.7015274RESOURCE Q2.00.3845.1362015Superose 12 HR1.00.03329.7311621-a The crude extract was prepared from 200 g of frozen etiolated barley seedlings. Open table in a new tab Hydrophobic interaction chromatography was chosen as the third step despite the considerable loss in total ACT activity encountered; this step was found to be essential for successful ACT purification (Fig. 2,lane 3). Active ACT was only recoverable whent-butyl and not phenyl was used as the hydrophobic interaction chromatography ligand. The high KCl concentration (1.25m) from the second purification step ensured salting-out of the potassium acetate used to generate interactions between the enzyme and the t-butyl media. The following anion exchange chromatography step separated ACT activity into two peaks, one containing a complex mixture of proteins and the other ∼10 proteins as visualized from a silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel; one of them, ∼ 48 kDa, was particularly prominent (Fig. 2, lane 4). The two ACT activity peaks were each subjected to Superose 12 HR molecular size exclusion chromatography. In both chromatographic runs, the 48-kDa protein was very prominent, but the first ACT peak from the anion exchange chromatography was still not pure, whereas the second peak provided ACT purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 2,lane 5) as judged by silver-stained SDS-PAGE. The purification protocol through four chromatographic steps, thus, provided a 1162-fold purification, with a yield of 3%, the main loss in activity occu"

The binding site for collagen types I and III is located in the VWF-A3 domain. Recently, we showed that His1023, located near the edge between the “front” and “bottom” faces of A3, is critical for collagen binding (Romijn, R. A., Bouma, B., Wuyster, W., Gros, P., Kroon, J., Sixma, J. J., and Huizinga, E. G. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 9985–9991). To map the binding site in detail, we introduced 22 point mutations in the front and bottom faces of A3. The mutants were expressed as multimeric VWF, and binding to collagen type III was evaluated in a solid-state binding assay and by surface plasmon resonance. Mutation of residues Asp979, Ser1020, and His1023 nearly abolished collagen binding, whereas mutation of residues Ile975, Thr977, Val997, and Glu1001 reduced binding affinity about 10-fold. Together, these residues define a flat and rather hydrophobic collagen-binding site located at the front face of the A3 domain. The collagen-binding site of VWF-A3 is distinctly different from that of the homologous integrin α2 I domain, which has a hydrophilic binding site located at the top face of the domain. Based on the surface characteristics of the collagen-binding site of A3, we propose that it interacts with collagen sequences containing positively charged and hydrophobic residues. Docking of a collagen triple helix on the binding site suggests a range of possible engagements and predicts that at most eight consecutive residues in a collagen triple helix interact with A3.

Residues Gln966, Ser974, Ile975, Thr977, Asp979, Val980, Pro981, Asn983, Val984, Val985, Ser993, Val997, Gln999, Glu1001, Gln1006, Asp1009, Ser1020, Glu1021, and Met1022 were mutated to alanine. In addition, Pro962, Pro981, and Pro1027 were mutated to histidine to inhibit collagen binding by steric hindrance. Backbone conformations of these proline residues suggested that the histidine side chain would protrude from the protein surface. Point mutations were introduced in the VWF-A3 domain using the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (23Romijn R.A. Bouma B. Wuyster W. Gros P. Kroon J. Sixma J.J.

VWF concentration was determined by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using polyclonal α-VWF and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal α-VWF (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) for immobilization and detection, respectively (7Lankhof H. van Hoeij M.

Normal pooled plasma from 40 healthy donors was used as a reference. The multimeric structure of VWF was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting as described by Lawrie et al. (24Lawrie A.S. Horser M.J. Savidge G.F. Thromb.

Microtiter plate wells (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated with a polyclonal antibody directed against the D′ and D3 domains of VWF (22Van der Plas R.M. Gomes L. Marquart J.A. Vink T.

Coating was carried out for 3 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed with PBS-T (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20) and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS-T for 1 h at 37 °C. Expression medium containing VWF was diluted with mock medium to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Wells were incubated with diluted medium for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, 2 μg/ml RU5 in PBS-T containing 3% bovine serum albumin was added for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed again and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (DAKO) diluted 1:2500 in PBS-T containing 3% bovine serum albumin.O-Phenylenediamine was used as substrate for detection. Binding of VWF in expression medium to fibrillar human placenta collagen type III (catalogue no. C-4407; Sigma) was studied in a solid-state binding assay at a VWF concentration of 0.1 μg/ml as described previously (23Romijn R.A. Bouma B. Wuyster W. Gros P. Kroon J. Sixma J.J. Huizinga E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9985-9991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding studies were performed using a Biacore2000 system (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Fibrillar collagen cannot be used in a Biacore system because it blocks the flow channels. Therefore, we used acid-soluble collagen type III. Previously, we have shown that binding of wt-VWF to acid-soluble collagen is similar to the binding of wt-VWF to fibrillar collagen in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (22Van der Plas R.M. Gomes L. Marquart J.A. Vink T. Meijers J.C.M. de Groot Ph. G. Sixma J.J. Huizinga E.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1005-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Human placenta collagen type III was dissolved in 50 mm acetic acid at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml (16 h, 4 °C) and immobilized on a CM5 biosensor chip using the amine coupling kit as instructed by the supplier. Approximately 3000 response units of collagen type III, which corresponds to 30 ng/mm2, were immobilized. A reference channel was coated with a similar amount of human placenta collagen type IV (catalogue no. C-7521; Sigma) that does not interact with VWF (25Sixma J.J. van Zanten G.H. Huizinga E.G. Van der Plas R.M. Verkley M. Wu Y.P. Gros P. de Groot P.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Analysis was performed in Biacore standard buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, 125 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20 (pH 7.4) at 25 °C at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Binding of VWF to the collagen type III-coated channel was corrected for nonspecific binding to the control channel (between 2% and 5%). VWF monomer concentrations were calculated on the basis of a monomer mass of 270 kDa. Collagen binding at equilibrium was determined at different VWF concentrations. To this end, increasing concentrations of VWF were injected. Each injection was continued for 30 min. The delay between injections was 7 min, during which time the biosensor chip was flushed with Biacore standard buffer. After measuring all concentrations of a VWF variant, the biosensor chip was regenerated by injection of 1 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 5.0) (1 min, 10 μl/min) and 10 mmtaurodeoxycholic acid, 100 mm Tris (pH 9.0) (1 min, 10 μl/min), and 0.1 m H3PO4 (1 min, 10 μl/min). Dissociation constants (KD) and the number of binding sites expressed as the response at infinite VWF concentration (Req,max) were calculated as follows. First, the response at equilibrium (Req) was calculated for each association curve by fitting the data points with a 1:1 Langmuir interaction model (Biaeveluation software version 3.0.1). This interaction model fitted the experimental data well, despite the multivalent nature of the VWF-collagen interaction, with χ2 values being typically lower than 1.5. Use of more complex binding models did not improve the fit significantly. Next, KD andReq,max were determined from the binding isotherms (Req plotted against VWF concentration) by fitting equation Req =Req,max*[VWF]/(KD + [VWF]), which describes a 1:1 interaction. The fit was calculated using computer program GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Because interaction between VWF and collagen is multivalent and we used a 1:1 interaction model, calculated dissociation constants must be regarded as apparent values. The conformation of the A3 domain and the multimeric size of VWF determine its reactivity toward collagen. Multimer distributions of VWF mutants and recombinant wt-VWF were indistinguishable (data not shown). The conformation of the A3 domain was evaluated with conformation-dependent monoclonal antibody RU5. Binding of RU5 to 18 of the 22 point mutants was similar to binding to wt-VWF. As expected, RU5 did not bind to ΔA3-VWF, a deletion mutant lacking the A3 domain (7Lankhof H. van Hoeij M. Schiphorst M.E. Bracke M. Wu Y.P. Ijsseldijk M.J. Vink T. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (Fig.1A). Four of the point mutants, P962H, P981A, V984A, and V985A, showed a significantly reduced RU5 binding, ranging from 60% to 80% compared with wt-VWF. However, collagen binding of these mutants was normal (see below). Reduced RU5 binding can be explained by direct interactions of the mutated residues with RU5, as observed in the crystal structure of the A3·RU5 complex (23Romijn R.A. Bouma B. Wuyster W. Gros P. Kroon J. Sixma J.J. Huizinga E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9985-9991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Overall, these data suggest that the A3 domains of all VWF variants are correctly folded. In a first screen, the effect of mutations on binding to collagen type III was assessed by a solid-state collagen binding assay (Fig. 1B). Immobilized collagen was incubated with expression medium containing 0.1 μg/ml VWF. Binding of ΔA3-VWF to collagen was only 8% compared with wt-VWF. Mutations I975A, T977A, D979A, P981H, V997A, E1001A, and S1020A strongly reduced collagen binding, showing a residual binding of less than 25%. To further investigate the effect of the seven mutations, these mutants and mutant H1023A from our previous study (23Romijn R.A. Bouma B. Wuyster W. Gros P. Kroon J. Sixma J.J. Huizinga E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9985-9991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were purified by immuno-affinity chromatography, and collagen binding was analyzed by SPR. We also purified and analyzed wt-VWF and mutants P981A and E1021A that bound normally to collagen in the solid-state collagen binding assay. The multimer distribution of the VWF variants after purification was similar (Fig. 2). Addition of the RU5 Fab fragment to wt-VWF almost completely inhibited collagen binding, confirming that the A3 domain contains the binding site for collagen type III (Fig. 3). Mutants P981A and E1021A, which bound normally to collagen in the solid-state collagen binding assay, also had similar binding affinities and a similar number of binding sites as wt-VWF in the SPR-based collagen binding assay (Fig. 3). Mutants that exhibited strongly reduced collagen binding in the solid-state assay divided in two populations in the SPR collagen binding assay. Mutations I975A, T977A, V997A, and E1001A reduced the affinity of VWF for collagen 5–10-fold, whereas at saturation, the number of binding sites was at least 60% compared with wt-VWF (TableI). Mutants D979A, P981H, S1020A, and H1023A had a residual binding at saturation of less than 20% compared with wt-VWF.Table IApparent dissociation constants and maximum binding for the VWF-collagen interactionVWF variantKD ± SE1-aS.E. of the fitted values from nonlinear regression.Req,max1-bMaximum binding is expressed as the response at infinite VWF concentration. ± SE1-aS.E. of the fitted values from nonlinear regression.nmRUwt-VWF3.3 ± 0.3503 ± 10P981A2.7 ± 0.2440 ± 8E1021A5.8 ± 0.6540 ± 14I975A28 ± 2.8420 ± 18T977A25 ± 4.4419 ± 38V997A24 ± 2.5551 ± 23E1001A39 ± 8.1310 ± 31D979A1-cCollagen binding of these variants was too low to calculate reliable KD values.

Req,max for these mutants was estimated from the binding isotherms at a VWF concentration of 74 nm. Open table in a new tab Binding constants were derived from the binding isotherms shown in Fig.3. As shown in Fig. 4A, mutations that reduce collagen binding are located at the front face of the domain and define a rather flat collagen-binding site. Mutations at the bottom face did not have an effect. Surface properties of the collagen-binding site are shown in Fig. 4, B andC. The upper part of the collagen-binding site contains a small negatively charged patch. In addition, the collagen-binding site contains one large hydrophobic patch and two smaller hydrophobic patches. The amino acid sequence of collagen that is recognized by the VWF-A3 domain is not known. Under these circumstances, the use of automated docking procedures, such as FTdock (26Gabb H.A. Jackson R.M. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) and AutoDock (27Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9301) Google Scholar), that use scoring functions based on shape complementarity and interaction energies is not meaningful. Therefore, we used the interactive molecular graphics program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) to obtain an impression of possible collagen-binding modes compatible with structural and mutagenesis data. Because the amino acids of A3 that are involved in collagen binding define an extended and rather flat surface at the front face of the domain, a bound collagen triple helix must lie nearly parallel to the front face. A model of a triple helix restricted to lie parallel to the front face of A3 was rotated and translated with respect to A3, and two criteria were evaluated to select possible binding modes. Firstly, the collagen triple helix should contact (d < 4 Å) all residues of A3 involved in collagen binding. Secondly, monoclonal antibody RU5 bound to A3, as observed in the crystal structure of the A3·RU5 complex (23Romijn R.A. Bouma B. Wuyster W. Gros P. Kroon J. Sixma J.J. Huizinga E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9985-9991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), should block (d < 2 Å) binding of collagen by sterical hindrance. For the evaluation of distances, we assumed a fairly large radius for the collagen triple helix of 9 Å, which corresponds to the approximate distance from the tip of an extended lysine side chain to the center of the triple helix. Using a smaller radius would have reduced the range of possible binding modes, but in the absence of knowledge about the collagen residues actually involved, this did not seem justified. A range of orientations of the collagen triple helix fulfilled the criteria (Fig. 4D). In these potential binding modes, the collagen triple helix lies at an angle of about 60° to 90° to strand β3 (located at the front face of the domain) and interacts with the A3 domain via six to eight consecutive residues. Von Willebrand factor A-type domains are found in many proteins including collagens, complement proteins, and integrins, where they are named I domains. These proteins are involved in several biological functions such as cell-cell interaction and ligand-receptor binding. In integrins, these interactions involve a divalent cation present in the MIDAS motif located at the top of the domain. VWF contains three A-type domains, of which the A3 domain binds to collagen. The VWF-A3 domain does not contain a functional MIDAS motif, and collagen binding is cation-independent (20Pietu G. Fressinaud E. Girma J.P. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Rothschild C. Meyer D. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1987; 109: 637-646PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bockenstedt P.L. McDonagh J. Handin R.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Previously, we excluded the top face of A3 from being involved in collagen binding (22Van der Plas R.M. Gomes L. Marquart J.A. Vink T. Meijers J.C.M. de Groot Ph. G. Sixma J.J. Huizinga E.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1005-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and showed that His1023, located close to the edge of the front and bottom face, is critical for binding of VWF to collagen (23Romijn R.A. Bouma B. Wuyster W. Gros P. Kroon J. Sixma J.J. Huizinga E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9985-9991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we constructed a panel of 22 point mutants in which solvent-exposed residues were mutated to either alanine or histidine. These mutations were introduced in multimeric VWF, and the binding of these VWF mutants to collagen type III was evaluated. In a solid-state collagen binding assay, 7 of the 22 mutants, namely, I975A, T977A, D979A, P981H, V997A, E1001A, and S1020A, displayed reduced collagen type III binding. None of these mutations are located at the bottom face of A3, excluding its involvement in collagen binding. We further characterized these seven mutants and mutant H1023A, which also displays strongly reduced collagen binding (23Romijn R.A. Bouma B. Wuyster W. Gros P. Kroon J. Sixma J.J. Huizinga E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9985-9991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), by SPR. In contrast to the solid-state binding assay, SPR analysis measures collagen binding under equilibrium conditions and is not affected by washing steps. The apparent dissociation constant for binding of wt-VWF to collagen type III as determined by SPR was 3.3 nm, which is similar to values previously determined by us and others (22Van der Plas R.M. Gomes L. Marquart J.A. Vink T. Meijers J.C.M. de Groot Ph. G. Sixma J.J. Huizinga E.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1005-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Saenko E. Kannicht C. Loster K. Sarafanov A. Khrenov A. Kouiavskaia D. Shima M. Ananyeva N. Schwinn H. Gruber G. Josic D. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutants that were qualified as “strongly reduced” in the solid-state assay separated in two groups in the SPR analysis. Mutants D979A, S1020A, and H1023A displayed a large reduction in affinity and in the number of binding sites, showing that these residues are critical for collagen type III binding. In contrast, mutants I975A, T977A, V997A, and E1001A were characterized by a 5–10-fold reduced affinity but had a near normal number of binding sites, indicating that these residues contribute to collagen binding but are not essential. Residues essential for collagen binding are located in strand β3 and loop α3β4 in the lower half of the front face of A3, whereas nonessential residues are located in the upper half of the front face in loops β2β3, α2α3, helix α3, and strand β3 (Fig. 3A). Mutation of Pro981 to alanine did not affect collagen binding, whereas mutation to histidine markedly decreased VWF binding to collagen. Apparently, Pro981 is not required for binding to collagen type III, but the introduction of a bulky histidine side chain at the lower half of the front face of the domain interferes with collagen binding via sterical hindrance. This observation further supports our conclusion that the collagen-binding site is located at the front face of A3. Docking of a collagen triple helix on the front face of the A3 domain suggested a range of possible engagements (Fig. 4D) and predicts that at most eight consecutive residues in a collagen molecule interact with A3. Based on the surface characteristics of the collagen-binding site (Fig. 4, B and C), we propose that collagen sequences recognized by A3 contain positively charged and hydrophobic residues. Despite their similarity in fold and ligand, VWF-A3 and collagen-binding integrin I domains have distinctly different binding sites. In A3, a rather hydrophobic and flat binding site is located at the front face, whereas integrin I domains bind collagen in a predominantly hydrophilic groove at their top face and require a functional MIDAS motif (18Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 100: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 30Smith C. Estavillo D. Emsley J. Bankston L.A. Liddington R.C. Cruz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4205-4209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Integrin I domains undergo a large conformational change upon collagen binding that makes them particularly suited for signal transduction and modulation of ligand binding affinity (18Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 100: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (845) Google Scholar). In contrast, the VWF-A3 domain appears to function as an independent structural unit, and there is no evidence for modulation of its collagen binding affinity, nor does binding of A3 to collagen appear to affect the affinity of the VWF-A1 domain for platelet receptor GpIbα. Thus, the collagen-binding site of A3 merely performs an adhesive function, whereas binding sites of I domains are more sophisticated and also play a regulatory role (31Dickeson S.K. Mathis N.L. Rahman M. Bergelson J.M. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32182-32191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently, we determined the crystal structure of the VWF-A1 domain in complex with an amino-terminal fragment of platelet receptor GpIbα (11Huizinga E.G. Tsuji S. Romijn R.A.P. Schiphorst M.E. De Groot Ph. G. Sixma J.J. Gros P. Science. 2002; 297: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Like A3, the A1 domain does not contain a MIDAS motif. GpIbα binds to two distinct sites on A1. The larger of the two binding sites is located at the front face of A1 and consists of residues from strand β3, helix α3, and loop α3β4. Interestingly, the same structural elements contribute residues to the collagen-binding site of A3, suggesting that ligand-binding sites in A-type domains that lack a MIDAS motive may all be located in a similar position at the front face of the domain. Genetic screening has identified four mutations, S968T, Q971H, I978T, and Q999R, that affect binding of VWF to collagen (32Schneppenheim R. Obser T. Drewke E. Grosse-Wieltsch U. Oyen F. Sutor A.H.

Thromb Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These mutations are located at or just below the front surface of the domain, and their effect on collagen binding is consistent with our mutagenesis data. Surprisingly, these mutations caused no (32Schneppenheim R. Obser T. Drewke E. Grosse-Wieltsch U. Oyen F. Sutor A.H. Wermes C. Budde U. Blood. 2001; 98 (suppl.): 41aGoogle Scholar) or only moderate (33Ribba A.S. Loisel I. Lavergne J.M. Juhan-Vague I. Obert B. Cherel G. Meyer D. Girma J.P. Thromb Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) bleeding symptoms, which questioned the relevance of the A3 domain for immobilization of VWF to the vascular matrix (32Schneppenheim R. Obser T. Drewke E. Grosse-Wieltsch U. Oyen F. Sutor A.H. Wermes C. Budde U. Blood. 2001; 98 (suppl.): 41aGoogle Scholar). However, Wuet al. (34Wu D. Vanhoorelbeke K. Cauwenberghs N. Meiring M. Depraetere H. Kotze H.F. Deckmyn H. Blood. 2002; 99: 3623-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) recently showed that collagen binding by the A3 domain is relevant because an antibody blocking the VWF-A3-collagen interaction prevented the formation of platelet-rich thrombi and prolonged the skin bleeding time at high doses. Further investigations are required to reconcile these conflicting observations and to establish the physiological importance of VWF-A3 in platelet adhesion. After submission of this manuscript, Nishida et al. (35Nishida N. Sumikawa H. Sakakura M. Shimba N. Takahashi H. Terasawa H. Suzuki E.I. Shimada I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) reported mapping of the collagen-binding site of the VWF-A3 domain using a novel NMR technique. Their findings with regard to the location of the binding site and the orientation of a bound collagen triple helix are in complete agreement with our results. In summary, the binding site for collagen type III is located at the front face of the VWF-A3 domain. Residues in the lower half of the collagen-binding site are essential for collagen binding, whereas residues in the upper half contribute to binding but are not essential. We suggest that a collagen triple helix that interacts with A3 contains hydrophobic and positively charged residues. Further understanding of the VWF-collagen interaction requires the identification of specific collagen sequences involved in VWF binding."
https://openalex.org/W2010605796,"During purification of a recombinant MUC2 C terminus expressed in CHO-K1 cells, the protein was partly cleaved when buffers with a pH of 6.0 were used. When buffers with higher pH values were used, less cleavage was found. Disulfide bonds held the two fragments generated together as these were only observed after reduction. Edman sequencing of the C-terminal 110-kDa fragment revealed that the cleavage had occurred at an Asp-Pro bond, a site described previously to generate the so-called “link peptide” after disulfide bond reduction. In vitro studies on the conditions for cleavage showed that it occurred in a time-dependent manner at a pH below 6.0. Furthermore, the reaction was not enzyme-mediated as it occurred in pure preparations of the MUC2 C terminus and was not inhibited by protease inhibitors. When expressed in the mucin producing cell line LS 174T, the C terminus was cleaved to a higher extent compared with the CHO-K1 cells. Neutralizing the secretory pathway with either NH4Cl or bafilomycin A1 inhibited this cleavage. Altogether, our results suggest that the cleavage is an autocatalytic reaction that occurs in the acidic environment of the late secretory pathway. Furthermore, the cleavage produced a new, reactive C terminus that has the potential to attach the mucin to itself or other molecules. Because a pH below 6 can be reached in the late secretory pathway and on mucosal surfaces, the cleavage and possible cross-linking are likely to be of biological importance. During purification of a recombinant MUC2 C terminus expressed in CHO-K1 cells, the protein was partly cleaved when buffers with a pH of 6.0 were used. When buffers with higher pH values were used, less cleavage was found. Disulfide bonds held the two fragments generated together as these were only observed after reduction. Edman sequencing of the C-terminal 110-kDa fragment revealed that the cleavage had occurred at an Asp-Pro bond, a site described previously to generate the so-called “link peptide” after disulfide bond reduction. In vitro studies on the conditions for cleavage showed that it occurred in a time-dependent manner at a pH below 6.0. Furthermore, the reaction was not enzyme-mediated as it occurred in pure preparations of the MUC2 C terminus and was not inhibited by protease inhibitors. When expressed in the mucin producing cell line LS 174T, the C terminus was cleaved to a higher extent compared with the CHO-K1 cells. Neutralizing the secretory pathway with either NH4Cl or bafilomycin A1 inhibited this cleavage. Altogether, our results suggest that the cleavage is an autocatalytic reaction that occurs in the acidic environment of the late secretory pathway. Furthermore, the cleavage produced a new, reactive C terminus that has the potential to attach the mucin to itself or other molecules. Because a pH below 6 can be reached in the late secretory pathway and on mucosal surfaces, the cleavage and possible cross-linking are likely to be of biological importance. Mucins are large glycoproteins with the carbohydrates accounting for up to 90% of its molecular mass (1Forstner J.F. Oliver M.G. Sylvester F.A. Blaser M.J. Smith P.D. Ravdin J.I. Greenberg H.B.

These domains contain tandemly repeated sequences (rich in Ser, Thr, and Pro) that vary in number, length, and amino acid composition depending on the particular mucin (3Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Mucins account for the major part of the mucous layers covering the epithelial surfaces throughout the body, where they are believed to have several functions including protection and lubrication of the underlying epithelia. There are two major types of mucins, membrane-bound and secreted. In human, eight membrane-bound (MUC1, MUC3A, MUC3B, MUC4, MUC12, MUC13, MUC16, and MUC17) (4Gendler S. Lancaster C.

The secreted mucins can be further sub-divided as being either gel-forming (MUC2, MUC5B, MUC5AC, and MUC6) or not (MUC7). The ability to form gels is dependent on the capacity of monomers to form polymeric structures. The intermolecular interactions are of disulfide-bond nature and mediated through the N- and C-terminal Cys-rich domains of mucins (reviewed in Ref. 2Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

PSM has been shown to dimerize via its C-terminal domain in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (20Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34527-34534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In analogy with the results from the studies of PSM, we have reported previously (24Asker N. Baeckstrom D. Axelsson M.A. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Asker N. Axelsson M.A. Olofsson S.O. Hansson G.C. J. Biol.

These studies were made on the full-length MUC2, but due to the large size and high carbohydrate content of the mucins, it was hard to do further studies on its assembly by conventional methods. We have therefore expressed the last 981 amino acids of the human MUC2 mucin (corresponding to its C-terminal Cys-rich domain) as a fusion protein with the mycTag epitope and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) and in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line LS 174T. With this tool we could verify that the domain was capable of forming dimers and that these dimers were secreted from the cells. 2M. E. Lidell, M. E. V. Johansson, M. Mörgelin, N. Asker, C. J. R. Gum, Jr., Y. S. Kim, and G. C. Hansson, unpublished observations. These results were also supported by previous studies (26Bell S.L. Khatri I.A. Xu G. Forstner J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Bell S.L. Xu G. Forstner J.F. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) of the MUC2 homologue in rat (Muc2). In this study, we have studied a cleavage in the Cys-rich C-terminal part of MUC2. The cleavage was first observed during attempts to purify and study the glycosylation pattern of the recombinant C-terminal Cys-rich domain expressed in CHO-K1 cells. We found that when buffers of pH 6.0 were used during purification or glycosidase treatments, part of the material was cleaved. The cleavage caught our attention and was further analyzed, revealing that it was formed by an autocatalytic mechanism triggered by low pH. Furthermore, the cleavage produced a new, reactive C terminus that has the potential to link the cleaved mucin to other compounds. The polyclonal antiserum α-MUC2C2 has been described before (28Axelsson M.A.B. Asker N. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18864-18870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The α-mycTag monoclonal antibody (mAb) was from spent culture media of the 1-9E10.2 hybridoma (ATCC CRL-1729). Other antibodies used were α-GFP mAb (Clontech), goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins coupled to alkaline phosphatase (AP) (Dako), goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Dako), and streptavidin coupled to alkaline phosphatase (streptavidin-AP) (Dako). An expression plasmid with the bases 12,622–15,708 of the human MUC2 sequence (12Gum Jr., J. Hicks J. Toribara N. Siddiki B. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was generated from the plasmids SMUC41 (bases 12,243–13,083) and V5 (bases 12,880–15,708) (29Gum Jr., J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) where the signal sequence had been replaced with the murine immunoglobulin κ-chain signal sequence from pSecTag A (Invitrogen) followed by the mycTag (EQKLISEEDL).2 The resulting pSMG-MUC2C plasmid encoding the κ-chain signal sequence, the mycTag, GFP, and the MUC2 C terminus was sequenced and transfected into the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line LS 174T (ATCC CL-188) and Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO-K1 (ATCC CCL-61). Both cell lines were selected for permanent expression of the recombinant protein and named LS 174T-pSMG-MUC2C and CHO-K1-pSMG-MUC2C,2 respectively. These were cultured as described earlier (24Asker N. Baeckstrom D. Axelsson M.A. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) for LS 174T with the addition of 125 μg ml−1 G418 for LS 174T-pSMG-MUC2C and 250 μg ml−1 G418 for CHO-K1-pSMG-MUC2C, respectively. After growing CHO-K1-pSMG-MUC2C cells until 3–4 days after confluence, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) was added. The spent culture media were harvested, and new media were added every 3rd day. After the addition of protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Sigma), 100 μmleupeptin (Sigma), 100 KIE ml−1 aprotinin (Trasylol, Bayer), and 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide (NEM, Sigma)), the media was centrifuged 1,000 × g for 10 min (+4 °C), and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 was added. 200 ml of media were filtrated in an Amicon Stirred Cell model 8400 through an Amicon Ultrafiltration Membrane YM-100 (Millipore). The volume was reduced to 20 ml, filled up to 200 ml with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and reduced to 20 ml again. This procedure was repeated 3 times. The concentrate was filtered (0.22 μm Millex-GV, Millipore) and loaded on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) using a flow rate of 1.0 ml min−1. After washing with 150 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, bound components were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (150–600 mm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, over 45 min. The eluting components were monitored at 280 nm and collected in 1-ml fractions. The fractions were individually analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Seven column fractions, eluting between 230 and 300 mm NaCl, containing the recombinant MUC2 C terminus were pooled, concentrated to 200 μl by ultrafiltration (Vivaspin 2-ml concentrator, 30,000 molecular weight cut-off RC, 3000 ×g, 4 °C), loaded directly on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) eluted with 150 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.5, at a flow of 250 μl min−1. The eluting components were monitored at 280 nm and collected in 0.5-ml fractions. All the fractions contained in the symmetrical unimodal peak eluting atKav = 0.095 and positive for the recombinant MUC2 C terminus, as assessed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, were pooled and used for the subsequent studies. Confluent cells were metabolically labeled by preincubation in Met- and Cys-free minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 IU ml−1 penicillin, and 100 μg ml−1streptomycin for 1–2 h followed by addition of labeling mix (Redivue Pro-mix l-35S in vitro labeling mix,Amersham Biosciences) to a final concentration of 36–107 μCi ml−1. After incubation for 6–16 h, cell lysates and media were prepared. When pulse-chase studies were performed, the labeling mix was removed after 5 or 15 min and the cells washed once and chased with normal cell culturing media with excess of Met and Cys (15 and 25 μg extra/ml, respectively). Media were removed and the cells washed twice with PBS. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors and NEM (concentrations as above) and sonicated (intensity 15) 3 times for 2 s (MSE Soniprep 100 sonifier), and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min, 4 °C). The media were supplemented with protease inhibitors and NEM (concentrations as above) and centrifuged (1000 × gfor 10 min, 4 °C). Immunoprecipitations using the mAbs α-mycTag or α-GFP antibodies were performed by precoating these on goat anti-mouse IgG-coupled magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Dynal). The immunocomplexes were washed 4 times in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS (w/v), pH 7.4, and 1 time in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated material was released from the magnetic beads in sample buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2.5% (w/v) SDS, pH 6.8) with or without 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol or 100 mm dithiothreitol for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were analyzed by discontinuous SDS-PAGE using 3–10 or 3–15% gradient gels with 3% stacking gels or 5% linear gels with 3% stacking gels (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar). Coomassie Blue staining was performed according to the manufacturer (BioSafe Coomassie G-250, Bio-Rad). After analysis of metabolically labeled samples, the gels were fixed for 30 min in 30% methanol, 7% acetic acid, incubated in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 15 min, dried, and exposed to BioMax MS films (Eastman Kodak Co.). The molecular markers used were the High-Range Rainbow 14C-Methylated Protein Molecular Weight Markers (Amersham Biosciences) and Precision Protein Standards (Bio-Rad). Transfer of the proteins to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P, 0.45 μm, Millipore) was done in a Transfer-Blot SD-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad) at 2.5 mA/cm2. The transfer buffer used contained 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 1.3 mm SDS, and 10% (v/v) methanol. After blotting, the membranes were placed in blocking solution (PBS containing 5% (w/v) milk powder, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.05% (w/v) NaN3) overnight at 4 °C and incubated with either streptavidin-AP (diluted 1:1000) or the primary antibody α-mycTag mAb (diluted 1:10) or α-MUC2C2 (diluted 1:100) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS-T (PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and incubated with secondary antibodies (either goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins coupled to AP or goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins coupled to AP 1:1000 in blocking solution) for 1.5 h at room temperature. After another PBS-T wash (3 times for 5 min) the membranes were developed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. In the cases where biotin ethylenediamine hydrobromide were used (see below), another blocking solution was used (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.05% (w/v) NaN3). Nonlabeled material were immunoprecipitated with the α-mycTag mAb from CHO-K1-pSMG-MUC2C cell lysates and media, incubated in citric acid-Na2HPO4, pH 6.0, buffer (McIlvaine buffer) (2.5 h, 37 °C) while still attached to the beads, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western-blotted, and detected by immunostaining. The citric acid-Na2HPO4 buffer system used here, as well as below, is the one described by McIlvaine (31McIlvaine T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1921; 49: 183-186Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Radiolabeled and immunoprecipitated (α-mycTag mAb) material from CHO-K1-pSMG-MUC2C cell lysates or media was treated as described below while still attached to the magnetic beads. The pH dependence of the cleavage reaction was studied by incubating the radiolabeled material from cell lysates or media in citric acid-Na2HPO4 buffers (McIlvaine buffers) with pH from 4.8 to 7.8 for 20 min at 37 °C. Time dependence of the cleavage reaction was studied by incubating aliquots of the lysate material in a citric acid-Na2HPO4, pH 6.0 buffer (McIlvaine buffer), at 37 °C for 0–300 min. The influence of different protease inhibitors on the cleavage reaction was studied by incubating material from cell lysates for 1 h at 37 °C in 50 mmBisTris, pH 6.2 (pH 5.9 at 37 °C), containing one of the following inhibitors: PMSF (1 mm), bestatin (10 mm)(Sigma), leupeptin (100 μm), pepstatin (1 μm) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), aprotinin (2.15 μm), NEM (5 mm), EDTA (10 mm), or a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete mini-EDTA-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All incubations above were terminated by removal of the incubation buffers and addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer before analysis by SDS-PAGE. Confluent LS 174T-pSMG-MUC2C cells were used in these studies. When NH4Cl was used, the cells were preincubated with media with or without 25 mm NH4Cl for 12 h before the 1-h starvation and 8-h labeling period (both performed with 25 mm NH4Cl present). When bafilomycin A1 (a kind gift from AstraZeneca, Mölndal, Sweden) was used, it was present at 300 mm during the starvation (1 h) and labeling (6 h). The cell lysates and media were immunoprecipitated using the α-GFP antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Aliquots (114 ng) of purified recombinant MUC2 C terminus secreted from CHO-K1 cells were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature in either a citric acid-Na2HPO4, pH 7.4 buffer, a citric acid-Na2HPO4, pH 5.4 buffer, or in the latter containing 1 μmol of biotin ethylenediamine hydrobromide (Sigma). The incubations above were terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer before analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Purified C terminus was dried (using a SpeedVac concentrator), dissolved in 50 mm pyridine/acetic acid, pH 5.5 buffer, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The sample was dried, dissolved in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to a PVDF membrane, and stained with Coomassie Blue (BioSafe Coomassie G-250, Bio-Rad) for 1 h. The membrane was destained in 50% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid, and the band corresponding to the C-terminal cleavage fragment was cut out and sequenced on a Procise 492 Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The cell line CHO-K1-pSMG-MUC2C permanently expressed a construct encoding the mycTag epitope at the N-terminal end followed by GFP and the last 981 amino acids of the human MUC2 mucin. The murine immunoglobulin κ-chain signal sequence was used to direct the fusion protein to the secretory pathway. The recombinant MUC2 C terminus (SMG-MUC2C) formed dimers in the ER (with a molecular mass of about 330 kDa) and was later secreted as dimers of higher molecular mass (about 470 kDa), a difference partly due to glycosylation.2 These cells were grown in the presence of 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and the secreted fusion protein was purified by ultrafiltration, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography using a 50 mmBisTris, pH 6.0 buffer. The purified SMG-MUC2C was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions revealing a single band with an approximate molecular mass of 470 kDa, corresponding to the size of a dimer (Fig. 1). When the same material was analyzed under reducing conditions, three bands were observed (Fig.1). The largest band corresponded to the expected monomer with an approximated molecular mass of about 250 kDa. The two additional bands migrated at about 130 and 110 kDa, suggesting that these could be due to a cleavage of the full-length SMG-MUC2C. Western blot analysis of the nonreduced band revealed that this was immunoreactive with both the α-mycTag mAb and the α-MUC2C2 antiserum (Fig.2A). This was also true for the 250-kDa monomer found after reduction. The 130-kDa band only reacted with the mycTag mAb, whereas the 110-kDa band reacted with the α-MUC2C2 antiserum raised against a peptide sequence in the C-terminal end of MUC2. The results indicated that some of the SMG-MUC2C had been cleaved, producing a 130-kDa N-terminal and a 110-kDa C-terminal fragment, and that these fragments were still held together by disulfide bonds.Figure 2Identification of the cleavage products of the MUC2 C terminus. A, MUC2 C terminus, secreted from CHO-K1-pSMG-MUC2C cells and purified using a pH 6.0 buffer, was separated on a 3–10% SDS-PAGE gel, blotted, and detected with either α-MUC2C2 antiserum or α-mycTag mAb. B, cell lysates and media from CHO-K1-pSMG-MUC2C cells were immunoprecipitated (using the α-mycTag mAb), incubated for 2.5 h in a citric acid-Na2HPO4, pH 6.0 buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE (3–10%, reducing conditions), blotted, and detected by either the α-MUC2C2 antiserum or the α-mycTag mAb.

When the samples were treated in the pH 7.0 buffer, only the intact protein band was observed. However, when the samples were treated in the pH 6.0 buffer, the two cleavage products appeared (data not shown). These observations of a cleavage occurring only when the sample had been treated at pH 6.0 led to the hypothesis that this reaction was induced at low pH. Purification of secreted MUC2 C terminus from CHO-K1-pSMG-MUC2C cells grown under serum-free conditions, using ultrafiltration, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration with buffers having a pH ≥ 8.0, gave rise to a much lower extent of cleavage (Fig. 1), further supporting this hypothesis. Purified SMG-MUC2C, from spent culture media, was incubated at pH 5.5 overnight. After separation by SDS-PAGE and transfer to a PVDF membrane, the 110-kDa band corresponding to the C-terminal cleavage fragment was excised and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The sequence obtained, PHYVTF, is located at a position compatible with the sizes of the two cleaved fragments (see Fig. 1). The localization of this cleavage corresponds to the N-terminal end of the previously found 118-kDa “link peptide” (32Fahim R.E. Forstner G.G. Forstner J.F. Biochem.

To decipher the identity of the cleavage products produced in the in vitrostudies, immunoprecipitated material from CHO-K1-pSMG-MUC2C cell lysates and media was incubated at pH 6.0 and further analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunodetection (Fig. 2B). The results showed that the N-terminal cleavage product migrated as ∼50 kDa heavier after its secretion (130 relative to 80 kDa,left panel), whereas the C-terminal fragment only acquired around 10 kDa after its secretion (110 relative to 100 kDa, right panel). This caused the two bands to switch position relative to the intact SMG-C monomer, when comparing cell lysate and media. This implies that the modifications, leading to a secreted SMG-MUC2C with lower mobility compared with the intracellular form, mainly are present in the N-terminal part of the protein. To test the hypothesis of a pH-dependent cleavage, radiolabeled material from CHO-K1-pSMG-MUC2C cell lysates and media was immunoprecipitated using α-mycTag antibodies coupled to magnetic beads. While still attached to the beads, aliquots of the material were treated under different conditions, and the labeled SMG-MUC2C was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To investigate if the cleavage was induced at a low pH, aliquots of immunoprecipitated SMG-MUC2C from cell lysate and media were treated in citric acid-Na2HPO4 buffers with pH from 4.8 to 7.8 for 20 min at 37 °C (Fig. 3,A and B). The cleavage was observed at a pH around 6.0 and lower for both the intracellular and extracellular forms of SMG-MUC2C. The cleavage products could be observed as weak bands also at pH >6.0 in the secreted but not the intracellular form of SMG-MUC2C. This indicated that the cleavage could occur prior to the incubation and probably inside the cell. The intracellular SMG-MUC2C has been localized to the ER,2 and thus this form has not passed through the more acidic parts of the late secretory pathway. The presence of some cleavage of the secreted SMG-MUC2C suggested that this process occurred late in the secretory pathway. To investigate if the cleavage reaction was time-dependent, aliquots of immunoprecipitated SMG-MUC2C from cell lysate were incubated in a pH 6.0 buffer for different times (0–300 min) (Fig.3C). The result from this experiment showed that cleavage was time-dependent as an increased amount of the cleavage products was observed with longer incubation times. However, cleavage was not complete even after 5 h. To explore if the cleavage was mediated by a protease, aliquots of immunoprecipitated SMG-MUC2C from cell lysate were treated in a BisTris buffer, pH 6.2 (gives pH 5.9 at 37 °C), with the addition of protease inhibitors (Fig. 4). A wide range of protease inhibitors including Ser, Cys, aspartic, and metalloprotease inhibitors as well as an aminopeptidase inhibitor were used. None of these inhibited the cleavage reaction to a significant extent. This argues for the cleavage not being mediated by an enzyme tightly attached to or being an integral part of the MUC2 C terminus itself. The level of cleavage in the secreted material from the CHO-K1-pSMG-MUC2C cells was v"
https://openalex.org/W2121047497,"Abstract myo-Inositol (Ins) and its polyphosphoinositide derivatives that are important in membrane signaling have long been held to play a special role in brain metabolism. As polyphosphoinositides turn over rapidly and are exceptionally abundant in nervous tissue, high Ins levels in the range of 2–15 mm that have been observed in brain may be necessary to maintain the rates of phosphoinositide synthesis in diverse membrane locations within neurons. Cellular concentration gradients of this magnitude indicate a dependence on active Ins transport, especially at the time of growth and differentiation. The Na+/myo-inositol cotransporter (SMIT1 or SLC5A3) gene is highly expressed prenatally in the central nervous system and placenta. To gain more insight into brain Ins metabolism, while ascertaining the importance of SMIT1 as a transporter, we generated mice with a homozygous targeted deletion of this gene. Newborn SMIT1(−/−) animals have no evidence of SMIT1 mRNA, a 92% reduction in the level of brain Ins, an 84% reduction in whole body Ins, and expire shortly after birth due to hypoventilation. Gross pathologic and light microscopic examinations of each organ, as well as the placenta, of embryonic day 18.5 fetuses at near term gestation were normal. Based on [3H]acetate incorporation into phospholipids of lung tissue explants, immunostaining of lung tissue for surfactant protein A, B, and C, and electron microscopic examination of alveolar cells, there was no evidence of abnormal pulmonary surfactant production by type 2 pneumocytes in lung. Although no histologic lesions were detected in the nervous system, electrophysiological studies of the brainstem pre-Botzinger respiratory control center demonstrated an abnormal rhythm discharge with periods of central apnea. The cause of death can be explained by the regulatory defect in brainstem control of ventilation. This model demonstrates the critical importance ofSMIT1 in the developing nervous system. The high affinity SMIT1 transporter is responsible for the Ins concentration gradient in the murine fetal-placental unit."

Exposure of cells to insulin inhibited the activation of MEKK1 by GSK3β, and this inhibitory effect of insulin was abolished by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Furthermore, MEKK1 activity under either basal or UV- or tumor necrosis factor α-stimulated conditions was reduced in embryonic fibroblasts derived from GSK3β knockout mice compared with that in such cells from wild-type mice.

An activated MAPK kinase kinase phosphorylates serine or threonine residues of a MAPK kinase, which in turn phosphorylates and thereby activates a MAPK (16Davis R.J.

The mammalian family of MAPKs includes at least three subgroups, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), also known as stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), and p38 MAPK (17Ip Y.T.

To provide further insight into the regulatory role of GSK3β in intracellular signaling cascades, we have now investigated the effect of this enzyme on the JNK/SAPK pathway. We show that GSK3β physically associates with and activates MEKK1, thereby stimulating the JNK/SAPK pathway. The PI3K-Akt signaling inhibited the GSK3β-induced activation of MEKK1. Furthermore, the activity of endogenous MEKK1 was reduced in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from GSK3β knockout (GSK3β−/−) mice compared with that in MEFs from GSK3β+/+ mice. These findings suggest that GSK3β functions as an endogenous activator of MEKK1. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to GSK3β and to axin as well as rabbit polyclonal antibodies against MEKK1 and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal antibody to JNK1 was from BD Pharmingen. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to the hemagglutinin epitope (HA) and to the FLAG epitope were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Stratagene, respectively. MEKK1 constructs used were prepared as described previously (28Kim J.W. Joe C.O. Choi E.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27064-27070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). GSK3β, GSK3β(K85A), and GSK3β(S9A) cDNAs were isolated by the polymerase chain reaction using primers (5′-GCGGAATTCATGTCAGGGCGGCCCAGA-3′ and 5′-CGCCTCGAGGGTGGAGTTGGAAGCTGATGC-3′) and cloned into pCMV5-FLAG (Eastman Kodak Co.). cDNAs for GSK3β deletion mutants (NT, CEN, ΔN, and ΔC) were made by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3-HA (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) and rat neuroblastoma B103 cells were maintained under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were transiently transfected with the use of GenePORTER II (Gene Therapy Systems), by the calcium phosphate method, or by electroporation. B103 cells were transfected for 48 h with pEGFP (Clontech) and the appropriate vector constructs, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and then stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (10 μg/ml) for 10 min. The 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained nuclei of cells expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) were examined for apoptotic morphology with a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope. The percentage of apoptotic cell death was determined as the number of GFP-expressing cells with apoptotic nuclei divided by the total number of GFP-expressing cells. More than 200 cells were counted in each experiment. Cells were lysed in buffer A consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmsodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 12 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibodies. The resulting precipitates were washed four times with buffer A and then examined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Cells were lysed in buffer A, and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above. The resulting immunoprecipitates were assayed for enzymatic activities of the indicated protein kinases as described previously (29Kim J.W. Chang T.S. Lee J.E. Huh S.H. Yeon S.W. Yang W.S. Joe C.O.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the extent of phosphorylation was quantified with a Fuji BAS2500 imager. Bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of c-Jun-(1–79), SAPKβ(K55R), SEK1(K129R), and β-catenin were used as substrates for JNK/SAPK, SEK1, MEKK1, and GSK3β, respectively. GSK3β and its variants were translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine with the use of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The resulting 35S-labeled GSK3β proteins were then incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins of MEKK1 variants in a solution containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The GST fusion proteins were recovered with the use of glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were then washed three times with washing buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20). The associated35S-labeled proteins were eluted from the beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To investigate the possible effect of GSK3β on the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway, we first transfected HEK293 cells with plasmid encoding HA-tagged SAPKβ either alone or together with a vector for FLAG epitope-tagged GSK3β or GSK3β(K85A). Exposure of the transfected cells to UV resulted in activation of the recombinant SAPKβ (Fig.1A). This effect of UV irradiation was enhanced by ectopic expression of GSK3β but not by that of the mutant GSK3β(K85A), which is catalytically inactive (31Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Rather, GSK3β(K85A) inhibited the UV-induced activation of SAPKβ. Whereas overexpressed GSK3β also increased the basal activity of SAPKβ, it did not enhance either the basal activity or the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (Fig. 1A). We next examined whether GSK3β affects the activities of SEK1 and MEKK1, which function as MAPK kinase and MAPK kinase kinase of JNK/SAPK, respectively. Overexpressed GSK3β increased in both the basal and UV-stimulated activities of SEK1 and MEKK1 (Fig.1, B and C). In contrast, GSK3β did not increase the activity of ASK1 (data not shown), which also functions as a MAPK kinase kinase of JNK/SAPK (32Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the GSK3β-induced activation of JNK1/SAPKγ was inhibited by expression of MEKK1(K1253M) (Fig. 1D), a catalytically inactive mutant of MEKK1, but not by ASK1(K709R), a kinase-inactive mutant of ASK1. Collectively, these results suggest that GSK3β induces the activation of MEKK1, thereby triggering JNK/SAPK activation. We then examined the possible effect of GBP, an intracellular inhibitor of GSK3β (7Yost C. Farr III, G.H. Pierce S.B. Ferkey D.M. Chen M.M. Kimelman D. Cell. 1998; 93: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), on the activation of MEKK1 by GSK3β. Overexpressed GBP inhibited the GSK3β-induced increase in MEKK1 activity (Fig.2A). Furthermore, exposure of HEK293 cells to LiCl, which functions as an inhibitor of GSK3β (33Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar,34Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in the activities of endogenous JNK1 and MEKK1 (Fig. 2B). Axin, a GSK3β-regulated scaffolding protein (4Woodgett J.R. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/100/re12)PubMed Google Scholar), has been shown to activate MEKK1 through a direct protein-protein interaction (35Zhang Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, axin interacts with both GSK3β and MEKK1, implying that it might function as a molecular linker for MEKK1 and GSK3β (36Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether axin mediates the GSK3β-induced activation of MEKK1. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with an HA-MEKK1 vector and various combinations of GSK3β-FLAG, axin1, and axin1Δ-(217–353) constructs, and then cell lysates were examined for MEKK1 activity. Axin1Δ-(217–353), which lacks the MEKK1-interacting domain, exerts a dominant-negative effect on axin-induced MEKK1 activation (36Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Overexpression of either GSK3β or axin1 induced MEKK1 activation in HEK293 cells, and these effects of GSK3β and axin1 were additive (Fig. 3). Whereas axin1Δ-(217–353) inhibited the activation of MEKK1 by axin1, it did not affect that induced by GSK3β. These data suggest that GSK3β induces MEKK1 activation in an axin-independent manner. We next investigated whether GSK3β interacts with MEKK1 in intact cells. HEK293 cells were transfected with a GSK3β-FLAG vector either alone or together with vectors for HA-MEKK1 or HA-axin1. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed the presence of HA-MEKK1 in GSK3β-FLAG immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4A). HA-axin1 also associated with GSK3β-FLAG, but it did not affect the extent of the physical interaction between GSK3β-FLAG and HA-MEKK1. Similar analysis of non-transfected cells with antibodies to GSK3β and to MEKK1 also revealed an interaction of the two endogenous proteins (Fig.4B). This interaction was not markedly affected by exposure of the cells to UV radiation. In comparison, endogenous GSK3β did not interact with endogenous ASK1. Next, we examined whether GSK3β interacts directly with MEKK1in vitro. In vitro translated35S-labeled GSK3β was incubated with GST-MEKK1 fusion proteins, and an interaction between the two proteins was examined by GST pull-down analysis. 35S-Labeled GSK3β bound to MEKK1-N1 (amino acids 1–401 of MEKK1) and MEKK1-N2 (amino acids 402–821) but not to MEKK1-ΔNC (amino acids 822–1172) or ΔMEKK1 (amino acids 1173–1493) (Fig.5A). The ΔMEKK1 mutant is a constitutively active form of MEKK1. In a separate in vitrobinding analysis with GST-MEKK1-N1 and 35S-labeled GSK3β variants, MEKK1-N1 bound to full-length GSK3β, GSK3β-NT (amino acids 1–150), and GSK3β-ΔC (amino acids 1–300), but not to GSK3β-CEN (amino acids 151–300) or GSK3β-ΔN (amino acids 151–420) (Fig. 5B). These results thus suggest that the NH2-terminal region that contains amino acids 1–150 of GSK3β is required for binding to MEKK1. Neither GST-MEKK1-ΔNC nor GST-ΔMEKK1 interacted with the various GSK3β deletion mutants (data not shown). GSK3β phosphorylated both MEKK1 and the kinase-inactive mutant MEKK1(K1253M) in vitro, and these phosphorylation reactions were inhibited by LiCl (Fig. 5C). LiCl also inhibited the autophosphorylation of GSK3b. Akt phosphorylates GSK3β on Ser9 and thereby inactivates this enzyme (4Woodgett J.R. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/100/re12)PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M.

We therefore examined whether Akt negatively regulates the activation of MEKK1 by GSK3β. HEK293 cells were transfected with an HA-MEKK1 vector either alone or together with various combinations of vectors for GSK3β-FLAG, GSK3β(S9A)-FLAG, Akt-CA, and Akt(K179A). Akt-CA is a myristoylated form of Akt that is constitutively active (37Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), and Akt(K179A) is a kinase-inactive mutant of Akt. Ectopic GSK3β induced MEKK1 activation in the transfected cells, and this activation was inhibited by Akt-CA but not by Akt(K179A) (Fig. 6A). In contrast, Akt-CA failed to inhibit MEKK1 activation induced by GSK3β(S9A), which is resistant to the Akt-mediated phosphorylation as a result of the substitution of Ser9 with Ala. Insulin initiates the activation of PI3K that in turn induces Akt activation (38Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 39Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar, 40Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). We thus investigated whether insulin is also able to block the GSK3β-induced activation of MEKK1. The activation of MEKK1 by GSK3β in transfected HEK293 cells was inhibited by an exposure of the cells to insulin (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of insulin was abolished by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. These results suggest that the insulin-activated PI3K negatively regulates the activation of MEKK1 by GSK3β. GSK3β has been shown to induce cell death in several studies (31Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 41Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Persistent activation of MEKK1 also induces apoptosis (42Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 43Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Diener K.M. Lange-Carter C.A. Gleavy J. Jarpe M.B. Minden A. Karin M. Zon L.I. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3229-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possibility that MEKK1 activation mediates apoptosis induced by GSK3β. Neuroblastoma B103 cells were transiently transfected with vectors encoding GSK3β or GSK3β(S9A) in the absence or presence of a vector for the dominant-negative mutant MEKK1(K1253M), after which the cells were examined for apoptosis (Fig. 7). Overexpressed GSK3β or GSK3β(S9A) increased apoptosis in the transfected cells, and co-expression of MEKK1(K1253M) inhibited this effect. These results thus suggest that activation of MEKK1 contributes to the induction of apoptosis by GSK3β. Insulin blocked the induction of apoptosis by GSK3β but not that by the Akt-resistant mutant GSK3β(S9A). To confirm the biological relevance of GSK3β-induced MEKK1 activation, we examined the basal, UV-stimulated, and TNFα-stimulated activities of MEKK1 in MEFs derived from GSK3β+/+ and GSK3β−/− mice (Fig.8A). The MEKK1 activities under all three conditions were higher in MEFGSK3β(+/+)than MEFGSK3β(−/−). Furthermore, ectopic expression of GSK3β increased both the basal and TNFα-stimulated activities of MEKK1 in MEFGSK3β(−/−) (Fig. 8B). In comparison, expression of the kinase-inactive mutant GSK3β(K85A) did not affect the basal or TNFα-stimulated activities of MEKK1 in MEFGSK3β(−/−). These data thus suggest that GSK3β functions as a natural activator of MEKK1. We have shown that GSK3β physically interacts with and activates MEKK1, thereby triggering the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway. Insulin-activated PI3K and Akt inhibited the GSK3β-induced activation of MEKK1. Furthermore, MEKK1 activity was reduced in MEFs from GSK3β−/− mice compared with that in MEFs from wild-type animals, and forced expression of GSK3β increased MEKK1 activity in the cells from GSK3β−/− mice. Our data thus indicate that GSK3β is an activator of MEKK1. Axin, a GSK3β-interacting protein, was also recently shown to interact directly with and to activate MEKK1 (36Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It implies that axin might mediate the activation of MEKK1 by GSK3β. Our results, however, indicate that GSK3β physically associates with and activates MEKK1 in a manner independent of axin. MEKK1 is activated as a result of phosphorylation by upstream kinases or through binding to oligomeric forms of upstream regulators such as TNF receptor associated factor 2 (44Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 45Schlesinger T.K. Fanger G.R. Yujiri T. Johnson G.L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 1181-1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GSK3β might thus induce the activation of MEKK1 by phosphorylation given that MEKK1 contains several potential sites for GSK3β-catalyzed phosphorylation. Indeed, the kinase-inactive mutant GSK3β(K85A) failed to activate MEKK1. Moreover, GSK3β phosphorylated MEKK1 in vitro. Further studies are needed to identify a phosphorylation site(s) in MEKK1 targeted by GSK3β. We cannot also exclude the possibility that the physical interaction between GSK3β and MEKK1 induces the activation of MEKK1 through a mechanism independent of protein phosphorylation. In this study we demonstrate that insulin inhibited the activation of MEKK1 by GSK3β and that this effect of insulin was abolished by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. Furthermore, Akt inhibited GSK3β-induced MEKK1 activation. These observations thus suggest that PI3K and Akt modulate the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway through inhibition of GSK3β-induced MEKK1 activation. Many lines of evidence have previously demonstrated PI3K and Akt as negative regulators of the JNK/SAPK cascade (46Cerezo A. Martinez-A C. Lanzarot D. Fischer S. Franke T.F. Rebollo A. Mol. Biol.

Thus, PI3K and Akt appear to tightly regulate the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway by means of multiple mechanisms. GSK3β is implicated in many biological events, including signaling activated by Wnt and glycogen metabolism (4Woodgett J.R. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/100/re12)PubMed Google Scholar). GSK3β-deficient mice, however, do not exhibit any marked alterations in the Wnt-induced embryonic development or glycogen metabolism (51Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB by TNF-α is impaired in MEFs from GSK3β-deficient mice (51Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). We now show that MEKK1 activity under either basal or UV- or TNF-α-stimulated condition is reduced in MEFs from GSK3β-deficient mice compared with that in MEFs from wild-type mice, consistent with the notion that GSK3β potentiates the function of MEKK1. Thus, our results demonstrate that GSK3β is an endogenous activator of MEKK1. This function of GSK3β may be an important aspect of the mechanism by which this enzyme modulates intracellular signaling, including that triggered by cellular stress. We thank Dr. J. W.

We have shown previously that promoter 1 of the LEF1 gene is activated by T cell factor (TCF)-β-catenin complexes in transient transfection assays, suggesting that LEF1 is a target of the Wnt pathway in colon cancer. To further explore the link between LEF1 expression and the Wnt pathway, we studied two response elements in the promoter. Surprisingly we found that theLEF1 promoter is selectively activated by specific isoforms of the LEF/TCF transcription factor family that contain an alternative C-terminal “E” tail. These isoforms, TCF-1E and TCF-4E, activate the promoter in a β-catenin-dependent manner. We show that a complete E-tail domain is necessary for full activity and delimits residues within two highly conserved peptide motifs within the tail that are required (KKCRARFG; WCXXCRRKKKC). These peptide motifs are not only conserved among the TCF family members but are also found in two newly identified DNA-binding proteins named papillomavirus binding factor and GLUT4 enhancer factor.

High levels of β-catenin cause an increase in the formation of LEF/TCF-β-catenin complexes in the nucleus, which leads to inappropriate activation of Wnt target genes. This is proposed to be a key component of Wnt-linked carcinogenesis.Some of the Wnt target genes encode components of the Wnt signal transduction pathway, and their increased expression may have inhibitory or facilitatory effects on Wnt signaling (13Yu X.

Dyn. 1998; 213: 440-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For example, although it is not expressed in the normal adult colon, theLEF1 gene is aberrantly expressed in the majority of sporadic colon cancers, in which Wnt signaling is constitutive (20Hovanes K. Li T.W. Munguia J.E. Truong T. Milovanovic T. Lawrence Marsh J. Holcombe R.F. Waterman M.L. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 53-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the underlying mechanism of aberrant LEF1expression is not fully understood, only the promoter for full-length forms of LEF-1 is activated. A second intronic promoter that produces dominant negative forms of LEF-1 remains silent. We have shown that the promoter for full-length LEF-1 is likely to be a Wnt target gene, because it is activated by TCF-1-β-catenin and TCF-4-β-catenin complexes and is sensitive to cellular levels of β-catenin. Inappropriate LEF1 expression may contribute to increased Wnt signal strength by increasing the concentration of LEF/TCF-β-catenin complexes in the nucleus, and such increases appear to be Wnt pathway-directed. We show in this study that the promoter for full-length LEF-1 is activated by β-catenin through two Wnt response elements, but surprisingly this occurs only when β-catenin is recruited by a specific TCF isoform that contains an alternative C-terminal tail referred to as the E-tail.E-tail isoforms of TCF-1, TCF-3, and TCF-4 are generated from alternative splicing at the 3′-end of the pre-mRNA to encode a longer alternative C-terminal region (21van de Wetering M. Castrop J. Korinek V. Clevers H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 22Hovanes K. Li T.W.H. Waterman M.L.

The LEF1locus does not produce an E-tail isoform, because it is missing an E-tail-specific exon. Instead, the most abundant isoform of LEF-1 carries an “N”-tail. Neither the expression pattern nor the function of TCF E-tail isoforms is very well characterized except that they are detected as one of the most abundant isoforms in cell lines, and the TCF-4E and TCF-3 E-tails are able to bind CtBP, a transcription repressor. We show here for the first time that the E-tail of TCF-1 carries a novel transcription-activating function with respect to theLEF1 promoter. This activity is not present in TCF-3E or LEF-1N but remains dependent on β-catenin recruitment.DISCUSSIONWe have described a new activity of the E-tail isoform of TCF-1 that enables β-catenin to activate transcription of theLEF1 promoter in transient transfection assays. The E-tail isoform of TCF-4 is also able to activate the LEF1 promoter (shown previously in Ref. 20Hovanes K. Li T.W. Munguia J.E. Truong T. Milovanovic T. Lawrence Marsh J. Holcombe R.F. Waterman M.L. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 53-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other isoforms of TCF-1 as well as LEF-1N and the disparate E-tail isoform of TCF-3 do not function with β-catenin at this promoter. This is true despite the fact that all LEF/TCF isoforms are equally active with the standard TOPFLASH reporter plasmid. These data suggest that expression of the LEF1locus may be particularly sensitive to regulation by β-catenin complexes containing TCF-E-tail isoforms. Such forms are detected in colon cancer cell lines that aberrantly express LEF1 (23Duval A. Rolland S. Tubacher E. Bui H. Thomas G. Hamelin R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3872-3879PubMed Google Scholar,27Mayer K. Hieronymus T. Castrop J. Clevers H. Ballhausen W. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Several possible mechanisms may enable activation of theLEF1 promoter by the E-tail. Such possibilities include the location of response elements relative to the start site of transcription, regulation of different types of basal promoters, differences in DNA sequence recognition, or interactions with other regulatory proteins. The first two possible mechanisms, the downstream location of the Wnt response elements or the type of basal promoter, are unlikely to affect activation because movement of the response elements to a position 5′ of the start site of transcription of the heterologous TATA-containing Herpesvirus TK promoter does not change the patterns of activity that we observed (Fig. 5). We conclude that the E-tail activity is not likely to subserve promoter-specific or location-specific regulation. The third mechanism, conformation of DNA sequence recognition or affinity, remains a possibility because the DNase I footprinting experiments with recombinant LEF-1N and TCF-1E protein show minor differences in DNaseI hypersensitivities (Fig. 4). Difficulties with the purification of full-length TCF-1E have prevented us from directly comparing DNA-binding affinities with LEF-1N protein. However, to address whether different DNA binding affinities could account for the disparate activities of TCF-1E and LEF-1N, we created a mutantLEF1 promoter reporter plasmid in which the sequences of the two Wnt response elements at +190 and +283 were changed to the high affinity LEF/TCF response sequences present in the TOPFLASH reporter plasmid. Again only TCF-1E was able to work with β-catenin to activate this reporter. 4F. A. Atcha, data not shown. Thus if the E-tail modifies DNA sequence affinity, such differences may only be revealed with reporters containing one or two separated response elements and not the closely apposed multiple elements that are found in the TOPFLASH reporter. Current efforts are under way to more carefully analyze DNA binding affinity, DNA bending, and protein-DNA conformations of the LEF1 promoter response sites by LEF-1N and TCF-1E. A fourth possible mechanism involves the engagement of E-tail motifs in protein interactions as opposed to direct DNA binding. The absolute conservation of the cysteine residues in each motif among TCF orthologs suggests a cysteine-based tertiary structure but not one that matches any known metal-chelating domain (Fig. 2 B). Co-activators of transcription are obvious candidates if protein interaction is involved, but one direct possibility could be that the E-tail enables a better and more stable interaction with β-catenin. This possibility is unlikely, given that CR1mt and CR2mt are as active as wild type TCF-1E for β-catenin-dependent activation of TOPFLASH and that LEF/TCFs without an E-tail efficiently co-immunoprecipitate with β-catenin in COS-7 cells (28Prieve M.G.

However, multimerized response elements may mask differences between family members in their ability to recruit β-catenin to target promoters, and only careful assessment of β-catenin-binding affinities to DNA-bound LEF/TCFs can resolve this issue. If co-regulators are recruited through interactions with the E-tail domain, then such regulators are most likely to be ubiquitously expressed, because we have observed E-tail-specific activation of theLEF1 promoter in different cell types including mature and immature human T lymphocyte lines (Jurkat and 2017) and COS-1 cells, a monkey kidney cell line. 5F. A. Atcha, unpublished observation. If the E-tail modifies target gene recognition through nucleic acid interactions or protein interactions, it does so via a novel independent mechanism with the CR1 and CR2 motifs playing an important role. The TCF-1 E-tail is a 137-amino acid domain, and for most of this domain, there is little sequence conservation with other TCF E-tails. The exception is the high level of sequence conservation in the most N-terminal part centered over the CR motifs (Fig. 2 B). The CR1 and CR2 peptide motifs of 10 and 15 amino acids, respectively, show the highest conservation between TCF-1 and TCF-4, with TCF-3 having the greatest sequence variance and missing the 9 amino acid CR1 motif completely (Fig. 2 B). Drosophila TCF and theCaenorhabditis elegans ortholog, Pop-1, have nearly identical CR1 and CR2 motifs. We have introduced amino acid substitution mutations in CR1 and CR2, and E-tail activity is abolished in our assays (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, van de Weteringet al. (4van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J. Loureiro J. Ypma A. Hursh D. Jones T. Bejsovec A. Peifer M. Mortin M. Clevers H.

This mutant allele, dTCF1, carries a single alanine-to-valine substitution in the CR1 motif, underscoring the functional importance of this region.Although a detailed understanding of the function of the CR region (also referred to as the CRAR region (3van Noort M. Clevers H. Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar)) is lacking, its activities are likely to be independent and not intrinsically associated with LEF/TCF proteins only. A search of GenBankTM proteins containing similar CR1 and CR2 motifs identified two additional DNA-binding proteins (Fig. 2 B). The first, a 513-amino acid protein called papillomavirus regulatory factor (Prf-1) and papillomavirus binding factor (PBF) was identified in a yeast one-hybrid assay for cellular proteins binding to the E2 binding site, P2, of human papillomavirus type 8 (29Boeckle S. Pfister H. Steger G. Virology. 2002; 293: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The second factor, GLUT4-enhancer factor (G4EF), is highly similar to Prf-1/PBF and was identified as a 387-amino acid DNA-binding protein that recognizes the enhancer for the human GLUT4 transporter gene (30Oshel K.M. Knight J.B. Cao K.T. Thai M.V. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23666-23673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). On the basis of aCX4 C-X12 H-X4 Hsequence in the middle portion of each protein, both Prf-1/PBF and G4EF are proposed to contain a TFIIIA-like zinc finger DNA-binding domain. Indeed Prf-1/PBF has been shown to bind specifically to DNA sequences with CCGG at the core (29Boeckle S. Pfister H. Steger G. Virology. 2002; 293: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Unlike the closely juxtaposed high mobility group DNA-binding domain and CR1/2motifs of the TCFs, the homologous CR1/2 motifs in Prf-1/PBF lie at the extreme C-terminal end of the protein, 139 residues away from the putative zinc finger DNA-binding domain. Thus, if CR1/2 motifs influence DNA binding for all these different proteins, they must do so as independent and auxiliary motifs able to cope with variable placement relative to different types of DNA-binding domains.The results that we report in this study support the intriguing possibility that not all LEF/TCFs are functionally equivalent and that different isoforms may preferentially regulate different subsets of Wnt target genes. Such a possibility is consistent with genetic data from knock-out and transgenic mice experiments in which the removal of theLEF1 gene or TCF1 gene generated partially non-redundant phenotypes in tissues where their expression patterns overlapped or where overexpression of dominant negative forms of LEF/TCFs produced non-identical phenotypes (31Okamura R.

Whether a portion of these non-redundant activities is a result of the expression of E-tail isoforms and whether such specialized functions play a role in tumor development are unknowns that are important to address if we are to understand the role that Wnt signals play in promoting cancer. Wnt ligand-Frizzled receptor interactions at the plasma membrane trigger a cytoplasmic signal transduction cascade that propagates to the nucleus via the stabilization and release of cytoplasmic β-catenin, an armadillo repeat protein with nuclear import/export capabilities (reviewed most recently in Refs. 1Moon R.T.

Nuclear-localized β-catenin forms a transcription regulatory complex with any member of the lymphoid enhancer factor/T cell factor family (LEF/TCF)2 (LEF-1, TCF-1, TCF-3, and TCF-4) (reviewed recently in Ref. 3van Noort M. Clevers H. Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). All four LEF/TCFs bind to Wnt target genes through their high mobility group DNA-binding domains and position a potent regulatory domain within β-catenin to activate transcription (4van de Wetering M.

When Wnt signals operate properly, the changes in gene expression direct cells to adopt specific cell fates and differentiate or to grow and divide (reviewed in Refs.3van Noort M. Clevers H. Dev.

Unregulated constitutive Wnt signaling, which is enabled by mutations in cytoplasmic Wnt signaling components, is thought to be an initiating event for many types of cancer, including colon cancer (5Bienz M.

The most common mutations in colon cancer, truncation mutations of adenomatous polyposis coli, disallow β-catenin degradation and increase the concentration of β-catenin protein in cells (9Polakis P.

High levels of β-catenin cause an increase in the formation of LEF/TCF-β-catenin complexes in the nucleus, which leads to inappropriate activation of Wnt target genes. This is proposed to be a key component of Wnt-linked carcinogenesis. Some of the Wnt target genes encode components of the Wnt signal transduction pathway, and their increased expression may have inhibitory or facilitatory effects on Wnt signaling (13Yu X. Riese J.

Dyn. 1998; 213: 440-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For example, although it is not expressed in the normal adult colon, theLEF1 gene is aberrantly expressed in the majority of sporadic colon cancers, in which Wnt signaling is constitutive (20Hovanes K. Li T.W. Munguia J.E. Truong T. Milovanovic T. Lawrence Marsh J. Holcombe R.F. Waterman M.L. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 53-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the underlying mechanism of aberrant LEF1expression is not fully understood, only the promoter for full-length forms of LEF-1 is activated. A second intronic promoter that produces dominant negative forms of LEF-1 remains silent. We have shown that the promoter for full-length LEF-1 is likely to be a Wnt target gene, because it is activated by TCF-1-β-catenin and TCF-4-β-catenin complexes and is sensitive to cellular levels of β-catenin. Inappropriate LEF1 expression may contribute to increased Wnt signal strength by increasing the concentration of LEF/TCF-β-catenin complexes in the nucleus, and such increases appear to be Wnt pathway-directed. We show in this study that the promoter for full-length LEF-1 is activated by β-catenin through two Wnt response elements, but surprisingly this occurs only when β-catenin is recruited by a specific TCF isoform that contains an alternative C-terminal tail referred to as the E-tail. E-tail isoforms of TCF-1, TCF-3, and TCF-4 are generated from alternative splicing at the 3′-end of the pre-mRNA to encode a longer alternative C-terminal region (21van de Wetering M. Castrop J. Korinek V. Clevers H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 22Hovanes K. Li T.W.H. Waterman M.L.

The LEF1locus does not produce an E-tail isoform, because it is missing an E-tail-specific exon. Instead, the most abundant isoform of LEF-1 carries an “N”-tail. Neither the expression pattern nor the function of TCF E-tail isoforms is very well characterized except that they are detected as one of the most abundant isoforms in cell lines, and the TCF-4E and TCF-3 E-tails are able to bind CtBP, a transcription repressor. We show here for the first time that the E-tail of TCF-1 carries a novel transcription-activating function with respect to theLEF1 promoter. This activity is not present in TCF-3E or LEF-1N but remains dependent on β-catenin recruitment. DISCUSSIONWe have described a new activity of the E-tail isoform of TCF-1 that enables β-catenin to activate transcription of theLEF1 promoter in transient transfection assays. The E-tail isoform of TCF-4 is also able to activate the LEF1 promoter (shown previously in Ref. 20Hovanes K. Li T.W. Munguia J.E. Truong T. Milovanovic T. Lawrence Marsh J. Holcombe R.F. Waterman M.L. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 53-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other isoforms of TCF-1 as well as LEF-1N and the disparate E-tail isoform of TCF-3 do not function with β-catenin at this promoter. This is true despite the fact that all LEF/TCF isoforms are equally active with the standard TOPFLASH reporter plasmid. These data suggest that expression of the LEF1locus may be particularly sensitive to regulation by β-catenin complexes containing TCF-E-tail isoforms. Such forms are detected in colon cancer cell lines that aberrantly express LEF1 (23Duval A. Rolland S. Tubacher E. Bui H. Thomas G. Hamelin R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3872-3879PubMed Google Scholar,27Mayer K. Hieronymus T. Castrop J. Clevers H. Ballhausen W. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Several possible mechanisms may enable activation of theLEF1 promoter by the E-tail. Such possibilities include the location of response elements relative to the start site of transcription, regulation of different types of basal promoters, differences in DNA sequence recognition, or interactions with other regulatory proteins. The first two possible mechanisms, the downstream location of the Wnt response elements or the type of basal promoter, are unlikely to affect activation because movement of the response elements to a position 5′ of the start site of transcription of the heterologous TATA-containing Herpesvirus TK promoter does not change the patterns of activity that we observed (Fig. 5). We conclude that the E-tail activity is not likely to subserve promoter-specific or location-specific regulation. The third mechanism, conformation of DNA sequence recognition or affinity, remains a possibility because the DNase I footprinting experiments with recombinant LEF-1N and TCF-1E protein show minor differences in DNaseI hypersensitivities (Fig. 4). Difficulties with the purification of full-length TCF-1E have prevented us from directly comparing DNA-binding affinities with LEF-1N protein. However, to address whether different DNA binding affinities could account for the disparate activities of TCF-1E and LEF-1N, we created a mutantLEF1 promoter reporter plasmid in which the sequences of the two Wnt response elements at +190 and +283 were changed to the high affinity LEF/TCF response sequences present in the TOPFLASH reporter plasmid. Again only TCF-1E was able to work with β-catenin to activate this reporter. 4F. A. Atcha, data not shown. Thus if the E-tail modifies DNA sequence affinity, such differences may only be revealed with reporters containing one or two separated response elements and not the closely apposed multiple elements that are found in the TOPFLASH reporter. Current efforts are under way to more carefully analyze DNA binding affinity, DNA bending, and protein-DNA conformations of the LEF1 promoter response sites by LEF-1N and TCF-1E. A fourth possible mechanism involves the engagement of E-tail motifs in protein interactions as opposed to direct DNA binding. The absolute conservation of the cysteine residues in each motif among TCF orthologs suggests a cysteine-based tertiary structure but not one that matches any known metal-chelating domain (Fig. 2 B). Co-activators of transcription are obvious candidates if protein interaction is involved, but one direct possibility could be that the E-tail enables a better and more stable interaction with β-catenin. This possibility is unlikely, given that CR1mt and CR2mt are as active as wild type TCF-1E for β-catenin-dependent activation of TOPFLASH and that LEF/TCFs without an E-tail efficiently co-immunoprecipitate with β-catenin in COS-7 cells (28Prieve M.G. Waterman M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4503-4515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, multimerized response elements may mask differences between family members in their ability to recruit β-catenin to target promoters, and only careful assessment of β-catenin-binding affinities to DNA-bound LEF/TCFs can resolve this issue. If co-regulators are recruited through interactions with the E-tail domain, then such regulators are most likely to be ubiquitously expressed, because we have observed E-tail-specific activation of theLEF1 promoter in different cell types including mature and immature human T lymphocyte lines (Jurkat and 2017) and COS-1 cells, a monkey kidney cell line. 5F. A. Atcha, unpublished observation. If the E-tail modifies target gene recognition through nucleic acid interactions or protein interactions, it does so via a novel independent mechanism with the CR1 and CR2 motifs playing an important role. The TCF-1 E-tail is a 137-amino acid domain, and for most of this domain, there is little sequence conservation with other TCF E-tails. The exception is the high level of sequence conservation in the most N-terminal part centered over the CR motifs (Fig. 2 B). The CR1 and CR2 peptide motifs of 10 and 15 amino acids, respectively, show the highest conservation between TCF-1 and TCF-4, with TCF-3 having the greatest sequence variance and missing the 9 amino acid CR1 motif completely (Fig. 2 B). Drosophila TCF and theCaenorhabditis elegans ortholog, Pop-1, have nearly identical CR1 and CR2 motifs. We have introduced amino acid substitution mutations in CR1 and CR2, and E-tail activity is abolished in our assays (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, van de Weteringet al. (4van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J. Loureiro J. Ypma A. Hursh D. Jones T. Bejsovec A. Peifer M. Mortin M. Clevers H.

This mutant allele, dTCF1, carries a single alanine-to-valine substitution in the CR1 motif, underscoring the functional importance of this region.Although a detailed understanding of the function of the CR region (also referred to as the CRAR region (3van Noort M. Clevers H. Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar)) is lacking, its activities are likely to be independent and not intrinsically associated with LEF/TCF proteins only. A search of GenBankTM proteins containing similar CR1 and CR2 motifs identified two additional DNA-binding proteins (Fig. 2 B). The first, a 513-amino acid protein called papillomavirus regulatory factor (Prf-1) and papillomavirus binding factor (PBF) was identified in a yeast one-hybrid assay for cellular proteins binding to the E2 binding site, P2, of human papillomavirus type 8 (29Boeckle S. Pfister H. Steger G. Virology. 2002; 293: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The second factor, GLUT4-enhancer factor (G4EF), is highly similar to Prf-1/PBF and was identified as a 387-amino acid DNA-binding protein that recognizes the enhancer for the human GLUT4 transporter gene (30Oshel K.M. Knight J.B. Cao K.T. Thai M.V. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23666-23673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). On the basis of aCX4 C-X12 H-X4 Hsequence in the middle portion of each protein, both Prf-1/PBF and G4EF are proposed to contain a TFIIIA-like zinc finger DNA-binding domain. Indeed Prf-1/PBF has been shown to bind specifically to DNA sequences with CCGG at the core (29Boeckle S. Pfister H. Steger G. Virology. 2002; 293: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Unlike the closely juxtaposed high mobility group DNA-binding domain and CR1/2motifs of the TCFs, the homologous CR1/2 motifs in Prf-1/PBF lie at the extreme C-terminal end of the protein, 139 residues away from the putative zinc finger DNA-binding domain. Thus, if CR1/2 motifs influence DNA binding for all these different proteins, they must do so as independent and auxiliary motifs able to cope with variable placement relative to different types of DNA-binding domains.The results that we report in this study support the intriguing possibility that not all LEF/TCFs are functionally equivalent and that different isoforms may preferentially regulate different subsets of Wnt target genes. Such a possibility is consistent with genetic data from knock-out and transgenic mice experiments in which the removal of theLEF1 gene or TCF1 gene generated partially non-redundant phenotypes in tissues where their expression patterns overlapped or where overexpression of dominant negative forms of LEF/TCFs produced non-identical phenotypes (31Okamura R.

We have described a new activity of the E-tail isoform of TCF-1 that enables β-catenin to activate transcription of theLEF1 promoter in transient transfection assays. The E-tail isoform of TCF-4 is also able to activate the LEF1 promoter (shown previously in Ref. 20Hovanes K. Li T.W. Munguia J.E. Truong T. Milovanovic T. Lawrence Marsh J. Holcombe R.F.

Although a detailed understanding of the function of the CR region (also referred to as the CRAR region (3van Noort M. Clevers H. Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar)) is lacking, its activities are likely to be independent and not intrinsically associated with LEF/TCF proteins only. A search of GenBankTM proteins containing similar CR1 and CR2 motifs identified two additional DNA-binding proteins (Fig. 2 B). The first, a 513-amino acid protein called papillomavirus regulatory factor (Prf-1) and papillomavirus binding factor (PBF) was identified in a yeast one-hybrid assay for cellular proteins binding to the E2 binding site, P2, of human papillomavirus type 8 (29Boeckle S. Pfister H. Steger G. Virology. 2002; 293: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The second factor, GLUT4-enhancer factor (G4EF), is highly similar to Prf-1/PBF and was identified as a 387-amino acid DNA-binding protein that recognizes the enhancer for the human GLUT4 transporter gene (30Oshel K.M. Knight J.B. Cao K.T. Thai M.V. Olson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23666-23673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). On the basis of aCX4 C-X12 H-X4 Hsequence in the middle portion of each protein, both Prf-1/PBF and G4EF are proposed to contain a TFIIIA-like zinc finger DNA-binding domain. Indeed Prf-1/PBF has been shown to bind specifically to DNA sequences with CCGG at the core (29Boeckle S. Pfister H. Steger G. Virology. 2002; 293: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Unlike the closely juxtaposed high mobility group DNA-binding domain and CR1/2motifs of the TCFs, the homologous CR1/2 motifs in Prf-1/PBF lie at the extreme C-terminal end of the protein, 139 residues away from the putative zinc finger DNA-binding domain. Thus, if CR1/2 motifs influence DNA binding for all these different proteins, they must do so as independent and auxiliary motifs able to cope with variable placement relative to different types of DNA-binding domains. The results that we report in this study support the intriguing possibility that not all LEF/TCFs are functionally equivalent and that different isoforms may preferentially regulate different subsets of Wnt target genes. Such a possibility is consistent with genetic data from knock-out and transgenic mice experiments in which the removal of theLEF1 gene or TCF1 gene generated partially non-redundant phenotypes in tissues where their expression patterns overlapped or where overexpression of dominant negative forms of LEF/TCFs produced non-identical phenotypes (31Okamura R.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1688-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Whether a portion of these non-redundant activities is a result of the expression of E-tail isoforms and whether such specialized functions play a role in tumor development are unknowns that are important to address if we are to understand the role that Wnt signals play in promoting cancer.

GPI transamidase is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and mediates post-translational transfer of preformed GPI to proteins bearing a carboxyl-terminal GPI attachment signal. Mammalian GPI transamidase is a multimeric complex consisting of at least five subunits. Here we report that two subunits of mammalian GPI transamidase, GPI8 and PIG-T, form a functionally important disulfide bond between conserved cysteine residues. GPI8 and PIG-T mutants in which relevant cysteines were replaced with serines were unable to fully restore the surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins upon transfection into their respective mutant cells. Microsomal membranes of these transfectants had markedly decreased activities in an in vitrotransamidase assay. The formation of this disulfide bond is not essential but required for full transamidase activity. Antibodies against GPI8 and PIG-T revealed that endogenous as well as exogenous proteins formed a disulfide bond. Furthermore trypanosome GPI8 forms a similar intermolecular disulfide bond via its conserved cysteine residue, suggesting that the trypanosome GPI transamidase is also a multimeric complex likely containing the orthologue of PIG-T. We also demonstrate that an inactive human GPI transamidase complex that consists of non-functional GPI8 and four other components was co-purified with the proform of substrate proteins, indicating that these five components are sufficient to hold the substrate proteins.

In addition to the amino-terminal signal peptide required for entry into the ER, precursor proteins destined to be GPI-anchored have carboxyl-terminal GPI attachment signals that direct GPI modification. GPI transamidase mediates cleavage of the GPI attachment signal peptide and en bloc transfer of a preassembled GPI to newly exposed carboxyl terminus of precursor proteins. During this transamidation reaction, GPI transamidase forms a carbonyl intermediate with substrate proteins (1Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev.

The requirement of GPI in protozoan parasites depends on the species and stage of life cycle (8Hilley J.D. Zawadzki J.L. McConville M.J. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Nagamune K. Nozaki T. Maeda Y. Ohishi K. Fukuma T. Hara T. Schwarz R.T. Sutterlin C. Brun R. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. Proc. Natl.

For example, the bloodstream form ofTrypanosome brucei requires GPI; in contrast the GPI-deficient procyclic form (insect stage) of this parasite is viable but has decreased infectivity toward its vector, tsetse fly (9Nagamune K. Nozaki T. Maeda Y. Ohishi K. Fukuma T. Hara T. Schwarz R.T. Sutterlin C. Brun R. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus selective inhibitors of GPI synthesis could be potent therapeutic drugs for diseases caused by these microorganisms (11Ferguson M.A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10673-10675Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and such drugs could utilize the differential substrate specificity of enzymes mediating GPI synthesis and anchoring. It is, therefore, important to characterize human and parasitic GPI transamidases and investigate molecular mechanisms conferring specificity. Human GPI transamidase is a complex consisting of at least five components, GAA1, GPI8, PIG-S, PIG-T, and PIG-U (12Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4088-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Hong Y. Ohishi K. Kang J.Y. Tanaka S. Inoue N. Nishimura J.-i. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; (10.1091/mbc.E02-12-0794)Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae transamidase is composed of the respective orthologues Gaa1p, Gpi8p, Gpi17p, Gpi16p, and Cdc91p (12Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kinoshita T.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3295-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). All these components are essential for the formation of carbonyl intermediates (12Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4088-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Hong Y. Ohishi K. Kang J.Y. Tanaka S. Inoue N. Nishimura J.-i. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 12580-12585Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that GPI8/Gpi8p are catalytic components. (i) They belong to the C13 cysteine peptidase family (16Benghezal M. Benachour A. Rusconi S. Aebi M. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6575-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), one of which, Canavalia ensiformis asparaginyl endopeptidase, catalyzes a transamidation reaction in vitro(17Abe Y. Shirane K.

Szallies A. Rawer M. Echner H. Duszenko M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2529-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). (iv) Finally in vitro translated model substrate proteins can be cross-linked to GPI8 indicating that they are situated in close proximity to each other during the transamidation reaction (23Vidugiriene J. Vainauskas S. Johnson A.E. Menon A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2290-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Spurway T.D. Dalley J.A. High S. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15975-15982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). GPI8 homologues are divided into two groups, type I transmembrane proteins (human, S. cerevisiae, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and soluble proteins lacking a corresponding transmembrane region (T. brucei,Leishmania mexicana, Drosophila melanogaster, andCaenorhabditis elegans). A human GPI8 mutant lacking its transmembrane region seemed to be integrated into the complex correctly because it fully rescued GPI8 mutant cells and was co-precipitated with GAA1 (18Ohishi K. Inoue N. Maeda Y. Takeda J. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We have proposed that PIG-T/Gpi16p has a central role in the formation of the transamidase complex because stable expression of GPI8/Gpi8p exclusively depends on PIG-T/Gpi16p (12Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4088-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Fraering P. Imhof I. Meyer U. Strub J.M. van Dorsselaer A. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3295-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that GPI8 and PIG-T form a disulfide bridge that is required for normal transamidase activity via conserved cysteine residues not only in mammalian cells but also in T. bruceiand provide direct evidence that a transamidase complex consisting of five components associates with translocated substrate proteins. K562, class K (15Yu J. Nagarajan S. Knez J.J. Udenfriend S. Chen R. Medof M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4088-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All expression plasmids were constructed on the pME18Sf vector, a gift from Dr. K. Maruyama (Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan). Phosphoglycerokinase-driven puromycin, hygromycin, and blasticidin resistance gene cassettes (18Ohishi K. Inoue N. Maeda Y. Takeda J. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were cloned into a unique HindIII site of the pME18Sf vector (designated as pMEpuro, pMEhyg, and pMEbsd, respectively) and used to establish stable transfectants. Plasmids for FLAG-GAA1, GST-GPI8, HA-PIG-S, and Myc-PIG-T were used previously (12Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4088-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The amino- and carboxyl-terminal FLAG and GST tandem (FG) tags used were described previously (12Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4088-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) with the addition of a single and triple flexible linker (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser) between FLAG and GST as well as between GST and the tagged protein, respectively, to improve the yield of affinity purification. Cysteine-to-serine mutants of GPI8 and PIG-T were made with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Sequences of all primers used in this study are available upon request. K562 and class K cells were transfected with pMEpuro-derived plasmids and selected at 2 μg/ml puromycin. PIG-T knockout F9 cells were transfected with pMEbsd-CD59. After selection at 4 μg/ml blasticidin, a clone with high transfection efficiency and high PIG-T-dependent surface expression of CD59 was isolated. This clone was further transfected with pMEhyg-PIG-T plasmids and selected at 500 μg/ml hygromycin. Affinity purification of the transamidase complex with anti-FLAG beads (Sigma) and glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) was performed as reported previously (12Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4088-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) except that SDS-PAGE sample buffer contained 8 m urea to improve denaturation of PIG-U (13Hong Y. Ohishi K. Kang J.Y. Tanaka S. Inoue N. Nishimura J.-i. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; (10.1091/mbc.E02-12-0794)Google Scholar) and 10 mm iodoacetamide for non-reducing conditions to prevent disulfide rearrangements. The amino-terminal sequence was determined from Coomassie-stained bands transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with a G1005A Hewlett-Packard Protein Sequencing System. The bands excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which were stained with SYPRO Ruby (Molecular Probes) or a mass spectrometry-compatible SilverQuest silver staining kit (Invitrogen), were subjected to in-gel digestion by trypsin or lysylendopeptidase, analyzed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry with MAGIC 2002 (Michrom Bioresources) and Q-Tof2 (Micromass), and identified by Mascot search (Matrix Science). To analyze the formation of the disulfide bond between GPI8 and PIG-T, cells were pretreated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 30 min on ice and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 140 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, pH 7.4) containing 20 mm NEM. CHO cells were electroporated with 5 μg each of the indicated plasmids as reported previously (12Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4088-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). GST-tagged GPI8 was precipitated with glutathione beads. The precipitates were divided into four aliquots and Western blotted with anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-GST (Amersham Biosciences), anti-Myc (Oncogene Research Products), anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and horse radish peroxidase-conjugated protein G (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates of class K cells transfected with FG-GPI8 constructs and PIG-T knockout cells transfected with Myc-PIG-T constructs were subjected to precipitation with glutathione beads and anti-Myc antibody plus protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. Whole cell lysates were prepared as follows. After treatment with NEM, cell pellets were solubilized in lysis buffer with NEM at 2 × 107cells/ml for K562 and HeLa or 4 × 107 cells/ml for class K cells. Postnuclear lysates were mixed with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer with iodoacetamide. For in vitro translation of human GPI8, 1.2-kb NcoI-XbaI fragments of full-length wild-type and C92S mutant GPI8 cDNA were cloned in NcoI and XbaI sites of pSPUTK (Stratagene). Plasmids were linearized with EcoRI and used as templates for in vitro transcription. Capped mRNA synthesized using the AmpliScribe SP6 High Yield Transcription Kit (Epicentre) and RNA cap structure analog (New England Biolabs) wasin vitro translated using Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and class K microsomal membrane for 90 min in the presence or absence of 2 mm dithiothreitol in 25 μl according to the manufacturer's protocol. After incubation, 20 μl of the reaction mixture was diluted 10-fold with a buffer (50 mmtriethanolamine, 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm NEM, pH 7.5), layered on, and sedimented through 200 μl of a cushion (50 mm triethanolamine, 500 mm sucrose, 20 mm NEM, pH 7.5) by ultracentrifugation with a Beckman TLA-100.2 rotor at 80,000 rpm for 15 min. Membrane pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm NEM and solubilized in sample buffer with iodoacetamide. To reduce the sample, one-fifth volume of 2-mercaptoethanol was added. For direct analysis by SDS-PAGE, 5 μl of each reaction was mixed with 15 μl of sample buffer with iodoacetamide or 2-mercaptoethanol immediately after the reaction. The in vitro GPI transamidase assay using miniPLAP (placental alkaline phosphatase) originally developed by Kodukulaet al. (25Kodukula K. Micanovic R. Gerber L. Tamburrini M. Brink L. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4464-4470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was performed as described previously (18Ohishi K. Inoue N. Maeda Y. Takeda J. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cells were stained with biotinylated anti-CD59 5H8 followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Biomeda) and analyzed on a FACScaliber (BD Biosciences). We immunized rabbits with affinity-purified, carboxyl-terminally His-tagged human GPI8 (Ser28–Ser264) and human PIG-T (Ile308–Leu578). Human GPI8 (Ser28–Ser264) and human PIG-T (Leu22–Leu578), respectively, were expressed as maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins and coupled to HiTrapN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated HP columns (Amersham Biosciences). An IgG fraction of antisera was isolated with HiTrap rProtein A FF columns (Amersham Biosciences), preadsorbed with MBP-coupled columns, and finally affinity-purified with MBP-GPI8 or MBP-PIG-T columns. We disrupted trypanosomalGPI8 (TbGPI8) gene in procyclic form ofT. brucei as described previously (9Nagamune K. Nozaki T. Maeda Y. Ohishi K. Fukuma T. Hara T. Schwarz R.T. Sutterlin C. Brun R. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10336-10341Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). An episomal plasmid, pTMCSzeo, was constructed by replacing the neomycin resistance gene with a bleomycin resistance gene and inserting a multiple cloning site (nine restriction enzyme sites) flanked by aldolase splice acceptor signal and polyadenylation signal into a unique SmaI site of pT11-bs (26Patnaik P.K. Fang X. Cross G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4111-4118Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A 1-kb fragment encoding FLAG-tagged wild-type or C76S mutant TbGPI8 was amplified by PCR and cloned into KpnI andBamHI sites of pTMCSzeo. TbGPI8 knockout procyclics were transfected with the resulting plasmids by electroporation and selected at 2–10 μg/ml phleomycin. Transfectants were stained with monoclonal anti-EP-procyclin (Cedarlane Laboratories) plus fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody and analyzed in a FACScaliber. For immunoprecipitation, cells of a confluent 10-ml culture (∼108) were pretreated, lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer with NEM, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG beads. We previously reported that GPI transamidase components GAA1, PIG-S, PIG-T, and PIG-U were co-purified with FLAG- and GST-tagged GPI8 (FG-GPI8) by a two-step affinity purification using anti-FLAG and glutathione beads. Under reducing conditions, FG-GPI8, GAA1, PIG-S, and PIG-T migrate at 60–70 kDa (12Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4088-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), while PIG-U migrates as a diffuse band at 35 kDa (13Hong Y. Ohishi K. Kang J.Y. Tanaka S. Inoue N. Nishimura J.-i. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; (10.1091/mbc.E02-12-0794)Google Scholar) (Fig.1C, left lane). Under non-reducing conditions, however, most of the FG-GPI8 migrates at about 160 kDa. Western blotting with anti-GST antibody detected an intense 160-kDa band with more slowly migrating minor bands in addition to a faint 70-kDa monomeric FG-GPI8 band (Fig. 1A). These high molecular mass bands disappeared when the sample was analyzed under reducing conditions (data not shown), suggesting that a major fraction of GPI8 is ligated to other proteins through a disulfide bond. To see whether GPI8 is linked to other GPI transamidase components or to unknown proteins, we analyzed the same sample by silver staining. Consistent with the Western blotting results, several bands appeared at and over 160 kDa, and only two intense bands remained at around the 70-kDa position (Fig. 1B), suggesting that a covalent complex was formed between GPI8 and another 60–70-kDa component of transamidase. To test this, the same sample was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (Fig. 1C). The first dimension of electrophoresis was performed under non-reducing conditions as in Fig. 1B, and then a gel strip was reduced and subjected to a second dimension of electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Two spots derived from the 160kDa bands in the first dimension ran side by side below the gel diagonal (Fig. 1C), suggesting that formation of several 160-kDa bands may be due to multiple conformations of a single GPI8-containing complex. The two 60–70-kDa bands in the first dimension gave two spots on the diagonal (Fig. 1C), indicating that the 160-kDa bands are intermolecular disulfide-bonded complexes of two 60–70-kDa proteins. While one of these proteins is FG-GPI8, the partner protein could not be identified based on mobility because the difference in molecular weight between GAA1, PIG-S, and PIG-T is quite small and the two dimensional gel was slightly distorted. To determine the partner protein linked to GPI8, we transfected differentially tagged GPI8, PIG-T, GAA1, and PIG-S into CHO cells. Transfectants were pretreated and lysed in the presence of 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide, a membrane-permeable alkylating reagent, to trap disulfides formed within the cells and to prevent their rearrangement during and after lysis (27Krijnse Locker J. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 267-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The GPI transamidase complex was precipitated with glutathione beads and Western blotted with anti-tag antibodies (Fig.2A). Anti-GST and anti-Myc but not anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies detected the 160-kDa band, indicating that PIG-T is the partner protein. The anti-GST- and anti-Myc-reactive 160-kDa band was not detected when the samples were reduced (data not shown). Human GPI8 has five cysteines, but only Cys92 and Cys206 are conserved in other orthologues. To determine the cysteine residue involved in this disulfide linkage, we constructed cysteine-to-serine mutants of GPI8. Cys206 is a catalytic site of GPI transamidase as reported previously (18Ohishi K. Inoue N. Maeda Y. Takeda J. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mutant GPI8 proteins were stably expressed in class K cells. Expression of C51S was very low, but this mutant clearly generated the 160-kDa band (Fig. 2B). Only the C92S mutant was incapable of forming the 160-kDa band, indicating that Cys92 of GPI8 is used for the disulfide bond. Cys139 and Cys182 of human PIG-T are conserved between species. These cysteine residues were mutated to serines and stably expressed in PIG-T knockout cells. The C182S mutant of PIG-T did not form a covalent complex, whereas the C139S mutant formed the covalent complex (Fig. 2C). Therefore, Cys92 of GPI8 and Cys182 of PIG-T are involved in formation of the disulfide bond. Notably the disulfide linkage is not essential for the generation of the tetrameric complex since the C182S mutant of PIG-T, GAA1, and PIG-S were co-precipitated with GPI8, and conversely the C92S mutant of GPI8 co-precipitated GAA1, PIG-T, and PIG-S normally when expressed in CHO cells (data not shown). To examine whether the disulfide linkage is functionally important for GPI transamidase activity, we determined the abilities of GPI8 and PIG-T mutants to restore the surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins on their respective mutant cells (Fig.3). Wild-type GPI8 restored the surface CD59 expression on class K cells to a level similar to parental K562 cells (data not shown). The C206S mutant had no complementation activity as previously reported because this cysteine is an active site of GPI transamidase (18Ohishi K. Inoue N. Maeda Y. Takeda J. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The C51S and C275S/C280S mutants restored CD59 expression at levels similar to wild-type GPI8, whereas the C92S mutant only partially restored CD59 expression even in this overexpression experiment (mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) for wild type, C51S, C275S/C280S, and C92S were 893, 678, 873, and 187, respectively) (see below for a slightly lower MFI for C51S mutant). We also assessed the activities of PIG-T mutants in PIG-Tknockout F9 cells, which express a high level of CD59 on the cell surface when rescued with PIG-T. In stable transfectants, the difference in MFI between wild type (MFI = 1269), the C139S mutant (MFI = 1222), and the C182S mutant (MFI = 935) transfectants was relatively small, probably due to a compensation of low activity inherent to stable overexpression systems. We therefore tested transient expression of PIG-T proteins using the same cells. While wild type (MFI = 1141) and the C139S mutant (MFI = 1042) restored the surface expression of CD59 at comparable levels, the C182S mutant restored it at a significantly lower level (MFI = 434). The surface expression of GPI-anchored marker proteins is not a direct measure of the rate of GPI modification but rather measures the accumulation of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface. Therefore, we used an in vitro GPI transamidase assay for more direct evaluation (Fig. 4). Again the C206S mutant GPI8 showed no transamidase activity. The C275S/C280S mutant processed miniPLAP at a level similar to wild type. C51S had a significantly lower activity, but this might be due to its low expression. When specific activity was calculated by dividing the intensity of the GPI-anchored and free form bands by the GPI8 protein level, the C51S mutant had 95% of the activity of wild type. The C92S mutant was expressed well; however, it had only 17% of the wild-type activity (Fig. 4, left). Similarly the C182S mutant of PIG-T restored only a trace amount of GPI-anchored miniPLAP in both stable and transient expression systems (Fig. 4,right). Thus, the disulfide linkage between GPI8 and PIG-T is important but not essential for normal GPI transamidase activity. To further rule out the possibility that disulfide formation is restricted to overexpression experiments and does not reproduce in an in vivo situation, it is important to demonstrate that endogenous GPI8 and PIG-T form an intermolecular disulfide bond. First we tested disulfide bond formation in an in vitro translation system that can reproduce co- and post-translational modifications occurring in the ER. We have previously shown that a trimeric complex of GAA1, PIG-T, and PIG-S is stably formed in the absence of GPI8; thus class K cells might contain this trimeric complex. Microsomal membranes of class K cells were, therefore, expected to process a disulfide bond formation between in vitro translated GPI8 and pre-existing endogenous PIG-T. As shown in Fig. 5, the proform of wild-type GPI8 was converted to the mature form by cleavage of the signal peptide and was able to form a 160-kDa complex when the translation reaction was performed in the absence of dithiothreitol (lane 1).

DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, the chromosomal replicase of Escherichia coli, contains a clamp-loading machine within its multi-component structure (reviewed in Ref. 1Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The clamp loader couples ATP hydrolysis to the assembly of circular β clamps onto primed DNA sites. The circular β clamp, formed from two crescent-shaped protomers, binds to the DNA polymerase III core (αεθ), tethering it to template DNA for highly processive synthesis. There are at least two molecules of DNA polymerase III core within the holoenzyme architecture, held together by one clamp loader. The γ complex clamp loader consists of several different subunits,i.e. three γ (τ) subunits and one each of δ, δ′, χ, and ψ (2Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In order for this clamp loader to bind two molecules of DNA polymerase III core, two of the γ subunits are replaced by two τ subunits. τ and γ are encoded by the same gene (dnaX); τ is the full-length product, and γ is truncated by a translational frameshift (8Blinkowa A.L. Walker J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 9Flower A.M. McHenry C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The N-terminal 47 kDa of τ contains the sequence of the γ subunit, thus explaining how γ and τ can replace one another in clamp loading action with δ and δ′ (11Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11766-11772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extra 24 kDa of C-terminal sequence unique to τ is responsible for binding DNA polymerase III core (12Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Thus, a single clamp loader cross links two DNA polymerases and holds the hexameric helicase into the replisome (reviewed in Ref. 6O'Donnell M. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. Curr.

O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 171-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The δ subunit forms the main attachment to the β clamp and can open the β ring single-handedly (16Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 17Stewart J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 6: 6Google Scholar, 18Leu F.P. Hingorani M.M. Turner J.

The δ′ subunit modulates the ability of δ to bind β (16Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 17Stewart J.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, with ATP bound to the γ subunits, δ is pulled away from δ′, allowing δ to bind and open the β ring (4Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 20Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this state, with β and ATP bound to the γ complex, a tight affinity for DNA is established (21Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Upon recognizing a primed site, the ATP is hydrolyzed, resulting in the dissociation of the γ complex from β, leaving β to close around the DNA, whereupon it may associate with the polymerase component of the holoenzyme. β also interacts with several other proteins besides the DNA polymerase III core. These include ligase, MutS, UvrB, DNA polymerases I, II, IV and V, and possibly many other proteins involved in DNA repair (23Bonner C.A. Stukenberg P.T. Rajagopalan M. Eritja R. O'Donnell M.

These additional roles of β in other processes besides replication may account for the presence of the γ complex inE. coli that lacks τ altogether, presumably freeing it for action at sites distinct from the replication fork. The structure of γ3δδ′ reveals that the ATP sites of the γ subunits are located at subunit interfaces (see Fig. 1) (4Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Site 1 is at the δ′/γ1 interface, site 2 is at the γ1/γ2 interface, and site 3 is at the γ2/γ3 interface. The site 3 γ3 subunit is located directly next to the δ wrench. The numbering of these sites is thought to reflect the order in which they become filled with ATP (4Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The major pentameric contacts occur via the C-terminal domains of the five subunits. The ATP binding sites of γ are located in the N-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain of δ is also where the β interactive element is located (19Jeruzalmi D. Yurieva O. Zhao Y. Young M. Stewart J. Hingorani M. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), although the proximity of δ′ to δ blocks access of δ to β (4Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Combining several biochemical findings with the structure of γ3δδ′ suggests that, as the ATP sites fill, conformation changes in γ are propagated around the pentamer to pull the δ wrench away from the δ′ stator so that δ can bind to β for clamp opening. The apparent rigidity of δ′, compared with γ and δ, which have a flexible joint for motion in clamp loading, has earned δ′ the term “stator”. ATP hydrolysis presumably reverses the conformational changes in γ and δ induced by ATP binding to γ, thus bringing the N-terminal domain of δ back into proximity to the δ′ stator. This effectively pushes β off of δ, allowing the β ring to close around DNA. The subunits of γ3δδ′ are members of the large AAA+ family (27Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As their name implies (ATPasesassociated with a variety of cellularactivities), these proteins are generally ATPases, and they function in a wide diversity of cellular processes. The structure of the homohexameric AAA+ proteins NSF and p97 (membrane fusion), RuvB (branch migration), and HslU (proteosome) reveals an Arg residue that reaches over the interface to the ATP site of the neighboring subunit (28Zhang X. Shaw A. Bates P.A. Newman R.H. Gowen B. Orlova E. Gorman M.A. Kondo H. Dokurno P. Lally J. Leonard G. Meyer H. van Heel M. Freemont P.S. Mol.

This Arg is thought to be analogous to the “arginine finger” of GAP, which plays a catalytic role in hydrolysis of GTP bound to Ras by stabilizing the accumulating negative charge in the transition state (32Ahmadian M.R. Stege P. Scheffzek K. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). It is proposed that the use of this Arg residue in catalysis provides a means of intersubunit communication that coordinates nucleotide hydrolysis around the ring. The γ complex has many similarities to the homohexameric AAA+ proteins but also has several important differences. The largest differences are its heterooligomeric composition, use of five subunits instead of six, and the presence of two subunits that do not bind ATP. Like the homohexamers, the γ complex subunits are arranged in a ring, and the γ subunit ATP sites are located at interfaces where the Arg of one subunit is in proximity to ATP modeled into the subunit adjacent to it (Fig. 1). This Arg residue is embedded in an SRC motif that is conserved in clamp-loading subunits of T4 phage, eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. The δ′ subunit also contains an SRC motif, and the Arg residue is proximal to ATP site 1 of γ1. In each case, the Arg needs to move a few angstroms to be near enough to exert an influence on the bound ATP. The contribution of these potential arginine fingers to ATP binding, hydrolysis, and clamp loading is one subject of this report. The results demonstrate that these SRC motif arginine residues in both γ and δ′ are not required for ATP binding; however, they are important to catalysis. The finding that δ′ contributes a catalytic arginine residue to an ATP site in the γ trimer motor demonstrates that the δ′ stator also functions as a component of the motor of the clamp loader. This conclusion has implications for analogies between the γ complex and clamp loaders of other systems (see “Discussion”). Furthermore, the findings indicate that there is an ordered sequence to hydrolysis. Mutation of the arginine in γ removes the catalytic arginine in sites 2 and 3 but not the arginine contributed by δ′ to site 1. However, this mutation prevents hydrolysis of ATP in all three sites. This result indicates there is a sequential order to hydrolysis of the three ATP molecules, with ATP in sites 2 and/or 3 being hydrolyzed before ATP in site 1.

Analysis of ATP binding to wild-type and mutant γ complexes was performed by equilibrium gel filtration as described (41Hummel J.P. Dryer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Wild-type and either the γ (R169A) γ complex or the δ′ (R158A) γ complex (8.3 μm γ complex in 60 μl; 6.6 μm γ (R169A) complex in 150 μl; 6.6 μm δ′ (R158A) γ complex in 150 μl) were incubated in gel filtration buffer plus 100 mm NaCl containing [α-32P]ATP at the indicated concentration (0.1–10 μm) for 15 min. at 25 °C. Samples were then applied to a 5-ml Biogel P-6 column (Bio-Rad) at 25 °C pre-equilibrated in gel filtration buffer plus 100 mm NaCl having the same concentration of [α-32P]ATP as the respective sample. Thirty-five fractions of 240 μl each were collected, and 100 μl of each fraction was analyzed by liquid scintillation to determine the total amount of ATP ([ATP]TOTAL, see below). 50 μl of the peak fractions were also analyzed for total protein concentration by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using γ complex as a standard. Scatchard analysis from equilibrium gel filtration data was as described (42Davey M.J. Funnell B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15286-15292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ability of the wild-type and mutant γ complexes to associate with β was analyzed by gel filtration on a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences). β (30 μm, 480 μg) was incubated alone or with the γ complex (25 μm, 1.25 mg) for 15 min. at 15 °C in 200 μl of Buffer A plus 100 mm NaCl containing 1 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2. The mixture was then injected onto a 24-ml Superose 12 column equilibrated in the same buffer at 4 °C. After collecting the first 5.8 ml (void volume), fractions of 155 μl were collected and analyzed in a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Wild-type and mutant γ complexes were tested for ATPase activity in the presence of the synthetic primed template with or without β. ATPase assays contained 50 nmγ complex, 1 mm [α-32P]ATP, 200 nm β dimer (when present), and 500 nmsynthetic primed template DNA in a final volume of 60 μl of ATPase buffer. The synthetic primer/template DNA is linear and thus allows β to slide off the ends after it is loaded. Thus, β is continuously recycled during these assays as demonstrated previously (43Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30699-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Reactions were brought to 37 °C and initiated upon the addition of the γ complex. Aliquots of 5 μl each were removed at intervals (0–10 min) and quenched with an equal volume of 0.5 m EDTA (pH 7.5). One microliter of each quenched aliquot was spotted on a polyethyleneimine cellulose TLC sheet (EM Science) and developed in 0.6m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 3.4). The TLC sheet was dried and [α-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ADP were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Clamp loading was measured by separating32P-βPK on DNA from free32P-βPK using BioGel A15m, a large pore resin that excludes large DNA substrates but includes protein.32P-βPK (13.3 nm as dimer) was incubated for 10 min. at 37 °C either alone or with mutant or wild-type γ complex (10.7 nm) in 75 μl of reaction buffer containing primed M13mp18 ssDNA (13.3 nm), SSB (3.2 μm as tetramer), 1 mm ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2. The reaction was applied to a 5-ml BioGel A15m column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in gel filtration buffer plus 50 mm NaCl at 25 °C. Thirty-five fractions of 180 μl each were collected, and 100 μl was analyzed by liquid scintillation.32P-βPK bound to the DNA elutes early (fractions 11–15), whereas the free 32P-βPKelutes later (fraction 17–28). The amount of β in each fraction was determined from its known specific activity. The activity of wild-type and mutant γ complexes was assayed by the requirement to load β onto a primed circular M13mp18 ssDNA template in order to observe nucleotide incorporation by the core polymerase (αεθ subunits). The reaction mixture contained core polymerase (5 nm), β (10 nm as dimer), SSB (420 nm tetramer), primed M13mp18 ssDNA (1.1 nm), 60 μm each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 20 μm [α-32P]TTP, 1 mm ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2 in 25 μl of reaction buffer (final volume). Replication was initiated upon the addition of either the wild-type or the mutant γ complex (0–1.28 nm titration) and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Reactions were quenched upon the addition of 25 μl of 1% SDS and 40 mm EDTA. Quenched reactions were spotted onto DE81 (Whatman) filters and then washed and quantitated by liquid scintillation as described (33Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arginine 169 is located in the highly conserved SRC motif of the γ subunit. To assess the importance of γ arginine 169 to clamp-loading activity, we mutated it to alanine and purified the γ (R169A) protein from an overproducing strain of E. coli. To study the effect of this mutation on clamp loader activity, we reconstituted the γ complex using γ (R169A) with δ, δ′, χ, and ψ. Our previous studies have shown that a fully assembled γ complex is stable to ion exchange chromatography on an fast protein liquid chromatography MonoQ column, where it elutes much later than the free subunits (11Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11766-11772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The γ (R169A) mutant was mixed with an excess of δ, δ′, χ, and ψ, incubated for 30 min at 15 °C, and then applied to a MonoQ column followed with a gradient of NaCl. The result, in Fig.2A, demonstrates that the γ (R169A) mutant forms a “γ (R169A) complex” in which all five subunits co-elute in fractions 41–49, whereas the excess subunits elute much earlier. As demonstrated later in this report (Fig. 4), the γ (R169A) complex also remains intact during analysis on a gel filtration column. The subunit ratio of the γ (R169A) complex is comparable with that of the wild-type γ complex as observed in the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS polyacrylamide gel of Fig. 2B. This ability of γ (R169A) to assemble into a multisubunit complex with δ, δ′, χ, and ψ demonstrates that the γ (R169A) mutant is properly folded. It also provides reconstituted γ (R169A) complex for the studies to follow.Figure 4ATP promotes β binding in the γ (R169A) complex.The interaction between β and the γ complex was analyzed by gel filtration on a Superose 12 column to separate free β (fractions 37–43) from β bound to the γ complex (fractions 22–31).A, β alone in the presence of ATP. B, β and wild-type γ complex with ATP. C, β and the γ (R169A) complex with ATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we determined whether γ (R169A) complex binds ATP and, if so, whether it binds ATP with similar stoichiometry and affinity compared with the wild-type γ complex. To address these issues, we used the equilibrium gel filtration technique. In this analysis, a gel filtration column is equilibrated with a known concentration of [32P]ATP. The γ complex is incubated with the same concentration of [32P]ATP present in the column buffer and is then applied to the column. Fractions are collected, and the amount of protein and [32P]ATP in each fraction is determined. Protein-bound [32P]ATP is carried around the beads, resulting in a peak of [32P]ATP that elutes early and is followed later by a trough that has less [32P]ATP than the column buffer due to its displacement from the buffer by the protein. This information can be used to calculate the Kd value for ATP binding to the complex. However, a more accurate assessment of theKd value can be obtained by repeating the experiment at a variety of ATP concentrations (the column is equilibrated at different ATP concentrations) followed by plotting the data as a Scatchard plot. This detailed analysis also carries the advantage of providing the stoichiometry of ATP bound to the complex. The results, in Fig. 3, show that γ (R169A) complex binds three molecules of ATP with similar affinity as wild-type γ complex (Kd, 1–2 μm). The data for both the wild-type and the γ (R169A) complex fall on a relatively straight line, indicating that the three sites bind ATP with similar affinity. This conclusion is also supported by a study of a monomeric γ subunit (missing the C-terminal oligomerization domain) that binds ATP with a Kd value of 1.36 μm, determined by isothermal calorimetry (44Podobnik M. Weitze T.F. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Structure. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, these results indicate that the two ATP sites that carry alanine residues in place of arginine 169 (sites 2 and 3) still bind ATP and that this arginine residue contributes little, if any, to the binding affinity of ATP to the γ complex. Previous studies have demonstrated that ATP binding to the γ complex induces the conformation change that leads to the binding of the β subunit (21Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24550-24563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This predicts that the γ (R169A) complex, which binds ATP, should be capable of binding to β. To test this prediction, we analyzed a mixture of the γ (R169A) complex and β for complex formation on a Superose 12 sizing column equilibrated with buffer containing ATP. β alone migrates in fractions 37–43 (Fig.4A). Analysis of a mixture of wild-type γ complex and β is shown in Fig. 4B; the β subunit co-elutes with the large γ complex in fractions 22–31 and resolves from unbound β, which elutes in the later fractions. A similar analysis using γ (R169A) complex, shown in Fig.4C, demonstrates that the mutant γ complex is also capable of associating with β. The amount of β that comigrates with the γ (R169A) complex is nearly the same compared with that of the wild-type γ complex, indicating that it is capable of binding β, although its affinity for β may be somewhat decreased by the mutation. ATP binding, not hydrolysis, powers all the steps of clamp loading except the fin"

However, neither its physiological substrate nor its mechanism of action in tyrosine kinase signaling has been demonstrated. We reasoned that the identification of physiological substrates of SHP2 would be a stepping stone in elucidating its mechanism of action, and, thus, we constructed a potent trapping mutant of SHP2. Surprisingly, the frequently used Asp to Ala substitution did not give rise to a trapping mutant. However, we were able to develop an efficient trapping mutant of SHP2 by introducing Asp to Ala and Cys to Ser double mutations. The double mutant (DM) protein identified the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the Grb2 binder 1, and three other, as yet unidentified, phosphotyrosyl proteins as candidate physiological substrates. Given that substrate trapping occurred in intact cells and that the interaction was very specific, it is highly likely that EGFR and Gab1 represent physiological SHP2 substrates. Therefore, the DM protein would serve as an important tool in future SHP2 studies, including identification of p190, p150, and p90.

Ullrich A. Zhao Z. Cell. 1996; 85: 15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) of SHP2 have not yet been identified. Thus, identification of such substrates would be a stepping stone toward elucidating the mechanism of action of SHP2 in RTK signaling.Substrate-trapping mutants of PTPs have been shown to be ideal reagents for substrate identification. It was demonstrated that such mutants of PTPs can be produced by mutation of Asp to Ala in the conserved WPD loop (38Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). For instance, Asp to Ala mutants of PTP1B, TC-PTP, and PTP-PEST helped identify EGFR, p52Shc, and p130Cas as candidate substrates, respectively (38Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc.

It was also demonstrated that a Cys to Ser mutation in the signature motif (41Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5910-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) makes PTPs become substrate trapping (42Zhou G. Denu J.M. Wu L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), but with less efficiency. Here, we report the development of a new trapping mutant for SHP2 by introducing Cys to Ser and Asp to Ala double mutations that were superior to the single Cys to Ser mutant. Surprisingly, and in contrast to widely held views, an Asp to Ala mutant of SHP2 was non-trapping. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the development of an efficient trapping mutant of SHP2 and the first demonstration in intact cells that EGFR and Gab1 are target substrates.RESULTSDespite intensive and extensive research to identify physiological substrates and define the site of action of SHP2, the problem has remained virtually unresolved. We reasoned that identification of the physiological substrates of SHP2 would be a logical step forward. For this, we produced an efficient trapping mutant of SHP2 that would be instrumental in identifying target phosphotyrosyl substrate proteins.Production of a Trapping Mutant of SHP2Previous reports showed that trapping mutants of PTPs can be produced by mutation of Asp to Ala in the conserved WPD loop (38Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). We utilized the same principle and introduced an Asp to Ala point mutation into WT-SHP2. WT-SHP2, D425A-SHP2, or C459S-SHP2, herein after referred to as WT, D425A, and C459S, respectively, were transfected into COS-1 cells, and EGF-induced coprecipitation of phosphotyrosyl proteins was analyzed by immunoblot. In cells transfected with the C459S construct, three phosphotyrosyl protein bands identified as p70, p120, and p170 were observed. In cells transfected with the WT or D425A, relatively weaker bands of p70 and p170 were observed. Reblotting with anti-SHP2 and anti-EGFR antibodies showed that the p70 and the p170 were SHP2 and the EGFR, respectively (data not shown). These results showed that the D425A protein was non-trapping.We hypothesized that the trapping ability of the C459S mutant might be improved by introducing an additional mutation. For this, we introduced a D425A mutation into the C459S mutant and produced a double mutant SHP2 (D425A/C459S-SHP2), herein after referred to as the DM protein. The DM protein, together with the above mentioned constructs, were transiently overexpressed in COS-1 cells, and expression was monitored by immunoblot; all were expressed at approximately five times that of the endogenous SHP2 (Fig. 1A,bottom). The pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was similar in all cases except p70, which was significantly intense in the C459S and the DM cells (Fig. 1A, top). Several phosphotyrosyl proteins coimmunoprecipitated with the DM protein, which were identified as p170, p150, p120 and p90 (Fig. 1B,top). Lower amounts of p170 and p120 also coprecipitated with the C459S protein as well. In the case of the WT or the D425A protein, a significantly lower amount of p170 only was observed. Reblotting with anti-EGFR and ant-SHP2 antibodies reconfirmed that p170 and p70 were EGFR and SHP2, respectively (Fig. 1B,middle and bottom). Interestingly, the tyrosine phosphorylation level of the D425A protein was similar to the WT, suggesting that it could be enzymatically active. By visually comparing band intensities (both anti-Tyr(P) and anti-EGFR blots), it was apparent that significantly higher amounts of phosphotyrosyl proteins coprecipitated with the DM protein, suggesting that the DM protein was the most efficient substrate-trapping mutant.Because COS-1 cells express higher amounts of the EGFR, which was the most tyrosine-phosphorylated protein upon EGF stimulation, it is possible that this might have influenced the interaction. To test this possibility, we conducted the same experiment in 293T cells, which express significantly lower amounts of the EGFR (Fig. 1C,top). As in COS-1 cells, four phosphotyrosyl proteins that correspond in molecular weight to p170, p150, p120, and p90 coimmunoprecipitated with the DM protein, and lower amounts of p170 and p120 coimmunoprecipitated with the C459S protein (Fig. 1D,top). Again, significantly lower amounts of p170 were detected with the vector, the WT, or the D425A proteins. Reprobing the membrane with anti-EGFR and anti-SHP2 antibodies confirmed that p170 and p70 were EGFR and SHP2, respectively (Fig. 1D,middle and bottom). Therefore, the trapping of EGFR by the DM protein was an inherent property of this mutant but not a concentration artifact. Furthermore, it is also important to note that the DM protein had no obvious effect on the overall tyrosine phosphorylation of the cellular proteins. The tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins trapped by the DM protein were a very specific subset of the overall tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (compare Fig. 1, A with B and C withD). This indicated that the DM protein was reacting in a very specific manner with the cellular proteins.Time Course Studies on the Trapping of EGFR by Mutant SHP2 ProteinsWe examined the dynamics of substrate trapping by the DM protein at various time points of stimulation. A higher amount of EGFR coprecipitated with the DM protein at all time points tested and seemed to accumulate over time (Fig. 2,top panel). Despite the presence of a high amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR and a comparable expression level of SHP2 constructs (Fig. 2, middle and bottom), a lower amount of EGFR coprecipitated with the C459S protein and did not show any increase over time. Similarly, a significantly lower amount of EGFR coprecipitated with the WT and D425A proteins. These findings suggested that the DM protein formed a stable complex with its target substrate EGFR, which would be a desirable characteristic to isolate and identify other SHP2 substrates.Figure 2EGFR trapped by the DM protein accumulated over time. Lysates from COS-1 cells transfected with the indicated plasmid constructs were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-SHP2 and immunoblotted (IB) with anti-EGFR (top). The same membrane was stripped and reblotted with anti-SHP2 to show immunoprecipitation of an equal amount of SHP2 in all lanes (bottom). Total cell lysate (TCL) was immunoblotted with anti-Tyr(P) (pY) to show the presence of an equal amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR in all stimulated cells (middle).

We thus determined the level of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in COS-1 cells transfected with the SHP2 constructs used in Fig. 1. Although the expression of all SHP2 proteins was comparable (Fig.3A, bottom), the tyrosine phosphorylation level of the EGFR was moderately higher only in the DM cells (Fig. 3A, top). Interestingly, overexpression of the WT protein did not result in global dephosphorylation of the EGFR (compare vector (V)versus WT, Fig. 3A, top), suggesting that only a few phosphotyrosine (pY, Fig. 3A,top) residues were targeted. To better compare these observations, band intensities were quantified. In the vector, the WT and the D425A transfected cells, the level of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was virtually identical, ∼50-fold over basal. However, in the C459S and the DM cells it was 60- and 90-fold over basal, respectively (Fig. 3B). When comparison was made between the vector, the WT, or the D425A and the C459S or the DM, the level of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in the C459S and the DM cells was 1.2 and 1.8-fold higher, respectively.Figure 3SHP2 partially dephosphorylated EGFR.

Maximum dephosphorylation was achieved at 5 μg of DNA per 6-cm plate of confluent COS-1 cells, and no further dephosphorylation was observed by raising the DNA concentration to 10 μg (Fig. 3C), indicating that SHP2 is not a global phosphatase. As expected, cells transfected with 10 μg of the DM construct did not show any dephosphorylation of the EGFR. These results were consistent with specific and partial dephosphorylation and suggested that the EGFR might be an in vivo substrate of SHP2.SHP2 Dephosphorylates EGFR and Gab1 in VitroTo further confirm that phosphotyrosyl proteins trapped by SHP2 are target substrates, we carried out an immunocomplex in vitrophosphatase assay. We concentrated only on the EGFR and Gab1, because these are the only identified substrates (Figs. 1 and 6) against which specific antibodies are available. EGFR from COS-1 cells stimulated with EGF or Gab1 from 3T3 cells stimulated with serum was immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody and then subjected to a PTP assay using varying concentrations of purified WT protein (see “Materials and Methods” for details). The WT protein partially dephosphorylated both the EGFR and Gab1, whereas the DM protein did not (Fig. 4, A and B,top). In both cases, the addition of five times more WT protein did not result in global dephosphorylation, further confirming that whether it is inside or outside the cell, SHP2 is very specific. Reblotting with anti-EGFR (Fig. 4A, bottom) or anti-Gab1 (Fig. 4B, bottom) showed that a comparable amount of protein was present in all lanes.Figure 6The DM protein identified Gab1 as its target substrate.

We treated SHP2-transfected COS-1 cells with another stimulus, namely 10% fetal calf serum. Anti-Tyr(P) blot showed trapping by the DM protein of four phosphotyrosyl proteins that were identified as p190, p150, p120, and p90 (Fig. 5A,top). What was different from the case with EGF-stimulated cells was the presence of p190 and the absence of p170 (EGFR), suggesting that SHP2 substrates vary depending on the stimulus. Despite comparable expression levels (Fig. 5A, bottom), a relatively lower amount of p190 and p90 only were trapped by the C459S protein. Furthermore, a significantly lower amount of p190 coprecipitated with the endogenous or overexpressed WT and the D425A proteins. For the purpose of comparing the COS-1 cell results with other cell type, we conducted a similar experiment in NIH-3T3 cells using only three of the SHP2 proteins. Again, the DM protein trapped four phosphotyrosyl proteins identified as p190, p150, p120, and p90 (Fig. 5B, top). In case of the C459S protein, p190 and a significantly lower amount of p150 and p90 were trapped. Some amount of p190 also coprecipitated with the WT protein, which may represent an SH2 domain-mediated interaction. These results indicated that the subset of SHP2 target substrates varies depending on the stimulus and/or cell type.Figure 5The DM protein identified four phosphotyrosyl proteins as its target substrates in serum-stimulated cells and only p190 in PDGF-stimulated cells. COS-1 (A andC) or NIH-3T3 (B and D) cells were transfected with an expression plasmid containing the indicated SHP2 constructs and stimulated either with serum or PDGF.

The hemagglutinin (HA) tag of wild type RPTPα and of constitutively dimeric, active RPTPα-F135C with a disulfide bond in the extracellular domain was not accessible for antibody, whereas the HA tag of constitutively dimeric, inactive RPTPα-P137C was. All three proteins were expressed on the plasma membrane to a similar extent, and the accessibility of their extracellular domains did not differ as determined by biotinylation studies.

Two antagonistically acting families of enzymes regulate phosphorylation of protein tyrosine residues, an important determinant for many cellular functions: protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTKprotein-tyrosine kinaseHAhemagglutininPTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorHEKhuman embryonic kidneyLARleukocyte common antigen-relatedRPTKreceptor-like PTKRPTPreceptor-like PTPROSreactive oxygen species1The abbreviations used are: PTKprotein-tyrosine kinaseHAhemagglutininPTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorHEKhuman embryonic kidneyLARleukocyte common antigen-relatedRPTKreceptor-like PTKRPTPreceptor-like PTPROSreactive oxygen species and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). PTKs catalyze the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, and PTPs catalyze the dephosphorylation. The classical PTPs can be subdivided into the cytoplasmic PTPs and the transmembrane PTPs (reviewed in Ref. 1Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Moller N.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Transmembrane PTPs, tentatively called receptor-like PTPs (RPTPs), are interesting because of their potential to signal across the membrane. Besides one transmembrane domain, most RPTPs possess two catalytic domains of which the first contains most of the catalytic activity. The RPTP extracellular domains vary greatly (2Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Clear evidence for ligands that regulate RPTP activity remains elusive. In some cases, as for the interaction between RPTPβ, leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR), and PTPς and their ligands contactin, laminin/nidogen, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, respectively, the binding compound is known, but the effect of the ligand on PTP activity needs to be established (3Aricescu A.R.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5219-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) reported an effect of Matrigel on DEP1 activity; however, the exact responsible compound still needs to be established. Only pleiotrophin, a heparin-binding cytokine, was reported to reduce RPTPβ/ζ activity, in that β-catenin phosphorylation was enhanced in cells expressing RPTPβ/ζ in response to pleiotrophin (7Meng K. Rodriguez-Pena A. Dimitrov T. Chen W. Yamin M. Noda M. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2603-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar).Dimerization induced by ligand binding is a well known regulatory mechanism for receptor PTK activity. In the absence of ligand, RPTK monomers are in equilibrium with RPTK dimers. A limited population of the RPTK dimers are in the active configuration, which becomes stabilized upon ligand binding and results in cross-phosphorylation and stimulation of PTK activity (reviewed in Refs. 8Jiang G. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R568-R571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar and 9Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar). The first evidence for regulation of RPTPs by dimerization came from studies with the RPTP CD45. Chimeric EGFR-CD45 with the extracellular domain of the EGFR fused to the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 is functionally inactivated by dimerization upon ligand binding (10Desai D.M. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 541-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In line with this, there is evidence for the regulation of RPTPα by dimerization. The crystal structure of RPTPα-D1 provided structural evidence that dimerization leads to inhibition of the catalytic activity of RPTPα because a wedge-like structure of one monomer inserts into the catalytic cleft of the other, thereby occluding the catalytic site (11Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In vivo activity studies with constitutively dimeric mutants confirm this hypothesis. In these mutants a single cysteine residue was introduced in the extracellular domain of RPTPα leading to the formation of a stable intermolecular disulfide bridge (12Jiang G. den Hertog J. Su J. Noel J. Sap J. Hunter T. Nature. 1999; 401: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A disulfide bridge at position 137 (RPTPα-P137C) resulted in reduced substrate dephosphorylation, whereas constructs with a disulfide bridge at position 135 (RPTPα-F135C) had activities similar to the wild type construct. These data indicate that dimerization of RPTPα only leads to inactivation of the catalytic activity if the rotational coupling of the dimer is such that the wedge of one monomer inserts into the catalytic cleft of the other (12Jiang G. den Hertog J. Su J. Noel J. Sap J. Hunter T. Nature. 1999; 401: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the wedge of EGFR-CD45 chimeras (13Majeti R. Bilwes A.M. Noel J.P. Hunter T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 279: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and constitutive dimer mutants of RPTPα (12Jiang G. den Hertog J. Su J. Noel J. Sap J. Hunter T. Nature. 1999; 401: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) indeed abolished the dimerization-induced inhibition of PTP activity. Taken together, RPTPs can be regulated by dimerization. Evidence is accumulating that RPTPs indeed dimerize in vivo. Cross-linking experiments (14Jiang G. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5917-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis (15Tertoolen L.G. Blanchetot C. Jiang G. Overvoorde J. Gadella T.W.J. Hunter T. den Hertog J. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) indicate that RPTPα constitutively forms dimers in living cells. Similarly, CD45 forms dimers in living cells, as demonstrated by chemical cross-linking and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis (16Dornan S. Sebestyen Z. Gamble J. Nagy P. Bodnar A.

Interestingly, dimerization of distinct alternatively spliced isoforms of CD45 is different (18Xu Z. Weiss A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 764-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), suggesting regulation of dimerization at the level of alternative splicing. Rotational coupling appears to be an important determinant for RPTP activity, and it will therefore be interesting to see how rotational coupling in RPTP dimers is regulated.Recent studies indicate that the second catalytic domain of RPTPα, RPTPα-D2, may have a regulatory role in dimer conformation. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation techniques, we found that oxidative stress leads to opening up of D2, resulting in the formation of more stable, inactive dimers (19Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Importantly, as shown by bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate cross-linking experiments, H2O2 does not induce de novo dimerization (19Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The H2O2-induced conformational change is dependent on the catalytic site cysteine in RPTPα-D2, Cys723, suggesting that direct oxidation of this residue underlies the observed effects.Here we report that antibody binding to the HA tag within the N-terminal part of the ectodomain of plasma membrane localized RPTPα reflected the state of rotational coupling. Although the epitope tag was masked in wild type RPTPα and constitutively dimeric, active RPTPα-F135C with a single cysteine in the extracellular domain, the epitope tag in inactive dimeric RPTPα-P137C was accessible, suggesting that accessibility of the HA tag was dependent on rotational coupling. H2O2 induced accessibility of the HA tag in wild type RPTPα. Masking of the epitope tag was dependent on residues 20–42 in the extracellular domain and on dimerization of RPTPα. RPTPα-D2 and more specifically the catalytic site Cys in RPTPα-D2, Cys723, were required for H2O2-induced HA tag accessibility. Our results suggest that a conformational change in the cytoplasmic domain of RPTPα leads to a change in the conformation of the ectodomain of RPTPα and therefore provide evidence that RPTPs have the potential for inside-out signaling.DISCUSSIONHere we report that the conformation of the extracellular domain of RPTPα dimers changed in response to H2O2treatment, reflecting the catalytic state of RPTPα, active or inactive. We provide evidence that the catalytic site cysteine in the membrane-distal PTP domain, RPTPα-D2, is required for this effect. Our results suggest that redox signaling regulates rotational coupling of RPTPα dimers, thereby reversibly switching RPTPα from an active to an inactive dimeric state.We developed an assay to assess accessibility of the epitope tag in the ectodomain of HA-RPTPα on living cells. Surprisingly, this assay allowed us to discriminate between active and inactive constitutively dimeric conformations of RPTPα (Fig. 2). Moreover, H2O2 treatment of cells significantly increased the accessibility of the HA tag in HA-RPTPα (Fig. 3), concomitant with a loss of catalytic activity in response to H2O2 treatment. The effect of H2O2 treatment on the antibody binding characteristics of the HA-tagged ectodomain is dependent on Cys723 in RPTPα-D2 (Fig. 8), suggesting that the conformational change in RPTPα-D2 that we reported previously (19Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) is involved. The N-terminal part of the extracellular domain was required for steric hindrance of antibody binding to the epitope tag, as shown using mutants with deletions in the extracellular domain. It is noteworthy that deletion of residues 43–142, rendering an extracellular domain of only 23 residues, which is of a size similar to that of the ectodomain of RPTPε, masked the epitope tag in RPTPα-Δ43–142, whereas the ectodomain of RPTPε did not. Especially residues immediately to the C-terminal side of the epitope tag are involved in masking, because deletion of residues 20–130, but not residues 43–142, rendered the HA tag accessible (Fig. 6), raising the possibility that intramolecular interactions are involved. However, H2O2-induced accessibility of the epitope tag is reversible, and the kinetics are highly similar to H2O2-induced stabilization of RPTPα dimers (Fig. 7), suggesting that dimerization is required for steric hindrance of antibody binding. In addition, deletions in the wedge structure that annihilate dimerization of RPTPα (14Jiang G. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5917-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) specifically abolished masking of the epitope tag (Fig. 5). Moreover, the short extracellular domain of RPTPε did not mask the RPTPα ectodomain in RPTPα-RPTPε heterodimers. Therefore, we conclude that intermolecular interactions, likely mediated by direct interactions of the ectodomains in RPTPα dimers, mask the epitope tag in the extracellular domain of RPTPα.Taken together, based on our results, we propose a model for the effects of H2O2 on the conformation of RPTPα dimers (Fig. 9). In the prestimulation state RPTPα exists as a preformed, active dimer. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer and chemical cross-linkers, we have demonstrated that RPTPα dimerization is extensive in the prestimulation state (15Tertoolen L.G. Blanchetot C. Jiang G. Overvoorde J. Gadella T.W.J. Hunter T. den Hertog J. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The fact that the epitope tag is not accessible in the prestimulation state again suggests that most RPTPα is dimeric. In addition to a conformational change in RPTPα-D2 leading to stabilization of RPTPα dimers (19Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we demonstrate here that H2O2 treatment alters the conformation of the extracellular domain from a state resembling active RPTPα-F135C to a state resembling inactive RPTPα-P137C. Our results suggest that oxidative stress induces a rapid change in rotational coupling, which slowly reverts to the prestimulation state upon reduction of RPTPα.The function of the extracellular domain of RPTPα remains to be determined. Both RPTPα and RPTPε are characterized by their short, highly glycosylated ectodomains. The extracellular domain may serve to stabilize the RPTP in the plasma membrane. Subcellular localization may be a mechanism to provide substrate selectivity for PTPs. This has been established by localization-function studies with RPTPα and RPTPε and their corresponding cytoplasmic forms (24Andersen J.N. Elson A. Lammers R. Romer J. Clausen J.T. Moller K.B. Moller N.P. Biochem. J. 2001. 2001; 354: 581-590Google Scholar) and in studies addressing the effect of calpain-induced cleavage of RPTPα and RPTPε that occurs in the intracellular juxtamembrane domain of the RPTPs (25Gil-Henn H. Volohonsky G. Elson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31772-31779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, previous studies with EGFR-RPTPα chimeras suggest that the RPTPα ectodomain does not solely serve as a membrane localizer but may also confer ligand-dependent regulatory mechanisms to RPTPα (26Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).A conformational change of the ectodomain as the result of a change in conformation of the intracellular C-terminal domain may change binding characteristics of RPTPα to its putative ligand. Conversely, ligands may bind to the extracellular domain of RPTPα, thereby changing the conformation of the extracellular domain and shifting rotational coupling, leading to a state resembling the stabilized dimer conformation in the cytoplasmic domain and thus to inactivation of RPTPα activity. However, bona fide ligands have not been reported yet for RPTPα. Only the GPI-linked protein contactin was reported to bind to the ectodomain of RPTPα in cis (27Zeng L. D'Alessandri L. Kalousek M.B. Vaughan L. Pallen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, co-transfection of contactin did not affect accessibility of RPTPα in our hands (data not shown). Our results suggest that RPTPα is capable of conferring a signal from inside cells outwards. Inside-out signaling is a new concept for RPTPs; however, this phenomenon is well known for signal transduction by integrins (reviewed in Refs. 28Miranti C.K. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E83-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar and 29Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Integrins not only transduce signals in response to extracellular matrix interactions from the outside of the cells inwards, but there is also information flowing from the inside of the cells outwards. Different cellular conditions affect the conformation of the extracellular domain of integrins, thereby affecting their affinity for their ligands. Our results suggest that RPTPs may be regulated in a similar fashion.Redox signaling is emerging as an important regulator of PTP activity (30Xu D. Rovira I.I. Finkel T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 251-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Many PTPs have been demonstrated to be inactivated by oxidation of their catalytic site cysteines (31Caselli A. Marzocchini R. Camici G. Manao G. Moneti G. Pieraccini G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32554-32560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 32Denu J.M. Tanner K.G.

Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in response to physiological stimuli, such as growth factors, and the levels of ROS are sufficient to inactivate PTPs (35Chiarugi P. Fiaschi T.

Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Regulation of PTPs by ROS is rapid and reversible. It appears that regulation of RPTPα and perhaps other RPTPs by ROS is more complex, involving not only direct oxidation of the catalytic site cysteine. Previously, we demonstrated that H2O2induced stabilization of RPTPα dimerization, which is responsible for complete inactivation of RPTPα. Here, we demonstrate a change in the ectodomain of RPTPα in response to H2O2. Presumably, reduction of the catalytic site cysteine after oxidation is rapid in cells because of the highly reducing intracellular milieu. The H2O2-induced conformational changes revert slowly to the prestimulation state and may help to sustain RPTPα in an inactive conformation.Not only RPTPα but also other RPTPs may be regulated by conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain. We have recently shown that H2O2 induced a conformational change in LAR-D2 as well (39Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. Overvoorde J. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47263-47269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see whether the conformational change in LAR-D2 is reflected by a conformational change of the ectodomain. Taken together, our results suggest that redox signaling regulates rotational coupling of RPTPα implicating that RPTPα has the capacity for inside-out signaling. It will be interesting to see whether redox signaling regulates rotational coupling of other RPTPs as well. Two antagonistically acting families of enzymes regulate phosphorylation of protein tyrosine residues, an important determinant for many cellular functions: protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTKprotein-tyrosine kinaseHAhemagglutininPTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorHEKhuman embryonic kidneyLARleukocyte common antigen-relatedRPTKreceptor-like PTKRPTPreceptor-like PTPROSreactive oxygen species1The abbreviations used are: PTKprotein-tyrosine kinaseHAhemagglutininPTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorHEKhuman embryonic kidneyLARleukocyte common antigen-relatedRPTKreceptor-like PTKRPTPreceptor-like PTPROSreactive oxygen species and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). PTKs catalyze the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, and PTPs catalyze the dephosphorylation. The classical PTPs can be subdivided into the cytoplasmic PTPs and the transmembrane PTPs (reviewed in Ref. 1Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Moller N.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Transmembrane PTPs, tentatively called receptor-like PTPs (RPTPs), are interesting because of their potential to signal across the membrane. Besides one transmembrane domain, most RPTPs possess two catalytic domains of which the first contains most of the catalytic activity. The RPTP extracellular domains vary greatly (2Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Clear evidence for ligands that regulate RPTP activity remains elusive. In some cases, as for the interaction between RPTPβ, leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR), and PTPς and their ligands contactin, laminin/nidogen, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, respectively, the binding compound is known, but the effect of the ligand on PTP activity needs to be established (3Aricescu A.R. McKinnell I.W. Halfter W. Stoker A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1881-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4O'Grady P. Thai T.C. Saito H. J.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5219-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) reported an effect of Matrigel on DEP1 activity; however, the exact responsible compound still needs to be established. Only pleiotrophin, a heparin-binding cytokine, was reported to reduce RPTPβ/ζ activity, in that β-catenin phosphorylation was enhanced in cells expressing RPTPβ/ζ in response to pleiotrophin (7Meng K. Rodriguez-Pena A. Dimitrov T. Chen W. Yamin M. Noda M. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2603-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). protein-tyrosine kinase hemagglutinin protein-tyrosine phosphatase epidermal growth factor receptor human embryonic kidney leukocyte common antigen-related receptor-like PTK receptor-like PTP reactive oxygen species protein-tyrosine kinase hemagglutinin protein-tyrosine phosphatase epidermal growth factor receptor human embryonic kidney leukocyte common antigen-related receptor-like PTK receptor-like PTP reactive oxygen species Dimerization induced by ligand binding is a well known regulatory mechanism for receptor PTK activity. In the absence of ligand, RPTK monomers are in equilibrium with RPTK dimers. A limited population of the RPTK dimers are in the active configuration, which becomes stabilized upon ligand binding and results in cross-phosphorylation and stimulation of PTK activity (reviewed in Refs. 8Jiang G. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R568-R571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar and 9Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar). The first evidence for regulation of RPTPs by dimerization came from studies with the RPTP CD45. Chimeric EGFR-CD45 with the extracellular domain of the EGFR fused to the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 is functionally inactivated by dimerization upon ligand binding (10Desai D.M. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 541-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In line with this, there is evidence for the regulation of RPTPα by dimerization. The crystal structure of RPTPα-D1 provided structural evidence that dimerization leads to inhibition of the catalytic activity of RPTPα because a wedge-like structure of one monomer inserts into the catalytic cleft of the other, thereby occluding the catalytic site (11Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In vivo activity studies with constitutively dimeric mutants confirm this hypothesis. In these mutants a single cysteine residue was introduced in the extracellular domain of RPTPα leading to the formation of a stable intermolecular disulfide bridge (12Jiang G. den Hertog J. Su J. Noel J. Sap J. Hunter T. Nature. 1999; 401: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A disulfide bridge at position 137 (RPTPα-P137C) resulted in reduced substrate dephosphorylation, whereas constructs with a disulfide bridge at position 135 (RPTPα-F135C) had activities similar to the wild type construct. These data indicate that dimerization of RPTPα only leads to inactivation of the catalytic activity if the rotational coupling of the dimer is such that the wedge of one monomer inserts into the catalytic cleft of the other (12Jiang G. den Hertog J. Su J. Noel J. Sap J. Hunter T. Nature. 1999; 401: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the wedge of EGFR-CD45 chimeras (13Majeti R. Bilwes A.M. Noel J.P. Hunter T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 279: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and constitutive dimer mutants of RPTPα (12Jiang G. den Hertog J. Su J. Noel J. Sap J. Hunter T. Nature. 1999; 401: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) indeed abolished the dimerization-induced inhibition of PTP activity. Taken together, RPTPs can be regulated by dimerization. Evidence is accumulating that RPTPs indeed dimerize in vivo. Cross-linking experiments (14Jiang G. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5917-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis (15Tertoolen L.G. Blanchetot C. Jiang G. Overvoorde J. Gadella T.W.J. Hunter T. den Hertog J. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) indicate that RPTPα constitutively forms dimers in living cells. Similarly, CD45 forms dimers in living cells, as demonstrated by chemical cross-linking and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis (16Dornan S. Sebestyen Z. Gamble J. Nagy P. Bodnar A. Alldridge L. Doe S. Holmes N. Goff L.K. Beverley P. Szollosi J. Alexander D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1912-1918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Takeda A.

Interestingly, dimerization of distinct alternatively spliced isoforms of CD45 is different (18Xu Z. Weiss A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 764-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), suggesting regulation of dimerization at the level of alternative splicing. Rotational coupling appears to be an important determinant for RPTP activity, and it will therefore be interesting to see how rotational coupling in RPTP dimers is regulated. Recent studies indicate that the second catalytic domain of RPTPα, RPTPα-D2, may have a regulatory role in dimer conformation. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation techniques, we found that oxidative stress leads to opening up of D2, resulting in the formation of more stable, inactive dimers (19Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Importantly, as shown by bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate cross-linking experiments, H2O2 does not induce de novo dimerization (19Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The H2O2-induced conformational change is dependent on the catalytic site cysteine in RPTPα-D2, Cys723, suggesting that direct oxidation of this residue underlies the observed effects. Here we report that antibody binding to the HA tag within the N-terminal part of the ectodomain of plasma membrane localized RPTPα reflected the state of rotational coupling. Although the epitope tag was masked in wild type RPTPα and constitutively dimeric, active RPTPα-F135C with a single cysteine in the extracellular domain, the epitope tag in inactive dimeric RPTPα-P137C was accessible, suggesting that accessibility of the HA tag was dependent on rotational coupling. H2O2 induced accessibility of the HA tag in wild type RPTPα. Masking of the epitope tag was dependent on residues 20–42 in the extracellular domain and on dimerization of RPTPα. RPTPα-D2 and more specifically the catalytic site Cys in RPTPα-D2, Cys723, were required for H2O2-induced HA tag accessibility. Our results suggest that a conformational change in the cytoplasmic domain of RPTPα leads to a change in the conformation of the ectodomain of RPTPα and therefore provide evidence that RPTPs have the potential for inside-out signaling. DISCUSSIONHere we report that the conformation of the extracellular domain of RPTPα dimers changed in response to H2O2treatment, reflecting the catalytic state of RPTPα, active or inactive. We provide evidence that the catalytic site cysteine in the membrane-distal PTP domain, RPTPα-D2, is required for this effect. Our results suggest that redox signaling regulates rotational coupling of RPTPα dimers, thereby reversibly switching RPTPα from an active to an inactive dimeric state.We developed an assay to assess accessibility of the epitope tag in the ectodomain of HA-RPTPα on living cells. Surprisingly, this assay allowed us to discriminate between active and inactive constitutively dimeric conformations of RPTPα (Fig. 2). Moreover, H2O2 treatment of cells significantly increased the accessibility of the HA tag in HA-RPTPα (Fig. 3), concomitant with a loss of catalytic activity in response to H2O2 treatment. The effect of H2O2 treatment on the antibody binding characteristics of the HA-tagged ectodomain is dependent on Cys723 in RPTPα-D2 (Fig. 8), suggesting that the conformational change in RPTPα-D2 that we reported previously (19Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) is involved. The N-terminal part of the extracellular domain was required for steric hindrance of antibody binding to the epitope tag, as shown using mutants with deletions in the extracellular domain. It is noteworthy that deletion of residues 43–142, rendering an extracellular domain of only 23 residues, which is of a size similar to that of the ectodomain of RPTPε, masked the epitope tag in RPTPα-Δ43–142, whereas the ectodomain of RPTPε did not. Especially residues immediately to the C-terminal side of the epitope tag are involved in masking, because deletion of residues 20–130, but not residues 43–142, rendered the HA tag accessible (Fig. 6), raising the possibility that intramolecular interactions are involved. However, H2O2-induced accessibility of the epitope tag is reversible, and the kinetics are highly similar to H2O2-induced stabilization of RPTPα dimers (Fig. 7), suggesting that dimerization is required for steric hindrance of antibody binding. In addition, deletions in the wedge structure that annihilate dimerization of RPTPα (14Jiang G. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5917-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) specifically abolished masking of the epitope tag (Fig. 5). Moreover, the short extracellular domain of RPTPε did not mask the RPTPα ectodomain in RPTPα-RPTPε heterodimers. Therefore, we conclude that intermolecular interactions, likely mediated by direct interactions of the ectodomains in RPTPα dimers, mask the epitope tag in the extracellular domain of RPTPα.Taken together, based on our results, we propose a model for the effects of H2O2 on the conformation of RPTPα dimers (Fig. 9). In the prestimulation state RPTPα exists as a preformed, active dimer. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer and chemical cross-linkers, we have demonstrated that RPTPα dimerization is extensive in the prestimulation state (15Tertoolen L.G. Blanchetot C. Jiang G.

Our results suggest that oxidative stress induces a rapid change in rotational coupling, which slowly reverts to the prestimulation state upon reduction of RPTPα.The function of the extracellular domain of RPTPα remains to be determined. Both RPTPα and RPTPε are characterized by their short, highly glycosylated ectodomains. The extracellular domain may serve to stabilize the RPTP in the plasma membrane. Subcellular localization may be a mechanism to provide substrate selectivity for PTPs.

However, previous studies with EGFR-RPTPα chimeras suggest that the RPTPα ectodomain does not solely serve as a membrane localizer but may also confer ligand-dependent regulatory mechanisms to RPTPα (26Blanchetot C. den Hertog J.

It appears that regulation of RPTPα and perhaps other RPTPs by ROS is more complex, involving not only direct oxidation of the catalytic site cysteine. Previously, we demonstrated that H2O2induced stabilization of RPTPα dimerization, which is responsible for complete inactivation of RPTPα. Here, we demonstrate a change in the ectodomain of RPTPα in response to H2O2. Presumably, reduction of the catalytic site cysteine after oxidation is rapid in cells because of the highly reducing intracellular milieu. The H2O2-induced conformational changes revert slowly to the prestimulation state and may help to sustain RPTPα in an inactive conformation.Not only RPTPα but also other RPTPs may be regulated by conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain. We have recently shown that H2O2 induced a conformational change in LAR-D2 as well (39Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. Overvoorde J. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47263-47269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see whether the conformational change in LAR-D2 is reflected by a conformational change of the ectodomain. Taken together, our results suggest that redox signaling regulates rotational coupling of RPTPα implicating that RPTPα has the capacity for inside-out signaling. It will be interesting to see whether redox signaling regulates rotational coupling of other RPTPs as well. Here we report that the conformation of the extracellular domain of RPTPα dimers changed in response to H2O2treatment, reflecting the catalytic state of RPTPα, active or inactive. We provide evidence that the catalytic site cysteine in the membrane-distal PTP domain, RPTPα-D2, is required for this effect. Our results suggest that redox signaling regulates rotational coupling of RPTPα dimers, thereby reversibly switching RPTPα from an active to an inactive dimeric state. We developed an assay to assess accessibility of the epitope tag in the ectodomain of HA-RPTPα on living cells. Surprisingly, this assay allowed us to discriminate between active and inactive constitutively dimeric conformations of RPTPα (Fig. 2). Moreover, H2O2 treatment of cells significantly increased the accessibility of the HA tag in HA-RPTPα (Fig. 3), concomitant with a loss of catalytic activity in response to H2O2 treatment. The effect of H2O2 treatment on the antibody binding characteristics of the HA-tagged ectodomain is dependent on Cys723 in RPTPα-D2 (Fig. 8), suggesting that the conformational change in RPTPα-D2 that we reported previously (19Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) is involved. The N-terminal part of the extracellular domain was required for steric hindrance of antibody binding to the epitope tag, as shown using mutants with deletions in the extracellular domain. It is noteworthy that deletion of residues 43–142, rendering an extracellular domain of only 23 residues, which is of a size similar to that of the ectodomain of RPTPε, masked the epitope tag in RPTPα-Δ43–142, whereas the ectodomain of RPTPε did not. Especially residues immediately to the C-terminal side of the epitope tag are involved in masking, because deletion of residues 20–130, but not residues 43–142, rendered the HA tag accessible (Fig. 6), raising the possibility that intramolecular interactions are involved. However, H2O2-induced accessibility of the epitope tag is reversible, and the kinetics are highly similar to H2O2-induced stabilization of RPTPα dimers (Fig. 7), suggesting that dimerization is required for steric hindrance of antibody binding. In addition, deletions in the wedge structure that annihilate dimerization of RPTPα (14Jiang G. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5917-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) specifically abolished masking of the epitope tag (Fig. 5). Moreover, the short extracellular domain of RPTPε did not mask the RPTPα ectodomain in RPTPα-RPTPε heterodimers. Therefore, we conclude that intermolecular interactions, likely mediated by direct interactions of the ectodomains in RPTPα dimers, mask the epitope tag in the extracellular domain of RPTPα. Taken together, based on our results, we propose a model for the effects of H2O2 on the conformation of RPTPα dimers (Fig. 9). In the prestimulation state RPTPα exists as a preformed, active dimer. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer and chemical cross-linkers, we have demonstrated that RPTPα dimerization is extensive in the prestimulation state (15Tertoolen L.G. Blanchetot C. Jiang G. Overvoorde J. Gadella T.W.J. Hunter T. den Hertog J. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The fact that the epitope tag is not accessible in the prestimulation state again suggests that most RPTPα is dimeric. In addition to a conformational change in RPTPα-D2 leading to stabilization of RPTPα dimers (19Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we demonstrate here that H2O2 treatment alters the conformation of the extracellular domain from a state resembling active RPTPα-F135C to a state resembling inactive RPTPα-P137C. Our results suggest that oxidative stress induces a rapid change in rotational coupling, which slowly reverts to the prestimulation state upon reduction of RPTPα. The function of the extracellular domain of RPTPα remains to be determined. Both RPTPα and RPTPε are characterized by their short, highly glycosylated ectodomains. The extracellular domain may serve to stabilize the RPTP in the plasma membrane. Subcellular localization may be a mechanism to provide substrate selectivity for PTPs. This has been established by localization-function studies with RPTPα and RPTPε and their corresponding cytoplasmic forms (24Andersen J.N. Elson A. Lammers R. Romer J. Clausen J.T. Moller K.B. Moller N.P. Biochem. J. 2001. 2001; 354: 581-590Google Scholar) and in studies addressing the effect of calpain-induced cleavage of RPTPα and RPTPε that occurs in the intracellular juxtamembrane domain of the RPTPs (25Gil-Henn H. Volohonsky G. Elson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31772-31779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, previous studies with EGFR-RPTPα chimeras suggest that the RPTPα ectodomain does not solely serve as a membrane localizer but may also confer ligand-dependent regulatory mechanisms to RPTPα (26Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A conformational change of the ectodomain as the result of a change in conformation of the intracellular C-terminal domain may change binding characteristics of RPTPα to its putative ligand. Conversely, ligands may bind to the extracellular domain of RPTPα, thereby changing the conformation of the extracellular domain and shifting rotational coupling, leading to a state resembling the stabilized dimer conformation in the cytoplasmic domain and thus to inactivation of RPTPα activity. However, bona fide ligands have not been reported yet for RPTPα. Only the GPI-linked protein contactin was reported to bind to the ectodomain of RPTPα in cis (27Zeng L. D'Alessandri L. Kalousek M.B. Vaughan L. Pallen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, co-transfection of contactin did not affect accessibility of RPTPα in our hands (data not shown). Our results suggest that RPTPα is capable of conferring a signal from inside cells outwards. Inside-out signaling is a new concept for RPTPs; however, this phenomenon is well known for signal transduction by integrins (reviewed in Refs. 28Miranti C.K. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E83-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar and 29Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Integrins not only transduce signals in response to extracellular matrix interactions from the outside of the cells inwards, but there is also information flowing from the inside of the cells outwards. Different cellular conditions affect the conformation of the extracellular domain of integrins, thereby affecting their affinity for their ligands. Our results suggest that RPTPs may be regulated in a similar fashion. Redox signaling is emerging as an important regulator of PTP activity (30Xu D. Rovira I.I. Finkel T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 251-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Many PTPs have been demonstrated to be inactivated by oxidation of their catalytic site cysteines (31Caselli A. Marzocchini R. Camici G. Manao G. Moneti G. Pieraccini G. Ramponi G. J. Biol.

Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in response to physiological stimuli, such as growth factors, and the levels of ROS are sufficient to inactivate PTPs (35Chiarugi P. Fiaschi T.

During the interferon (IFN) response, translational repression due to phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α, eIF2α, by the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR, constitutes a means of inhibiting viral replication. Here we show that the transient nature of the IFN response against acute viral infections is regulated, at least in part, by RNase L. During the IFN antiviral response in RNase L-null cells, PKR mRNA stability was enhanced, PKR induction was increased, and the phosphorylated form of eIF2α appeared with extended kinetics compared with similarly treated wild type cells. An enhanced IFN response in RNase L-null cells was also demonstrated by monitoring inhibition of viral protein synthesis. Furthermore, ectopic expression of RNase L from a plasmid vector prevented the IFN induction of PKR. These results suggest a role for RNase L in the transient control of the IFN response and possibly of other cytokine and stress responses.

Hilton D.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 70: 348-356PubMed Google Scholar) and mRNA turnover regulation by the AU-rich elements in the 3′-untranslated regions (2Bakheet T. Frevel M. Williams B.R.G. Greer W. Khabar K.S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The IFN antiviral response is a highly regulated process involving the transient inhibition of viral and cellular protein synthesis. The translational inhibition is mediated predominately by the activity of PKR, the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase. PKR is a serine/threonine protein kinase of 65 and 68 kDa in murine and human cells, respectively, that is induced by IFN treatment of cells and phosphorylates itself and other proteins, notably eIF2α, in response to viral double-stranded RNA (3Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Thomas N.S. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Hovanessian A.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). DsRNA is produced as the replicative intermediates of many RNA viruses and also by annealing of complementary RNA strands transcribed from some DNA viruses (3Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Thomas N.S. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Hovanessian A.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated eIF2α sequesters the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, which becomes trapped as inactive complex with GDP resulting in translational arrest (4Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7928-7934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Meurs E.F. Watanabe Y. Kadereit S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Chong K. Williams B.R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5804-5814Crossref Google Scholar).Among the principal effectors of the IFN-induced antiviral state are the 2′,5′-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetases that convert ATP to 2-5A, activators of RNase L, in response to viral double-stranded RNA (6Kerr I.M. Brown R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 7Silverman R.H. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structure and Function. Academic Press, New York1997: 515-551Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, 2-5A is an alarmone that alerts the cells to the presence of virus by signaling to RNase L. Both RNase L and PKR have been implicated in the action of IFN-α against a variety of viruses (reviewed in Refs. 8Biron C.A. Sen G.C. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Publishers, Philadelphia2001: 321-352Google Scholar and 9Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Shreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). RNase L is widely distributed in different tissues, and it has been suggested that low levels of 2-5A lead to RNase L-mediated selective degradation of viral mRNA (10Li X.L. Blackford J.A. Hassel B.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2752-2759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas higher levels may lead to broader effects such as cleavage of 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNAs (11Wreschner D.H. James T.C. Silverman R.H. Kerr I.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 1571-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). During the course of experiments on the role of RNase L in the inhibition of viral protein synthesis during acute infections, we observed that an absence of RNase L led to selective stabilization of PKR mRNA, extended kinetics of eIF2α phosphorylation, and potent inhibition of viral protein synthesis. Our findings suggest that RNase L truncates and limits the induction of PKR, possibly contributing to the transient nature of the IFN response against viral infections.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Viral Infections, and IFN Treatments—RNase L+/+ and RNase L-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines were of mixed or C57BL/6 genetic backgrounds. The cell lines are post-crisis derivatives of primary MEFs as described previously (12Zhou A. Paranjape J. Brown T.L. Nie H. Naik S. Dong B. Chang A. Trapp B. Fairchild R. Colmenares C. Silverman R.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6355-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). MEFs were cultured in dMEM with high glucose supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD). Bone marrow macrophages collected from the femurs of RNase L+/+ and RNase L-/- mice, both on a background of C57BL/6, were cultured in L-cell-conditioned medium for 8 days and plated at a density of 106 cells per 10-cm plate. WISH cell line (HeLa markers) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics.Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, Indiana strain) were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Virus preparations were clarified by low speed centrifugation, filtered through 0.22-μm membranes for sterility, and titrated on VERO (African Green Monkey Kidney cell line, ATCC) with resultant titers of 2 × 109 and 8 × 108 plaque forming units/ml for EMCV and VSV, respectively. Viruses were aliquoted and stored at -70 °C until use.Hybrid IFN-α BBDB, equally active on mouse and human cells, was a generous gift from H. K. Hochkeppel (Norvatis Pharma AG) (13Gangemi J.D. Lazdins J. Dietrich F.M. Matter A. Poncioni B. Hochkeppel H.K. J. Interferon. Res. 1989; 9: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The specific activity, determined by titrating on human amnion cells (WISH) calibrated with National Institutes of Health standard IFN, Gxa01-901-535, was 1.3 × 109 IU/mg using the manufacturer's reported amount of pure IFN weight.Monitoring Phosphorylation of the α Subunit of eIF2—Cells were incubated with or without IFN-α (1000 units/ml). Proteins were extracted in ice-cold lysis buffer. Kinase reactions were in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 mg/ml BSA, 5% glycerol, 100 IU aprotinin, 10 μm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl, 2 mm MnCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 100 ng/ml of poly(I)·poly(C) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. To monitor eIF2α levels, cells were incubated with or without IFN-α and infected with EMCV (m.o.i. = 10) for 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 h followed by lysing the cells in ice-cold lysis buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-10% acrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Membranes were blocked with buffer containing 2% BSA/0.5% Tween-20 and probed with anti-phospho-eIF2-α antiserum (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) by incubating the membrane overnight at 4 °C with antibody diluted in the blocking buffer. The antibody specifically detects eIF2α only when phosphorylated at serine 51, because the antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to residues surrounding Ser-51 of human eIF2α. Secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase) was used for immunodetection and visualization (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Buckingham, UK). Rabbit Antibodies to total eIFα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were also used to probe Western blots.Monitoring Viral Protein Synthesis—IFN-mediated inhibition of viral protein synthesis was determined in the presence of actinomycin D to selectively inhibit cellular transcription and thereby reduce cellular protein synthesis. Confluent MEFs (2 × 105 cells per well) in 24-well plates (Linbro, Flow Laboratories) were incubated in maintenance medium (DMEM plus 2% FBS) in the absence or presence of IFN-α at 1000 units/ml for 20 h. EMCV was incubated with the cells for 1 h. Unadsorbed virus was removed, and cells were incubated for 4 h with maintenance medium containing 5 μg/ml of actinomycin D (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The medium was replaced with cysteine/methionine-free medium supplemented with 6 μCi of [35S]cysteine/methionine (Promix, Amersham Biosciences). The cells were incubated for a further 1.5 h, media were removed, and proteins were extracted in gel sample buffer.Infectious Virus Yield Assays—Confluent cells were infected for 1 h, unadsorbed virus was removed by washing monolayers with PBS containing 2% FBS, and infections were continued in dMEM with high glucose supplemented with 5% FBS and antibiotics. Cell lysates were obtained by repeated freezing and thawing, and supernatants (containing both intracellular and extracellular viral particles) were collected after centrifugation at 300 × g at 4 °C. Infectious virus in the clarified supernatants were quantitated by plaque assays after titration on confluent monolayers of VERO cells grown in 24-well plates with overlay MEM medium containing agar (Sigma). The plates were fixed and stained with crystal violet, and plaques were counted.Immunoprecipitations and Autophosphorylation of PKR—Confluent cells (4 × 10 5 cells per well) in 12-well tissue culture dishes (Linbro) were incubated with or without IFN-α (1000 units/ml) for different periods of time. Cultures were incubated for 24 h in methionine-free minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% dialyzed FBS and 10 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). After washing, cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Lysates were incubated with anti-PKR antibody (Santa Cruz; 1/250 dilution), and immune complexes containing PKR were immobilized on protein-A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. PKR was eluted by boiling in gel sample buffer and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and poly(dI)·poly(dC) in a kinase reaction buffer for 30 min.SDS-PAGE—Equal amounts, as determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA), of proteins or equal amounts of the immunoprecipitation lysates were electrophoresed in 12% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were fixed overnight, washed, dried, and visualized by autoradiography (Kodak XAR film, Kodak, Rochester, NY) at -70 °C. Protein molecular weight markers (14C-methylated, 14–220 kDa) were used to verify the size of viral proteins. In the case of phosphorylated STAT-1, protein was visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences).Assay of PKR Levels in Mice Treated with IFN-α—Female RNase L+/+ (Jackson Lab, C57/bl6) and female RNase L-/- (C57/bl6) mice at 10 weeks of age were injected by the intraperitoneal route with 5 × 105 units of IFN-α (BBDB) in 200 μl of PBS. Organs (spleen and thymus) were removed from sacrificed mice that were either untreated or IFN-α treated for 16, 48, and 72 h. Protein (200 μg) prepared from frozen (-70 °C) spleens and thymuses were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membrane, and probed with rabbit anti-human PKR (cross-reactive with mouse PKR) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and visualized (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The same blots were re-probed with goat anti-β-actin anti-goat-HRP.Transient Transfection of Human RNase L—Semi-confluent WISH (HeLa markers) line was assessed for transfection efficiency using green fluorescent protein vector (Invitrogen). Semi-confluent WISH (HeLa markers) was transfected with either pcDNA3.1 vector or pcDNA3.1 containing full-length human RNase L cDNA. Transfections were performed in serum-free medium using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 6 h followed by replacing the medium with serum-supplemented medium. After 18 h incubation, human recombinant IFN-α2a (500 IU/ml) was added for additional 18 h. PKR levels were visualized by confocal microscopy using specific antibody to PKR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Co., Santa Cruz, CA) or by Western blotting.Cytosensor Microphysiometer System—Cells were incubated onto capsule cups for use with a Cytosensor (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) overnight at 37 °C in CO2 incubator. The cells were then transferred into the silicon-containing sensor chambers of the Cytosensor and pumped with running buffer comprising low buffered (1 mm phosphate) RPMI medium supplemented with 1% BSA at a flow rate of 100 μl/min and pump cycle was 2 min. The pump cycle consisted of on and off cycles: in the off cycle the fluid flow was periodically halted allowing a build-up of protons (due to acid metabolites as a result of receptor activation) in the chamber; in the on cycle the pump allowed fluid to be resumed and the acid was flushed out of the chamber. This cycle was repeated, and the basal rate of acidification was first measured in the absence of IFN-α. The acidification rate is the output of protons from the cells. The acidification rates due to IFN-α were measured; using a 2-min pump protocol and five repeat cycles, before and after IFN-α treatment to determine the relative changes in acidification rates due to IFN-α. The operation of the apparatus was carried out as recommended by the manufacturer. Data were processed by software supplied by the same manufacturer, and data were exported as an Excel spreadsheet file to GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA) for graphics.Measurement of STAT-1 Tyrosine Phosphorylation—Cells (107) were extracted in a cold lysis buffer, and the lysates were incubated with antibody to STAT-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal serum. Immunoprecipitates were collected, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were washed and blocked with 4% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody to phosphotyrosine (1 μg/ml, Zymed Laboratories) was incubated with the membranes at 4 °C for 18 h followed by incubation for 2 h with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody.Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were formaldehyde-fixed and incubated with primary antibody to PKR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1/50 dilution) for 16 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed three times to remove unbound antibodies. Fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibody (1/100 dilution, 1 h at 37 °C) was subsequently used. Cells were then washed three times in PBS, and the immunofluorescence associated with the cells was imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica-Kaki, Saudi Arabia).RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH), and 15 μg was electrophoresed through a 1.2% agarose/2.2 m formaldehyde gel. Transfer of RNA was performed overnight using Zeta Probe nylon membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Membranes were baked for 2 h in a vacuum oven at 80 °C and prehybridized in Express Hyb solution (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) in a Hybaid hybridization oven at 68 °C (Labnet, Woodbridge, NJ). cDNA probes specific for PKR mRNA were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) using a nick translation kit (Invitrogen). A 40-mer hybridization oligonucleotide probe (Clontech) specific for β-actin mRNA was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The blots were exposed to x-ray film, and the autoradiograms were subsequently developed. RNA signals were measured with a densitometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and quantitated by ImageMaster image analysis software (Amersham Biosciences).Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—RNase L+/+ and RNase L-/- MEFs were treated with IFN-α (BDBB), 1000 units/ml for 4 h. Cells were then treated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D for different periods of time. Cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Five μg of total RNA was used to prepare cDNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Relative levels of PKR mRNA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA were determined using quantitative PCR (Taqman assay) in an ABI Prism 7700 thermal cycler. PCR was performed for 40 cycles according to the manufacturer's protocol. Data analysis was done using Sequence detector version 1.7 software. Results were expressed as -fold difference compared with untreated samples. A rodent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase detection kit was obtained from PE Biosystems. PKR forward and reverse primers were prepared at Invitrogen. PKR probe dual-labeled with TAMRA and FAM was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Primers and probes were selected using the Primer Express 1.0 software from ABI, Inc. The PKR forward primer sequence is 5′-GTT AAA GAG CCC GCC GAA A-3′, and the reverse primer sequence is 5′-CTG CTG GAA AAG CCA CTG AAT-3′, whereas the Taqman PKR probe is 5′-CTG CCG GAA CAT CCT CTA GCG TTG TC-3′.Statistics, Image Analysis, and mRNA Decay Analysis—For comparison between two groups (columns on figures) the Student's paired t test was used. For comparisons among three groups of data (columns on figures), one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. Whereas, in evaluating two groups of data in consideration of other factors (e.g. in response to different doses of IFN), two-way ANOVA was used. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used for paired experiments. A paired Student's t test for comparison between two sets of paired data was performed. Two-tailed probabilities were reported. Densitometry, band detection, background subtraction, and normalization of images was performed using ImageMaster Software (Amersham Biosciences). The one-phase exponential decay curve analysis (GraphPad Prism) was used to assess mRNA decay kinetics. The equation, y = SPAN × exK × PLATEAU, describes the kinetics of mRNA decay. x is time, and y may be a concentration, binding, or response. y begins equal to SPAN + PLATEAU and decreases to PLATEAU with a rate constant K. The half-life of the decay is 0.6932/K. SPAN and PLATEAU are expressed in the same units as the y axis. K is expressed in the inverse of the units used by the x axis.RESULTSPKR Activity in the Presence and Absence of RNase L—During the course of experiments aimed at studying the role of RNase L in controlling protein synthesis during acute viral infections, regulation of PKR was monitored in RNase L+/+ and RNase L-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines by different methods. Initially, PKR assays were performed with poly(I)·poly(C) as activator and endogenous eIF2α as substrate in extracts of cells treated with IFN-α (1000 units/ml) for different periods of time. Phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF2 was determined with a specific antibody. In wild type cells, PKR induction showed transient kinetics following IFN treatment, increasing 4-fold by 6 h and returning to baseline levels by 12 h (Fig. 1A). In contrast, in the RNase L-/- cells, PKR appeared with extended kinetics, remaining elevated at 36 h post-IFN addition. There were no changes in levels of total eIF2α in either cell type during IFN treatment (Fig. 1A, middle panel).To confirm these findings, endogenous levels of eIF2α phosphorylation were determined in intact cells following EMCV infections. The levels of phosphorylated eIF2α were transiently increased in RNase L+/+ cells following IFN treatment and infection with EMCV (Fig. 1B). In contrast, levels of phosphorylated eIF2α in infected RNase L-null cells peaked about 2-fold higher when compared with wild type cells (Fig. 1). In addition, after EMCV infections, phosphorylated eIF2α levels decreased rapidly in wild type cells while remaining elevated in RNase L-/- cells (Fig. 1, A and B).To rule out indirect effects on eIF2α phosphorylation levels possibly mediated by phosphatases, we immunopurified PKR and measured its kinase activity using [γ-32P]ATP. There was significantly increased PKR activity as determined by auto-phosphorylation in extracts of IFN-treated RNase L-null cells when compared with similarly treated wild type cells (Fig. 1C). Therefore, PKR activity as measured by these three approaches was found to be IFN induced to higher levels and for longer periods of time in the absence of RNase L.Biological Consequences of RNase L Regulation of PKR on Viral Protein Synthesis—We chose encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), RNA viruses that are sensitive to IFN-α, to determine the biological consequences of RNase L regulation of PKR (16Khabar K.S.

Profiles of viral and cellular protein synthesis were determined by pulse labeling 1.5 h with [35S]cysteine/methionine in the presence of actinomycin D to suppress host but not viral transcription (14Lewis J.A.

IFN treatment inhibited viral protein while restoring synthesis of cellular proteins due to suppression of virus-induced shut-off of host cell protein synthesis (14Lewis J.A. Clemens M.J. Morris A.J.

At high multiplicities of infection (m.o.i. = 10 or 100), the viruses effectively shut-off cellular protein synthesis (Fig. 2, A–C; compare lanes 2 to 1 and lanes 5 to 4). As a result of IFN treatment, there was partial anti-viral activity in wild type cells but not enough to completely relieve virus-induced blockage of cellular protein synthesis (Fig. 2, A–C, lane 3). IFN-α alone had no significant effect on cellular protein synthesis in either cell type (data not shown). Remarkably, the inhibition of EMCV protein synthesis (m.o.i. of 10) was more potent in RNase L-/- than in RNase L+/+ cells (Fig. 2, A and B), and the IFN was able to both inhibit viral protein synthesis and significantly restore cellular protein synthesis (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 6). The effect was even more apparent at the higher m.o.i. of 100 (Fig. 2B). Similar findings were observed with VSV, viral shut-off of host translation was prevented by IFN treatment of RNase L-null cells but not of wild type cells (Fig. 2C). The antiviral activity of IFN-α in wild type and RNase L-/- cells was determined in viral yield reduction plaque assays on indicator cells. Confluent cells were pretreated with different amounts of IFN-α (10–1000 units/ml) and subsequently infected at an m.o.i. of 10. At this high m.o.i., the anti-EMCV and VSV action of IFN-α was actually superior (p < 0.005, ANOVA) in RNase L-/- MEFs compared with wild type MEFs (Fig. 2, D and E). For example, at a dose of 1000 units/ml of IFN-α, there was 100-fold inhibition in infectious EMCV yield from RNase L-/- MEFs compared with only 8-fold inhibition in EMCV yield (p < 0.0001, Student's paired t test) from wild type cells (Fig. 2D). The enhanced action against viral protein biosynthesis was conditional on the IFN response, because in the absence of IFN, virus yield was higher from RNase L-null cells when compared with wild type cells (Fig. 2F). There was 40- to 50-fold greater virus yield (p < 0.001, Student's paired t test) in RNase L-/- MEFs when compared with wild type MEFs.Fig. 2Inhibition of viral protein biosynthesis.RNase L+/+ MEFs and RNase L-/- MEFs were treated with mock (cell control; CC), virus (V), or IFN (1000 units/ml) for 20 h followed by virus (IFN+V). Viruses are EMCV at m.o.i. of 10 (A), EMCV at m.o.i. of 100 (B), and VSV at m.o.i. = 10 (C). Protein synthesis in the presence of actinomycin D, which inhibits cellular but not viral RNA synthesis, was monitored as described under “Experimental Procedures”; equal amounts of lysates were loaded onto SDS-PAGE. MW, molecular mass standards (220, 97.4, 66, 46, 30, 21.5, and 14.3 kDa). Representative autoradiograms from three experiments are shown. Arrows indicate positions of viral proteins. RNase L+/+ MEFs (black columns) and RNase L-/- MEFs (hatched columns) were first treated with IFN-α (1000 units/ml, 20 h) except control and infected with EMCV (D) or VSV (E). Infectious virus yields were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are the average ± S.E. of three independent experiments and represented as percentage of control (untreated cells, 100%).

IFN induction of PKR was increased with extended kinetics (up to 48 h) in the RNase L-null cells compared with IFN-treated wild type cells (Fig. 3A). The PKR protein levels peaked much later than PKR activity (Fig. 1A) suggesting an additional level of regulation (20Hovanessian A.G. Galabru J. Meurs E. Buffet-Janvresse C. Svab J. Robert N. Virology. 1987; 159: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The increased PKR protein levels due to absence of RNase L were further confirmed with confocal microscopy showing increased immunostaining of IFN-induced levels of PKR protein in RNase L-/- cells when compared with wild type cells ("

Under low copper availability, Cuf1 induces expression of the copper transporter genes. In contrast, sufficient levels of copper inactivate Cuf1 and expression of its target genes. Our study reveals that Cuf1 harbors a putative copper-binding motif, Cys-X-Cys-X3-Cys-X-Cys-X2-Cys-X2-His, within its carboxyl-terminal region to sense changing environmental copper levels. Binding studies reveal that the amino-terminal 174-residue segment of Cuf1 expressed as a fusion protein inEscherichia coli specifically interacts with thecis-acting copper transporter promoter element CuSE (copper-signaling element). Within this region, the first 61 amino acids of Cuf1 exhibit more overall homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ace1 copper-detoxifying factor (from residues 1 to 63) than to Mac1, its functional ortholog. Consistently, we demonstrate that a chimeric Cuf1 protein bearing the amino-terminal 63-residue segment of Ace1 complements cuf1Δ null phenotypes. Furthermore, we show that Schizosaccharomyces pombe cuf1Δ mutant cells expressing the full-length S. cerevisiae Ace1 protein are hypersensitive to copper ions, with a concomitant up-regulation of CuSE-mediated gene expression in fission yeast. Taken together, these studies reveal that S. cerevisiae Ace1 1–63 is functionally exchangeable with S. pombe Cuf1 1–61, and the nature of the amino acids located downstream of this amino-terminal conserved region may be crucial in dictating the type of regulatory response required to establish and maintain copper homeostasis.

Copper is an essential element for aerobic life (1Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The essentiality of copper stems from its ability to undergo electronic changes, making it a redox-active metal that can serve as an electron transfer intermediate for catalytic enzyme activity (2Van Ho A. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 237-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A variety of enzymes that are crucial for metabolism require copper as a redox co-factor, including cytochrome c oxidase, copper, zinc-SOD1, 1The abbreviations used are: SODsuperoxide dismutaseBCSbathocuproinedisulfonic acidCtrcopper transporterCuf1copper factor 1CuSEcopper-signaling elementMTmetallothioneinORFopen reading framePCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenMREmetal regulatory elementCuREcopper-responsive elementsMBPmaltose-binding proteinWTwild type1The abbreviations used are: SODsuperoxide dismutaseBCSbathocuproinedisulfonic acidCtrcopper transporterCuf1copper factor 1CuSEcopper-signaling elementMTmetallothioneinORFopen reading framePCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenMREmetal regulatory elementCuREcopper-responsive elementsMBPmaltose-binding proteinWTwild type and multicopper oxidases (3Peña M.M.O.

The first subdomain (residues 1–40) (called the Zn2+ module) of the DNA binding domain of Ace1 is required for proper interaction between the transcription factor and the AT-rich minor groove of the MREs (14Turner R.B.

This enables the cupro-Ace1 protein to interact with the MREs in a copper-dependent manner allowing rapid activation of target gene expression via its carboxyl-terminal activation domain, which is negatively charged (24Hu S.

The Candida glabrata ACE1 gene ortholog, named AMT1, binds MREs with similar motifs and is essential to mount a protective response to copper toxicity (25Zhou P. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Under low copper conditions, transcription of CTR1, CTR3, and FRE1/7 is induced, whereas under copper replete conditions, expression of these genes is inactivated (31Martins L.J. Jensen L.T.

Studies have identified the nuclear transcription factor Mac1 as an essential component of the transport copper-signaling pathway (36Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

The Mac1 amino-terminal 159 residues constitute the minimal DNA binding domain of the protein (40Jensen L.T. Posewitz M.C. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol.

Within this domain, the first 40 residues of Mac1 exhibit a strong homology to the Zn2+ module found in the Ace1 copper-detoxifying transcription factor that activatesMT gene expression but very little homology outside of this region. The carboxyl-terminal region of Mac1 harbors two Cys-rich repeats, denoted C1 (also identified as REP-I) and C2 (also identified as REP-II) (38Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Lee J. Romeo A. Hassett R.

The C1 motif, Cys264-X-Cys266-X4-Cys271-X-Cys273-X2-Cys276-X2-His279, is essential for copper-sensing, because substitutions created in either all or individual conserved Cys and His residues resulted in elevated and unregulated expression of the copper transport genes. Moreover, it has been shown that the C1 motif can coordinate directly with Cu+ ions (44Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although the C2 motif, Cys322-X-Cys324-X4-Cys329-X-Cys331-X2-Cys334-X2-His337, can interact with four Cu+ atoms, its partial or complete disruption alters the ability of Mac1 to trans-activate target gene expression, rather than its ability to sense copper (42Zhu Z.

Under conditions of copper deprivation, Mac1 is bound to CuREs, whereas in the presence of copper Mac1 is released from its binding sites in vivo (36Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, it has been proposed that the noncopper-bound form of Mac1 binds to DNA to trans-activates copper transporter gene expression, whereas metallation of Mac1 induces intramolecular conformational changes that inactivate the Mac1 DNA binding activity and consequently its trans-activation function (44Jensen L.T. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5400-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, two genes,ctr4+ and ctr5+, encode components that are required for high affinity copper uptake (48Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 49Zhou H. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20529-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The Ctr4-Ctr5 copper transport system consists of two structurally related transmembrane proteins that are physically associated and functions as a heterodimer (49Zhou H. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20529-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This is supported by the observation that, in the absence of Ctr5, Ctr4 fails to localize to the cell surface. Conversely, in the absence of Ctr4, Ctr5 does not localize to the cell surface (49Zhou H. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20529-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Co-expression of the S. pombe Ctr4 and Ctr5 in S. cerevisiae restores high affinity copper transport to an S. cerevisiae ctr1Δctr3Δ strain (49Zhou H. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20529-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This suggests that both Ctr4 and Ctr5 are necessary and sufficient to reconstitute the S. pombe copper transport complex and direct their localization to the plasma membrane. Recent studies have allowed us to identify a third copper transporter from S. pombe, named Ctr6, which localizes to the vacuolar membrane (50Bellemare D.R. Shaner L. Morano K.A. Beaudoin J. Langlois R. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46676-46686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Deletion of thectr6+ gene results in a significant reduction of copper, zinc-SOD1 activity, suggesting a role for S. pombeCtr6 in delivering copper to one or more cytosolic copper-dependent enzymes under conditions of copper starvation (50Bellemare D.R. Shaner L. Morano K.A. Beaudoin J. Langlois R. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46676-46686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Like the ctr4+ andctr5+ genes, which encode the high affinity heteromeric copper transport complex at the cell surface,ctr6+ is activated at the transcriptional level in response to copper limitation by the Cuf1 nutritional copper-sensing transcription factor through the Cu-signalingelement (CuSE) found in the promoters of these genes (48Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,51Beaudoin J. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15472-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The CuSE is defined by the consensus sequence 5′-D(T/A)DDHGCTGD-3′ (D = A, G, or T; H = A, C, or T) (51Beaudoin J. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15472-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). At least a single copy of this cis-acting element is required for activation of gene expression in response to copper limitation (51Beaudoin J. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15472-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The CuSE element bears a strong sequence similarity to the MRE, which is recognized by the Ace1 copper-detoxifying transcription factor from S. cerevisiae. When a consensus MRE from S. cerevisiae is introduced into S. pombe, transcription is induced by copper deprivation in a Cuf1-dependent manner. Furthermore, when expressed in S. cerevisiae ace1Δ cells under conditions of copper scarcity, the Cuf1 protein directs high basal level expression of CUP1 mRNA through the MREs (51Beaudoin J. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15472-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This activation is opposite to what is seen in S. cerevisiaewild type (ACE1) cells. This observation suggests that Cuf1 resembles two distinct types of copper metalloregulatory transcription factors, sharing similar DNA sequence binding specificity as the Ace1 protein, which regulates the expression of the copper detoxification genes, while playing an essential role in coordinating the transcriptional regulation of copper transporter gene expression inS. pombe as the Mac1 protein in S. cerevisiae. In this report, we mapped the functional domains of Cuf1. We determined that the Cys328-X-Cys330-X3-Cys334-X-Cys336-X2-Cys339-X2-His342motif (designated C-rich) within the carboxyl-terminal region of Cuf1 constitutes the copper-sensing module that serves to inactivate Cuf1 function when cells are grown under copper-replete conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the conserved Cys and His residues are not functionally equivalent with respect to their role in copper-dependent inhibition of Cuf1. The amino-terminal 174 amino acids harbor the DNA binding domain of Cuf1. Within this region, the first 61 amino acids of Cuf1 display a strong sequence identity to Ace1 from residues 1 to 63. Expression of a chimeric Cuf1 protein bearing the first 63 amino acid residues from the amino terminus of Ace1 suppresses the phenotypes associated with the inactivation of thecuf1+ gene. Furthermore, S. pombe cuf1Δ cells expressing the S. cerevisiae ACE1 gene are hypersensitive to copper ions, with a concomitant up-regulation of CuSE-mediated gene expression in fission yeast. The S. pombe strains used in this study were the wild type FY435 (h+ his7–366 leu1–32 ura4-Δ18 ade6-M210) (52Bezanilla M. Forsburg S.L. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol.

To ascertain that the results observed were not specific to the S. pombe strain FY435, identical experiments were carried out with the strain FY254 (h−can1–1 leu1–32 ade6-M210 ura4-D18) (kind gift of Susan Forsburg, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA).

Under respiratory growth conditions, yeast cells were grown in a modified yeast extract medium plus supplements in which 2% dextrose was replaced with 3% glycerol. Copper deprivation or copper repletion was carried out by adding the indicated amount of BCS or CuSO4 to cells grown to mid-logarithmic phase (A600 nm of ∼1.0) in Edinburgh minimal medium. After treatments at 30 °C for 1 h, 20-ml samples were withdrawn from the cultures for subsequent steady-state mRNA or protein analyses (51Beaudoin J. Labbé S. J. Biol.

Once generated, each cuf1 mutant allele was isolated from pBluescript SK+ using SmaI and BamHI and swapped for an identical DNA region into the pSPcuf1+S-B/4.2 plasmid (48Labbé S. Peña M.M.O.

To create the cuf1 mutant allele M7, a linker containing anXbaI site was inserted in-frame within thecuf1+ gene at position +369 relative to the first nucleotide of the initiator codon. Using pSPcuf1+S-B/4.2, the linker was introduced by the overlap extension method as described by Ho et al. (54Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

The insertion converted the methionine and proline residues at position 123 and 124 to serine and arginine, creating pSPcuf1+XbaI123. This latter allele was judged to be functional because of its ability to fully complement the cuf1Δ growth defect in glycerol. Subsequently, a 380-bp PstI-XbaI fragment of thecuf1+ gene up to +372 from the start codon (residues 1–124) was isolated by PCR from pSPcuf1+S-B/4.2.

Furthermore, a disordered region near the ATP-binding pocket in the MutS B subunit became traceable, whereas the equivalent region in the A subunit that interacts with the mismatched nucleotide remained disordered. Finally, the DNA binding domains of MutS together with the mismatched DNA were shifted upon binding of ABF.

MutS protein displays both mismatch DNA binding and ATPase activities that are essential for its function.

During DNA replication, interactions between MMR components result in the removal of DNA mismatches via excision and resynthesis steps that occur on the newly replicated DNA strand. ATP binding and hydrolysis by both MutS and MutL appear to be essential for the mismatch recognition and for the formation of a MutS·MutL complex that recruits and activates MutH-directed incision of the newly replicated DNA strand. Homologs of MutS and MutL have been identified in lower and higher eukaryotes; MutH homologs, however, have not been found (reviewed in Refs. 8Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for example, contains six MutS (MSH) and four MutL (MLH) homolog proteins.

Three major models have been developed to explain how MMR factors initiate and execute DNA excision steps that can occur up to several kilobases away from a recognized mismatch. Each of these models incorporates a role for ATP binding and hydrolysis by the MSH and MLH proteins. In the first model, binding of MSH proteins to a mismatch substrate induces an ATP-dependent conformational change that allows recruitment of the MLH proteins. The resulting MSH·MLH complex uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to translocate along DNA to encounter downstream repair factors such as endonucleases, exonucleases, and helicases (20Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 21Blackwell L.J. Bjornson K.P. Modrich P J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32049-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In a second model, ATP acts as a molecular switch analogous to G-proteins (22Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 23Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3922-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the absence of DNA the MSH proteins are bound to ADP. Mismatch binding provokes ADP ⇒ ATP exchange, which allows MSH proteins to form an ATP hydrolysis-independent sliding clamp that slides along DNA to encounter downstream MMR components. The MLH proteins are thought to regulate the MSH proteins by modulating hydrolysis and/or ADP ⇒ ATP exchange activities (22Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Finally, the MutS ATPase activity has been hypothesized to play a proofreading role in MMR by both verifying mismatch recognition and authorizing repair (24Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This model hypothesizes that MSH proteins have to simultaneously bind ATP and the mismatched DNA to recruit MutL and initiate repair, thus enhancing the specificity of mismatch recognition and avoiding mismatch-independent initiation of repair. In this model, the MSH proteins activate downstream repair functions while remaining bound to the mismatch site. Crystal structure analysis of both the Taq and E. coli MutS·DNA complexes suggested that mismatch recognition occurs through an induced-fit mechanism between functionally asymmetric DNA binding domains in the MutS homodimer and kinked mismatched DNA (25Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 26Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Regions were also identified in MutS that could serve as transmitters between the ATP binding and mismatch recognition domains. Although MutS· DNA·ATP complexes have been refractory to x-ray crystallography analysis, both Taq MutS·DNA·ADP andE. coli MutS· DNA·ADP complexes have been solved. In the Taq MutS·DNA structure, ADP was localized to both ATP-binding sites; in E. coli MutS only the A subunit, which directly interacts with the mispaired base, bound ADP. Conformational differences between the Taq MutS·DNA and MutS·DNA·ADP structures have provided a model to explain how ATP might influence mismatch binding by MutS, even though the two binding sites are separated by ∼70 Å (24Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The small changes in the ATP-binding site that resulted from ADP binding appeared to be amplified by a long lever arm that links the ATP and DNA binding domains, resulting in a rotation of the two protein subunits toward each other and a pronounced increase in the mobility of domain IV in subunit B that stabilizes the mispaired base in the major groove. The Taq and E. coli MutS·DNA structures both contain a disordered six amino acid region in each subunit (629–634, SDDLAG, in Taq MutS). The first of the two aspartate residues in this region is highly conserved among MutS homologs. These residues, which map immediately adjacent to a conserved nucleotide-binding N2 motif, remained disordered even in the MutS·DNA structures containing bound ADP (24Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 25Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W.

Mol Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) hypothesized that these residues participate in conformational changes upon ATP binding that are amplified throughout the MutS molecule in a manner analogous to that suggested by analysis of the MutS·DNA·ADP complex. Because the surrounding residues of this disordered loop are in the vicinity of the ATP-binding site, the ordering of these residues may depend on the presence of an intact ATP including the γ-phosphate. Previous mutational studies (24Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) indicated that the MutS-bound ATP is at a high energy state favoring hydrolysis unless a nearby conserved carboxylate (Glu-694 in E. coliMutS) is replaced by alanine. It was also found that the E694A mutant MutS, which fails to hydrolyze ATP, is still able to mediate DNA-dependent activation of MutH. In this study, we searched for ATP analogs that can bind toTaq MutS with the goal of visualizing the disordered loop surrounding the ATP-binding site and elucidating the role of ATP in recruiting downstream mismatch repair components. We report here the inhibition of the ATPase activity of the Taq, E. coli, and S. cerevisiae MutS proteins by ADP·beryllium fluoride (BeFx) (ABF), the crystallographic studies of Taq MutS complexed with mismatched DNA and ABF, and biochemical analyses of the effect of ABF on mismatch recognition by Taq, E. coli, and S. cerevisiaeMutS homolog proteins. Taq MutS proteins, the large fragment of 1–768 amino acids and full-length, and E. coli MutS and MutL were overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described (2Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 24Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W.

Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). MSH2·MSH6 and MLH1·PMS1 were overexpressed and purified as described in Alani (27Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and Hall et al. (28Hall M.C. Kunkel T.A. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 21: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), respectively. Taq MutS ATPase activity was measured in 10–15 μl reactions containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 60–90 mm KCl, and 20–1000 μm[α-32P]ATP. When indicated, a 23-bp mismatch substrate containing an unpaired T (T insertion; 23ΔT; Ref. 25Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) was included at 1 μm, and nucleotide analogs were included as described. Reactions were initiated by MutS addition (0.5–2.0 μmfinal concentration) and were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min.E. coli MutS ATPase activity was measured under similar conditions with the exception that a 35-bp mismatch substrate containing a T:G mismatch (35GT) (5′-CCCTGTGCGACGCTAGCGTGCGGCCTCGTCTGTCC-3′, and the complementary strand except for a G opposite the underlined T) was used, and reactions were incubated at 22 °C for 60 min. MSH2·MSH6 ATPase activity was measured in 10 μl reactions containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm DTT, 100–160 mm NaCl, and 20–100 μm [α-32P]ATP. When specified, a 37-bp mismatch substrate containing a single A insertion (37-+1, Ref. 27Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) was included at 1 μm, and ADP and ADP·BeFx was included at 80 and 250 μm. The reactions were initiated by addition of MSH2·MSH6 (0.1–0.4 μm final concentration) and were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. ATP hydrolysis reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA, pH 8.0, to 25 mm, and the extent of ATP hydrolysis was determined using polyethyleneimine cellulose F (Merck) thin layer chromatography (2Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) followed by phosphorimaging quantification (Molecular Dynamics). Sodium fluoride, aluminum chloride, and beryllium chloride were purchased from Fluka. Sodium tungstate was obtained from ICN. Orthovanadate (Sigma) solution was prepared according to the Salmon laboratory web site (www.bio.unc.edu/faculty/salmon/lab/salmonprotocol.html). Throughout this paper X μm ADP·BeFx (where “X” refers to any concentration) consists of X μmADP, X μm BeCl2, and 5× μmNaF. NaF (0.8 m, stored at −70 °C) and BeCl2 (0.2 m, stored at 4 °C) stock solutions were prepared by dissolving each compound in double-distilled water in plastic tubes. ADP, BeCl2, and NaF were mixed immediately before inclusion in the ATPase assay or crystal soaking experiments (see below). ABF is thought to act as an ATPase inhibitor as follows. In the presence of NaF, the chloride atoms in BeCl2 are thought to be displaced by fluorides to form beryllofluoride (BeFx) with BeF3−·H20 the predominating species in aqueous solution (29Petsko G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). BeFx is thought to inhibit the ATPase activity of some ATPases by tightly binding in conjunction with ADP to the active site. The active site acts as a template to facilitate coordinate covalent bonding between ADP and BeFx (29Petsko G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Binding of Taq MutS to mismatched DNA was performed for 5 min at room temperature in a reaction containing 0.2 μm MutS, 1 nm [32P]110ΔT substrate (containing a single T insertion in the middle of the substrate, Ref. 30Schofield M.J. Nayak S. Scott T.H. Du C. Hsieh P. J. Biol.

At t = 0, a 37-bp T bulge substrate (30Schofield M.J. Nayak S. Scott T.H. Du C. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28291-28299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) was added at 2 μm in combination with either no nucleotide or 80 μm ADP, ATP, or ABF. At t = 15, 30 45, 60, and 75 s, aliquots were removed and electrophoresed in a 5% native polyacrylamide gel as described by Schofield et al.(30Schofield M.J. Nayak S. Scott T.H. Du C. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28291-28299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were dried and quantified on a Fuji BAS-1500 phosphorimager. The dissociation of E. coliMutS·DNA complexes was assayed as follows. 50 nm MutS dimer was preincubated with 2 nm [32P]110ΔT in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 5% sucrose for 5 min at room temperature. At t = 0, 100 nm unlabelled 110ΔT and 100 μm ATP, ADP, or ABF were added. At t = 15 and 300 s, aliquots were removed and electrophoresed in a 4% Tris-glycine gel containing 5 mm MgCl2. Taq MutS (1–768 amino acids) was co-crystallized with the 23ΔT substrate in buffer C (25% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm cacodylate, pH 5.9, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 10 mmMgSO4, 1 mm DTT, 3% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol) as described previously (25Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA binary complex crystals were then soaked for 1 h in buffer C containing 1 mm ADP and then transferred into buffer C containing 1 mm ADP, 2 mmBeCl2, and 10 mm NaF (buffer D) for 24 h to form the ternary complex of MutS·DNA·ABF. Co-crystals were then successively soaked in buffer D containing 5% and then 10% ethylene glycol prior to cryopreservation. Attempts to co-crystallize all three components using ∼500 screening conditions yielded only very small crystals unsuitable for x-ray diffraction. The ABF-soaked MutS·DNA co-crystals diffracted X-rays to 3.1–2.7 Å resolutions (see Table I). Several data sets were collected in-house using a phosphorimaging plate mounted on a Rigaku RU200 x-ray generator. Data were processed using HKL (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38567) Google Scholar), and molecular replacement was successfully carried out using the MutS·DNA·ADP structure as a search model by CNS (32Brunger A.T.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16966) Google Scholar). The crystal diffracting to 3.1 Å resolution showed the most complete electron density map for ADP·BeF3− and was chosen for further refinement. The final refined model contains two Taq MutS subunits, both of which contain 1–765 amino acids, one DNA duplex (23ΔT), two ADP·BeF3− with full occupancy, two structural SO4 ions, and 99 water molecules. The R and R free were refined to 20.9 and 25.9% using CNS (32Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

ATP (400 μm), ADP (400 μm), and ABF (400 μm) were included as indicated. Following a 4 min incubation at 30 °C 0.5 μm cold 37-+1 substrate (27Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) was added for 2 min at room temperature followed by addition of DNase I (Stratagene) at 0.02 units/μl. The DNase I reaction was quenched after a 2 min incubation at room temperature by the addition of 100 μl of stop solution (85% ethanol, 1.5 m ammonium acetate, 20 μg/ml yeast tRNA). Samples were allowed to precipitate on dry ice for at least 30 min, then spun for 25 min at 15,000 rpm washing once with 75% ethanol. Dried samples were resuspended in 4 μl 90% formamide, 50 mm EDTA and denatured at 92 °C for 2 min and snap cooled on ice. Samples were run at 75 watts on a denaturing 12% PAGE for one hour. Gels were dried and visualized using a phosphorimaging system and the Imagequant program (Molecular Dynamics). The formation of a ternary complex containing MSH2·MSH6, MLH1·PMS1, mismatched DNA, and ATP, ADP, or ABF was examined in gel shift assays. 15 μl reactions were set up on ice in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 μg/ml AcBSA, 8% sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 25 mmNaCl. 32P-labeled mismatched duplex DNA (+1 48-mer, Ref.33Bowers J. Tran P.T. Liskay R.M. Alani E. J. Mol.

Following MSH2·MSH6 (133 nm) and MLH1·PMS1 (82 nm) addition, binding reactions were incubated at room temperature for 8 min. Samples were then electrophoresed at 130 V for 50 min at room temperature in 4% (w/v) native polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5× Tris borate EDTA buffer. Gels were dried and then visualized using a phosphorimaging system and analyzed using Imagequant (Molecular Dynamics). Attempts to obtain the crystal structures of Taq MutS in an ATP-bound state using non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs, such as ATPγS or AMPNP, have been unsuccessful. Only MutS·ADP complexes were identified, suggesting that the ATP-bound state of MutS was unstable (24Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We therefore searched for ATP analogs that can strongly inhibit the TaqMutS ATPase activity as an indication that it competes well for the ATP-binding site and with the goal of capturing Taq MutS bound with both mismatch DNA and an ATP analog. Biochemical and structural studies have suggested that in the presence of ADP, phosphate analogs such as orthovanadate, tungstate, and aluminum tetrafluoride mimic the metastable ADP·Pi transition state that occurs after hydrolysis, whereas ADP·beryllium fluoride mimics ATP (29Petsko G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I.

Consistent with this idea was the observation that the E. coliMutL·ADP·BeF3− complex displayed a conformation as measured in x-ray crystallographic analysis that was indistinguishable from the MutL·AMPPNP complex. 2J. Hu and W. Yang, unpublished data. To test whether phosphate analogs could be used to identify a MutS·ATP-like complex, we performed ATPase assays on TaqMutS incubated with [α-32P]ATP in the presence of ATP analogs. As shown in Fig. 1 A, ABF most strongly inhibited the Taq MutS ATPase, with tungstate displaying no inhibition and vanadate and aluminum fluoride showing only weak inhibition. The inhibition by ABF was concentration-dependent, and under conditions where ATP and ABF concentrations were identical, the Taq MutS ATPase activity was reduced to ∼5% of the uninhibited activity (Fig.1 B). Similar inhibition profiles were observed for both theE. coli MutS (Fig. 1 C) and S. cerevisiae MSH2·MSH6 ATPases (Fig. 1 D), suggesting a conserved mechanism of inhibition. It is important to note that the inhibition of the E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MutS ATPase activities by ortho- and decavanadate was recently reported by Pezza et al. (36Pezza R.J. Villarreal M.A. Montich G.G. Argarana C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4700-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Previous studies with human MSH2·MSH6 (22Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and E. coliMutS proteins (37Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) suggested that the rate-limiting step in MSH protein ATP hydrolysis is altered by mismatch DNA. Gradia et al.(22Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) utilized ADP exchange and single turnover γ-phosphate hydrolysis analyses to show that in the absence of DNA, ADP ⇒ ATP exchange by the human MSH2·MSH6 ATPase was rate-limiting. However, in the presence of mismatch DNA, nucleotide exchange was dramatically increased. Consistent with this observation, Bjornson et al.(37Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), using pre-steady state chemical quench analysis, found that in the absence of DNA the rate-limiting step of the E. colireaction was after hydrolysis, indicating that under saturating conditions MutS is predominantly in an ADP-bound form. In the presence of DNA, however, the rate-limiting step shifted to either prior or during hydrolysis. Together, these studies suggest that the presence of mismatch DNA shifts the rate-limiting step from ADP (product) release to ATP binding or hydrolysis (product formation). If ABF inhibits the MSH ATPases by inhibiting nucleotide exchange, then inhibition by this analog might be reduced in the presence of mismatch DNA because nucleotide exchange would no longer be rate-limiting. The effect of ABF on the ATPase activity of E. coli MutS (Fig. 1 C) and S. cerevisiae MSH2·MSH6 (Fig. 1 E) was significantly reduced, but not eliminated, in the presence of mismatch DNA. For MSH2·MSH6, the presence of homoduplex DNA, which stimulated ATPase activity to a lesser extent than mismatch DNA, also reduced the inhibition by ABF. The reduction in inhibition, however, was less than was observed with mismatch DNA (data not"

This can be achieved by either down-regulation of transcription of antigen presentation genes or posttranslational inactivation of proteins involved in antigen presentation. In this study, a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-deficient melanoma cell line, SK-MEL-19, was found deficient in the expression of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)-1 mRNA even after IFN-γ stimulation, despite its active transcription of the TAP-1gene. This abnormality was caused by a single-nucleotide deletion at position +1489 of the TAP-1 gene and was corrected by cycloheximide, which inhibits RNA degradation. Using an inducible Tet-Off system, we demonstrated that deletion of the nucleotide resulted in a >2-fold decrease in the half-life of TAP-1mRNA. However, the decrease of the half-life of TAP-1mRNA is not mediated by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay because deletions of two additional nucleotides in the region, which corrected the nonsense mutation, did not restore TAP-1 mRNA stability. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that the degradation of mRNA of an antigen presentation gene is involved in HLA class I down-regulation in malignant cells.

In fact, a high proportion of malignant tumors, including melanoma, have severely depressed cell surface expression of class I HLA antigens (7Seliger B. Ritz U. Abele R. Bock M. Tampe R. Sutter G. Drexler I. Huber C. Ferrone S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8647-8650PubMed Google Scholar), the target molecules that present tumor antigenic peptide to cytolytic T lymphocytes. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the T-cell malfunction or antigen presentation defects may thus provide insight for immunotherapy of melanoma and other cancers. Optimal cell surface expression of HLA molecules requires the coordinated expression of several genes, such as transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP)1-1/2, low molecular weight peptide (LMP)-2/7, and tapasin, as well as HLA class I heavy chain and β2-microglobulin (β2M). In cases of both tumorigenesis and viral infection, expression of these genes and the function of the encoded proteins are often impaired (8Rotem-Yehudar R. Shechter H. Ehrlich R. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 144: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 9Rotem-Yehudar R. Groettrup M. Soza A. Kloetzel P.M. Ehrlich R. J. Exp.

Theoretically, gene expression can be modulated by transcriptional, posttranscriptional, translational, and posttranslational mechanisms. The mechanisms that have been shown to underlie the antigen presentation abnormalities are transcriptional suppression of antigen presentation genes and/or functional inactivation of their gene products, either by missense mutation or by protein-protein interactions (11Ahn K.

Here we show that actively transcribedTAP-1 mRNA in the melanoma cell line SK-MEL-19 is rapidly degraded even after stimulation with IFN-γ. Cloning and sequencing analysis have revealed a single-nucleotide deletion at position +1489. This mutation results in substantial reduction of the stability of TAP-1 mRNA by mechanisms unrelated to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). These results reveal a new potential mechanism for tumor evasion of host T-cell recognition. Human melanoma cell lines 1195, 1102, and SK-MEL-19 were cultured as described previously (15Hicklin D.J. Kageshita T. Ferrone S. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3 was obtained from ATCC (HTB-30; ATCC, Manassas, VA). All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For induction of HLA class I expression, cells were cultured in medium supplemented with recombinant human IFN-γ (1000 units/ml; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). PE-conjugated anti-HLA-A, -B, and -C antibody (clone G46-2.6) and isotype control PE-conjugated mouse IgG1 were purchased from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Cell surface HLA class I expression was examined by flow cytometry as described previously (4Zheng P. Guo Y. Niu Q. Levy D.E. Dyck J.A. Lu S. Sheiman L.A. Liu Y. Nature. 1998; 396: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, viable cells were incubated with PE-conjugated mouse IgG1 and PE-conjugated anti-HLA-A, -B, and -C antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal calf serum, cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and examined by flow cytometry. Cells were either treated with IFN-γ (R&D Systems) at 1000 units/ml for 48 h or left untreated. For cycloheximide (CHX; Sigma) treatment, SK-MEL-19 cells were cultured with IFN-γ at 1000 units/ml for 48 h, and then CHX was added to the cells for a final concentration of either 5 or 10 μg/ml, respectively, for up to 16 h. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Hybridization conditions followed the instructions of the Northern hybridization kit (Eppendorf Scientific, Westbury, NY). The cDNA probes for TAP-1,TAP-2, LMP-2, LMP-7, HLA class I heavy chain, and β2M were made from PCR products using primers listed previously (11Ahn K. Meyer T.H. Uebel S. Sempe P. Djaballah H. Yang Y. Peterson P.A. Fruh K. Tampe R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3247-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). A human splenocyte cDNA library from Invitrogen was used as the template for PCR reactions. All PCR products were subcloned into pBluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced and confirmed to be identical to published sequences. The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the DECAprimeTM II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The human small cell carcinoma H146 cell line (provided by Dr. N. P. Restifo; National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) was incubated with IFN-γ at 1000 units/ml for 48 h. Total RNA was isolated as described above. Reverse transcription was done using the SUPERSCRIPT First-Strand cDNA Synthesis System (Invitrogen). TAP-1 cDNA was amplified by PCR in three fragments. Primers were as follows: hTAP.f1, 5′-GCGGCCGCTTTCGATTTCGCTTTC-3′; hTAP.r1, 5′-TGCAGTAGCCTGGTGCTATCCG-3′; hTAP.f2, 5′-CTTGCCTTGTTCCGAGAGCTGA-3′; hTAP.r2, 5′-CTCGTTGGCAAAGCTTCGAAC-3′; hTAP.f3, 5′-CGGCCATGCCTACAGTTCGAAG-3′; and hTAP.r3, 5′-ATAAATATCAAGAACCTACAGGG-3′. The three fragments were cloned into pBS-KS vector (Stratagene) at NotI/SmaI,SmaI/HindIII, andHindIII/XhoI sites, respectively, and sequenced to confirm that the cDNA has a wild type sequence. When SK-MEL-19 cells grew to 70% confluence, 0.2 μg of pcDNA3.1/Hyg(+) vector (Invitrogen) and pcDNA3.1/Hyg(+) vector with wild typeTAP-1 cDNA insert were respectively transfected into each well of a 24-well plate, using 6 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manual. 48 h later, the transfected cells were replated into 96-well plates and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Single cell clones were selected for further culture and analyzed for HLA class I antigen expression. Genomic DNA was isolated from SK-MEL-19 cells, SK-BR-3 cells, and HeLa cells. Genomic DNA (20 μg) was digested with AflIII (Invitrogen) and separated in 0.8% agarose gel. The TAP-1 promoter probe was made by PCR from normal human lymphocyte genomic DNA with sense primer 5′-TCCCGCCTCGAGCATCCCTGCAAGGCA-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TGCAGTAGCCTGGTGCTATCCG-3′. Probes were labeled as described above. The TAP-1 promoter was amplified from SK-MEL-19 cell genomic DNA by PCR using the following primers: hTAP1.Pr1, 5′-GCTCTAGATGGCACTCGGACGCCGTC-3′; and hLMP2.Pf1, 5′-GCTCTAGACCCTGCAAGGCACCGCTC-3′. The PCR products were subcloned using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen) and then cloned into pGL2-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) at XhoI andHindIII sites. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression level of the firefly luciferase from the pGL2 constructs (basic, SV40, pTAP1/T, and pTAP1/G) was normalized to the internal control pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase level. Results were shown as the fold increase compared with the pGL2-basic. The dual luciferase assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The assay was performed as described elsewhere (16Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei were extracted from 107 to 108 SK-MEL-19 cells treated with or without 1000 units/ml IFN-γ. The transcripts were labeled in vitro with 40 nm biotin-16-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the presence of 3.75 mm ATP, GTP, and CTP; 25 mmTris-HCl; 12.5 mm MgCl2; and 750 mmKCl. cDNA fragments of LMP-2 and GAPDH were amplified by PCR from cloned cDNA constructs (11Ahn K. Meyer T.H. Uebel S. Sempe P. Djaballah H. Yang Y. Peterson P.A. Fruh K. Tampe R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3247-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). TAP-1cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR from cloned cDNA constructs using primers hTAP1.f1 and hTAP1.r1 described above. The pcDNA3.1/Hyg(+) vector was linearized with HindIII. All the DNA was immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane using S&S Minifold II slot blot apparatus according to the manual (Schleicher & Schüll). Hybridization conditions were as described previously (16Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar), and the biotin-labeled transcripts were detected using streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and CDP-star Ready-To-Use with Nitro-Block-II reagent (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Primers hTAP1CE7.f (5′-GCACCCCTCGCTGCCTACCCAGTGGTCT-3′) and hTAP1CE7.r (5′-TACAGGGAGTGGTAGGTTGTACCTG-3′) were used to amplify from the genomic DNA the region of TAP-1 exon 7 where the single-nucleotide deletion resides. The region was also amplified from cDNA using primers hTAP1CE7.f and hTAP1CE7.r PCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis and purified using Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The purified PCR products were incubated withBslI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 55 °C overnight and then separated in 5% agarose gel. Wild type TAP-1 cDNA was cloned from the human small cell carcinoma H146 cell line as described above. TAP-1 D1489 was generated by PCR using the total cDNA from the SK-MEL-19 cells as the template. Site-directed mutagenesis by overlapping PCR was performed to make TAP-1 Del3 cDNA. After confirming their sequences, all three TAP-1 cDNAs were inserted into the multiple cloning site of the pBI-EGFP vector (Clontech) by blunt-end ligation. The three constructs, pBI-EGFP-TAP1, pTet-Off (Clontech), and pcDNA3.1/Hyg(+) (Invitrogen), were co-transfected into SK-MEL-19 cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Stably transfected cell clones were selected in 96-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). To confirm the efficiency of the Tet-Off construct in the tumor cell line, the green fluorescence protein-positive cell clones were treated with 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 24 h. The total RNA was extracted from the cell clones with or without tetracycline treatment. The cell clones in which TAP-1 mRNA expression was inhibited by at least 95% by tetracycline were used for the study of mRNA stability. The TAP-1 cDNA construct used to make the TAP-1 antisense transcript was the same as the one used for the Northern blot. The GAPDHcDNA fragment was generated by PCR using the primers hGAPDH.f (5′-TGAGAACGGGAAGCTTGTCATCAA-3′) and hGAPDH.r (5′-CAGCCTTCTAGATGGTGGTGAAGA-3′). The EGFP cDNA fragment was also generated by PCR using the primers EGFP.f (5′-TCCAGCAGGATCCTGTGATCGCGCT-3′) and EGFP.r (5′-ACCTACGGCCTCGAGTGCTTCAGCC-3′). The antisense probes were made using the Riboprobe in vitro transcription system (Promega). The RNase protection assay was conducted with the RPA III ribonuclease protection assay kit (Ambion) according to the instruction manual. After separation of protected fragments on a 6% sequencing gel, signals were quantified by phosphorimaging (Amersham Biosciences). The TAP-1 signal intensity was normalized by that of the GAPDH signal, which served as a loading control. The percentages of the amount of remainingTAP-1 mRNA at different time points after tetracycline was added compared with time 0 were calculated. Three human melanoma cell lines (1102, 1195, and SK-MEL-19) were examined by flow cytometry for their cell surface HLA class I expression with or without IFN-γ stimulation. A PE-conjugated anti-human HLA-A, -B, and -C antibody was used to detect all HLA class I alleles, and a PE-conjugated mouse IgG1 was used as isotype control. As shown in Fig.1a, 1102 and 1195 cells had significant HLA class I that was further up-regulated by incubation with 1000 units/ml IFN-γ for 3 days. Confirming previous studies (15Hicklin D.J. Kageshita T. Ferrone S. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we found that SK-MEL-19 cells had no cell surface HLA. Surprisingly, whereas other melanoma cell lines up-regulated their cell surface HLA in response to IFN-γ, very little HLA class I antigen could be found on the SK-MEL-19 cells even after IFN-γ-treatment. Because optimal cell surface HLA class I expression requires the coordinated expression of multiple genes, includingTAP-1/2, LMP-2/7, and β2M as well as HLA class I heavy chain, a Northern blot analysis was performed to detect the expression of these genes (Fig.1b). In 1102 and 1195 cells, all six genes were expressed at low but detectable levels. IFN-γ treatment drastically induced expression of all six genes. Interestingly, in the SK-MEL-19 cells, whereas β2M, HLA heavy chain, LMP-2,LMP-7, and TAP-2 were present at low levels without induction, no TAP-1 mRNA was detected. After IFN-γ treatment, β2M, HLA heavy chain,TAP-2, LMP-2, and LMP-7 were expressed at high levels, yet TAP-1 was still expressed at low levels. It has been known that TAP-deficient cells can express HLA class I after transfection with the TAP-1 or TAP-2 gene (17Kallfelz M. Jung D. Hilmes C. Knuth A. Jaeger E. Huber C. Seliger B. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Singal D.P. Ye M. Bienzle D. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 19Spies T. DeMars R. Nature. 1991; 351: 323-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). To test whether the lack of TAP-1 expression was responsible for the barely detectable expression of HLA class I antigen on the surface of SK-MEL-19 cells, we transfected the cells withTAP-1 cDNA. As shown in Fig. 1c, theTAP-1 cDNA-transfected SK-MEL-19 cells expressed significant levels of HLA class I antigen even before IFN-γ-treatment. Moreover, the TAP-1 transfectants were as responsive to IFN-γ as the other melanoma cell lines. Based on these results, it is likely that the primary defect of antigen presentation in SK-MEL-19 cells is attributable to defects in TAP-1expression. Because the TAP-1 expression was low at the mRNA level, we hypothesized that the TAP-1 down-regulation was caused by defective transcription or malfunction in RNA metabolism. TheTAP-1 expression is under the control of a bidirectional promoter, as characterized by Wright et al. (20Wright K.L. White L.C. Kelly A. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Ting J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1459-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We cloned and sequenced the 593-bp TAP-1 promoter from SK-MEL-19 cells. In comparison with the published sequence (20Wright K.L. White L.C. Kelly A. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Ting J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1459-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), a single-nucleotide G → T replacement was identified at position −446 (the first ATG of the TAP-1 gene is designated as +1), which is close to the first transcription start site at −427 (20Wright K.L. White L.C. Kelly A. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Ting J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1459-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2a). Because the T allele results in a loss of restriction site AflIII, we did a Southern blot hybridization using AflIII to confirm the mismatch. As shown in Fig. 2a, whereas the HeLa cell line contained homozygous G alleles as described previously (20Wright K.L. White L.C. Kelly A. Beck S. Trowsdale J. Ting J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1459-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), both SK-MEL-19 and the breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3 were homozygous for T alleles that lack the restriction site for AflIII. To test whether this single-nucleotide replacement results in reduced promoter activity, both alleles of the TAP-1 promoter were cloned into the pGL2-basic vector that contains the luciferase reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 2b, the T allele TAP-1promoter retained 50% of the promoter activity compared with the G allele. However, given the significant variation in transient transfection and luciferase assays, it is unclear whether the G → T change has a significant effect on TAP-1 transcription. However, both promoters were equally efficiently induced by IFN-γ treatment, whereas the TAP-1 mRNA in the original SK-MEL-19 cell line was not induced by IFN-γ treatment (Fig.1b). Moreover, our analysis of normal human peripheral blood lymphocyte samples revealed that both alleles were present at a high frequency, and individuals that carry either G or T alleles have equivalent cell surface HLA class I antigen expression (data not shown). We therefore performed a nuclear run-on assay to directly evaluate the transcription of the TAP-1 gene. LMP-2transcription, which is under the control of the same bidirectional promoter, was also evaluated. As shown in Fig. 2c,TAP-1 was transcribed at high levels in SK-MEL-19 cells under basal conditions, although IFN-γ appeared to up-regulateTAP-1 transcription somewhat. In contrast, LMP-2was transcribed at an undetectable level but was induced to high levels by IFN-γ (Fig. 2c). The lack of LMP-2transcription at basal condition may reflect the IFN-γ-inducible expression pattern of this gene. These results demonstrate that lack ofTAP-1 mRNA in SK-MEL-19 cells was not due to defective transcription. Taken together, the results demonstrate that a posttranscriptional defect is responsible for poor TAP-1expression in SK-MEL-19 cells even after IFN-γ stimulation. Numerous studies have revealed defective TAP-1 expression among tumor cells (7Seliger B. Ritz U. Abele R. Bock M. Tampe R. Sutter G. Drexler I. Huber C. Ferrone S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8647-8650PubMed Google Scholar, 23Liu H.X. Cartegni L. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 55-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, however, this is the first example of a posttranscriptional defect of TAP-1 expression. A major mechanism responsible for posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA is RNA degradation, which can be prevented by CHX, a protein synthesis inhibitor of mammalian cells. It is well established that the turnover of mRNA is closely linked to the translation process and that blocking translation can stabilize mRNA, especially those mRNA with short half-lives (21Lozano F. Maertzdorf B. Pannell R. Milstein C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Liu H.X. Chew S.L. Cartegni L. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 23Liu H.X. Cartegni L. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 55-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether accelerated RNA degradation is responsible for the lack of TAP-1 in SK-MEL-19 cells, we treated the SK-MEL-19 and control HeLa cells with CHX after incubation with or without IFN-γ (1000 units/ml) for 48 h at 37 °C. At different time points after the CHX was added to the cell culture, cells were harvested, and the total cellular RNA was analyzed for TAP-1mRNA. The intensity of each band was quantified using ImageQuant 5.0 software (Amersham Biosciences) after exposure to a phosphorimaging screen (Fig. 3). For a better comparison, TAP-1 mRNA levels were normalized to the endogenous housekeeping gene GAPDH level, and the fold increase compared with non-CHX-treated cells was calculated. Under basal conditions, the TAP-1 mRNA was up-regulated 4.8-fold in SK-MEL-19 cells. After IFN-γ induction, theTAP-1 mRNA was up-regulated 25.7-fold. In comparison, CHX caused a less significant increase of TAP-1 mRNA in both IFN-γ-treated and untreated HeLa cells. Taken together, the lack of TAP-1 mRNA, the normal transcription ofTAP-1, and the rescue of TAP-1 mRNA by CHX treatment suggest that the TAP-1 mRNA was rapidly degraded in the SK-MEL-19 cells. It is noteworthy that in SK-MEL-19 cells, the effect of CHX was significantly stronger when used in combination with IFN-γ. This finding cannot be fully explained by the fact the IFN-γ is a transcriptional activator for antigen presentation genes, because its effect on TAP-1transcription is not so obvious in SK-MEL-19 cells as shown in Fig.2c. It is likely that IFN-γ stabilized mRNA in SK-MEL-19 cells, although this possibility remains to be tested formally. The rapid degradation of TAP-1 mRNA can be due to a genetic lesion in the TAP-1 gene. Alternatively, it is possible that the tumor cell line expresses factors that can causeTAP-1 mRNA degradation. The successful rescue of cell surface HLA class I antigen expression by wild type TAP-1 in SK-MEL-19 cells favors the first hypothesis because a wild type cDNA can be expressed in the tumor cell line. As the first step to test this hypothesis, we cloned TAP-1 cDNA from SK-MEL-19 cells that were treated with both IFN-γ and CHX as described above. All of the three clones sequenced showed a single-nucleotide deletion at position +1489 (Fig.4a), which resides in exon 7 in the TAP-1 gene. Further analysis showed that multiple downstream premature termination codons (the closest one is at position +1555) were present due to this nucleotide deletion (two of them are shown in Fig. 4c). To confirm that the mutation was in theTAP-1 gene, we amplified exon 7 of the TAP-1 gene from the SK-MEL-19 cells by PCR. The PCR products were digested withBslI because this restriction enzyme recognizes the deletion mutant but does not recognize the wild type exon 7. Because complete digestion was obtained, it appears that the SK-MEL-19 cells are homozygous for the frameshift mutation (Fig. 4b), even though the cytogenetic analysis revealed that there are four copies of chromosome 6 present in the SK-MEL-19 cells (data not shown). We subsequently amplified exon 7 of the TAP-1 gene from 50 normal human peripheral lymphocyte genomic DNA samples by PCR and subjected the PCR products to BstI digestion. Because none of the PCR products from the 50 samples could be digested byBslI, it is most likely that the single-nucleotide deletion in SK-MEL-19 cells resulted from a somatic mutation (data not shown) and that the apparent homozygosity of the TAP-1 locus caused aneuploidy. Premature termination codons resulting from frameshift mutation or nonsense mutation have been shown to interfere with the metabolism of many different mRNAs in mammalian cells, leading to nonsense-mediated altered RNA splicing, such as exon skipping and intron retention and/or NMD (21Lozano F. Maertzdorf B. Pannell R. Milstein C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Liu H.X. Chew S.L. Cartegni L. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 23Liu H.X. Cartegni L. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 55-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, a mutation may disrupt a cis-element that is necessary for mRNA stability and thereby cause RNA decay. To differentiate the two possible mechanisms, we designed another TAP-1 mutant (TAP-1 Del3) that has an in-frame 3-nucleotide deletion at the same position as TAP-1 D1489 (Fig. 5a) and compared the mRNA half-lives of TAP-1 WT, TAP-1 D1489, and TAP-1 Del3. If the degradation of TAP-1 D1489 is via the NMD pathway, then the half-life of the TAP-1 Del3 message should be comparable with that of TAP-1 WT. Otherwise, if the message of TAP-1 Del3 is comparable with or even more unstable than that of the TAP-1 D1489, then it is the deletion itself, but not the resulting premature termination codons, that leads to the accelerated decay of TAP-1 mRNA in SK-MEL-19 cells. The Tet-Off gene expression system was adapted (Fig. 5a) to compare the stabilities of various TAP-1 mRNAs. We first selected the SK-MEL-19 transfectants with an induction ratio (Tet 0/Tet 24 h) of 20 or greater to test mRNA half-lives. This ensured that more than 95% of transcription was blocked by the tetracycline after 24 h. The selected cell clones were then treated with 1 μg/ml tetracycline for different lengths of time before the total RNA was harvested. The amounts of the mRNA were quantified by phosphorimaging. In addition, the intensity of the TAP-1signal was normalized to that of GAPDH before the percentage of remaining mRNA was calculated. Four experiments were conducted, and an average percentage value was used to derive the mRNA half-lives (t12) via regression analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, b and c, with at12 of 7.2 h, the TAP-1 WT mRNA is considerably more stable than that of the TAP-1 D1489 (t12 = 3.5 h). However, the mRNA derived from TAP-1 Del3 (t12 = 2.7 h), which has an in-frame 3-nucleotide deletion, was degraded at least as fast as that of TAP-1 D1489. Because the TAP-1 Del3 mRNA has no premature termination codon downstream to the deletion, the accelerated decay in mutant TAP-1 mRNA is most likely through mechanisms other than NMD. It is more likely that the mutation disrupts a cis-element critical for the stability of TAP-1 mRNA. Whereas few cis-elements that help to stabilize mRNA have been reported, at least two have been reported by others (24Mullner E.W. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 25Mullner E.W. Neupert B. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) and our group (26Zhou Q. Guo Y. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Preliminary analysis showed no similarity between the region surrounding the mutation and the previously reported cis-element. Nevertheless, the NMD is a well-conserved cellular surveillance mechanism. Whereas our work revealed a non-NMD mechanism forTAP-1 mRNA degradation, it is still possible that mRNA derived from the endogenous mutant TAP-1 gene can also be degraded by NMD. It has been shown recently that several criteria have to be met for the pathway to degrade a premature termination codon-containing message. First, at least one downstream spliceable intron is required for optimal NMD (27Zhang J. Sun X. Qian Y. LaDuca J.P. Maquat L.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5272-5283Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 28Thermann R. Neu-Yilik G. Deters A. Frede U. Wehr K. Hagemeier C. Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E.

Genet. 2002; 11: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The intron is thought to help recruit NMD factors, such as hUpf3, to the mRNA via the spliceosome (30Lykke-Andersen J. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Cell. 2000; 103: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 31Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Dreyfuss G.

Second, the premature termination codon should be at least 45–55 nucleotides away from the next spliceable intron (27Zhang J. Sun X. Qian Y. LaDuca J.P. Maquat L.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5272-5283Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 28Thermann R. Neu-Yilik G. Deters A. Frede U. Wehr K. Hagemeier C. Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3484-3494Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The lack of introns in our constructs may have prevented us from revealing NMD in TAP-1 mRNA degradation. However, intronless premature termination codon-containing HEXA mRNA was shown to be subject to NMD, although at a lower efficiency than that seen when multiple downstream introns are present (33Rajavel K.S. Neufeld E.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5512-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In preliminary studies, when we made pBI-EGFP/TAP1 constructs with intron 7 or 8, the results also failed to support a role for NMD in degradation of the mutated TAP-1 mRNA (data not shown). Posttranscriptional regulations of other genes involved in antigen presentation have been reported previously (34McCutcheon J.A. Gumperz J. Smith K.D. Lutz C.T. Parham P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2085-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The increased turnover of HLA-C heavy chain mRNA has been suggested to contribute to the low level of HLA-C surface expression (34McCutcheon J.A. Gumperz J. Smith K.D. Lutz C.T. Parham P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2085-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our work shows that mutations in the TAP-1 gene in a tumor cell line can modulate its mRNA stability. This mechanism may be exploited by tumors to evade host immunity. We thank Dr. Jian-Xin Gao for flow cytometry and Jennifer Kiel and Lynde Shaw for secretarial assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1998312671,"Escherichia coli α-hemolysin (HlyA) is a 107-kDa protein toxin with a wide range of mammalian target cells. Previous work has shown that glycophorin is a specific receptor for HlyA in red blood cells (Cortajarena, A. L., Goñi, F. M., and Ostolaza, H. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 12513–12519). The present study was aimed at identifying the glycophorin-binding region in the toxin. Data in the literature pointed to a short amino acid sequence near the C terminus as a putative receptor-binding domain. Previous sequence analyses of several homologous toxins that belong, like HlyA, to the so-called RTX toxin family revealed a conserved region that corresponded to residues 914–936 of HlyA. We therefore prepared a deletion mutant lacking these residues (HlyAΔ914–936) and found that its hemolytic activity was decreased by 10,000-fold with respect to the wild type. This deletion mutant was virtually unable to bind human and horse red blood cells or to bind pure glycophorin in an affinity column. The peptide Trp914–Arg936 had no lytic activity of its own, but it could bind glycophorin reconstituted in lipid vesicles. Moreover, the peptide Trp914–Arg936 protected red blood cells from hemolysis induced by wild type HlyA. It was concluded that amino acid residues 914–936 constitute a major receptor-binding region in α-hemolysin.

It is a member of the so-called “RTX family,” a group of proteins characterized by the presence of a Gly- and Asp-rich nonapeptide sequence repeated in tandem near the protein C terminus (for reviews, see Refs. 1Coote J.G.

These repeats constitute a Ca2+-binding domain whose structure has been solved at high resolution for a non-toxin member of the RTX family, the alkaline protease from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6Baumann U. Wu S. Flaherty K. McKay D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). HlyA first binds a receptor on the cell surface, a β2-integrin in leukocytes (7Lally E.T.

Recent data indicate that insertion may take place in the absence of Ca2+ (9Schindel C. Zitzer A. Schulte B. Gerhards A. Stanley P. Hughes C. Koronakis V. Bhakdi S. Palmer M. Eur. J.

Note that the Ca2+-binding domain is located near the protein C terminus, whereas the membrane insertion domain is located near the N terminus (9Schindel C. Zitzer A. Schulte B. Gerhards A.

Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1013-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The present study is devoted to exploring the early stages of HlyA interaction with the target cell, namely its binding to the surface receptor. In particular, our investigation is aimed at the region(s) of the protein that bind(s) the receptor glycophorin on mammalian erythrocytes (8Cortajarena A.L. Goñi F.M. Ostolaza H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12513-12519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A number of previous studies suggest that a region between the repeat domain and the C terminus may be involved in binding this specific receptor. For example, Bejerano et al. (14Bejerano M. Nisan I. Ludwig A. Goebel W. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have described two amino acid “blocks,” located after the nonapeptide repeats, in the C terminus of the adenylate cyclase toxin (another member of the RTX family). Block A (15 amino acids) is essential for the toxic activity since it is required for the toxin binding and insertion into the membrane. Deletion of block B, however, does not affect the toxin activity. HlyA possesses homologous A and B blocks (Fig. 1), and it has been shown (14Bejerano M. Nisan I. Ludwig A. Goebel W. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that deletion of a region that includes the last two residues of block A, the connection between the blocks, and the first nine amino acids of block B abolishes the hemolytic activity. Previously, Chervaux and Holland (15Chervaux C. Holland I.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) had shown that five point mutations in that region (residues 918, 920, 921, 928, and 932) inhibited hemolysis without affecting protein export. Leukotoxin from Pasteurella hemolytica, also a RTX toxin, can be neutralized by incubation with a specific antibody whose epitope is located in the C-terminal region of leukotoxin between residues 841–872 (16Lainson F.A. Murray J. Davies R.C. Donachie W. Microbiology (Read.). 1996; 142: 2499-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This epitope appears to be related to the binding of the toxin to the β2-integrin receptor in the target cell (17Sun Y. Clinkenbeard K.D. Cudd L. Clarke C. Clinkenbeard P. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6264-6269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the epitope overlaps partially blocks A and B: 841WFREADFAKEVPNYKATKDEK IEEIIGQNGER872. Another RTX toxin, leukotoxin from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, contains an epitope, recognized by neutralizing antibodies, that begins 78 residues after the last repeat and overlaps partially with the sequence given above (18Lally E.T. Golub E.E. Kieba I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31289-31295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, in the adenylate cyclase toxin, deletion of the last 75 residues abolishes both the lytic and cell binding activities (19Iwaki M. Ullmann A. Sebo P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The deleted region contains a sequence homologous to the leukotoxin epitope mentioned above. In view of the above findings, we performed a sequence analysis on members of the RTX family, searching for peptides homologous to the 841–872 epitope of leukotoxin, with the result that this sequence was found to be highly conserved among members of the family, including HlyA (residues 914–936). A mutant HlyA lacking this peptide (HlyA Δ914–936) was prepared and found to be incapable of binding erythrocytes or purified glycophorin. However, the 914–936 peptide (WR peptide) did bind pure glycophorin and protected red blood cells from HlyA hemolysis. Thus, residues 914–936 of HlyA appear to be essential for the toxin to bind its erythrocyte receptor, glycophorin. Materials—Horse red blood cells were supplied by Biomedics (Alcobendas, Spain). Human erythrocytes were obtained from a local blood bank. Glycophorin from horse or human erythrocyte ghosts was purified as described previously (8Cortajarena A.L. Goñi F.M. Ostolaza H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12513-12519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Egg phosphatidylcholine was Grade I from Lipid Products (South Nutfield, England). Rhodamine-phosphatidylethanolamine was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Hi-Trap desalting, Superdex HR-200, and N-hydroxysuccinimideactivated Hi-Trap columns were supplied by Amersham Biosciences. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Amersham Biosciences. Taq polymerase was purchased from Bioline (London, UK). Restriction enzymes NcoI, PacI, and the T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs (Hertforshire, UK). The restriction enzyme BseA1 was supplied by Roche Applied Science. WR peptide was synthesized, with >80% purity, by the Instituto de Inmunología de Colombia (Bogotá, Colombia). Mutagenesis of HlyA—The deletion mutant, lacking residues 914–936 of HlyA, was generated using the polymerase chain reaction. In the first step, fragments upstream and downstream of the deletion were amplified, in two separate reactions, using the flanking primers and the primers A and B, which flank the region to be deleted and introduce a BseA1 new restriction site. The two fragments were then digested with BseA1 and ligated. The resulting fragment was digested with NcoI and PacI and cloned into pSU124 restricted with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting plasmid contained an inserted fragment lacking the 914–936 region and with the new restriction endonuclease site. Deletion was confirmed by DNA sequencing as follows: flanking primers, 5′-GATATCTTCCATGGCGCGG-3′ and 5′-GATTTCATTAATTAATGGATTA-3′; primers (Δ914–936) A, 5′-ACCTGAATCCGGAGTGATTATGTTCCTGAATGTAATACCAT-3′, and B, 5′-ATAATCACTCCGGATTCCCTTAA-3′. The newly introduced restriction site is printed in bold. Protein Purification and Storage—Wild type HlyA and HlyA Δ914–936 were expressed in an E. coli D1210 strain containing plasmid pSU124 and purified as described by Ostolaza et al. (20Ostolaza H. Bartolomé B. Serra J.L. de la Cruz F. Goñi F.M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) for the wild type. The proteins were stored at –20°C in 150 mm NaCl, 6 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 buffer. Hemolysis Assays—A standard red blood cell suspension was used, obtained by diluting the erythrocytes with saline so that 37.5 μl of the mixture in 3 ml of distilled water gave an absorbance of 0.6 at 412 nm. Equal volumes of the standard suspension of washed human or horse erythrocytes were added to serial 2-fold dilutions of hemolysin in hemolysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) in a microtiter plate. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for a few hours so that erythrocyte sedimentation occurred. The absorbance of the supernatants, appropriately diluted with distilled water, was measured at 412 nm. The blank (zero hemolysis) consisted of a mixture of equal volumes of buffer and erythrocytes. Toxin Binding to Erythrocytes—Erythrocytes were washed and resuspended in hemolysis buffer at 2 × 108 cells/ml. The appropriate amounts of WT (wild type) or mutant HlyA were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g, for 10 min at room temperature. The pelleted cells were lysed at 4 °C with 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and washed in the same buffer by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The red blood cell membranes were resuspended in the same volume of 4% (w/v) SDS, 4% (w/v) glycerol, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 100 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 and boiled for 5 min. These samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose by the method of Towbin et al. (21Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (44841) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked with 10% skim milk in TBST buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (w/v), 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for 2 h at room temperature. They were then incubated with a solution containing a polyclonal rabbit anti-hemolysin antibody (1:1,000) in 5% skim milk/TBST overnight at 4 °C, washed with TBST buffer, and finally reacted with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig antibody (Sigma) (1:2,000) in TBST buffer with 5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblots were developed by a chemiluminescent method (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Toxin Binding to Phospholipid Vesicles—Toxin binding to large unilamellar vesicles composed of egg phosphatidylcholine was assayed by the flotation method of Pereira et al. (22Pereira F.B. Goñi F.M. Nieva J.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The vesicles were prepared (23Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar) containing 0.6 mole percentage of rhodamine-phosphatidylethanolamine and diluted to 250 μm in a D2O buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2,20mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0). Liposomes were incubated with protein for 1 h at 25 °C at 1:2,500 and 1:5,000 protein:lipid molar ratios. Then liposome-bound and non-bound proteins were separated by ultracentrifugation in a TLA 120.2 Beckman rotor (627,000 × g, 2 h, 20 °C). Liposomes containing bound protein floated on top of the buffer. This upper fraction was removed, liposomes were solubilized in detergent, and lipid and protein were quantitated by fluorescence. Lipid (rhodamine-phosphatidylethanolamine) fluorescence was measured at λex = 520 nm and λem = 590 nm. Protein (tryptophan) fluorescence was measured at λex = 280 nm and λem = 340 nm. Toxin Binding to Glycophorin—An N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Hi-Trap column (1 ml) from Amersham Biosciences was used to bind purified glycophorin. The column was first washed (3 × 2 ml) with cold 1 mm HCl to remove isopropyl alcohol. Then the purified glycophorin solution (0.5 mg/ml) prepared in the coupling buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 0.2 m NaHCO3, pH 8.3) was added and left overnight at 4 °C. The deactivation of any excess active groups that had not coupled to the ligand protein and the washing out of the nonspecifically bound ligands were performed following exactly the procedure described by the supplier. Binding of HlyA and HlyAΔ 914–936 was measured by adding to the affinity column 1 ml of protein (0.5 μm) in hemolysis buffer. After allowing 1 h for equilibration, the column was washed with the same buffer (4× column volume). The column was eluted first with a low pH buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.0) and then with a high salt buffer (1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0). The eluted fractions were neutralized, concentrated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. WR Peptide Binding to Glycophorin in Lipid Vesicles—Large unilamellar vesicles of egg phosphatidylcholine were prepared by the extrusion method of Mayer et al. (23Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar), using 0.1-μm pore size polycarbonate filters (Nuclepore, Pleasanton, CA). Glycophorin was reconstituted in lipid vesicles by the method of MacDonald and MacDonald (24MacDonald R.I. MacDonald R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9206-9214Google Scholar) at a final protein:lipid mole ratio of 1:1,000, as described previously (8Cortajarena A.L. Goñi F.M. Ostolaza H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12513-12519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), except that no fluorescent probes were entrapped in the vesicles. WR peptide binding was assayed through changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of the Trp residue in the peptide. Fluorescence emission increases when the peptide becomes membrane-bound. Peptide was added to the vesicle suspensions to a final concentration of 0.5 μm. After allowing 10 min for equilibration, fluorescence was excited at 280 nm, and emission spectra were recorded in the 300–400 nm range. Slits for excitation and emission were of 5 and 10 nm, respectively. The results are expressed as F/Fo, i.e. maximum fluorescence intensity in the presence/in the absence of protein. Protection against HlyA-induced Hemolysis by WR Peptide—Standard red blood cell suspensions were used, prepared as indicated above (A412 = 0.60). The cells were incubated in test tubes with varying amounts of WR peptide for 30 min at room temperature with stirring, and then hemolysis was started by adding 0.023 nm HlyA. The degree of hemolysis was measured at equilibrium as described above. The percent inhibition of hemolysis by WR peptide was calculated as 100× (hemolysis in the absence of WR peptide–hemolysis in the presence of WR peptide)/(hemolysis in the absence of WR peptide). Sequence Alignments—Analysis of RTX toxin sequences distal to the repeat domain revealed a conserved region analogous to the 841–872 epitope of leukotoxin (Fig. 2). The alignment showed that some high homology sequences coexisted with more variable ones. This may be related to the fact that some RTX toxins (leukotoxins) attack a narrow range of target cells, whereas others (hemolysins) are less specific (3Stanley P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 309-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The homologous region of HlyA, including residues 914–936, was the object of our experimental studies. It was designated as the WR peptide because of its initial and final amino acid residues. The HlyAΔ914–936 Deletion Mutant—HlyAΔ914–936 was expressed in E. coli in the same amounts as the WT (≈2 mg/liter culture filtrate) and could be purified following the same protocol (20Ostolaza H. Bartolomé B. Serra J.L. de la Cruz F. Goñi F.M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was recognized by the same polyclonal antibodies raised against WT HlyA (8Cortajarena A.L. Goñi F.M. Ostolaza H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12513-12519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, its lytic activity on horse or human red blood cells was of ∼104 times less than the WT (Fig. 3). This is in agreement with the idea that amino acids 914–936 are involved in HlyA binding to its erythrocyte receptor. If this were the case, the hemolysis observed at very high concentrations of HlyAΔ914–936 might be due to secondary receptor-binding domains in the toxin, in agreement with the suggestion by Bauer and Welch (25Bauer M.E. Welch R A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4665-4672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that several regions in the protein may be involved in cell binding. Other proposals have been made (26Lim K.B. Bazemore C.R. Guo L. Pellett S. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D. Hewlett E. Ludwig A. Goebel W. Welch R.A. Hackett M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36698-36702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Cruz W.T. Young R. Chang Y.F. Struck D.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1933-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) involving the acylated region and/or the repeat domain in cell binding. However, the results in Fig. 3 point to the WR peptide as the major structural element involved in HlyA binding to red blood cells. Note that, from the data in Fig. 3, horse erythrocytes appear to be more sensitive than human erythrocytes toward either WT or mutant HlyA. In Fig. 3, toxin concentrations producing 50% hemolysis are: horse, WT, 4.0 × 10–3 nM; horse, mutant, 1.1 × 102 nm; human, WT 3.0 × 10–2 nM; and human, mutant 4.2 × 102 nM. In view of these results, HlyAΔ914–936 binding to erythrocytes and lipid vesicles was measured in parallel with that of the WT. The proteins were incubated at various concentrations with red blood cells. The cells were washed and lysed, and membrane proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. WT and mutant HlyA were revealed by Western blotting with a polyclonal anti-HlyA antibody (8Cortajarena A.L. Goñi F.M. Ostolaza H. J. Biol.

Fig. 4 shows that WT HlyA, but not HlyAΔ914–936, could bind either horse or human erythrocyte membranes. The antibody was able to recognize the deletion mutant, as seen in lane C, bottom. The toxin concentrations used in this assay were such that they would cause, in the case of the WT, complete cell lysis. Thus, it can be concluded that the inability of the mutant to cause hemolysis (Fig. 3) is due to its abolished cell binding capacity. Deletion of amino acids 914–936 affects only the specific binding of HlyA to the cell surface receptors. Nonspecific binding (adsorption) (28Bakás L. Ostolaza H. Vaz W.L.C. Goñi F.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1869-1879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) to lipid bilayers is the same as that of the WT. For an initial protein:lipid ratio of 1:5,000, the percent nonspecific binding of WT was 42 ± 5.3%, and that of the deletion mutant was 41 ± 4.3% (n = 3). For an initial protein:lipid ratio of 1:10,000, the corresponding values were 35 ± 11.6% and 31 ± 7.3%, respectively (n = 3). To ascertain that the lack of binding of HlyAΔ914–936 to erythrocytes was due to a failure in recognizing the glycophorin receptor, the binding of WT and mutant HlyA to pure glycophorin immobilized in an affinity column was tested. Experiments using glycophorin purified from either horse or human erythrocytes were performed. Either mutant or WT HlyA was passed through the column in separate experiments. The column was repeatedly washed with buffer to remove unbound HlyA. Bound HlyA was eluted with a low pH buffer. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the bands were revealed with a silver stain (Fig. 5). In the case of WT HlyA, a band of the expected molecular weight was clearly seen in the first eluate fraction (Fig. 5, top gels, lane E1), whereas no comparable band was detected in the corresponding experiment with HlyAΔ914–936 (Fig. 5, bottom gels, lane E1). The E1 protein band in the experiment with human glycophorin is less strong than in the case of horse glycophorin. This was consistently observed in several independent experiments and may be related to the lower sensitivity of human versus horse red blood cells toward HlyA that was observed in Fig. 3. Thus, the main conclusion from Fig. 5 is that the deletion mutant was unable to bind glycophorin, and this explains its failure to bind erythrocytes (Fig. 4) and its inability to lyse them (Fig. 3). The WR Peptide—The WR peptide, representing residues 914–936 of HlyA, was synthesized and used in lysis and binding assays. These experiments were designed as a complement to those performed with the proteins lacking precisely this peptide. The WR peptide had no hemolytic activity of its own, even when assayed at very high concentrations (Fig. 6). To confirm that the region deleted in HlyAΔ914–936 participates in receptor binding, binding of the deleted WR peptide to glycophorin reconstituted in liposomes was assayed. For this purpose, phospholipid (egg phosphatidylcholine) vesicles were prepared containing glycophorin, as described in Ref. 24MacDonald R.I. MacDonald R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9206-9214Google Scholar. A fraction of these vesicles eluting as a symmetric peak from a Sepharose 2B-300 column was analyzed for protein and lipid P and found to contain phosphatidylcholine and glycophorin at a ≈1,000:1 mole ratio. Protein-free large unilamellar vesicles composed of pure egg phosphatidycholine were used as a control. Binding of WR peptide to reconstituted glycophorin was assessed through changes in the intrinsic Trp fluorescence of the peptide as a function of lipid concentration. Trp fluorescence increases when the peptide in solution binds the less polar membrane environment. The results in Fig. 7 demonstrate that WR peptide binds large unilamellar vesicles containing glycophorin, but does not bind to unilamellar vesicles not containing glycophorin. Protection by WR Peptide of HlyA-induced Hemolysis—In the absence of a direct proof of specific binding of WR peptide to glycophorin in erythrocytes, we have observed that pretreatment of red blood cells with the peptide decreases the extent of hemolysis induced by HlyA. The dose-dependent inhibition of hemolysis by the WR peptide is shown in Fig. 8. These data suggest that the peptide is binding the erythrocytes and subsequently preventing the specific binding of HlyA. Thus, this peptide would appear to be binding the specific receptor glycophorin. Conclusions—From the above experiments, we conclude that the HlyA region corresponding to amino acids 914–936 is a major determinant in the specific binding of HlyA to the red blood cell surface through glycophorin. The fact that a peptide containing amino acids 914–936 provides protection against an HlyA challenge may suggest a therapeutic application of this peptide in the extraintestinal E. coli infections in which HlyA has a pathogenic role. Moreover, homologous sequences of the WR peptide exist in other RTX toxins; thus, the results in this study can probably be extended to those toxins as well. The authors are indebted to the Instituto de Inmunología de Colombia for the generous gift of the WR peptide and to Professor R. N. McElhaney (University of Alberta) for reading and improving the manuscript."

To probe the cellular mechanism underlying the error-free and error-prone translesion DNA syntheses, in vitro primer extension experiments using purified DNA polymerases and site-specific α-OH-PdG were conducted. The results suggest the involvement of pol η in the cellular error-prone translesion synthesis. Experiments with xeroderma pigmentosum variant cells, which lack pol η, confirmed this hypothesis. The in vitro results also suggested the involvement of pol ι and/or REV1 in inserting correct dCMP opposite α-OH-PdG during error-free synthesis. However, none of translesion-specialized DNA polymerases catalyzed significant extension from a dC terminus when paired opposite α-OH-PdG. Thus, our results indicate the following. (i) Multiple DNA polymerases are involved in the bypass of α-OH-PdG in human cells. (ii) The accurate and inaccurate syntheses are catalyzed by different polymerases.

Several of these polymerases, such as eukaryotic pol η, pol κ, pol ι, pol ζ, and REV1 and Escherichia coli pol IV and pol V, are thought to be involved in translesion DNA synthesis.

These polymerases are different from replicative polymerases in several aspects, i.e. they replicate more efficiently across altered bases and catalyze both accurate and inaccurate translesion DNA syntheses, they have more flexible and larger catalytic pockets (5Ling H.

Their ability to catalyze translesion synthesis has been studied extensivelyin vitro using various DNA lesions as substrates, but knowledge of their roles in translesion synthesis in mammalian cells is still very fragmentary. Among these polymerases, pol η, which is defective in cells of xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV) patients, was shown to catalyze accurate and efficient translesion synthesis across certain UV photoproducts (15Masutani C.

In one pathway, both insertion and extension steps are catalyzed by one DNA polymerase.

Acrolein reacts with dG residues in DNA to form two pairs of stereoisomeric exocyclic propano adducts (Fig.1), namely the 8R and 8S isomers of 3H-8-hydroxy-3-(β-d-2′-deoxyribofuranosyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrido[3,2-a]purine-9-one (γ-OH-PdG) and the 6R and 6S isomers of 3H-6-hydroxy-3-(β-d-2′-deoxyribofuranosyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrido[3,2-a]purine-9-one (α-OH-PdG). γ-OH-PdG predominates over α-OH-PdG (30Chung F.-L.

Lipid peroxidation is suspected to be the major endogenous source (30Chung F.-L. Nath R.G. Nagao M. Nishikawa A. Zhou G.-D. Randerath K. Mutat. Res. 1999; 424: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Comparative genotoxic studies with a site-specific adduct in human cells have shown that γ-OH-PdG is less blocking than is α-OH-PdG (34Yang I.-Y. Chan G. Miller H. Huang Y. Torres M.C. Johnson F. Moriya M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13826-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and is bypassed with high fidelity (34Yang I.-Y. Chan G. Miller H. Huang Y. Torres M.C. Johnson F. Moriya M.

Toxicol. 2002; 15: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). α-OH-PdG, on the other hand, miscodes substantially in human cells with a frequency of 10–12% per bypass synthesis, with G→T being predominant (34Yang I.-Y. Chan G. Miller H. Huang Y. Torres M.C. Johnson F. Moriya M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13826-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As α-OH-PdG strongly inhibits DNA synthesis (34Yang I.-Y. Chan G. Miller H. Huang Y. Torres M.C. Johnson F. Moriya M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13826-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), it is likely that the translesion polymerases are involved in bypassing this adduct. This leads to the following questions: (i) which translesion polymerase is responsible for the correct and incorrect syntheses; and (ii) whether these syntheses are catalyzed by one polymerase or by different polymerases. Here, we show the following. (i) Multiple DNA polymerases are involved in the bypass synthesis. (ii) Pol η participates in incorrect synthesis. (iii) The current eukaryotic bypass model (19Guo D.

The procedures for the synthesis, purification, and characterization of oligonucleotides containing α-OH-PdG have been described (37Huang Y. Torres M.C. Johnson F. Bioorg. Chem. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). The 13-mer (5′-CTCCTCXATACCT-3′) and 28-mer (5′-CTGCTCCTCXATACCTACACGCTAGAAC-3′), in which X represents α-OH-PdG, were the same oligonucleotides as those used in our previous study (34Yang I.-Y. Chan G. Miller H. Huang Y. Torres M.C. Johnson F. Moriya M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13826-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The 13-mer and 28-mer were used in the translesion synthesis studies in vivo (human cells) and in vitro, respectively. The 16-mer (5′-GTTCTAGCGTGTAGGT-3′), 18-mer (5′-GTTCTAGCGTGTAGGTAT) and 19-mer (5′-GTTCTAGCGTGTAGGTATN-3′, in which N stands for A, G, C, or T) were employed as primers in the experiments of read-through nucleotide incorporation opposite α-OH-PdG and primer extension from a terminus opposite α-OH-PdG, respectively. The 28-mer template contained the entire sequence of the 13-mer.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. An expression vector containing a mouse XPV cDNA (mXPV) was constructed as follows. A NotI fragment containing mXPV was isolated from pGEM-mXPV (49Yamada A. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2473-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and cloned in the correct orientation into the NotI site of pIRESneo2 (Clontech), which has the G418 resistance gene. The construct, pIRES-mXPV, was introduced into CTag cells by the FuGENE6 method (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to a manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were selected for G418 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) resistance at 500 μg/ml medium. pIRESneo2 is designed to translate a cloned gene and the G418 resistance gene from the same transcript. As this transcript contains an internal ribosome entry site between the cloned gene and the G418 resistance gene, themXPV gene and the G418 resistance gene are independently translated. Furthermore, translation of the G418 resistance gene is designed to be less efficient than that of the cloned gene. Therefore, all G418-resistant cells are expected to express mXPV. To further assure the collection of mXPV-expressing cells, G418-resistant cells were irradiated with UV at 2J/m2 and then cultured in the presence of 1 mm caffeine (49Yamada A. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2473-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Almost all cells transfected with the empty pIRESneo2 vector died after 4 days, whereas cells transfected with pIRES-mXPV survived. Following two cycles of this phenotypic selection, surviving cells were used as the host for site-specific experiments. Finally, the transcription of the mXPV gene was confirmed by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen). The shuttle vector, pBTE, was described previously (35Yang I.-Y. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Moriya M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This vector is stably maintained in human cells and confers blasticidin S resistance to host human and E. coli cells. Expression of the resistance gene is driven by the SV40 early promoter in human cells and the EM7 bacterial promoter in E. coli. The construction of double-stranded DNA plasmid containing site-specific α-OH-PdG has been described (34Yang I.-Y. Chan G. Miller H. Huang Y. Torres M.C. Johnson F. Moriya M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13826-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and is shown in Fig.2 together with the experimental strategy. α-OH-PdG was incorporated into the leading strand template. An important feature of this construct is that the adduct was inserted opposite a unique SnaBI site (5′-TACGTA-3′) with mismatches on both sides of the adduct (Fig. 2); thus, only the unmodified complementary strand contains the SnaBI site. Progeny plasmids derived from the unmodified strand and excision repair events are sensitive to SnaBI digestion, whereas those derived from translesion synthesis are not. Hence, progeny derived from translesion synthesis can be selectively collected for fidelity analysis by digesting with SnaBI prior to E. colitransformation. CTag/pIRES and CTag/pIRES-mXPV cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/25-cm2 flask, cultured overnight, then transfected overnight with 1 μg of a DNA construct by the FuGENE6 method. Where indicated, cells were treated with mitomycin C at 1 μg/ml medium for 50 min in an incubator, after which the medium was replaced with a fresh medium, and transfection was begun immediately. The next day, cells were detached by treating with trypsin-EDTA and replated in a 75-cm2 flask. The following day, blasticidin S (Invitrogen) was added to the culture medium at 5 μg/ml. Resistant cells were collected after 5 or 6 days. The progeny plasmid was purified by the method of Hirt (50Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3350) Google Scholar) and treated with DpnI (2 units) for 1 h to remove residual input DNA. To establish the apparent efficiency of translesion DNA synthesis,DpnI-treated plasmid was used to transform E. coli. To determine coding events at the site of α-OH-PdG, theDpnI-treated plasmid was digested with SnaBI prior to transformation. One-tenth to one-fifth of the recovered plasmid was electroporated into E. coli DH10B ElectroMAX (25 μl) (Invitrogen) by an E. coli Pulser (Bio-Rad), after which 975 μl of YT (2×) medium (36Yang I.-Y.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9071-9076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was added, and the bacteria were cultured for 40 min at 37 °C. Portions of the transformation mixture were plated onto YT (1×) plates containing blasticidin S (50 μg/ml) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml). After overnight incubation, E. coli transformants were subjected to differential oligonucleotide hybridization (51Pandya G. Moriya M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11487-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 52Pandya G.A. Yang I.-Y. Grollman A.P. Moriya M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6598-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) to analyze for mutations in the adducted region. This method permits the detection of specific sequences using oligonucleotide probes. G, T, A, C, and D probes (Fig. 2C) determine coding specificity at the site of α-OH-PdG. The S probe hybridizes to the complementary SnaBI-containing strand. L and R probes confirm the presence of the 13-mer insert. Automated DNA sequence analysis was performed as necessary. To understand the mechanism of the translesion synthesis across α-OH-PdG in human cells, we first conducted in vitroexperiments to select candidate polymerases whose translesion synthesis activity and fidelity are consistent with the in vivoresults, and we then examined the role of one (pol η) of the candidates in human cells. A running start experiment (Fig. 3) using a 16-mer primer and a 28-mer template showed that pol δ bypassed α-OH-PdG very weakly only in the presence of PCNA. Extended products were not observed opposite the adduct, and the majority of the extension was terminated at one base before the adduct site. These results suggest that nucleotide insertion opposite α-OH-PdG and the subsequent extension are poor. When the read-through experiment was catalyzed by exo+ Klenow enzyme, full-length products were rarely observed, and some extended products were observed opposite the adduct. These results suggest that the full-length products observed in the pol δ-catalyzed reaction were generated by true bypass synthesis across the adduct. No stable insertion of a nucleotide opposite α-OH-PdG by pol δ was confirmed by nucleotide incorporation experiments using 10 and 100 μm dNTP (Fig. 4). The results of these experiments indicate that pol δ/PCNA catalyzes bypass of α-OH-PdG very weakly. At this time the fidelity of this bypass synthesis is not known. In subsequent experiments designed to determine the nucleotide distance between the adduct and the primer terminus at which pol δ/PCNA recovered efficient synthesis, we found that exonucleolytic proofreading prevailed over polymerization when the primer terminus was located three nucleotides or less 5′ to the adduct (Fig.5). When the terminus was five nucleotides away, net polymerization efficiency increased. At seven nucleotides, proofreading became marginal, and polymerization was predominant. Therefore, if a translesion polymerase catalyzes DNA synthesis ≥7 nucleotides past α-OH-PdG, the subsequent synthesis can be performed efficiently by pol δ. As α-OH-PdG inhibits DNA synthesis strongly, it is conceivable that translesion polymerases participate in bypassing this adduct. To determine which polymerase(s) plays a role in the accurate and inaccurate bypass syntheses, we first examined the abilities of pol η and pol κ to catalyze a by"

HSE-derived NO and H2O2 caused GSH depletion and a decrease in γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase activity in iB16M cells. Overexpression of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase heavy and light subunits led to a rapid recovery of cytosolic GSH, whereas mitochondrial GSH (mtGSH) further decreased during the first 18 h of culture. NO and H2O2 damaged the mitochondrial system for GSH uptake (rates in iB16M were approximately 75% lower than in LD B16M cells). iB16M cells also showed a decreased activity of mitochondrial complexes II, III, and IV, less O2 consumption, lower ATP levels, higher O2⨪ and H2O2 production, and lower mitochondrial membrane potential. In vitro growing iB16M cells maintained high viability (>98%) and repaired HSE-induced mitochondrial damages within 48 h.

Recently, we studied in vitro the tumoricidal mechanism of endothelial cells and found that H2O2 was not cytotoxic in the absence of NO (6Carretero J. Obrador E. Esteve J.M. Ortega A. Pellicer J.A.

However, NO-induced tumor cytotoxicity was increased by H2O2 because of the formation of potent oxidants, likely ⋅OH and −ONOO radicals, via a trace metal-dependent process (6Carretero J. Obrador E.

A high percentage of B16M cells with high GSH (γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine) content survived the combined nitrosative and oxidative attack and may represent the main task force in metastatic invasion (6Carretero J.

In agreement with this concept, previous in vivo video microscopic studies on the viability of intraportally injected B16M cells left untreated and or treated with l-buthionine (S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) (a specific inhibitor of GSH synthesis) (7Meister A. Science. 1983; 220: 470-477Crossref Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), arrested in mouse liver microvasculature, showed that the rate of tumor cell death increased dramatically in GSH-depleted cells (8Anasagasti M.J.

Therefore, because GSH content and metastatic growth appear to be directly related (9Carretero J. Obrador E. Anasagasti M.J. Martin J.J. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Estrela J.M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10Obrador E. Carretero J. Ortega A. Medina I. Rodilla V. Pellicer J.A. Estrela J.M. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), maintenance of high intracellular levels of GSH may be critical for the extravascular growth of those metastatic cells that survive after interaction with the endothelium. Thus, we investigated GSH homeostasis in this metastatic cell subset and found that invasive melanoma (iB16M) cells show an impairment in the mitochondrial system for GSH uptake. This is important because mitochondrial GSH (mtGSH) depletion may facilitate mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, permeability transition pore opening, and the release of apoptosis-inducing molecular signals (11Obrador E. Carretero J. Esteve J.M. Pellicer J.A. Pascual A. Petschen I. Estrela J.M. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 642-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our results reveal that NO and H2O2 damage the high and the low affinity components of this system. This fact can challenge iB16M cells to maintain their physiological mtGSH levels under conditions of low cytosolic GSH (cytGSH) levels (<1 mm). We propose that maintenance of mtGSH homeostasis may be a limiting factor for the survival of metastatic cells in the immediate period following intrasinusoidal arrest and interaction with activated vascular endothelial cells.

Male C57BL/6J mice (10–12 weeks old) were from IFFA Credo (L'Arbreole, France) and received care according to the criteria outlined by the National Institutes of Health. Hepatic sinusoidal endothelium (HSE) was separated and identified as previously described (12Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Rocha M. Asumendi A. Barbera-Guillem E. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 328-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sinusoidal cells were separated in a 17.5% (w/v) metrizamide gradient. Cultures of HSE were established and maintained in pyrogen-free DMEM supplemented as described above for the B16M cells. Differential adhesion of endothelial cells to the collagen matrix and washing allows a complete elimination of other sinusoidal cell types (Kupffer, stellate, and lymphocytes) from the culture flasks. B16M cells were loaded with 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-and-6-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethylester (BCECF-AM; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (106 cells were incubated in 1 ml of HEPES-buffered DMEM, containing 50 μg of BCECF-AM and 5 μl of Me2SO, for 20 min at 37 °C). After washing, BCECF-AM-containing cells were resuspended in HEPES-buffered DMEM without phenol red at a concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml and added (0.2 ml/well) to endothelial cells (plated 24 h before) and also to plastic or collagen precoated control wells. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C, and 20 min later the wells were washed three times with fresh medium and read for fluorescence using a Fluoroskan Ascent FL (Labsystems, Manchester, UK). The number of adhering tumor cells was quantified by arbitrary fluorescence units based on the percentage of the initial number of B16M cells added to the HSE culture (4Anasagasti M.J. Alvarez A.

Anti-Met-72 monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry-coupled cell sorting were used to isolate viable B16M cells after co-culture with HSE cells. Anti-Met-72 monoclonal antibodies, which react with a 72-kDa cell surface protein (Met-72) expressed at high density on B16M clones of high metastatic activity, were produced as previously described (14Kimura A.K. Xiang J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1986; 76: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) through syngenic immunizations of C57BL/6J mice with clones of B16M-F10. B16M and HSE cell dispersion was carried out by trypsinization (in Mg2+- and Ca2+-free PBS supplemented with 0.2% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm glucose for 3 min at 37 °C). Then cells were washed three times in PBS and resuspended in DMEM, and an aliquot containing 2 × 106 of B16M cells was incubated with a predetermined excess of anti-Met-72 monoclonal antibody for 1 h on ice. After three washings with PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgF(ab)2 (Cappel Laboratories, Westchester, PA) for 1 h on ice. After another three washing steps with PBS at 4 °C, the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, filtered through a 44-μm pore mesh and analyzed using an EPICS ELITE (Coulter Electronics, Hieleah, FL). Fluorescent B16M cells were separately gated for cell sorting and collected into individual tissue culture chambered slides (Nalge Nunc International Corp., Naperville, IL). Then the sorted iB16M cells were harvested and plated in 25-cm2polystyrene flasks (Falcon Labware) as above.

J. 1982; 204: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the B16M cell suspension (1 ml containing 25 × 106 cells) was mixed at 4 °C with a digitonin solution (4 ml containing 2 mm digitonin, 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm MOPS, and 3 mmEDTA, pH 7.0) for 30 s. The mixture (5 ml) was then taken to a previously prepared propylene tube (containing two layers: 2.5 ml of 200 mm mannitol, 50 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MOPS, 5 mmKH2PO4, and 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH, at the bottom; and 2.5 ml of AR200 silicone oil from Serva, Heidelberg, Germany, at the top), placed on the silicone oil layer, and centrifuged immediately (10,000 ×g for 30 s at 4 °C). Up to 98% of the total lactate dehydrogenase activity was found in the supernatant (cytosolic fraction). The cytosolic compartment contained maximally 2.5 and 0% of the total amount of glutamate dehydrogenase and cytochrome coxidase, respectively. The high percentage of the total lactate dehydrogenase found in the supernatant of centrifugation shows that a complete rupture of the plasma membrane occurs. On the other side, digitonin fractionation did not damage the mitochondria, as shown by the very low percentages of glutamate dehydrogenase and cytochromec oxidase found in the supernatant. Contamination of the lower phase with supernatant from above the oil was estimated to be 1.38 ± 0.05 μl/mg dry weight (n = 6) in parallel fractionations where B16M cells were preincubated for 10 min in the presence of 0.5 μCi of 3H2O/ml and 0.2 μCi of [U-14C]inuline/ml (Amersham Biosciences). The inuline-impermeable space was found to be 0.12 ± 0.02 μl/mg cell dry weight, a value that represents 13.6 ± 2.7% (n = 7) of cell volume. The samples (2 ml) were removed from the lower phase (mitochondria-enriched fraction) by inserting a syringe through the oil and rapidly layered on to an ice-cold Percoll gradient prepared in 13.5-ml polycarbonate tubes. Previously, the Percoll (Sigma) was passed through a Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad) chelating ion exchange resin to remove contaminating cations. The step gradient corresponded to approximately 60, 50, 40, and 30% Percoll (v/v; 2.5 ml was the volume for each phase) in medium containing 200 mmmannitol, 50 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm sodium succinate, 1 mm ADP, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol in 10 mm MOPS/KOH buffer, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 32,000 ×g for 45 s in a Centrikon T1075 refrigerated centrifuge (Kontron Instruments, Zürich, Switzerland) fitted with a fixed angle TFT 60.13 rotor. The gradients were fractionated into 10 fractions, and the distribution of organelles was analyzed with cytochrome c oxidase, glucose 6-phosphatase, 5′-nucleotidase, acid phosphatase, and catalase as marker enzymes for mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, lysosomes, and peroxisomes, respectively. Because only mitochondria were required, the gradient was aspirated to the 40–50% interface, and the mitochondrial fraction was removed by automatic pipette, and resuspended to a final protein concentration of 20 mg/ml (n = 10). All of the operations were performed at 4 °C. Enzyme activities recovered in the purified mitochondrial fraction (expressed as a percentage of each total activity measured in B16M cells) were 74 ± 9% of cytochrome c oxidase, 1 ± 0.5% of glucose 6-phosphatase, 2 ± 1% of 5′-nucleotidase, 2 ± 0.5% of acid phosphatase, and 3 ± 1% of catalase (n = 12). Cytochrome c oxidase was measured as described below; glutamate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphatase, 5′-nucleotidase, and acid phosphatase were measured as described by Bergmeyer (17Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1985Google Scholar); and catalase was measured as described by Aebi (18Aebi H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (17772) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy (see below for technical details) applied to mitochondria isolated from LD B16M or iB16M cells showed normal mitochondrial shapes without swelling or damage of the mitochondrial crests or other structures (not shown). For functional characterization, mitochondrial respiration in the absence and in the presence of ADP (0.2 mm) was measured using a Clark-type oxygen electrode in an incubation medium containing 100 mmsucrose, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmKH2PO4, 50 mm MOPS, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm sodium succinate, pH 7.4. Oxygen uptake in states 3 and 4 was 121 ± 27 and 23 ± 8 nmol of O2/min/mg of protein, respectively, in mitochondria isolated from LD B16M cells (12 h cultured) and 53 ± 7 and 11 ± 4 nmol of O2/min/mg of protein, respectively, in mitochondria isolated from iB16M cells (18 h cultured) (n = 12 in both cases). B16M cells were detached (see above), washed twice at 4 °C in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate medium (without Ca2+ or Mg2+) containing 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, resuspended, and homogenized in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 4 °C. γ-Glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) and GSH synthetase activities were measured as described elsewhere (10Obrador E. Carretero J. Ortega A. Medina I. Rodilla V. Pellicer J.A. Estrela J.M. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). GSH transferase activity was determined as previously described (9Carretero J. Obrador E. Anasagasti M.J. Martin J.J. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Estrela J.M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated by the acid phenol-guanidine method (19Chomozynsky P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA was obtained using a random hexamer primer and a MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase kit as described by the manufacturer (TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A PCR master mix containing the specific primers (γ-GCS heavy subunit (γ-GCS-HS): forward, 5′-ATC CTC CAG TTC CTG CAC ATC TAC, and reverse, 5′-GAT CGA AGG ACA CCA ACA TGT ACTC; γ-GCS light subunit (γ-GCS-LS): forward, TGG AGT TGC ACA GCT GGA CTC T, and reverse, 5′-CCA GTA AGG CTG TAA ATG CTC CAA; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: forward, 5′-CCT GGA GAA ACC TGC CAA GTA TG, and reverse, 5′-GGT CCT CAG TGT AGC CCA AGA TG) and AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) were then added. Real time quantitation of γ-GCS-HS and γ-GCS-LS mRNA relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was performed with a SYBR Green I assay and evaluated using a iCycler detection system (Bio-Rad). Target cDNAs were amplified in separate tubes using the following procedure: 10 min at 95 °C, then 40 cycles of amplification (denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min/cycle). The increase in fluorescence was measured in real time during the extension step. The threshold cycle (CT) was determined, and then the relative gene expression was expressed as follows: fold change = 2−Δ(ΔCT), where ΔCT = CT target −CT glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and Δ(ΔCT) = ΔCTtreated − ΔCT control. Isolated mitochondria were resuspended in incubation medium and used immediately after B16M cell fractionation (see above) to avoid any loss of their initial GSH content. Using a variation of the technique described by Martenssonet al. (20Martensson J. Lai J.C.K. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7185-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), the net rates of GSH uptake into the matrix were measured at 25 °C in mixtures (volume, 500 μl) containing incubation medium and 0.1–10 mm (1 μCi/assay) [35S]GSH (see the legend to Fig. 2). Uptake was initiated by adding 20 μl of the mitochondrial suspension (final concentration, 1 mg of protein/ml). Protein was determined by the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The incubations were terminated by centrifugation of the mitochondria through Ficoll at 10,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The mitochondrial pellet was washed twice at 4 °C with a medium containing 0.3 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MOPS, 5 mm KH2PO4, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fatty acid free), adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH, to remove GSH from the intermembranous space and then suspended in 50 μl of 5% sulfosalicylic acid and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 3 min. The 35S was measured in the supernatant, whereas the residual pellet was treated as previously described (20Martensson J. Lai J.C.K. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7185-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) to measure matrix protein-bound GSH, which was 8–10% of the total mtGSH in all of our experimental conditions. The net rates of GSH uptake into mitochondria were estimated in intact B16M cells by using a variation of the technique described by Lash (22Lash L.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) for renal cells. B16M cells (approximately 5 mg of dry weight/ml) were suspended at 37 °C in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate medium, pH 7.4, and the incubations were performed in 25-ml Erlenmeyer flasks in a Clifton shaking water bath (60 cycles/min). Glucose (5 mm) was always present. The gas atmosphere was O2/CO2 (19:1). Cell membrane integrity was determined as previously described (23Estrela J.M. Hernandez R. Terradez P. Asensi M. Puertes I.R. Viña J. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To prevent possible GSH degradation, B16M cells were pretreated with acivicin (l-(αS,5S)-α-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid; an irreversible inhibitor of γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (24Reed D.J. Ellis W.W. Meck R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 1273-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar)) (Sigma) (0.1 mm) for 15 min prior to the addition of GSH. After this period, GSH (2 mm, containing 2 μCi of [35S]GSH from PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and bathophenanthroline disulfonate (0.1 mm; to minimize metal ion-catalyzed GSH oxidation) were added to the incubation mixture, which was then taken to an electroporation unit for eukaryotic cells (Bio-Rad) to permeabilize cell membranes and allow uptake of intact GSH molecules into the cytosol. The field strength applied to each sample was of 1.0 kV/cm with a time constant of 50 ms. The cells were washed twice in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate medium, pH 7.4, to remove extracellular GSH and then were incubated again, as described above. Kinetics of mtGSH transport was calculated after B16M cell fractionation was applied as explained above. GSH monoisopropyl(glycyl) ester was prepared as previously described (25Martensson J. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). All of the enzyme activities were measured spectrophotometrically with a double-beam, dual wavelength spectrophotometer (Cecil Instruments, Cambridge, UK) by suspending 0.1 mg of protein of mitochondrial particles prepared by freezing and thawing (three times) of isolated mitochondria in a medium containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 25 mm EDTA (final volume, 1.5 ml) at 25 °C. NADH-CoQ oxidoreductase (complex I) was assayed by following the rotenone-sensitive initial rate of NADH oxidation at 360–374 nm (Δε = 2.3 mm−1·cm−1). The basic reaction medium also contained 30 mm NADH, 1.5 mm antimycin A, and 1.5 mm KCN. The reaction was initiated by adding 50 mm decyl-ubiquinone. Succinate-CoQ oxidoreductase (complex II) was assayed by following the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol at 600 nm (Δε = 19.1 mm−1·cm−1). The basic reaction medium also contained 1 mg/ml rotenone, 1.5 mm antimycin A, 1.5 mm KCN, 50 mm 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, and 10 mm succinate. The reaction was initiated by adding 50 mm decyl-ubiquinone. Ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III) was assayed by following at 540–550 nm the initial rate of antimycin-sensitive cytochrome c reduction upon the addition of 10 mm reduced decyl-ubiquinone. The reduced quinine was obtained from the oxidized form as previously described (26Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction medium also contained 1 mg/ml rotenone, 1.5 mmKCN, and 10 mm ferricytochrome c. Cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) activity was estimated from the initial rate of ferrocytochrome c oxidation at 540–550 nm. The reaction mixture was supplemented with 10 mm ferrocytochrome c and 1.5 mmantimycin A. The reaction was started by the addition of mitochondrial particles. The assay of H2O2 production was based, as previously reported (6Carretero J. Obrador E. Esteve J.M. Ortega A. Pellicer J.A. Vera Sempere F. Estrela J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25775-25782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) on the H2O2-dependent oxidation of the homovanillic acid (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) to a highly fluorescent dimer (2,2′-dihydroxydiphenyl-5,5′-diacetic acid) that is mediated by horse-radish peroxidase (27Ruch W. Cooper P.H. Baggiolini M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 63: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Nitrite and nitrate determinations were performed as previously described (6Carretero J. Obrador E. Esteve J.M. Ortega A. Pellicer J.A. Vera Sempere F. Estrela J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 27"

We previously cloned the genes expressed early in the differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells. One of them, similar in sequence to human TC10, was identified as TC10-like/TC10βLong (TCL/TC10βL), a new Rho GTPase by the cloning of full-length cDNA. The expression of TCL/TC10βL increased rapidly right after the addition of inducers for differentiation, whereas the levels of other Rho family genes were unchanged at this stage. The antisense TCL/TC10βL-expressing experiment revealed that the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes was inhibited. Moreover, the sense TCL/TC10βL-expressing experiment using NIH-3T3 cells, which do not usually differentiate into adipocytes, clearly showed the accumulation of oil droplets as well as the elevated expression of various adipogenic marker genes in the presence of the ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). These results strongly indicated that TCL/TC10βL has a crucial role in the early stage of adipocyte differentiation, probably linked to the PPARγ pathway. Using a subtraction protocol, the genes specifically regulated by TCL/TC10βL were also isolated. The expression pattern of some of them was similar to TCL/TC10βL expression in adipogenesis, suggesting that the expression of these genes would be regulated by TCL/TC10βL.

In addition, it secretes many cytokines and other proteins, such as leptin, adiponectin, adipsin, tumor necrosis factor-α, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. These secreted proteins have crucial roles in regulating food intake and the insulin sensitivity/resistance in diabetes mellitus, as well as in obesity (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S.

Obesity is a ringleader for many diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipoidemia, and also arteriosclerosis (5Kopelman P.G. Nature. 2000; 404: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (3642) Google Scholar). Therefore, further insight into the molecular basis of obesity is required. Three families of transcription factor proteins have been identified and characterized as the master regulators of adipocyte differentiation (6Brun R.P. Kim J.B. Hu E. Altiok S. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)1 is a key transcription factor for the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes and activates the many adipocyte-specific genes including the aP2, lipoprotein lipase, and resistin genes (8Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar,9Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar). The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family also has been identified as master regulators. Notably, C/EBPα activates the expression of PPARγ, as well as leptin and the insulin receptor (7Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,10Schwarz E.J. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Krakow S.L. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wu Z.

The expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ is preceded by that of C/EBPα and induces PPARγ expression (6Brun R.P. Kim J.B. Hu E. Altiok S. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 12Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) functions as a regulator for lipid homeostasis, and this protein is also known to be an activator for the ligand production of PPARγ (7Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5495-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Thus, the middle and late stages of adipocyte differentiation are relatively well characterized. However, the events at the early stage of adipogenesis are not fully understood. In previous reports, we identified 102 genes as inducible at the earliest stage of adipocyte differentiation by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) subtraction protocol (15Imagawa M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Nishizuka M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These include genes for transcription factors and signaling proteins. It is of interest that almost half of them are unknown genes that are not found in the data bases. The main reason for this is likely to be that the isolated fragments are too short to identify the genes. Therefore, in a previous study, we performed a preliminary analysis using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique and, by partial sequencing, identified clone 26 as mouse TC10, similar in sequence to human TC10, one of the Rho family (15Imagawa M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, recent findings by two groups have revealed the existence of one more Rho family member (17Vignal E. De Toledo M. Comunale F. Ladopoulou A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Blangy A. Fort P. J. Biol.

TC10-like (TCL) was identified from human and mouse EST (expressed sequence tag) data bases sharing 95% sequence similarity with human TCL, which has 10 more amino acids in the N-terminal portion (17Vignal E.

TC10β was identified as a mouse ortholog of TC10 (18Chiang S.H. Hou J.C. Hwang J. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13067-13073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TC10β has an isoform, TC10βL, which has 10 more amino acids at the N terminus. In the present study, we isolated the full-length cDNA of clone 26 and by sequence analysis revealed that our mouse clone 26 is identical to TC10βL (18Chiang S.H. Hou J.C. Hwang J. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13067-13073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and also to the longer form of TCL (17Vignal E. De Toledo M. Comunale F.

Therefore, in the present paper we refer to clone 26 as TCL/TC10βL. The Rho family of small GTPases makes up a large gene family, which can be divided into two groups; one group includes RhoA, -B, -C, -D, -E, and -L and Rnd1–3, and the other includes Rac1–3, Rho G, TTF/RhoH, Chp, Cdc42, TC10, and TCL/TC10βL (20Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Rho proteins act as molecular switches to control cellular processes by cycling between the active, GTP-bound and inactive, GDP-bound states. Several lines of evidence in the past few years have revealed that Rho proteins have important roles in many cellular events, such as membrane trafficking, transcriptional regulation, control of cell growth, and development (20Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 21Mackey D.J.G. Hall A. J. Biol.

(24Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R.

However, the roles of Rho proteins have not been elucidated in terms of adipocyte differentiation. In our previous report (15Imagawa M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), clone 26 (TCL/TC10βL in the present paper) was strongly expressed at the early stage of adipocyte differentiation; this induction is specific to growth-arrested cells, a state that is essential for adipocyte differentiation. These findings prompted us to further characterize the functional roles of TCL/TC10βL. In the present study, we blocked the expression of TCL/TC10βL using the Lac Switch mammalian expression system, which produces antisense TCL/TC10βL. The inhibition of TCL/TC10βL expression in 3T3-L1 cells prevented the cytoplasmic accumulation of triglyceride and decreased the expression of adipogenic related genes. We next used a retroviral system to over-express TCL/TC10βL stably in NIH-3T3 cells. The constitutive over-expression of TCL/TC10βL is sufficient to cause the adipocyte differentiation of these cells in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), dexamethasone (Dex), insulin (Ins), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and the PPARγ ligand BRL49653. Furthermore, using the PCR-cDNA subtraction system, we isolated several clones as candidates for the downstream target genes of TCL/TC10βL. Some of the isolated genes were also induced during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. These results strongly suggest that TCL/TC10βL has crucial roles in the program of adipocyte differentiation. The full-length cDNA for clone 26 was isolated by 5′-RACE analysis. The 5′-RACE reaction was performed using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences were determined with the automated DNA sequencer DSQ 1000 (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) and ABI PRISM 310 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The mouse 3T3-L1 (ATCC CL173) preadipocytes and mouse NIH-3T3 (clone 5611, JCRB 0615, Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank) fibroblast cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% calf serum. For the differentiation experiment, the medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 0.5 mm IBMX, 10 μg/ml Ins, 1 μm Dex, and 10% FBS at 2 days postconfluence (15Imagawa M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After 2 days, the cells were transferred to DMEM containing 5 μg/ml Ins and 10% FBS, and then the cells were refed every 2 days. BRL49653, the ligand for PPARγ (a gift from GlaxoSmithKline), was also added at a final concentration of 0.5 μm. The packaging cell line PT67 (Clontech) was maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Stable transformants expressing antisense TCL/TC10βL under the regulation of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) were developed using a Lac Switch II inducible mammalian expression system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fragment containing the stretch between −11 and +241 (assigning A in start codon ATG for the first methionine from the 5′-portion as +1) was amplified by PCR using the primers with the restriction sites for SpeI and XhoI, respectively. After enzyme digestion of the amplified fragment, the resultant fragment was subcloned into a site in pOPRSVI/MCS in the antisense orientation. The sequence of the inserted fragment was confirmed as described above. 3T3-L1 cells were grown to 60–70% confluency and co-transfected with pCMVLac1, which expresses the Lac repressor protein, and pOPRSV1/MCS antisense TCL/TC10βL or pOPRSVI without the insert using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). The stable transformant was selected in the presence of both 400 μg/ml neomycin (G418) and 150 μg/ml hygromycin. The drug-resistant clones were removed individually and stored. The TCL/TC10βL expression vector (pDON-AI-TCL/TC10βL) was constructed by ligating the full-length cDNA encoding mouse TCL/TC10βL. The full-length mouse TCL/TC10βL cDNA was amplified from 3T3-L1 cells from total RNA by RT-PCR. The PCR products were ligated into the SalI site of pDON-AI (Takara Biomedicals, Kusatsu, Japan). PT67 cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes and transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation with 14 μg of pDON-AI-TCL/TC10βL plasmid. After a 48-h transfection, the viral supernatants were collected and used to infect NIH-3T3 fibroblasts at 50% confluence in 100-mm dishes. Polybrene (4 μg/ml) was added to the viral supernatants before treatment. After a 24-h incubation with viral supernatant, cells were split and replaced in DMEM containing 10% calf serum and 400 μg/ml of neomycin (G418) to select infected cells for 2 weeks. The drug-resistant clones were removed individually and stored. The cells were harvested at a specific time. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The mRNA was isolated from total RNA using Oligotex-dT30 (Daiichi Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) for 5′-RACE. For RT-PCR, cDNA was prepared using AMV Reverse Transcriptase XL (Takara Biomedicals) following the manufacturer's recommended procedures. The PCR was done under the appropriate conditions. The PCR fragments were stained with ethidium bromide, and the intensities were determined with a fluoroimager (FluorImager 595, Amersham Biosciences). For Northern blot analyses, 25 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde and then transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The filter was hybridized with each probe, which was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random labeling kit (Takara Biomedicals). The radioactivity corresponding to each band was measured with a bioimage analyzer (BAS2000, Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The subtraction cloning with PCR was performed using a PCR-select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech) as described previously (15Imagawa M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For this purpose, two stable cell lines, NIH-TCL/TC10βL (a stable cell line integrated with pDON-AI-TCL/TC10βL) and NIH-vector (a stable cell line integrated with the pDON-AI control vector) were used. These cells were harvested before and at 2 days after induction, and Poly (A)+ RNA was prepared from each cell. We previously isolated genes expressed at the beginning of the differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 cells (15Imagawa M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Nishizuka M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Of these, 46 were unknown genes not found in any data bases. Clone 26 was expressed very strongly and specifically during adipocyte differentiation. This induction is not caused by just a change in medium without the differentiation mixture, because the expression of clone 26 was not observed in fresh medium without inducers (15Imagawa M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, when IBMX was omitted from the differentiation mixture, the induction did not occur, indicating that IBMX is a principal inducer (15Imagawa M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because clone 26 is obtained as a small DNA fragment, we next attempted to isolate the full-length cDNA of this gene. Using 5′-RACE analysis, PCR products ∼800 bp long were obtained, and sequence analysis showed a predicted protein that encodes 214 amino acids (data not shown). In amino acid sequence, clone 26 showed 79.1% similarity to human TC10, which is one of the Rho family (19Drivas G.T. Shin A. Coutavas E. Rush M.G. D'eustachio P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). As a result of a data base search, we first regarded this gene as a mouse homolog of human TC10. However, Vignal et al. (17Vignal E. De Toledo M. Comunale F. Ladopoulou A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Blangy A. Fort P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36457-36464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) reported human and mouse TCL (TC10-like), a new GTPase of the Rho family related to TC10. The sequence analysis revealed 95% similarity between human and mouse, with the only major difference being found in the N-terminal portion, where human TCL is 10 amino acids longer than mouse TCL. Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of our clone 26 is the same as that of mouse TCL, except it has 10 more amino acids at the N terminus, which is exactly the same length as the human TCL sequence. While we were preparing this manuscript, Chiang et al. (18Chiang S.H. Hou J.C. Hwang J. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13067-13073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) reported a related TC10 isoform involved in insulin-stimulated glucose transport and referred to TC10 and the new isoform as TC10α and TC10β, respectively (18Chiang S.H. Hou J.C. Hwang J. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13067-13073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). TC10β has two isoforms, and they named the longer variant TC10βL (TC10βLong). It was found that mouse TC10βL is identical to our clone 26 and of the same length as human TCL and also that TC10β is equal to mouse TCL. Therefore, we refer to our clone 26 as TCL/TC10βL, as a longer form of TCL, throughout this study. The expression of TCL/TC10βL was markedly elevated, whereas TC10α was involved in glucose transport in a late stage of adipocyte differentiation. These results indicated functional differences between TC10α and -β. Therefore, we next determined the expression profiles of Rho family genes including TCL/TC10βL and TC10α. We investigated the expression of TCL/TC10βL and other family members during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes. The expression levels of TCL/TC10βL quickly elevated after the induction, reaching a peak at 3 h. The expression of TC10α was only slightly detectable before the induction, and it decreased after the induction. However, it increased clearly in the late stage (Fig.1). The levels of other Rho family members, such as RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, were unchanged throughout the incubation, indicating the specific expression of TCL/TC10βL and TC10α in adipocyte differentiation. As described above, TC10β has two isoforms that differ in the N-terminal portion. Therefore, we next performed RT-PCR analyses to determine the expression levels of these two isoforms during adipogenesis. Because the first three amino acids were the same between the short and long forms of TC10β, we speculated that the shorter form of TC10β is a splicing isoform and designed PCR primers for the detection of both isoforms. The PCR analyses detected that only TC10βL, suggesting that the long form of TC10β (TCL/TC10βL) was specifically expressed in adipocytes (data not shown); however, we cannot rule out the possibility of sequence differences in the 5′-untranslated region due to the usage of different promoters. To gain insight into the biological functions of TCL/TC10βL, we first attempted to block the expression of TCL/TC10βL during preadipocyte differentiation using the Lac Switch mammalian expression system. We co-transfected pOPRSV1-TCL/TC10βL antisense and pCMVLac1 into mouse 3T3-L1 cells. As a control, a cell line transfected with pCMVLac1 and pOPRSVI without the insert was also developed. By selection, using G418 and hygromycin, we isolated stable transformants, antisense TCL/TC10βL-expressing cells and control cells. 5 mm IPTG was added to the medium 12 h before treatment with inducers for the differentiation. The level of expression of the TCL/TC10βL mRNA was determined by RT-PCR. In TCL/TC10βL antisense cells, the expression level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, used as a control, did not change with or without IPTG. In contrast, the expression of TCL/TC10βL decreased at 3 h in the presence of IPTG (Fig. 2A). In control cells, the expression levels of TCL/TC10βL and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were not affected by the addition of IPTG. Using these transformants, we performed a differentiation experiment. The isolated clones were brought to confluence in 10% calf serum containing G418 and hygromycin. After 2 days incubation, the medium was changed to the differentiated medium with or without IPTG. After 8 days, the cells were stained with Oil Red O to detect oil droplets. The control cells stored the oil droplets well regardless of the presence of IPTG. On the other hand, the accumulation of oil droplets in the cells expressing antisense TCL/TC10βL was clearly inhibited by the addition of IPTG (Fig. 2B). To test whether the stage of adipogenesis was really blocked by the expression of antisense TCL/TC10βL, we next determined the expression levels of the fat differentiation-linked genes. The expression of PPARγ, SREBP-1, and C/EBPα, which are all known to be master regulators of adipogenesis, was inhibited to a certain extent (Fig.2C). Lipoprotein lipase, an adipogenic marker, was also inhibited during the differentiation, whereas the expression of C/EBPβ was decreased only slightly, and that of C/EBPδ was unchanged (Fig. 2C). We next generated stable transformants constitutively expressing sense TCL/TC10βL using a retrovirus system. The full-length sense TCL/TC10βL was cloned into a retroviral vector, pDON-AI. NIH-3T3 cells were infected with viruses containing pDONAI-TCL/TC10βL (TCL/TC10βL) or empty vector alone (control), which were produced in PT67 cells. After selection using G418, the drug-resistant clones were isolated. The Northern blot analysis showed that the endogenous TCL/TC10βL (∼3.5 kb) was rarely detected in TCL/TC10βL and control cells, whereas the exogenous TCL/TC10βL derived from retrovirus was found as a ∼4.6-kb long mRNA (Fig. 3A). Then, using these established cell lines, a differentiation experiment was performed. The TCL/TC10βL and control cells were cultured to confluence and treated with IBMX, Dex, Ins, and 10% FBS. Under the conditions, no morphological change or accumulation of oil droplets was observed after 10 days in either of the cells (data not shown). However, it is of interest that TCL/TC10βL cells started to differentiate into adipocytes when 0.5 mm BRL49653, a PPARγ ligand, was added to the differentiation medium. As shown in Fig. 3B, the oil droplets were detected in TCL/TC10βL cells, whereas neither morphological change nor the accumulation of oil droplets was observed in control cells (Fig. 3B). Northern blot analyses were performed to characterize further the phenotype of the TCL/TC10βL cells during the incubation with inducers. Total RNAs were prepared from TCL/TC10βL and control cells at various times after the treatment with differentiation medium containing 0.5 mm BRL49653. The expression of PPARγ and SREBP-1, which are master transcription factors for adipogenesis, was elevated in TCL/TC10βL cells during incubation (Fig. 3C). The expression of aP2 and lipoprotein lipase was also increased, although these increases were slight in control cells. However, the expression levels of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ were unchanged in both TCL/TC10βL and control cells. The expression of C/EBPα was almost undetectable throughout the incubation in both cells. These results strongly suggest that TCL/TC10βL has important functions in the promotion of adipogenesis. The sense and antisense experiments indicated that TCL/TC10βL has critical roles in the early stage of adipocyte differentiation. Because the TCL/TC10βL gene has been reported only recently (17Vignal E. De Toledo M. Comunale F. Ladopoulou A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Blangy A. Fort P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36457-36464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Chiang S.H. Hou J.C. Hwang J. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13067-13073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the functions of its product are not well understood yet, and the signaling network through TCL/TC10βL in adipogenesis has not been characterized at all. To solve this issue, we next isolated the genes that seem to be downstream targets of TCL/TC10βL, by subtraction between TCL/TC10βL and control cells. We designed two different conditions for the characterization of TCL/TC10βL in the differentiation of adipocytes. First, we performed PCR subtraction and isolated the genes in which levels are increased by the expression of ectopic TCL/TC10βL, without the inducers described under “Experimental Procedures” (condition 1). Second, the induced genes were cloned from cells incubated with PPARγ ligand in addition to the inducers for 2 days (condition 2). After performing the PCR subtraction protocol, we chose 300 colonies in each condition and sequenced them. As a result, 231 and 234 independent clones were isolated in conditions 1 and 2, respectively. It seems that 56 clones in conditions 1 and 58 clones in condition 2 are unknown genes as determined from a data base search. Next, we chose 60 and 43 clones, respectively, from known genes in each condition and performed Northern blot analyses by using total RNA prepared from TCL/TC10βL and control cells at 0 day (condition 1) and 2 days after treatment with inducers (condition 2). Finally, we identified 21 and 13 genes, the expression of which was enhanced by TCL/TC10βL in conditions 1 and 2, respectively. These genes are listed in TableI.Table IUp-regulated genes in the TCL/TC10βL-expressing stable transformantCondition 1 Signaling proteinsPleiotrophinProtein phosphatase 2A, regulator subunit APKC binding protein SSeCKSRhoEAdipocyte serine proteaseLow density lipoprotein-related protein 6Ras p21 protein activator 3Cyclin ITranslocation protein 1 (human) Cytoskeletal and extracellular structureMyosin, heavy polypeptide 9 (Myh9) (rat)Caveolin-1 βLipocortin 1Cytoplasmic γ-actinProcollagen α type I Other genesUp-regulated by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3CalumeninCellular nucleic acid binding protein (Cnbp)Tissue plasminogen activatorSarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2b)Similar to DnaJ C5GelsolinCondition 2 Transcriptional factorp300/CBP-associated factor (Pcaf) Signaling proteinsRAB7Cellular thyroid hormone binding protein p55 (CTHBP) Cytoskeletal and extracellular structureFat 1 cadherinIntegrin β subunit Other genesLactate dehydrogenase 1, A-chain (Ldh1)Proteasome β type 126S proteasome p112 (Rat)Aldolase 1ATranslation initiation factor 3, subunit 9 (human)Fatty acid transport protein 4Cleft lip and palate associated transmembrane protein 1 (Clptm1)Heat shock protein 84The PCR subtraction was performed under two different conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The nucleotide sequences of isolated clones were searched in the DNA data bases, and the names were shown when identical to mouse clones.

When the clones showed high similarity to other species, the name of the source is given in parentheses. As expected, the isolated genes include the ones contributing to the signal transduction and cytoskeletal and extracellular structures. Northern blot analyses were performed for some genes during the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, the expression patterns of several genes were found to be similar, or slightly delayed, compared with the expression of TCL/TC10βL. The differentiation of adipocytes is a very complex process. The expression patterns and the functions of several transcription factors have been well characterized. Experiments using knockout mice for PPARγ showed the requirement of this gene for the differentiation into adipocytes (25Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K. Satoh S. Nakano R. Ishii C. Sugiyama T. Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Okuno A. Murakami K. Sekihara H. Hasegawa G. Naito M. Toyoshima Y. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Kitamura T. Fujita T. Ezaki O. Aizawa S. Nagai R. Tobe K.

The double knockout of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ impaired the synthesis of fat in mice (27Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7432-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is reported that the ectopic expression of C/EBPα promotes adipogenesis as well as PPARγ (28Lin F.-T. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8757-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The dominant negative form of SREBP-1 prevented adipocyte differentiation (13Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggested that these three transcription factor families have indispensable roles in adipocyte differentiation. Thus, even though the middle and late stages of adipocyte differentiation have been relatively well characterized, the events in the early stage of adipogenesis have not been fully elucidated. Previously we isolated many genes induced early in adipocyte differentiation (15Imagawa M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Nishizuka M. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The present paper describes the functional role of TCL/TC10βL. The pattern of TCL/TC10βL expression during adipocyte differentiation was specific and different from that of other Rho family members such as RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Interestingly, although TCL/TC10βL shares high similarity to TC10α, the expression pattern of the TC10α gene was also different. TCL/TC10βL was expressed at the beginning of adipogenesis, whereas the expression of TC10α peaked late in the differentiation. It is also reported that TC10α and TCL/TC10βL differ in their impact on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (18Chiang S.H. Hou J.C. Hwang J. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13067-13073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These results indicated that TCL/TC10βL and TC10α have quite different functions in adipocyte differentiation and adipose tissue. Saltiel's group (18Chiang S.H. Hou J.C. Hwang J. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13067-13073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) also reported that there were two isoforms, TC10β and TC10βL. In our experiments, only the longer form, TC10βL, was detected at the early stage of differentiation, which suggests different roles for the isoforms, although further characterization is definitely needed. When NIH-3T3 cells expressing TCL/TC10βL differentiated into adipocytes, the PPARγ ligand was required. In our previous paper, we demonstrated that the regulator of G-protein signaling 2 (RGS2) promoted the differentiation in the presence of ligand for PPARγ (29Nishizuka M. Kohei H. Tsuchiya T. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29625-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this case, the expression patterns of adipogenic genes were quite similar to those of TCL/TC10βL; that is, the expression of PPARγ, but not C/EBPs, was observed. Rosen et al. (30Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar) recently showed that C/EBPα induces adipogenesis through PPARγ and has no ability to promote adipocyte differentiation in the absence of PPARγ, strongly indicating that the adipocytes developed through PPARγ as a unified pathway and that PPARγ seems to be the proximal effector of adipogenesis. It is likely that both TCL/TC10βL and RGS2 are involved in this PPARγ-linked signaling pathway, and this is one reason that neither gene has an effect on the expression of C/EBPs. Sakaue et al. (31Sakaue H. Konishi M. Ogawa W. Asaki T. Mori T. Yamasaki M. Takata M. Ueno H. Kato S. Kasuga M. Itoh N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) reported the requirement of fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) in the development of white adipose tissue. By experiments using anti-FGF10, and also FGF10 knockout mice and embryonic fibroblasts, they showed that FGF10 contributes to the expression of C/EBPβ through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism. Therefore, it seems that this signaling pathway may be different from the TCL/TC10βL and/or RGS2 pathway, although it is finally linked to a unified pathway through PPARγ. The functional role of PPARγ ligand in the adipogenesis of TCL/TC10βL-expressing NIH-3T3 cells remains to be investigated. There are at least two possibilities. One is that the endogenous PPARγ, activated by the added ligand, enhances the functions of TCL/TC10βL and RGS2 and also activates the PPARγ pathway. The other possibility is that the ligand BRL49653 binds and activates different receptor proteins. There is no direct evidence of a relationship between the signaling pathways through TCL/TC10βL and RGS2 at this moment. Therefore, we newly isolated the genes induced to expression by TCL/TC10βL, and found that the expression patterns of several were similar to that of TCL/TC10βL. It is not clear that these genes are the real targets of TCL/TC10βL signaling, because we do not have any experimental evidences as to their potential function in relation to TCL/TC10βL. Especially, we have no information on the relationship between the Rho GTPase activity of TCL/TC10βL and these isolated genes. However, it is of interest that Ras p21 protein activator 3 was identified as a GTPase-activating protein modulating Ras activity during normal brain development (32Baba H. Fuss B. Urano J. Poullet P. Watson J.B. Tamanoi F. Macklin W.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 15: 846-858Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A cellular nucleic acid-binding protein (Cnbp) is a zinc finger DNA-binding protein (33Warden C.H. Krisans S.K. Purcell-Huynh D. Leete L.M. Daluiski A. Diep A. Taylor B.A. Lusis A.J. Genomics. 1994; 24: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and a cellular thyroid hormone-binding protein (CTHBP) is known to be involved in insulin action (34Lee Y.-H. Harada S. Smith R.M. Friedman R. Jarett L. Biochem., Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The further characterization of these genes would help us to understand the signaling pathway at the early stage of adipocyte differentiation. The relationship between TCL/TC10βL activity (Rho GTPase activity) and the early stage of adipocyte differentiation is also still unclear. Further studies, including experiments using constitutively active and/or dominant negative mutants of TCL, and also transient inhibition at the various time points using the RNA interference method, are definitely needed to determine whether TCL/TC10βL has a crucial role during the early stage of adipogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2091683011,"Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is activated in response to various environmental stresses including viral infection and DNA-damaging agents. However, the biological function of IRF3 in cell growth is not well understood. We demonstrated that IRF3 markedly inhibited growth and colony formation of cells. IRF3 blocked DNA synthesis and induced apoptosis. Based on this negative control of cell growth by IRF3, we examined whether functional loss of IRF3 may contribute to oncogenic transformation. IRF3 activity was specifically inhibited by expression of its dominant negative mutant. This mutant lacks a portion of the DNA binding domain like IRF3a, an alternative splice form of IRF3 in the cells. This dominant negative inhibition blocked expression of specific IRF3 target genes. Mutant IRF3 efficiently transformed NIH3T3 cells, as demonstrated by anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and tumorigenicity in nude mice. These results imply that IRF3 may function as a tumor suppressor and suggest a possible role for the relative levels of IRF3 and its dominant negative mutant in tumorigenesis. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is activated in response to various environmental stresses including viral infection and DNA-damaging agents. However, the biological function of IRF3 in cell growth is not well understood. We demonstrated that IRF3 markedly inhibited growth and colony formation of cells. IRF3 blocked DNA synthesis and induced apoptosis. Based on this negative control of cell growth by IRF3, we examined whether functional loss of IRF3 may contribute to oncogenic transformation.

Disruption of this negative regulation can clearly contribute to the multistep process of tumorigenesis, as evidenced by the frequent mutation of tumor suppressor genes in human cancer (reviewed in Ref. 1Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2711) Google Scholar). The p53 tumor suppressor gene is frequently mutated or functionally inactivated in human cancers of many different tissue types. The mechanisms by which p53 loss contributes to tumorigenesis have been substantiated by extensive studies of p53 function (2Wahl G.M. Carr A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 3Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5822) Google Scholar, 4Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). For example, p53 plays a role in cell cycle checkpoint control by inducing cell growth arrest in response to DNA damage. Consistent with this function, cells lacking p53 fail to arrest in the cell cycle following DNA damage, which may lead to genetic instability. Thus, as a checkpoint regulator, p53 can directly and indirectly suppress tumor induction by preventing the propagation of oncogenic mutations in other genes. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)1 is known to be induced by viral infection (reviewed in Ref. 5Maniatis T. Falvo J.V. Kim T.H. Kim T.K. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Wathelet M.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We found that IRF3, like p53, can also be induced by DNA-damaging agents including doxorubicin (6Kim T. Kim T.Y. Song Y.-H. Min I.M. Yim J. Kim T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30686-30689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 7Kim T.K. Kim T. Kim T.Y. Lee W.G. Yim J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1153-1156PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kim T. Kim T.Y. Lee W.G. Yim J. Kim T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16910-16917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, Weaver et al. (9Weaver B.K. Ando O. Kumar K.P. Reich N.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have show that the DNA-damaging agent, etoposide, activates IRF3 and induces specific target genes including ISG54 in the absence of the action of interferon. Interestingly, Karpova et al. (10Karpova A.Y. Trost M. Murray J.M. Cantley L.C. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2818-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) demonstrate that IRF3 is an in vivo target of DNA-dependent protein kinase, which is involved in cell cycle checkpoint control in response to DNA damage. A similar regulatory mechanism was described for p53; DNA damage induced phosphorylation of Ser-15 in p53, and this serine site is the known target for the DNA-dependent protein kinase family of kinases (2Wahl G.M. Carr A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 3Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5822) Google Scholar, 4Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Furthermore, virus-inducible double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR, may be involved in the DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of p53 through regulating the activity of the DNA-PK family of kinases (11Cuddihy A.R. Li S. Tam N.W. Wong A.H. Taya Y. Abraham N. Bell J.C. Koromilas A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These results, together with possible cross-talk between DNA damage and other stress response pathways, suggest that IRF3, like p53, may play a role in a variety of host defenses that have evolved to counter environmental stresses. An interesting possibility emerging from these studies is that IRF3 can directly control cell growth and the functional loss of IRF3 may contribute to oncogenic transformation. In an effort to test this possibility and to determine the physiological function of IRF3, we induced IRF3 activity with its ectopic overexpression, and we inhibited IRF3 activity using a dominant negative mutant that contains a defective DNA binding domain like IRF3a, an alternative splice form of IRF3 in the cells (12Karpova A.Y. Howley P.M. Ronco L.V. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2813-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Karpova A.Y. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4169-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These studies revealed the anti-oncogenic and oncogenic potentials of IRF3 and a dominant negative IRF3 mutant. Human IRF3 was expressed under the control of the constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter in pcDNA3 (Amersham Biosciences). A deletion mutant for IRF3 lacking the DNA binding domain (IRF3Δ) was made by PCR amplification of the region encoding amino acid residues 58–427. This fragment of IRF3 (IRF3Δ) and an oncogenic version of Ha-ras(Ha-ras G12V) (14Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3778) Google Scholar) were also cloned into pcDNA3 (Amersham Biosciences). The plasmid used as a negative control was an empty plasmid, pcDNA3, containing no corresponding gene in each experiment. To generate anti-human IRF3 antibody, recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IRF3 was expressed inEscherichia coli, purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), and then used to immunize rabbits. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing fetal bovine serum or calf serum. All of the cell growth media contained 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells (typically 0.5–1 × 106; otherwise as indicated in the figure legends) were transfected with specific amounts of plasmids as indicated in the figure legends, using LipofectAMINE reagents (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency was analyzed by cotransfection with pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) followed by monitoring under a fluorescence microscope. To select transiently transfected cells, we utilized the Capture-Tec kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were cotransfected with either control or IRF3 expression plasmids and phOx SFV expression plasmid (pHook-1, Invitrogen). Transfected cells were then selected through incubation with magnetic beads coated with hapten for 1 h as suggested (Invitrogen). Cells (0.5–1 × 106) were cotransfected with either control or IRF3 (and IRF3Δ) expression plasmids and GFP expression plasmid (pEGFP-N1, Clontech). After transfection, the number of GFP-expressing cells was monitored for 5 days under fluorescent microscopy. Cell division was observed as an increase in the number of aggregates of GFP-expressing cells. For stable colony formation assays, cells (1 × 106) were transfected with plasmids containing the neomycin resistance gene. At 24 h post-transfection, G418 (1 mg/ml) was added to the transfected cells and cells were cultured for 2 weeks. The plates were then stained with crystal violet in 20% ethanol, and colonies containing more than 30 cells were counted from representative fields. DNA synthesis assay was performed with the 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling and detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated with BrdUrd for 24 h. After the labeling medium was removed, the cells were fixed and the DNA was denatured by adding FixDenat (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Then, anti-BrdUrd-POD antibody is added and BrdUrd incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA was detected by a substrate reaction (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The DNA synthesis rate was quantified with a microplate reader (EG&G Wallac). For fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The harvested cells were fixed with 70% ethanol for 1 h on ice. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation with RNase (1 mg/ml), the DNA in fixed cells was stained with propidium iodide (10 mg/ml) for 30 min. Cells were analyzed by FACSCaliber (BD Biosciences). Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysis in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors. Following the centrifugation, proteins in the extracts were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and probed with anti-human IRF3 antibody. Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Cells were incubated with IFN-β (1000 units/ml) or Sendai virus (200 hemagglutinin unit/ml) as described previously (6Kim T. Kim T.Y. Song Y.-H. Min I.M. Yim J. Kim T.K. J. Biol.

Total RNA was prepared from cells treated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). For each sample, 5 μg of isolated RNA was used for the reverse transcriptase reaction with the SuperScript System (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The resultant cDNA was used for PCR with primers specific for IFN-β, 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (2′,5′-AS), and GBP-1 as described previously (15Fujita T. Reis L.F. Watanabe N. Kimura Y. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9936-9940Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Amplification was carried out for 28 cycles, and 5 μl of the resulting reaction mixtures were separated and analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. Soft agar assays in 6-cm dishes were performed as previously described (16Galaktionov K. Lee A.K. Eckstein J. Draetta G. Meckler J. Loda M. Beach D. Science. 1995; 269: 1575-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Cells (1, 3, and 5 × 105) were seeded in 0.3% agarose solution in DMEM containing 10% calf serum over a cushion of 0.5% agarose solution also in DMEM growth medium. Cells were fed with fresh DMEM growth medium containing 0.3% agarose every week. After 3 weeks, plates were checked and photographed. Tumorigenicity assays were performed as described previously (16Galaktionov K. Lee A.K. Eckstein J. Draetta G. Meckler J. Loda M. Beach D. Science. 1995; 269: 1575-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Nude mice (BALB/cnu/nu) were injected subcutaneously with 1 × 106 cells resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Injected mice were observed every 3 days. Subcutaneous tumors were grossly visible at the site of injection after 2–3 weeks. Each cell line was tested for tumorigenicity in 3–12 different mice. To examine the function of IRF3 in cell growth, we analyzed the effect of its overexpression on cell growth (Fig.1). To this end, HeLa cells were transfected with the IRF3 expression plasmid, together with the GFP expression plasmid as a marker of transfection. Using GFP, we were able to examine the division of live cells over time as evidenced by the increasing number of GFP-expressing cell aggregates. Examination by fluorescence microscopy for 5 days following transfection showed that IRF3-transfected cells failed to divide, whereas control-transfected cells continued to divide (Fig. 1A). In control-transfected cells, we found increased numbers of GFP-expressing cell aggregates over time, whereas only a few cells expressing GFP were observed in IRF3-transfected cells (Fig. 1B). We also used a colony formation assay to evaluate the growth-inhibitory effect of IRF3 (Fig. 2). HeLa cells were transfected with the IRF3 expression plasmid with a neomycin resistance gene. After transfection, G418 was added and transfected cells were selected for 2 weeks. Ectopic expression of IRF3 markedly inhibited stable colony formation in HeLa cells (Fig. 2A). IRF3 inhibited by nearly 90% of the stable clones as compared with control-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the average size of the colonies was much smaller when transfected with the expression plasmid for IRF3 (data not shown). Taken together with data from Fig. 1, these results indicate that IRF3 inhibits cell division and stable colony formation in HeLa cells. Next, we tried to gain insight into the mechanisms for the observed cell growth inhibition by IRF3. Ectopic expression of IRF3 induced chromatin condensation and fragmentation of the nucleus in a small percentage of transfected cells stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (data not shown). To test the significance of this observation, transfected cells were verified by cotransfection with GFP expression plasmids, and then cell survival was assayed by a trypan blue exclusion assay. Consistently, we detected a small decrease in the number of live cells upon expression of IRF3 (Fig. 3A). Thus, apoptosis is probably not the major cause for the observed growth-inhibitory effect of IRF3 under our conditions. Based on these results, we examined whether the IRF3-mediated growth inhibition was also due to a block in DNA synthesis (Fig. 3B). DNA synthesis was monitored by measuring BrdUrd incorporated into newly synthesized DNA. Ectopic expression of IRF3 dramatically reduced BrdUrd incorporation into DNA (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that IRF3 can inhibit cell growth by blocking DNA synthesis and, to some extent, inducing apoptosis. To further examine the basis for IRF3-mediated cell growth inhibition, we analyzed the cell cycle progression upon the ectopic expression of IRF3 (Fig. 4). To this end, HeLa cells were transfected with the IRF3 expression plasmid, together with the phOx SFV expression plasmid as a marker of transfection. Transfected cells were stained with propidium iodide for FACS analysis. Western blot analysis showed the induction of IRF3 protein levels in the transfected cells (Fig. 4A). Under these conditions, IRF3 significantly increased the number of G1 cells, reducing that of cells in the S-phase (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3A, we detected no such marked increase in the number of apoptotic cells upon expression of IRF3. These results further support the conclusion from our results shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 that IRF3 plays a negative role in cell division and growth. HeLa cells were utilized in various cell growth assays with IRF3 (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Next, we determined the inhibitory role of IRF3 in cell growth using other cell types (HepG2, NIH3T3, and REF52) (Fig.5). These different types of cells were transfected with the IRF3 expression plasmid, together with the GFP expression plasmid as a marker of transfection. The cell growth was monitored by the increasing number of GFP-expressing cells under the fluorescence microscopy for 5 days after transfection. As in HeLa cells, IRF3-transfected cells failed to divide in all of the tested cells, whereas control-transfected cells continued to divide (Fig. 5,A (HepG2), B (NIH3T3), and C (REF52)). The slight decrease in the number of IRF3-transfected HeLa (Fig.1A), HepG2, and NIH3T3 (Fig. 5, A andB) cells may support the significance of IRF3-dependent apoptotic response demonstrated in Fig.3A (9Weaver B.K. Ando O. Kumar K.P. Reich N.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Heylbroeck C. Balachandranm S. Servant M.J. DeLuca C. Barber G.N. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3781-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, IRF3 can inhibit cell growth in various kinds of cells. Based on the function of IRF3 in negative control of cell growth, we next examined how the loss of IRF3 activity affects on cell growth. To this end, we attempted to utilize mutant IRF3Δ lacking a portion of the DNA binding domain at its amino terminus like IRF3a, which is an alternative splice isoform of IRF3 in the cells (12Karpova A.Y. Howley P.M. Ronco L.V. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2813-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Karpova A.Y. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4169-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As a first step, we examined the possible dominant negative effects of IRF3Δ on the observed IRF3-induced attenuation of cell growth (Fig.6). The cell growth was monitored by the increasing number of GFP-expressing cells under fluorescence microscopy for 5 days after cotransfection with IRF3 and IRF3Δ expression plasmids. Consistent with our results (Figs. 1 and 5), IRF3 markedly attenuated the cell growth of NIH3T3 and HeLa. This attenuation was significantly inhibited by coexpression of IRF3Δ (Fig. 6). These results suggest that IRF3Δ can be functional as a dominant negative mutant of IRF3 in the cell growth. To further examine the function of dominant negative mutant of IRF3 in cell growth, we generated NIH3T3 cell clones overexpressing IRF3Δ. The plasmid pcDNA3, which expresses the human IRF3 protein (58–427 amino acid residues) without its DNA binding domain under the control of the constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter, was transfected into NIH3T3 cells. As a positive control, some cells were transfected with an expression plasmid for an oncogenic version of Ha-ras(Ha-ras G12V) in which glycine at amino acid position 12 was changed to valine (14Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3778) Google Scholar). A control expression plasmid, pcDNA3, was transfected into NIH3T3 cells as a negative control. After selection for G418 resistance, we obtained several clones that expressed some levels of truncated human IRF3 protein. One such clone (2Wahl G.M. Carr A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) was chosen for initial experiments because of its high level of expression (Fig. 7A). To address the specific effect of the IRF3 mutant, we assayed the induction of three endogenous genes having promoters that contain IRF binding sites: IFN-β, 2′,5′-AS, and GBP-1 (Fig. 7B). These promoters are activated by viral infection through specific activation of IRF3 (18Juang Y. Lowther W. Kellum M. Au W.C. Lin R. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). IFN treatment also induces certain promoters but fails to stimulate transcriptional activity of IRF3; thus, IFN may induce the promoters through activation of the other IRF family factors (e.g. IRF1 and ISGF3) (26Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3383) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a dominant negative IRF3 mutant (IRF3Δ) sharply reduced viral induction of three tested genes including IFN-β (Fig. 7B). In contrast, overexpression of IRF3Δ did not affect induction of the 2′,5′-AS and GBP-1 genes in response to IFN treatment. Furthermore, under these conditions, expression of a control gene, GAPDH(glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), was not affected by expression of IRF3Δ. These results strongly suggest that expression of IRF3Δ inhibits endogenous genes that are specifically regulated by IRF3 but not those regulated by other IRF family factors. The demonstrated role of IRF3 in cell growth inhibition raised the possibility that its inactivation might play a role in oncogenic transformation in a manner analogous to mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. NIH3T3 cells are highly susceptible to oncogenic transformation by inactivation of p53 or activation of Ha-ras. Indeed, microscopic examination of the cells expressing Ha-ras G12V revealed multilayer growth typical of transformed cells (Fig. 8A). Similar morphological changes were observed with expression of IRF3Δ. To assess their oncogenic potential, clones overexpressing IRF3Δ and Ha-ras G12V were tested for colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 8B). Anchorage-independent growth in soft agar often correlates with malignant transformation. At 3 weeks, we detected the formation of tight colonies in soft agar with expression of both IRF3Δ and Ha-ras G12V. In contrast, control-transfected control cells showed almost no colony formation under these conditions. Thus, cells overexpressing a dominant negative IRF3 mutant (IRF3Δ) display anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. Furthermore, whole populations of cells transfected with IRF3Δ were plated directly into soft agar, and the results confirmed the ability of IRF3Δ to form colonies (Fig. 8C). To further confirm the tumorigenic potential of cells expressing IRF3Δ, we injected these cells and cells expressing Ha-rasG12V subcutaneously into nude mice (Fig. 8D). In all mice injected with cells overexpressing IRF3Δ or Ha-ras G12V, tumors developed within 2 to 3 weeks and continued to grow unrestrictedly (12 mice for IRF3Δ and 3 mice for Ha-rasG12V). No tumors developed in nude mice injected with cells from control-transfected control cells during the same period of time. These results suggest that the expression of a dominant negative IRF3 mutant (IRF3Δ) imposes altered growth properties and tumorigenicity in NIH3T3 cells. Finally, we analyzed the tumorigenic potentials of several other clones expressing some levels of truncated IRF3 protein (Fig.9). Selected clones (4, 5, and 7) showed less amounts of truncated IRF3 mutant protein (IRF3Δ) than the clone (2Wahl G.M. Carr A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) used for the experiments in Figs. 7 and 8 (Fig. 9A). Under these conditions, all of these clones facilitated tight colony formations in soft agar (Fig. 9B). Furthermore, tumors were developed within 2–3 weeks in all the mice injected with cells expressing IRF3Δ mutant protein (Fig. 9C). Alterations in growth properties were observed consistently in all of the tested clones with expression of a dominant negative IRF3 mutant (IRFΔ), and therefore transformed phenotypes were not the result of clonal variations. Our present studies have demonstrated the tumor suppressor function of IRF3 and the oncogenic potential of a dominant negative IRF3 mutant that specifically inhibits the expression of IRF3 target genes. Ectopic expression of IRF3 markedly attenuated cell growth in various kinds of cells including HeLa, HepG2, REF52, and NIH3T3 cells. Expression of the IRF3 mutant (IRF3Δ) facilitated oncogenic transformation in NIH3T3 cells, and its tumorigenic potential was clearly demonstrated by anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice. Impaired IRF3 may be responsible for the observed transformation, because IRF3Δ inhibited expression of specific IRF3 target genes (Fig. 7) and ectopic expression of IRF3 suppressed the colony formation by IRF3Δ in NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). The physiological relevance of a dominant negative IRF3 mutant (IRF3Δ) can be supported by the identification of IRF3a in the cells (10Karpova A.Y. Trost M. Murray J.M. Cantley L.C. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2818-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12Karpova A.Y. Howley P.M. Ronco L.V. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2813-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Karpova A.Y. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4169-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). IRF3a is generated by alternative splicing of IRF3 pre-mRNA. As demonstrated with IRF3Δ, IRF3a can selectively and potently inhibit virus-induced activation of specific target genes including IFN-β and it contains defective DNA binding domain. The expression of IRF3a is ubiquitous, but the levels of IRF3a, compared with those of IRF3, can vary in different cellular contexts. Such regulated production of the IRF3a protein would result in the controlled inhibition of IRF3 activity at the specific target promoters. Because the present studies indicate the role of IRF3 in the cell growth control, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms showing how the ratio of IRF3a to IRF3 is maintained and controlled in response to various signals and that the ratio can be deregulated to alter cell growth control during tumorigenesis. The ability of an IRF3 mutant to transform cells was nearly as great as that of the oncogenic Ha-ras G12V. Furthermore, mutational inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene can also facilitate oncogenic transformation under similar conditions (27Jenkins J.R. Rudge K. Currie G.A.

One interesting possibility emerging from the present studies is that expression of mutant IRF3 protein may confer tumorigenic phenotype upon the cells, similar to the gain-of-function associated with p53 mutants (31Oijen M. Slootweg P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 2138-2145PubMed Google Scholar). The p53 mutant loses its tumor suppressor function as a consequence of the functional inactivation of p53. However, certain types of p53 mutations exert additional gain-of-function phenotypes with dominant negative effects on wild type p53. The mechanisms for these gain-of-function of p53 mutants have not been well characterized. The relevance of these mechanisms remains to be determined in IRF3, with further elucidation of how tumorigenesis may be enhanced by IRF3Δ. It is well known that most spontaneously immortalized rodent cells such as NIH3T3 cells can be transformed efficiently by activation of one oncogene (or inactivation of one tumor suppressor gene) alone, in contrast to primary rodent and human cells. Interestingly, NIH3T3 cells were shown to contain the deleted p16 tumor suppressor gene, which plays a critical role in Rb regulation pathways (32Linardopoulos S. Street A. Quelle D.E. Parry D. Peters G. Sherr C.J. Balmain A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5168-5172PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, inactivation of IRF3 might cooperate with other oncogenic events for tumorigenesis in normal cells. To understand these tumorigenesis mechanisms (including gain-of-function effects), it is critical to determine which genes play a role in the inhibition and promotion of cell growth with up- and down-regulation of IRF3, respectively. Related to this concern, the profiling of genome activities is in progress with conditional expression of IRF3 and IRF3Δ using DNA microarray methods. Another member of the IRF family, IRF2, blocks the activation of promoters containing IRF binding sites. When IRF2 was overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells, the cells became transformed and displayed enhanced tumorigenicity in nude mice (33Harada H. Kitagawa M. Tanaka N. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Ishihara M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1993; 259: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Consistently, overexpression of IRF2 impaired the activation of genes that are controlled by IRF family factors (e.g. IRF1 and ISGF3). Based on our results, we infer that the ability of IRF2, like an IRF3 mutant, to induce cell transformation might also be due to suppression of the transcriptional activity of IRF3. Indeed, ectopic expression of IRF2 can inhibit IRF3-dependent transcriptional activation (data not shown). Thus, several IRF family members including IRF3a might interact functionally to tightly modulate cell growth, and alterations in their regulation could contribute to oncogenic transformation. Thus far, the involvement of IRF3 in human cancer has not been studied extensively, and no mutation in the IRF3 gene has been reported in a human cancer. However, several viral oncoproteins, including human papillomavirus 16 E6 and adenovirus E1A, can inhibit the activation of IRF3 as well as p53 (18Juang Y. Lowther W. Kellum M. Au W.C. Lin R.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2061-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The v-IRF protein from Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus is shown to inhibit IRF3 transcriptional activity by blocking the interaction of CBP (CREB-binding protein)/p300 coactivator with IRF3 (35Lin R. Genin P. Mamane Y. Sgarbanti M. Battistini A. Harrington Jr., W.J. Barber G.N. Hiscott J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 800-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). On the basis of the present studies, the interaction of these oncoproteins with IRF3 and the inhibition of its transcriptional activation function could contribute directly to the oncogenic potential of these viruses by altering cell growth control pathways. Quite interestingly, and consistent with our idea of the tumor suppressing function of IRF3, ectopic expression of IRF3 has recently been found to suppress the growth of B16 melanoma tumors in the context of gene therapy (36Duguay D. Mercier F. Stagg J. Martineau D. Bramson J. Servant M. Lin R. Galipeau J. Hoscott J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5148-5152PubMed Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2084401359,"The p53 family includes three members that share significant sequence homology, yet exhibit fundamentally different functions in tumorigenesis. Whereas p53 displays all characteristics of a classical tumor suppressor, its homologues p63 and p73 do not. We have previously shown, that NH2-terminally truncated isoforms of p73 (ΔTA-p73), which act as dominant-negative inhibitors of p53 are frequently overexpressed in cancer cells. Here we provide evidence that ΔTA-p73 isoforms also affect the retinoblastoma protein (RB) tumor suppressor pathway independent of p53. ΔTA-p73 isoforms inactivate RB by increased phosphorylation, resulting in enhanced E2F activity and proliferation of fibroblasts. By inactivating the two major tumor suppressor pathways in human cells they act functionally analogous to several viral oncoproteins. These findings provide an explanation for the fundamentally different functions of p53 and p73 in tumorigenesis.

These findings provide an explanation for the fundamentally different functions of p53 and p73 in tumorigenesis. The TP53 gene was the first tumor supressor gene to be identified and is still considered to be the prototype tumor suppressor. In more than half of human tumors the TP53 gene is directly inactivated by mutations and in many others, p53 is functionally compromised epigenetically by various mechanisms (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar, 2Sherr C.J. Weber J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In fact, several transforming oncogenes have been shown to be potent inhibitors of p53 (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar). Loss of functional p53 therefore appears to be crucial for the development of most, if not all, cancers. While p53 was long considered to be unique, recently two p53-related genes were discovered (3Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X.

TP73 and TP63 encode proteins with remarkable sequence homology to p53, suggesting that they are also involved in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. Indeed, in experimental systems, p73 showed many p53-like properties: it could bind to p53 DNA binding sites, transactivate p53-responsive genes, and induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (3Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D.

However, apart from structural and functional similarities between p53 and p73, several pieces of evidence argue against p73 being a classical tumor suppressor. In contrast to p53, p73 is not inactivated by classic viral oncoproteins to allow host cell transformation, indicating that p73 may augment, rather than inhibit, viral and cellular transformation (7Marin M.C. Jost C.A. Irwin M.S. DeCaprio J.A. Caput D. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6316-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In contrast to mice lacking p53, p73-negative mice are not prone to tumor development (8Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Despite initial reports suggesting tumor-associated deletion of p73, many subsequent studies failed to demonstrate mutational inactivation of the TP73 gene in a wide variety of tumors (9Melino G.

Instead, overexpression of p73 in its wild-type form has been reported for tumor entities as different as neuroblastomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, lung, prostate, colorectal, gastric, breast, bladder, ovarian, and esophageal cancers (10Stiewe T.

In hepatocellular carcinomas high p73 expression levels were revealed as an independent marker of poor patient survival prognosis (17Tannapfel A. Wasner M. Krause K. Geissler F. Katalinic A. Hauss J.

Considering that p73 overexpression also correlates with poor prognostic parameters in other tumor types and is observed in ∼20–90% of all cancer patients, overexpression likely contributes to the tumorigenic phenotype (9Melino G.

The molecular basis for the apparently different functions of p53 and p73 in human tumors is presently unknown but might be related to the differences in genomic organization of the TP53 andTP73 genes. Whereas TP53 does not show much splice variations, the TP73 gene encodes a complex number of isoforms. We have recently reported that p73 overexpression is accompanied by increased expression levels of NH2-terminally truncated anti-apoptotic isoforms which lack the transactivation domain and are therefore termed ΔTA-p73 (or ΔN-p73) (20Stiewe T. Zimmermann S. Frilling A. Esche H. Putzer B.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3598-3602PubMed Google Scholar). The origin of ΔTA-p73 proteins is still controversially discussed (20Stiewe T. Zimmermann S.

Med. 2002; 196: 765-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Some ΔTA-p73 transcripts are generated by aberrant splicing (p73Δex2, p73Δex2/3, ΔN′-p73), and others are derived from a second intronic promoter (ΔN-p73) (20Stiewe T. Zimmermann S. Frilling A. Esche H. Putzer B.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3598-3602PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that full-length, transactivation-competent p73 (TA-p73) is a proapoptotic protein (6Jost C.A. Marin M.C. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), we focused our further analyses on the possible function of the anti-apoptotic ΔTA-p73 isoforms in tumorigenesis. In fact, ectopic expression of ΔTA-p73 results in malignant transformtion of NIH3T3 cells, suggesting that ΔTA-p73 isoforms play the role of putative oncoproteins (20Stiewe T. Zimmermann S. Frilling A. Esche H. Putzer B.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3598-3602PubMed Google Scholar). Since ΔTA-p73 species lack the NH2-terminal transactivation domain but retain an intact DNA binding domain, they act as transdominant inhibitors of p53-mediated transactivation of specific genes implicated in cell cycle control and apoptosis (21Stiewe T.

However, many primary tumors harbor p53 mutations accompanied by overexpression of p73 (15Zaika A.I. Kovalev S. Marchenko N.D. Moll U.M.

The common clonal expansion of cells that harbor both p53 inactivation and p73 overexpression suggests that the oncogenic properties of ΔTA-p73 extend beyond a dominant-negative effect on p53 function. Here, we report that overexpression of ΔTA-p73 induces proliferation of serum-starved normal human diploid fibroblasts which can be attributed to an increase in the activity of the cell cycle-promoting transcription factor E2F. Further we show, that activation of E2F is accomplished by increased phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (RB) 1The abbreviations used are: RBretinoblastoma proteinNHDFnormal human diploid fibroblastGFPgreen fluorescent protein1The abbreviations used are: RBretinoblastoma proteinNHDFnormal human diploid fibroblastGFPgreen fluorescent protein resulting in a release of active E2F. This proliferative function of ΔTA-p73 provides a possible explanation for the selective advantage of p73-overexpressing cells during human tumorigenesis, suggesting that p73 expression is not simply a consequence of malignant transformation but rather actively contributes to the development of the tumorigenic phenotype. Importantly, this effect of ΔTA-p73 on RB function is independent of its known p53 inhibitory activity and therefore represents a novel function of p73. retinoblastoma protein normal human diploid fibroblast green fluorescent protein retinoblastoma protein normal human diploid fibroblast green fluorescent protein SAOS-2, MCF7, and H1299 cell lines were obtained from the ATCC.

The pGL3-TATA-E2F plasmid used to measure E2F activity was obtained from Ali Fattaey (Onyx Pharmaceuticals) and contains six E2F binding sites in front of a TATA element. In general, 200 ng of this reporter plasmid were used and cotransfected with up to 600 ng of expression plasmids for p73 or p63 isoforms, p53-/p73 inhibitors, E2F1, RB family members, or inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (p21CDKN1A, p16CDKN2A). Luciferase activity was measured 48 h post-transfection using a premanufactured luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and normalized to the total protein concentration in the cell extract. Error bars represent the S.D. between two to three independent transfections. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), and total protein concentration was quantitated by Bradford assay. Samples (100 μg per lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with p73 (ER15, Oncogene Science) or RB antibodies (C-19, Santa Cruz; phospho-specific RB antibodies against serine residues Ser780, Ser795 and Ser807/811 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology). NHDFs were grown on coverslips under serum starvation for 48 h. Infection with recombinant adenoviruses expressing ΔTA-p73β, or GFP was performed at an multiplicity of infection of 100 under serum starvation. Positive control cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal calf serum. 48 h after infection the cells were fixed with ice-cold ethanol:acetic acid and stained with the Ki-67 antibody (BioGenex). A secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 546 (Molecular Probes) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes) were used for visualization with a laser scanning microscope. 1 × 107 SAOS-2 cells were transfected by electroporation with plasmids encoding for RB (3 μg), cyclin E (6 μg), or ΔTA-p73β (6 μg). A puromycin resistance gene pIRESpuro2 (Becton Dickinson, 1 μg) was cotransfected. After 48 h cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin for 10 days. The number of flat cells was determined manually under the microscope. To further investigate the underlying mechanisms of ΔTA-p73 mediated oncogenicity, we analyzed the effects of ΔTA-p73 expression in primary non-transformed cells. Human diploid fibroblasts (NHDFs) that were cultured under conditions of serum starvation for 2 days showed a complete growth arrest. To measure proliferative activity we stained the cells with the Ki-67 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes a nuclear antigen present in proliferating, but not resting cells. To introduce the ΔTA-p73 cDNA into these growth-arrested primary cells, we used adenoviral vectors that are able to transduce resting fibroblasts with an efficiency of close to 100% (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, both exposure of the cells to fetal calf serum as well as infection with an adenoviral vector expressing ΔTA-p73β induced a strong nuclear Ki-67 staining, whereas cells infected with a GFP control virus only showed a slight and predominantly cytoplasmic Ki-67 staining. Thus, expression of ΔTA-p73β is sufficient to promote proliferation of primary cells in the absence of growth factors. Entry of quiescent cells into proliferation is primarily regulated at the G1 to S phase transition. A major regulator of G1/S transition is the RB, which binds to the E2F transcription factor, thereby converting E2F from a transcriptional activator to a transcriptional repressor. Upon transition into late G1, RB becomes hyperphosphorylated (inactivated) through the action of G1cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) preventing RB from binding and inactivating E2F. Using an E2F-regulated luciferase reporter, which contains six E2F binding sites in front of a TATA element, we show that ΔTA-p73α or ΔTA-p73β expression induces a more than 10-fold increase in E2F activity in MCF7 cells (Fig.2A). Previously, ΔTA-p73 has been shown to function as a dominant-negative regulator of p53 (21Stiewe T. Theseling C.C. Putzer B.M. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, possible that ΔTA-p73 induces cell cycle-promoting E2F activity by antagonizing p53-induced expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest such as the Cdk inhibitor p21. We therefore analyzed the effect of ΔTA-p73 expression on E2F acitvity in p53-null H1299 cells. As shown in Fig.2B, both ΔTA-p73α and ΔTA-p73β have a similar stimulatory effect on E2F activity in these cells. In addition, this effect of ΔTA-p73 is not seen with other inhibitors of the p53-family. Neither the p53-specific inhibitor p53DD nor the p73/p63 inhibitor p73DD activated the E2F reporter (Fig. 2C) (39Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Not even the tumor-derived p53 mutant p53-R175H, which acts as a combined inhibitor of p53, p63, and p73, scored positive in this assay (41Marin M.C. Jost C.A. Brooks L.A. Irwin M.S. O'Nions J.

The mechanism of E2F induction by ΔTA-p73, therefore, appears to be distinct from its known dominant-negative activity. As mentioned before, ΔTA-p73 is a heterogeneous class of p73 proteins with different amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences. p73Δex2, p73Δex2/3, and ΔN′-p73 transcripts are generated from the TA-promoter by alternative splicing, whereas the ΔN-p73 transcript is generated from an alternative intronic promoter and therefore under a different transcriptional regulation (20Stiewe T. Zimmermann S. Frilling A. Esche H. Putzer B.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3598-3602PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, the ΔN′-p73 and ΔN-p73 transcripts code for the same ΔN-p73 protein, which contains a unique 13-amino acid epitope encoded by the alternative exon that is not present in the full-length TA-p73 protein. We compared the different NH2-terminal (p73Δ2, p73Δ2/3, ΔN-p73) and COOH-terminal (α, β, γ, and δ) variants (44De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Barcaroli D. Terrinoni A. Falco M. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Levrero M. Melino G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) for induction of the E2F-regulated reporter. All of the different variants of ΔTA-p73 induced E2F activity with ΔTA-p73α being the most active and ΔTA-p73γ being the weakest (Fig. 3,A and B). These data clearly show that the gain of the unique epitope present in the ΔN-p73 isoform is not required for inducing E2F and that changes in the carboxyl-terminal region only serve to modulate this activity. Therefore loss of the amino-terminal transactivation domain is the major determinant of this novel p73 function. Concerning the structural homology within the p53 family, p73 and p63 are more closely related to each other than to p53 (4Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar, 5Osada M. Ohba M. Kawahara C. Ishioka C. Kanamaru R. Katoh I. Ikawa Y. Nimura Y. Nakagawara A. Obinata M. Ikawa S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In addition, p63 and p73 share the characteristic gene structure with two differently regulated promoters and multiple COOH-terminal splice variants. We therefore compared the ΔN-p73α isoform with the corresponding p63 isoform (ΔN-p63α). Surprisingly, only ΔN-p73α is able to activate the E2F reporter (Fig.4), although ΔN-p63α has also been shown to possess oncogenic activity (45Hibi K. Trink B. Patturajan M. Westra W.H.

Activation of E2F activity therefore represents a novel and specific function of p73. Since E2F is regulated by binding to RB, we further investigated whether ΔTA-p73 influences E2F by interfering with RB function. When we ectopically expressed RB in the RB-, p53-, and p73-negative SAOS-2 cell line, we observed one single band after SDS-PAGE. When we coexpressed RB with ΔTA-p73, another more slowly migrating band appeared (Fig.5A). Considering that the electrophoretic mobility of RB is strongly influenced by its phosphorylation state, the faster migrating band most likely represents hypophosphorylated RB as the active E2F-binding form of RB, whereas the retarded band contains extensively hyperphosphorylated RB, which is the inactive form of RB. Similar changes in the electrophoretic mobility of endogenous RB were observed in normal diploid fibroblasts (Fig. 5B). Serum-starved fibroblasts arrested in G1 contain only low levels of hyperphosphorylated (inactive) RB. Infection with adenoviral vectors for p53 or TA-p73β reduces RB phosphorylation even further, so that only hypophosphorylated RB can be detected. In contrast, we observed a pronounced increase in retarded, hyperphosphorylated RB species in ΔTA-p73-expressing NHDFs. Using a panel of phosphorylation-specific RB antibodies, we could detect increased phosphorylation at serine residues Ser780, Ser795, and Ser807/811 (Fig. 5B). When comparing different ΔTA-p73 isoforms, RB hyperphosphorylation was seen with both NH2-terminally truncated p73α and p73β variants (data not shown). The direct link between expression of ΔTA-p73 and hyperphosphorylation of RB is further substantiated by the time course experiment shown in Fig. 5C. When proliferating NHDFs were serum-starved, RB became completely hypophosphorylated within 24 h in the control cells. In cells infected with the Ad vector expressing ΔTA-p73, RB phosphorylation initially declined but started to increase around 24 h. ΔTA-p73 expression could be observed as early as 18 h post-infection therefore preceeding the increase in RB phosphorylation. Since the ability of RB to interact with E2F is regulated by phosphorylation, the data implicate that hyperphosphorylation of RB by ΔTA-p73 is responsible for the observed increase in E2F activity. To test this, we performed additional luciferase reporter assays. Activation of an E2F reporter by E2F1 in RB-negative SAOS-2 cells was completely repressed by coexpression of RB or a non-phosphorylatable RB mutant (PSM-RB) (34Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Repression by wild-type RB could be completely rescued by expression of ΔTA-p73, whereas repression by the RB mutant was only partially rescued (Fig.6A). Therefore hyperphosphorylation of RB is necessary for ΔTA-p73 to completely relieve RB-mediated transcriptional repression and induce E2F activity. The residual activation by ΔTA-p73 seen with the pRB mutant is most likely due to activation of E2F by phosphorylation of the other RB family members, which are present in SAOS-2 cells and partially compensate for the lack of RB. Consistent with this, ΔTA-p73 expression enhanced E2F activity in the absence of RB (Fig.6A) and not only rescued repression by RB but also by p107 and p130 (Fig. 6B). Thus, ΔTA-p73 expression abrogates transcriptional repression mediated by all three RB family members. According to the current model pRB is sequentially phosphorylated at the G1to S phase transition by the action of cyclin d-Cdk4/6 and cyclin E-Cdk2 (47Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Santi A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The cyclin d-Cdk4/6 complex is specifically inhibited by the Cdk inhibitor p16 (CDKN2A), whereas p21 (CDKN1A) is a ubiquitous inhibitor of both cyclin d- and cyclin E-dependent kinases. A specific pharmacological inhibitor of cyclin E-Cdk2 is roscovitine. To investigate which kinases are responsible for phosphorylation of RB in response to ΔTA-p73 expression, we used these inhibitors in luciferase ass"

Here we demonstrate that human ARF (p14ARF) can form homo-oligomers. The stability of the oligomers is favored by oxidizing agents in a reversible fashion and involves all three cysteine residues in p14ARF. Furthermore, the effect of p14ARF in clonogenic assays is moderately but reproducibly increased by the mutation of its cysteine residues. We also observed that altering the amino terminus of p14ARF resulted in the appearance of remarkably stable oligomers. This indicates that the amino terminus of p14ARF interferes with the ability of the protein to form multimeric complexes. These observations suggest that p14ARF activity may be linked to its oligomerization status and sensitive to the redox status of the cell.

These observations suggest that p14ARF activity may be linked to its oligomerization status and sensitive to the redox status of the cell. In normal non-stressed cells p53 has a very short half-life (5–20 min) due to an autoregulatory feedback loop mechanism in which the Mdm2 protein plays a key role (reviewed in Refs. 1Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar and 2Lane D.P. Lain S. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 38-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It has been well established that wild type p53 acts as a transcriptional activator of the Mdm2 gene. In turn, Mdm2, which itself has a brief half-life due its auto-ubiquitination activity, has the ability to interact with p53 and to function as a ubiquitin E3 1The abbreviations used are: E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; IVT, in vitro transcription translation; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer.1The abbreviations used are: E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; IVT, in vitro transcription translation; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. ligase that promotes the conjugation of p53 to ubiquitin (3Fang S.

This conjugation to ubiquitin serves as a tag that effectively targets p53 for degradation by the proteasome. In this way, in normal non-stressed cells, p53 is maintained at low levels, and cells are allowed to proliferate. The ARF tumor suppressor (p14ARF in human, p19ARF in mouse) is encoded by the INK4/ARF locus (6Quelle D.E. Zindy F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 993-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). This small protein has been shown to inhibit degradation of p53 mediated by Mdm2 (7Pomerantz J. SchreiberAgus N. Liegeois N.J. Silverman A. Alland L. Chin L. Potes J. Chen K. Orlow I. Lee H.W. CordonCardo C. DePinho R.A.

Cell. 1998; 92: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). Several models have been proposed to explain this effect of p14ARF. In vitro biochemical studies indicate that p14ARF inhibits the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of Mdm2 (9Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), (10Midgley C.A. Desterro J.M.P. Saville M.K. Howard S. Sparks A. Hay R.T. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2312-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and a decrease in the levels of polyubiquitinated p53 by p14ARF was also shown in vivo (11Xirodimas D. Saville M.K. Edling C. Lane D.P. Laín S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In addition, p14ARF was reported to sequester the p53·Mdm2 complex in discrete subnuclear compartments and to inhibit the nuclear export of the complex, a step suggested to be essential for p53 degradation (12Zhang Y.P. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 579-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). According to Tao and Levine (13Tao W.K. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6937-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) this export step could occur via the nucleolus. Finally, in another study, overexpressed p14ARF was shown to induce the localization of Mdm2 in the nucleolus, which is where ARF is primarily detected (14Rizos H. Darmanian A.P. Mann G.J. Kefford R.F. Oncogene. 2000; 15: 2978-2985Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. BarSagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) and proposed to sequester Mdm2 in this compartment. This would prevent its effects on p53 (15Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. BarSagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Whether this mechanism is entirely responsible for the activation of p53 by p14ARF has been questioned by others (16Llanos S. Clark P.A. Rowe J. Peters G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 17Clark P.A. Llanos S. Peters G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4498-4507Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Korgaonkar C. Zhao L. Modestou M. Quelle D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). p53-independent tumor suppressor effects of ARF have also been described (19Weber J.D.

Beach D.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). ARF expression has been shown to be regulated at the transcriptional level (reviewed in Ref. 21Sherr C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). The expression of the ARF gene is induced by several oncogenic signals such as Myc, E1A, E2F, mutated ras, and v-Abl. ARF expression is inhibited by Twist and Tbx-2 and is actively repressed during development by the Bmi repressor. Additionally, the human ARF promoter can be silenced by methylation or expression of wild type p53 (22Stott F.J. Bates S. James M.C. McConnell B.B. Starborg M. Brookes S. Palmero I. Ryan K. Hara E. Vousden K.H. Peters G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5001-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, there are no reports on the regulation of p14ARF function at the protein level. Here we propose that p14ARF forms homo-oligomers and that these are stabilized by oxidative agents. Interestingly, the amino terminus of p14ARF, which is known to be critical for its function, can modulate the appearance of the oligomeric forms. Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—H1299 and U2OS cells were obtained from the ATCC cultured in RPMI or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and gentamicin at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. 4B2 and 2A10 are mouse monoclonal antibodies against Mdm2 (23Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Human p53 was detected using the mouse monoclonal antibody DO1 (24Stephen C.W. Helminen P. Lane D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 58-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-p14ARF serum (IPI) was a kind gift from Dr. K. Vousden (20Carnero A. Hudson J.D. Price C.M.

The mouse monoclonal antibodies against B23 (nucleophosmin) and the His tag were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. and Novagen, respectively. Proteasome inhibitor MG132 was obtained from Calbiochem, and stock solutions were prepared in Me2SO. Plasmids—Expression from all constructs was under the control of CMV promoter. pCMVhMdm2 and pcDNA3p14ARF were a kind gift from Dr. A. Levine and Dr. K. Vousden, respectively. pcDNA3 β-galactosidase was a kind gift from R. Stad. All pcDNA3p14ARF derivatives were generated by standard site-directed mutagenesis. The vectors for the expression and purification of His-tagged p14ARF are described below. Transfection of Cells—H1299 or U2OS cells were seeded on 10-cm tissue culture plates at a density of 9 × 105 cells per well and transfected using the calcium-phosphate method essentially as described previously (11Xirodimas D. Saville M.K. Edling C. Lane D.P. Laín S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In all experiments, 1 μg of a plasmid encoding the β-galactosidase protein was used as a transfection efficiency control. Equivalent amounts of CMV promoter in the transfections were maintained with the pcDNA3 control vector. The amount of plasmid used in each transfection was topped up to 20 μg with the bacterial plasmid Bluescript. After 36 h cells were harvested in PBS. Cell pellets were washed with PBS and lysed using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) for 15 min after which they were centrifuged for 20 min at 16,000 rpm, and the cell pellet was discarded. The volumes of the samples were adjusted to equivalent protein concentration and Laemmli buffer or Novex loading buffer (with or without 0.1 m DTT) was added. Where indicated, cell pellets were directly lysed in Laemmli buffer or Novex loading buffer supplemented or not with 0.1 m DTT. The quality of the transfections, sample preparation, and Western blot analysis were always monitored by the expression of β-galactosidase. Western Blot Analysis—Samples were separated by denaturing electrophoresis on 4–12% (to detect p53 and Mdm2) or 12% (to detect p14ARF and all other antigens) Novex polyacrylamide gels run with MOPS buffer with or without antioxidant agent. Similar results were obtained using classic Tris-glycine gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose or Immobilon membranes and developed with the relevant primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies as described in (11Xirodimas D. Saville M.K. Edling C. Lane D.P. Laín S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase activity was detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitations—H1299 cells were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3p14ARF or pcDNA3p14ARFC15,100,123A together with 10 μg of pCMVhMdm2. After 36 h cells were lysed in 200 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycolate, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and diluted with 2 volumes of Nonidet P-40 buffer. 10 μg of the indicated antibodies were added and samples were incubated for1hat4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose beads were added, and samples were rotated for another hour at 4 °C. Complexes bound to the beads were washed six times with Nonidet P-40 buffer in the presence of 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and samples were resuspended and heated in Novex loading buffer with or without 0.1 m DTT. p14ARF was analyzed by Western blotting. Preparation of Nucleoli—The protocol used was adapted from the one described previously (25Andersen J.S. Lyon C.E. Fox A.H. Leung A.K. Lam Y.W. Steen H. Mann M. Lamond A.I. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). 3 × 106 H1299 cells were seeded. After 36 h, cells were harvested in PBS and cell pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2. Cells were broken with the loose pestle of a Dounce homogenizer, and nuclei were sedimented by centrifugation at 228 × g for 5 min. Supernatants (“cytoplasmic” fraction) were concentrated with Centricon tubes and stored. The pellet containing the nuclei was resuspended in 0.75 ml of 0.25 m sucrose and 10 mm MgCl2 and layered onto 0.75 ml of 0.35 m sucrose and 0.5 mm MgCl2. Samples were centrifuged at 1430 × g for 5 min to obtain purified nuclei. These were resuspended in 0.3 ml of 0.35 m sucrose and 0.5 mm MgCl2 and sonicated six times for 10 s. The effectiveness of the sonication was checked by microscopy. Samples were layered on top of 0.3 ml of 0.88 m sucrose and 0.5 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged at 2800 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were stored, and the pellets were resuspended in 0.1 ml of 0.35 m sucrose and 0.35 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged again at 2800 × g for 5 min. The pellet fraction contains the nucleoli. Samples were always maintained in ice, and centrifugations were carried out at 4 °C. Equivalent amounts of cytoplasmic, nuclear, nuclear non-nucleolar, and nucleolar fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence—U2OS cells (1 × 105/well) were seeded on two well Nunc Permanox slides. 36 h after transfection using the calcium phosphate method, cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol-acetone and incubated with primary antibodies followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) as described previously (26Laín S. Midgley C. Sparks A. Lane E.B. Lane D.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 457-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). p53 Reporter Assays—U2OS cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected with 60 ng of the RGCΔFos-lacZ p53 reporter plasmid, 60 ng of the control SV-promoter-dependent luciferase reporter, and 6.25 ng of the indicated p14ARF-expressing plasmids using FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described in a previous study (10Midgley C.A.

Cells were harvested at 48 h after transfection. β-Galactosidase activity was analyzed as described previously (10Midgley C.A. Desterro J.M.P. Saville M.K. Howard S. Sparks A. Hay R.T. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2312-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega) and a MicroLumat LB96V (EG&G Berthold) luminometer. Clonogenic Assays—5 × 104 U2OS cells were seeded to each well of a six-well plate (Nunc). After 24 h they were transfected with 1 μg of each indicated plasmid using FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as recommended by the manufacturer. 24 h after transfection, Neomycin-resistant cells were selected for 15 days using 1 mg/ml G418. After selection, the cells were fixed in methanol and stained with Giemsa. IVT and hMdm2 Binding—pcDNA3p14ARF is very poorly expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysates as well as in bacteria. To overcome these problems a T7- and histidine-tagged p14ARF gene was constructed (pET23bp14ARF). The codon usage of this construct was optimized for expression in Escherichia coli. Three sense primers, arf1 (5′-GGTAATCAAGCTAGAGCTCTATGGTGCGCCGTTTCCTGGTGACCCTGCGTATTCGTCGCGCGTGCGGCCCGCCGCGCGTACGTGTTTTCGTTGTTCA CAT), arf 3 (5′-GTTCTGATGCTGCTGCGTAGCCAGCGTCTGGGTCAGCAGCCGCTGCCGCGTCGTCCGGGTCATGATGATGGTCAGCGCCCGAGCGGCGGTGCTGCTGCT), and arf 5 (5′-TCCTGATGCCAAGCTTTTCGCCCGGACCACGAGCAGACGGACCCA GGCAACGCGCACGACCAGCCGCGCCACGGCCCGGTGCAGC ACCACCAGCGTGACCCGG), were annealed with three antisense primers, arf2 (5′-GCTACGCAGCAGCATCAGAACCAGTGCAACAGCCGCCGGCGCACCCGGCGCTGCCCACTCACCGGTCAGACGCGGGATGTGAACAACGAAAACACGTAC), Arf4 (5′-CCGGGTCACGCTGGTGGTGCTGCACCGGGCCGTGGCGCGGCTGG TCGTGCGCGTTGCCTGGGTCCGTCTGCTCGTGGTCCGGGCGAAAA GCTTGGCATCAGGA), Arf6 (5′-TCCTGATGCCAAGCTTTTCGCC), and then 20 rounds of PCR were used to extend from the overlapping ends. Each round of the PCR consisted of DNA denaturation for 1 min at 95 °C, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. The full-length ARF cDNA was amplified from 1 μl of this PCR, using the arf7 sense (5′-GGTAATCAAGCTAGAGCTCTAT) and arf6 antisense oligonucleotides, over 30 cycles, under the same cycling conditions described above. The 415-bp PCR product was gel-purified, digested with HindIII and SacI, and cloned into the pET23b vector. The gene was cloned in-frame for the production of p14ARF with a T7 tag at the amino terminus and a six-residue His tag at the carboxyl terminus. The gene was also cloned into the pcDNA3 vector for expression in mammalian cells. 35S-p14ARF was expressed from these constructs by in vitro transcription translation (IVT) using the TnT T7 Quick Coupled transcription/translation kit from Promega. 100 μl of IVT mix was mixed together with 2.4 μg of recombinant hMdm2 obtained as described previously (10Midgley C.A. Desterro J.M.P. Saville M.K. Howard S. Sparks A. Hay R.T. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2312-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. This mixture was divided into four aliquots, and the indicated antibodies, previously coupled to protein G (4B2 and DO2) or protein A (2A10 and 421) beads, were added. After 1 h of rotation at 4 °C antibody-bound complexes were purified by centrifugation and extensive washing in Nonidet P-40 buffer. Samples were run on 12% Novex gels with MOPS buffer in non-reducing conditions. 35S-Labeled bands were analyzed by autoradiography. Purification of Recombinant p14ARF—The E. coli strain BLR(DE3λ) was transformed with pET23b vectors encoding different forms of p14ARF. Bacteria were grown, and protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for up to 16 h. Bacteria were sedimented and resuspended in denaturing buffer (6 m guanidinium-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2), and then sonicated. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 30 min. Imidazole was added to the solubilized protein to a concentration of 10 mm and then passed through a 2-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column equilibrated with the denaturing buffer. The column was then washed with 20 ml of wash buffer (8 m urea, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2), followed by 10 ml with wash buffer with 15 mm imidazole. His-tagged protein was eluted in wash buffer with 300 mm imidazole. Protein was dialyzed extensively against Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer (see above) and diluted with 4 volumes of Nonidet P-40 buffer. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min, and supernatants were filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane. Total protein concentration was ∼1 mg/ml as determined by Bradford analysis. Alternatively, 12.5 μg of recombinant p14ARFC15,100,123A were diluted in 50 μl of the indicated buffer (RIPA/Nonidet P-40, 1:4) and filtered as above. 50 μl of sample (cell lysate or purified protein) were loaded onto a SuperdexTM 200HR gel filtration column and separated using the Amersham Biosciences Biotech Smart system. Equilibration and elution of the column were performed in the same buffer used for the dilution of the samples. 50-μl fractions were collected. Bio-Rad Gel Filtration Standards were used for calibration. Ectopic p14ARF Forms Homodimers—We observed that the electrophoretic mobility of p14ARF varies depending on the presence of reducing agents in the sample and electrophoresis buffers. As shown in Fig. 1A (left panel), in the presence of reducing agents most of p14ARF in soluble cell extracts migrates to a position that corresponds well with its molecular mass, ∼14 kDa. However, in the absence of reducing agents most of p14ARF in these cell extracts migrates to a position corresponding to ∼28-kDa and other p14ARF-related bands of slower mobility are also detected (Fig. 1A, right panel). The presence of the higher molecular mass forms of p14ARF was insensitive to the sulfhydryl chelating agent N-ethylmaleimide in the lysis buffer. This result indicated that the higher molecular mass forms of p14ARF are produced inside the cell and not during the cell lysate preparation procedure. To test whether the high molecular mass products actually contained the p14ARF moiety and were not due to the induction of the expression of proteins non-specifically recognized by the serum against p14ARF, we compared the mobility of full-length p14ARF with the mobility of a p14ARF deletion mutant lacking amino acid residues 2 through 14 (p14ARFΔ2–14). We observed that, under non-reducing electrophoresis conditions, a large proportion of this p14ARF deletion mutant migrated slightly faster than the 28-kDa band obtained with full-length p14ARF (Fig. 1B). This result unequivocally shows that p14ARF is able to oligomerize with itself or with other proteins of similar molecular mass. To test whether p14ARF forms homo-oligomers in vivo and that this did not occur during sample preparation, we analyzed the pattern of bands in the 28-kDa region in cells overexpressing the full-length p14ARF together with the p14ARFΔ2–14 deletion mutant. As in the experiment shown in Fig. 1A, a band of ∼28 kDa was observed when full-length ARF was overexpressed on its own (Fig. 1C, lane 1) and a band corresponding to a slightly smaller molecular mass form appeared when the cells were transfected with the construct expressing the p14ARFΔ2–14 deletion mutant (Fig. 1C, lane 2). When the full-length ARF and the p14ARFΔ2–14 deletion mutant were expressed together (Fig. 1C, lane 3), an additional intermediate band appeared. Furthermore, this extra band did not appear when cell pellets derived from cells transfected with either full-length p14ARF or the p14ARFΔ2–14 deletion mutant were mixed prior to lysis. This indicates that overexpressed p14ARF is able to form homodimers inside the cell. An equivalent result was obtained when these experiments were carried out using the U2OS cell line, and therefore, our observations are not limited to a single type of cell (see Fig. 9C below). Supporting that p14ARF can oligomerize with itself, high molecular weight forms of purified recombinant p14ARF could also be detected under non-reducing conditions (see below, Fig. 2C).Fig. 2The cysteine residues in human p14ARF are involved in the appearance of multimeric forms of p14ARF.A, analysis of the cysteine residues in the ARF sequence.

Cell pellets were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer, and the supernatants were analyzed by electrophoresis in non-reducing (left panel) and reducing (right panel) conditions and Western blotting using the rabbit polyclonal serum against p14ARF. C, purified recombinant His-tagged p14ARF (lanes 1) and p14ARFC15,100,123A (lanes 2) were analyzed by electrophoresis in non-reducing conditions. In the left panel, proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining. In the right panel proteins were detected by Western blot using an antibody against the His tag.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Cysteine Residues in Human p14ARF Are Involved in the Stabilization of the Multimeric Forms of p14ARF—Unlike Mdm2 (27Nasir L. Burr P.D. McFarlane S.T. Gault E. Thompson H. Argyle D.J. Cancer Lett. 2000; 152: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) ARF is poorly conserved between species. Only 38 of the 132 residues of human ARF are identical in both the mouse and opossum sequences (Fig. 2A). Human ARF (p14ARF) contains three cysteine residues at positions 15, 100, and 123 (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the first two cysteine residues are adjacent to the arginine-rich sequences that are involved in the nucleolar localization of human ARF (12Zhang Y.P. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 579-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 14Rizos H. Darmanian A.P. Mann G.J. Kefford R.F. Oncogene. 2000; 15: 2978-2985Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cysteine residues at positions 15 and 100 of human ARF are conserved in the sequence of the opossum ARF protein but absent in the reported murine ARF sequence. The lack of conservation of the first cysteine residue in the mouse sequence is not surprising, because the nucleolar localization signal for the mouse ARF protein (p19ARF) has been mapped further downstream in the region between residues 26 and 37 (15Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. BarSagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Coincidentally, there is a cysteine residue in the mouse sequence three residues downstream of the murine arginine-rich nucleolar localization signal. Although all three ARF sequences contain cysteine residues at the carboxyl terminus, cysteine 123 of the human p14ARF is only strictly conserved in mouse p19ARF. Given the effect of reducing conditions on the electrophoretic mobility of p14ARF described above, we proceeded to mutate the cysteine residues to alanine. Mutation of single cysteine residues still allowed the detection of the dimeric forms of p14ARF (Fig. 2B, lanes 2–4) and the substitution of cysteine 15 decreased the ability of p14ARF to form higher molecular mass complexes in SDS-gels (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Mutation of two of the three cysteines abolished the appearance of multimeric forms of p14ARF but did not affect the formation p14ARF dimers (Fig. 2B, lanes 5–7). Finally, the appearance of the dimeric and higher molecular forms of p14ARF was markedly decreased when all three cysteines were mutated (Fig. 2B, lane 8). These results show that all three cysteine residues in p14ARF are involved in the formation or the stabilization of homodimers and higher order forms. Recombinant p14ARF (His-tagged) analyzed in non-reducing conditions gave rise to the appearance of multimeric forms that were not present when the corresponding triple-cysteine mutant recombinant protein was analyzed (Fig. 2C). This supports that p14ARF can oligomerize with itself in the absence of other proteins. Cysteine-dependent p14ARF Oligomerization Increases in the Presence of the Oxidants—We then tested whether the oligomerization status of p14ARF was sensitive to the redox status in the cell. Cells overexpressing p14ARF were treated with two oxidizing agents, hydrogen peroxide or the sulfhydryl oxidizing agent azodicarboxylic acid bis(dimethylamide, diamide). As shown in Figs. 3 (A and B), after short incubations with these agents, the levels of high molecular mass forms of p14ARF increased in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and a concomitant decrease in the levels of monomeric p14ARF was observed. It must be stressed that in these and the previous experiments we were analyzing p14ARF in a soluble fraction prepared by lysing cells in mild conditions using the Nonidet P-40 buffer. Instead, most of p14ARF is in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 3C). Accordingly, extraction with harsher detergent conditions (SDS-PAGE loading buffer) dramatically increased the levels of p14ARF detected (Fig. 3C). Therefore, we also analyzed the effect of these oxidizing agents in whole cell extracts prepared by lysing the cells directly in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. As shown in Figs. 3C (left panel) and 3D, H2O2 and diamide have an effect on the total population of p14ARF by increasing the proportion of cysteine-linked oligomeric forms over the non-covalently linked forms of p14ARF. In Fig. 3C (right panel), it is shown that no increase in the oligomeric forms was detected with the triple-cysteine mutant of p14ARF (p14ARFC15,100,123A) when cells were subjected to H2O2 treatment. We also tested whether the appearance of the higher molecular mass forms after treatment of the cells with oxidizing conditions could be occurring during sample preparation. For this purpose we carried out a similar experiment as the one described in Fig. 1C. As shown in Fig. 3E, even in the presence of diamide, the i"
https://openalex.org/W2050032915,"We have previously shown that decorin, a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family of extracellular matrix proteoglycans/glycoproteins is a Zn2+ metalloprotein at physiological Zn2+ concentrations (Yang, V. W-C., LaBrenz, S. R., Rosenberg, L. C., McQuillan, D., and Höök, M. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 12454–12460). We now report that the decorin proteoglycan binds fibrinogen in the presence of Zn2+. The fibrinogen-binding site is located in the N-terminal domain of the decorin core protein and a 45-amino acid peptide representing this domain binds to the fibrinogen D fragment with an apparent KD of 1.7 × 10−6m, as determined from fluorescence polarization data. Furthermore, we show that Zn2+ promotes the self-association of decorin. The N-terminal domain of the core protein also mediates this activity. The results of solid-phase binding assays and gel filtration chromatography suggest that the N-terminal domain of decorin, when present at low micromolar concentrations, forms an oligomer in a Zn2+-dependent manner. Thus, Zn2+appears to play a pivotal role in the interactions and biological function of decorin. We have previously shown that decorin, a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family of extracellular matrix proteoglycans/glycoproteins is a Zn2+ metalloprotein at physiological Zn2+ concentrations (Yang, V.

Decorin is a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) 1The abbreviations used are: SLRPsmall leucine-rich proteoglycanECMextracellular matrixLRRleucine-rich repeatsMBPmaltose-binding proteinGSTglutathioneS-transferaseMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightDTTdithiothreitolCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid1The abbreviations used are: SLRPsmall leucine-rich proteoglycanECMextracellular matrixLRRleucine-rich repeatsMBPmaltose-binding proteinGSTglutathioneS-transferaseMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightDTTdithiothreitolCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid family of related glycoproteins found in mammalian extracellular matrices (ECMs) (2Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The core proteins of SLRPs are similar in structural organization and size, ranging from 35 to 42 kDa. The dominant structural feature is a central domain containing 6–10 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that is flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal regions with conserved Cys residues (3Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The LRR motif has been found in a number of proteins of diverse origin and function and varies in length from 20 to 29 amino acids (4Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Protein crystal structure analysis of the RNase inhibitor, internalin B, and glycoprotein 1B suggests that each LRR motif forms a β-strand/turn/helix, giving protein segments composed of tandem repeats of LRRs an arch-like shape (5Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 6Marino M. Braun L. Cossart P. Ghosh P. Mol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 35657-35663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The SLRPs contain 24-amino acid long LRRs and may also assume an arch-shaped structure as proposed by molecular modeling studies of decorin (8Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31767-31770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).SLRPs may be subgrouped based on gene organization, amino acid sequence similarity, the number of LRRs in the central domain, and the spacing of Cys residues in the N-terminal and C-terminal segments (3Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Members of subgroup I (10 LRRs) include decorin, biglycan, and a recently described molecule, asporin (9Lorenzo P. Aspberg A. Onnerfjord P. Bayliss M.T. Neame P.J. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12201-12211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 10Henry S.P. Takanosu M. Boyd T.C. Mayne P.M. Eberspaecher H. Zhou W. de Crombrugghe B. Hook M.

The former two may contain 1 or 2 dermatan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate chains in the N terminus, respectively, whereas the latter appears to occur exclusively as a glycoprotein with a N-terminal stretch of Asp residues. Fibromodulin, lumican, keratocan, and osteoadherin, which may be substituted with keratan sulfate polysaccharides in the LRR domain, as well as the glycoprotein PRELP, are the members of subgroup II (10 LRRs). Subgroup III (6 LRRs) includes epiphycan and osteoglycin, which may be substituted with dermatan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate polysaccharides, respectively, and the glycoprotein opticin (11Takanosu M. Boyd T.C. Le Goff M. Henry S.P. Zhang Y. Bishop P.N. Mayne R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2202-2210PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of a 12th member, chondroadherin, differs sufficiently from those of other SLRPs and perhaps should be assigned to a separate subgroup. The spacing of 4 Cys residues in the N-terminal sequence of the members of subgroups I, II, and III is CX3CXCX6C, CX3CXCX9C, and CX2CXCX6C, respectively.One theme in SLRP function appears to be the regulation of extracellular matrix architecture. Decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, and lumican reportedly interact with collagens and influence collagen fibrillogenesis in in vitro assays (12Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegard D. Biochem.

Analyses of transgenic mice generated with targeted inactivation of individual SLRP genes has revealed that the loss of function of each SLRP resulted in a mild phenotype characterized by the abnormal morphology of specific ECMs. Decorin or fibromodulin-deficient mice exhibit collagen fiber defects in tendon, whereas decorin or lumican-deficient mice have fragile skin, possibly because of abnormal collagen fibers in the dermis (17Danielson K.G.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Lumican-deficient mice also display abnormally thickened collagen fibers in the cornea. Recent studies suggest that the phenotype of mice deficient in both decorin and biglycan is more severe than those observed in cases where decorin or biglycan genes were individually inactivated (20Corsi A. Xu T. Chen X.D. Boyde A. Liang J. Mankani M. Sommer B. Iozzo R.V. Eichstetter I. Robey P.G. Bianco P. Young M.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1180-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate a certain degree of functional redundancy among the different SLRP members.SLRPs may differentially affect cell behavior by modulating growth factor activity or by influencing the interactions of cell surface receptors with matrix components. Transfection of the decorin cDNA into Chinese hamster ovary cells results in the overexpression of the proteoglycan and correlates with reduced proliferation, presumably because of an inhibition of transforming growth factor-β signaling (21Yamaguchi Y. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1988; 336: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Decorin has also been reported to inhibit the growth of certain cancer cell types by a mechanism thought to involve an interaction between decorin and the epidermal growth factor receptor (22Iozzo R.V. Moscatello D.K. McQuillan D.J. Eichstetter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4489-4492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The ability of SLRPs to affect cell-matrix interactions can involve SLRP-ECM or SLRP-integrin interactions. Decorin has been shown to interfere with the adhesion of mammalian cells to substrates composed of fibronectin and thrombospondin, and in a glycosaminoglycan-dependent manner, decorin inhibits cell migration on fibronectin and collagen matrices (23Winnemoller M. Schmidt G. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 10-17PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lewandowska K. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. Zardi L. Culp L.A. J.

Durussel L. Delmas P.D. Clezardin P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). On the other hand, osteoadherin and chondroadherin were shown to support osteoblast and chondrocyte adhesion through interactions with integrins αvβ3 and α2β1, respectively (27Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Heinegard D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 28Camper L. Heinegard D. Lundgren-Akerlund E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).We recently demonstrated that decorin and biglycan are Zn2+metalloproteins (1Yang V.W. LaBrenz S.R. Rosenberg L.C. McQuillan D. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12454-12460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The results of equilibrium dialysis experiments indicated that both decorin and biglycan bind 2 Zn2+ ions with a KD of ∼2 × 10−6m2. Utilizing Zn2+-chelate chromatography, the Zn2+-binding sites on decorin were localized to the N-terminal sequence of the core protein. Furthermore, a Zn2+-induced change in the circular dichroism spectrum for a peptide mimicking the N-terminal domain suggests that Zn2+ may affect the conformation of this segment of the core protein. These observations lead us to search for a possible functional consequence of the putative structural changes arising from Zn2+ binding to decorin. We now report that Zn2+ influences the binding of decorin to several matrix molecules, including collagens, fibronectin, and fibrinogen. Because the interaction of decorin with fibrinogen to our knowledge has not been previously reported, we decided to characterize the Zn2+-enhanced binding of decorin to fibrinogen.DISCUSSIONWe show here that Zn2+ promotes the interaction of decorin proteoglycan with fibrinogen. Fibrinogen circulates in blood as a soluble 340-kDa glycoprotein at a concentration of ∼9 μm (38Herrick S. Blanc-Brude O. Gray A. Laurent G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). During the final stage of the clotting cascade, thrombin cleaves fibrinopeptides from the central E region of fibrinogen to yield fibrin that rapidly assembles into a provisional matrix. When vascular damage causes the extravasation of blood, fibrinogen comes in contact with extracellular matrix components, including decorin exhibiting a broad tissue distribution (39Voss B. Glossl J. Cully Z. Kresse H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 40Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Robey P.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The possibility that decorin and fibrinogen may co-localize in the extracellular milieu during wound repair coupled with our interest in the role of Zn2+ as a regulator of decorin structure and function lead us to further characterize the decorin-fibrinogen interaction.The domains that mediate decorin-fibrinogen binding were deduced from our analysis of the results of solid phase and fluorescence polarization binding assays. We determined that recombinant decorin proteoglycan, expressed by mammalian cells using vaccinia virus as well as recombinant forms of the N-terminal domain produced in E. coli exhibit equivalent apparent KD values for binding to fibrinogen-coated wells. Thus, additional decorin core protein segments beyond the N-terminal domain do not appear to be required for stable binding to fibrinogen or fragment D. MBPDcnNTD bound to fragment D-coated wells with an apparent KDof 9.0 × 10−8m. However, fragment D binding to DcnNTD in solution approached saturation with an estimatedKD of 1.7 × 10−6m. These divergent observations could be a consequence of the complexity of the molecular interactions under study. For instance, the possibility that several multimeric forms of the decorin peptide are present and that they may differ in affinity for the D domain of fibrinogen has not been incorporated into our analyses. In addition, the conformation of the fibrinogen D domain reportedly may be altered by immobilization (41Lishko V.K. Kudryk B. Yakubenko V.P. Yee V.C. Ugarova T.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12942-12951Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Hence, the apparent KDvalues depend on the experimental conditions of the assay. Nevertheless, we show here that the N-terminal Zn2+-binding domain of decorin interacts with the D region of fibrinogen with a reasonable affinity.Decorin and biglycan are self-associating Zn2+metalloproteins. A previous report showed that biglycan proteoglycan is hexameric in the presence of Zn2+ and dimeric in the presence of EDTA (37Liu J. Laue T.M. Choi H.U. Tang L.H. Rosenberg L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28366-28373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, we discovered that both decorin and biglycan bind 2 Zn2+ ions with the N-terminal segment of the core protein (1Yang V.W. LaBrenz S.R. Rosenberg L.C. McQuillan D. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12454-12460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We now propose that the N-terminal domain of decorin core protein mediates the Zn2+-dependent formation of oligomers. Our gel filtration chromatography experiments show that Zn2+-charged DcnNTD elutes as a broad peak, possibly indicating the coexistence of several oligomeric forms in the presence of Zn2+. Similarly, we observed several overlapping peaks during gel filtration chromatography of MBPDcnNTD in the presence of Zn2+ (data not shown). We also noticed that the peak elution volume of DcnNTD shifts to slightly higher volume as we decrease the concentration of peptide loaded, suggesting a dissociation of oligomers (data not shown). Moreover, DcnNTD oligomers are effectively dissociated by incubation with excess EDTA. Liu and colleagues (37Liu J. Laue T.M. Choi H.U. Tang L.H. Rosenberg L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28366-28373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the biglycan core protein, lacking the 2 chondroitin sulfate polysaccharides normally attached to the N-terminal domain, formed aggregates in the presence of Zn2+. We did not detect DcnNTD or MBPDcnNTD in the column void volume and observed saturation binding of DcnNTD to MBPDcnNTD-coated wells. Taken together, these results indicate that the N-terminal domain can form oligomeric structures with defined compositions.The mechanism(s) whereby Zn2+ promotes the binding of decorin to a variety of other matrix components including types I, IV, and V collagen, fibronectin, and fibrinogen remains to be determined. In some cases, perhaps increased decorin binding in the presence of Zn2+ is attributable to the formation of oligomeric forms that bind to the adsorbed matrix proteins; whereas reduced apparent binding in the presence of EDTA may reflect bound monomeric forms. Alternatively, Zn2+ may play a role in the folding and structure of the decorin N-terminal domain. In this case, the conformation of the N-terminal domain formed in the presence of Zn2+ exhibits a higher affinity for some matrix molecules, such as fibrinogen, than the conformation of the N-terminal domain in the presence of EDTA. Our study illustrates the significance of Zn2+ as a modulator of decorin structure and function. This relationship should be considered in future efforts to elucidate the biological function(s) of decorin and perhaps other SLRPs.The biological consequence(s) of a putative decorin-fibrinogen interaction is unclear at this time. To determine whether these molecules can interact in a physiological setting, we passed human plasma over a decorin matrix composed of MBPDcnNTD covalently attached to Sepharose 4B. SDS-PAGE and Western blots showed that both fibrinogen and fibronectin were retained by the decorin matrix during extensive washing and eluted with EDTA (data not shown). Retention of fibronectin by the decorin N-terminal domain is interesting because a previous study postulated a second fibronectin-binding site on decorin, in addition to the previously reported NKISK site of LRR 1 (42Schmidt G. Hausser H. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen, in the form of fibrin, and fibronectin represent dominant protein components of the provisional matrix formed during the initial stage of wound repair (43Clark R.A. Lanigan J.M. DellaPelle P. Manseau E. Dvorak H.F. Colvin R.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1982; 79: 264-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). When present at sites of wound repair, decorin might participate in organizing the structure of the provisional matrix, thus one could speculate that decorin plays a role in the wound healing process. Decorin is a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) 1The abbreviations used are: SLRPsmall leucine-rich proteoglycanECMextracellular matrixLRRleucine-rich repeatsMBPmaltose-binding proteinGSTglutathioneS-transferaseMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightDTTdithiothreitolCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid1The abbreviations used are: SLRPsmall leucine-rich proteoglycanECMextracellular matrixLRRleucine-rich repeatsMBPmaltose-binding proteinGSTglutathioneS-transferaseMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightDTTdithiothreitolCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid family of related glycoproteins found in mammalian extracellular matrices (ECMs) (2Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The core proteins of SLRPs are similar in structural organization and size, ranging from 35 to 42 kDa. The dominant structural feature is a central domain containing 6–10 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that is flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal regions with conserved Cys residues (3Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The LRR motif has been found in a number of proteins of diverse origin and function and varies in length from 20 to 29 amino acids (4Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Protein crystal structure analysis of the RNase inhibitor, internalin B, and glycoprotein 1B suggests that each LRR motif forms a β-strand/turn/helix, giving protein segments composed of tandem repeats of LRRs an arch-like shape (5Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 6Marino M. Braun L. Cossart P. Ghosh P. Mol.

The SLRPs contain 24-amino acid long LRRs and may also assume an arch-shaped structure as proposed by molecular modeling studies of decorin (8Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31767-31770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). small leucine-rich proteoglycan extracellular matrix leucine-rich repeats maltose-binding protein glutathioneS-transferase matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight dithiothreitol 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid small leucine-rich proteoglycan extracellular matrix leucine-rich repeats maltose-binding protein glutathioneS-transferase matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight dithiothreitol 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid SLRPs may be subgrouped based on gene organization, amino acid sequence similarity, the number of LRRs in the central domain, and the spacing of Cys residues in the N-terminal and C-terminal segments (3Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Members of subgroup I (10 LRRs) include decorin, biglycan, and a recently described molecule, asporin (9Lorenzo P. Aspberg A. Onnerfjord P. Bayliss M.T. Neame P.J. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12201-12211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 10Henry S.P. Takanosu M. Boyd T.C. Mayne P.M. Eberspaecher H. Zhou W. de Crombrugghe B. Hook M. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12212-12221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The former two may contain 1 or 2 dermatan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate chains in the N terminus, respectively, whereas the latter appears to occur exclusively as a glycoprotein with a N-terminal stretch of Asp residues. Fibromodulin, lumican, keratocan, and osteoadherin, which may be substituted with keratan sulfate polysaccharides in the LRR domain, as well as the glycoprotein PRELP, are the members of subgroup II (10 LRRs). Subgroup III (6 LRRs) includes epiphycan and osteoglycin, which may be substituted with dermatan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate polysaccharides, respectively, and the glycoprotein opticin (11Takanosu M. Boyd T.C. Le Goff M. Henry S.P. Zhang Y. Bishop P.N. Mayne R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2202-2210PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of a 12th member, chondroadherin, differs sufficiently from those of other SLRPs and perhaps should be assigned to a separate subgroup. The spacing of 4 Cys residues in the N-terminal sequence of the members of subgroups I, II, and III is CX3CXCX6C, CX3CXCX9C, and CX2CXCX6C, respectively. One theme in SLRP function appears to be the regulation of extracellular matrix architecture. Decorin, biglycan, fibromodulin, and lumican reportedly interact with collagens and influence collagen fibrillogenesis in in vitro assays (12Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegard D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 13Brown D.C. Vogel K.G. Matrix. 1989; 9: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 14Hedbom E. Heinegard D. J. Biol.

Analyses of transgenic mice generated with targeted inactivation of individual SLRP genes has revealed that the loss of function of each SLRP resulted in a mild phenotype characterized by the abnormal morphology of specific ECMs. Decorin or fibromodulin-deficient mice exhibit collagen fiber defects in tendon, whereas decorin or lumican-deficient mice have fragile skin, possibly because of abnormal collagen fibers in the dermis (17Danielson K.G.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Lumican-deficient mice also display abnormally thickened collagen fibers in the cornea. Recent studies suggest that the phenotype of mice deficient in both decorin and biglycan is more severe than those observed in cases where decorin or biglycan genes were individually inactivated (20Corsi A. Xu T. Chen X.D. Boyde A. Liang J. Mankani M. Sommer B. Iozzo R.V. Eichstetter I. Robey P.G. Bianco P. Young M.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1180-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate a certain degree of functional redundancy among the different SLRP members. SLRPs may differentially affect cell behavior by modulating growth factor activity or by influencing the interactions of cell surface receptors with matrix components. Transfection of the decorin cDNA into Chinese hamster ovary cells results in the overexpression of the proteoglycan and correlates with reduced proliferation, presumably because of an inhibition of transforming growth factor-β signaling (21Yamaguchi Y. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1988; 336: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Decorin has also been reported to inhibit the growth of certain cancer cell types by a mechanism thought to involve an interaction between decorin and the epidermal growth factor receptor (22Iozzo R.V. Moscatello D.K. McQuillan D.J. Eichstetter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4489-4492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The ability of SLRPs to affect cell-matrix interactions can involve SLRP-ECM or SLRP-integrin interactions. Decorin has been shown to interfere with the adhesion of mammalian cells to substrates composed of fibronectin and thrombospondin, and in a glycosaminoglycan-dependent manner, decorin inhibits cell migration on fibronectin and collagen matrices (23Winnemoller M. Schmidt G. Kresse H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 54: 10-17PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lewandowska K. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. Zardi L. Culp L.A. J.

Durussel L. Delmas P.D. Clezardin P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). On the other hand, osteoadherin and chondroadherin were shown to support osteoblast and chondrocyte adhesion through interactions with integrins αvβ3 and α2β1, respectively (27Wendel M. Sommarin Y. Heinegard D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 28Camper L. Heinegard D. Lundgren-Akerlund E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that decorin and biglycan are Zn2+metalloproteins (1Yang V.W. LaBrenz S.R. Rosenberg L.C. McQuillan D. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12454-12460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The results of equilibrium dialysis experiments indicated that both decorin and biglycan bind 2 Zn2+ ions with a KD of ∼2 × 10−6m2. Utilizing Zn2+-chelate chromatography, the Zn2+-binding sites on decorin were localized to the N-terminal sequence of the core protein. Furthermore, a Zn2+-induced change in the circular dichroism spectrum for a peptide mimicking the N-terminal domain suggests that Zn2+ may affect the conformation of this segment of the core protein. These observations lead us to search for a possible functional consequence of the putative structural changes arising from Zn2+ binding to decorin. We now report that Zn2+ influences the binding of decorin to several matrix molecules, including collagens, fibronectin, and fibrinogen. Because the interaction of decorin with fibrinogen to our knowledge has not been previously reported, we decided to characterize the Zn2+-enhanced binding of decorin to fibrinogen. DISCUSSIONWe show here that Zn2+ promotes the interaction of decorin proteoglycan with fibrinogen. Fibrinogen circulates in blood as a soluble 340-kDa glycoprotein at a concentration of ∼9 μm (38Herrick S. Blanc-Brude O. Gray A. Laurent G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). During the final stage of the clotting cascade, thrombin cleaves fibrinopeptides from the central E region of fibrinogen to yield fibrin that rapidly assembles into a provisional matrix. When vascular damage causes the extravasation of blood, fibrinogen comes in contact with extracellular matrix components, including decorin exhibiting a broad tissue distribution (39Voss B. Glossl J. Cully Z. Kresse H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 40Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Robey P.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The possibility that decorin and fibrinogen may co-localize in the extracellular milieu during wound repair coupled with our interest in the role of Zn2+ as a regulator of decorin structure and function lead us to further characterize the decorin-fibrinogen interaction.The domains that mediate decorin-fibrinogen binding were deduced from our analysis of the results of solid phase and fluorescence polarization binding assays. We determined that recombinant decorin proteoglycan, expressed by mammalian cells using vaccinia virus as well as recombinant forms of the N-terminal domain produced in E. coli exhibit equivalent apparent KD values for binding to fibrinogen-coated wells. Thus, additional decorin core protein segments beyond the N-terminal domain do not appear to be required for stable binding to fibrinogen or fragment D. MBPDcnNTD bound to fragment D-coated wells with an apparent KDof 9.0 × 10−8m. However, fragment D binding to DcnNTD in solution approached saturation with an estimatedKD of 1.7 × 10−6m. These divergent observations could be a consequence of the complexity of the molecular interactions under study. For instance, the possibility that several multimeric forms of the decorin peptide are present and that they may differ in affinity for the D domain of fibrinogen has not been incorporated into our analyses. In addition, the conformation of the fibrinogen D domain reportedly may be altered by immobilization (41Lishko V.K. Kudryk B. Yakubenko V.P. Yee V.C. Ugarova T.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12942-12951Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Hence, the apparent KDvalues depend on the experimental conditions of the assay. Nevertheless, we show here that the N-terminal Zn2+-binding domain of decorin interacts with the D region of fibrinogen with a reasonable affinity.Decorin and biglycan are self-associating Zn2+metalloproteins. A previous report showed that biglycan proteoglycan is hexameric in the presence of Zn2+ and dimeric in the presence of EDTA (37Liu J. Laue T.M. Choi H.U. Tang L.H. Rosenberg L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28366-28373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, we discovered that both decorin and biglycan bind 2 Zn2+ ions with the N-terminal segment of the core protein (1Yang V.W. LaBrenz S.R. Rosenberg L.C. McQuillan D. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12454-12460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We now propose that the N-terminal domain of decorin core protein mediates the Zn2+-dependent formation of oligomers. Our gel filtration chromatography experiments show that Zn2+-charged DcnNTD elutes as a broad peak, possibly indicating the coexistence of several oligomeric forms in the presence of Zn2+. Similarly, we observed several overlapping peaks during gel filtration chromatography of MBPDcnNTD in the presence of Zn2+ (data not shown). We also noticed that the peak elution volume of DcnNTD shifts to slightly higher volume as we decrease the concentration of peptide loaded, suggesting a dissociation of oligomers (data not shown). Moreover, DcnNTD oligomers are effectively dissociated by incubation with excess EDTA. Liu and colleagues (37Liu J. Laue T.M. Choi H.U. Tang L.H. Rosenberg L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28366-28373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the biglycan core protein, lacking the 2 chondroitin sulfate polysaccharides normally attached to the N-terminal domain, formed aggregates in the presence of Zn2+. We did not detect DcnNTD or MBPDcnNTD in the column void volume and observed saturation binding of DcnNTD to MBPDcnNTD-coated wells. Taken together, these results indicate that the N-terminal domain can form oligomeric structures with defined compositions.The mechanism(s) whereby Zn2+ promotes the binding of decorin to a variety of other matrix components including types I, IV, and V collagen, fibronectin, and fibrinogen remains to be determined. In some cases, perhaps increased decorin binding in the presence of Zn2+ is attributable to the formation of oligomeric forms that bind to the adsorbed matrix proteins; whereas reduced apparent binding in the presence of EDTA may reflect bound monomeric forms. Alternatively, Zn2+ may play a role in the folding and structure of the decorin N-terminal domain. In this case, the conformation of the N-terminal domain formed in the presence of Zn2+ exhibits a higher affinity for some matrix molecules, such as fibrinogen, than the conformation of the N-terminal domain in the presence of EDTA. Our study illustrates the significance of Zn2+ as a modulator of decorin structure and function. This relationship should be considered in future efforts to elucidate the biological function(s) of decorin and perhaps other SLRPs.The biological consequence(s) of a putative decorin-fibrinogen interaction is unclear at this time. To determine whether these molecules can interact in a physiological setting, we passed human plasma over a decorin matrix composed of MBPDcnNTD covalently attached to Sepharose 4B. SDS-PAGE and Western blots showed that both fibrinogen and fibronectin were retained by the decorin matrix during extensive washing and eluted with EDTA (data not shown). Retention of fibronectin by the decorin N-terminal domain is interesting because a previous study postulated a second fibronectin-binding site on decorin, in addition to the previously reported NKISK site of LRR 1 (42Schmidt G. Hausser H. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen, in the form of fibrin, and fibronectin represent dominant protein components of the provisional matrix formed during the initial stage of wound repair (43Clark R.A. Lanigan J.M.

In some cases, perhaps increased decorin binding in the presence of Zn2+ is attributable to the formation of oligomeric forms that bind to the adsorbed matrix proteins; whereas reduced apparent binding in the presence of EDTA may reflect bound monomeric forms. Alternatively, Zn2+ may play a role in the folding and structure of the decorin N-terminal domain. In this case, the conformation of the N-terminal domain formed in the presence of Zn2+ exhibits a higher affinity for some matrix molecules, such as fibrinogen, than the conformation of the N-terminal domain in the presence of EDTA. Our study illustrates the significance of Zn2+ as a modulator of decorin structure and function. This relationship should be considered in future efforts to elucidate the biological function(s) of decorin and perhaps other SLRPs. The biological consequence(s) of a putative decorin-fibrinogen interaction is unclear at this time. To determine whether these molecules can interact in a physiological setting, we passed human plasma over a decorin matrix composed of MBPDcnNTD covalently attached to Sepharose 4B. SDS-PAGE and Western blots showed that both fibrinogen and fibronectin were retained by the decorin matrix during extensive washing and eluted with EDTA (data not shown). Retention of fibronectin by the decorin N-terminal domain is interesting because a previous study postulated a second fibronectin-binding site on decorin, in addition to the previously reported NKISK site of LRR 1 (42Schmidt G. Hausser H. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen, in the form of fibrin, and fibronectin represent dominant protein components of the provisional matrix formed during the initial stage of wound repair (43Clark R.A. Lanigan J.M. DellaPelle P. Manseau E. Dvorak H.F. Colvin R.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1982; 79: 264-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). When present at sites of wound repair, decorin might participate in organizing the structure of the provisional matrix, thus one could speculate that decorin plays a role in the wound healing process."
https://openalex.org/W1991643032,"Tapasin plays an important role in the quality control of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I assembly, but its precise function in this process remains controversial. Whether tapasin participates in the assembly of HLA-G has not been studied. HLA-G, an MHC class Ib molecule that binds a more restricted set of peptides than class Ia molecules, is a particularly interesting molecule, because during assembly, it recycles between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the cis-Golgi until it is loaded with a high affinity peptide. We have taken advantage of this unusual trafficking property of HLA-G and its requirement for high affinity peptides to demonstrate that a critical function of tapasin is to transform class I molecules into a high affinity, peptide-receptive form. In the absence of tapasin, HLA-G molecules cannot bind high affinity peptides, and an abundant supply of peptides cannot overcome the tapasin requirement for high affinity peptide loading. The addition of tapasin renders HLA-G molecules capable of loading high affinity peptides and of transporting to the surface, suggesting that tapasin is a prerequisite for the binding of high-affinity ligands. Interestingly, the “tapasin-dependent” HLA-G molecules are not empty in the absence of tapasin but are in fact associated with suboptimal peptides and continue to recycle between the ER and the cis-Golgi. Together with the finding that empty HLA-G heterodimers are strictly retained in the ER and degraded, our data suggest that MHC class I molecules bind any available peptides to avoid ER-mediated degradation and that the peptides are in turn replaced by higher affinity peptides with the aid of tapasin.

This complex includes calnexin, calreticulin, ERp57, transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), and tapasin (1Cresswell P. Bangia N. Dick T. Diedrich G. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). MHC class I molecules are divided into two types based on their polymorphism and levels of expression. The highly expressed polymorphic class Ia molecules bind a diverse set of peptides derived from the cytosol, whereas the less abundant, tissue-specific, nonpolymorphic class Ib molecules bind a more restricted set of peptides (2Shawar S.M. Vyas J.M. Rodgers J.R. Rich R.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 839-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Tapasin is indispensable for the proper function of the class Ia antigen presentation pathway. In tapasin mutant mice, the expression and stability of surface class I molecules are strongly reduced. In tapasin double-negative cells, the presentation of cytosolic antigens is markedly impaired (3Garbi N. Tan P. Diehl A.D. Chambers B.J. Ljunggren H.G. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Defects in the development of CD8+ T cells and immune responses against some viruses were also noted in tapasin double-negative mice (4Grandea III, A.G. Golovina T.N. Hamilton S.E. Sriram V. Spies T.

Like class Ia molecules, tapasin plays an important role in the assembly and surface expression of certain class Ib molecules such as HLA-E (5Braud V.M. Allan D.S. Wilson D. McMichael A.J. Curr.

It functions to bridge the heavy chain complexes to TAP (8Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Tapasin expression also enhances the stability of TAP heterodimers, increasing overall peptide transport into the ER (9Li S. Paulsson K.M. Chen S. Sjogren H.O. Wang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1581-1586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Lehner P.J. Surman M.J. Cresswell P.

Grandea III, A.G. Spies T. Peterson P.A. Yang Y. Fruh K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Likewise, in tapasin-deficient human 721.220 cells, tapasin prevents premature release of Kb molecules from the ER, suggesting that tapasin might participate in retaining class I molecules in the ER until an optimal peptide is loaded (12Barnden M.J. Purcell A.W. Gorman J.J. McCluskey J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Finally, other recent studies have suggested that tapasin might be involved in the peptide editing of class I molecules (13Lewis J.W. Elliott T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 717-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Purcell A.W. Gorman J.J. Garcia-Peydro M. Paradela A. Burrows S.R. Talbo G.H. Laham N. Peh C.A. Reynolds E.C.

Immunity. 2002; 16: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Although there is little doubt that tapasin is a class I-dedicated chaperone, the actual mechanism for each proposed function of tapasin during its interactions with class I alleles remains to be elucidated. Tapasin dependence could reflect a direct role for tapasin in ER retention of heavy chains, TAP stabilization, peptide editing, or any combination of these functions. Determining which of these interrelated functions are primary rather than secondary manifestations of tapasin's interactions with class I molecules has proven to be difficult. In addition to the uncertainty regarding the precise functions of tapasin, various class Ia molecules differ in their dependence on tapasin for both efficient surface expression and presentation of antigenic determinants to CTL, as observed in studies of 721.220 transfectants (13Lewis J.W. Elliott T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 717-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Peh C.A. Burrows S.R. Barnden M. Khanna R. Cresswell P. Moss D.J. McCluskey J.

In 721.220 cells, tapasin is not required for high levels of surface expression of the HLA-B2705 allele or for presentation of viral determinants to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (16Peh C.A. Burrows S.R. Barnden M. Khanna R. Cresswell P. Moss D.J. McCluskey J. Immunity. 1998; 8: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In contrast, for the HLA-B4402 allele, functional antigen presentation and surface expression are highly dependent on tapasin; HLA-B0801 falls between the B2705 and B4402 alleles in the spectrum of tapasin dependence (16Peh C.A. Burrows S.R. Barnden M. Khanna R. Cresswell P. Moss D.J. McCluskey J. Immunity. 1998; 8: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These relationships reflect the complexity of tapasin function. In fact, the aforementioned studies regarding the function of tapasin took place before the concept was established that the tapasin dependence of class I molecules is allele-specific. Thus, the conclusions of these studies might be biased, depending on which class I alleles were analyzed. HLA-G, an MHC class Ib molecule, is expressed primarily in trophoblast cells and has limited polymorphism (2Shawar S.M. Vyas J.M. Rodgers J.R. Rich R.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 839-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Due to a scarcity of natural endogenous peptide ligands in most cells, the supply of peptides is the rate-limiting factor for the intracellular transport kinetics of HLA-G (19Park B. Lee S. Kim E. Chang S. Jin M. Ahn K. Immunity. 2001; 15: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recent evidence shows that HLA-G protects trophoblast cells from recognition by NK cells (20Munz C. Holmes N. King A. Loke Y.W. Colonna M. Schild H. Rammensee H.G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Rajagopalan S. Long E.O. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar); expression of HLA-G on melanoma cells protects them from lysis by NK cells (22Paul P. Rouas-Freiss N. Khalil-Daher I. Moreau P. Riteau B. Le Gal F.A. Avril M.F. Dausset J. Guillet J.G. Carosella E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4510-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). HLA-G is a particularly interesting molecule in protein trafficking, because it recycles between the ER and the cis-Golgi until it is loaded with a high affinity peptide (19Park B. Lee S. Kim E. Chang S. Jin M. Ahn K. Immunity. 2001; 15: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This feature makes it possible to estimate whether HLA-G molecules are loaded with high affinity or low affinity peptides. Whether the process involved in the assembly of MHC class Ia molecule-peptide complexes applies to the assembly of HLA-G-peptide complexes has not been studied. Because HLA-G binds a restricted set of peptides (23Diehl M. Munz C. Keilholz W. Stevanovic S. Holmes N. Loke Y.W. Rammensee H.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 305-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Lee N. Malacko A.R. Ishitani A. Chen M.C. Bajorath J. Marquardt H. Geraghty D.E. Immunity. 1995; 3: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and recycles between the ER andcis-Golgi, it is an attractive model for investigating the roles of individual components of the ER peptide-loading complex in the assembly of functional MHC class I molecules. In this study, we examined the tapasin dependence of HLA-G in terms of tapasin's critical role in the assembly and intracellular transport of HLA-G. Our findings demonstrate that in the absence of tapasin, HLA-G molecules are not able to bind high affinity peptides despite an abundant supply of peptides, suggesting that tapasin is a prerequisite for the binding of high affinity peptides. Interestingly, immediately after synthesis, these tapasin-dependent HLA-G molecules associate constitutively with low affinity endogenous peptides and exit the ER, thereby avoiding ER-mediated degradation. We propose that a critical function of tapasin is to transform the peptide-binding groove of HLA-G into a high affinity, peptide-receptive form, which could promote the replacement of low affinity peptides with high affinity peptides. All HLA cDNAs and their mutagenized derivatives were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The cDNA encoding human tapasin was kindly provided by Dr. Cresswell (Yale University, New Haven, CT) and was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/Hygro vector (Invitrogen). The cDNA encoding human β2m was contained in the pcDNA3.1/Neomycin vector (Invitrogen). Point mutations of HLA-G were made by changing the codons by PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The sequences for all mutations were confirmed by sequencing. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). NIH3T3 cells were transfected with either human β2m cDNA or human β2m and human tapasin cDNAs. Stable transfectants expressing human β2m (NIH3T3.hβ2m) were selected with 1 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). Stable transfectants expressing both human β2m and human tapasin (NIH3T3.hβ2m.hTpn) were selected with 1 mg/ml G418 and 0.35 mg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). Tapasin expression was restored in 721.220 cells by transfection with the cDNA encoding human tapasin, and transfectants were selected with 0.35 mg/ml hygromycin, giving rise to the 721.220.Tpn cell line. The 721.220 and 721.220.Tpn cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). The HLA-G-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) G233 was a gift from Dr. Loke (University of Cambridge). The mAb W6/32 recognizes only MHC class I heavy chains associated with β2m. Polyclonal rabbit K455 antibody reacts with MHC class I heavy chains and β2m in both assembled and nonassembled forms. The rabbit polyclonal antibody to human tapasin (R.gp48N) was a gift from Dr. Cresswell. The rabbit polyclonal antibody to PDI (SPA-890) and the anti-β-COP mAb M3A5 were purchased from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada) and Sigma, respectively. The mAb to the cis-Golgi marker GM130 was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Franklin Lakes, NJ.). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was purchased from Pierce. Cells (5 × 106) were transfected by electroporation, starved for 40 min in medium lacking methionine, labeled for 20 min with 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (TranS-label; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and chased for the indicated times in normal medium. Cells were lysed by using 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. After preclearing lysates with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), primary antibodies and protein G-Sepharose were added to the supernatant and incubated at 4 °C with rotation for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS. Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried, exposed to BAS film for 14 h, and analyzed with the phosphorimaging system BAS-2500 (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). For endoglycosidase-H (endo-H) treatment, immunoprecipitates were digested with 3 milliunits of endo-H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C overnight in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.6), 0.3% SDS, and 150 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). The surface expression of HLA-G molecules was determined by flow cytometry (FACScalibur, Becton Dickinson Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). Cells (1 × 106) were washed twice with cold PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with a saturating concentration of mAb G233. Normal mouse IgG was used as a negative control for each test. The cells were washed twice with cold PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min. A total of 10,000 gated events were collected by the FACScalibur cytometer and analyzed with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson Biosciences). For immunofluorescence staining of permeabilized cells, NIH3T3 cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, made permeable with 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody for 1 h. MRC-1024 confocal microscopy was used for confocal imaging (Bio-Rad). Cells were lysed in 1% digitonin in digitonin buffer containing 25 mmHEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.6) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, samples were incubated with the appropriate antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C before protein G-Sepharose beads were added. Beads were washed four times with 0.1% digitonin, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h, and probed with the appropriate antibodies for 4 h. Membranes were washed three times in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce) for 1 h. The immunoblots were visualized with ECL detection reagent (Pierce). Microsomes from 721.220 and 721.220.Tpn cells expressing HLA-G or HLA-G/E114H heavy chains were prepared and purified as previously described (25Saraste J. Palade G.E. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6425-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Biotinylated peptide KIPAQFYIL was conjugated to the photoreactive cross-linker N-5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyloxysuccinimide (ANB-NOS; Pierce) as described (9Li S. Paulsson K.M. Chen S. Sjogren H.O. Wang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1581-1586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For the peptide-loading assay, reporter peptides, with or without various concentrations of the unlabeled peptide (KIPAQFYIL), were mixed with 15 μl of microsomes (concentration of 60 A280/ml) in a total volume of 50 μl of RM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mmtriethanolamine-HCl, 50 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm ATP). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 26 °C in a flat-bottomed 96-well tissue culture plate. The samples were maintained on ice during a 3-min exposure to shortwave (365-nm) ultraviolet irradiation. After centrifugation, the membranes were washed once with cold RM buffer and lysed with 1% digitonin, and the cross-linked proteins were immunoprecipitated with mAb G233. The precipitates were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 1 h, and biotinylated proteins were visualized by using ECL Western blotting reagent (Pierce). Peptide translocation was determined after incubating microsomes with biotin-conjugated reporter peptides in the absence of competitor for 30 min at 26 °C with or without 1 mm ATP. Microsomal membranes were recovered by centrifugation at 75,000 × g for 10 min through a 0.5m sucrose cushion in cold RM buffer. After washing with cold RM buffer twice, the membrane pellet was directly dissolved in sample buffer. The samples were analyzed on Tricine/SDS-PAGE, appropriate for resolution of low mass polypeptides as described (26Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar), and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. The relative densities of the peptide bands were determined by use of an imaging densitometer (GS-700; Bio-Rad) and MultiAnalyst densitometer software (Bio-Rad). To determine the function of tapasin for the assembly of HLA-G-peptide complexes, we first examined the tapasin dependence of HLA-G for cell surface expression. The genes encoding HLA-G heavy chains were independently transfected into both 721.220 and 721.220.Tpn cell lines. In the absence of tapasin, low levels of surface expression were observed (Fig.1A). Significantly, upon expression of tapasin, surface expression increased more than 5-fold, indicating the dependence of HLA-G on tapasin for its surface expression. In recent efforts to identify the factors that determine the relative tapasin dependence of various class Ia alleles, we have found that the nature of the amino acid residues present at the naturally polymorphic position 114 determines tapasin dependence. 2B. Park and K. Ahn, unpublished data. To test whether this is also the case for the HLA-G molecules, we constructed substitution mutants and examined their dependence on tapasin for surface expression (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, a glutamic acid to histidine substitution at position 114 (HLA-G/E114H) allows the otherwise tapasin-dependent HLA-G to have levels of surface expression comparable with the levels seen in the presence of tapasin. The HLA-G/E114Q mutant, in which residue 114 was replaced by the neutrally charged glutamine, fell between HLA-G wild type and HLA-G/E114H in the spectrum of tapasin dependence. These results indicate that, like HLA class Ia molecules, the tapasin dependence of HLA-G is also influenced by the nature of the amino acid at position 114. Since it is unlikely that the point mutation causes a gross conformational change in class I molecules, we used the HLA-G/E114H mutant in parallel with wild-type HLA-G as a control for the tapasin-independent phenotype. To investigate the mechanism by which tapasin affects surface expression of HLA-G, we compared the intracellular maturation and transport of HLA-G in the 721.220 and 721.220.Tpn cells. In the absence of tapasin, 50% of HLA-G heavy chains remained sensitive to endo-H digestion, even after 8 h (Fig. 1B), reflecting retention of these molecules in the ER. Conversely, in the presence of tapasin, most HLA-G molecules had become endo-H-resistant by this time (Fig. 1B). These findings suggest that the impaired intracellular transport of HLA-G molecules in the absence of tapasin accounts for their low levels of surface expression. Pulse-chase experiments from tapasin-negative and -positive cells revealed comparable acquisition of endo-H resistance by HLA-G/E114H (Fig.1C), indicating its tapasin independence for normal intracellular transport. We have shown that the availability of high affinity peptides dictates the transport kinetics of HLA-G (19Park B. Lee S. Kim E. Chang S. Jin M. Ahn K. Immunity. 2001; 15: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To determine whether the inefficient transport of HLA-G in the absence of tapasin can be overcome by supplying high affinity peptides, we examined the intracellular trafficking of HLA-G and HLA-G/E114H upon expression of high affinity peptides by the minigene expression system. The minigene encoding MIPAQFYIL, a high affinity peptide ligand for HLA-G (23Diehl M. Munz C. Keilholz W. Stevanovic S. Holmes N. Loke Y.W. Rammensee H.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 305-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), was co-expressed with the gene encoding either HLA-G or HLA-G/E114H in 721.220 and 721.220.Tpn cells. In the presence of tapasin, no discernible difference in the transport rate between HLA-G and HLA-G/E114H was seen upon expression of high affinity peptides (Fig.1D), but both HLA-G and HLA-G/E114H molecules were transported with much faster kinetics when compared with the kinetics of molecules without the supply of high affinity peptides (Fig. 1,B and C, right). In the absence of tapasin, the supply of high affinity peptides increased the transport kinetics of HLA-G/E114H (Fig. 1, compare C (left) and E (right)), whereas this supply did not influence the transport kinetics of HLA-G (Fig. 1, compare B(right) and E (left)). These results indicate that for efficient intracellular transport of HLA-G molecules, an abundance of high affinity peptides cannot compensate for the lack of tapasin. In the absence of tapasin, the impaired intracellular transport and the low surface expression of HLA-G might be due to its inability to load high affinity peptides. To test this possibility, we examined peptide loading into HLA-G or HLA-G/E114H molecules as a function of tapasin by using the reporter peptide, KIPAQFYIL, which is known to be a high affinity ligand for HLA-G (23Diehl M. Munz C. Keilholz W. Stevanovic S. Holmes N. Loke Y.W. Rammensee H.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 305-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), in the presence of the competitors at different concentrations. We were surprised at the marked differences in the ability of HLA-G and HLA-G/E114H to load peptides in the absence of tapasin. In the case of no competitor added, the level of binding of the reporter peptide by HLA-G was only 25% of the binding observed in the HLA-G/E114H substitution mutant (Fig.2A). Furthermore, the reporter peptides loaded into HLA-G were completely outcompeted by a lower concentration (1.6 μm) of unlabeled peptide, whereas as much as 6.4 μm of unlabeled peptide was not sufficient for completely outcompeting reporter peptide binding to HLA-G/E114H. However, in the presence of tapasin, no discernible difference in the peptide binding ability of HLA-G and HLA-G/E114H was seen (Fig.2B). These results indicate that HLA-G molecules are highly dependent on tapasin for efficient loading with high affinity peptides, but the substitution of glutamic acid to histidine at position 114 renders the molecules independent of tapasin for high affinity peptide loading. Accordingly, the impaired intracellular transport and reduced surface expression of HLA-G in the absence of tapasin are probably the result of the inadequacy of HLA-G for high affinity peptide loading. To test whether the differential peptide loading observed in the absence of tapasin might be due to differences in the luminal availability of the peptide, we quantitated the amount of reporter peptides that were translocated into the ER lumen. Comparable amounts of peptides were recovered between HLA-G and HLA-G/E114H (Fig.2C). Therefore, we exclude the notion that luminal availability of the peptide plays an important role in dictating class I loading in tapasin-deficient cells. In control experiments in which ATP was omitted, little peptide was recovered. Since peptide translocation via TAP requires ATP (27Jun Y. Kim E. Jin M. Sung H.C. Han H. Geraghty D.E. Ahn K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we conclude that the modified reporter peptides entered the ER lumen in a TAP-dependent manner. HLA-G molecules that are loaded with peptides of suboptimal affinity are retrieved back to the ER. Loading of HLA-G with high affinity peptides abrogates this retrieval and allows HLA-G-peptide complexes to transport forward to the cell surface (19Park B. Lee S. Kim E. Chang S. Jin M. Ahn K. Immunity. 2001; 15: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To examine whether tapasin affects the recycling behavior of HLA-G as a function of the availability of high affinity peptides, we stably expressed minigenes encoding MIPAQFYIL in NIH3T3.hβ2m cells and NIH3T3.hβ2m.hTpn cells and then treated cells with nocodazole. Nocodazole disrupts microtubules, leading to disintegration of the Golgi and interruption of traffic between the Golgi and the ER (28Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.G. Hauri H.P. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). On the basis of cell size and ease of manipulation, we used NIH3T3 cells for the immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy experiments throughout the study. In the absence of high affinity peptides, in nocodazole-treated cells, both HLA-G and HLA-G/E114H exhibited the punctate staining pattern around the perinuclear region regardless of tapasin (Fig.3, A and B), an indication of recycling.

Amino acid sequence analysis of these families establishes three important characteristics: (i) propeptides are almost always less conserved than their cognate catalytic domains, (ii) they contain a large number of charged amino acids, and (iii) propeptides within different protease families display insignificant sequence similarity. The implications of these findings are, however, unclear. In this study, we have used subtilisin as our model to redesign a peptide chaperone using information databases. Our goal was to establish the minimum sequence requirements for a functional subtilisin propeptide, because such information could facilitate subsequent design of tailor-made chaperones. A decision-based computer algorithm that maintained conserved residues but varied all non-conserved residues from a multiple protein sequence alignment was developed and utilized to design a novel peptide sequence (ProD). Interestingly, despite a difference of 5 pH units between their isoelectric points and despite displaying only 16% sequence identity with the wild-type propeptide (ProWT), ProD chaperones folding and functions as a potent subtilisin inhibitor. The computed secondary structures and hydrophobic patterns within these two propeptides are similar. However, unlike ProWT, ProD adopts a well defined α−β conformation as an isolated peptide and forms a stoichiometric complex with mature subtilisin. The CD spectra of this complex is similar to ProWT·subtilisin.

This functional conservation across unrelated protease families suggests that propeptides have evolved in multiple parallel pathways and may share a common mechanism of action (9Eder J. Fersht A.

Bacterial subtilisins are models for the subtilase family that spans prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Amino acid sequence analysis of this family establishes that although the subtilisin domain is conserved, the cognate propeptides can vary significantly (8Shinde U.P. Inouye M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because propeptides perform functions different from the catalytic domains, they may be subjected to different mutational frequencies because of different functional constraints (14Miyata T. Yasunaga T. J. Mol. Evol. 1980; 16: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 15Li W.-H. Lu C.-C. Wu C.-I. MacIntyre R.J. Molecular Evolutionary Genetics.

However, given that they impart structural information to their catalytic domains (17Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 18Shinde U.P. Fu X. Inouye M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39213-39222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), propeptides within one family could adopt similar structural scaffolds despite digressions in their polypeptide sequences. This makes propeptides attractive models for protein redesign and for understanding the relation between sequence and structure.To establish minimum sequence requirements for a functional propeptide, in this study we have designed and developed a peptide chaperone using information databases on the subtilase family. This family is ideal because enormous structural and functional information on individual members is already available (8Shinde U.P. Inouye M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The peptide sequence (ProD)1 was designed through a decision-based computer algorithm that maintained conserved residues but varied all non-conserved residues from a multiple protein sequence alignment. The DNA sequence coding for ProD was synthesized and subsequently expressed in Escherichia coli, and the resulting peptide was purified. Despite a difference of 5 pH units between their isoelectric points (pI) and despite displaying only 16% sequence identity with the wild-type propeptide (ProWT), ProD chaperones folding and functions as a potent subtilisin inhibitor. The computed two-dimensional structure and the distribution of hydrophobic residues within these two propeptides are similar. However, unlike ProWT, ProD adopts a well defined α-β conformation as an isolated peptide. The CD structure of ProD·subtilisin was found to be similar to ProWT·subtilisin. Hence, despite low sequence identity and opposite net charge, ProD and ProWT adopt similar structural scaffolds. Our results suggest conserved structural scaffolds and hydrophobicity, but not absolute charge, dictates propeptide function.DISCUSSIONWe have used the subtilase family as a model to analyze the relation between sequence, charge, structure, and function within propeptides. An indigenously developed algorithm provided a novel peptide, ProD, that displays only 16% sequence identity and has a pI 5 pH units lower than ProWT (Table I). However, the overall hydrophobic patterns, the computed secondary structures, and the potential folding nucleation motifs (N1 and N2) appear to be conserved in ProD (Fig. 1,A–C). These properties seem to be important for function because, despite low sequence identity, ProD and ProWT can function as peptide chaperones and potent protease inhibitors (Fig. 2, Aand B). However, ProD is a less efficient chaperone and a more potent inhibitor than ProWT. This confirms that the chaperone and inhibitory functions are not obligatorily related (22Fu X.F. Inouye M. Shinde U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16871-16878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The differences in the amino acid composition are also reflected in the secondary structures of the isolated ProWT and ProD measured using CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3A). Unlike ProWT, ProD adopts a well defined α-β conformation as an isolated peptide and can form a stoichiometric complex with mature subtilisin. The CD spectra of these two complexes are similar and suggest that ProD and ProWT adopt similar structural scaffolds. Based on our results, we propose that the chaperoning activity of the propeptide of the subtilisin family appears to be encoded in the ability to adopt a specific conformation.It is important to note that although the sequence similarity between ProWT and ProD is low, the sequence similarity of the residues that form interface with subtilisin (as judged by three-dimensional structure 1SCJ) is at least 70%. As a result, one would expect the net binding energy of ProWT and ProD to subtilisin to be very similar. However, in the case of ProWT its binding to subtilisin is coupled to its folding. Hence a part of the interaction energy will be spent on ProWT folding, thereby lowering the ProWT-subtilisin affinity (or inhibition constant). The ProD is already folded; it does not need to expend as much energy on its folding when compared with ProWT. This in turn may result in a higher affinity and hence a 10-fold tighter inhibition constant.Because propeptide domains appear to have emerged through convergent evolution (9Eder J. Fersht A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), this raises another important question. Are there common structural features that define propeptide function in different protein families? To examine this possibility we compared the structures of the propeptides from subtilisin (PDB identifier, 1SCJ), α-lytic protease (1P02), and carboxypeptidase B (1KWM). Fig.5A suggests that all three proteins display similar structural scaffolds despite there being no sequence and structural similarities between their cognate protease domains (31Baker D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1021-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, potent subtilisin inhibitors (chymotrypsin inhibitor II (2SNI), streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (3SSI), and eglin C (1CSE)) that have no known chaperone function also display similar structural scaffolds without any sequence similarity (Fig.5B). Does this structural similarity imply a common evolutionary domain? In other words, have propeptides emerged from a primordial protease inhibitor? The conservation of the structural scaffold in ProD, a chaperone designed to digress from the ProWT sequence while maintaining function, suggests that the ability to adopt a specific α-β conformation along with certain specific interactions appears to be crucial for propeptide function. These functions are to chaperone and to inhibit the protease domain. We suggest that the structural scaffold may contribute to the inhibitory function and certain residue specific interactions may be important for its chaperone function. Such specific interactions may be provided by motifs N1 and N2 in the subtilase family and may vary between families. Although the structural similarities are striking in Fig. 5,A and B, it is also possible that they are purely co-incidental.The functional conservation in ProD, although having a difference of 5 pH units, suggests that charge per se may not be important for propeptide function. So why is there a large bias for charge in propeptide domains? Also, if the propeptides within a family adopt similar structures and perform similar functions, why do the primary sequences of propeptide diverge faster than their cognate catalytic domains? One possibility is that the charged N terminus increases the solubility of the precursor protein. Another possibility is that the environment in which these proteins are required to become active influences sequence digressions. For example, subtilisin is secreted out by B. subtilis for the purpose of scavenging food, whereas mammalian cells secrete the eukaryotic subtilisin homologue furin into the trans Golgi network for processing precursor proteins (32Anderson E.D. Molloy S.S. Jean F. Fei H. Shimamura S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12879-12890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although the catalytic domains of bacterial subtilisin and their eukaryotic counterparts are similar and robustly stable (8Shinde U.P. Inouye M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the propeptides in the above example are removed in dramatically different environments (4Yabuta Y. Takagi H. Inouye M. Shinde U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44427-44433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We propose that the amino acid differences between their propeptides allow these proteins to respond to different environments to modulate activation precision of proteases. Another noteworthy point is that our work raises questions regarding the lower limit for sequence identity that is acceptable for two proteins to perform similar functions. Subtilisin E is an alkaline serine protease isolated fromBacillus subtilis (1Wong S.L. Doi R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10176-10181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1021-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, potent subtilisin inhibitors (chymotrypsin inhibitor II (2SNI), streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (3SSI), and eglin C (1CSE)) that have no known chaperone function also display similar structural scaffolds without any sequence similarity (Fig.5B). Does this structural similarity imply a common evolutionary domain? In other words, have propeptides emerged from a primordial protease inhibitor? The conservation of the structural scaffold in ProD, a chaperone designed to digress from the ProWT sequence while maintaining function, suggests that the ability to adopt a specific α-β conformation along with certain specific interactions appears to be crucial for propeptide function. These functions are to chaperone and to inhibit the protease domain. We suggest that the structural scaffold may contribute to the inhibitory function and certain residue specific interactions may be important for its chaperone function. Such specific interactions may be provided by motifs N1 and N2 in the subtilase family and may vary between families. Although the structural similarities are striking in Fig. 5,A and B, it is also possible that they are purely co-incidental.The functional conservation in ProD, although having a difference of 5 pH units, suggests that charge per se may not be important for propeptide function. So why is there a large bias for charge in propeptide domains? Also, if the propeptides within a family adopt similar structures and perform similar functions, why do the primary sequences of propeptide diverge faster than their cognate catalytic domains? One possibility is that the charged N terminus increases the solubility of the precursor protein. Another possibility is that the environment in which these proteins are required to become active influences sequence digressions. For example, subtilisin is secreted out by B. subtilis for the purpose of scavenging food, whereas mammalian cells secrete the eukaryotic subtilisin homologue furin into the trans Golgi network for processing precursor proteins (32Anderson E.D. Molloy S.S. Jean F. Fei H. Shimamura S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12879-12890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although the catalytic domains of bacterial subtilisin and their eukaryotic counterparts are similar and robustly stable (8Shinde U.P. Inouye M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the propeptides in the above example are removed in dramatically different environments (4Yabuta Y. Takagi H. Inouye M. Shinde U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44427-44433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We propose that the amino acid differences between their propeptides allow these proteins to respond to different environments to modulate activation precision of proteases. Another noteworthy point is that our work raises questions regarding the lower limit for sequence identity that is acceptable for two proteins to perform similar functions. We have used the subtilase family as a model to analyze the relation between sequence, charge, structure, and function within propeptides. An indigenously developed algorithm provided a novel peptide, ProD, that displays only 16% sequence identity and has a pI 5 pH units lower than ProWT (Table I). However, the overall hydrophobic patterns, the computed secondary structures, and the potential folding nucleation motifs (N1 and N2) appear to be conserved in ProD (Fig. 1,A–C). These properties seem to be important for function because, despite low sequence identity, ProD and ProWT can function as peptide chaperones and potent protease inhibitors (Fig. 2, Aand B). However, ProD is a less efficient chaperone and a more potent inhibitor than ProWT. This confirms that the chaperone and inhibitory functions are not obligatorily related (22Fu X.F. Inouye M. Shinde U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16871-16878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The differences in the amino acid composition are also reflected in the secondary structures of the isolated ProWT and ProD measured using CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3A). Unlike ProWT, ProD adopts a well defined α-β conformation as an isolated peptide and can form a stoichiometric complex with mature subtilisin. The CD spectra of these two complexes are similar and suggest that ProD and ProWT adopt similar structural scaffolds. Based on our results, we propose that the chaperoning activity of the propeptide of the subtilisin family appears to be encoded in the ability to adopt a specific conformation. It is important to note that although the sequence similarity between ProWT and ProD is low, the sequence similarity of the residues that form interface with subtilisin (as judged by three-dimensional structure 1SCJ) is at least 70%. As a result, one would expect the net binding energy of ProWT and ProD to subtilisin to be very similar. However, in the case of ProWT its binding to subtilisin is coupled to its folding. Hence a part of the interaction energy will be spent on ProWT folding, thereby lowering the ProWT-subtilisin affinity (or inhibition constant). The ProD is already folded; it does not need to expend as much energy on its folding when compared with ProWT. This in turn may result in a higher affinity and hence a 10-fold tighter inhibition constant. Because propeptide domains appear to have emerged through convergent evolution (9Eder J. Fersht A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), this raises another important question. Are there common structural features that define propeptide function in different protein families?

Res. 2002; 90: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a distinguishing functional feature that discriminates pacemaker channels from the Kv counterparts is their signature “backward” gating (i.e. activation upon hyperpolarization rather than depolarization). The molecular basis of this unique gating phenotype is unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that the voltage-sensing mechanism of the sea urchin sperm HCN (i.e. SPIH or spHCN) and Kv channels may be conserved (11Mannikko R. Elinder F. Larsson H.P. Nature. 2002; 419: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In any case, the structure-function correlation of HCN channels is much less defined compared with the well studied Kv channels. Comparison of these related yet functionally distinct ion channels should provide important insights into the unique behavior of HCN channels. hyperpolarization-activated cyclicnucleotide-gated voltage-gated K+ wild-type methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium Previous studies of Kv channels have demonstrated that the S3-S4 linker influences activation gating (12Gonzalez C. Rosenman E. Bezanilla F. Alvarez O. Latorre R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Gonzalez C. Rosenman E. Bezanilla F. Alvarez O. Latorre R. Proc. Natl.

By analogy to Kv channels, it is possible that the S3-S4 linker (defined as residues 229–237 here, HCN1 numbering) of HCN channels also contributes to activation gating. However, this idea has not been tested. In this study, we probed the functional importance of the S3-S4 linker of HCN1 channels by multiple substitutions of its residues. We found that the acidic linker residue Glu235, conserved among all known hyperpolarization-activated channels (Fig.1), prominently influences HCN gating. Glu235 is also largely responsible for the charge-shielding effects of external Mg2+. Novel insights into the structural and functional roles of the S3-S4 linker of HCN channels are discussed. A preliminary report has appeared (16Henrikson C.A. Dong P. Marban E. Li R.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: II-226Google Scholar). Mouse HCN1 (kindly provided by Drs. S. A. Siegelbaum and B. Santoro) was subcloned into the pGHE expression vector (9Santoro B. Liu D.T. Yao H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Mutations were created using PCR with overlapping mutagenic primers. The desired mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. cRNA was transcribed fromNheI-linearized DNA using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). HCN1 channel constructs were heterologously expressed and studied in Xenopus oocytes. Briefly, stage IV–VI oocytes were surgically removed from female frogs anesthetized by immersion in 0.3% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, followed by digestion with 1 mg/ml collagenase (type IA) in OR-2 containing 88 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) for 30–60 min. Isolated oocytes were injected with cRNA (50 or 100 ng/cell) and stored in 96 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 5 mm pyruvate, and 0.5 mm theophylline. Two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings were performed at room temperature (23–25 °C) using a Warner OC-725B amplifier 1–2 days after cRNA injection as described (10Xue T. Marban E. Li R.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because Xenopusoocytes are essentially a mass of yolk surrounded by an outer fenestrated membrane, membrane potential could be accurately measured only to within approximately ±2 mV. Furthermore, it was assumed that ion conductance had reached steady-state under our experimental conditions. The regular recording bath solution contained 97.8 mm KCl, 2 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.5). The MgCl2concentration was increased in certain experiments as indicated. The voltage dependence of HCN channel activation was assessed by plotting tail currents measured immediately after pulsing to −140 mV as a function of the preceding 3-s test pulse voltage normalized to the maximum tail current recorded. Data were fit to the Boltzmann functions using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm in a nonlinear least-squares procedure: m∞ = 1/(1 + exp((Vt − V½)/k)), where Vt is the test potential;V½ is the half-point of the relationship; andk = RT/zF is the slope factor, where R, T, z, and F have their usual meanings. Changes in free energy (ΔΔG) associated with steady-state activation shifts caused by amino acid substitution were calculated using the following equation: ΔΔG =RT(V½(mutant)/k(mutant)−V½(WT)/kWT). For simplification of kinetic analysis, the time constants for activation (τact) and deactivation (τdeact) were estimated by fitting macroscopic and tail currents, respectively, with a monoexponential function. However, it should be noted that the onset of HCN1 currents shows sigmoidicity and that tail currents also exhibited an initial delay. The mechanism underlying such complex kinetic behavior of HCN channels is not understood; further analysis using multiple exponential components was beyond the scope of the this study. For estimating open and closed rates of channels, the bell-shaped distribution of τact and τdeactwas fitted to the following relation: τ = 1/(α0e−Vm/Vo+ β0eVm/Vo), where α0 and β0 reflect the open and closed rates at zero voltage, respectively. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using unpaired Student'st test with p < 0.05 representing significance. We first characterized wild-type (WT) HCN1 channels by examining their activation gating properties. Stepping the transmembrane potential to voltages below −40 mV activated typical time-dependent inward currents whose time constants (τact) became faster with progressive hyperpolarization (Fig. 2, A and D). The midpoint (V½) and slope factor (k) derived from the steady-state activation curve were −70.6 ± 0.7 mV and 9.5 ± 0.5 (n = 6), respectively (Fig.2B). We also studied the deactivation properties of WT channels by examining the voltage dependence of the rate of tail current decay following maximum channel opening by hyperpolarizing to −140 mV (Fig. 2, C and D). Unlike τact, the deactivation time constant (τdeact) became faster with increasing depolarization. Plotting these time constants together against the test potential revealed that the voltage dependence of τact and τdeact had a bell-shaped form (Fig. 2D); α0 and β0 for WT HCN1 channels derived from this curve were (3.6 ± 0.5) × 10−1 and (2.3 ± 0.2) × 10 s−1, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). The peak of the τ curve coincided with the steady-state activation midpoint. To investigate the functional roles of the S3-S4 linker in HCN1 activation, we first mutated Glu235, an acidic residue conserved in all hyperpolarization-activated channels (cf.Fig. 1), to Ala and Arg for net charge changes of +1 and +2 at this channel site, respectively. The charge-neutralized substitution E235A produced a significant depolarizing shift in steady-state channel activation without altering the slope factor (Fig.3C; see also Fig. 4). Interestingly, the charge-reversed mutation E235R shifted activation even more positively (Fig. 3D), highly suggestive of an electrostatic role of residue 235. Similar to E235A, the slope factor of E235R channels was also not altered (Figs. 3D and4C).Figure 4Effects of various Glu235mutations on HCN1 activation gating.

Band C, summary of steady-state activation midpoints and slope factors, respectively, of various Glu235 mutants (i.e. E235D, E235A, E235P, E235H, E235R, and E235K).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because HCN channels are not embedded in the membrane in an orientation opposite to that of depolarization-activated channels (17Xue T. Li R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46233-46242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the S3-S4 linker should be on the extracellular side. We hypothesized that if Glu235 is externally accessible and its effects on channel activation are electrostatic, screening surface charges should effectively shield its anionic charge and thereby produce activation shifts similar to those observed with the E235A and E235R mutants. Consistent with this notion, increasing external Mg2+ gradually shifted steady-state activation in the depolarizing direction (V½= 70.6 ± 0.7 mV (n = 6), −68.9 ± 1.1 mV (n = 3), −66.0 ± 0.4 mV (n = 3), and −60.1 ± 1.5 mV (n = 8) for 1, 3, 10, and 30 mm Mg2+, respectively) (Fig. 3B), mimicking the progressive rightward shifts caused by mutations E235A and E235R. As extra support for the external electrostatic role of residue 235, Fig. 3 (C and D) shows that the response of E235A and E235R channels to Mg2+ was significantly attenuated. 30 mm Mg2+ induced only a 7.9 ± 1.2 mV (n = 5) depolarizing shift of the steady-state activation midpoint for E235A channels (versus ΔV½ = 11.3 ± 0.9 mV (n = 8) for WT channels; p < 0.05), whereas that for E235R channels was virtually not shifted at all (ΔV½ = 3.3 ± 1.4 mV (n = 3); p > 0.05), as if surface charges were already shielded. Activation shifts of WT, E235A, and E235R HCN1 channels caused by 30 mm Mg2+ are summarized and compared in Fig. 3E. If the S3-S4 linker residue Glu235 influences HCN1 activation by electrostatic means, substitutions of residue 235 by amino acids other than Ala and Arg that also render its charge neutralized or reversed should produce rightward activation shifts similar to those of E235A and E235R channels. In complete accordance with this notion, the activation midpoints of E235K, E235H, and E235P channels were all displaced in the depolarizing direction (Fig. 4B). The charge-reversed mutations (E235R, E235K, and E235H) generally produced more pronounced activation shifts than did the charge-neutralized counterparts (E235P and E235A), although E235P was more positively shifted than E235H. In contrast to these charge-altered substitutions, the charge-conserved substitution E235D displayed gating properties indistinguishable from those of WT channels. None of the Glu235 mutations significantly altered the slope factor (p > 0.05) (Fig.4C). To determine whether a correlation between steady-state activation and the charge of residue 235 (Q235) exists, we plotted the energetic changes (ΔΔG) associated with the activation shifts resulting from the various substitutions studied relative to WT channels (i.e. Glu235) against their own charges. Fig. 5Aindicates that ΔΔG and Q235 were linearly correlated (r = 0.94) with a slope dependence of 2.1 ± 0.3 kcal/mol/charge. Taken collectively, our results were consistent with an external electrostatic role of residue 235. In comparison with WT channels, all Glu235 mutants displayed bell-shaped τ curves, except with peaks shifted in the depolarizing direction that paralleled the corresponding ΔV½(see Fig. 5B (inset) for an example). Neither α0 nor β0 (derived from τ curves) displayed any obvious correlation with the charge of residue 235. Fig.5B shows that, whereas β0 was not affected by the side chain volume at all, there was a trend that α0tended to accelerate with increasing side chain bulk, but the correlation was weak (r = 0.44). We also investigated the effects of substituting another anionic residue, Asp233, within the same linker (cf. Fig. 1). In contrast to Glu235mutations, however, none of the D233A, D233G, D233E, and D233R channels exhibited gating properties different from those of WT HCN1 (Fig.6, A–C) despite the close proximity of residues 233 and 235. These results indicate that the functional changes observed with Glu235 substitutions are site-specific. We also probed the external accessibility of residue 233 by examining the sensitivity of D233C channels (in the background of C318S to eliminate the intrinsic sensitivity of WT channels to MTS compounds) (17Xue T. Li R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46233-46242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) to the hydrophilic sulfhydryl modifier MTSEA. Like C318S channels, D233C/C318S channels were not reactive to external application of 2.5 mm MTSEA (Fig.6D). E235C/C318S did not lead to functional expression of measurable currents, rendering the assessment of its sensitivity to MTS agents not possible. Combining the S3-S4 linker mutations D233A and E235A with the S4-S5 linker substitution W270A, whose equivalent mutation in HCN2 (i.e. W323A) is known to shift activation positively (18Chen J. Mitcheson J.S. Tristani-Firouzi M. Lin M. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11277-11282Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), produced an activation shift more positive than either of the individual mutations, indicating that the effects from these single substitutions were largely additive (Fig.7). These results suggest that the external S3-S4 linker and the cytoplasmic S4-S5 linker are likely to exert their effects on activation via mechanisms that are independent of each other.Figure 7Effects of W270A and D233A/E235A/W270A on HCN1 activation gating.

W270A alone already produced significant depolarizing activation shifts compared with WT channels.

A. 1994; 91: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the S3-S4 linker of HCN channels also influences activation gating. The charge-neutralizing and charge-reversing mutations of linker residue 235 positively shifted steady-state activation in a charge-dependent fashion (as reflected by the linear ΔΔG versus Q235 relationship). Surface charge shielding by external Mg2+ mimics our charge-changing mutations by shifting the WT activation curve in the depolarizing direction; such Mg2+-induced shifts were reduced by mutation E235A, as if the channels were already partially screened by this charge-neutralized substitution. The charge-screening effects of Mg2+ were further attenuated by E235R, although there was a modest residual response (ΔV½ ∼ 3 mV) to the addition of 30 mm Mg2+. Although the activation shift and the decreased Mg2+ effect caused by the neutralization of Glu235 could be most easily explained by residue 235 functioning as a surface charge, the additional decreased Mg2+ effect caused by the charge-reversed E235R mutation could result from the screening of an additional negative surface charge of the channel by the substituted arginine. Indeed, this notion is consistent with our finding that neutralizing Glu235eliminated ∼50% of the Mg2+ effect and that Mg2+ can screen only negative surface charges. Further studies are required to identify this additional endogenous surface charge. Theoretically, change of a surface charge should produce concomitant shifts in the voltage dependence of both steady-state activation and gating kinetics. Indeed, this was observed with our Glu235 mutants (Fig. 5B, inset), consistent with the effect of a surface charge. Taken collectively, our results suggest that Glu235 is largely responsible for the surface charge-shielding effects of Mg2+, probably at an externally accessible position (although the Mg2+ effects could be indirect). Interestingly, the attenuated charge-screening effects of external Mg2+ on Glu235 mutant channels mirror the abolition of surface charge-shielding effects of H+ observed with the Shaker mutant, whose S3-S4 linker (including the acidic residues Glu333, Glu334, Glu335, and Asp336) has been deleted (14Sorensen J.B. Cha A. Latorre R. Rosenman E. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, it is tempting to speculate that the S3-S4 linker of HCN1 channels does not undergo significant conformational changes during activation (e.g. movements in the direction opposite to that of the positively charged S4) (15Mathur R. Zheng J. Yan Y. Sigworth F.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) because of its apparent lack of contribution to the effective gating charge (as reflected by the relatively unchanged slope factors of Glu235 mutants). Because Glu235 is separated by only two residues from the first basic S4 residue (i.e.Lys238), this native glutamate may serve as a surface charge that influences HCN activation by shaping the local electric field sensed by the positively charged S4 (thereby shifting the steady-state V½). Theoretically, neutralization of a negative surface charge will always have the same effect, independent of the voltage-sensing mechanism, by altering the transmembrane voltage gradient: the voltage dependence should be shifted to more depolarized potentials such that a stronger depolarization will restore the original voltage profile. In this regard, the S3-S4 linker does not need to directly participate in gating to exert its effects. However, based on the data presented, we cannot exclude the possibility that the S3-S4 linker could undergo major conformational changes (e.g. horizontal movements would not alter the slope factor). Although α0 and β0 of HCN1 were not drastically altered by Glu235 mutations, other S3-S4 linker residues may alter the energy barriers separating the channel transitions required for channel openings (i.e. gating kinetics). Clearly, additional experiments are needed to further explore the functional role of this channel region. It should be noted that the gating parameters studied here can also be modulated by other mechanisms. For instance, it has been demonstrated that cAMP binding to the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain of HCN channels shifts the voltage dependence of steady-state activation to more depolarizing potentials and accelerates activation kinetics by relieving an intrinsic inhibitory influence of the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain on basal gating (20Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Although mutating the S3-S4 linker and/or Mg2+ application may have indirect or long-range allosteric effects on this modulatory mechanism, it is reassuring that a highly correlated linear relationship was observed with multiple Glu235 mutations carrying different charges; indeed, the isoform used in our study, HCN1, is less sensitive to allosteric modulation by the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain than HCN2 (8Ludwig A.

Although Glu235 is likely to influence activation gating by acting as an external surface charge of the channel, none of the Asp233 mutations studied altered HCN gating properties. Furthermore, Asp233 was not externally accessible, although it is possible that Cys233 was successfully modified, but without functional changes. These observations could be readily explained by assuming that the HCN S3-S4 linker also forms a helical structure. Such an arrangement of S3-S4 linker residues would place Asp233 on a side of the helix opposite to that of Glu235, shielding the aspartate side chain from the S4 voltage sensor. Alternatively, Asp233 could be farther away from the S4 segment, thereby minimizing the effects of charge neutralization at this channel site. Clearly, additional experiments are needed to distinguish between these possibilities. Previous studies with depolarization-activated K+ channels have established that channel regions other than the S4 segments are also involved in the process of voltage sensing (25Papazian D.M.

Although deletion of the S3-S4 linker in Kv channels slows gating kinetics, voltage-dependent movements of S4 remain (12Gonzalez C. Rosenman E. Bezanilla F. Alvarez O. Latorre R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This finding led to the conclusion that S4 moves only a short distance during activation, although many other experiments suggest that S4 translocates a large distance during the process of activation gating (23Glauner K.S. Mannuzzu L.M. Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. Nature. 1999; 402: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 24Elinder F. Mannikko R. Larsson H.P. J. Gen.

Indeed, it is possible that S4 undergoes voltage-dependent movements without requiring linker motion (15Mathur R. Zheng J. Yan Y. Sigworth F.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Despite these discrepancies, the consensus is that S4 moves outward upon depolarization to induce channel opening of Kv channels (and also other depolarization-activated channels). Using sulfhydryl modification of cysteine-substituted sea urchin sperm SPIH mutant channels, Larsson and co-workers (11Mannikko R. Elinder F. Larsson H.P. Nature. 2002; 419: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) recently provided evidence that the voltage-sensing mechanism of Kv channels is also conserved in this hyperpolarization-activated channel (i.e. outward movements of S4 upon depolarization). Because the voltage-sensing mechanisms are conserved between depolarization- and hyperpolarization-activated channels, the mechanisms that couple the voltage sensor and the activation gate must be different. Although the present study did not address the molecular mechanism underlying the difference in coupling that contributes to the backward gating phenotype of HCN channels, emerging evidence appears to support the notion that Kv and HCN channels share significant structural and functional similarities, e.g. both are tetramers whose fundamental building blocks are six-transmembrane subunits (7Gauss R.

In the effector state, CD8+ T cells acquire cytolytic activity and produce increased levels of cytokines such as interferon-γ. They also exhibit increased T cell receptor sensitivity, decreased CD28 dependence, and become inhibitable by CTLA-4 and other negative regulatory pathways. We hypothesized that one mechanism by which these two states are regulated is via differential expression of specific genes. To this end, basal gene expression profiles of naı̈ve and effector 2C TCR transgenic x RAG2−/− CD8+ T cells were analyzed using Affymetrix arrays representing 11,000 genes. Of the 177 differentially expressed known genes, 68 were expressed at higher levels in effector cells, but 109 were more abundant in naı̈ve cells, supporting the notion that the naive state is not passive. Expression of genes related to metabolism, actin cytoskeletal dynamics, and effector function increased with priming, whereas expression of putative anti-proliferative genes decreased. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR was utilized as a secondary validation for selected transcripts, and Western blot analysis was used to examine protein expression for molecules of interest. Surprisingly, for 24 genes examined, 12 showed discordant protein versus mRNA expression. In summary, our study indicates that: 1) not only does the expression of some genes in naive CD8+ T cells become up-regulated upon priming, but the expression of other genes is down-regulated as well and 2) the complexities of T cell differentiation include regulation at the post-transcriptional level.

The engagement of TCRs1 by peptide/major histocompatibility complexes in conjunction with costimulatory ligands initiates signaling events leading to IL-2 production, cell cycle progression, and differentiation into effector cells. The differentiation fate of T cells undergoing activation is also influenced by exogenous cytokines. For CD4+ T cells, IL-12 and IL-4 promote T helper 1 and 2 differentiation, respectively (1O'Garra A. Arai N.

For CD8+ T cells, although T cytotoxic 1 and 2 phenotypes can be similarly induced, priming with TCR and CD28 ligation in the absence of cytokines is sufficient to promote differentiation into cytolytic effector cells that produce IFN-γ (6Cronin II, D.C. Lancki D.W. Fitch F.W. Immunol. Res. 1994; 13: 215-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Acquisition of lytic activity by CD8+ cells also requires cell cycle progression (6Cronin II, D.C.

In addition to the development of cytolytic activity and cytokine-producing capacity, effector CD8+ T cells exhibit several additional functional alterations compared with naı̈ve CD8+ T cells. Effector cells exhibit a lower threshold for TCR-mediated signaling (7Iezzi G. Karjalainen K. Lanzavecchia A.

Thus, the primed effector CD8+phenotype is rather complex and extends beyond effector functionper se. Although the naı̈ve T cell state may have previously been viewed as “quiescent” and relatively inert, two lines of recent data have begun to change that perspective. First, several investigators have demonstrated that signaling through the TCR from self peptide/class I major histocompatibility complexes is necessary to maintain the survival of naı̈ve CD8+ T cells in the periphery (19Tanchot C. Lemonnier F.A. Perarnau B. Freitas A.A. Rocha B. Science. 1997; 276: 2057-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Thus, the prevention of apoptotic death in naı̈ve cells is an active process. Second, the transcription factor LKLF has been shown to be preferentially expressed in naı̈ve T cells and down-regulated after activation (20Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Leiden J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 1986-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 21Teague T.K. Hildeman D. Kedl R.M. Mitchell T. Rees W. Schaefer B.C. Bender J. Kappler J. Marrack P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nature. 2000; 403: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In mice, post-thymic LKLF-deficient T cells fail to enter a naı̈ve resting state and rapidly die (23Kuo C.T. Leiden J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 149-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), suggesting that the naı̈ve state may need to be actively maintained. We hypothesized that many of the functional distinctions between naı̈ve and effector CD8+ T cells may be explained by differential expression of specific genes. To approach this hypothesis, a gene array strategy was pursued using naı̈ve and 5-day-primed 2C TCR transgenic x RAG2−/− CD8+ T cells. Of 11,000 genes represented, ∼177 known genes were differentially expressed. Counter to expectations, approximately half of the differentially expressed genes were present at decreased levels in effector cells, supporting the notion that the naı̈ve state is not inert. RNA expression of genes related to metabolism, actin cytoskeletal dynamics, and T cell effector function increased with priming. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was utilized as a secondary validation for selected transcripts, and Western blot analysis was used as a tertiary validation for molecules of interest. However, although differential protein expression correlated with differential RNA expression in some instances, this was not observed for many signaling molecules and transcription factors. Comparable RNA but increased protein levels, or decreased RNA with comparable or increased protein levels, were frequently observed. These results suggest that post-transcriptional events, such as regulated translation, protein stability, and post-translational modification, may be common and are likely to contribute to the control of peripheral T cell differentiation. 2C/RAG2−/− mice have been described (9Fields P.E. Finch R.J. Gray G.S. Zollner R. Thomas J.L. Sturmhoefel K. Lee K. Wolf S. Gajewski T.F. Fitch F.W. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5268-5275PubMed Google Scholar). Naı̈ve 2C/RAG2−/− CD8+ T cells were isolated using a negative selection protocol. Spleens from 2C/RAG2−/− mice were macerated and washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 107 fetal calf serum. CD8+ T cells were enriched using StemSepTMEnrichment Mixture for murine CD8+ T cells (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate primed cells, 105freshly purified 2C/RAG2−/− CD8+ T cells were plated with 5 × 105 P815.B7–1 cells pretreated with mitomycin C (50 ॖg/ml/107 cells for 90 min at 37 °C; Sigma) in 1.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in each well of a 24-well plate. On the fifth day, cells were harvested and subjected to Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation to remove cell debris. In some experiments, cells primed for a second 4–5-day period were used as indicated. 3 × 104 purified CD8+ T cells were stimulated with 3 × 104 mitomycin C-treated P815.B7–1 cells in a 96-well microtiter plate. At various times after plating, 1 ॖCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the cells. After a 6-hour pulse, the plates were frozen until harvested. The wells were harvested for determination of [3H]thymidine incorporation using a Packard Filtermate Harvester and TopCount-NXT (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). At each day of priming, cells grown in a 24-well plate were collected from three wells and stained with trypan blue. The average number of trypan blue-negative cells was calculated. For days 1 and 2, there was the possibility that remaining live P815.B7–1 cells (H-2d) would prevent accurate counting of T cells. Therefore, cells were dually stained with PE-anti-CD8 (BD Biosciences) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-Kd (BD Biosciences). After the exclusion of propidium iodide-positive cells, the percentage of CD8-positive and Kd-positive cells was determined. After day 1 of priming, no viable Kd-positive cells remained in the culture. To obtain the number of live T cells, the percentage of CD8 positive cells was then multiplied by the number of trypan-blue-negative cells. Two days after priming, >987 of live cells stained positive for CD8 (data not shown). To confirm the naı̈ve and primed states of the cells, they were stained for cell surface markers CD44 (PE-anti-CD44, BD Biosciences) and CD62L (PE-anti-CD62L, BD Biosciences). Potential nonspecific binding was blocked with anti-Fc receptor monoclonal antibody 2.4G2. Single-color analysis was carried out using FACScanTM and CellQuestTM software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Expression of CD44 and CD62L was verified prior to each experiment. For cell stimulation, 96-well flat-bottom plates (Costar) were coated with varying amounts of anti-CD3 (2C11) and 1 ॖg/ml anti-CD28 (PV-1) (a gift from Carl June, University of Pennsylvania) overnight at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and assessed by ELISA. To assess cytolytic activity, 2 × 10351Cr-labeled targets were plated with 2 × 105 naı̈ve or effector CD8+ T cells in a 96-well V-bottom plate (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA). After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, 50 ॖl of supernatant was transferred to a LumaPlate-96 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and allowed to dry overnight. Plates were then counted using TopCount-NXT (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Total RNA was isolated from purified T cells. Both naı̈ve and primed CD8+ T cells were first subjected to Ficoll-Hypaque to remove dead cells. Cells remaining in the interface were isolated and washed before being lysed in Trizol® (Invitrogen). Total RNA was then treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) to minimize contamination from genomic DNA. Further purification was carried out using the RNeasy® Clean-Up protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was quantitated using the DU-530 spectrophotometer (Beckman). Two replicate experiments were performed using independent batches of total RNA. Biotin-labeledin vitro transcripts for hybridization of Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays were prepared from 5 ॖg of total RNA according to Affymetrix protocols. Briefly, cDNA was made with the SuperScriptTM Choice System (Invitrogen) using 1 ॖl of 110 ॖm oligo(dT)/T7 primer (5′-GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG-(dT)24). The double-stranded cDNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, precipitated with 0.5 volumes of 7.5m ammonium acetate and 2.5 volumes of 1007 ethanol.In vitro transcription with biotin-labeled ribonucleotides was performed with the Enzo BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Enzo Diagnostics, New York, NY). Labeled in vitrotranscripts were purified over RNeasy® mini columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 12.5 ॖg of purified, labeled transcript was used to hybridize with each Affymetrix array according to the manufacturer's instructions. The average intensities for each probe set were obtained, and the average intensity of each chip was scaled to the arbitrary value of 300 to allow comparisons among the various chips. After the minimum intensity value was set to 50, the ratio of the average probe set intensities between experiments from effector and the corresponding naı̈ve cells was calculated. If a probe set was called absent in the chips from all the experiments, it was excluded from further calculations. The average of the two ratios was calculated, and genes that expressed greater than 3-fold were manually sorted into functional categories. Genes with absolute expression levels less than 100 in all experiments, as well as ESTs and unknown genes, were excluded from further analysis. Visualization of the intensity and ratio was performed using Spotfire® Array ExplorerTM(Spotfire, Somerville, MA) software. A list of differentially expressed genes represented on the microarray is provided in the Supplemental Information at http://www.jbc.org. Gene chip array results were confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. 20 ॖg of total RNA was used for first strand cDNA synthesis. Samples were normalized based on equivalent औ-actin expression by RT-PCR. For each PCR amplification, 1 ॖl of cDNA was used in a 50-ॖl reaction. To ensure that amplification remained within the linear range, 1:5 serial dilutions of cDNA were made. RT-PCR for औ-actin (25 cycles) was used as a control for mRNA abundance. For other genes, the number of cycles ranged from 25 to 45. Annealing temperatures varied, since theTm of each primer differed, and amplification was carried out at 72 °C. RT-PCR for each gene was performed several times using different batches of cDNA. For sequences of gene-specific primers, refer to the Supplemental Information at http://www.jbc.org. Cells were lysed in either Triton lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mmNaCl, 0.57 Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmtrypsin inhibitor, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), 10 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 25 ॖmp-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidinobenzoate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), or RIPA buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 17 Igepal CA-630, 0.57 sodium deoxycholate, 0.17 SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmtrypsin inhibitor, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 25 ॖmp-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidinobenzoate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cytosolic lysates from 3 to 5 × 106 naı̈ve and primed 2C/RAG2−/− CD8+ T cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10–157 acrylamide gels. Lysates from equal numbers of cells were loaded on the same blot. Total protein content in naı̈ve and primed cells was measured using DC Protein Assay Reagent (Bio-Rad). For immunoblotting, polyclonal antibodies were diluted 1:250, and monoclonal antibodies were diluted 1:500–1:1000 with 17 bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20. Antibodies against most molecules were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-Gelsolin antibody was a gift from David Kwiatkowski (Harvard University). Antibodies against the following proteins were obtained from the indicated sources: calpactin (annexin I) (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA); calcyclin (annexin II) (Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland); and Lck, Fyn, and PP1α (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Appropriate secondary antibodies were diluted 1:2500–3000 with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20: horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-α-goat IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.); HRP-α-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences); HRP-α-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). We used the 2C TCR transgenic model (24Sha W.C. Nelson C.A. Newberry R.D. Kranz D.M. Russell J.H. Loh D.Y. Nature. 1988; 335: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) to study the functional differences between naı̈ve and effector CD8+ T cells. These mice were crossed into the RAG2−/− background to ensure a monoclonal population of CD8+ cells (9Fields P.E. Finch R.J. Gray G.S. Zollner R. Thomas J.L. Sturmhoefel K. Lee K. Wolf S. Gajewski T.F. Fitch F.W. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5268-5275PubMed Google Scholar). Naı̈ve cells were freshly isolated from the spleens of 4- to 6-week-old mice by negative selection. A subset of purified 2C/RAG2−/− T cells was taken to generate effector CD8+ T cells in vitro through a 5-day stimulation with mitomycin C-treated P815.B7–1 cells. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, this stimulation resulted in vigorous thymidine incorporation that peaked on day 3, with an expansion of viable T cell numbers that lagged behind by 24 h. By day 5, the cells re-entered a resting state, at which time they did not proliferate or spontaneously produce cytokines. At later times, without restimulation, the T cells began to die, presumably due to the lack of viable antigen-presenting cells (data not shown). The primed cells used in this study were taken on the fifth day after stimulation. Phenotypically, naı̈ve 2C T cells were CD44lo and CD62Lhi, whereas the majority of effector cells were CD44hi and CD62Llo (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, effector cells contained an average 4-fold increase in total RNA content (naı̈ve: 5.1 ± 3.4 ॖg/107cells; effector: 19.6 ± 2.7 ॖg/107 cells). Primed effector 2C T cells generated in this manner routinely produced the cytokines IL-2 (Fig. 2A) and IFN-γ (Fig. 2B) and acquired antigen-specific cytolytic activity (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the increased IL-2-producing capability of primed cells was reflected by a shift in the dose response to anti-CD3 mAb, whereas the increased IFN-γ production was reflected predominantly by an increased magnitude of response. These results suggest that at least two molecular mechanisms may account for the greater cytokine-producing capability of primed effector CD8+ T cells. RNA from naı̈ve and effector CD8+ T cells was used to hybridize to Affymetrix Mu11k chips containing ∼11,000 known mouse genes and ESTs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.3 shows a dot plot of the expression pattern of individual genes in naı̈ve versus effector CD8+ T cells from the first of two independent experiments. Most genes were not significantly expressed in these T cells and thus clustered near the origin of the plot. Most genes that were expressed in 2C T cells were expressed comparably in both the naive and effector populations and thus fell along a line with a slope of one. However, a number of genes was expressed at greater levels in either the effector population (above thediagonal) or in the naive population (below thediagonal). The expression data from two replicate experiments were averaged, and known full-length genes whose levels in each T cell population differed by 3-fold or greater were defined to be differentially expressed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Approximately 177 known genes met these criteria (Fig. 4 and the Supplemental Information at http://www.jbc.org). RNA expression of 68 known genes increased with priming, while that of 109 known genes decreased. Although the ratios of RNA expression level for some genes differed between the two experiments, the expression patterns of the vast majority of genes were concordant. As expected, expression of genes related to T cell effector function and surface receptors associated with activation increased upon priming. Primed effector CD8+ T cells expressed markedly increased levels of CTLA-2α, Granzyme A,SPI-3, and CCPI genes, all of which encode proteins involved in cytolysis (Fig. 4A). Increased basal expression of cytokine genes was not detected, supporting the notion that the effector T cell population was resting at the time of collection. Genes encoding cell surface receptors known to correlate with naive and effector states changed as expected. The RNA level of CD62L was decreased in effector CD8+ T cells compared with naive cells, whereas the levels of Ly6.2and CTLA-4 were increased (Fig. 4B). Of note, mRNA levels of genes involved in generating metabolic potential increased (Fig. 4C). Expression of genes encoding α-enolase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, hexokinase II, 6-phosphofructokinase type C (all participants in the glycolytic pathway) was induced in effector CD8+ T cells. Some housekeeping genes such as Apex, which is involved in base excision repair and also regulates DNA binding activity of transcription factors, and DDOST, which is involved in the transfer of an oligosaccharide onto nascent polypeptides from the endoplasmic reticulum, were down-regulated. Expression of several molecules associated with cytoskeletal regulation was also increased in primed cells. Although the levels of actin transcripts did not change appreciably upon priming, mRNAs for gelsolin,calcyclin, and calpactin were markedly up-regulated (Fig. 4D). Unexpectedly, more genes encoding signal transduction proteins and transcription factors were down-regulated than were up-regulated upon T cell priming. Among the few up-regulated mRNAs were those encoding the heterotrimeric Gγ subunit, ERK-1, and molecules involved in inositol phospholipid signaling, such as myoinositol-1 (or -4) monophosphatase (IMP) and an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (p400) (Fig. 4E). However, many genes were found to be expressed at lower levels in primed cells, including those encoding phosphatases (MKP-1,PRL-1, and PP2A) and putative adapters (SOCS-3 and 14–3–3). Primed effector cells also displayed lower levels of the transcription factor genes Jun B, c-Fos, FOG, Ikaros,c-Jun, Ets-1, and Ets-2. (Fig.4F). Interestingly, basal expression of the Fos family member Fos B was much increased in effector cells over naı̈ve cells, as was that of GATA-3, a transcription factor required for T helper 2 development. Expression of genes related to cell cycle regulation was varied, presumably because of a fraction of T cells completing cell cycle progression post-activation. Interestingly, transcripts forHMG-14, a non-histone chromosomal protein that binds nucleosomes, and GST1-Hs, a G1 to S phase transition protein, were in higher abundance in naı̈ve cells (Fig. 4G). In addition, putative negative regulators of the cell cycle or antiproliferative molecules, such as TSC22,GADD45, MyD116, G0S8, BTG1, and TOB1, were overexpressed in naive cells and decreased following differentiation. These genes are attractive candidates for contributing to the quiescent phenotype of naive T cells. Interestingly, genes involved in protein folding (BIP,HSP90, HSP105, calnexin) were more highly expressed in naı̈ve cells (Fig. 4H), as were genes involved in translation (EIF-1α, EIF-4α). Additional miscellaneous genes are listed in Fig. 4I. A subset of 40 genes of interest was selected to re-examine mRNA expression levels by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Complementary DNA from independent batches of naı̈ve and effector 2C CD8+ T cells were used in these analyses. Naı̈ve and effector cDNA were normalized based on औ-actin expression as determined by RT-PCR because औ-actin mRNA and protein expression were similar between naı̈ve and effector cells. Of these 40 genes, 35 gave similar results to those seen by gene array, yielding a concordance rate of 887 (Table I). Thus, results obtained using oligonucleotide arrays are not necessarily identical to those obtained by gene-specific RT-PCR, emphasizing the importance of confirmatory screens.Table IGene array confirmation by RT-PCRCategoryGeneAccessionRT-PCR1-aA subset of genes that were differentially expressed based on two gene array screens was selected for verification by semiquantitative RT-PCR.

Five human FN cDNA segments encoding for FN fragments, all starting with the II1 repeat and ending with different C-terminal extensions, have been stably expressed in chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF). These FN cDNAs induce the formation of an organized ECM in CEF as long as they retain a sequence coding for a 13-amino acid stretch (FN13), with collagen binding activity, localized between type II2 and I7 repeats. An FN13 synthetic peptide induces in control CEF the assembly of an FN-ECM comparable with that observed in CEF-expressing FN fragments. The activity of FN13 is specific for its amino acid sequence, although the cysteine present in the 6th position can be substituted with a polar serine without affecting the induction of a fibrillar FN-ECM. A less fibrillar matrix is induced by FN13-modified peptides in which the cysteine is methylated or substituted by a non-polar alanine. FN13 induces the assembly of an FN-ECM also in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed CEF lacking the ECM and in hepatoma (SK-Hep1) and fibrosarcoma (HT-1080) human cell lines. FN13 also promotes the adhesion of CEF and Rous sarcoma virus-CEF at levels comparable with those obtained with purified intact FN. Finally, FN13 inhibits the migratory and invasive properties of tumorigenic cells, whereas intact FN favors their migration. All FN13-modified peptides show similar effects, although with reduced efficiency. None of these activities is supported by a scrambled peptide. These data suggest a possible role of FN13 in tumor growth and metastasis inhibition and its possible use as anti-tumorigenic agent.

FN contains three types of homologous repeats (I–III), organized in functional domains, connected by flexible, protease-sensitive segments, which allow the binding of the molecule to ECM components (fibrin, heparin, collagen, FN, and integrin receptors) (1Yamada K.M.

Through these multiple interactions, FN provides a scaffold for ECM assembly and takes part in different physiological and pathological processes (4Ruoslahti E.

Struct. 1979; 11: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because addition of FN to tumor-derived cultured cells improves cell adhesion and induces ECM and cytoskeleton organization, supporting the normal cell morphology, FN has been associated with the normal cell phenotypes (6Vaheri A. Keski-Oja J. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1989: 255-271Google Scholar, 10Yamada K.M. Yamada S. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The inability of the transformed cells to deposit the ECM has been related to the proteolytic fragmentation of FN generated by the enhanced levels of proteases released by tumors and transformed cells (12Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Liotta L.A. Kleiner Jr., D.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1434-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 13Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Physiol.

Pasteur. 1994; 92: 269-275Google Scholar), as well as to the down-regulation of the expression of integrin receptors binding to FN and supporting ECM assembly (7Ruoslahti E. Adv. Cancer Res. 1999; 76: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Along these lines are also observations that an excessive ECM, containing collagens and FN,i.e. desmoplasia, is often deposited in stroma surrounding invasive carcinomas (15Barlati S. Colombi M. De Petro G. Ádány R. Tumor Matrix Biology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 81-100Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this stromal response temporarily antagonizes tumor growth and invasion (14Barlati S. Bull. Inst. Pasteur. 1994; 92: 269-275Google Scholar, 16Takeuchi J. Toida M. Ádány R. Tumor Matrix Biology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-22Google Scholar). Thus, the absence of an ECM of FN is associated with the transformed phenotype, whereas the presence of the ECM restricts cell invasion and migration in many tumor cells. The transition from assembly to non-assembly of the ECM may therefore be an important stage in cancer progression. The assembly of FN into fibrils in vitro and in vivo requires multiple binding sites within FN including an N-terminal region consisting of the first five type I repeats (17McKeown-Longo P.J.

Zhang Z. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). sFN resembles the matrix fibrils produced by cultured fibroblasts, is highly adhesive, can inhibit cell spreading and migration in vitro, prevents tumor formation in nude mice injected with human tumorigenic cells, and has a strong antimetastatic activity (30Pasqualini R. Bourdoulous S. Koivunen E. Woods Jr., V.L. Ruoslahti E. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, the 76-amino acid peptide assembling FN in vitrohas been reported to suppress tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in mice even in the absence of FN (31Yi M. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The study of proteolytic FNfgs has disclosed cryptic biological activities not shared by the native protein (32De Petro G. Barlati S. Vartio T. Vaheri A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this work we expressed five human recombinant FNfgs, spanning from the II1 to the III2 repeat of the molecule and encompassing the COL-domain in CEF, and we studied their ability to induce the FN-ECM organization. All FNfgs but one, which lacked the sequence coding for a 13-amino acid stretch with collagen binding activity, induced the organization of the FN-ECM either in control or in RSV-CEF. Therefore, we restricted the ECM organization capability of FNfgs to this 13-amino acid sequence. We demonstrate that the synthetic peptide corresponding to this sequence (FN13) induces the assembly of FN in cultured cells, enhances cell adhesion, and inhibits Matrigel matrix invasion of RSV-CEF and human tumor cell lines. In this work we used an anti-human FN rabbit polyclonal antibody (Ab) (Sigma) and three anti-FN mAbs: the f33 anti-human FN (hFN), recognizing an epitope located in the C terminus of the 120–140-kDa catheptic FNfg located downstream of the COL-domain (45Salonen E.-M. Vartio T. Miggiano V. Stähli C. Takacs B. Virgallilta G. De Petro G. Barlati S. Vaheri A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); the f25 mAb, recognizing an epitope located at the N terminus of the same fragment, either in human or, improved with efficiency, in chick FN 2S. Barlati and A. Vaheri, unpublished results.; and the f29 anti-hFN mAb, recognizing an epitope in the 14-kDa hFN catheptic fragment flanking the COL-domain (46Vartio T. Barlati S. De Petro G. Miggiano V. Stahli C. Takacs B. Vaheri A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Anti-chick FN and anti-chick COLI Abs were kindly provided by A. Colombatti (Aviano, Italy). Five 13-amino acid synthetic peptides (Primm, Milan) were used: FN13 (AHEEICTTNEGVM), containing 13 amino acids of hFN COL-site and differing from this binding site as regards the absence of an N-terminal A (47Owens R.J. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2825-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); FN13Ser and FN13Ala, differing from FN13 regarding substitution of the cysteine in the 6th position from the N terminus with a serine, or an alanine, respectively; FN13Mod, identical to the FN13 peptide sequence with a methylated cysteine and FN13 scrambled sequence peptide (ScrFN13) (ITCETNEGEVAMH). Mass spectrometry was performed by the manufacturer for all peptides, with a 95% purity assessed by high pressure liquid chromatography. The cloning system consisted of two vectors: the miniplasmid Cla12NCO and the retroviral vector RCASBP (48Givol I. Givol D. Rulong S. Resau J. Tsarfaty I. Hughes S.H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2609-2618PubMed Google Scholar). Cla12NCO is an adaptor plasmid for RCASBP in which it is possible to clone DNA in a polylinker flanked by ClaI restriction sites. After ClaI restriction, the cloned DNA can be inserted in the unique RCASBP ClaI site. RCASBP contains the 5′- and 3′-long terminal repeats and the complete coding sequence for Gag, Pol, and Env proteins. The expression of the DNA inserted in this site is under the control of the long terminal repeat promoters and is translated from the start site present in the ClaI polylinker; after transfection and integration in CEF, RCASBP genes are expressed at high levels and direct the production of non-transforming retroviruses that infect all cells in culture. The cDNA coding for the human FN type II1-III2 repeats (II1-III2 fragment, 1.47 kb) (Fig. 1) was obtained by pFH134 plasmid HindIII and PvuII restriction (49Kornblihtt A.R. Umezawa K. Vibe-Pedersen K. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and dimerized with T4 ligase. A palindromic self-annealing SacI linker (5′GTGTGGAGCTCCACAC3′) was ligated to the PvuII blunt ends; the modified II1-III2 cDNA was digested withHindIII and SacI and inserted in theSacI- and HindIII-linearized/Cla12NCO plasmid. A 95-bp cDNA fragment coding for the hFN secretion signal peptide was obtained by PCR on pgHF3.7 plasmid (50Dean D.C. Bowlus C.L. Bourgeois S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1876-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with the primers 5′dACATGCTTAGGGGTCCGG3′ and 5′rCCTCTTGCTCTTCGAGGC3′ and VentTaq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and inserted in-frame upstream of the II1-III2cDNA in the filled-in Cla12NCO polylinker EcoRI site. From this recombinant plasmid, 4 FN cDNA fragments, maintaining a common 5′ end and lacking progressive portions at the 3′ end, were generated by restriction digestion (Fig. 1) as follows: the II1-I9 (0.9 kb), lacking type III1and III2 cDNA; the II1-I8 (0.7 kb), lacking the I9 cDNA; the II1-II2 (0.5 kb), lacking I8, and a portion of I7 (114 bp from the 3′ end) cDNA. The II1-II2 cDNA contains 30 bp of I7 5′ end and maintains the COL-site sequence (AAHEEICTTNEGVM) spanning from the type II2 to the adjacent type I repeat (47Owens R.J. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2825-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The last cDNA fragment, the II1-II2del (461 bp), derives from the II1-II2 construct without the 39 bp at the 3′ end encoding for the COL-site without the first alanine (47Owens R.J. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2825-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recombinant Cla12NCO plasmids were transformed in KH802Escherichia coli strain (51Mandel M. Higa A. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 53: 54-162Crossref Scopus (1532) Google Scholar); after amplification, they were purified by Endo Free Plasmid Maxi and QIAprep Spin Miniprep kits from Qiagen (Diagen, GmbH, Germany); the FN cDNA inserts were excised byClaI digestion and ligated in the ClaI-linearized RCASBP. After transformation in E. coli, the recombinant retroviral vectors, carrying the FN cDNA inserts in the correct orientation, were selected by restriction mapping and PCR analysis. Five recombinant RCASBPs containing the different FN cDNAs were generated (RCASBPFN constructs) with FN cDNAs inserted in-frame, as ascertained by sequence analysis. Primary cultures of CEF were prepared as described previously (52Kryceve-Martinerie C. Biquard J.M. Lawrence D. Vigier P. Barlati S. Mignatti P. Virology. 1981; 112: 436-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Secondary CEF were grown in Hanks' MEM with 5% (v/v) newborn calf serum (Invitrogen), 10% (v/v) tryptose phosphate broth, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml ampicillin. Normal human adult skin fibroblasts were prepared in our laboratory from control donor skin biopsy. Human fibrosarcoma (HT-1080), hepatoma (SK-Hep1), cervix epithelioid carcinoma (HeLa), and rhabdomyosarcoma tumor-derived cell lines were from the ATCC. Human cells were grown in Earle's MEM, 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. For SK-Hep1 cells the medium was supplemented with 1% (v/v) sodium pyruvate and non-essential amino acids. Secondary cultures of CEF were transfected using the calcium phosphate method (53Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 5: 456-467Crossref Scopus (6503) Google Scholar) with empty RCASBP expression vector or with RCASBPFN constructs using the CellPhect transfection kit (Amersham Biosciences). In particular, 15 μg of retroviral vectors were co-precipitated with calcium phosphate for 30 min and added to monolayers of CEF. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the media were removed. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and complete medium was added. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Secondary CEF were seeded on round coverslips (1.5 cm inner diameter in a 24-well plate (Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA)) (40,000 cells/well) in Hanks' MEM supplemented as above and infected with 30focus-forming units of PA1 SR-RSV, subgroup D mutant (52Kryceve-Martinerie C. Biquard J.M. Lawrence D. Vigier P. Barlati S. Mignatti P. Virology. 1981; 112: 436-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). After 24 h of incubation at 35 °C, the medium was changed, and after 24 h, the cultures were treated with purified FN and FN13. The expression of human FN cDNAs, transfected in CEF in the RCASBP vector, was analyzed by RT-PCR on total RNAs and purified from control and transfected CEF at the 4th in vitro passage after transfection, with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). One μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed by standard procedures; PCR was carried out using the primers 5′dGCGGTAGCTGGACGTGC3′, corresponding to 17 nucleotides of Cla12NCO linker, and 5′rCCTCTTGCTCTTCGAGGC3′, corresponding to 18 nucleotides of FN secretion signal sequence, present in all constructs, using a standard protocol. The product of the reaction was a 133-bp DNA fragment in all transfectants integrating and expressing the RCASBP constructs. The endogenous FN mRNA expressed by control and by transfected CEF was evaluated by RT-PCR performed with a set of primers amplifying a 419-bp segment of chick FN cDNA encoding for a fragment that spans from the III8 to the III10repeat absent in hFNfgs (54De Petro G. Tavian D. Copeta A. Portolani N. Giulini S.M. Barlati S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2234-2239PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of human FN cDNAs in CEF transfected with the different RCASBP constructs was analyzed at different in vitro passages byin situ hybridization with a 461-bp FN cDNA probe (i.e. the II1-II2del fragment) labeled by nick translation (Invitrogen) in the presence of unlabeled dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP (6 μm each) and of an excess of [α-33P]dATP (2000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), according to the supplier's instructions. In situhybridization was performed as reported previously (55Colombi M. Moro L. Zoppi N. Barlati S. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) on CEF cultured on microscope slides, and the hybridization grains were quantitatively evaluated with the Magiscan Image Analysis System (Joyce Loebl, Gateshead, UK). 8 × 104 CEF not transfected and transfected with the different RCASBPFN constructs were seeded on 22 × 22-mm glass coverslips and grown in Hanks' MEM, 10% tryptose phosphate broth, and 5% newborn calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After 48 h, the cells were washed in PBS, methanol-fixed twice for 20 min at 4 °C, air-dried, and immunoreacted with anti-chick FN and anti-chick-COLI Ab and with the f25 mAb. Anti-FN and anti-COLI Ab, 1:100 in 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% NaN3 (diluting buffer), and f25 mAb, 1:10 in diluting buffer, were reacted for 30 min at room temperature. After washing 3 times for 3 min in PBS, the cells were reacted with rhodamine- or fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:100 in diluting buffer) for 30 min at room temperature, washed 3 times for 5 min in PBS, mounted on glass slides in 1:1 PBS/glycerol solution, and photographed with a Leitz fluorescence microscope. The assembly of the FN-ECM was also analyzed by IF in non-transfected CEF cultured in the presence of purified hFN (New York Blood Center Inc.) or of FN13, FN13Mod, FN13Ser, FN13Ala, and ScrFN13 synthetic peptides. Increasing concentrations of peptides were added to the medium (from 5 to 80 μg/ml) for 48 h, and the cells were immunoreacted either with anti-hFN f25 mAb or with the anti-chick COLI Ab. The FN-ECM IF analysis was also performed on secondary CEF, before and after RSV infection, and on human skin fibroblasts, hepatoma (SK-Hep1), and fibrosarcoma (HT-1080) tumor-derived cell lines, grown in the absence and in the presence of conditioned media recovered from transfected CEF expressing the different FNfgs, or of 5–10 μg/ml hFN, or of 40 μg/ml FN13. After 48 h treatment, the cells were immunoreacted with f25 (CEF) and f33 (human cells) FN mAbs as reported above. Quantitative evaluation of the fluorescence (associated with the ECM organized by control, transfected, and peptide-treated CEF and by SK-Hep1 and HT-1080 tumor cells) was performed as follows. The fluorescent images, with the same spatial resolution and comparable light intensity, were captured by a CCD black and white TV camera mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 10S/H fluorescence microscope. By using the Image-Pro Plus program (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD), a task list file was developed that could be executed in semi-automatic mode on different images. Each image was processed by applying Sharpen and Rank nonlinear filters to optimize the image contrast and to remove the background noise. A binary image, visualized as a red overlay, corresponding to the fluorescence signal, was obtained by setting two thresholds in the fluorescence peak corresponding to the gray tones of the image visualized, with the lighter tones at the highest value of the peak and the darker ones below the slice background. The sequence of options in the task list was repeated on four images captured on each slide; the area without cells was subtracted from the field area containing the fluorescence signal, and the integrated optical density (IOD), related to the field area containing the signal, was measured and normalized to the cell number present in each image. The effect of FN13 on CEF and CEF-RSV adhesion was tested by seeding 4 × 104 cells in 24-well plates (Corning Costar, Italy) coated with 0.5–10 μg/ml FN13 or with 10 μg/ml hFN. The adhesion assay was also performed on human control skin fibroblasts, HT-1080 and SK-Hep1 tumor cell lines in the presence of 10 μg/ml hFN or FN13. Coating of hFN and FN13 diluted in PBS was performed for 2 h at 37 °C followed by blocking with 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. After medium removal, the cells were allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cell adhesion was quantified by staining the cells with crystal violet in 20% methanol, rinsing with water, and counting the cells with an optic microscope. The reported values are means ± S.D. of three independent measurements. The effect of FN13, FN13Mod, FN13Ser, FN13Ala, and ScrFN13 peptides on cell migration was studied using the Transwell 8-μm filter (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) migration assay. 5 × 104 control and RSV-CEF, human control skin fibroblasts, HT-1080 and SK-Hep1 cells, resuspended in serum-free culture medium, were plated onto the upper chamber and allowed to migrate for 6 h through the polycarbonate filter into the lower chamber. The bottom wells were filled with culture medium supplemented with or without 10 μg/ml hFN and the different FN13 peptides. Migrating cells collected in the bottom chamber were counted, and their number is reported as the average of three independent experiments. Transwell 8-μm filters were coated with 150 μg/filter Matrigel basement membrane matrix (BD Biosciences) diluted in cold PBS. 2 × 105 human control fibroblasts, HT-1080, and SK-Hep1 tumor cells, suspended indulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-decomplemented FBS supplemented or not with 40 μg/ml FN13, FN13Mod, FN13Ser, FN13Ala, ScrFN13 peptides or purified hFN, were added to the upper Transwell chamber. Conditioned medium from human control fibroblasts, grown in the absence of FBS, was placed in the lower chamber. The assays were carried out at 37 °C in 5% CO2atmosphere for 48 h; the non-invasive cells were removed with a cotton swab, and the filters were fixed in methanol and stained with 5% (v/v) Giemsa. All cells adhering to the filters were counted. Each assay was performed in triplicate. Five cDNAs encoding for human FNfgs with a common N terminus and different C termini (Fig.1) were inserted in the retroviral vector RCASBP and transfected in secondary CEF. The transfected cells integrated and expressed the recombinant FN cDNAs, as shown by RT-PCR performed on RNAs purified at the 4th in vitro cell passage (Fig. 2A). The level of endogenous FN mRNA was similar in control and transfected CEF, as shown by RT-PCR performed with a set of primers amplifying an FN mRNA region between type III8 and III10repeats absent in the hFN cDNAs (not shown) (54De Petro G. Tavian D. Copeta A. Portolani N. Giulini S.M. Barlati S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2234-2239PubMed Google Scholar). By us"

The interaction between tubulin and Gα, which also involves the direct transfer of GTP from tubulin to Gα (transactivation), is not yet fully understood. This study, using chimeras of Giα and Gtα, showed that the Giα (215–295) segment converted Gtα to bind to tubulin and this chimera (chimera 1) could be transactivated by tubulin. Insertion of Gtα (237–270) into chimera 1 to form chimera 2 resulted in a protein that, like Gtα, did not bind tubulin. Thus, it was thought that the Giα (237–270) domain was essential to modulate the binding of Giα1 to tubulin. Surprisingly, when domain (237–270) of Giα was replaced by Gtα (237–270) to form chimera 3, the chimera bound to tubulin with a similar affinity (KD ≅120 nm) as wild-type Giα1. However, even though chimera 3 displayed normal GTP binding, it was not transactivated by GTP-tubulin. Furthermore, when these chimeras were expressed in COS-1 cells, cellular processes in cells overexpressing Giα1 or chimera 1 were more abundant and longer than those in native cells. Gα was seen throughout the length of the process. Morphology of cells expressing chimera 2 was identical to controls. Consistent with the role of Chimera 3 as a “dominant negative” Gα, cells transfected with chimera 3 had only few truncated processes. This study demonstrates that although Giα (237–270) is not obligatory for the binding of Giα to tubulin, it is crucial for the transactivation of Gα by tubulin. These results also suggest that the transactivation of Gα by tubulin may play an important role in modulating microtubule organization and cell morphology.

Due to their interaction with transmembrane receptors and lipid modification, G proteins are usually associated with the plasma membrane. Recently, increasing evidence has emerged that G proteins are also present at intracellular areas such as Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, cytoskeleton, and even the nucleus (1Crouch M.F.

Rasenick M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R.

Thus, it is possible that G proteins exist in several different cellular locations and play roles in various physiologic processes. Microtubules, a major component of the cytoskeleton, are involved in many cellular functions including chromosome movements during mitosis, intracellular transport, and the modulations of cell morphology. The biological function of microtubules is based, in significant part, on the ability of tubulin to polymerize and depolymerize. A heterodimer of α- and β-tubulin is the basic building block of microtubules. Tubulin is a GTP-binding protein, two GTP molecules are bound noncovalently in exchangeable (E-site on β-tubulin) and nonexchangeable (N-site on α-tubulin) sites. Both Gα subunits and tubulin have intrinsic GTPase activity but that of tubulin is activated during the process of polymerization (10Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4814-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or when complexed with Gα (11Roychowdhury S. Panda D. Wilson L. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol.

This binding appears to activate the G protein due to a direct transfer of GTP from the E-site in tubulin to Gα (transactivation) (16Yan K. Popova J.S. Moss A. Shah B. Rasenick M.M. J.

In addition, the association of Gα and tubulin induces GTPase activity in tubulin and modulates microtubule polymerization dynamics in vitro(11Roychowdhury S. Panda D. Wilson L. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13485-13490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Roychowdhury S. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9800-9805Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Agonists for certain G protein-coupled receptors induce microtubule depolymerization and tubulin relocation to the plasma membrane (20Popova J.S. Rasenick M.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2774-2782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that microtubules might be involved in regulation of signal transduction, whereas G protein signaling may modulate microtubule polymerization. In the present study, functional domains in the Giα1 amino acid sequence that mediate the interaction of Giα with tubulin were investigated. We report here that the 237–270 region of Giα appears not only to contribute to the binding of Giα to tubulin but also is crucial for the transactivation of Gα by tubulin. The transactivation of Gα by tubulin may be an important factor for the modulation of tubulin polymerization dynamics and cell shape by hormone and neurotransmitters. Gtα/Giα1 chimera A, (Giα1 1–237/Gtα 237–270/Giα1 270–295/Gtα 295–314/Giα1 314–354), and Gtα/Giα1 chimera B, (Gtα 1–236/Giα1 236–350) were first constructed. These were used to construct chimera 3 by replacing the chimera A C-terminal sequence (270–350) with the chimera B Giα1 (270–350) domain. To assemble DNA fragments encoding chimera 3, both plasmids were digested withHindIII and AsuII. A shortAsuII-HindIII DNA fragment from the expression vector encoding chimera B was ligated with a large DNA fragment derived from the expression vector encoding chimera A. This new chimeric Gtα/Giα1 construct, chimera 3, was confirmed by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. Chimera 1 and chimera 2 had been previously described (21Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, all chimeras and His6 tag Giα1 were subcloned into PcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) for expression in the mammalian cells. The Escherichia coliBL21 cells transformed with the vectors harboring chimera 3 and Giα1 were grown in 2× YT medium with 100 μg/ml of ampicillin at room temperature up toA600 of 0.5 and then induced with 30 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature for 16–20 h. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1:20 of a cell culture volume of buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 μm GDP, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (buffer A) and disrupted by ultra-sonication using eight 30 s pulses with 1 min breaks in between pulses. The crude cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. The supernatant was collected and adjusted to 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole (binding buffer). The cell lysate was loaded onto 5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column preliminary equilibrated with the binding buffer. After washing the column with 10 bed volumes of binding buffer, the bound material was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, and 100 mm imidazole and subjected to overnight dialysis against buffer A with 20% glycerol. The protein samples were directly applied to 1 ml Mono Q column equilibrated with buffer A without GDP and β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were eluted with 0–1 m NaCl gradients in buffer A. An increase in tryptophan fluorescence was measured with excitation at 280 nm and emission at 340 nm to monitor AlF4−-dependent conformational change of chimeric Gα subunits, to determine the activity of the purified protein as described by Skiba et al. (21Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The eluted proteins were supplemented with GDP, β-mercaptoethanol, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a concentration of 25 μm, 2 mm, and 0.1 mm, respectively, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C for several months with no loss of functional activity (21Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Binding of AlF4− to Gα-GDP mimics the GTP conformation of the molecule and changes in Trp fluorescence can be used to monitor the “viability” of a Gα construct. To measure this, 200 nm Giα1 or the chimeras were incubated at room temperature in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl. Fluorescence was measured in an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 Spectrometer (SLM-Aminco) using excitation of 280 nm and emission at 340 nm. Measurements were taken before and 5 min after the addition of 10 mm NaF and 30 μm AlCl3. Fluorescence increases were expressed as a percent change from the initial fluorescence: (ΔF (%) = (F−Fo)/Fo × 100, where Fo is the initial fluorescence andF is the fluorescence after fluoride addition. This method is described in Ref. 21Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar. Ovine brain tubulin was made by two assembly-disassembly cycles (22Shelanski M.L. Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar), in the presence of microtubule-associated proteins, which were subsequently removed by phosphocellulose chromatography. An aliquot of 100 μg of PC-tubulin in 100 μl of PIPES buffer was applied to a 12 × 75 mm glass tube precoated with 100 μg IODO-GEN (Pierce), which was dissolved in 100 μl of triethanolamine and dried in a ventilated hood. 2 μCi of Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) was then added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed with gentle agitation for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl of PIPES buffer containing 4 mm dithiothreitol. The free iodide was removed by ultrafiltration by loading the tubulin suspension on a 3-ml P-6DG (Bio-Rad) desalting column twice. The desalted 125I-tubulin was centrifuged at 11,500 rpm for 10 min to remove denatured protein, and the supernatant containing iodinated tubulin was used in protein binding experiments (14Wang N. Yan K. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1239-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified Giα1, chimera 3, bovine transducin, and ovalbumin (Sigma) were applied to nitrocellulose membrane (Midwest Scientific) in the amounts of 150, 100, 50, 25 ng, respectively. Nitrocellulose was incubated with 10% bovine serum albumin in 100 mm PIPES buffer at room temperature for 2 h to block nonspecific binding and then was incubated with 100 nmiodinated tubulin in 100 mm PIPES buffer at room temperature for 2 h. Nitrocellulose was then washed three times with PIPES buffer. Binding of tubulin to G protein α subunits was detected by radioautography. The affinity of tubulin for chimera 3 was estimated by immobilizing chimera 3 upon nitrocellulose and hybridizing with varying concentrations of 125I-tubulin. This was quantified in a gamma counter (Beckman Gamma 9000). The binding was dose-dependent and saturable (14Wang N. Yan K. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1239-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immobilized chimeras (other than chimera 2) bound 0.3–0.5 mol of tubulin/1 mol of Gα. Tubulin was incubated with [32P]p3–1, 4-azidoanilido-p1–5′-GTP (AAGTP) on ice for 30 mins in buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Free AAGTP was removed with two passes through a P6-DG column. The labeled tubulin was incubated with equimolar concentrations of Giα1, chimera 3, and Gtα at 30 °C for 30 min. UV irradiation, SDS gel electrophoresis, and analysis of results were performed as described in Ref. 16Yan K. Popova J.S. Moss A. Shah B. Rasenick M.M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. AAGTP transferred from tubulin to G protein was quantified in a phosphorimaging device (Storm 840; Molecular Dynamics). Plasmids were purified using the Qiagen Maxi purification kit. COS-1 cells were split and plated in a 1:15 dilution to 10 cm plates the day before transfection. Cells were transfected either with calcium phosphate or Lipofectin (Invitrogen). For calcium phosphate transfection, 20 μg DNA was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.2 m CaCl2 then added drop by drop to the 0.5 ml bubbling 2 × HBS (280 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, 12 mm dextrose, 50 mm HEPES). The precipitates were kept at room temperature for 30 min and were then applied to the plates. After 6 h of transfection, the cells were washed with PBS twice and changed to complete medium. Transfections with Lipofectin were done according to the manufacturer's instruction. COS-1 cells were grown on cover slips in 24-well plates containing Dulbecoo's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 mg penicillin and streptomycin. Before staining, the medium was removed, the cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with freezing cold 100% methanol in −20 °C for 10 min, and washed again with PBS twice. The cells were then incubated with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h and incubated in 1:100 dilution of primary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS four times and incubated with 1:100 dilution secondary antibodies labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate or TRITC (rhodamine) (EY Labs) in blocking buffer for 45 min. Finally, the cells were washed with PBS four times and mounted on the slide with polyvinyl alcohol mounting medium. The slides were air dried and examined with a fluorescence microscope with a 100 watt mercury arc lamp (Nikon, TE300). Images were collected with an interline charge-coupled device camera (Model 1300, Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) driven by IP lab software (Scanalytics Inc., Suitland, VA), and assembled in Adobe Photoshop. The quantification of images was done by assembling fluorescence images from cells transfected with the indicated constructs as well as non-transfected cells (examined by differential-interference contrast microscopy). Images were counted by two individuals blind to experimental condition, and the number and extent of processes for His6 positive cells (and control cells) was determined. To map tubulin-binding sites on Giα1 we constructed Giα1/Gtα chimeras where we exchanged several corresponding regions of these two structurally related proteins. The structures of chimeras are schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. The recombinant α subunits were expressed in E. coli and purified using a combination of affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose and Mono Q high pressure liquid chromatography. Both the GTP binding capability and the AlF4−induced conformational change as measured by tryptophan florescence at 340 nm were comparable for Giα1 and each of the 3 chimeric proteins. For Giα1, Gtα, chimera 1, and chimera 2, the AlF4− ΔF (% increase) was 55, 70, 50–55, and 60–70, respectively. For chimera 3, the AlF4− ΔF(% increase) was 50. The values given represent the increase in fluorescence upon Gα and Gα chimera activation. Ranges are given for multiple preparations (between two and six, depending upon the protein). Where a single value is given, two preparations gave the same results. Detected changes in intrinsic Trp fluorescence indicated that Giα1 and chimeras were fully functionally active. Those values, which are dependent upon the number of tryptophan residues, are similar to the values reported previously for Giα1, Gtα and Giα1/Gtα chimeras (21Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Previous results had suggested that Giα1 binds tubulin with a KD of 120 nm, whereas the affinity of Gtα for tubulin was too low to be measured reliably (14Wang N. Yan K. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1239-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A site on Gtα thought to interact with effectors was mapped to the residues 237–270 (21Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, two reciprocal chimeras containing the region 237–270 from Giα1 or Gtα (chimeras 1 and 2, respectively) were constructed. Fig. 2shows that chimera 1 was virtually indistinguishable from Giα1 in its ability to bind125I-tubulin, whereas chimera 2, similar to transducin, did not bind tubulin in any measurable manner. The third chimera, chimera 3, was constructed to measure the contributions of regions 237–270 directly. The replacement of this region of Giα1 with the analogous region of transducin resulted in a protein that bound tubulin to roughly the same extent as Giα1 (Fig. 2A). Scatchard analysis of tubulin binding to Giα1 and chimera 3 reveals saturable binding and a KD of 120 and 123 nm, respectively. The above data show that both chimera 1 and chimera 3 bind to tubulin with about the same affinity as Giα1. Chimera 1 can be transactivated via transfer of GTP from tubulin to a similar extent as Giα1. Approximately 50% of the AAGTP is distributed to each protein during this process, and GTP in the milieu has no access to either Gα or tubulin once a complex has formed (19Roychowdhury S. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9800-9805Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 demonstrates that chimera 3 failed to serve as a substrate for transactivation despite the fact that it bound to tubulin. When tubulin and Giα1 were incubated along with chimera 3, transactivation of Giα1 by tubulin was substantially diminished. Equimolar chimera 3 inhibits transactivation of Giα by 49.9 ± 13%. When the concentration of chimera 3 was increased to twice that of Giα1, transfer of AAGTP to Gα was blocked, and the AAGTP bound to tubulin was also decreased. These data suggest that chimera 3 cannot be transactivated by tubulin, and it inhibits the transfer of GTP from tubulin to Giα1. Thus, chimera 3 may act as a dominant negative to inhibit the transactivation of Giα by tubulin. Previous studies, as well as data obtained in Figs. 2and 3, suggested that Gα might alter cellular projections containing microtubules (11Roychowdhury S. Panda D. Wilson L. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13485-13490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Roychowdhury S. Wang N. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4955-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Roychowdhury S. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9800-9805Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To test this, Gαi1 and chimeras 1–3 were expressed in COS-1 cells. The expression of each of these chimeras, which was about 3-fold greater than the endogenous Giα, was identified with an antibody against the His6 tag on the protein, and the expression level for each one of the constructs appears to be comparable. This was determined by both the immunostaining seen in the Fig.4 and by Western blot (not shown). Fig. 4also demonstrates the effect that the expression of the various constructs has on the formation of cellular outgrowths (indicated byarrows). Native or vector-transfected COS-1 cells extend moderate length cellular processes that tend to be slightly shorter than the body of the cell (Fig. 4 and Table I). Transfection with Giα1 or chimera 1 increased both the number of cells displaying processes and the mean length of those processes (Table I). Thus, a moderate increase in the expression of Giα increases the length and extent of microtubule-bearing cellular outgrowths. By contrast, chimera 2, which did not bind to tubulin, did not significantly affect cellular outgrowths on COS-1 cells. Both the number and size of processes in chimera 2-transfected cells were similar to control. When cells were transfected with chimera 3, cellular processes were sparse and extremely short (Fig. 4 and Table I). The expression of chimera 3 prevented the transactivation of endogenous Gα by tubulin and prevented cells from sending out these microtubule-rich processes (Fig.4 and Table I).Table INumber and extent of cell process formation in COS 1 cells expressing various chimeric G protein constructsConstructProcesses/cellAvg. process length (% cell body length)Vector2.32 ± 0.4081 ± 25Giα 13.74 ± 0.60138 ± 19Chimera 13.48 ± 0.37118 ± 3Chimera 22.41 ± 0.3592 ± 24Chimera 30.47 ± 0.1737 ± 11COS-1 cells were transfected (calcium phosphate) with constructs indicated and then were fixed with −20°C methanol and stained with rabbit anti-His6 tag and mouse anti-α-tubulin (ICN).

Forty to forty-five cells were counted for each construct from 3 different transfections. A process was defined as an extension from the cell body longer than one third of the cell length.

Data in this study suggest that distinct regions on Gα mediate the binding and the transactivation of Gα protein and tubulin. Giα1 (237–270) plays a crucial role for the transactivation of Giα by tubulin, even though it is not a region required for the binding of those two molecules. Based on the crystal structure of Gα protein, this region includes the helix of α3, a loop, and the β5 strand. The (237–270) domain in Giα1 is one of the binding sites for effectors such as adenylyl cyclase (23Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Similarly, this domain in transducin binds the phosphodiesterase γ subunit allowing activation of retinal phosphodiesterase (31Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. George J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the domain implies that the interaction of Giα1 and tubulin, which evokes transactivation of the later molecule, may play a role in modulating the physiology of signaling pathway and may orchestrate organization of cytoskeleton. The α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins are a family of proteins of 39–52 kDa that display a similarity of about 45–80% at the amino acid level. Previous studies (14Wang N. Yan K. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1239-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that Giα1 bound tubulin with high affinity (KD = 120 nm) and Giα was transactivated by directly transferring GTP. Transducin neither bound tubulin nor was its substrate for transactivation (14Wang N. Yan K. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1239-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, when the Giα1 (215–295) segment replaced the Gtα sequence, chimera 1 could bind to tubulin and was transactivated by transfer of GTP from tubulin in vitro. This suggests that the region 215–295 might be important for mediating Giα1 interaction with tubulin. However, in a manner similar to transducin, chimera 2 did not bind tubulin in vitro. Thus, we initially thought that the Giα1 (237–270) domain might play a key role in rendering Giα1 able to bind tubulinin vitro. Strangely, chimera 3 bound to tubulin with the same high affinity as wild-type Giα1 did. Nonetheless, it appears that chimera 3 inhibited the “productive” association between Giα1 and tubulin, which allows for the transactivation of Giα. Previous studies (14Wang N. Yan K. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1239-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Roychowdhury S. Wang N. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4955-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24Popova J.S. Johnson G.L. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21748-21754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that there may be multiple binding sites on the tubulin dimer for Giα1, and part of the receptor interaction domain of Gα may mediate this binding. Based on data in this study, it is likely that the Giα1 (237–270) domain is involved in the binding of Giα and tubulin; however, there is an additional site (or sites) for Giα1interaction with tubulin, and this is located within 1–215 and 295–354 regions of Giα1. As shown in a solid phase binding assay, replacement of Giα 237–270 with Gtα 237–270 in Giα sequence did not significantly affect the binding affinity of chimera 3 and tubulin (KD ≅ 123 nm for either molecule), implying that this second site(s) is crucial for the high affinity binding of Giα1 to tubulin. Tubulin is able to transfer nucleotide (GTP or AAGTP) directly to various G protein α-subunits (Gsα, Giα1, and Gqα) (13Popova J.S. Garrison J.C. Rhee S.G. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6760-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16Yan K. Popova J.S. Moss A. Shah B. Rasenick M.M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Roychowdhury S. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9800-9805Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This phenomenon has been referred to as transactivation, and during the process nucleotide is not released into the milieu but rather is transferred directly from the tubulin to the G protein α-subunit (19Roychowdhury S. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9800-9805Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It suggests that tubulin activates G proteins by directly transferring GTP to Gα, thus “bypassing” a Gsα-coupled receptor (16Yan K. Popova J.S. Moss A. Shah B. Rasenick M.M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This interaction between Gα and tubulin has led to a hypothesis that the cytoskeleton may participate in the regulation of G protein-signaling pathways. Colchicine, a microtubule depolymerizing agent, potentiated β-adrenoreceptor-stimulated cyclic AMP in lymphoma cells, where activation of the β-adrenergic receptor was obligatory for GTP-activation of adenylyl cyclase (25Insel P.A. Kennedy M.S. Nature. 1978; 273: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In permeable C6 cells, tubulin stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity by transactivating Gsα (16Yan K. Popova J.S. Moss A. Shah B. Rasenick M.M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Exogenous tubulin can also inhibit rat cerebral cortex membrane adenylyl cyclase, apparently by transactivation of Giα1 (18Rasenick M.M. Wang N. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 300-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Roychowdhury S. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9800-9805Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Insertion of Gtα 237–270 into Giα did not alter the GTP binding or the characteristics of binding between Giα and tubulin, but chimera 3 did not serve as a substrate for transactivation by tubulin. Chimera 3 also inhibited GTP transactivation of wild-type Giα (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the Giα 237–270 domain is essential to transfer GTP from tubulin to Giα. Thus, it appears that chimera 3 acts as a dominant negative mutant of Giα1 with regard to the “fruitful” interactions between Giα and tubulin. The domain identified might provide a useful tool to further study and understanding the biologic role of interaction of Giα and tubulin in cells. In COS-1 cells expressing His6-Giα1 and chimeras, it appeared that these proteins were found throughout the cytosol. This may be because the tagged His6 at the end of the N-terminal of Giα1 disrupted the Giα1 associated with plasma membrane (7Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Addition of GFP to the N-terminal of Gsα blocked its association with plasma membrane (6Yu J.Z. Rasenick M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, myristoylated and non-myristoylated Giα bind tubulin with equal affinity and both activate tubulin GTPase, suggesting that they bind to tubulin in a similar fashion (11Roychowdhury S. Panda D. Wilson L. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13485-13490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, the physiologic potential of these Gα constructs may be apparent in these experiments. The considerable difference in effect among these varying constructs of Gα supports this notion. Furthermore, cytosolic Gα may be more relevant to the modulation of microtubule dynamics than membrane-associated Gα. In Dictyostelium, Gα appears cytosolic, and this may help to orient cells in response to a polarizing signal (26Parent C.A. Blacklock B.J. Froehlich W.M. Murphy D.B. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1998; 95: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Microtubules are dynamic structures that undergo assembly and disassembly within the cell. They function both to determine cell shape and in a variety of cell movements, including some forms of cell locomotion, the intracellular transport of organelles, and the separation of chromosomes during mitosis.

Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9800-9805Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have suggested G proteins might participate in modulation of the cytoskeleton. Association between tubulin or microtubules and Gα has been established for some time (14Wang N. Yan K. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1239-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rasenick M.M. Stein P.J. Bitensky M.W. Nature. 1981; 294: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Hagmann J. Fishman P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2659-2662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, overexpression of His6-Giα1 and chimera 1 in COS-1 cells increases the length and number of cellular processes, whereas chimera 2, which does not bind tubulin, had no effect. This is consistent with the notion that the binding and transactivation of Giα1 by tubulin might have a role in the regulation of microtubules. Previous studies also show that Gβγ stabilizes microtubules (4Roychowdhury S. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31576-31581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas Giα1 increases microtubule dynamics by increasing the frequency of microtubule catastrophe (11Roychowdhury S. Panda D. Wilson L. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13485-13490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although these data are from in vitro studies, they are consistent with the possibility that Gα may modulate the dynamics of microtubules in cells. Note that an increase in microtubule dynamics is not inconsistent with increased length and number of cellular processes induced by increased expression of Giα1 or chimera 1. In fact, microtubules in areas of dynamic cellular extension, such as growth cones, display more dynamic behavior (32Lin C.H. Thompson C.A. Forscher P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 5: 640-647Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A recent study (33Sarma T. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Hope T.J. Rasenick M.M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 848-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) has demonstrated an increase in the association of Giα (and Gsα) with microtubules in cellular processes induced by nerve growth factor and other “differentiating” agents in PC12 pheochromacytoma cells. Curiously, expression of chimera 3 blocks the extension of cellular processes. Although it would be premature to suggest that Giα normally accelerates the extension of cellular process thorough its interaction with tubulin, these results are consistent with such a possibility. To draw more specific conclusions, more studies in vitro and in vivo are required. The role of Gα transactivation by tubulin in this process is also unclear. Although transactivation seems pertinent to the regulation of adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C by tubulin (16Yan K. Popova J.S. Moss A. Shah B. Rasenick M.M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Popova J.S. Rasenick M.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2774-2782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its role in regulation of microtubule dynamics is unknown. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that activation of Giα and Gsα has been linked to a rapid increase in microtubule depolymerization (29Panagiotou S. Bakogeorgou E. Papakonstanti E. Hatzoglou A. Wallet F. Dussert C. Stournaras C. Martin P.M. Castanas E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Popova J.S. Greene A.K. Wang J. Rasenick M.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1668-1678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, this study reveals that distinct regions on Gα mediate the tubulin binding and the transactivation process. Giα1 219–295 is important to the binding of Giα1 and tubulin, and Giα 237–270 contributes to the transactivation by tubulin of Giα1. The data in this study implicate Giα1 transactivation by tubulin in the regulation of microtubule organization. Such a regulation might provide new insight into the relationship between hormone or neurotransmitter action and cell morphology or other aspects of the dynamic cytoskeleton.

There are four free cysteine residues (Cys1085, Cys1396, Cys1478, and Cys1635) within apoB48 that potentially can be palmitoylated. All four cysteine residues were substituted with serine by site-specific mutagenesis. The mutant protein was expressed in transfected rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells. Metabolic labeling of the stably transfected cells with iodopalmitic acid analog showed that the mutant apoB48 lacked palmitoylation. The lack of palmitoylation had little impact on the ability of apoB48 to assemble and secrete very low density lipoproteins or high density lipoproteins. Immunocytochemistry experiments using confocal microscopy failed to reveal any major alterations in the intracellular distribution of the mutant apoB48 at steady state. Pulse-chase analysis combined with subcellular fractionation showed no apparent deficiency in the movement of the mutant apoB48 protein from the endoplasmic reticulum tocis/medial Golgi. However, the mutant apoB48 lacking palmitoylation showed retarded movement toward the distal Golgi and increased association (>2-fold) with the membranes of the secretory compartments. A marginal decrease (by 15–20%) in secretion efficiency as compared with that of wild type apoB48 was also observed. These results suggest that lack of palmitoylation may influence the partitioning of apoB48 between microsomal membranes and microsomal lumen, but it does not compromise the ability of apoB48 to assemble lipoproteins.

Expression of hepatic apoB100 is regulated primarily at a post-translational level (1Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1937-1953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proper folding of apoB100 and its association with lipids are assisted by interaction with the chaperone-like protein termed microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (3Dashti N. Gandhi M. Liu X. Lin X. Segrest J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6978-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and by post-translational modifications of the apoB100 polypeptide (4Shelness G.S. Sellers J.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Mutations within the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein gene are associated with abetalipoproteinemia, a genetic disorder characterized by the absence of lipoproteins containing apoB in the plasma (5Berriot-Varoqueaux N. Aggerbeck L.P. Samson-Bouma M. Wetterau J.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 663-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In vitro mutagenesis experiments have shown that the assembly and secretion of lipoproteins containing apoB are markedly affected by abnormal post-translational modification of apoB, including disulfide bond formation (6Huang X.F.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In most of the in vitro experiments, carboxyl terminally truncated apoB forms were used as a model to test the function of apoB post-translational modifications. The mutant apoB proteins display lowered secretion efficiency, enhanced intracellular degradation, and impaired ability to assemble into lipid-rich lipoproteins (6Huang X.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31872-31876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Tran K. Boren J. Macri J. Wang Y. McLeod R. Avramoglu R.K. Adeli K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7244-7251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, since the ability of apoB to recruit lipid in forming VLDL is profoundly influenced by apoB length (10McLeod R.S. Wang Y. Wang S. Rusinol A. Links P. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18445-18455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), some of the apoB truncates used in the mutagenesis studies were too short to assemble VLDL (6Huang X.F.

Cell. 2000; 11: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For example, the apoB truncation mutant used in the palmitoylation experiments was apoB29 (the amino-terminal 29% of the full-length apoB100), which has no ability to form VLDL and can only form small, dense particles resembling that of high density lipoproteins (HDL). Therefore, the functional consequence of palmitoylation of apoB in VLDL assembly and secretion remains unclear. apolipoprotein very low density lipoproteins high density lipoproteins endoplasmic reticulum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum apolipoprotein very low density lipoproteins high density lipoproteins endoplasmic reticulum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum Palmitoylation of human apoB has been observed in cultured human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells (11Hoeg J.M.

Cell. 2000; 11: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, the 16-carbon fatty acid palmitate is covalently linked to cysteine residues via thioester bonds (reviewed in Refs. 13Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 14Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). There are 25 cysteine residues within apoB100, of which 16 are involved in the formation of eight disulfide bonds (15Yang C.Y. Kim T.W. Weng S.A. Lee B.R. Yang M.L. Gotto Jr., A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5523-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One free cysteine residue at the carboxyl terminus of apoB100 is involved in covalent linkage with apolipoprotein (a) (16Gabel B. Yao Z. McLeod R.S. Young S.G. Koschinsky M.L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the remaining eight cysteine residues can potentially be modified by palmitic acid. The exact number of palmitic acids that are covalently linked to apoB100 is uncertain (17Huang G. Lee D.M. Singh S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1395-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Experiments with apoB100 secreted from HepG2 cells showed that there were three moles of palmitic acid per mole of apoB100 (11Hoeg J.M. Meng M.S. Ronan R. Demosky Jr., S.J. Fairwell T. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1215-1220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One study with apoB29 has mapped a palmitoylation site to Cys1085, which is the only free cysteine residue within apoB29 (9Zhao Y. McCabe J.B. Vance J. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation is likely catalyzed enzymatically by a cytosolic palmitoyl acyl transferase in cells but can also be achieved non-enzymatically in vitro(12Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 18Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the secretory protein apoB100 gets palmitoylated by a cytosolic enzyme is unknown. In rat hepatic cells, both apoB100 and apoB48 can form VLDL that contains a single copy of apoB100 or apoB48. Kinetic analysis indicates that the assembly of B48-VLDL (19Stillemark P. Boren J. Andersson M. Larsson T. Rustaeus S. Karlsson K.A. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10506-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and B100-VLDL (20Tran K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 31187-31200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) is achieved post-translationally in post-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartments. The stepwise assembly of lipids with apoB appears to be initiated when the apoB polypeptide is membrane-bound in the microsomes. Thus, association of apoB with membrane represents an important step in the VLDL assembly dynamics. The mechanisms by which apoB-membrane interaction is achieved or regulated are currently unclear. One possibility is covalent conjugation of fatty acyl chains with the apoB polypeptides. Recent experiments using McA-RH7777 cells transfected with a carboxyl terminally truncated apoB, apoB29, showed that abolishing palmitoylation of apoB29 resulted in impaired lipoprotein assembly and abnormal intracellular distribution of the mutant protein (9Zhao Y. McCabe J.B. Vance J. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The non-palmitoylated apoB29 proteins were secreted as dense lipoprotein particles and were accumulated in the Golgi apparatus (9Zhao Y. McCabe J.B. Vance J. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These results are the first indication of functional consequences of apoB polypeptides lacking palmitoylation. However, since apoB29 can only assemble HDL-like lipoproteins, this truncated apoB form did not offer the opportunity to investigate the role of palmitoylation in the assembly and secretion of VLDL. We reasoned that if palmitoylation plays a role in the assembly and secretion of VLDL, then apoB forms longer than apoB29 and, having the ability to assemble VLDL, would be a more suitable model. It has been well documented that the naturally occurring truncated form apoB48 has the ability to form VLDL in the rat liver. In the current study, we used apoB48 to assess the role of apoB palmitoylation in VLDL assembly and secretion. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Sigma. ProMixTM (a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, 1000 Ci/mmol), protein A-SepharoseTM CL-4B beads and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Protease inhibitor mixture and chemiluminescent blotting substrate were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Monoclonal antibody 1D1 raised against human apoB was a gift of R. Milne and Y. Marcel (University of Ottawa Heart Institute). Antibody against α-mannosidase II was a gift of M. Farquhar (University of California, San Diego, CA). The anti-calnexin and anti-TGN38 antibodies were obtained from StressGenand Affinity BioReagents, respectively. The plasmid encoding wild type apoB48 (pB48wt) was prepared using the expression vector pCMV5. The coding sequences encompassing nucleotides 20–6668 of the human apoB cDNA were excised from the published pB48 (21Hussain M.M. Zhao Y. Kancha R.K. Blackhart B.D. Yao Z. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) by digestion with EcoRI and MluI. The EcoRI-MluI fragment was inserted into the polylinker region of pCMV5. The resulting pB48wt plasmid encodes the signal peptide and the amino-terminal 2152 amino acids of human apoB100. The Cys-to-Ser substitution was introduced into pB48wt at Cys1085, Cys1395, Cys1478, and Cys1635, consecutively, using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Inc.) (Fig. 1A). Sequences of all primers used for mutagenesis are shown in Table I. The resulting plasmids pB48C1085, pB48C1085–1395, pB48C1085–1478, and pB48C1085–1635 were purified in a CsCl gradient. The integrity of the coding sequence for each apoB construct was authenticated through bidirectional sequencing of the plasmid template using a total of 17 pairs of amplification primers and then in turn using these to prime direct sequencing reactions that were run on an Applied Biosystems Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer.Table IOligonucleotides used for Cys-to-Ser mutagenesisOligonucleotideSequence1-aAll sequences are shown from 5′ to 3′.

Transfection of the cells with expression plasmids encoding wild type or mutant forms of apoB48 was achieved using the previously described calcium phosphate precipitation method (22Blackhart B.D. Yao Z.M. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8358-8360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the recombinant proteins was verified by immunoblotting of the conditioned media using monoclonal antibody 1D1 (23Milne R.W. Theolis Jr., R. Verdery R.B. Marcel Y.L.

Vance J. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, stable cell lines were pulse-labeled for 4 h with [125I]iodopalmitate (100–250 μCi in 5 ml) and chased for 16 h in serum-free DMEM. At the end of chase, the medium was collected and concentrated. The concentrated media were delipidated using chloroform:methanol, and the delipidated samples were dissolved in buffer (4% SDS, 40% glycerol, 65 mmdithiothreitol in 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.5) prior to PAGE. Incorporation of [125I]iodopalmitate into secreted apoB48 was visualized using phosphorimaging. Pulse-chase experiments (with [35S]methionine/cysteine) for determination of apoB synthesis and secretion were performed as described previously (7Tran K. Boren J. Macri J. Wang Y. McLeod R.

The results were expressed as percent of the initial counts of35S-labeled apoB at the end of pulse labeling. Cells were continuously labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 2 h in DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum and 0.4 mm oleate. The media were fractionated into VLDL1, VLDL2, and other lipoproteins by rate flotation ultracentrifugation in a KBr density gradient as described previously (24Wang Y. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12272-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The apoB proteins in each fraction were immunoprecipitated (using an anti-apoB polyclonal antibody that recognized both human and rat apoB) and subjected to PAGE and fluorography. In experiments where secreted apoB mass was determined, cells were incubated for 2 h in DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum and 0.4 mm oleate. The media were fractionated in a KBr density gradient as above, and apoB proteins in each fraction were immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal anti-apoB antibody, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblot analysis using the monoclonal antibody 1D1. Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 15–30 min and chased for indicated times as described in figure legends. At the end of chase, cells were homogenized using a ball-bearing homogenizer (25Tran K. Wang Y. DeLong C.J. Cui Z. Yao Z. J. Biol.

The postnuclear supernatant was prepared and fractionated into ER, cis/medial Golgi and distal Golgi by ultracentrifugation using a preformed Nycodenz gradient (37,000 rpm, 90 min, 15 °C, Beckman SW41 rotor). A total of 15 fractions (0.8 ml/fraction) were collected, and an aliquot of each fraction was subjected to PAGE and immunoblotted to detect α-mannosidase II, calnexin, TGN38, and apoB, respectively (20Tran K.

The lumenal and membrane-associated apoB proteins were analyzed by PAGE and fluorography as described above. Cells were plated on coverslips and fixed with paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline as described previously (20Tran K.

Monoclonal antibody 1D1 was used to probe the recombinant human apoB; ER and Golgi were probed with anti-calnexin and anti-α-mannosidase II antibodies, respectively (20Tran K. Thorne-Tjomsland G.

The experiments were performed using both transiently transfected McA-RH7777 cells and individually selected G418-resistant colonies. Of the nine free cysteine residues in apoB100, four are located within the amino-terminal 48% of the protein (Fig.1A, solid ovals). We used apoB48, a naturally occurring form of apoB that can assemble VLDL, to study the role of palmitoylation in VLDL assembly. The four cysteine residues Cys1085, Cys1395, Cys1479, and Cys1635 within apoB48 were substituted with serine residues by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig.1A, opened ovals), and the resulting cDNA constructs were transfected into McA-RH7777 cells. In stably transfected cell lines, the mutant apoB48 proteins, namely B48C1085, B48C1085–1395, B48C1085–1478, and B48C1085–1635, were secreted with the expected molecular mass and reacted with monoclonal antibody 1D1 that was specific for human apoB (Fig. 1B,bottom panel). Palmitoylation of the apoB proteins was determined by [125I]iodopalmitate labeling. Preliminary experiments with parental McA-RH7777 cells showed that the endogenous rat apoB100 was secreted as palmitoylated proteins (data not shown), which agrees with the previous report (9Zhao Y. McCabe J.B. Vance J. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). [125I]Iodopalmitate labeling experiments showed that B48C1085–1635, in which all free cysteine residues were mutagenized, was expectedly non-palmitoylated (Fig. 1B,top panel). In contrast, palmitoylation occurred in the wild type apoB48 (B48wt) and B48C1085, B48C1085–1395, and B48C1085–1478 mutants containing one or more free cysteine residues. Palmitoylation of the endogenous rat apoB48 was below the limit of detection (Fig.1B, lane labeled with McA). The intensity of [125I]iodopalmitate labeling of the recombinant mutant apoB48 proteins decreased gradually as the number of mutated cysteine residues increased (Fig. 1B, top panel), suggesting the presence of multiple palmitoylation sites within human apoB48. As shown previously, apoB48 could form VLDL as well as HDL-like particles in McA-RH7777 cells, and the formation of B48-VLDL was dependent on exogenous oleate (10McLeod R.S. Wang Y. Wang S. Rusinol A. Links P. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18445-18455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The culture media in all subsequent experiments was therefore supplemented with 20% FBS and 0.4 mm oleate to maximize lipogenesis and VLDL assembly/secretion. Having ascertained that B48C1085–1635was non-palmitoylated, we examined the effect of lack of palmitoylation on the assembly and secretion of VLDL. Cell lines expressing comparable levels of B48wt or B48C1085–1635 were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine, and the conditioned media were fractionated by rate flotation centrifugation to separate VLDL1 (Rf > 100) and VLDL2 (Rf 20–100) from dense lipoproteins (Fig. 2A). Both B48wt and B48C1085–1635 were secreted predominantly (>80%) as HDL-like particles and a small proportion as VLDL. Quantification of 35S-labeled B48wt and B48C1085–1635 showed that the lack of palmitoylation had little impact on the density distribution among different lipoprotein fractions (Fig. 2B). Secretion of VLDL containing endogenous rat 35S-labeled apoB100 was also similar between B48wt- and B48C1085–1635-transfected cells. These results were the first indication that palmitoylation of apoB48 was not essential for the assembly and secretion of VLDL. To confirm that palmitoylation was not required for B48-VLDL secretion, we determined secretion of the apoB48 mass by immunoblotting (Fig. 2C). We also fractionated the medium lipoproteins by ultracentrifugation in a salt gradient that was designed to resolve HDL subfractions (9Zhao Y. McCabe J.B. Vance J. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Fig.2D). In either case (Fig. 2, C and D), there was no apparent difference in the secretion of VLDL or HDL between B48wt- and B48C1085–1635-transfected cells. Furthermore, there was no indication of a requirement of palmitoylation for B48-VLDL secretion from B48C1085-, B48C1085–1395-, or B48C1085–1478-transfected cells (Fig. 2E). Thus, abolishing palmitoylation of B48 was not associated with impairment in B48-VLDL secretion. We next contrasted secretion efficiency between B48wt and B48C1085–1635 by pulse-chase experiments (Fig.3A). In two independent experiments, the secretion efficiency (i.e. the percent of total newly synthesized apoB48 that was secreted during chase) for B48C1085–1635 was reproducibly lower (by 15–25%) than that of B48wt (top panel). Concomitantly, a slightly increased B48C1085–1635 (by 20%) compared with B48wt was retained within the cells during chase (bottom panel). The recovery of total apoB48 (medium + cell) was similar between B48wt and B48C1085–1635, suggesting that the decreased B48C1085–1635 secretion was not accompanied with enhanced intracellular degradation. Similar pulse-chase experiments were also performed with cells expressing B48C1085, B48C1085–1395 or B48C1085–1478 (Fig. 3B). The secretion efficiency of the mutant apoB48 proteins decreased gradually as the number of mutagenized free cysteine residues increased (Fig.3B, bottom). Once again, the decreased secretion of apoB48 mutants was accompanied with prolonged intracellular retention (Fig. 3B, top). These data indicate that although the ability of apoB48 to assemble VLDL is unimpaired by the lack of palmitoylation, the secretion efficiency of the mutant proteins is somewhat slightly reduced. It was reported that mutant apoB29 lacking palmitoylation exhibited an abnormal accumulation within the Golgi apparatus (9Zhao Y. McCabe J.B. Vance J. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The prolonged intracellular retention of B48C1085–1635 shown by pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 3A) prompted us to examine intracellular distribution of this mutant protein. To this end, we performed indirect double immunofluorescent co-localization experiments (Fig. 4). Confocal images showed that both B48wt and B48C1085–1635 appeared as punctate staining throughout the cells with high intensity near the perinuclear area (Fig. 4, A and B, left panels, labeled with apoB). Merging of fluorescence derived from apoB with that from calnexin (middle panels, labeled withCNX) and α-mannosidase II (middle panels, labeled with ManII), respectively, showed substantial co-localization of apoB48 (wild type and mutant) with the ER and the Golgi markers (Fig. 4, right panels, labeled withoverlay). There was no discernible difference that could suggest the lack of palmitoylation resulting in abnormal intracellular distribution of B48C1085–1635 at steady state. The immunocytochemistry experiments were performed in both stably and transiently transfected cells. Under no circumstances had different intracellular distribution between B48wt and B48C1085–1635been observed (data from transiently transfected cells are not shown). The immunocytochemistry data were corroborated by subcellular fractionation experiments in which the microsomes were separated using a Nycodenz gradient. Immunoblot analysis with anti-calnexin, anti-α-mannosidase II, and anti-TGN38 antibody was performed to detect ER, cis/medial Golgi, and distal Golgi markers, respectively (Fig. 5A), and antibody 1D1 was used to probe apoB48 (Fig. 5B). Quantification of the intracellular distribution of apoB48 among the Nycodenz fractions showed almost identical profiles between B48C1085–1635 and B48wt (Fig. 5C). These results together indicate that the decreased secretion efficiency of mutant B48C1085–1635 was not associated with abnormal intracellular distribution at steady state.Figure 5Distribution of apoB48 along the secretory pathway. Cells (100-mm dish, 80% confluent) expressing B48 or B48C1085–1635 were incubated in DMEM containing 20% FBS and 0.4 mm oleate for 2 h.

Preliminary experiments showed that the majority of microsome-associated 35S-labeled apoB48 was present in the lumen (see below). Thus, in this experiment, we monitored trafficking of the lumenal35S-labeled apoB48 through different subcellular compartments. At the end of the 30-min pulse, the ER lumenal35S-labeled B48wt and 35S-labeled B48C1085–1635 were predominately associated with HDL-like particles (Fig. 6, A and B, top panels, labeled with ER). Because protein synthesis was not synchronized under the current experimental conditions, some apoB48-HDL particles were found in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus (panels labeled with cis/medial Golgi anddistal Golgi) and were released into the media at the end of the 30-min pulse. However, no 35S-labeled apoB48 was associated with VLDL at this time. After the 45-min chase (bottom panels), the 35S-labeled apoB48 exited the ER, became prominent in the distal Golgi, and was secreted into the media. A small proportion of 35S-labeled B48 was associated with VLDL within the distal Golgi lumen, but35S-labeled B48-VLDL was never observed in the ER lumen. The presence of B48-VLDL, particularly B48-VLDL1, in the distal Golgi lumen, at the end of the 45-min chase is consistent with a post-translational, post-ER process for B48-VLDL assembly (19Stillemark P. Boren J. Andersson M. Larsson T. Rustaeus S. Karlsson K.A. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10506-10513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Similar to what was observed in continuous labeling experiments (Fig.2A), secretion of 35S-labeled B48C1085–1635 as VLDL and HDL was also comparable to that of 35S-labeled B48wt at the end of chase (Fig. 6, compare panels labeled with medium), again indicting that the lack of palmitoylation has no effect on the ability of apoB48 to assemble lipoproteins. Notably, the lumenal 35S-labeled B48C1085–1635 presented in different subcellular compartments was markedly lower than 35S-labeled B48wt at the end of both pulse and chase time (Fig. 6, compare panel A with B). The reduced lumenal B48C1085–1635 during the pulse-chase period (Fig. 6) raised the possibility that the mutant protein might bind to microsomal membranes with high affinity. We hypothesized that the decreased secretion efficiency and prolonged intracellular retention of B48C1085–1635 was attributable to altered membrane association. In the next pulse-chase experiment, we compared membrane-association property together with the trafficking rate between B48wt and B48C1085–1635 (Fig.7). The pulse time was reduced to 15 min (from the previous 30 min); thus at the beginning of chase the 35S-labeled apoB48 was mainly confined to the ER (seeinsets of panels labeled with time 0). Moreover, two extra time points, 15-min and 30-min, were added to the chase (in addition to the previous single 45-min point) to monitor the rate of intracellular trafficking of apoB48. As the chase proceeded from 0 to 45 min, the radioactivity associated with apoB48 moved out from the ER lumen and appeared in the distal Golgi lumen, and no apoB48 was accumulated in the cis/medial Golgi (Fig. 7, Aand B, left panels). These results, together with the data shown in Fig. 6, indicate that apoB48 was transported mainly in a lumenal HDL-associated form from the ER to distal Golgi, and it passed through cis/medial Golgi rather rapidly. When association of apoB48 with membranes was determined, it became clear that B48C1085–1635 had increased (by at least 2-fold) membrane binding. At the end of the 15-min pulse, 26% of the total ER-associated 35S-labeled B48C1085–1635was membrane-bound, whereas only 11% of the total35S-labeled B48wt was membrane-bound. The elevated membrane association of 35S-labeled B48C1085–1635 was observed throughout the entire chase (Fig. 7, A andB, right panels). Thus, the average values of membrane-associated apoB48 in the combined ER,cis/medial Golgi, and distal Golgi fractions from four chase time points (i.e. 0, 15, 30, and 45 min) were 29.8 ± 3.0% for B48C1085–1635 and 10.5 ± 1.3% for B48wt (p < 0.001). The increased association of B48C1085–1635 with the membranes was accompanied with reduced lumenal form in all subcellular compartments (Fig. 7B, left panel). The percent of total 35S-labeled B48C1085–1635presented in the lumen of all subcellular compartments was less than that of 35S-labeled B48wt at every chase time point. The average values of lumenal apoB48 in the combined ER,cis/medial Golgi, and distal Golgi fractions from four chase time points were 70.3 ± 3.0% for B48C1085–1635 and 89.5 ± 1.3% for B48wt (p < 0.001). Notably, the proportion of total B48C1085–1635 as lumenal form in the distal Golgi was lower than that of B48wt (compare the left panels between A and B, inverted triangles), whereas the proportion of total B48C1085–1635 as membrane-associated form in thecis/medial Golgi was more pronounced than that of B48wt (compare the right panels between Aand B, opened circles). Thus, while B48C1085–1635 exited the ER at a rate similar to that of B48wt, B48C1085–1635 (particularly the membrane-bound form) might have a slightly reduced transit rate betweencis/medial Golgi and distal Golgi. Consideration was given to the possibility that multiple Cys-to-Ser substitution within apoB48 could have effects that extended beyond loss of palmitoylation. Hence, it was desirable to confirm the mutagenesis data using other approaches. It has been reported that 2-bromopalmitate inhibits palmitoylation (26Webb Y. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). We attempted to block apoB palmitoylation using 2-bromopalmitate and found that it indiscriminately inhibited secretion of both B48wt (Fig. 8A) and B48C1085–1635 as VLDL (Fig. 8B) in a dose-dependent manner. Secretion of B48wt or B48C1085–1635 as HDL-like particles was less affected by the treatment (Fig. 8). Secretion of endogenous rat35S-labeled apoB100 was also inhibited by 2-bromopalmitate treatment (data not shown). The treatment with 2-bromopalmitate had no effect on apoB synthesis as judged by the equal incorporation of35S-labeled amino acids into B48wt and B48C1085–1635 at different doses of the inhibitor (Fig.8C). Apparently, 2-bromopalmitate exerts an inhibitory effect on VLDL assembly and secretion independent of apoB palmitoylation. Multiple functional roles have been assigned to post-translational protein palmitoylation. Palmitoylation results in anchoring and targeting otherwise cytosolic proteins to the inner surface of specific membrane domains (27Garcia-Cardena G. Oh P. Liu J. Schnitzer J.E. Sessa W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6448-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 28Shaul P.W. Smart E.J. Robinson L.J. German Z. Yuhanna I.S. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. Michel T. J. Biol.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation also governs protein-protein interactions within membranes (12Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 18Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 30Moffett S.

The reversibility of protein palmitoylation suggests that it may regulate membrane activities. While extensive protein palmitoylation studies have focused on proteins involved in signal transduction, the role of palmitoylation of apoB, one of the rare secretory proteins that can be palmitoylated, is not entirely clear. To date, only one report has suggested that substituting the single free cysteine (Cys1085) with serine in apoB29 results in impaired lipid recruitment and abnormal accumulation of the mutant protein within the Golgi apparatus (9Zhao Y. McCabe J.B. Vance J. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the current study, we used the naturally occurring apoB48 as a model to assess the role of apoB palmitoylation in VLDL assembly and secretion. Unexpectedly, results obtained from our biochemical (Fig. 2) and immunocytochemical experiments (Fig. 4) using both transiently and stably transfected cells do not support the notion that lack of palmitoylation in apoB48 results in impaired lipoprotein assembly or secretion. In an attempt to determine the effect of palmitoylation using a chemical inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate, we observed that this compound inhibited VLDL secretion regardless of the status of apoB palmitoylation (Fig. 8). Thus, the use of apoB48 as a model leads us to conclude that apoB palmitoylation within this truncated apoB form does not play a role in VLDL assembly and secretion. The lack of a gross effect of apoB palmitoylation on VLDL assembly/secretion does not rule out a possible temporal and spatial role that this post-translational modification plays during intracellular apoB trafficking and VLDL assembly. Recent studies with the full-length apoB100 have shown that the VLDL assembly proceeds through membrane-associated apoB100 in the ER and cis/medial Golgi to eventual acquisition of bulk neutral lipids in a compartment close to distal Golgi (20Tran K. Thorne-Tjomsland G. DeLong C.J. Cui Z. Shan J. Burton L. Jamieson J.C. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31187-31200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The physical nature of the apoB100-membrane interaction during VLDL assembly is unclear. One hypothesis is that covalently linked fatty acid may facilitate the interaction between apoB100 and membranes (6Huang X.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31872-31876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, we performed detailed pulse-chase experiments in conjunction with subcellular fractionation to determine the rate of intracellular trafficking and membrane association of the mutant B48C1085–1635 and contrasted these parameters with those of B48wt. The following two observations are noteworthy. First, although immunocytochemistry (Fig. 4) and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5) of the fractionated microsomes failed to detect gross changes in intracellular distribution of the mutant apoB48, two independent pulse-chase experiments reproducibly revealed slightly lowered secretion efficiency and prolonged intracellular retention of B48C1085–1635 (Fig. 3A). The effect of palmitoylation on apoB48 secretion appeared to be a function of the extent of this S-acylation. Thus, the more free cysteine residues are mutagenized, the lower the secretion efficiency and the greater intracellular retention of the mutant apoB48 proteins (Fig.3B). Furthermore, the low secretion efficiency of B48C1085–1635 was associated with slightly reduced transit rate between cis/medial Golgi and distal Golgi (Fig. 7). Thus, palmitoylation of apoB may exert a subtle effect in fine-tuning the kinetics of intracellular trafficking. Second, the lack of palmitoylation did not diminish association of apoB48 with the microsomal membranes. Rather, the mutant B48C1085–1635 exhibited enhanced binding to the membranes of the secretory compartments (Fig. 7). These results suggest that the normally observed apoB-membrane interaction is probably mediated by factors other than apoB palmitoylation. As mentioned above, the physical nature of apoB-membrane interaction is currently unclear. However, the present studies with apoB48 revealed a marked distinction between apoB100 and apoB48 in their membrane association during lipoprotein assembly. In the case of apoB100, the newly synthesized proteins were almost exclusively membrane-associated within the ER and only became lumen-borne when they reached distal Golgi as VLDL (20Tran K. Thorne-Tjomsland G. DeLong C.J. Cui Z. Shan J. Burton L. Jamieson J.C. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31187-31200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, the majority of newly synthesized apoB48 was present in the lumen, while only a small proportion was membrane-associated throughout the secretory compartments (Fig. 7). The difference in membrane association between apoB100 and apoB48 is striking, which may indicate that the carboxyl-terminal half of the apoB100 amino acid sequences governs apoB membrane binding. An important unsolved issue in studies of VLDL assembly is how the membrane-associated lipoprotein precursor particles recruit lipid and eventually “fall-off” the membrane as mature, soluble, lipid-loaded lipoprotein particles that are secretion-competent. Since there are an additional five free cysteine residues located within the carboxyl-terminal half of apoB100 and at least four of which can potentially be palmitoylated, it is of importance to determine further, using the full-length apoB100 as a model, whether or not the fatty acids conjugated onto apoB can act as the link that regulates apoB association/dissociation with the membrane during apoB100-VLDL assembly.

The newly synthesized MHC class II is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to acidic compartments as the complex with an invariant chain (Ii). In that complex, the peptide binding groove of MHC class II is occupied by the CLIP, which is part of Ii (1Cresswell P. Annu. Rev.

The antigenic peptides derived from endocytosed proteins, which have been digested by cathepsins into 15–20-amino acid segments, are then loaded onto the peptide-binding groove of the MHC class II in exchange for the CLIP, at an endosomal pH (3Mellman I.

The role of the acidic pH is considered to enhance the peptide exchange reaction rate as well as to provide a suitable reaction condition for cathepsins. Finally, the peptide-MHC class II complex is transported from the acidic compartments to the cell surface for the interaction with T cell receptors (6Davis M.M. Boniface J.J. Reich Z. Lyons D. Hampl J. Arden B. Chien Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 523-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The acidic pH can change the properties of MHC class II molecules and accelerate the peptide exchange, because of the faster association and/or dissociation reactions (7Sette A. Southwood S.

To understand the pH-dependent functions of MHC class II molecules, it is essential to study their thermodynamic and structural properties. Previous thermal stability analyses have determined the energetic consequences of an alteration in the pH (10Reich Z. Altman J.D. Boniface J.J. Lyons D.S. Kozono H. Ogg G. Morgan C. Davis M.M. Proc.

As compared with other MHC class II molecules, the peptide binding to I-Ek is most affected by pH (7Sette A. Southwood S. O'Sullivan D. Gaeta F.C. Sidney J. Grey H.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 844-851PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of the fluorescent dye 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid, a probe for exposed nonpolar sites, to I-Ek was enhanced by an acidic pH, indicating that the acidic environment is associated with an increase in the exposed hydrophobicity in class II molecules (12Boniface J.J.

The crystal structures of I-Ek-Hb and its mutants have been determined, and the structural difference between the acidic and neutral pH values has also been discussed in relation with the peptide exchange mechanism (11Wilson N. Fremont D. Marrack P. Kappler J. Immunity. 2001; 14: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Fremont D.H. Hendrickson W.A. Marrack P. Kappler J.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 3345-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Together with the biochemical analyses, the conformational change from a “closed” to an “open” form is considered to occur at low pH and to be critical for the function. Thus, I-Ek may be a good target for further thermodynamic characterizations and for studying their relation to the structural features. DSC analyses can provide accurate thermodynamic parameters, such as the calorimetric enthalpy change (ΔHcal) and the entropy change (ΔS), in addition to the denaturation temperature (Td) and the van't Hoff enthalpy change (ΔHvH), which are also obtained in circular dichroism (CD) measurements. It is interesting to determine the energetic contribution to the increased stability of MHC class II molecules at low pH relative to that at neutral pH (10Reich Z. Altman J.D. Boniface J.J. Lyons D.S. Kozono H. Ogg G. Morgan C. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2495-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which can explain the structural and functional differences. Additionally, to analyze the irreversible thermal denaturation of I-Ek-Hb, the kinetically controlled heat capacity functions were used for the extraction of equilibrium parameters (17Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Mateo P.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Because reversible denaturation is limited to small, compact proteins, the evaluation of irreversible transitions will be more important to analyze structure-function relationships in the present post-genome era. Under the same conditions used for DSC measurements, with little interference from the irreversible process, the thermodynamic parameters can be quantitatively determined and compared as a function of pH. Baculovirus-infected insect cells, Sf9, were used to produce soluble I-Ek molecules with the Hb peptide, 64–76, linked to the N terminus of the β subunit via flexible linker, as described previously (18Kozono H. Parker D. White J. Marrack P. Kappler J. Immunity. 1995; 3: 187-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Kozono H. White J. Clements J. Marrack P. Kappler J. Nature. 1994; 369: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The I-Ek-Hb molecule was secreted into the medium and was purified by immunoaffinity column chromatography with 14-4-4S, a monoclonal anti-MHC class II antibody, followed by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (16 mm × 60 cm, Amersham Biosciences). The purified fractions were pooled, and the buffer was exchanged to an appropriate buffer. The protein concentrations were determined from UV absorption at 280 nm and were calculated by using an absorption coefficient of 1.23 cm2 mg−1, which was estimated from the amino acid composition of I-Ek-Hb. Far-UV CD spectra of I-Ek-Hb were measured on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter. The protein concentration was 0.36 mg/ml, and the optical path length was 0.1 cm. Spectra for CD between 200 and 250 nm were obtained in 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl at 20 °C using a scanning speed of 10 nm min−1, a time response of 2 s, a band width of 1 nm, and an average over 5 scans. DSC experiments were carried out on a Microcal MCS DSC calorimeter. All solutions (10 mmphosphate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl or 10 mm MOPS buffer containing 150 mm NaCl) were carefully degassed before the measurements. Data were collected in the temperature range between 20 and 90 °C at various heating rates, 0.2, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 °C min−1. The protein concentration was in the range from 0.08 to 0.43 mg ml−1. The analyses were done by a non-linear least-square method, as described in the DSC analysis software Microcal Origin version 4.1. The ΔHcal was calculated by integrating the area in each heat capacity curve. The van't Hoff enthalpy change (ΔHvH) was calculated by the next equation for assuming the two-state transition, ΔHvH(Td)=4RTd2Cp(Td)ΔHcal(Td)Eq. 1 where Cp is the molar excess heat capacity, and R is the gas constant. Using the ΔCp values with the ΔHcaland Td values, the Gibbs free energy of unfolding as a function of temperature, ΔGd(T), could be calculated from the following equation.ΔGd(T)=ΔHcal(Td)1−TTd−ΔCpTlnTTd−ΔCp(Td−T)Eq. 2 A rate-limiting irreversible unfolding is assumed to follow a reversible transition (20Lumry R.

A detailed theoretical analysis for irreversible denaturation has been reported previously (17Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Mateo P.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The four methods, A, B, C, and D, were applied to determine the activation parameters for denaturation of I-Ek-Hb in this study. The rate constant, k2, is obtained at each temperature from the next equation, k2=rCpΔHcal−ΔHEq. 5 where r is the heating rate in kelvin per second, and ΔH is the corresponding enthalpy change at a given temperature. The activation energy is obtained from the Arrhenius plot,k2=Aexp−EaRT*Eq. 6 where A = exp (Ea/RT*). The variation of Td withr is given by the following equation. r(Td)2=AREaexp(−EaRTd)Eq. 7 The dependence of the enthalpy evolved with temperature is expressed by the following equation. lnlnΔHcalΔHcal−ΔH=EaR1Td−1TEq. 8 The activation energy can be calculated from the heat capacity at Td,Cp(Td), by the following equation. Ea=eRCp(Td)Td2ΔHcalEq. 9 To eliminate the binding of endogenous peptides to I-Ek during its expression, the Hb peptide was attached by a flexible linker to the N terminus of the I-Ek β subunit, and the soluble molecule, I-Ek-Hb, was purified as a single peak on gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography analysis, corresponding to the αβ heterodimer (Fig.1A). The SDS-PAGE analysis also revealed the purity of the I-Ek-Hb molecule to be over 95%. The far-UV CD spectra of I-Ek-Hb were similar to those of I-Ek, reported previously (12Boniface J.J. Lyons D.S. Wettstein D.A. Allbritton N.L. Davis M.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and showed that the secondary structure was not grossly altered as a function of pH (Fig. 1B). For DSC measurements at mildly acidic and neutral pH values, the I-Ek-Hb molecule was first dissolved in phosphate buffer, because of its lower enthalpy change for the deprotonation and its lower temperature dependence (21Fukada H. Takahashi K. Proteins. 1998; 33: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows the excess heat capacity curves as a function of pH, at a heating rate of 1 °C per min. All curves were irreversible as shown by the lack of reproduced excess heat capacity in the second scanning, as described below. The small transition ranges of about 10 °C indicated the high cooperativity of this transition. Assuming the two-state transition, the thermodynamic parameters for denaturation of I-Ek-Hb were determined, and are summarized in Table I. It should be noted that the stability at the mildly acidic pH is higher than that at the neutral pH. The correlation between Td and ΔHcal could be classified into two groups, one for the mildly acidic pH and the other for the neutral pH (Fig.3). The heat capacity change (ΔCp), determined from this correlation, is 11.1 kJ mol−1 K−1 for the mildly acidic pH and that of the neutral pH is 15.9 kJ mol−1K−1.Table IThermodynamic parameters for denaturation of I-Ek-Hb as a function of pHpHConcentrationTdΔHcalΔHvHΔHcal/ΔHvHmg ml−1°CkJ mol−15.00.4374.87166821.05.50.3475.47237021.06.00.3374.97186651.16.50.3272.88136521.27.40.3367.27446001.28.00.3362.76515651.2The heating rate was 1.0 °C per min.

To evaluate the protonation effects on the buffer and the protein (22Baker B.M. Murphy K.P. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2049-2055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar,23Petrosian S.A. Makhatadze G.I. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the thermodynamic stability of I-Ek-Hb, in a buffer with a large heat of ionization, MOPS, was also analyzed using DSC. Because the pH of MOPS buffer is largely dependent on the temperature (21Fukada H. Takahashi K. Proteins. 1998; 33: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), the pH at the Td of the buffer used in this study was determined and applied to compare the thermodynamics in the phosphate buffer described above. TableII summarizes the thermodynamic parameters obtained in MOPS buffer. The thermal stability at an acidic pH is higher than that at a neutral pH, which is similar to the stability in the phosphate buffer. The ΔHcalvalues in MOPS buffer are relatively smaller than those in phosphate buffer. This difference should be because of the protonation effects on the buffer and the protein.Table IIThermodynamic parameters for denaturation of I-Ek-Hb in MOPS bufferpHpHConcentrationTdΔHcalat 25 °Cat Tdmg ml−1°CkJ mol−16.55.50.3375.26827.06.00.3373.66817.46.50.3370.67947.77.00.5068.5677The heating rate was 1.0 °C per min. Open table in a new tab The heating rate was 1.0 °C per min. To analyze whether the protein concentration used in the present DSC measurements has an effect on the thermal denaturation, mainly because of the irreversibility, the thermodynamic parameters were determined as a function of concentration (Table III). Within the range from 0.08 to 0.33 mg ml−1 at pH 7.4, both Td and ΔH values were independent of the protein concentration.Table IIIThermodynamic parameters for denaturation of I-Ek-Hb at pH 7.4 as a function of protein concentrationConcentrationTdΔHcalΔHvHΔHcal/ΔHvHmg ml−1°CkJ mol−10.0866.97446081.20.1865.97565931.30.333-aData were taken from Table I.67.27446001.2The heating rate was 1.0 °C per min.3-a Data were taken from Table I. Open table in a new tab The heating rate was 1.0 °C per min. To determine the temperature range in which the unfolding of I-Ek-Hb is predominantly irreversible, the heating was stopped at various temperatures and the solution was subsequently cooled to 20 °C, followed by the next heating (Fig.4). These heat capacity curves showed that the irreversible step occurs early in the DSC scans at both pH 5.5 and 7.4. Thus, the calorimetric traces have to be analyzed according to an irreversible model. We carried out DSC experiments at different heating rates, 0.2, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 °C per min, at pH 5.5 and 7.4, to analyze the kinetically controlled denaturation of I-Ek-Hb (Fig. 5). The thermodynamic parameters obtained from each transition curve are summarized in Table IV. Whereas theTd value at the rate of 0.2 °C per min was significantly lower than the others, those at the rate over 1 °C per min were similar at both pH values, indicating that the transition temperatures at high heating rates reach their maximum values with little effect from the irreversibility. All of the ΔHcal values obtained with the various heating rates were similar, within experimental error.Figure 5Variation with heating rate of I-Ek-Hb unfolding at pH 5.5 (A) and 7.4 (B).

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) proposed four methods to evaluate the activation energy from the excess heat capacity curves, using the scan rate dependence of irreversible denaturation. The graphical presentations of the evaluations according to methods A, B, and C, described under “Experimental Procedures,” are shown in Fig. 6, and the analyzed activation parameters, including method D, are summarized in TableV. Although the activation energies derived from the various methods differed, the average value was larger than the previously reported values for the denaturation of other proteins, which are in the range between 280 and 360 kJ mol−1 (24Vogl T. Jatzke C. Hinz H.J. Benz J. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The large activation energy suggests that most of the native structure of I-Ek-Hb should be denatured before the irreversible transition occurs, and the thermodynamic parameters for the denaturation of I-Ek-Hb could be analyzed as an equilibrium quantity, as described above. Similar to the activation energy, the T* values were almost independent of the scan rate, and were higher than the Td values, except for those from the scan rate of 2 °C per min (Tables IV andV). Together with the results of the scan rate experiments, this result supports the validity of the approximation to determine the equilibrium thermodynamics from DSC experiments with the scan rate of 1 °C per min.Table VActivation parameters for denaturation of I-Ek-Hb at pH 5.5 and 7.4pHHeating rateT*EaMethod AMethod BMethod CMethod D°C min−1°CkJ mol−15.50.277.04514914361.076.84374834761.577.74925004902.077.1535545489478 ± 44371 ± 23504 ± 27482 ± 547.40.266.13993683851.069.14304204011.568.74854303912.066.6395389375427 ± 41311 ± 81401 ± 28385 ± 10The protein concentration was in the range between 0.33 and 0.38 mg ml−1.

Irreversible thermal denaturation is observed in many proteins, including MHC molecules, which makes it difficult to analyze the precise thermodynamics. In the present study, we found the interesting phenomenon of MHC stability as a function of pH, although the thermal denaturation process was irreversible. The thermodynamic origin of the increased stability at the mildly acidic pH could be because of the dynamic properties of MHC molecules, which are important for the function of MHC class II molecules. To determine the thermodynamics and to evaluate their validity, the effects of the irreversibility should first be analyzed under various conditions. Because the method to extract thermodynamic equilibrium parameters from kinetically controlled heat capacity curves has been applied successfully to several systems (17Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Mateo P.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 24Vogl T. Jatzke C. Hinz H.J. Benz J. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Freire E. van Osdol W.W. Mayorga O.L. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 159-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), we used this method in the present study. The Td and ΔH values were almost independent at a protein concentration of around 0.3 mg ml−1 and a heating rate over of 1 °C per min (TablesIII and IV). Additionally, the large activation energy and the highT* value indicated that the thermal denaturation process under these conditions could be analyzed as the equilibrium thermodynamics, with little interference from the irreversible process (Table V). Therefore, the thermodynamic parameters as a function of pH (Table I), obtained with a heating rate of 1 °C per min and a protein concentration of about 0.3 mg ml−1 are meaningful. In the previous CD analyses of the thermal denaturation of MHC class II molecules, the temperature was increased in a stepwise mode (10Reich Z. Altman J.D. Boniface J.J. Lyons D.S. Kozono H. Ogg G. Morgan C. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2495-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Wilson N. Fremont D. Marrack P. Kappler J. Immunity. 2001; 14: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because it takes a few minutes at each temperature for equilibrium attainment and recording, the Td values should be lower than those obtained with the method of continuous heating used in this study. This is supported by the fact that the stability of I-Ek-Hb at pH 7.4 in the previous CD measurements was similar to that at the heating rate of 0.2 °C per min in this study (Table IV) (11Wilson N. Fremont D. Marrack P. Kappler J. Immunity. 2001; 14: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Under the conditions of a stepwise mode or a low heating rate for the analysis of irreversible denaturation, theTd value is largely dependent on the heating rate. In the thermal denaturation process of I-Ek-Hb, three transitions should be involved: 1) peptide dissociation from the MHC class II molecule, 2) dissociation of the αβ heterodimer to each subunit, and 3) denaturation of each subunit. The excess heat capacity curve of I-Ek-Hb should be the sum of these transitions. Although the ratio ΔHcal/ΔHvH under the various conditions of the DSC measurements is around 0.9 to 1.4 (TablesI, III, and IV), we cannot exclude the possibility of the existence of intermediate states and/or the coupling of respective transitions. Because the bound peptide contributes to the stability of MHC molecules (26Simon A. Dosztanyi Z. Rajnavolgyi E. Simon I. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2305-2313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the peptide dissociation should occur first, to cause the subsequent denaturation. This is also supported by the results that the thermal denaturation profiles of I-Ek in complex with mutant peptides of Hb seemed to be cooperative, similar to that of I-Ek-Hb, although their Td values differed from each other. 2K. Saito, A. Sarai, M. Oda, T. Azuma, and H. Kozono, unpublished results.These results indicate that the apparent stability of the MHC-peptide complex is largely dependent on the binding kinetics and/or the affinity of the bound peptide. The empty MHC class II molecule, I-Ek without the peptide, showed apparent size heterogeneity, including the αβ heterodimer and the high molecular weight aggregates, and the addition of peptide changed this heterogeneous molecule into the homogeneous αβ heterodimer (19Kozono H. White J. Clements J. Marrack P. Kappler J. Nature. 1994; 369: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar,27Stern L.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 68: 465-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), indicating that the irreversible transition is followed by the dissociation of each subunit and its denaturation. Increased stability at a mildly acidic pH relative to that at a neutral pH was also observed in a murine MHC class II molecule, I-Ab, in complex with CLIP and the antigenic peptide derived from the α subunit of the I-E molecule, Eα (28Tobita T. Oda M. Morii H. Kuroda M. Yoshino A. Azuma T. Kozono H. Immunol. Lett. 2003; 85: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, the thermal stabilities of I-Ad-Eα and I-Ek complexed with the moth cytochrome cpeptide at a mildly acidic pH are similar to those at neutral pH (10Reich Z. Altman J.D. Boniface J.J. Lyons D.S. Kozono H. Ogg G. Morgan C. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2495-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Despite the stability difference at both pH regions, all of the MHC class II molecules are resistant to a lower pH, that is in contrast to the stability of the MHC class I molecule (10Reich Z. Altman J.D. Boniface J.J. Lyons D.S. Kozono H. Ogg G. Morgan C. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2495-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The increased stability at a mildly acidic pH of the other MHC class II molecules may also be because of entropic effects, similar to I-Ek-Hb as described below, which generally correlates with their functions in an acidic compartment. In addition to the difference in the Td values, other thermodynamic parameters for denaturation at the mildly acidic pH differed from those at the neutral pH. The correlation ofTd with ΔHcal at various pH values indicated that the folding of I-Ek-Hb could be classified into two groups (Fig. 3), which is consistent with the difference observed in the structural analyses, as described below. The ΔCp values obtained from the slope ofTdversus ΔHcalin phosphate buffer were 11.1 kJ mol−1 K−1for the mildly acidic pH and 15.9 kJ mol−1K−1 for the neutral pH. To compare the obtained values with those of other proteins with a similar size, the empirical method proposed by Oobatake and Ooi (29Oobatake M. Ooi T. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 237-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) was applied and the ΔCp value of a 420-residue (NR) protein was calculated to be 30.2 kJ mol−1 K−1 from the following equation.ΔCp(cal mol−1K−1)=−512+18.39NREq. 10 This value, 30.2 kJ mol−1 K−1, is larger than the experimentally determined values of I-Ek-Hb at either pH region, indicating that the surface of non-polar residues of I-Ek-Hb is more accessible to the solvent than that of other proteins. Furthermore, it should be noted that the ΔCp value at the mildly acidic pH is lower than that at the neutral pH. This is consistent with the previous results, in which the acidification changed I-Ek into a more fluctuating state with an increase in the exposed hydrophobicity, like a molten globule state (12Boniface J.J. Lyons D.S. Wettstein D.A. Allbritton N.L. Davis M.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Runnels H.A. Moore J.C. Jensen P.E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The analyses of the protonation effects showed that the ΔHcal values in the buffer with a larger heat of ionization, MOPS, are smaller than those in the buffer with a lower heat of ionization, phosphate, whereas the thermal stability at an acidic pH is higher than that at a neutral pH in both buffers. The difference of the ΔHcal values should be because of the enthalpy of buffer ionization and the linked protonation effects (21Fukada H. Takahashi K. Proteins. 1998; 33: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 22Baker B.M. Murphy K.P. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2049-2055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Petrosian and Makhatadze (23Petrosian S.A. Makhatadze G.I. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) successfully evaluated the contribution of linked protonation effects on the stability of a 69-amino acid residue protein, with consideration of the isoelectric point (pI). In the case of a 420-residue protein, I-Ek-Hb, the pI value in the denatured state is estimated to be 4.8 from the amino acid composition, and that in the native state is estimated to be 5.0 by the isoelectric focusing experiments (data not shown). Amino acid residues such as Asp and His, with charges that are affected at the pH region analyzed in this study, are thought to be involved in the structural and functional characters of MHC class II molecules (16Kersh G.J. Miley M.J. Nelson C.A. Grakoui A. Horvath S. Donermeyer D.L. Kappler J. Allen P.M. Fremont D.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3345-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 30McFarland B.J. Katz J.F. Beeson C. Sant A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9231-9236Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Rötzschke O. Lau J.M. Hofstätter M. Falk K. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16946-16950Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, the present thermodynamic results obtained in phosphate buffer, which has lower enthalpy change for the deprotonation, could be the comparable data to analyze the effects of pH on the stability difference of I-Ek-Hb. Assuming the enthalpy derived from linked protonation effects is compensated by the large ionization enthalpy of MOPS buffer, as observed in the CspA unfolding (23Petrosian S.A. Makhatadze G.I. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the conformational enthalpy change can be estimated to be about 700 kJ/mol. Still on this assumption, the increased stability of I-Ek-Hb at acidic pH is because of a favorable ΔS, as described below. To analyze the thermodynamic origin of the stability difference, the thermodynamic parameters at 75.4 °C, the denaturation temperature at pH 5.5, were calculated using the correlation of ΔG and ΔH with temperature (TableVI). Within the narrow range of temperature around the Td values, the errors of the calculated ΔG and ΔH values at the reference temperature should be small, even if the ΔCpvalues used contain some errors, because of the temperature dependence and the linked protonation effects. This result clearly indicates that the higher stability at the mildly acidic pH than that at the neutral pH is because of the difference in the entropic contributions. One possible explanation for this entropic difference as a function of pH is that the native structure of I-Ek-Hb at the mildly acidic pH is more flexible, which can facilitate the peptide exchange. This is consistent with the previous SDS-PAGE and structural analyses, in which I-Ek gained flexibility at low pH (11Wilson N. Fremont D. Marrack P. Kappler J. Immunity. 2001; 14: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Sadegh-Nasseri S. Germain R.N. Nature. 1991; 353: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The smaller ΔCp value of I-Ek-Hb at low pH, as described above, should also be because of this increased flexibility. Although the difference in the secondary and tertiary structures between the mildly acidic and neutral pH values detected in the CD measurements is subtle (Fig. 1B), similar to the previous reports (12Boniface J.J. Lyons D.S. Wettstein D.A. Allbritton N.L. Davis M.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32Lee J.M. Kay C.M. Watts T.H. Int. Immunol. 1992; 4: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the molecule will be more dynamically fluctuating and the surface of non-polar residues will be more accessible to solvent at a mildly acidic pH.Table VIThermodynamic parameters for denaturation of I-Ek-Hb in phosphate buffer at the denaturation temperature at pH 5.5pHTd6-aTd values were taken from Table I.ΔTdΔHTΔS6-bTΔS values were calculated from the equation, ΔG(T) = ΔH(T) −TΔS(T).ΔG°CkJ mol−15.575.472372307.467.2−8.2874885−116-a Td values were taken from Table I.6-b TΔS values were calculated from the equation, ΔG(T) = ΔH(T) −TΔS(T). Open table in a new tab The kinetic and structural analyses of I-Ek-Hb have shown that the hydrogen bonding network, formed by the cluster of carboxylate groups around the P6 pocket, Asp66 and Glu11 of the α subunit, Asp73 of the Hb peptide, and water molecules, changes as a function of pH, which can regulate the conformation of I-Ek and the peptide exchange rate (11Wilson N. Fremont D. Marrack P. Kappler J. Immunity. 2001; 14: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The protonation of these carboxylate groups at low pH, together with other residues such as His81 of the β subunit, facilitates the flexibility and the conformational change of the MHC class II molecule from the closed to the open form (30McFarland B.J. Katz J.F. Beeson C. Sant A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9231-9236Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, the recent mutational analyses of HLA-DR, the human homologue of I-Ek, have shown that His33 of the α subunit has the role of a pH-sensitive switch at low pH, which can regulate the conformational transition and the peptide exchange (31Rötzschke O. Lau J.M. Hofstätter M. Falk K. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16946-16950Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The decreased ΔH, TΔS, and ΔCp values for the thermal denaturation of I-Ek-Hb at the mildly acidic pH relative to those at the neutral pH should be because of the differences in the dynamic properties, which are closely related with the function of MHC class II molecules. The present DSC analyses provide thermodynamic insight into the increased stability at the acidic pH.
