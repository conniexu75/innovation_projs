https://openalex.org/W1995188323,"Volcanic glass in marine sediments off Oregon and Washington correlates with continental deposits of Mount Mazama ash by stratigraphic position, refractive index, and radiocarbon dating. Ash deposited in the abyssal regions by turbidity currents is used for tracing of the dispersal routes of postglacial sediments and for evaluation of marine sedimentary processes."

For natural olivines, in which divalent cations, mainly Fe(2+), can replace Mg(2+), all the optical absorption bands between the lattice overtones in the infrared and the first excitonic transition at 8.4 electron volts are due to the presence of iron."

https://openalex.org/W1974805252,"Spectroscopic observations of the two stars near the pulsar CP 1919+21 are not sufficiently conclusive to permit an identification of either object with the source of the radio pulses. However, our most extensive series of photometric observations of a region of sky near the radio source position, which region includes the brighter of the two stars, suggests an approximately sinusoidal variation. It is significant that the period of the variation is double the period of the radio pulsations."

https://openalex.org/W1572017501,"THE ninth annual report of the president and the treasurer of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, for the year ending September 30, 1914, shows a total endowment of 2,850,000l., a surplus of 249,000l., an annual income of 149,200l., and an annual expenditure of 143,200l. Of this 9400l. was spent in administration, 9400l. in educational inquiry, and 126,800l. in retiring allowances and pensions. During the year twenty-nine retiring allowances and fifteen widows pensions were granted, the average grant being 329l. 10s., The total number of allowances now in force is 332, the total number of widows' pensions 100, the general average grant being 319l. The total number of allowances granted since the beginning of the foundation is 595, the total expenditure for this purpose being 710,200l."
https://openalex.org/W2003559918,"Submarine slopes in deep water, such as continental slopes, are often indented by valleys or channels and made uneven by ridges or levees. The origins of many of these features are unknown or disputed. Morphologically, however, there is often great similarity between forms on deep slopes and forms on shallow slopes or on land. Structurally the slopes in deep water are less well explored, but several observations reveal features, such as lamination and crossbedding, that are known from shallow water also. Measurements of current indicate that periodically the movement of water near the bottom is fast enough to move particles of sediment from time to time. Morphology, fine structure, and currents suggest that internal waves and associated currents, as well as gravity, may control the shape of deep submarine slopes analogously to the shaping by surface waves of slopes in shallow water."
