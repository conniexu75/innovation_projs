https://openalex.org/W55241168,"In the Rh system of blood groups two forms of antibody have been described, an agglutinin and an ‘incomplete’, ‘blocking’ or ‘conglutinating’ antibody1,2. The iso-agglutinin can be detected by the ordinary iso-agglutinin technique3, which, however, fails to detect the incomplete antibody. The presence of the latter in a serum can, however, be demonstrated by the blocking test1, the Coombs test4, the Diamond slide test5, the conglutination test6, and the albumen test7."

https://openalex.org/W1978748391,"IT was suggested in a recent communication1 that kineses be designated as positive and negative, as is done with taxes. The arguments advanced against the use of 'high' and 'low' for kineses still stand, but after discussions with other workers and some experience of applying positive and negative to specific cases of kineses, these terms do not appear satisfactory. For the sake of clarity it seems desirable to apply to kineses terms different from those applied to taxes."

https://openalex.org/W1994092900,IN a previous note1 it has been reported that 2-chloro-5-amino-7-hydroxyacridine is to be found in the urines of mepacrine-taking subjects. We have now subjected such urines to a separation technique based on that applied by Scudi and Jellinek2 to the urines of dogs.
https://openalex.org/W2071327407,"IT has been shown previously that in the flour moth, Ephestia Kuhniella, the gene a in homozygous condition causes lack of kyrurenin and consequently a deficiency in the eye pigments depending on the presence of kyrurenin1. Since kyrurenin is derived from tryptophane by oxidation, it is assumed that the oxidation of tryptophane to kyrurenin is inhibited in aa animals. This is confirmed by the fact that an increased amount of tryptophane is found in the proteins of aa animals2,3."

https://openalex.org/W2056023156,"DURING some work in this Research Department on compounds of uranium, as a safety precaution, we commenced to analyse the urine of personnel concerned, using a fluorimetric method. In the preparation of fluorimetric standards, known amounts of uranyl nitrate were added to samples of urine from persons not engaged on the work with uranium. To our surprise we found uranium to be present in some of the 'blank' urine samples. It was found that analysts who had recently been engaged in the determination of sodium as sodium uranyl magnesium acetate1 voided traces of uranium in their urine, the element being detected for some weeks after the analyst ceased to be using ‘sodium reagent’. Out of 14 analysts examined between January 28, 1944 and February 1, 1944, six (Nos. 1–6 below) who had been in contact with magnesium uranyl acetate solution during the past two months had urine containing 2–10 Âµgm. per litre of uranium, eight (Nos. 7–14) who had not been in such recent contact with uranium salts varied from ‘not detected’ to 4 Âµgm. per litre. The table gives the experimental figures, expressed as μgm. uranium per litre. The fluorescence was compared visually, against standards equivalent to 2.6 or 10 Âµgm. per litre, 2 Âµgm. per litre being the limit of detection by the method used."
https://openalex.org/W1990511764,"THE widespread use of the two new insecticides D.D.T. and ‘Gammexane’ (gamma isomer of benzene hexachloride) has led to considerable interest being taken in their possible toxic effect upon man and animals. In the case of D.D.T., a considerable literature is already available on this aspect, and both acute and chronic toxicity has been discussed by various authors. With regard to ‘Gammexane’, Cameron1 has given some notes on its acute toxicity, and Slade2 has reported the toxicity of the four benzene hexachloride isomers to rats, but little or no information is available as to the possibility either of chronic poisoning or of a cumulative effect."
https://openalex.org/W1969231026,"IN his book ""Essays on the Floating-Matter of the Air"" (1881), the physicist John Tyndall describes experiments which he carried out in 1875 refuting the doctrine of spontaneous generation of life. In the course of these experiments tubes of organic infusions were infected with organisms after exposure to the atmosphere. A number of cases occurred when such tubes, which were turbid and swarming with bacteria, became covered with Penicillium glaucum, three unspecified kinds being noticed. The bacteria in these tubes lost their translatory power and fell to the bottom, leaving the liquid between them and the superficial layer clear. Tyndall ascribes this to the success of the moulds in the struggle for existence and notes that access of oxygen to the body of fluid must have been hindered. He did not, however, test the clear liquid for its capacity to support newly implanted bacterial life. It is interesting to speculate upon what the consequences might have been had Tyndall allowed himself to be drawn from his main investigation."

But the thing has recurred to my mind, and I am encouraged to think there may be something in it after all."
