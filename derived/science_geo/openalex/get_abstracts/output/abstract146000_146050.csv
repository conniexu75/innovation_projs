https://openalex.org/W1645530958,"We have demonstrated a disposable microfabricated fluorescence-activated cell sorter (microFACS) for sorting various biological entities. Compared with conventional FACS machines, the microFACS provides higher sensitivity, no cross-contamination, and lower cost. We have used microFACS chips to obtain substantial enrichment of micron-sized fluorescent bead populations of differing colors. Furthermore, we have separated Escherichia coli cells expressing green fluorescent protein from a background of nonfluorescent E. coli cells and shown that the bacteria are viable after extraction from the sorting device. These sorters can function as stand-alone devices or as components of an integrated microanalytical chip."

https://openalex.org/W1952459948,"We have previously shown that the small heat shock protein HSP27 inhibited apoptotic pathways triggered by a variety of stimuli in mammalian cells. The present study demonstrates that HSP27 overexpression decreases U937 human leukemic cell sensitivity to etoposide-induced cytotoxicity by preventing apoptosis. As observed for Bcl-2, HSP27 overexpression delays poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase cleavage and procaspase-3 activation. In contrast with Bcl-2, HSP27 overexpression does not prevent etoposide-induced cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. In a cell-free system, addition of cytochrome c and dATP to cytosolic extracts from untreated cells induces the proteolytic activation of procaspase-3 in both control and bcl-2-transfected U937 cells but fails to activate procaspase-3 in HSP27-overexpressing cells. Immunodepletion of HSP27 from cytosolic extracts increases cytochrome c/dATP-mediated activation of procaspase-3. Overexpression of HSP27 also prevents procaspase-9 activation. In the cell-free system, immunodepletion of HSP27 increases LEDH-AFC peptide cleavage activity triggered by cytochrome c/dATP treatment. We conclude that HSP27 inhibits etoposide-induced apoptosis by preventing cytochrome c and dATP-triggered activity of caspase-9, downstream of cytochrome c release."
https://openalex.org/W2106979999,"A number of biochemical defects have been identified in glucose metabolism within skeletal muscle in obesity, and positive effects of weight loss on insulin resistance are also well established. Less is known about the capacity of skeletal muscle for the metabolism of fatty acids in obesity-related insulin resistance and of the effects of weight loss, though it is evident that muscle contains increased triglyceride. The current study was therefore undertaken to profile markers of human skeletal muscle for fatty acid metabolism in relation to obesity, in relation to the phenotype of insulin-resistant glucose metabolism, and to examine the effects of weight loss. Fifty-five men and women, lean and obese, with normal glucose tolerance underwent percutaneous biopsy of vastus lateralis skeletal muscle for determination of HADH, CPT, heparin-releasable (Hr) and tissue-extractable (Ext) LPL, CS, COX, PFK, and GAPDH enzyme activities, and content of cytosolic and plasma membrane FABP. Insulin sensitivity was measured using the euglycemic clamp method. DEXA was used to measure FM and FFM. In skeletal muscle of obese individuals, CPT, CS, and COX activities were lower while, conversely, they had a higher or similar content of FABP(C) and FABP(PM) than in lean individuals. Hr and Ext LPL activities were similar in both groups. In multivariate and simple regression analyses, there were significant correlations between insulin resistance and several markers of FA metabolism, notably, CPT and FABP(PM). These data suggest that in obesity-related insulin resistance, the metabolic capacity of skeletal muscle appears to be organized toward fat esterification rather than oxidation and that dietary-induced weight loss does not correct this disposition."

https://openalex.org/W1931051077,"Longitudinal bone growth, and hence stature, are functions of growth plate chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) is reputed to augment longitudinal bone growth by stimulating growth plate chondrocyte proliferation. In this study, however, we demonstrate that chondrocyte numbers and proliferation are normal in Igf1 null mice despite a 35% reduction in the rate of long bone growth. Igf1 null hypertrophic chondrocytes differentiate normally in terms of expressing specialized proteins such as collagen X and alkaline phosphatase, but are smaller than wild-type at all levels of the hypertrophic zone. The terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes, which form the scaffold on which long bone growth extends, are reduced in linear dimension by 30% in Igf1 null mice, accounting for most of their decreased longitudinal growth. The expression of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, GLUT4, is significantly decreased and the insulin-regulated enzyme glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3) is hypo-phosphorylated in Igf1 null chondrocytes. Glycogen levels were significantly decreased and ribosomal RNA levels were reduced by almost 75% in Igf1 null chondrocytes. These data suggest that Igf1 promotes longitudinal bone growth by 'insulin-like' anabolic actions which augment chondrocyte hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W1934754959,"Recently, we demonstrated a large induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) during cutaneous wound repair. In this study, we investigated the role of nitric oxide (NO) for the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which represents the most important angiogenic factor during the proliferative phase of skin repair. Since keratinocytes are the major source of VEGF production during this process, we used cultured keratinocytes (HaCaT cell line) as an in vitro model to investigate NO action on growth factor- and cytokine-stimulated VEGF expression. Exogenously added NO enhanced transforming growth factor-beta1-, keratinocyte growth factor-, interleukin-1beta-, tumor necrosis factor-alpha-, and interferon-gamma-induced VEGF mRNA and protein synthesis in keratinocytes. We could demonstrate that high-level expression of cytokine-induced VEGF mRNA in keratinocytes is dependent on endogenously produced NO, as inhibition of the coinduced iNOS by N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) markedly decreased cytokine-triggered VEGF mRNA levels in the cells. We also established an in vivo model in mice to investigate the role of NO during wound healing. During excisional wound repair, mice were treated with L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)lysine (L-NIL), a selective inhibitor of iNOS enzymatic activity. Compared to control mice, L-NIL-treated animals were characterized by markedly reduced VEGF mRNA levels during the inflammatory phase of repair. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated reduced VEGF protein expression and a completely disorganized pattern of VEGF-expressing keratinocytes within the hyperproliferative epithelium at the wound edge in L-NIL-treated mice. We demonstrate that triggering of VEGF expression is a crucial molecular mechanism underlying NO function during wound healing."

https://openalex.org/W1869407264,"We demonstrate here that the release of mature cytochrome c from mitochondria is a cellular response to the depletion of glutathione, the main intracellular antioxidant, independently from the destiny of the cells, i.e., apoptosis or survival. On the one hand, cytosolic cytochrome c was detected in cells where the inhibition of glutathione synthesis led to glutathione depletion without impairing viability or in tight concomitance with glutathione depletion prior to puromycin-induced apoptosis. Removal of the apoptogenic agent prior to apoptosis, but after glutathione extrusion and cytochrome c release, led to recovery of preapoptotic cells, which resume healthy features, i.e., restoration of normal glutathione levels and disappearance of cytosolic cytochrome c. On the other hand, in an example of apoptosis occurring without glutathione depletion, no translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol was detected. Unlike the other instances of apoptosis, in this case caspase 3 was not activated, thus suggesting the following oxidant-related apoptotic pathway: glutathione depletion, cytochrome c release, and caspase 3 activation. These results show that cytochrome c release is not a terminal event leading cells to apoptosis, but rather is the consequence of a redox disequilibrium that, under some circumstances, may be associated with apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1866128922,"The histone deacetylase inhibitor and potential anti-cancer drug sodium butyrate is a general inducer of growth arrest, differentiation, and in certain cell types, apoptosis. In human CCRF-CEM, acute T lymphoblastic leukemia cells, butyrate, and other histone deacetylase inhibitors caused G2/M cell cycle arrest as well as apoptotic cell death. Forced G0/G1 arrest by tetracycline-regulated expression of transgenic p16/INK4A protected the cells from butyrate-induced cell death without affecting the extent of histone hyperacetylation, suggesting that the latter may be necessary, but not sufficient, for cell death induction. Nuclear apoptosis, but not G2/M arrest, was delayed but not prevented by the tripeptide broad-range caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp.fluoromethylketone (zVAD) and, to a lesser extent, by the tetrapeptide 'effector caspase' inhibitors benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp.fluoromethylketone (DEVD) and benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Glu-Ile-Asp.fluoromethyl-ketone (VEID); however, the viral protein inhibitor of 'inducer caspases', crmA, had no effect. Bcl-2 overexpression partially protected stably transfected CCRF-CEM sublines from butyrate-induced apoptosis, but showed no effect on butyrate-induced growth inhibition, further distinguishing these two butyrate effects. c-myc, constitutively expressed in CCRF-CEM cells, was down-regulated by butyrate, but this was not causative for cell death. On the contrary, tetracycline-induced transgenic c-myc sensitized stably transfected CCRF-CEM derivatives to butyrate-induced cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1775644376,"Studies of T lymphocyte activation with mitogenic lectins during spaceflight have shown a dramatic inhibition of activation as measured by DNA synthesis at 72 h, but the mechanism of this inhibition is unknown. We have investigated the progression of cellular events during the first 24 h of activation using both spaceflight microgravity culture and a ground-based model system that relies on the low shear culture environment of a rotating clinostat (clinorotation). Stimulation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with soluble anti-CD3 (Leu4) in clinorotation and in microgravity culture shows a dramatic reduction in surface expression of the receptor for IL-2 (CD25) and CD69. An absence of bulk RNA synthesis in clinorotation indicates that stimulation with soluble Leu4 does not induce transition of T cells from G0 to the G1 stage of the cell cycle. However, internalization of the TCR by T cells and normal levels of IL-1 synthesis by monocytes indicate that intercellular interactions that are required for activation occur during clinorotation. Complementation of TCR-mediated signaling by phorbol ester restores the ability of PBMCs to express CD25 in clinorotation, indicating that a PKC-associated pathway may be compromised under these conditions. Bypassing the TCR by direct activation of intracellular pathways with a combination of phorbol ester and calcium ionophore in clinorotation resulted in full expression of CD25; however, only partial expression of CD25 occurred in microgravity culture. Though stimulation of purified T cells with Bead-Leu4 in microgravity culture resulted in the engagement and internalization of the TCR, the cells still failed to express CD25. When T cells were stimulated with Bead-Leu4 in microgravity culture, they were able to partially express CD69, a receptor that is constitutively stored in intracellular pools and can be expressed in the absence of new gene expression. Our results suggest that the inhibition of T cell proliferative response in microgravity culture is a result of alterations in signaling events within the first few hours of activation, which are required for the expression of important regulatory molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2120972285,"We have recently demonstrated that the myelinolytic lesions in the spinal cord (SC) of rats made deficient in vitamin B(12) (cobalamin) (Cbl) through total gastrectomy (TG) are tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-mediated. We investigate whether or not permanent Cbl deficiency, induced in the rat either through TG or by chronic feeding of a Cbl-deficient diet, might modify the levels of three physiological neurotrophic factors-epidermal growth factor (EGF), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and somatostatin (SS)-in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of these rats. We also investigated the ability of the central nervous system (CNS) in these Cbl-deficient rats to synthesize EGF mRNA and of the SC to take up labeled Cbl in vivo. Cbl-deficient rats, however the vitamin deficiency is induced, show a selective decrease in EGF CSF levels and an absence of EGF mRNA in neurons and glia in various CNS areas. In contrast, radiolabeled Cbl is almost exclusively taken up by the SC white matter, but to a much higher degree in totally gastrectomized (TGX) rats. Chronic administration of Cbl to TGX rats restores to normal both the EGF CSF level and EGF mRNA expression in the various CNS areas examined. This in vivo study presents the first evidence that the neurotrophic action of Cbl in the CNS of TGX rats is mediated by stimulation of the EGF synthesis in the CNS itself. It thus appears that Cbl inversely regulates the expression of EGF and TNF-alpha genes in the CNS of TGX rats."
https://openalex.org/W1758790905,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent antigen presenting cells reported to undergo irreversible functional 'maturation' in response to inflammatory signals such as TNF-alpha. The current paradigm holds that this DC maturation event is required for full functional capacity and represents terminal differentiation of this cell type, culminating in apoptotic cell death. This provides a possible mechanism for avoiding dysregulated immunostimulatory activity, but imposes constraints on the capacity of DCs to influence subsequent immune responses and to participate in immunological memory. We report that the cell surface and functional effects induced by TNF-alpha are reversible and reinducible. These effects are accompanied by a concordant modulation of cytokine mRNA expression that includes the induction of proinflammatory factors (IL-15, IL-12, LT-alpha, LT-beta, TNF-alpha, RANTES) which is coincident with the down-regulation of counter-regulatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, IL-1 RA, MCP-1). The resultant net effect is a dendritic cell activation state characterized by a transient proinflammatory posture. These results demonstrate that 1) human DCs do not undergo terminal 'maturation' in response to TNF-alpha, 2) DC phenotypes are more pleiotropic than previously thought, and 3) DCs are potential immunoregulatory effector cells with implications for control of immune responses in both in vivo and in vitro systems."

https://openalex.org/W1783320728,"In CHO cells we had found that CCK positively regulated cell proliferation via the activation of a soluble guanylate cyclase. Here we demonstrate that CCK stimulated a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. The production of NO was involved in the proliferative response elicited by CCK regarding the inhibitory effect of NOS inhibitors L-NAME and alpha-guanidinoglutaric acid. We identified the NOS activated by the peptide as the neuronal isoform: the expression of the C415A neuronal NOS mutant inhibited both CCK-induced stimulation of NOS activity and cell proliferation. These two effects were also inhibited after expression of the C459S tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 mutant and the betaARK1 (495-689) sequestrant peptide, indicating the requirement of activated SHP-2 and G-betagamma subunit. Kinetic analysis (Western blot after coimmunoprecipitation and specific SHP-2 activity) revealed that in response to CCK-treatment, SHP-2 associated to G-beta1 subunit, became activated, and then dephosphorylated the neuronal NOS through a direct association. These data demonstrate that the neuronal NOS is implicated in proliferative effect evoked by CCK. A novel growth signaling pathway is described, involving the activation of neuronal NOS by dephosphorylation of tyrosyl residues."
https://openalex.org/W1488917316,"Patients in the chronic phase of Chagas' disease suffer from a slowly evolving inflammatory cardiomyopathy that can lead to severe cardiac dilatation, congestive heart failure, and death. This process appears to be caused by autoimmune recognition of heart tissue by a mononuclear cell infiltrate decades after infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Recent evidence suggests that there are circulating antibodies in chronic chagasic patients that alter the physiological behavior of the heart on binding to G-protein-coupled cardiovascular receptors, including beta1-adrenergic and m2 muscarinic receptors. A 42 kDa fusion protein was constructed that contains the central part of the third intracellular loop (i3; Arg(267)-Arg(381)) of the human m2 muscarinic receptor, linked to glutathione S-transferase. This fusion protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and subsequently purified by affinity chromatography. Based on Western blots, the i3 loop is specifically recognized by the sera of chronic chagasic patients who have reached advanced stages of cardiac failure (according to the Los Andes classification). Analysis of the prevalence and distribution of these antibodies shows a strong association between seropositive patients and moderate (group II) to severe (group III) heart dysfunction."

https://openalex.org/W1859951759,"It was investigated whether up-regulation of the NPY gene by the schistosome Trichobilharzia ocellata in its snail host Lymnaea stagnalis redirects the host's energy flows. We cloned the cDNA encoding Lymnaea NPY (LyNPY), purified and sequenced the peptide, and used synthesized peptide for physiological and morphological studies. Increasing the LyNPY titer in nonparasitized snails (mimicking parasitosis) by 1) implantation of slow-release pellets and 2) injections suppressed reproductive activity and reduced growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner without affecting food intake. When the LyNPY titer was back to normal, reproduction and growth were resumed, coinciding with a transient increase of food intake serving to replenish glycogen stores. Observations on double-immunostained whole mount preparations of brains support these data. A close association was found between LyNPY-positive axons and axons both from ovulation hormone-producing neurons and molluscan insulin-like peptide-producing neurons involved in regulation of growth. As no synaptic(-like) contacts were observed, it is supposed that LyNPY acts nonsynaptically. No morphological interaction was found between LyNPY-positive axons and motoneurons innervating the feeding apparatus. Our data explain why it is an advantageous strategy for endoparasites to up-regulate the highly conserved NPY gene in their host."
