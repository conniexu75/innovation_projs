https://openalex.org/W2998401461,"Intraoperative diagnosis is essential for providing safe and effective care during cancer surgery1. The existing workflow for intraoperative diagnosis based on hematoxylin and eosin staining of processed tissue is time, resource and labor intensive2,3. Moreover, interpretation of intraoperative histologic images is dependent on a contracting, unevenly distributed, pathology workforce4. In the present study, we report a parallel workflow that combines stimulated Raman histology (SRH)5–7, a label-free optical imaging method and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict diagnosis at the bedside in near real-time in an automated fashion. Specifically, our CNNs, trained on over 2.5 million SRH images, predict brain tumor diagnosis in the operating room in under 150 s, an order of magnitude faster than conventional techniques (for example, 20–30 min)2. In a multicenter, prospective clinical trial (n = 278), we demonstrated that CNN-based diagnosis of SRH images was noninferior to pathologist-based interpretation of conventional histologic images (overall accuracy, 94.6% versus 93.9%). Our CNNs learned a hierarchy of recognizable histologic feature representations to classify the major histopathologic classes of brain tumors. In addition, we implemented a semantic segmentation method to identify tumor-infiltrated diagnostic regions within SRH images. These results demonstrate how intraoperative cancer diagnosis can be streamlined, creating a complementary pathway for tissue diagnosis that is independent of a traditional pathology laboratory. A prospective, multicenter, case–control clinical trial evaluates the potential of artificial intelligence for providing accurate bedside diagnosis of patients with brain tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2997632089,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief, bright, extragalactic radio flashes. Their physical origin remains unknown, but dozens of possible models have been postulated. Some FRB sources exhibit repeat bursts. Though over a hundred FRB sources have been discovered to date, only four have been localised and associated with a host galaxy, with just one of the four known to repeat. The properties of the host galaxies, and the local environments of FRBs, provide important clues about their physical origins. However, the first known repeating FRB has been localised to a low-metallicity, irregular dwarf galaxy, and the apparently non-repeating sources to higher-metallicity, massive elliptical or star-forming galaxies, suggesting that perhaps the repeating and apparently non-repeating sources could have distinct physical origins. Here we report the precise localisation of a second repeating FRB source, FRB 180916.J0158+65, to a star-forming region in a nearby (redshift $z = 0.0337 \pm 0.0002$) massive spiral galaxy, whose properties and proximity distinguish it from all known hosts. The lack of both a comparably luminous persistent radio counterpart and a high Faraday rotation measure further distinguish the local environment of FRB 180916.J0158+65 from that of the one previously localised repeating FRB source, FRB 121102. This demonstrates that repeating FRBs have a wide range of luminosities, and originate from diverse host galaxies and local environments."
https://openalex.org/W2997421847,"Animals readily execute learned behaviors in a consistent manner over long periods of time, and yet no equally stable neural correlate has been demonstrated. How does the cortex achieve this stable control? Using the sensorimotor system as a model of cortical processing, we investigated the hypothesis that the dynamics of neural latent activity, which captures the dominant co-variation patterns within the neural population, must be preserved across time. We recorded from populations of neurons in premotor, primary motor and somatosensory cortices as monkeys performed a reaching task, for up to 2 years. Intriguingly, despite a steady turnover in the recorded neurons, the low-dimensional latent dynamics remained stable. The stability allowed reliable decoding of behavioral features for the entire timespan, while fixed decoders based directly on the recorded neural activity degraded substantially. We posit that stable latent cortical dynamics within the manifold are the fundamental building blocks underlying consistent behavioral execution. Gallego, Perich et al. report that latent dynamics in the neural manifold across three cortical areas are stable throughout years of consistent behavior. The authors posit that these dynamics are fundamental building blocks of learned behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2997426704,"The intestinal microbiota is a complex community of bacteria, archaea, viruses, protists and fungi1,2. Although the composition of bacterial constituents has been linked to immune homeostasis and infectious susceptibility3-7, the role of non-bacterial constituents and cross-kingdom microbial interactions in these processes is poorly understood2,8. Fungi represent a major cause of infectious morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals, although the relationship of intestinal fungi (that is, the mycobiota) with fungal bloodstream infections remains undefined9. We integrated an optimized bioinformatics pipeline with high-resolution mycobiota sequencing and comparative genomic analyses of fecal and blood specimens from recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. Patients with Candida bloodstream infection experienced a prior marked intestinal expansion of pathogenic Candida species; this expansion consisted of a complex dynamic between multiple species and subspecies with a stochastic translocation pattern into the bloodstream. The intestinal expansion of pathogenic Candida spp. was associated with a substantial loss in bacterial burden and diversity, particularly in the anaerobes. Thus, simultaneous analysis of intestinal fungi and bacteria identifies dysbiosis states across kingdoms that may promote fungal translocation and facilitate invasive disease. These findings support microbiota-driven approaches to identify patients at risk of fungal bloodstream infections for pre-emptive therapeutic intervention."

https://openalex.org/W2997202359,"Collagen is the most abundant secreted protein in vertebrates and persists throughout life without renewal. The permanency of collagen networks contrasts with both the continued synthesis of collagen throughout adulthood and the conventional transcriptional/translational homeostatic mechanisms that replace damaged proteins with new copies. Here, we show circadian clock regulation of endoplasmic reticulum-to-plasma membrane procollagen transport by the sequential rhythmic expression of SEC61, TANGO1, PDE4D and VPS33B. The result is nocturnal procollagen synthesis and daytime collagen fibril assembly in mice. Rhythmic collagen degradation by CTSK maintains collagen homeostasis. This circadian cycle of collagen synthesis and degradation affects a pool of newly synthesized collagen, while maintaining the persistent collagen network. Disabling the circadian clock causes abnormal collagen fibrils and collagen accumulation, which are reduced in vitro by the NR1D1 and CRY1/2 agonists SR9009 and KL001, respectively. In conclusion, our study has identified a circadian clock mechanism of protein homeostasis wherein a sacrificial pool of collagen maintains tissue function. Here, Chang et al. show that the circadian clock regulates secretion resulting in nocturnal procollagen synthesis and daytime collagen fibril assembly in mice to maintain the homeostasis of the collagen network."
https://openalex.org/W2997454792,"Abstract Snakebite envenoming is a serious and neglected tropical disease that kills ~100,000 people annually. High-quality, genome-enabled comprehensive characterization of toxin genes will facilitate development of effective humanized recombinant antivenom. We report a de novo near-chromosomal genome assembly of Naja naja , the Indian cobra, a highly venomous, medically important snake. Our assembly has a scaffold N50 of 223.35 Mb, with 19 scaffolds containing 95% of the genome. Of the 23,248 predicted protein-coding genes, 12,346 venom-gland-expressed genes constitute the ‘venom-ome’ and this included 139 genes from 33 toxin families. Among the 139 toxin genes were 19 ‘venom-ome-specific toxins’ (VSTs) that showed venom-gland-specific expression, and these probably encode the minimal core venom effector proteins. Synthetic venom reconstituted through recombinant VST expression will aid in the rapid development of safe and effective synthetic antivenom. Additionally, our genome could serve as a reference for snake genomes, support evolutionary studies and enable venom-driven drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2996854824,"Temporal lobe epilepsy causes severe cognitive deficits, but the circuit mechanisms remain unknown. Interneuron death and reorganization during epileptogenesis may disrupt the synchrony of hippocampal inhibition. To test this, we simultaneously recorded from the CA1 and dentate gyrus in pilocarpine-treated epileptic mice with silicon probes during head-fixed virtual navigation. We found desynchronized interneuron firing between the CA1 and dentate gyrus in epileptic mice. Since hippocampal interneurons control information processing, we tested whether CA1 spatial coding was altered in this desynchronized circuit, using a novel wire-free miniscope. We found that CA1 place cells in epileptic mice were unstable and completely remapped across a week. This spatial instability emerged around 6 weeks after status epilepticus, well after the onset of chronic seizures and interneuron death. Finally, CA1 network modeling showed that desynchronized inputs can impair the precision and stability of CA1 place cells. Together, these results demonstrate that temporally precise intrahippocampal communication is critical for spatial processing."
https://openalex.org/W2996843935,"Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage that degrade bone. Here, we used lineage tracing studies—labelling cells expressing Cx3cr1, Csf1r or Flt3—to identify the precursors of osteoclasts in mice. We identified an erythromyeloid progenitor (EMP)-derived osteoclast precursor population. Yolk-sac macrophages of EMP origin produced neonatal osteoclasts that can create a space for postnatal bone marrow haematopoiesis. Furthermore, EMPs gave rise to long-lasting osteoclast precursors that contributed to postnatal bone remodelling in both physiological and pathological settings. Our single-cell RNA-sequencing data showed that EMP-derived osteoclast precursors arose independently of the haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) lineage and the data from fate tracking of EMP and HSC lineages indicated the possibility of cell–cell fusion between these two lineages. Cx3cr1+ yolk-sac macrophage descendants resided in the adult spleen, and parabiosis experiments showed that these cells migrated through the bloodstream to the remodelled bone after injury. Yahara et al. show that yolk-sac macrophages, which are derived from erythromyeloid progenitors, produce neonatal osteoclasts that support bone homeostasis and repair and also provide long-lasting osteoclasts in adult bone."
https://openalex.org/W2997545733,"Loss-of-function genetic variants of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) are linked with an enhanced risk of developing dementias. Microglia, the resident immune cell of the brain, express TREM2, and microglial responses are implicated in dementia pathways. In a normal surveillance state, microglia use oxidative phosphorylation for their energy supply, but rely on the ability to undergo a metabolic switch to glycolysis to allow them to perform rapid plastic responses. We investigated the role of TREM2 on the microglial metabolic function in human patient iPSC-derived microglia expressing loss of function variants in TREM2. We show that these TREM2 variant iPSC-microglia, including the Alzheimer's disease R47H risk variant, exhibit significant metabolic deficits including a reduced mitochondrial respiratory capacity and an inability to perform a glycolytic immunometabolic switch. We determined that dysregulated PPARγ/p38MAPK signaling underlies the observed phenotypic deficits in TREM2 variants and that activation of these pathways can ameliorate the metabolic deficit in these cells and consequently rescue critical microglial cellular function such as β-Amyloid phagocytosis. These findings have ramifications for microglial focussed-treatments in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2997878069,"Diffuse brain infiltration by glioma cells causes detrimental disease progression, but its multicellular coordination is poorly understood. We show here that glioma cells infiltrate the brain collectively as multicellular networks. Contacts between moving glioma cells are adaptive epithelial-like or filamentous junctions stabilized by N-cadherin, β-catenin and p120-catenin, which undergo kinetic turnover, transmit intercellular calcium transients and mediate directional persistence. Downregulation of p120-catenin compromises cell-cell interaction and communication, disrupts collective networks, and both the cadherin and RhoA binding domains of p120-catenin are required for network formation and migration. Deregulating p120-catenin further prevents diffuse glioma cell infiltration of the mouse brain with marginalized microlesions as the outcome. Transcriptomics analysis has identified p120-catenin as an upstream regulator of neurogenesis and cell cycle pathways and a predictor of poor clinical outcome in glioma patients. Collective glioma networks infiltrating the brain thus depend on adherens junctions dynamics, the targeting of which may offer an unanticipated strategy to halt glioma progression."
https://openalex.org/W2997046348,"The poor outcomes in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) prompted us to interrogate the pattern and timing of metastatic spread. Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 388 samples across 18 individuals with EAC showed, in 90% of patients, that multiple subclones from the primary tumor spread very rapidly from the primary site to form multiple metastases, including lymph nodes and distant tissues-a mode of dissemination that we term 'clonal diaspora'. Metastatic subclones at autopsy were present in tissue and blood samples from earlier time points. These findings have implications for our understanding and clinical evaluation of EAC."
https://openalex.org/W2997934774,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) is an enigmatic protein with various roles in healthy tissue homeostasis/development as well as the development or progression of cancer, wound healing, fibrotic disorders, and immune modulation, to name a few. As TGFβ is causal to various fibroproliferative disorders featuring localized or systemic tissue/organ fibrosis as well as the activated stroma observed in various malignancies, characterizing the pathways and players mediating its action is fundamental. In the current study, we found that TGFβ induces the expression of the immunoinhibitory molecule Programed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in human and murine fibroblasts in a Smad2/3- and YAP/TAZ-dependent manner. Furthermore, PD-L1 knockdown decreased the TGFβ-dependent induction of extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen Iα1 (colIα1) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and cell migration/wound healing. In addition to an endogenous role for PD-L1 in profibrotic TGFβ signaling, TGFβ stimulated-human lung fibroblast-derived PD-L1 into extracellular vesicles (EVs) capable of inhibiting T cell proliferation in response to T cell receptor stimulation and mediating fibroblast cell migration. These findings provide new insights and potential targets for a variety of fibrotic and malignant diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2998484454,"It remains unclear whether and, if so, how nonhuman animals make on-the-fly predictions during pursuit. Here we used a novel laboratory pursuit task that incentivizes the prediction of future prey positions. We trained three macaques to perform a joystick-controlled pursuit task in which prey follow intelligent escape algorithms. Subjects aimed toward the likely future positions of the prey, which indicated that they generate internal predictions and use these to guide behavior. We then developed a generative model that explains real-time pursuit trajectories and showed that our subjects use prey position, velocity and acceleration to make predictions. We identified neurons in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex whose responses track these three variables. These neurons multiplexed prediction-related variables with a distinct and explicit representation of the future position of the prey. Our results provide a clear demonstration that the brain can explicitly represent future predictions and highlight the critical role of anterior cingulate cortex for future-oriented cognition. Yoo and colleagues find that while pursuing virtual prey, monkeys predict the prey’s upcoming movements, and neurons in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex tracked prey position, velocity and acceleration to facilitate these predictions."
https://openalex.org/W2994756824,"RNA-binding proteins like human antigen R (HuR) are key regulators in post-transcriptional control of gene expression in several pathophysiological conditions. Diabetes adversely affects monocyte/macrophage biology and function. It is not known whether diabetic milieu affects cellular/exosome-HuR and its implications on cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. Here, we evaluate in vitro and in vivo effects of diabetic milieu on macrophage cellular/exosome-HuR, alterations in intercellular cross talk with fibroblasts, and its impact on cardiac remodeling. Human failing hearts show higher HuR levels. Diabetic milieu activates HuR expression in cardiac- and cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMØ) and stimulates HuR nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation and exosome transfer. Exosomes from macrophages exposed to diabetic milieu (high glucose or db/db mice) significantly increase inflammatory and profibrogenic responses in fibroblast (in vitro) and cardiac fibrosis in mice. Intriguingly, Exo-HuR deficiency (HuR knockdown in macrophage) abrogates the above effects. In diabetic mice, macrophage depletion followed by reconstitution with BMMØ-derived HuR-deficient exosomes inhibits angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibrosis response and preserves left ventricle function as compared to control-exosome administration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that diabetes activates BMMØ HuR expression and its transfer into exosome. The data suggest that HuR might be targeted to alleviate macrophage dysfunction and pathological fibrosis in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2997261330,"Arc, a neuronal gene that is critical for synaptic plasticity, originated through the domestication of retrotransposon Gag genes and mediates intercellular messenger RNA transfer. We report high-resolution structures of retrovirus-like capsids formed by Drosophila dArc1 and dArc2 that have surface spikes and putative internal RNA-binding domains. These data demonstrate that virus-like capsid-forming properties of Arc are evolutionarily conserved and provide a structural basis for understanding their function in intercellular communication."

https://openalex.org/W2997624136,"Several lines of evidence have revealed the potential of microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) as biomarkers for detecting diabetic cardiomyopathy, although their functions in hyperglycemic cardiac dysfunction are still lacking. In this study, mitochondrial biogenesis was markedly impaired induced by high glucose (HG), as evidenced by dysregulated mitochondrial structure, reduced mitochondrial DNA contents, and biogenesis-related mRNA levels, accompanied by increased cell apoptosis. MiR-144 was identified to be decreased in HG-induced cardiomyocytes and in streptozotocin (STZ)-challenged heart samples. Forced miR-144 expression enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and suppressed cell apoptosis, while miR-144 inhibition exhibited the opposite results. Rac-1 was identified as a target gene of miR-144. Decreased Rac-1 levels activated AMPK phosphorylation and PGC-1α deacetylation, leading to increased mitochondrial biogenesis and reduced cell apoptosis. Importantly, the systemic neutralization of miR-144 attenuated mitochondrial disorder and ventricular dysfunction following STZ treatment. Additionally, plasma miR-144 decreased markedly in diabetic patients with cardiac dysfunction. The receiver-operator characteristic curve showed that plasma miR-144 could specifically predict diabetic patients developing cardiac dysfunction. In conclusion, this study provides strong evidence suggesting that miR-144 protects heart from hyperglycemia-induced injury by improving mitochondrial biogenesis and decreasing cell apoptosis via targeting Rac-1. Forced miR-144 expression might, thus, be a protective strategy for treating hyperglycemia-induced cardiac dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2996678697,"Studies in mice with ablation of Prnp, the gene that encodes the cellular prion protein (PrPC ), have led to the hypothesis that PrPC is important for peripheral nerve myelin maintenance. Here, we have used a nontransgenic animal model to put this idea to the test; namely, goats that, due to a naturally occurring nonsense mutation, lack PrPC . Teased nerve fiber preparation revealed a demyelinating pathology in goats without PrPC . Affected nerves were invaded by macrophages and T cells and displayed vacuolated fibers, shrunken axons, and onion bulbs. Peripheral nerve lipid composition was similar in young goats with or without PrPC , but markedly different between corresponding groups of adult goats, reflecting the progressive nature of the neuropathy. This is the first report of a subclinical demyelinating polyneuropathy caused by loss of PrPC function in a nontransgenic mammal."
https://openalex.org/W2998209057,"Fibrinogen-like-protein 1 (FGL1) is a novel hepatokine that plays an important role in hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Although FGL1 expression can be detected in adipose tissues, the functions of FGL1 in adipose tissues are still unknown. In this study, 356 participants with (body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2 ; n = 134) or without obesity (BMI <25 kg/m2 ; n = 222) were recruited, and we found that the plasma FGL1 concentrations were significantly higher in obese group than those of in the normal weight group, and were positively correlated with age, BMI, waist circumference, fat content, plasma glucose at 2 hours during an oral glucose tolerance test, and the insulin sensitivity index. In univariate analyses, BMI, waist circumference, total fat, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat areas were positively correlated with FGL1 levels. After adjusting for age and gender, obesity indices, including the BMI and different fat areas, remained significantly associated with FGL1 levels. In order to investigate the causal relationship between FGL1 and obesity, animal and cell models were used. Overexpression of FGL1 in epididymal adipose tissue by lentiviral vector encoding FGL1 increased the fat pad size, whereas FGL1-knockdown by lentiviral vector encoding short-hairpin RNA targeted to FGL1 decreased high-fat diet-induced adiposity. In addition, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used to clarify the possible mechanism of FGL1-induced adipogenesis. FGL1 induced adipogenesis through an ERK1/2-C/EBPβ-dependent pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These findings highlight the pathophysiological role of FGL1 in obesity, and FGL1 might be a novel therapeutic target to combat obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2996848510,"Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) play a critical role in the innate immune response to invading pathogens. However, dysregulated mucosal trafficking of PMNs and associated epithelial tissue damage is a pathological hallmark of numerous inflammatory conditions including inflammatory bowel disease. The glycoprotein CD11b/CD18 plays a well-described role in regulating PMN transepithelial migration and PMN inflammatory functions. Previous studies have demonstrated that targeting of the N-linked glycan Lewis X on CD11b blocks PMN transepithelial migration (TEpM). Given evidence of glycosylation-dependent regulation of CD11b/CD18 function, we performed MALDI TOF Mass Spectrometry (MS) analyses on CD11b/CD18 purified from human PMNs. Unusual glycan epitopes identified on CD11b/CD18 included high Mannose oligosaccharides recognized by the Galanthus Nivalis lectin and biantennary galactosylated N-glycans recognized by the Phaseolus Vulgaris erythroagglutinin lectin. Importantly, we show that selective targeting of glycans on CD11b with such lectins results in altered intracellular signaling events that inhibit TEpM and differentially affect key PMN inflammatory functions including phagocytosis, superoxide release and apoptosis. Taken together, these data demonstrate that discrete glycan motifs expressed on CD11b/CD18 such as biantennary galactose could represent novel targets for selective manipulation of CD11b function and reduction of PMN-associated tissue damage in chronic inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2997137076,"Src Homology 2-containing Inositol Phosphatase-1 (SHIP-1) is a target of miR-155, a pro-inflammatory factor. Deletion of the SHIP-1 gene in mice caused spontaneous lung inflammation and fibrosis. However, the role and function of endothelial miR-155 and SHIP-1 in lung fibrosis remain unknown. Using whole-body miR-155 knockout mice and endothelial cell-specific conditional miR-155 (VEC-Cre-miR-155 or VEC-miR-155) or SHIP-1 (VEC-SHIP-1) knockout mice, we assessed endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) and fibrotic responses in bleomycin (BLM) induced lung fibrosis models. Primary mouse lung endothelial cells (MLEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with SHIP-1 knockdown were analyzed in TGF-β1 or BLM, respectively, induced fibrotic responses. Fibrosis and EndoMT were significantly reduced in miR-155KO mice and changes in EndoMT markers in MLEC after TGF-β1 stimulation confirmed the in vivo findings. Furthermore, lung fibrosis and EndoMT responses were reduced in VEC-miR-155 mice but significantly enhanced in VEC-SHIP-1 mice after BLM challenge. SHIP-1 knockdown in HUVEC cells resulted in enhanced EndoMT induced by BLM. Meanwhile, these changes involved the PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT3, and SMAD/STAT signaling pathways. These studies demonstrate that endothelial miR-155 plays an important role in fibrotic responses in the lung through EndoMT. Endothelial SHIP-1 is essential in controlling fibrotic responses and SHIP-1 is a target of miR-155. Endothelial cells are an integral part in lung fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2996546778,"Recent studies have demonstrated an essential role for insulin signaling in folliculogenesis as conditional ablation of Igf1r in primary follicles elicits defective follicle-stimulating hormone responsiveness blocking development at the preantral stage. Thus the potential role of insulin action in the periovulatory window and in the corpus luteum is unknown. To examine this, we generated conditional Insr,Igf1r, and double receptor knockout mice driven by Pgr-Cre. These models escape the preantral follicle block and in response to superovulatory gonadotropins exhibit normal distribution of ovarian follicles and corpora lutea. However, single ablation of Igf1r leads to subfertility and mice lacking both receptors are infertile. Double knockout mice have impaired oocyte development and ovulation. While some oocytes are released and fertilized, subsequent embryo development is retarded, and the embryos potentially fail to thrive due to lack of luteal support. In support of this, we found reduced expression of key enzymes in the steroid synthesis pathway and reduced serum progesterone. In addition to metabolic and steroidogenic pathways, RNA-sequencing analysis revealed transcription factor-3 as an important transcription factor downstream of insulin signaling. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of growth factors of the insulin family during two distinct windows of follicular development, ovulation, and luteinization."
https://openalex.org/W2998292954,"The maternal nucleolus plays an indispensable role in zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and early embryonic development in mice. During oocyte-to-embryo transition, the nucleolus is subject to substantial transformation. Despite the primary role of the nucleolus is ribosome biogenesis, accumulating evidence has uncovered its functions in various other cell processes. However, the regulation of nucleolar maturation and ribosome biogenesis and the molecules involved remain unclear during early embryonic development. In this study, we observed that nucleolar protein 2 (NOP2) is restrictedly localized within the nucleolus, first detected in the late two-cell embryos, and increases to a peak level at the eight-cell stage in mice. RNAi-mediated NOP2 depletion leads to a developmental arrest during the morula-to-blastocyst transition. RNA-seq analyses reveal that 208 genes are differentially expressed, including multiple lineage-specific genes and several genes encoding ribosome proteins. Indeed, we observe a failure of the first lineage specification with reduced TEA domain transcription factor 4(TEAD4) (trophectoderm-specific), tir na nog (NANOG), and kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) (inner cell mass-specific). Importantly, by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), we noted a decrease in the ratio of the nucleolus size and an increase in the ratio of the size of the nucleolus precursor body, suggesting the nucleolar maturation is disrupted. Moreover, both qPCR and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) data showcase a significant decrease in the abundance of ribosome RNAs. Similarly, NOP2 depletion causes reduced developmental potential and decreased rRNA level in bovine early embryos, suggesting a functional conservation of NOP2 in mammals. Taken together, these results suggest that NOP2 is required for mammalian preimplantation development, presumably by regulating nucleolar maturation and ribosome biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2998552676,"Proteinuria is associated with renal function decline and cardiovascular mortality. This association may be attributed in part to alterations of Klotho expression induced by albuminuria, yet the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The presence of albumin decreased Klotho expression in the POD-ATTAC mouse model of proteinuric kidney disease as well as in kidney epithelial cell lines. This downregulation was related to both decreased Klotho transcription and diminished protein half-life, whereas cleavage by ADAM proteases was not modified. The regulation was albumin specific since it was neither observed in the analbuminemic Col4α3-/- Alport mice nor induced by exposure of kidney epithelial cells to purified immunoglobulins. Albumin induced features of ER stress in renal tubular cells with ATF3/ATF4 activation. ATF3 and ATF4 induction downregulated Klotho through altered transcription mediated by their binding on the Klotho promoter. Inhibiting ER stress with 4-PBA decreased the effect of albumin on Klotho protein levels without altering mRNA levels, thus mainly abrogating the increased protein degradation. Taken together, albuminuria decreases Klotho expression through increased protein degradation and decreased transcription mediated by ER stress induction. This implies that modulating ER stress may improve proteinuria-induced alterations of Klotho expression, and hence renal and extrarenal complications associated with Klotho loss."
https://openalex.org/W2995125541,"Clinical studies have indicated that obesity and diabetes are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neurodegeneration. Although the mechanisms underlying these associations remain elusive, the bidirectional interactions between obesity/diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be involved in them. Both obesity/diabetes and AD significantly reduce life expectancy. We generated AppNL-F/wt knock-in; ob/ob mice by crossing AppNL-F/wt knock-in mice and ob/ob mice to investigate whether amyloid-β (Aβ) affects the lifespan of ob/ob mice. AppNL-F/wt knock-in; ob/ob mice displayed the shortest lifespan compared to wild-type mice, AppNL-F/wt knock-in mice, and ob/ob mice. Notably, the Aβ42 levels were increased at minimum levels before deposition in AppNL-F/wt knock-in mice and AppNL-F/wt knock-in; ob/ob mice at 18 months of age. No differences in the levels of several neuronal markers were observed between mice at this age. However, we observed increased levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocyte marker, in AppNL-F/wt knock-in; ob/ob mice, while the levels of several microglial markers, including CD11b, TREM2, and DAP12, were decreased in both ob/ob mice and AppNL-F/wt knock-in; ob/ob mice. The increase in GFAP levels was not observed in young AppNL-F/wt knock-in; ob/ob mice. Thus, the increased Aβ42 levels may decrease the lifespan of ob/ob mice, which is associated with the dysregulation of microglia and astrocytes in an age-dependent manner. Based on these findings, the imbalance in these neuroinflammatory cells may provide a clue to the mechanisms by which the interaction between obesity/diabetes and early AD reduces life expectancy."
https://openalex.org/W2997790815,"In spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, large amounts of reactive oxygen species can cause mitochondrial damage. Therefore, mitophagy acts as the main mechanism for removing damaged mitochondria and protects nerve cells. This study aimed to illustrate the important role of GPCR kinase 2–interacting protein-1 (GIT1) in mitophagy in vivo and in vitro. The level of mitophagy in the neurons of Git1 knockout mice was significantly reduced after ischemia-reperfusion. However, the overexpression of adeno-associated virus with Git1 promoted mitophagy and inhibited the apoptosis of neurons. GIT1 regulated the phosphorylation of Beclin-1 in Thr119, which could promote the translocation of Parkin to the mitochondrial outer membrane. This process was independent of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), but it could not rescue the role in the absence of PINK1. Overall, GIT1 enhanced mitophagy and protected neurons against ischemia-reperfusion injury and, hence, might serve as a new research site for the protection of ischemia-reperfusion injury."
https://openalex.org/W2995990966,"Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile; C difficile), the leading cause of nosocomial antibiotic-associated colitis and diarrhea in the industrialized world, triggers colonic disease through the release two toxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), glucosyltransferases that modulate monomeric G-protein function and alter cytoskeletal function. The initial degree of the host immune response to C difficile and its pathogenic toxins is a common indicator of disease severity and infection recurrence. Thus, targeting the intestinal inflammatory response during infection could significantly decrease disease morbidity and mortality. In the current study, we sought to interrogate the influence of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), a modulator of xenobiotic and detoxification responses, which can sense and respond to microbial metabolites and modulates inflammatory activity, during exposure to TcdA and TcdB. Following intrarectal exposure to TcdA/B, PXR-deficient mice (Nr1i2-/- ) exhibited reduced survival, an effect that was associated with increased levels of innate immune cell influx. This exacerbated response was associated with a twofold increase in the expression of Tlr4. Furthermore, while broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment (to deplete the intestinal microbiota) did not alter the responses in Nr1i2-/- mice, blocking TLR4 signaling significantly reduced TcdA/B-induced disease severity and immune responses in these mice. Lastly, to assess the therapeutic potential of targeting the PXR, we activated the PXR with pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile (PCN) in wild-type mice, which greatly reduced the severity of TcdA/B-induced damage and intestinal inflammation. Taken together, these data suggest that the PXR plays a role in the host's response to TcdA/B and may provide a novel target to dampen the inflammatory tissue damage in C difficile infections."

Its inhibition is a major therapeutic approach in Alzheimer's disease, because BACE1 cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP), thereby catalyzing the first step in the generation of the pathogenic amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide. Yet, BACE1 cleaves numerous additional membrane proteins besides APP. Most of these substrates have been identified in vitro, but only few were further validated or characterized in vivo. To identify BACE1 substrates with in vivo relevance, we used isotope label-based quantitative proteomics of wild type and BACE1-deficient (BACE1 KO) mouse brains. This approach identified known BACE1 substrates, including Close homolog of L1 and contactin-2, which were found to be enriched in the membrane fraction of BACE1 KO brains. VWFA and cache domain-containing protein 1 (CACHD)1 and MAM domain-containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor protein 1 (MDGA1), which have functions in synaptic transmission, were identified and validated as new BACE1 substrates in vivo by immunoblots using primary neurons and mouse brains. Inhibition or deletion of BACE1 from primary neurons resulted in a pronounced inhibition of substrate cleavage and a concomitant increase in full-length protein levels of CACHD1 and MDGA1. The BACE1 cleavage site in both proteins was determined to be located within the juxtamembrane domain. In summary, this study identifies and validates CACHD1 and MDGA1 as novel in vivo substrates for BACE1, suggesting that cleavage of both proteins may contribute to the numerous functions of BACE1 in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2995051143,"The epidemiological evidence regarding the association of obesity with liver disease and possibly hepatocellular carcinoma highlights the need for investigations of whether obesity itself could induce the differential expression of genes commonly associated with the initial phase of liver tumorigenesis, and whether such phenomenon could be reversed after a weight loss intervention. In this study, obese Zucker rats were found to have dysregulated cell proliferation, antioxidative defenses, and tumor suppressor gene expression in association with liver dysfunction parameters, as well as oxidative stress and inflammation. Importantly, after a 4-week weight loss protocol of energy restriction and/or exercise, this effect on the liver carcinogenesis-related genes was reversed concomitantly with reductions in the fat mass, hepatic lipid content, oxidative stress, and inflammation. The findings indicate that the oxidative stress and inflammation associated with excess adiposity promote dysregulation of the genes involved in liver tumorigenesis. This is clinically relevant because these effects were detectable in the liver without evidence of a tumoral mass and were reversed after weight loss. Consequently, this study reveals the susceptibility of obese individuals to the initiation of a hepatocarcinogenic process, and how this can be prevented by achieving a healthy body weight."
https://openalex.org/W2995121400,"Profilin is a major regulator of actin dynamics in multiple specific processes localized in different cellular compartments. This specificity is not only meditated by its binding to actin but also its interaction with phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) at the membrane and a plethora of proteins containing poly-L-proline (PLP) stretches. These interactions are fine-tuned by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation. Several phospho-sites have already been identified for profilin1, the ubiquitously expressed isoform. However, little is known about the phosphorylation of profilin2a. Profilin2a is a neuronal isoform important for synapse function. Here, we identified several putative profilin2a phospho-sites in silico and tested recombinant phospho-mimetics with regard to their actin-, PLP-, and PIP2-binding properties. Moreover, we assessed their impact on actin dynamics employing a pyrene-actin polymerization assay. Results indicate that distinct phospho-sites modulate specific profilin2a functions. We could identify a molecular switch site at serine residue 71 which completely abrogated actin binding—as well as other sites important for fine-tuning of different functions, for example, tyrosine 29 for PLP binding. Our findings suggest that differential profilin2a phosphorylation is a sensitive mechanism for regulating its neuronal functions. Moreover, the dysregulation of profilin2a phosphorylation may contribute to neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2995447197,"The small GTPase Ras-related protein Rab-7a (Rab7a) serves as a key organizer of the endosomal-lysosomal system. However, molecular mechanisms controlling Rab7a activation levels and subcellular translocation are still poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that type Igamma phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-kinase i5 (PIPKIγi5), an endosome-localized enzyme that produces phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, directly interacts with Rab7a and plays critical roles in the control of the endosomal-lysosomal system. The loss of PIPKIγi5 blocks Rab7a recruitment to early endosomes, which prevents the maturation of early to late endosomes. PIPKIγi5 loss disturbs retromer complex connection with Rab7a, which blocks the retrograde sorting of Cation-independent Mannose 6-Phosphate Receptor from late endosomes. This leads to the decreased sorting of hydrolases to lysosomes and reduces the autophagic degradation. By modulating the retromer-Rab7a connection, PIPKIγi5 is also required for the recruitment of the GTPase-activating protein TBC1 domain family member 5 to late endosomes, which controls the conversion of Rab7a from the active state to the inactive state. Thus, PIPKIγi5 is critical for the modulation of Rab7a activity, localization, and function in the endosomal-lysosomal system."
https://openalex.org/W2998017678,"Iron is an essential element to all living organisms and plays a vital role in many cellular processes, such as DNA synthesis and energy production. The Mdm2 oncogene is an E3 ligase and known to promote tumor growth. However, the role of Mdm2 in iron homeostasis is not certain. Here, we showed that Mdm2 expression was increased by iron depletion but decreased by iron repletion. We also showed that Iron Regulatory Protein 2 (IRP2) mediated iron-regulated Mdm2 expression. Specifically, Mdm2 expression was increased by ectopic IRP2 but decreased by knockdown or knockout of IRP2 in human cancer cells as well as in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In addition, we showed that IRP2-regulated Mdm2 expression was independent of tumor suppressor p53. Mechanistically, we found that IRP2 stabilized Mdm2 transcript via binding to an iron response element (IRE) in the 3'UTR of Mdm2 mRNA. Finally, we showed that Mdm2 is required for IRP2-mediated cell proliferation and Mdm2 expression is highly associated with IRP2 in both the normal and cancerous liver tissues. Together, we uncover a novel regulation of Mdm2 by IRP2 via mRNA stability and that the IRP2-Mdm2 axis may play a critical role in cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2995392726,"The skeleton of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) has deteriorated mechanical integrity and increased fragility, whereas the mechanisms are not fully understood. Load-induced microdamage naturally occurs in bone matrix and can be removed by initiating endogenous targeted bone remodeling. However, the microdamage accumulation in diabetic skeleton and the corresponding bone remodeling mechanisms remain poorly understood. Herein, streptozotocin-induced T1DM rats and age-matched non-diabetic rats were subjected to daily uniaxial ulnar loading for 1, 4, 7, and 10 days, respectively. The SPECT/CT and basic fuchsin staining revealed significant higher-density spatial accumulation of linear and diffuse microdamage in diabetic ulnae than non-diabetic ulnae. Linear microcracks increased within 10-day loading in diabetic bone, whereas peaked at Day 7 in non-diabetic bone. Moreover, diabetic fatigued ulnae had more severe disruptions of osteocyte canaliculi around linear microcracks. Immunostaining results revealed that diabetes impaired targeted remodeling in fatigued bone at every key stage, including increased apoptosis of bystander osteocytes, decreased RANKL secretion, reduced osteoclast recruitment and bone resorption, and impaired osteoblast-mediated bone formation. This study characterizes microdamage accumulation and abnormal remodeling mechanisms in the diabetic skeleton, which advances our etiologic understanding of diabetic bone deterioration and increased fragility from the aspect of microdamage accumulation and bone remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2997371683,"Humans and orcas are among the very rare species that have a prolonged post-reproductive lifespan (PRLS), during which the aging process continues. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from mitochondria and from the NADPH oxidase (NOX) enzymes of innate immune cells are known to contribute to aging, with the former thought to be dominant. CD33-related-Siglecs are immune receptors that recognize self-associated-molecular-patterns and modulate NOX-derived-ROS. We herewith demonstrate a strong correlation of lifespan with CD33rSIGLEC gene number in 26 species, independent of body weight or phylogeny. The correlation is stronger when considering total CD33rSIGLEC gene number rather than those encoding inhibitory and activating subsets, suggesting that lifetime balancing of ROS is important. Combining independent lines of evidence including the short half-life and spontaneous activation of neutrophils, we calculate that even without inter-current inflammation, a major source of lifetime ROS exposure may actually be neutrophil NOX-derived. However, genomes of human supercentenarians (>110 years) do not harbor a significantly higher number of functional CD33rSIGLEC genes. Instead, lifespan correlation with CD33rSIGLEC gene number was markedly strengthened by excluding the post-reproductive lifespan of humans and orcas (R2  = 0.83; P < .0001). Thus, CD33rSIGLEC modulation of ROS likely contributes to maximum reproductive lifespan, but other unknown mechanisms could be important to PRLS."
https://openalex.org/W2994772464,"The myometrium undergoes structural and functional remodeling during pregnancy. We hypothesize that myometrial genomic elements alter correspondingly in preparation for parturition. Human myometrial tissues from nonpregnant (NP) and term pregnant (TP) human subjects were examined by RNAseq, ATACseq, and PGR ChIPseq assays to profile transcriptome, assessible genome, and PGR occupancy. NP and TP specimens exhibit 2890 differentially expressed genes, reflecting an increase of metabolic, inflammatory, and PDGF signaling, among others, in adaptation to pregnancy. At the epigenome level, patterns of accessible genome change between NP and TP myometrium, leading to the altered enrichment of binding motifs for hormone and muscle regulators such as the progesterone receptor (PGR), Krüppel-like factors, and MEF2A transcription factors. PGR genome occupancy exhibits a significant difference between the two stages of the myometrium, concomitant with distinct transcriptomic profiles including genes such as ENO1, LHDA, and PLCL1 in the glycolytic and calcium signaling pathways. Over-representation of SRF, MYOD, and STAT binding motifs in PGR occupying sites further suggests interactions between PGR and major muscle regulators for myometrial gene expression. In conclusion, changes in accessible genome and PGR occupancy are part of the myometrial remodeling process and may serve as mechanisms to formulate the state-specific transcriptome profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2997019762,"Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units. Previously, we identified Protein Kinase C-delta (PKCδ) as an important regulator of the inflammatory response in sepsis. An important issue in development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics is the risk of immunosuppression and inability to effectively clear pathogens. In this study, we investigated whether PKCδ inhibition prevented organ dysfunction and improved survival without compromising pathogen clearance. Sprague Dawley rats underwent sham surgery or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce sepsis. Post-surgery, PBS or a PKCδ inhibitor (200µg/kg) was administered intra-tracheally (IT). At 24 hours post-CLP, there was evidence of lung and kidney dysfunction. PKCδ inhibition decreased leukocyte influx in these organs, decreased endothelial permeability, improved gas exchange, and reduced blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratios indicating organ protection. PKCδ inhibition significantly decreased bacterial levels in the peritoneal cavity, spleen and blood but did not exhibit direct bactericidal properties. Peritoneal chemokine levels, neutrophil numbers, or macrophage phenotypes were not altered by PKCδ inhibition. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from PKCδ inhibitor-treated septic rats demonstrated increased bacterial phagocytosis. Importantly, PKCδ inhibition increased survival. Thus, PKCδ inhibition improved survival and improved survival was associated with increased phagocytic activity, enhanced pathogen clearance, and decreased organ injury."
https://openalex.org/W2997550312,"Nutritional status during intrauterine and/or early postnatal life has substantial influence on adult offspring health. Along these lines, there is a growing body of evidence illustrating that high fat diet (HFD)-induced maternal obesity can regulate fetal bone development. Thus, we investigated the effects of maternal obesity on both fetal skeletal development and mechanisms linking maternal obesity to osteoblast differentiation in offspring. Embryonic osteogenic calvarial cells (EOCCs) were isolated from fetuses at gestational day 18.5 (E18.5) of HFD-induced obese rat dams. We observed impaired differentiation of EOCCs to mature osteoblasts from HFD obese dams. ChIP-seq-based genome-wide localization of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 (mediated via the polycomb histone methyltransferase, enhancer of zeste homologue 2 [Ezh2]) showed that this phenotype was associated with increased enrichment of H3K27me3 on the gene of SATB2, a critical transcription factor required for osteoblast differentiation. Knockdown of Ezh2 in EOCCs and ST2 cells increased SATB2 expression; while Ezh2 overexpression in EOCCs and ST2 cells decreased SATB2 expression. These data were consistent with experimental results showing strong association between H3K27me3, Ezh2, and SATB2 in cells from rats and humans. We have further presented that SATB2 mRNA and protein expression were increased in bones, and increased trabecular bone mass from pre-osteoblast specific Ezh2 deletion (Ezh2flox/flox Osx-Cre+ cko) mice compared with those from control Cre+ mice. These findings indicate that maternal HFD-induced obesity may be associated with decreasing fetal pre-osteoblastic cell differentiation, under epigenetic control of SATB2 expression via Ezh2-dependent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2998624963,"Despite the use of antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, cognitive impairments, that is, HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders remain prevalent potentially due to persistent viral replication, production of viral proteins, associated brain inflammation or in certain instances, antiretroviral neurotoxicity. Cellular targets in the brain include microglia which in response to infection release inflammatory markers and viral proteins. Evidence suggests that PPARγ agonists exert anti-inflammatory properties in neurological disorders. However, these agonists namely, thiazolidinediones have limited use in the clinic due to reported adverse side effects. INT131 is a novel non-thiazolidinedione compound that belongs to a new class of drugs known as selective PPARγ modulators. INT131 is considered to have a safer profile; however, its neuroprotective role in vivo is not known.The goal of this study was to examine the effect of INT131 in the context of EcoHIV-induced inflammation in vitro, in primary cultures of mouse glial cells and in vivo, in a mouse model of EcoHIV-associated brain inflammation, as well as characterize its pharmacokinetic properties and brain penetration. In primary cultures of glial cells and in the in vivo mouse model, EcoHIV exposure resulted in a significant elevation of inflammatory markers such as TNFα, IL-1β, CCL3, and C3 which were attenuated with INT131 treatment. Pharmacokinetic analyses revealed that INT131 penetrates into the brain with a brain to blood partition ratio Kp value of 8.5%. Overall, this is the first report to demonstrate that INT131 could be a potential candidate for the treatment of HIV-1-associated brain inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2998722651,"All drugs recently developed in rodent models to treat inflammatory disease have failed in clinical trials. We therefore used our novel biomimetic microfluidic assay (bMFA) to determine whether the response of murine cells to inflammatory activation or anti-inflammatory treatment is predictive of the response in human cells. Under physiologically relevant flow conditions, permeability and transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of human or mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC or MLMVEC), and neutrophil-endothelial cell interaction was measured. The differential impact of a protein kinase C-delta TAT peptide inhibitor (PKCδ-i) was also quantified. Permeability of HLMVEC and MLMVEC was similar under control conditions but tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and PKCδ-i had a significantly higher impact on permeability of HLMVEC. TEER across HLMVEC was significantly higher than MLMVEC, but PKCδ-i returned TEER to background levels only in human cells. The kinetics of N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-mediated neutrophil migration was significantly different between the two species and PKCδ-i was significantly more effective in attenuating human neutrophil migration. However, human and mouse neutrophil adhesion patterns to microvascular endothelium were not significantly different. Surprisingly, while intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) was significantly upregulated on activated HLMVEC, it was not significantly upregulated on activated MLMVEC. Responses to activation and anti-inflammatory treatment in mice may not always be predictive of their response in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2995491379,"Loss of tumor suppressor activity and upregulation of oncogenic pathways simultaneously contribute to tumorigenesis. Expression of the tumor suppressor, GCIP (Grap2- and cyclin D1-interacting protein), is usually reduced or lost in advanced cancers, as seen in both mouse tumor models and human cancer patients. However, no previous study has examined how cancer cells down-regulate GCIP expression. In this study, we first validate the tumor suppressive function of GCIP using clinical gastric cancer tissues and online database analysis. We then reveal a novel mechanism whereby MEK2 directly interacts with and phosphorylates GCIP at its Ser313 and Ser356 residues to promote the turnover of GCIP by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. We also reveal that decreased GCIP stability enhances cell proliferation and promotes cancer cell migration and invasion. Taken together, these findings provide a more comprehensive view of GCIP in tumorigenesis and suggest that the oncogenic MEK/ERK signaling pathway negatively regulates the protein level of GCIP to promote cell proliferation and migration."

Although the structure and function of AKT-coding genes of C. elegans are understood, this is not the case for homologous genes in parasitic nematodes. In the present study, we explored a C. elegans akt-1 gene homolog in the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus, investigated its transcript isoforms (Hc-akt-1a and Hc-akt-1b), and studied expression and function using both homologous and heterologous functional genomic tools. In C. elegans, we showed that the predicted promoter of Hc-akt-1 drives substantial expression in ASJ neurons of the N2 (wild-type) strain. In H. contortus (Haecon-5 stain), RNAi (soaking) led to a significantly decreased transcript abundance for both Hc-akt-1a and Hc-akt-1b, and reduced larval development in larval stages in vitro. Chemical inhibition was also shown to block larval development. Taken together, the evidence from this study points to a key functional role for Hc-akt-1 in H. contortus."
https://openalex.org/W2997662889,"Covariant residues identified by computational algorithms have provided new insights into enzyme evolutionary routes. However, the reliability and accuracy of routine statistical coupling analysis (SCA) are unable to satisfy the needs of protein engineering because SCA depends only on sequence information. Here, we set up a new SCA algorithm, SCA.SIM, by integrating structure information and MD simulation data. The more reliable covariant residues with high-quality scores are obtained from sequence alignment weighted by residual movement for eight related subfamilies, belonging to α/β hydrolase family, with Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB). The 38 predicted covariant residues are tested for function by high-throughput quantitative evaluation in combination with activity and thermostability assays of a mutant library and deep sequencing. Based on the landscapes of both activity and thermostability, most mutants play key roles in catalysis, and some mutants gain 2.4- to 6-fold increase in half-life at 50°C and 9- to 12-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency. The activity of double mutants for A225F/T103A is higher than those of A225F and T103A which means that SCA.SIM method might be useful for identifying the allosteric coupling. The SCA.SIM algorithm can be used for protein coevolution and enzyme engineering research."
https://openalex.org/W2999597377,"Many members of the mucin family are evolutionarily conserved and are often aberrantly expressed and glycosylated in various benign and malignant pathologies leading to tumor invasion, metastasis, and immune evasion. The large size and extensive glycosylation present challenges to study the mucin structure using traditional methods, including crystallography. We offer the hypothesis that the functional versatility of mucins may be attributed to the presence of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that provide dynamism and flexibility and that the IDRs offer potential therapeutic targets. Herein, we examined the links between the mucin structure and function based on IDRs, posttranslational modifications (PTMs), and potential impact on their interactome. Using sequence-based bioinformatics tools, we observed that mucins are predicted to be moderately (20%-40%) to highly (>40%) disordered and many conserved mucin domains could be disordered. Phosphorylation sites overlap with IDRs throughout the mucin sequences. Additionally, the majority of predicted O- and N- glycosylation sites in the tandem repeat regions occur within IDRs and these IDRs contain a large number of functional motifs, that is, molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which directly influence protein-protein interactions (PPIs). This investigation provides a novel perspective and offers an insight into the complexity and dynamic nature of mucins."
https://openalex.org/W2996294220,"Caveolae play crucial roles in intracellular membrane trafficking and mechanosensation. In this study, we report that synaptotagmin-11 (Syt11), a synaptotagmin isoform associated with Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, regulates both caveolae-mediated endocytosis and the caveolar response to mechanical stimuli in astrocytes. Syt11-knockout (KO) accelerated caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Interestingly, the caveolar structures on the cell surface were markedly fewer in the absence of Syt11. Caveolar disassembly in response to hypoosmotic stimuli and astrocyte swelling were both impaired in Syt11-KO astrocytes. Live imaging revealed that Syt11 left caveolar structures before cavin1 during hypoosmotic stress and returned earlier than cavin1 after isoosmotic recovery. Chronic hypoosmotic stress led to proteasome-mediated Syt11 degradation. In addition, Syt11-KO increased the turnover of cavin1 and EH domain-containing protein 2 (EHD2), accompanied by compromised membrane integrity, suggesting a mechanoprotective role of Syt11. Direct interactions between Syt11 and cavin1 and EHD2, but not caveolin-1, are found. Altogether, we propose that Syt11 stabilizes caveolar structures on the cell surface of astrocytes and regulates caveolar functions under physiological and pathological conditions through cavin1 and EHD2."
https://openalex.org/W2998486416,"The mechanism of sodium retention and its location in kidney tubules may vary with time in nephrotic syndrome (NS). We studied the mechanisms of sodium retention in transgenic POD-ATTAC mice, which display an inducible podocyte-specific apoptosis. At day 2 after the induction of NS, the increased abundance of NHE3 and phosphorylated NCC in nephrotic mice compared with controls suggest that early sodium retention occurs mainly in the proximal and distal tubules. At day 3, the abundance of NHE3 normalized, phosphorylated NCC levels decreased, and cleavage and apical localization of γ-ENaC increased in nephrotic mice. These findings indicate that sodium retention shifted from the proximal and distal tubules to the collecting system. Increased cleavage and apical localization of γ-ENaC persisted at day 5 in nephrotic mice when hypovolemia resolved and steady-state was reached. Sodium retention and γ-ENaC cleavage were independent of the increased plasma levels of aldosterone. Nephrotic mice displayed decreased glomerular filtration rate and urinary potassium excretion associated with hyperkaliemia at day 3. Feeding nephrotic mice with a low potassium diet prevented hyperkaliemia, γ-ENaC cleavage, and led to persistent increased phosphorylation of NCC. These results suggest that potassium homeostasis is a major determinant of the tubular site of sodium retention in nephrotic mice."

This reaction regulates various biological functions like cell growth, differentiation, and it is crucial for maintaining organ homeostasis. However, the actions of SUMO in skeletal muscle pathophysiology are still not investigated. In this study, we quantified the abundance of the SUMO enzymes and determined the distribution of SUMOylated proteins along the fibers of nine different muscles. We find that skeletal muscles contain a distinctive group of SUMO enzymes and SUMOylated proteins in relation to their different metabolism, functions, and fiber type composition. In addition, before the activation of protein degradation pathways, this unique set is quickly altered in response to muscle sedentariness. Finally, we demonstrated that PAX6 acts as an upstream regulator of the SUMO conjugation reaction, which can become a potential therapeutic marker to prevent muscle diseases generated by inactivity."
