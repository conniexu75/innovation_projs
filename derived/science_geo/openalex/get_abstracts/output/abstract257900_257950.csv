https://openalex.org/W1976414476,"DNA site-specific recombinases (SSRs) such as Cre, FLPe, and phiC31, are powerful tools for analyzing gene function in vertebrates. While the availability of multiple high-efficiency SSRs would facilitate a wide array of genomic engineering possibilities, efficient recombination in mammalian cells has only been observed with Cre recombinase. Here we report the de novo synthesis of mouse codon-optimized FLP (FLPo) and PhiC31 (PhiC31o) SSRs, which result in recombination efficiencies similar to Cre."
https://openalex.org/W2050752342,"In this work we analyzed the photosynthetic apparatus in Arabidopsis thaliana plants acclimated to different light intensity and temperature conditions. Plants showed the ability to acclimate into different environments and avoid photoinhibition. When grown in high light, plants had a faster activation rate for energy dissipation (qE). This ability was correlated to higher accumulation levels of a specific photosystem II subunit, PsbS. The photosystem II antenna size was also regulated according to light exposure; smaller antenna size was observed in high light-acclimated plants with respect to low light plants. Different antenna polypeptides did not behave similarly, and Lhcb1, Lchb2, and Lhcb6 (CP24) are shown to undergo major levels of regulation, whereas Lhcb4 and Lhcb5 (CP29 and CP26) maintained their stoichiometry with respect to the reaction center in all growth conditions. The effect of acclimation on photosystem I antenna was different; in fact, the stoichiometry of any Lhca antenna proteins with respect to photosystem I core complex was not affected by growth conditions. Despite this stability in antenna stoichiometry, photosystem I light harvesting function was shown to be regulated through different mechanisms like the control of photosystem I to photosystem II ratio and the association or dissociation of Lhcb polypeptides to photosystem I.

Plants are exposed to an environment where light and temperature conditions are largely variable. Because they have no possibility of moving to a more favorable environment, plants have evolved several mechanisms of acclimation. Among all the parameters, light intensity has a major influence on plants life; it is a limiting growth factor at dusk or under dense canopy, but it can easily be in excess at midday or under full sun, thus leading to oxidative stress and photoinhibition (1Demmig-Adams B. Adams W.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 599-626Crossref Scopus (2081) Google Scholar, 2Barber J. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Low temperature is known to play a synergistic role with excess illumination by limiting electron transport and carbon fixation rates. In these conditions, even a weak light can exceed energy utilization rate and become photoinhibitory (3Huner N.P.A. Oquist G. Sarhan F. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 224-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Mechanisms of photo-protection can be classified according to the time scale of activation upon establishment of the stress. Illumination rapidly activates the dissipation of the excitation energy as heat, a process called nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) 2The abbreviations used are: NPQ, nonphotochemical quenching; α(β)-DM, n-dodecyl-α(β)-d-maltoside; Chl, chlorophyll; CP, chlorophyll protein; Lhca (b), light harvesting complex of photosystem I (II); LHCI (LHCII), antenna complex of photosystem I (II); PSI (II), photosystem I (II); RC, reaction center; ROS, reactive oxygen species;μE, microeinstein; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Rubisco, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; qP, photochemical quenching; VDE, violaxanthin de-epoxidase; Ctrl, control; LL, low light; HL, high light; cLL, cold low light; cHL, cold high light; ZE, zeaxanthin epoxidase.

Biol. 1999; 50: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). Its fastest component is called qE, and it is known to depend on the presence of the PSII subunit PsbS (6Li X.P. Bjorkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). NPQ also includes components activated on a slower time scale such as the synthesis of zeaxanthin from violaxanthin (7Niyogi K.K. Grossman A.R. Björkman O. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1121-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 8Demmig-Adams B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 1-24Crossref Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 9Dall'Osto L. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) with zeaxanthin also active in scavenging ROS (10Havaux M. Niyogi K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8762-8767Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). These mechanisms are effective in reducing light damage during fast changes in illumination. However, when excess light is experienced during long periods, plants activate other mechanisms of response, such as the modulation of the light harvesting apparatus and metabolic energy sinks. In fact, in high light, the stoichiometry of electron carriers and enzymes of the Calvin cycle increases (11Seeman R.J. Sharkey T.D. Wang J. Osmond B. Plant Physiol. 1987; 84: 796-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gray G.R. Savitch L.V. Ivanov A.G. Huner N. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Walters R.G. Horton P. Planta. 1994; 195: 248-256Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar), whereas the relative abundance of antenna proteins with respect to the reaction center complexes decreases (14Anderson J.M. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 15Melis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1058: 87-106Crossref Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Here we have extended previous works on the acclimation changes of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana upon growth in different light and temperature conditions. Functional analysis confirmed that plants were indeed acclimated as shown by the absence of PSII photoinhibition, the modulation of oxygen evolution, and the photochemical capacity in high light. Long term exposure to high light was also shown to induce the accumulation of PsbS and a correlated increase in the qE component of NPQ. Of particular interest is the regulation of the antenna system; the adaptation to different light and temperature conditions leads to extensive changes within the PSII antenna system. Each of the different Lhcb components is tuned in their relative amount with the exception of Lhcb4 and Lhcb5 whose stoichiometry with respect to RCII remained substantially constant. Lhcb6 is peculiar because it undergoes the highest level of modulation, being virtually absent in HL conditions. On the contrary, in PSI no changes were detected in the stoichiometry of any of the Lhca proteins with respect to the reaction center. This suggests that PSI-LHCI behaves as the reference complex with respect to which PSII-LHCII undergoes regulation to maintain chloroplast redox state and ensure photoprotection. Plant Growth and Light Temperature Treatments—A. thaliana plants (Columbia ecotype) were grown for 4 weeks at 100 μE, 19 °C, 90% humidity, and 8 h of daylight. Afterward, they were moved under different light and temperature conditions for an additional 3 weeks. The conditions used are the following: control, 21 °C, 100 μE; low light (LL), 21 °C, 25 μE; high light (HL), 21 °C, 1600 μE; cold low light (cLL), 10 °C, 25 μE; and cold high light (cHL), 10 °C, 600 μE. In all measurements only fully expanded mature leaves were used, and they belonged to the 4th to the 7th leaf pair depending on the time and condition. Chlorophyll Fluorescence and Photosynthetic Parameter Measurements—Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured at room temperature on intact leaves of acclimated plants with a PAM-101 fluorimeter with a saturating light at 4500 μE and actinic light at six different intensities as follows: 100, 360, 640, 1200, 1600, and 2000 μE. Before measurements, plants were dark-adapted for at least 30 min at room temperature. The same measurements were also performed with actinic light of 2000 μE but with an overnight dark adaptation. The parameters Fv/Fm, NPQ, and photochemical quenching (qP) were calculated as (Fm - Fo)/Fo,(Fm - Fm′)/Fm′, and (Fm′-F)/(Fm′-Fo) (16Demmig-Adams B. Adams W.W. Barker D.H. Logan B.A. Bowling D.R. Verhoeven A.S. Physiol. Plant. 1996; 98: 253-264Crossref Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Chloroplast Isolation and Purifications of PSI-LHCI and LHCI—Chloroplasts were isolated from adapted plants by homogenizing leaves in a solution with 0.1 m Tricine/KOH, pH 7.8, 0.4 m sorbitol, 0.5% powder milk. The chloroplasts were then isolated by precipitation at 1500 × g. PSI-LHCI complexes were purified from all plants with the method described previously (17Croce R. Zucchelli G. Garlaschi F.M. Bassi R. Jennings R.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8572-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 18Croce R. Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Spectroscopy and Pigment Analysis—The absorption spectra were recorded using an SLM-Aminco DK2000 spectrophotometer in 5 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 0.5 m sucrose, and 0.03% β-DM. HPLC analysis was performed according to Ref. 19Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar. Chlorophyll to carotenoid ratio and Chl a/b ratio were independently measured by fitting the spectrum of acetone extracts with the spectra of individual purified pigments (18Croce R. Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). CD spectra were measured at 10 °C on a Jasco 600 spectropolarimeter. Chloroplast fluorescence spectra at 77 K were measured with Varian Cary Eclipse and corrected for instrumental response. Samples were in glycerol 60% (v/v) and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Emission spectra were measured with a 475 nm excitation, whereas excitation spectra were measured with a 735 nm emission. Short Term High Light Stress—Leaves from acclimated plants were transferred in glass tubes in N2 atmosphere and illuminated with light at 1800 μE for 7, 15, and 30 min (20Dainese P. Marquardt J. Pineau B. Bassi R. Murata N. Research in Photosynthesis. Vol. I. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1992: 287-290Crossref Google Scholar). Pigment extraction with 80% acetone was then performed on leaf disks frozen in liquid nitrogen. SDS-PAGE Analysis and Coomassie Stain Quantification— PSI-LHCI complexes were analyzed with SDS-PAGE as described in Ref. 21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar but using a acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 75:1 and a total concentration of acrylamide + bisacrylamide of 4.5 and 15.5%, respectively, for the stacking and running gel, where 6 m urea was also incorporated (22Ballottari M. Govoni C. Caffarri S. Morosinotto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4659-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The staining for the densitometry was obtained with 0.05% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 25% isopropyl alcohol, 10% acetic acid to improve linearity of the stain with respect to protein amount (23Ball E.H. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The protein amount was evaluated after SDS-PAGE by quantifying the stain bound to each band by colorimetry. We acquired the gel image using Bio-Rad GS710 scanner, and the picture was then analyzed with Gel-Pro Analyzer© software, which quantifies the staining of the bands as integrated optical density on the area of the band. At least five repetitions of each sample were analyzed to achieve sufficient accuracy. For the evaluation of Rubisco content, leaf disks were cut, and Chl content was determined with high accuracy. Then the amount of Rubisco, on a Chl basis, was determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining after identification of the band of Rubisco large subunit by Western blotting. Immunoblot Assays and Western Blotting Quantifications— For the quantification of PsbS, VDE, ZE, Lhcb3–6, and CP47 in different acclimated plants, leaves were homogenized in liquid nitrogen with a solution with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol. The chlorophyll content was then quantified by absorption spectra. For each sample 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1, and 1.2 μg of chlorophylls have been loaded on SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot assays with antibodies against different polypeptides were performed as described previously (24Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). To avoid any deviation between different immunoblots, samples were compared only when loaded in the same gel. Deriphat PAGE Analysis—Nondenaturing Deriphat-PAGE was performed following the method described previously (25Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but using 3.5% (w/v) acrylamide (38:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in the stacking gel and in the resolving gel an acrylamide concentration gradient from 4.5 to 11.5% (w/v) stabilized by a glycerol gradient from 8 to 16%. Thylakoids concentrated at 1 mg/ml chlorophylls were solubilized with a final 0.8% β-DM, and 30 μg of chlorophylls were loaded. The gel images were then analyzed with Gel-Pro Analyzer©. The integrated optical density measured in each band was checked to linearly correlate to the chlorophyll amounts present in each complex. Tocopherol Quantification—Tocopherols were quantified as described previously (26Garcia-Plazaola J.I. Becerril J.M. Phytochem. Anal. 1999; 10: 307-313Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). After extraction with 100% methanol and separation by HPLC, tocopherol was detected with a fluorescence detector using an excitation wavelength at 295 nm and an emission wavelength was 340 nm. Tocopherol standards were obtained from Sigma. Arabidopsis Plants Acclimate to Different Light Conditions and Avoid Photoinhibition—In this work we analyzed the photosynthetic apparatus of Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown in different light and temperature conditions. Plants grown for 4 weeks at 21 °C and 100 μE have been treated for a further 3 weeks at different conditions. Two different light intensities were combined with two temperatures, yielding a total of five different treatments, including the control condition: low light, high light, cold low light, and cold high light (growth conditions are detailed under “Experimental Procedures”). PSII quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm) gives an indication of the functionality of PSII reaction centers; Fv/Fm is normally around 0.80, but when PSII is photo-inhibited this value decreases to 0.4 or less. We followed the PSII quantum efficiency, always measured in fully expanded mature leaves, during the light treatment as reported in Table 1. After the 1st week from the modification of light conditions, HL and cHL plants showed PSII photoinhibition, as evidenced by the reduction of Fv/Fm. In the following weeks, however, despite the prolongation of light treatment, plants recovered from photoinhibition (Table 1). At the moment of the harvesting, all plants showed the same PSII quantum efficiency, irrespective from growth conditions. Thus, after 3 weeks PSII reaction centers are not photo-inhibited in any treated plant, despite both HL and cHL conditions caused at first a photoinhibitory stress (Table 1). This behavior is consistent with the literature of the field that describes that an environmental perturbation first causes a stress response and later leads to a stable long term response defined acclimation (3Huner N.P.A. Oquist G. Sarhan F. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 224-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (810) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Photosynthetic parameters of Arabidopsis plants grown in different light conditions PSII quantum efficiency value (Fv/Fm) measured during the acclimation time, showing the initial photoinhibition and the successive recovery. Other fluorescence parameters reported are as follows: qE, the quenching relaxed after 100 s in the dark; and qI, the fraction of NPQ that is not relaxed after 19 min of darkness. Measurements were performed on plants at the end of the treatment with an actinic light of 2000 μE as in Fig. 1A.CtrlLLHLcLLcHLFv/Fm (after 1 week)0.86 ± 0.010.85 ± 0.020.76 ± 0.040.87 ± 0.010.76 ± 0.04Fv/Fm (after 2 weeks)0.85 ± 0.020.85 ± 0.010.82 ± 0.040.87 ± 0.020.82 ± 0.02Fv/Fm (after 3 weeks)0.86 ± 0.010.85 ± 0.010.84 ± 0.010.87 ± 0.010.84 ± 0.01qE (after 3 weeks)2.03 ± 0.092.00 ± 0.222.69 ± 0.122.11 ± 0.122.59 ± 0.25qI (after 3 weeks)0.83 ± 0.080.92 ± 0.030.20 ± 0.170.75 ± 0.120.12 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab Following treatment, plants exposed to low light conditions did not show an obvious phenotype apart from a slightly reduced growth at both temperatures. Plants grown in high light were also smaller and also showed accumulation of anthocyanins, especially at low temperature, probably the result of the stress perceived by these plants in the 1st week. In conclusion, because PSII is known to be a major photoinhibition target, the Fv/Fm values measured suggest that plants analyzed in this work are able to respond to the different light conditions when they are exposed to strong illumination for a long enough time. Plants Acclimated to High Light Increase Photosynthetic Electron Transport Rate—To confirm that our plants were indeed acclimated, we measured an additional photosynthetic parameter, qP. qP indicates the fraction of 1Chl a excited states, detected from their fluorescence emission, which is quenched by the activity of photochemical reactions (27Genty B. Briantais J.-M. Baker N.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 990: 87-92Crossref Scopus (7061) Google Scholar). The comparison of this parameter between the different plants thus gives an indication of their efficiency in using light for photochemistry (1Demmig-Adams B. Adams W.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 599-626Crossref Scopus (2081) Google Scholar, 4Van Kooten O. Snel J.F.H. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 25: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Photochemical quenching values were measured with different light intensities (100, 360, 640, 1200, 1600, and 2000 μE). After 21 min of illumination, qP is clearly higher in plants adapted to HL with respect to both LL and Ctrl. This difference increases with the intensity of actinic light employed in the following measurement: at 1200 μE, qP values are 0.7, 0.35, and 0.14, respectively for HL, Ctrl, and LL (all values are reported in the supplemental figures). Thus, the growth in stronger light stimulates the ability to use energy for photosynthesis, in agreement with previous reports (12Gray G.R. Savitch L.V. Ivanov A.G. Huner N. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 28Bailey S. Walters R.G. Jansson S. Horton P. Planta. 2001; 213: 794-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) confirming that plants analyzed activate an acclimative response. To verify that qP values measured were indeed because of an increase of Calvin cycle enzymes content, we quantified one of them, the Rubisco, in the leaves acclimated to different conditions. With respect to Ctrl and cLL plants, LL plants contained less Rubisco (60%) whereas in HL plants its content is increased by 250% (200% in cHL). Thus, the observed increase in photochemical efficiency in high light plants was correlated with the presence of a higher content of Calvin cycle enzymes that utilize NADPH and ATP produced from light reactions, as observed previously in acclimation studies (12Gray G.R. Savitch L.V. Ivanov A.G. Huner N. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 28Bailey S. Walters R.G. Jansson S. Horton P. Planta. 2001; 213: 794-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 29Hurry V.M. Malmberg G. Gardestrom P. Oquist G. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A further confirmation that plants analyzed are indeed acclimated comes from the analysis of oxygen evolution rates. Plants grown in high light showed a larger ability to evolve oxygen. In HL leaves it was around 2.5 times with respect to the control, but this activity reached four times the control in cHL plants, again consistent with previous data on Arabidopsis (28Bailey S. Walters R.G. Jansson S. Horton P. Planta. 2001; 213: 794-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 30Oquist G. Hurry V.M. Huner N. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We thus showed that the plants analyzed responded to different light conditions by modulating the size of their metabolic sinks, photosynthetic rates, and their ability to use light for photochemistry. All parameters analyzed are consistent with the present literature on acclimation. This deduction, together with the observed absence of PSII photoinhibition after 3 weeks of treatment, is a fundamental starting point for all the following analyses, because it demonstrates that we are observing the effects of acclimation to different light intensities rather than of photo-damage. High Light Acclimated Plants Respond More Promptly to Illumination—A third fluorescence parameter, the NPQ, was also measured in all plants. Its value gives an indication on the fraction of fluorescence quenched nonphotochemically as heat (4Van Kooten O. Snel J.F.H. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 25: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1A, NPQ kinetics measured with a 2000 μE illumination in differently acclimated plants are reported, showing a clearly distinct behavior; plants grown in high light are faster in their response, and NPQ reaches its maximum level within 6–7 min. In control and low light-grown plants, instead, NPQ amplitude continues to rise until the light was switched off after 21 min. These results are in agreement with previous reports of larger NPQ in HL acclimated plants with respect to control plants (31Demmig-Adams B. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 474-482Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 32Bailey S. Horton P. Walters R.G. Planta. 2004; 218: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This faster response can be estimated by calculating qE, the fastest component of NPQ; values reported in Table 1 indicate how this component is clearly larger in HL and cHL plants. These plants are not only faster in responding to illumination but also in relaxing quenching after the light is switched off. The quenching not relaxed after 19 min of dark (qI (4Van Kooten O. Snel J.F.H. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 25: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar)) is far lower in HL plants with respect to Ctrl and LL, as reported in Table 1. In this short dark period in fact, NPQ in HL plants almost relaxed to zero. When NPQ measurements were performed by using different intensities of actinic light, interesting differences were observed in their kinetics. In Fig. 1B, results obtained using the lowest light intensity (360 μE) are reported; the NPQ level continuously rises in plants adapted to LL, whereas it is saturated in a few minutes in cLL and control plants. In HL-adapted plants instead, NPQ is rapidly activated when plants are switched from dark to light but starts to decline after a few minutes, still under actinic light. This suggests that photochemical reactions, once activated, efficiently use absorbed light, whereas nonphotochemical quenching mechanisms are concomitantly inhibited. NPQ kinetics thus suggest that HL plants are able to respond quicker to illumination by activating mechanisms for the dissipation of energy as heat. The fastest component of NPQ, defined as qE, or feedback de-excitation, was shown to be dependent on the PSII subunit PsbS (6Li X.P. Bjorkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). To verify if the increased response rate of HL plants was because of a different accumulation of this subunit, we measured the relative PsbS content by immunoblot titration. Five different dilutions of thylakoid membranes, corresponding to 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1, and 1.2 μgof chlorophyll, were loaded in the same SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Fig. 2A shows the results of detection with the antibody against PsbS, whose signal was quantified by densitometry. To avoid saturation, signal linearity through different dilutions was checked in all samples. In Fig. 2B two examples of the possible layout of linearity check is shown; in the case of an LL sample, all points can be fitted with a straight line with good accuracy. In the case of an HL sample, where PsbS content is higher, the last point clearly reaches saturation and stands out of the linear fit. Data points falling out of linearity, as in this case, were discarded. The results of the quantification, shown in Fig. 2C, demonstrate that PsbS indeed accumulates in HL plants with respect to control. Instead, in LL plants, PsbS content is slightly reduced. It is interesting to mention that the cLL sample, where PsbS content is close to control, also showed very similar NPQ kinetics. The content in PsbS thus strongly correlates with observed overall NPQ kinetics and amplitude. In the same samples we also quantified with the same method a PSII core subunit, CP47. If PsbS content is normalized to RCII content, differences between samples are not drastically changed, and the only significant difference with the data shown is that the difference between LL and control is smaller. Carotenoid Biosynthesis Is Regulated during Acclimation— Fluorescence kinetic measurements reported above are a good tool for the evaluation of photosynthetic performances during short light exposure. Long term modifications of photosynthetic apparatus can also be analyzed from changes in the thylakoid pigment compositions. As reported in Table 2, plants grown in distinct conditions showed a difference in their Chl a/b ratio as follows: increased in HL plants (both at 21 and 4 °C) and decreased in LL plants, irrespective to temperature conditions. Because Chl b is specifically bound to antenna proteins (Lhc), this modification in Chl a/b ratio suggests different accumulation levels of these polypeptides: higher in LL plants and lower HL, as shown previously (13Walters R.G. Horton P. Planta. 1994; 195: 248-256Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28Bailey S. Walters R.G. Jansson S. Horton P. Planta. 2001; 213: 794-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 33Lichtenthaler H.K. Kuhn G. Prenzel U. Meier D. Physiol. Plant. 1982; 56: 183-188Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 34Leong T.-Y. Anderson J.M. Photosynth. Res. 1984; 5: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 35Maenpaa P. Andersson B. Z.

It is worth noting that the increase in carotenoids occurs in conditions with a lower antenna size, suggesting extra carotenoids can be found free in the membrane. Not all carotenoid species, however, were increased to the same level; on a Chl basis, in fact neoxanthin and β-carotene levels are essentially unaffected. Violaxanthin and lutein content instead undergoes a significant increase in HL conditions together with the accumulation of significant amounts of antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin. Despite the lutein increase, however, components of the β-β branch of carotenoid biosynthetic pathway (β-carotene, zeaxanthin, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin) account for the highest part of the increase in carotenoid content with respect to the β-ϵ branch.TABLE 2Pigment composition of plants treated with different conditions Leaf pigment compositions of plants treated with different light/temperature conditions are reported.

https://openalex.org/W2046623416,"Artemisinin and its derivatives are currently recommended as first-line antimalarials in regions where Plasmodium falciparum is resistant to traditional drugs. The cytotoxic activity of these endoperoxides toward rapidly dividing human carcinoma cells and cell lines has been reported, and it is hypothesized that activation of the endoperoxide bridge by an iron(II) species, to form C-centered radicals, is essential for cytotoxicity. The studies described here have utilized artemisinin derivatives, dihydroartemisinin, 10beta-(p-bromophenoxy)dihydroartemisinin, and 10beta-(p-fluorophenoxy)dihydroartemisinin, to determine the chemistry of endoperoxide bridge activation to reactive intermediates responsible for initiating cell death and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of cell death. These studies have demonstrated the selective cytotoxic activity of the endoperoxides toward leukemia cell lines (HL-60 and Jurkat) over quiescent peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Deoxy-10beta-(p-fluorophenoxy)dihydroartemisinin, which lacks the endoperoxide bridge, was 50- and 130-fold less active in HL-60 and Jurkat cells, respectively, confirming the importance of this functional group for cytotoxicity. We have shown that chemical activation is responsible for cytotoxicity by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis to monitor endoperoxide activation by measurement of a stable rearrangement product of endoperoxide-derived radicals, which was formed in sensitive HL-60 cells but not in insensitive peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In HL-60 cells the endoperoxides induce caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death characterized by concentration- and time-dependent mitochondrial membrane depolarization, activation of caspases-3 and -7, sub-G(0)/G(1) DNA formation, and attenuation by benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, a caspase inhibitor. Overall, these results indicate that endoperoxide-induced cell death is a consequence of activation of the endoperoxide bridge to radical species, which triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2044874730,"Destruxins are a class of insecticidal, anti-viral, and phytotoxic cyclic depsipeptides that are also studied for their toxicity to cancer cells. They are produced by various fungi, and a direct relationship has been established between Destruxin production and the virulence of the entomopathogen Metarhizium anisopliae. Aside from opening calcium channels, their in vivo mode of action during pathogenesis remains largely uncharacterized. To better understand the effects of a Destruxin, we looked at changes in gene expression following injection of Destruxin A into the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Microarray results revealed reduced expression of various antimicrobial peptides that play a major role in the humoral immune response of the fly. Flies co-injected with a non-lethal dose of Destruxin A and the normally innocuous Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, showed increased mortality and an accompanying increase in bacterial titers. Mortality due to sepsis was rescued through ectopic activation of components in the IMD pathway, one of two signal transduction pathways that are responsible for antimicrobial peptide induction.

Insects are the most diverse and prolific land animals, and a variety of pathogens have specialized to infect them. Unlike bacteria or viruses that usually need to be ingested, certain fungal species can directly breach the insect cuticle to cause disease. Fungi are the most commonly observed insect pathogens in nature, causing the largest percentage of deaths because of infection. As a result, methods of controlling insect populations using live fungal insecticides have attracted medical and agronomical interest (1Blanford S. Chan B.H. Jenkins N. Sim D. Turner R.J. Read A.F.

In some fungi, success in infecting a wide variety of insects can, at least in part, be attributed to secretion of virulence factors during pathogenesis. Destruxins were initially identified as toxic compounds secreted by Metarhizium and were later characterized as important virulence factors accelerating the deaths of infected insects (5Kodaira Y. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1961; 25: 261-262Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 6Kershaw M.J. Moorhouse E.R. Bateman R. Reynolds S.E. Charnley A.K. J. Invertebr.

Entomophaga. 1985; 30: 353-364Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Chemically, Destruxins are cyclic hexadepsipeptides composed of an α-hydroxy acid and five amino acid residues. Five natural analogues (labeled A–E) have been isolated (5Kodaira Y. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1961; 25: 261-262Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 9Suzuki A. Kuyama A. Kodaira Y. Tamura S. Agric. Biol.

These forms differ in the R-group of the hydroxyl acid residue and appear to have overlapping but different biological effects. Primarily, however, injection, ingestion, or topical application of a Destruxin on insects causes tetanic paralysis (11Samuels R.I. Reynolds S.E. Charnley A.K. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 90C: 403-412Google Scholar). Destruxin-induced membrane depolarization due to the opening of Ca2+ channels has been implicated as a cause of paralysis and death (11Samuels R.I. Reynolds S.E. Charnley A.K. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 90C: 403-412Google Scholar). Destruxin also causes signaling changes through the phosphorylative activation of certain proteins in lepidopteran and human cell lines. In addition, Destruxins cause morphological and cytoskeletal changes in insect plasmatocytes in vitro, and this adversely affects insect cellular immune responses, such as encapsulation and phagocytosis (12Vey A. Matha V. Dumas C. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 2002; 80: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Vilcinskas A. Matha V. Goetz P. J.

These could be indirect results of a calcium influx (15Dumas C. Matha V. Quiot J.M. Vey A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Endocrinol. 1996; 114: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Destruxins also show biological activities against non-insects. They are particularly toxic to mammalian leukemia cells and spleen lymphocytes and have demonstrated anti-proliferative activity on mouse neoplasms in vitro (16Pedras M.S. Irina Zaharia L. Ward D.E. Phytochemistry. 2002; 59: 579-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Destruxins A, B, and E have also been shown to have antiviral properties in insect and human cell lines (17Vey A. Quiot J.M. Vago C. C. R. Acad. Sci. Ser. 1985; 3: 229-234Google Scholar, 18Huxham I.M. Lackie A.M. McCorkindale N.J. J.

For example, Destruxin B has demonstrated a suppressive effect on hepatitis B surface antigen expression (20Chen H.C. Chou C.K. Sun C.M. Yeh S.F. Antiviral Res. 1997; 34: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Yeh S.F. Pan W. Ong G.T. Chiou A.J. Chuang C.C. Chiou S.H. Wu S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Aside from their ability to open calcium channels, the mechanisms by which Destruxins achieve their varied biological activities have not been studied in vivo. Therefore, we used Drosophila melanogaster as an insect model to characterize the range of functions affected by Destruxins. Among insects, Drosophila has the best characterized immune response, and because of similarities in key signaling pathways, has been an invaluable model for understanding innate immunity in humans. Flies have three active innate immune mechanisms for dealing with an invading microorganism. Proteolytic cascades triggered by microbial determinants lead to the formation of melanotic clots at the site of infection (22Soderhall K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). The toxic melanin along with encapsulating lamellocytes that circulate in the Drosophila hemolymph can neutralize many foreign microorganisms (23Braun A. Hoffmann J.A. Meister M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14337-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 24Rizki R.M. Rizki T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6154-6158Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Other hemocytes actively phagocytose invading pathogens (25Lanot R. Zachary D. Holder F. Meister M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 230: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 26Elrod-Erickson M. Mishra S. Schneider D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 781-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In addition, pathogenic determinants activate Drosophila pattern recognition receptors, which initiate signal transduction cascades that trigger a humoral immune response. This response is marked by the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: AMP, antimicrobial peptide; PGRP, peptidoglycan recognition proteins; DmIKKβ, D. melanogaster IκB kinase β-subunit; NF-κB, nuclear factorκB; IκB, inhibitor ofκB; GO, gene ontology; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; UAS, upstream activating sequence.2The abbreviations used are: AMP, antimicrobial peptide; PGRP, peptidoglycan recognition proteins; DmIKKβ, D. melanogaster IκB kinase β-subunit; NF-κB, nuclear factorκB; IκB, inhibitor ofκB; GO, gene ontology; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; UAS, upstream activating sequence. that have activity against the invading pathogen. Two key pathways, named Toll and IMD, have been identified that mediate AMP expression (27Hoffmann J.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, 28De Gregorio E.

The former involves the activation of the Toll receptor due to detection of primarily fungal or Gram-positive bacterial determinants by upstream pattern recognition receptors (30Gobert V. Gottar M.

Science. 2002; 297: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The activation of the Toll pathway leads to the phosphorylation of several adaptor proteins that culminate in the phosphorylation of Cactus, an IκB homologue in Drosophila (33Belvin M.P. Jin Y. Anderson K.V. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 34Bergmann A. Stein D. Geisler R. Hagenmaier S. Schmid B. Fernandez N. Schnell B. Nusslein-Volhard C. Mech.

Biol. 1996; 180: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This leads to degradation of Cactus, freeing the NF-κB proteins Dorsal and Dif to translocate to the nucleus. There they activate transcription of a variety of genes important for the immune response, including the antimicrobial peptide Drosomycin (36Lemaitre B. Meister M. Govind S. Georgel P. Steward R.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the IMD pathway, activation of the receptor peptidoglycan recognition protein LC (PGRP-LC) by Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan (38Choe K.M. Werner T. Stoven S. Hultmark D. Anderson K.V.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2461-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and finally the cleavage of the NF-κB-like protein Relish. Relish is responsible for the transcription of many proteins important for the immune response, including the antimicrobial peptide Diptericin (43Lemaitre B. Kromer-Metzger E. Michaut L. Nicolas E. Meister M. Georgel P. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9465-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 44Meister M. Lemaitre B. Hoffmann J.A. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Drosomycin and Diptericin are often used as target genes to assay for the activation of the Toll and IMD pathways, respectively. Flies mutant in both the IMD and Toll pathways are unable to produce any of the characterized AMPs and are highly susceptible to infection from normally innocuous bacteria or fungi (28De Gregorio E. Spellman P.T. Tzou P. Rubin G.M. Lemaitre B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2568-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 29Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2954) Google Scholar).Here we report evidence that Destruxin A suppresses the Drosophila humoral immune response. We used cDNA microarrays and quantitative PCR to examine the effect of Destruxin A on adult Drosophila gene expression. The data revealed a significant proportion of AMP genes were down-regulated, suggesting that Destruxin may be suppressing components of the Drosophila immune system. The data further showed Destruxin had the ability to lower the expression of AMPs even when an immune response had been activated by Gram-negative bacterial infection. Destruxin also increased susceptibility of the fly to bacterial infection. The susceptibility could be rescued by ectopic expression of components of the IMD pathway. This result suggests that Destruxin mediates the specific down-regulation of AMPs through targeting a Drosophila innate immune signaling pathway and is the first evidence of such a phenomenon in vivo. In the evolutionary arms race between insect and fungus, Destruxins may thus be playing a novel role in facilitating fungal survival through specific suppression of host immune response components.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSpotted Microarray Construction and Analysis—From previous Affymetrix chip-based microarray experiments and a survey of the literature, we selected 464 genes important for Drosophila immune responses. We used Primer3 software to design primers to amplify unique regions of the selected genes, generating fragments between 200–600 bp in length (specific primer sequences can be obtained upon request). Fragments were amplified from whole genomic DNA of wild-type, Oregon R strains of D. melanogaster in a 96-well format. The reaction mixture to produce each amplicon contained 50 ng of Drosophila genomic DNA, 1 μm forward primer, 1 μm reverse primer, 1× Titanium Taq (Invitrogen), and 0.5 mm dNTP. The following PCR protocol was used. An initial 95 °C denaturation step for 5 min followed by 20 cycles of 30 s of denaturation at 95 °C, 30 s of annealing at 60 °C, and 45 s of extension at 75 °C. PCR products were run on agarose gels to confirm amplification success and specificity.Printing, hybridization, and scanning of slides were performed with an Affymetrix 417 Arrayer and 418 Scanner at the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute Microarray Core facility located at the Center for Biosystems Research. PCR products were spotted in triplicate on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides with a mean spot diameter of 100 μm and a spot spacing of 375 μm. Following printing and cross-linking, slides were washed with 1% SDS to remove background, treated with blocking solution (0.2 m succinic anhydride, 0.05 m sodium borate, prepared in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone), and washed with 95 °C water and 95% ethanol. After drying, slides were kept in the dark at room temperature.For microarray experiments, RNA was extracted from a pooled sample of 20 flies with STAT-60 buffer, according to the manufacturer's protocols (Isotex Diagnostics). They were further purified using the Qiagen RNAeasy purification kit and directly labeled using the Cyscribe first strand labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's protocols. The raw scanned image files were analyzed using Spot-finder (TIGR), and data normalization, quality assurance and control, filtering, and clustering were performed using MIDAS (TIGR) and MS-Excel (45Saeed A.I. Sharov V. White J. Li J. Liang W. Bhagabati N. Braisted J. Klapa M. Currier T. Thiagarajan M. Sturn A. Snuffin M. Rezantsev A. Popov D. Ryltsov A. Kostukovich E. Borisovsky I. Liu Z. Vinsavich A. Trush V. Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 2003; 34: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). Standard deviation normalization and Lowess transformation was performed on the data using MIDAS software. Experiments were done in triplicate, and genes that had at least two readable spots were selected. A criteria of one standard deviation above or below the mean induction of all genes was used to select for up- or down-regulated genes. On normalized data, this represents the top (and bottom) 16% of all genes on the array. The genes were then classified according to available gene ontology classifications, and the major groups are presented in Fig. 1.Fly Stocks—OregonR flies were used as wild type. For ectopic expression of Toll and IMD pathway components, we used the transgenic c564-Gal4 line of flies that express Gal4 in various tissues throughout the fly, particularly in the lymph gland, fat body, salivary glands, imaginal discs, gut, and brain (46Harrison D.A. Binari R. Nahreini T.S. Gilman M. Perrimon N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2857-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The c564-Gal4 flies were crossed into transgenic flies expressing upstream activating sequence (UAS)-DmIKKβ (provided by K. V. Anderson); UAS-PGRP-SA (provided by J. Royet); UAS-Imd, UAS-Diptericin, and UAS-Drosomycin (provided by B. Lemaitre) to ectopically express these components in the fly.Bacterial Infection, Survival, and Proliferation Assay—Escherichia coli DH5α strains were grown up in LB medium overnight, resuspended in an equal volume of filter-sterilized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Approximately 0.5 μl of the bacteria was then injected into the abdomens of female adult flies using a pneumatic picopump PV820 (World Precision Instruments) apparatus. A solution of 86 μm Destruxin A (Sigma-Aldrich) in 1× PBS was used for Destruxin injection. For gene expression studies, RNA was extracted 4 h after injection. The experiment was repeated a minimum of three times.Each survival experiment was performed with at least 20 flies and repeated three times. The total number of flies in each treatment was assessed for survival periodically over a five-day period. The Kaplan-Meier statistical model was used to compare fly survival, and p values <0.05 were deemed significant.For the bacterial proliferation assay, ampicillin-resistant E. coli were used. Twenty-four hours post-injection, the flies were anesthetized, surface sterilized by dipping in 95% ethanol, and homogenized in 1 ml of LB medium containing 1% Triton X-100 and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The homogenized medium was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and 50 μl was plated on LB-Amp plates representing colony-forming units in 1/20 of a fly. Colonies were counted following an overnight incubation of the LB-Amp plates at 37 °C. The experiment was independently repeated 10 times for each treatment, and the error bars show standard deviation.Phagocytosis Assay—The assay was performed as described previously (26Elrod-Erickson M. Mishra S. Schneider D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 781-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Adult flies are injected in the abdomen with fluorescein-labeled E. coli particles (Molecular Probes). After 30 min, trypan blue is injected to quench extracellular fluorescence. If the hemocytes are able to take up the fluorescent particles, the fluorescence can be visualized through the cuticle on the dorsal side of the abdomen. In cells deficient for phagocytosis, the fluorescence of the particles remains outside the phagocyte and is quenched by the trypan dye. This results in reduced visualization of particles inside flies deficient in phagocytosis.Quantitative PCR—RNA was isolated using STAT-60 buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol (Isotex Diagnostics). The RNA was digested with RNase-free DNase and subjected to reverse transcription using Superscript II (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA was quantified using real time-PCR using LUX probes (Invitrogen) on an ABI 5700 real time-PCR system following the manufacturer's protocols. Gene expression was normalized using RP49 as an endogenous control. The data presented in this paper has been further normalized to set uninjected wild-type levels as the calibrator. The specific primers used can be obtained upon request. The experiments were repeated a minimum of three times and in some cases over five times.RESULTSDestruxin Injection Causes a Reduction in Expression of Some Antimicrobial Peptide Genes—To test the effect of non-lethal doses of Destruxin on Drosophila gene expression, we compared wild-type flies injected with 86 μm Destruxin A to flies injected with PBS using cDNA microarrays. The dose was determined experimentally as the highest dose that could be injected into the fly without causing significant difference in mortality compared with PBS-injected flies within five days (data not shown). The custom-made microarrays enabled the study of 464 Drosophila genes selected from an extensive literature survey of data collected by other groups through microarray experiments on genes predicted to be important for the immune response (28De Gregorio E. Spellman P.T. Tzou P. Rubin G.M. Lemaitre B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2568-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 47Irving P. Troxler L. Heuer T.S. Belvin M. Kopczynski C. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Hetru C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15119-15124Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated upon Destruxin injection were classified based on known gene ontology (GO) information (Table 1). MIAME (minimal information about a microarray experiment)-compliant raw data can be accessed from the NCBI GEO website (accession number GSE5767). Categories of genes for general metabolism were not affected by Destruxin. By contrast, 52% of all antibacterial humoral response genes (GO:0006961) on the array were down-regulated in Destruxin-injected flies (Table 1). This represents nearly 23% of all down-regulated genes on the microarray (Fig. 1B) and represents the largest category in the chart. In these microarray experiments, any observed change in gene expression is presumably because of the effect of Destruxin (signal) or noise in the microarray system compared with gene expression in the control. If it is all noise, using a one-standard-deviation criterion would result in ∼15% of genes down-regulated in any given gene ontology category on normalized microarray data assumed to follow a normal distribution of gene expression. This means that, of the 17 antibacterial humoral response genes represented on the microarray, we would expect to see 2.5 genes down-regulated by chance alone. However, we observed nine. A χ-square analysis with one degree of freedom shows that this observed value is significantly different from the expected 2.5, with a p value of 0.0343. In addition, none of the genes in this category were found to be induced upon Destruxin injection (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Thus, there is a statistically significant down-regulation of antibacterial humoral response genes.TABLE 1Genes affected upon Destruxin A injection The genes have been classified according to available gene ontology (GO) classification and have been separated into up-regulated and down-regulated categories. The total number of genes in each category is given next to the gene ontology number in the dark boxes, and the relative percentage of genes up- or down-regulated in each category is also provided. Open table in a new tab Similarly, 34% of genes having peptidoglycan receptor activity (GO:0004867) were down-regulated, representing 15% of all down-regulated genes (Fig. 1B). Only 5% of genes in this category were induced (Table 1). Proteolysis and peptidolysis genes (GO:0006508) represented the largest percentage of all up-regulated genes (Fig. 1A), but only 10% of all genes in this category were up-regulated (Table 1). Because 11% of these genes were down-regulated, there was no significant shift in either direction for this category (Table 1). Of note, most genes (nearly 85% of the genes on the array) were not affected by Destruxin injection, suggesting that the down-regulated antibacterial humoral genes represent a specific phenomenon and are not the result of general ill health brought about by Destruxin injection. Thus, compared with other categories, we observed the most significant and specific down-regulation of the antibacterial peptide response.To confirm that Destruxin caused down-regulation of antimicrobial peptide genes, quantitative real time-PCR was used to examine Diptericin, Cecropin, Attacin, and Metchnikowin expression (Fig. 2). In all cases, the injected flies had a significantly lower AMP production than PBS-injected flies within 4 h of injection (using a one-tailed Student's t test cutoff of p < 0.05), as predicted by the microarrays. Quantitative real time-PCR confirmed the suppressive effects of Destruxin on these AMPs in the absence of infection. We used the Gram-negative bacteria E. coli to determine whether Destruxins can also reduce AMP expression when the immune response has been activated. Co-injection of Destruxin A with the bacteria significantly reduced expression of Diptericin, Attacin, and Drosomycin in these immune-stimulated flies at 4 h as compared with injection with E. coli (Fig. 2). To address the question of whether Destruxin was inhibiting or merely delaying the expression of these AMPs, we also examined their expression at 8 and 24 h. For Drosomycin, Destruxin appears to suppress expression at the earlier time point but not at the later time points. Drosomycin expression typically peaks at 24 h after infection, and it is possible that the injected Destruxin is no longer effective at this later time point. Inhibition of Diptericin and Attacin expression by Destruxin was easier to interpret because of the relative transience in their expression. Inhibition by Destruxin also appeared to be specific to these three AMPs, as levels of some others, such as Cecropin, Drosocin, and Metchnikowin, induced by bacterial injection were not significantly affected by Destruxin.FIGURE 2Quantitative real time-PCR looking at the effect of Destruxin on specific antimicrobial peptides over time. Co-injecting Destruxin with E. coli causes a lowering of Drosomycin, Diptericin, and Attacin gene expression compared with E. coli-injected flies within 4 h of injection. Adult flies more than five days old were injected with PBS (solid gray), E. coli (solid black), 86 μm Destruxin (dashed gray), or E. coli + Destruxin (dashed black). RNA was isolated from pooled samples of 20 flies 4, 8, and 24 h after injection, and quantitative real time-PCR was done to examine gene expression. The data were normalized using Drosophila RP49 as an endogenous control, and the y-axis represents relative expression compared with uninjected transcript levels set as 1. The experiment was repeated at least three times and in some cases over five times. The error bars represent S.D. The error bars are only shown for the E. coli- and E. coli + Destruxin-injected flies. Statistically significant differences were assessed at all time points using an unpaired one-tailed Student's t test.

We tested whether mitogenic-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase isoform 4 (MAP4K4) causes the TNF-α-induced negative regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK-1/2), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) on the insulin signaling pathway governing glucose metabolism. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) to suppress the expression of MAP4K4 protein 85% in primary human skeletal muscle cells, we provide evidence that TNF-α-induced insulin resistance on glucose uptake was completely prevented. MAP4K4 silencing inhibited TNF-α-induced negative signaling inputs by preventing excessive JNK and ERK-1/2 phosphorylation, as well as IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. These results highlight the MAPK4K4/JNK/ERK/IRS module in the negative regulation of insulin signaling to glucose transport in response to TNF-α. Depletion of MAP4K4 also prevented TNF-α-induced insulin resistance on Akt and the Akt substrate 160 (AS160), providing evidence that appropriate insulin signaling inputs for glucose metabolism were rescued. Silencing of MAP2K1 and MAP2K4, signaling proteins downstream of MAP4K4, recapitulated the effect of MAP4K4 siRNA in TNF-α-treated cells. Thus, strategies to inhibit MAP4K4 may be efficacious in the prevention of TNF-α-induced inhibitory signals that cause skeletal muscle insulin resistance on glucose metabolism in humans. Moreover, in myotubes from insulin-resistant type II diabetic patients, siRNA against MAP4K4, MAP2K4, or MAP2K1 restored insulin action on glucose uptake to levels observed in healthy subjects. Collectively, our results demonstrate that MAP4K4 silencing prevents insulin resistance in human skeletal muscle and restores appropriate signaling inputs to enhance glucose uptake.

The molecular mechanism for TNF-α-induced insulin resistance may involve excessive phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK-1/2) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), concomitant with increased serine and reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). JNK is a widely recognized target in the TNF-α-induced negative regulation of insulin signaling to metabolic endpoints. Thus, suppressors of JNK signaling may enhance insulin action and prevent defects in glucose metabolism after TNF-α stimulation. JNK is activated via a newly discovered protein named mitogenic-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase isoform 4 (MAP4K4) after treatment of cells with TNF-α (12Yao Z. Zhou G. Wang X.S.

MAP4K4 appears to play a role in TNF-α-induced insulin resistance. For example, deletion of MAP4K4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes restores GLUT4 trafficking after TNF-α stimulation (13Tang X. Guilherme A. Chakladar A. Powelka A.M. Konda S. Virbasius J.V. Nicoloro S.M. Straubhaar J. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We explored the role of MAP4K4 as intermediate kinase for TNF-α action on glucose uptake in human skeletal muscle cells and tested the hypothesis that MAP4K4 is involved in JNK and ERK-1/2 activation to modulate insulin sensitivity. Using siRNA to suppress the expression of MAP4K4, we show that TNF-α-induced insulin resistance on signal transduction at the level of Akt and the Akt substrate 160 (AS160), as well as glucose uptake, are prevented. Moreover, we provide evidence that MAP4K4 silencing prevents TNF-α-induced JNK and ERK-1/2 phosphorylation, as well as IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. Silencing MAP2K1 and MAP2K4, intermediary kinases involved in ERK and JNK signaling, respectively, recapitulated the effect of MAP4K4 silencing in TNF-α-treated cells. Thus, strategies to inhibit MAP4K4 are efficacious in the prevention of TNF-α-induced inhibitory signals that cause insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Finally, we also provide evidence that MAP4K4 silencing in skeletal muscle cells from type II diabetic patients restores insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Antibodies and Reagent—Antibodies against MAP4K4 was from Abgent (San Diego, CA). Akt (Ser-473), Akt, and ERK-1/2 (p42/44 MAPK) kinase (Thr-202 and Tyr-204) were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt substrate, MAP2K1, MAP2K4, anti-phospho-IRS-1 (Ser-312), and IRS-1 (Ser-636, Ser-639) antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Radiochemical 2-[G-3H]deoxy-d-glucose (6.0 Ci mmol–1 × liter–1) was from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). siRNA primers were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), Ham’s F-10 medium, fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone were obtained from Invitrogen (Invitrogen, Stockholm, Sweden). Unless otherwise stated, all other reagents were from Sigma. Radioactive reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Subject Characteristics—Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained with the informed consent of the donors either during scheduled abdominal surgery (rectus abdominus) or during an open biopsy (vastus lateralis) from 10 healthy control subjects (six males, four females; aged 52 ± 4 years; body mass index of 25.4 ± 1.8 kg × m–2 and fasting blood glucose of 5.3 ± 0.5 mm) and five type II diabetic patients (five males; aged 54 ± 4 years; body mass index of 27.8 ± 1.1 kg × m–2 and fasting blood glucose of 6.8 ± 0.2 mm). The study was approved by the local ethical committee. Cell Culture and Differentiation—Human skeletal muscle cells were isolated from biopsies by trypsin digestion and grown to confluent myoblasts and differentiated into myotubes, as described previously in detail (20Bouzakri K. Roques M. Gual P. Espinosa S. Guebre-Egziabher F. Riou J.P. Laville M. March Le -Brustel Y. Tanti J.F. Vidal H. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Briefly, muscle from each subject was minced before being incubated for 30 min in 5 ml of trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) at 37 °C under agitation. After centrifugation (150 × g), the pellet was rinsed several times in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were first preplated for 1 h to rapidly eliminate adherent fibroblasts. The remaining cells were then cultured in a growth medium composed of Ham’s F-10 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics (Invitrogen). Cells were plated in 6-well plates and cultured in growth medium at 37 °C until confluence. The differentiation into myotubes was induced by changing the medium to DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics. Most cells showed a polynucleated status and expressed specific markers of human skeletal muscle 4 days after differentiation was initiated (20Bouzakri K. Roques M. Gual P. Espinosa S. Guebre-Egziabher F. Riou J.P. Laville M. March Le -Brustel Y. Tanti J.F. Vidal H. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). siRNA Design—Two constructs of siRNA oligonucleotides specifically targeting MAP4K4, MAP2K1, and MAP2K4 were designed with 3′-overhanging thymidine dimers following the described procedures (21Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). Target sequences were aligned to the human genome data base in a BLAST search to eliminate sequences with significant homology to other genes. siRNA Transfection in Myotubes—Myotubes were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Differentiation medium were changed to antibiotic-free growth medium on day 2 of myotube differentiation. On day 3, individual siRNAs (1 μg/ml) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 in serum-free DMEM (incubating time >16 h). Myotubes were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and DMEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum was added in each well. On day 6, cells were deprived of serum for 16 h before insulin stimulation. Control cultures were similarly prepared but without the addition of siRNA (control) or transfected using a scrambled primer (siRNA Scr). The scrambled construct was similar to the target sequence (same GC content) encoding a nonspecific siRNA without mammalian homology. Different scrambled constructs were tested for each experiment to assure the silencing specificity. Western Blot Analysis—Aliquots of cell lysate (20 μg of protein) were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), blocked with 7.5% nonfat milk, washed with TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20), and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with an appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified by densitometry. 2-Deoxyglucose Transport—Glucose uptake was performed as described previously for primary human muscle cells (22Bouzakri K. Roques M. Debard C. Berbe V. Rieusset J. Laville M. Vidal H. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 1314-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) Production—IL-6 was measured from cell culture supernatants after different duration of TNF-α stimulation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the IL-6 human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems Europe Ltd., Oxon, UK). Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical differences were determined by Students t test or analysis of variance using Fisher’s least significant difference test for post hoc determination. Effect of TNF-α on IL-6 Release—IL-6 release from human skeletal muscle cells was determined after different time periods of TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 1). During the first 8 h of TNF-α stimulation, IL-6 release was not significantly different from basal. After 12 and 24 h, significant IL-6 release was observed. To avoid any potential effect of IL-6 on signaling and metabolic parameters, experiments were conducted after 2 h of TNF-α stimulation. MAP4K4 Silencing in Myotubes—The effect of MAP4K4 gene silencing on target protein expression was determined in differentiated myotubes. Two days after induction of the myotube differentiation program, cells were transfected with siRNA against MAP4K4. MAP4K4 protein expression was reduced 85% compared either untransfected cells or cells transfected with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 2). Myotube morphology was unaltered after MAP4K4 silencing (data not shown). MAP4K4 Gene Silencing Directly Prevents TNF-α-induced Impairment in Glucose Metabolism—The role of MAP4K4 on glucose uptake was determined in differentiated myotubes. Four days after transfection, glucose uptake was assessed under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions before or after 2 h TNF-α treatment. In control or transfected cells with scrambled siRNA, insulin increased glucose uptake 1.7-fold (Fig. 3). Basal glucose transport was unaltered in cells exposed to TNF-α. In contrast, TNF-α treatment completely blocked insulin action on glucose uptake. Silencing of MAP4K4 was without effect on either basal or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Importantly, TNF-α-induced insulin-resistant on glucose uptake was rescued by MAP4K4 silencing. We next tested the hypothesis that treatment of cells with siRNA causes release of factor(s), which are in turn responsible for the observed changes in the TNFα effect. Control cells were treated with conditioned medium from transfected cells as described in the legend for Fig. 3. In control cells treated with conditioned media from cells where MAP4K4 was silenced, insulin action on glucose uptake tended to be reduced, although this effect was not statistically significant (Fig. 4). Moreover, TNF-α-induced insulin resistance was not rescued by conditioned media from siMAP4K4 transfected cells (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Glucose uptake after pretreatment with conditioned medium. Glucose uptake was measured on differentiated primary human skeletal muscle myotubes under basal conditions (open box) and after insulin-stimulation (closed box). Cells were pretreated for 4 days with conditioned medium that were obtained from cells as described in the legend for Fig. 3. Data are mean ± S.E. *, p < 0.05 versus basal untransfected control, #, p < 0.05 versus insulin-stimulated untransfected control, n = 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MAP4K4 Silencing Prevents TNF-α Action on JNK and ERK-1/2—The role of MAP4K4 in TNF-α-induced JNK and ERK-1/2 signaling was assessed as these targets are implicated in the negative regulation of the insulin signaling cascade to glucose uptake. Insulin increased JNK and ERK-1/2 phosphorylation in control and cells transfected with scrambled siRNA. TNF-α increased basal JNK and ERK-1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5). MAP4K4 silencing reduced basal and abolished insulin-stimulated JNK and ERK-1/2 phosphorylation. Similar effects were observed in MAP4K4-depleted cells exposed to TNF-α. MAP4K4 silencing prevented TNF-α-induced JNK and ERK phosphorylation. Protein expression of JNK and ERK-1/2 was unaltered in cells depleted of MAP4K4. Thus, JNK and ERK-1/2 signaling, but not protein expression, are linked to MAP4K4 actions. MAP4K4 Silencing Prevents TNF-α-induced IRS-1 Serine Phosphorylation—Elevated levels of TNF-α and excessive JNK and ERK phosphorylation are correlated with increased IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and negative regulation insulin signaling pathways important for glucose metabolism. We next determined whether MAP4K4 gene silencing prevents TNF-α-induced IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. TNF-α increased basal IRS-1 serine phosphorylation on residues 312 and 636/639 (Fig. 6). Depletion of MAP4K4 prevented TNF-α action on basal IRS-1 serine phosphorylation on residues 312 and 636/639. Thus, MAP4K4 is required for TNF-α effects on basal IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. Interestingly, insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 at 636/639, but not 312, was prevented in MAP4K4-depleted cells. This MAP4K4 dependence on insulin-stimulated IRS-1 Ser-636/-639 phosphorylation was also noted for JNK and ERK1/2. In TNF-α-treated cells, depletion of MAP4K4 restored insulin action on IRS-1 Ser-636/-639 phosphorylation when compared with cells transfected with scrambled siRNA. Total protein expression of IRS-1 was unaltered after MAP4K4 silencing, indicating that the observed effects were on changes in phosphorylation rather than protein expression. TNF-α-induced Insulin Resistance on Akt and AS160 Is Prevented by MAP4K4 Silencing—Insulin increased phosphorylation of Akt Ser-473 and AS160 in control or transfected cells with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 7). Although TNF-α treatment did not alter basal Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation, basal AS160 phosphorylation was increased ∼2-fold. Importantly, TNF-α completely prevented insulin action on Akt Ser-473 and AS160. MAP4K4 suppression increased basal Akt Ser-473 and AS160 phosphorylation. In contrast, under insulin-stimulated conditions, Akt and AS160 phosphorylation was unaltered in cells depleted of MAP4K4 when compared with control or cells transfected with scrambled siRNA. Depletion of MAP4K4 prevented TNF-α-induced insulin resistance on Akt Ser-473 and AS160. Protein expression of Akt and AS160 was unaltered between all conditions studied (Fig. 7); emphasizing the effects of TNF-α to induce insulin resistance under this 2-h protocol involved changes in protein phosphorylation rather than protein expression. Likewise, the effect of MAP4K4 silencing to protect against TNF-α-induced insulin resistance-involved changes in phosphorylation rather than expression of Akt and AS160. Silencing of MAPK Signaling Proteins Downstream of MAP4K4 Recapitulated the Effect of MAP4K4 Silencing in TNF-α-treated Cells—Our results provide evidence to suggest that MAP4K4 plays an important role in TNF-α-mediated activation of ERK and JNK and serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in human skeletal muscle. To definitively prove that this is the mechanism through which MAP4K4 mediates insulin resistance with respect to glucose transport, we blocked the MAPK pathway downstream of MAP4K4 by silencing MAP2K1 and MAP2K4. MAP2K1 and MAP2K4 protein expression was reduced 75 and 80%, respectively (Fig. 8). Basal and insulin-mediated glucose uptake was determined in myotubes after MAP2K1 or MAP2K4 silencing (Fig. 9). In cells where MAP2K1 or MAP2K4 was suppressed, basal and insulin-stimulated glucose was unaltered when compared with non-transfected cells. In cells pretreated with TNF-α, insulin action on glucose was partially restored in cells where MAP2K1 or MAP2K4 was suppressed. In cells where both MAP2K1 and MAP2K4 were silenced, TNF-α-induced insulin resistance was prevented.FIGURE 9Effect of MAP2K1 and/or MAP2K4 siRNA on glucose uptake. Glucose uptake was measured on differentiated primary human skeletal muscle myotubes under basal conditions (open box) and after insulin stimulation (closed box). Measurements were performed after silencing of MAP2K1 and/or MAP2K4.

Insulin-mediated glucose uptake was markedly impaired in myotubes from type II diabetic patients versus healthy control subjects (Fig. 11). MAP4K4 siRNA restored insulin action on glucose uptake in myotubes from type II diabetic patients to levels observed in healthy subjects. Silencing of MAP2K1 increased basal glucose uptake and restored insulin action in myotubes from type II diabetic patients. Depletion of either MAP2K4 or MAP2K1 and MAP2K4 in myotubes from type II diabetic patients was without effect on basal glucose uptake and completely restored insulin action.FIGURE 11Effect of MAP2K1, MAP2K4, and MAP4K4 siRNA on glucose uptake in myotubes from type II diabetic patients. Glucose uptake was measured on differentiated primary human skeletal muscle myotubes from type II diabetic patients under basal conditions (open box) and after insulin stimulation (closed box). Measurements were performed after silencing of MAP4K4, MAP2K1, and/or MAP2K4.

In the present study, we explored the mechanism by which TNF-α induces insulin resistance in skeletal muscle using siRNA. We considered MAP4K4 as a TNF-α target based on earlier work in 3T3-L1 adipocytes where siRNA against MAP4K4 enhances GLUT4 expression and insulin-stimulated glucose transport, concomitant with up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPα) expression (13Tang X.

MAP4K4 belongs to the Sterile 20 group of protein kinases and is a putative effector of Rap2, a Ras family small GTP-binding proteins that mediates the activation of JNK (19Machida N. Umikawa M.

After osteopontin treatment, MAP4K4 has been shown to phosphorylate JNK through activation of MEKK1 (19Machida N. Umikawa M. Takei K. Sakima N. Myagmar B.E. Taira K. Uezato H. Ogawa Y. Kariya K. J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 19381-19392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The role of MAP4K4 in ERK-1/2 activation has been challenged to resolve because MAP4K4 does not seem to interact with upstream proteins shown to be important for ERK-1/2 activation (19Machida N. Umikawa M. Takei K. Sakima N. Myagmar B.E. Taira K. Uezato H. Ogawa Y. Kariya K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15711-15714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, human tumor cells expressing an inactive mutated form of MAP4K4 and treated with hepatocyte growth factor resulted in a decrease in ERK-1/2 phosphorylation (24Wright J.H. Wang X. Manning G. LaMere B.J. Le P. Zhu S. Khatry D. Flanagan P.M. Buckley S.D. Whyte D.B. Howlett A.R. Bischoff J.R. Lipson K.E. Jallal B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2068-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Here we report that MAP4K4 is required for insulin, as well as TNF-α action on JNK and ERK-1/2 phosphorylation in primary human skeletal muscle cells. MAP4K4 silencing (85%) prevented insulin, as well as TNF-α action on ERK-1/2 and JNK, without altering total protein levels. Protein kinases including TAK1, MAP2K4, MAP2K1, and MKK7 acting between MAP4K4, ERK-1/2, and JNK are necessary for activation of this pathway (23Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). However, these intermediate kinases are not necessarily common in the ERK-1/2 and JNK activating pathways. When either MAP2K4 or MAP2K1 was silenced, TNF-α-mediated insulin resistance was prevented, as observed for MAP4K4. Thus, we show for the first time that MAP4K4 is a common upstream kinase linking ERK-1/2 and JNK signaling pathways in human skeletal muscle cells in response to insulin or TNF-α treatment. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, TNF-α stimulation increases MAP4K4 expression, thereby promoting insulin resistance, probably due to cross-talk action with PPARγ signaling (13Tang X. Guilherme A. Chakladar A. Powelka A.M. Konda S. Virbasius J.V. Nicoloro S.M. Straubhaar J. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, in adipocytes, MAP4K4 appears to contribute to the regulation of glucose metabolism as a suppressor of PPARγ and adipogenesis. We explored the role of MAP4K4 on insulin signaling and acute TNF-α action on metabolic endpoints in human skeletal muscle. Our previous work in healthy human volunteers provides evidence that TNF-α infusion increases skeletal muscle ERK-1/2 and JNK phosphorylation, concomitant with IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and negative regulation of insulin action on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, AS160, and glucose uptake (11Plomgaard P. Bouzakri K. Krogh-Madsen R. Mittendorfer B. Zierath J.R. Pedersen B.K. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2939-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 20Bouzakri K. Roques M. Gual P. Espinosa S.

We therefore tested the hypothesis that MAP4K4 silencing enhances insulin signaling in TNF-α-treated human skeletal muscle cells. Suppression of MAP4K4 was without effect on basal IRS-1 serine phosphorylation at Ser-636/-639 or -312. However, insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 at 636/639, but not 312, was abolished in MAP4K4-depleted cells. This MAP4K4 dependence on insulin-stimulated IRS-1 Ser-636/-639 phosphorylation was also noted for JNK and ERK1/2. These data provide evidence for a previously unrecognized role of MAP4K4 in IRS action to JNK and ERK signaling modules. The TNF-α-induced increase in phosphorylation of IRS1 at Ser-636/-639 and Ser-312 was completely prevented by MAP4K4 silencing. Thus, TNF-α induces MAP4K4-dependent ERK-1/2, JNK, and IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, eliciting negative signaling input downstream of IRS-1 to impair insulin action on glucose uptake and metabolism in skeletal muscle. Indeed, suppression of MAP4K4 prevented TNF-α-induced insulin resistance on phosphorylation of Akt and AS160. This provides a mechanism for the enhanced insulin-mediated glucose uptake as signal transduction via Akt and AS160 are important for insulin action on glucose uptake and metabolism (25Eguez L.

Our data show that targeted deletion of MAP4K4, an early component of the TNF-α signaling pathway, can enhance insulin signaling and prevent skeletal muscle insulin resistance. The mechanism responsible for the development of insulin resistance in humans remains unclear. However, defects in insulin signaling and glucose metabolism, as evidenced by excessive serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and impairments in insulin-mediated glucose uptake, have been observed in cultured skeletal muscle cells from type II diabetic patients, indicating that features of the insulin-resistant state are maintained (20Bouzakri K. Roques M. Gual P. Espinosa S. Guebre-Egziabher F. Riou J.P. Laville M. March Le -Brustel Y. Tanti J.F. Vidal H. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We determined the role of MAP4K4, as well as other kinases involved in MAPK signaling on insulin action, and tested the hypothesis that silencing of MAP4K4 could reverse insulin resistance in human skeletal muscle cells from type II diabetic patients. MAP4K4 silencing restored insulin action on glucose uptake in myotubes from type II diabetic patients. To confirm whether MAP4K4 is involved in MAPK signaling pathway activation, we also silenced MAP2K1 and MAP2K4, downstream targets of MAP4K4. Silencing of either MAP2K1 or MAP2K4 recapitulated the effect of MAP4K4 silencing to restore insulin-mediate glucose uptake. In summary, we have identified MAP4K4 as a potential therapeutic target to prevent peripheral insulin resistance. MAP4K4 silencing protects against TNF-α-mediated insulin resistance in myotubes from healthy subjects. Moreover, MAP4K4 silencing restores insulin action in myotubes from insulin-resistant type II diabetic patients. We propose a model where excessive TNF-α levels activate a negative feedback loop on insulin signaling to glucose uptake and metabolism via MAP4K4 (Fig. 12), which couples ERK-1/2 and JNK signaling pathways to IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that MAP4K4 silencing prevents TNF-α-mediated insulin resistance in human skeletal muscle and restores appropriate signaling inputs to enhance glucose uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1964292121,"Wilson and Menkes diseases are genetic disorders of copper metabolism caused by mutations in the Wilson (WND) and Menkes (MNK) copper-transporting P1B-type ATPases. The N termini of these ATPases consist of six metal binding domains (MBDs). The MBDs interact with the copper chaperone Atox1 and are believed to play roles in catalysis and in copper-mediated cellular relocalization of WND and MNK. Although all six MBDs have similar folds and bind one Cu(I) ion via a conserved CXXC motif, biochemical and genetic data suggest that they have distinct functions. Most studies aimed at characterizing the MBDs have employed smaller polypeptides consisting of one or two domains. The role of each MBD is probably defined by its environment within the six-domain N terminus, however. To study the properties of the individual domains within the context of the intact Wilson N terminus (N-WND), a series of variants in which five of the six metal binding CXXC motifs are mutated to SXXS was generated. For each variant, the Cu(I) binding affinity and the ability to exchange Cu(I) with Atox1 were investigated. The results indicate that Atox1 can deliver Cu(I) to and remove Cu(I) from each MBD, that each MBD has stronger Cu(I) retention properties than Atox1, and that all of the MBDs as well as Atox1 have similar KCu values of (2.2–6.3) × 1010 m–1. Therefore, the specific role of each MBD is not conferred by its position within the intact N-WND but may be related to interactions with other domains and partner proteins.

According to yeast two-hybrid assays using both WND and MNK, MBD1–4 interact most strongly with Atox1, whereas no interaction is observed with domains 5 and 6 (20Larin D. Mekios C. Das K. Ross B.

Cysteine labeling experiments further suggest that Atox1 preferentially delivers copper to WND domain 2 (30Walker J.M. Huster D. Ralle M. Morgan C.T. Blackburn N.J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15376-15384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and NMR chemical shift titrations indicate that Atox1 can interact with both MBD2 and MBD4 (7Achila D.

Although it has been proposed that domain 4 transfers copper delivered by Atox1 to domains 5 and 6, which then shuttle it to the intramembrane CPC site (7Achila D. Banci L. Bertini I. Bunce J.

Copper binding to the WND MBDs also modulates an interdomain interaction with the ATPBD. In the absence of copper, the six MBDs interact with the ATPBD, reducing its affinity for ATP (31Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol.

In addition to interacting with Atox1 and the ATPBD, the MBDs are believed to affect both catalysis and the cellular localization of WND and MNK. At elevated copper concentrations, WND and MNK relocalize from the trans-Golgi network to cytoplasmic vesicles (32Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

For both MNK and WND, relocalization is coordinated with catalysis in that copper binding induces acyl phosphate formation as well as trafficking to the membrane (34Petris M.J. Voskoboinik I. Cater M. Smith K. Kim B.-E. Llanos R.M. Strausak D. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F.B. J. Biol.

Mutagenesis studies on both WND and MNK suggest that either domain 5 or domain 6 is sufficient both for relocalization and for copper transport activity (36Huster D. Lutsenko S. J. Biol.

Notably, recent studies of WND suggest that copper binding by neither the MBDs nor the intramembrane CPC motif is required for acyl phosphate formation and relocalization, raising the possibility of additional copper binding sites (35Cater M.A. LaFontaine S. Mercer J.F.B. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Collectively, the biochemical and genetic data suggest that WND MBD1–4 are important for interaction with Atox1 and that MBD5 and MBD6 are responsible for copper transport and copper-induced relocalization. The properties that confer distinct functions on the individual domains have not been elucidated; nor has the reason for the presence of six MBDs in the human proteins. The domains structurally characterized thus far are quite similar, although the electrostatic surfaces exhibit some variation (30Walker J.M. Huster D. Ralle M. Morgan C.T. Blackburn N.J. Lutsenko S.

Several attempts have been made to determine the copper binding affinities of the individual domains and to characterize their interactions with Atox1, but in all of these studies, smaller polypeptides consisting of one or two MBDs were employed (7Achila D.

It is likely that the role of each MBD is dependent on and defined by its environment within the entire six-domain N terminus (N-WND). To probe the properties of the MBDs within the context of the intact N-WND, we generated a series of variants in which five of the six metal-binding CXXC motifs were mutated to SXXS as well as a variant lacking all CXXC sequences (Fig. 1). These proteins were then used to measure the copper binding affinities of each MBD and their ability to exchange Cu(I) with Atox1. Construction of Template for Site-directed Mutagenesis— The DNA sequence coding for the WND N-terminal MBDs was amplified from a plasmid containing the cDNA for the entire WND (supplied by Dr. Jonathan Gitlin, Washington University School of Medicine; GenBank™ accession number NM_000053) by PCR. Both forward and reverse primers, WND-f and WND-rev, were designed to include ligation-independent cloning (LIC) ends (Table S1). The pUC19 plasmid was linearized by PCR using the pUC19-f and pUC19-rev primers, which also include LIC ends (Table S1). The two PCR products were then annealed using the LIC method (Novagen). The correct sequence for the MBDs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Three mutations relative to the GenBank™ accession number NM_000053 sequence were detected in the amplified WND sequence: A449 → G (Asp → Gly), T1378 → G (Ser → Ala), and G1528 → C (Val → Leu). The first mutation is also present in the human genome. The other mutations are present in genes related to NM_000053. In the sequence L25591 (nucleotides 607–2061), one nucleotide is missing at position 1528. In the sequence U03464 (nucleotides 163–2061), the following mutations are present as compared with NM_000053: G171 → A, A449 → G, G1033 → C, T1378 → G, and G1528 → C. By contrast, the sequence U11700 (nucleotides 163–2061) matches NM_000053 perfectly. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The QuikChange method (Stratagene) was used to replace the metal-binding cysteine residues in the MBDs with serines. In general, the template to be mutated was amplified by PCR using two sets of gene-specific primers (Table S1) that overlapped the intended mutation sites. In the WND MBDs, cysteine is encoded by either TGC or TGT, and serine can be encoded with AGC or TCT. Therefore, each overlapped primer introduced two point mutations that resulted in the conversion of the CXXC motif to SXXS. The mutant genes were gel-purified and transformed into Nova Blue competent cells, and the DNA was isolated, sequenced, and used for the next round of mutations. The CXXC motifs in domains 1–4 were mutated to SXXS sequentially, yielding a construct with only domains 5 and 6 having intact metal-binding motifs. Subsequently, mutation of the CXXC motifs in domain 5, domain 6, or both domains 5 and 6 resulted in the constructs denoted MBD6, MBD5, and MBD0, respectively. The number in the mutant name refers to the domain with an intact CXXC motif. In all further steps, MBD0 was used as the template. By reversing the mutations (changing from SXXSto CXXC) in domains 1, 2, 3, and 4 individually using the primers shown in Table S1, the constructs MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, and MBD4 were generated. MBD Expression and Purification—The mutants were initially cloned into the pET30Xa/LIC system using the WND-f and WND-rev primers (Table S1), sequenced, and transformed into Rosetta(DE3)pLysS cells. The proteins were overexpressed but accumulated in inclusion bodies under all experimental conditions. Switching to the pET32Xa/LIC system, which includes an additional thioredoxin tag, dramatically increased protein solubility. All variants were expressed at similar levels to the wild-type N-WND. Protein expression was induced at 18 °C with 0.9 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an optical density of 0.7–1.0 at 600 nm. Cells were harvested after an overnight growth, resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and stored at –80 °C. For purification, the cell suspension was thawed and stirred at ambient temperature for 30–60 min with EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science; 1 tablet for 40 ml of cell suspension) and a pinch of solid DNase I. The solution was centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was applied to a 20-ml preequilibrated nickel-loaded chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), rinsed with buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol), and eluted with an eight-column volume gradient of 300 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl. MBD-containing fractions were collected and dialyzed twice at 4 °C versus 2 liters of buffer H (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl). The protein solution was then concentrated to 50 ml (∼40 μm), and cleavage of affinity tags was initiated by the addition of 120 units of Factor Xa (Novagen) in buffer H supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2. After 7–8 h, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride was added to stop the proteolytic cleavage. Cleavage reactions were reloaded onto the nickel column, rinsed with buffer A, and eluted with ∼24–36 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the cleaved protein were concentrated with a Centriprep 10 (Amicon) to 5 ml in the presence of 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, and 50 μm bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS), applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol. Rapid purification at 4 °C was critical to minimizing proteolysis. The typical yield was ∼6–16 mg of pure protein (supplemental Fig. S1) per liter of Escherichia coli culture. Atox1 Expression and Purification—BL21(DE3) cells containing pET21b with the gene encoding Atox1 (42Wernimont A.K. Yatsunyk L.A. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12269-12276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) were grown at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.8–1.1, and then protein expression was induced with 0.9 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 3 h, the cells were harvested, resuspended in 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride, and stored at –80 °C. For purification, the cell suspension was thawed with 5 mm DTT and protease inhibitor tablets (Amersham Biosciences; 1 tablet/50 ml), stirred for 30 min at ambient temperature, and centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE FF anion exchange column (HiLoad 26/10; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA. Flow-through fractions containing Atox1 were concentrated and loaded onto an SP FF cation exchange column (HiLoad 26/10; Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA and eluted with a fourcolumn volume gradient of 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1 m NaCl. Atox1-containing fractions eluted at ∼200 mm NaCl were concentrated and purified further on a Superdex 75 column (HiLoad 16/60 prep grade; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl. The typical yield was ∼9–15 mg of pure protein/liter of E. coli culture. Cu(I) Loading of MBDs and Atox1—The copper-loaded forms of Atox1 (CuAtox1) and the MBD variants (CuMBD1–6) were prepared as follows. The MBD1–6 variants (∼50 μm) and Atox1 (∼1 mm) were incubated on ice for 30 min with 10 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.05 mm BCS. EDTA, DTT, and BCS were removed by two rounds of dialysis versus buffer H at 4 °C in a Coy anaerobic chamber equipped with an oxygen-scavenging system and maintained with a 95% N2, 5%H2 atmosphere. At this point, the samples were divided into two portions. Half was used as the reduced, apo form, and the other half was used for Cu(I) loading. A Cu(I) stock solution, stabilized as [CuCl4]3–, was prepared by dissolving Cu(I)Cl in 10 mm HCl, 1 m NaCl under anaerobic conditions. Then 0.9 eq of Cu(I) was added slowly in two or three portions to the MBDs followed by dialysis versus buffer H. MBD1–6 bind excess Cu(I) adventitiously so that only samples with copper/protein stoichiometries of ≤1.1 were used for further experiments. For Atox1, 1.1 eq of Cu(I) were added in a similar manner, except dialysis was replaced by chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (10/300 GL analytical grade; Amersham Biosciences) under anaerobic conditions immediately prior to use, because Cu(I) induces Atox1 aggregation over time. Copper Transfer Experiments—ApoMBD0–6 variants were mixed with increasing concentrations of CuAtox1 and incubated for >10 min anaerobically. Protein mixtures were separated by gel filtration on Superdex 75 preequilibrated with degassed buffer H kept under constant argon flow. Protein and Cu(I) concentration in all fractions were analyzed by the BCA assay (43Brenner A.J. Harris E.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 44Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) or by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (Varian). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and atomic absorption copper standard solution (990 μg/ml; Aldrich) were used as standards for protein and copper determinations, respectively. Protein concentrations of stock solutions were determined using extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 3,884 and 36,554 m–1 cm–1 for Atox1 and the MBD proteins, respectively (42Wernimont A.K. Yatsunyk L.A. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12269-12276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The starting apoMBDs had no detectable copper, and the typical Cu(I) stoichiometry per Atox1 monomer was 0.68 ± 0.12. Reverse copper transfer experiments from CuMBD1–6 to apoAtox1 were conducted in a similar manner. The starting CuMBD1–6 and apoAtox1 samples had copper/protein stoichiometries of 0.7–1.1 and 0.0002–0.0100, respectively. Both forward and reverse copper transfer data were used to estimate the equilibrium constants for copper redistribution between MBD1–6 and Atox1 (Reaction 1) as described previously (23Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18611-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar).CuAtox1+apoMBD⇄apoAtox1+CuMBDREACTION 1 As a specificity control, similar experiments were conducted between CuAtox1 and apoMBD0 as well as between CuAtox1 and BSA, an unrelated copper-binding protein. Whereas MBD0 has no metal binding cysteine residues and does not bind Cu(I), BSA binds up to 1.3 eq of Cu(I) when loaded according to the protocol described above. To confirm that Cu(I) transfer occurs through direct protein-protein interactions (rather than by copper dissociation and subsequent binding), Cu(I) transfer experiments between CuAtox1 and apoMBD6 were repeated in the presence of 0.1–0.6 mm BCA, a Cu(I)-specific chelator. A separate set of experiments was conducted in the presence of 1 mm GSH, a physiologically relevant Cu(I) chelator. Both BCA and GSH bind Cu(I) to form Cu(I)(BCA)2 (β2 = 4.60 × 1014 m–2; see below) and Cu(I)(GSH)2 (β2 = 1038.8 m–2 (45Osterberg R. Ligaarden R. Persson D. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1979; 10: 341-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)). ApoMBD6 was first mixed with BCA or GSH and then incubated with increasing concentrations of CuAtox1 for >10 min, followed by separation of the mixture by gel filtration. Chemical Modification of Cysteine Residues—Chemical modification was performed to test the surface accessibility of the metal binding cysteine residues. All manipulations except concentration steps were conducted anaerobically. The apo forms of MBD0-6 and Atox1 were used as negative controls. Cu(I)-bound proteins and apoproteins were modified with the cysteine-directed nonfluorescent probe N-β-maleimidopropionic acid (BMPA) for 2 h. BMPA was then removed by two rounds of concentration, followed by dilution with buffer H, and all samples were treated with 0.5 mm BCS to remove bound copper. After this step, the apoproteins should have no free cysteines, whereas the samples that formerly had Cu(I) bound should have only the copper-binding cysteines available for modification. After BCS removal, all samples were treated with an ∼50-fold excess of the cysteine-directed fluorescent probe, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2, 2′-disulfonic acid (AMS; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 5 min and 2 h. Samples were nutated in the dark at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with β-mercaptoethanol, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. AMS modification was detected by UV light, and the gel was then stained with Coomassie R-250. Relative Copper Binding by MBD1–6 Using the BCA Competition Assay—The CuMBD1–6 proteins were diluted to 20 μm Cu(I) with buffer H containing 0.20 mm ascorbate. A 20 μm Cu(I) solution was prepared from a copper atomic absorption standard in the same buffer as a control. A series of 11 BCA samples with concentrations of 0.6, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 mm were prepared. Copper control and protein solutions (90 μl) were mixed with 10-μl BCA solutions of increasing concentration and incubated for 1 h, 7 h, and overnight. The 1 h minimum time was chosen after optically monitoring copper binding by BCA as a function of time. The change in absorbance at 562 nm due to the formation of the Cu(I)(BCA)2 complex (extinction coefficient at 562 nm, 7,700 m–1 cm–1) plateaued after 45 min. Using an HP 8452A spectrophotometer, the absorbance at 562 nm was measured first for the buffer/ascorbate/BCA solution as a blank, followed by the 20 μm Cu(I)/ascorbate/BCA sample and finally by the CuMBD/ascorbate/BCA sample for each concentration of BCA. The estimated accuracy of this experiment is ±10%. Determination of the Apparent Association Constant Ka for the Cu(I)(BCA)2 Complex by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—Binding of Cu(I) to BCA was measured by ITC using a MicroCal MCS-ITC instrument under an anaerobic atmosphere. Experiments were conducted at 23–60 °C in buffer H that was thoroughly degassed, purged with argon, and stored in the anaerobic chamber. Before use, all buffers and stock solutions were filtered (pore size 0.22 μm; Fisherbrand) to remove any particulate matter. The ITC cell was loaded with a 75–80 μm Cu(I) solution prepared from copper atomic absorption standard in buffer H with 0.2 mm ascorbate. A 2 mm BCA solution prepared fresh in buffer H was"

The action of RPBs starts as soon as a nascent polypeptide becomes accessible from the outside of the ribosome and ends upon termination of translation. In yeast, RPBs include the chaperones Ssb1/2 and ribosome-associated complex, signal recognition particle, nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC), the aminopeptidases Map1 and Map2, and the Nα-terminal acetyltransferase NatA. Here, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of RPB binding at the yeast ribosomal tunnel exit as a function of translational status and polypeptide sequence. We measured the ratios of RPBs to ribosomes in yeast cells and determined RPB occupation of translating and non-translating ribosomes. The combined results imply a requirement for dynamic and coordinated interactions at the tunnel exit. Exclusively, NAC was associated with the majority of ribosomes regardless of their translational status. All other RPBs occupied only ribosomal subpopulations, binding with increased apparent affinity to randomly translating ribosomes as compared with non-translating ones. Analysis of RPB interaction with homogenous ribosome populations engaged in the translation of specific nascent polypeptides revealed that the affinities of Ssb1/2, NAC, and, as expected, signal recognition particle, were influenced by the amino acid sequence of the nascent polypeptide. Complementary cross-linking data suggest that not only affinity of RPBs to the ribosome but also positioning can be influenced in a nascent polypeptide-dependent manner.

Newly synthesized polypeptides exit the ribosome through a tunnel in the large ribosomal subunit. As soon as the polypeptides reach the tunnel exit, important decisions are required to direct subsequent steps of protein biogenesis. In all kingdoms of life a specific set of ribosome-associated protein biogenesis factors (termed RPBs 2The abbreviations used are: RPB, ribosome-associated protein biogenesis factor; BS3, bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; NAC, nascent polypeptide-associated complex; NAT, Nα-acetyltransferase; RAC, ribosome-associated complex consisting of Ssz1 and zuotin; RNC, ribosome nascent chain complex; SRP, signal recognition particle; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Pgk1, yeast 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. 2The abbreviations used are: RPB, ribosome-associated protein biogenesis factor; BS3, bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; NAC, nascent polypeptide-associated complex; NAT, Nα-acetyltransferase; RAC, ribosome-associated complex consisting of Ssz1 and zuotin; RNC, ribosome nascent chain complex; SRP, signal recognition particle; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Pgk1, yeast 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. hereafter) is mandatory for the process. However, RPBs differ significantly between bacterial and eukaryotic cells. Eubacteria possess trigger factor, a chaperone involved in cotranslational protein folding, which is restricted to eubacteria and signal recognition particle (SRP), a targeting factor involved in the translocation of membrane proteins with a hydrophobic signal-anchor sequence (1Maier T. Ferbitz L. Deuerling E. Ban N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 2Pool M.R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Consistent with the function of a general chaperone, trigger factor and ribosomes form 1:1 complexes whereas bacterial SRP, which is required for the biogenesis of only a subset of newly synthesized proteins, is present at ∼1 molecule/100 ribosomes (1Maier T. Ferbitz L. Deuerling E. Ban N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 3Jensen C.G. Pedersen S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7148-7154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, trigger factor and SRP bind to the same region close to the exit of the ribosomal tunnel (1Maier T. Ferbitz L. Deuerling E. Ban N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 2Pool M.R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The current view is that trigger factor and SRP can bind simultaneously to a single ribosome (1Maier T. Ferbitz L. Deuerling E. Ban N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); however, it was suggested that only one at a time contacts a nascent polypeptide (4Eisner G. Moser M. Schaöfer U. Beck K. Muöller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7172-7179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). According to this model, the decision-making process at the eubacterial tunnel exit would be straightforward: Whether trigger factor or SRP act on a nascent polypeptide depends on their relative affinities to the exposed stretches of amino acids (Refs. 4Eisner G.

Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7403-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 25Polevoda B. Sherman F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For sterical considerations it is difficult to envisage that the full set of eukaryotic RPBs interacts simultaneously with one ribosome. In addition, the time frame for the action of RPBs on nascent polypeptides is only short. Logarithmically growing yeast cells translate with a speed of ∼10 amino acids/second (26Bonven B. Gullov K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 170: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and thus for the majority of polypeptides cotranslational actions have to be completed in significantly less than a minute. How the arrangement of RPBs at the ribosomal tunnel exit is functionally coordinated in time and space is one of the challenging questions. A prerequisite to understanding the dynamics is information about the interaction of RPBs with ribosomes as a function of translational status and polypeptide sequence. Although the problem is straightforward, the methods to pinpoint RPB dynamics are not. Analysis requires a uniform population of non-translating ribosomes, as well as defined ribosome nascent chain complexes (RNCs) in quantities that allow for immunodetection of RPBs. Moreover, the concentration of a significant number of proteins has to be analyzed in complex mixtures. We have developed the tools and have performed the first thorough investigation of RPB-ribosome interaction under physiological conditions. To that end, we have employed a homologous system in which all RPBs, ribosomes, and RNCs including nascent polypeptides were derived from yeast. Experimental conditions were chosen such that the ratios between different RPBs and between RPBs and ribosomes were the same as in intact cells. We regard this as important, as it was shown in the Escherichia coli system that the normal ratio of cytosolic components is critical for the delicate balance of nascent polypeptide interactions (5Ullers R.S. Houben E.N. Brunner J. Oudega B. Harms N. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13999-14005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The approach allowed us to study the interaction of the whole set of RPBs with non-translating ribosomes, randomly translating ribosomes, and specific RNCs under conditions that resemble, as closely as possible, an intact cell. Construction of Plasmids—Genes encoding Rpl17a, Rpl39, Rps9a, Asc1, Srp54, Ard1, Nat1, Map1, Map2, and Ssb1 were amplified from yeast genomic DNA. In case of Asc1, Rps9a, and Rpl17a, the single intron was removed prior to transfer to the E. coli expression vector. For expression in E. coli all genes were fused to the N-terminal hexahistidine tag (His6) contained in pET28a (Novagen). Genes encoding Dap2 (yeast dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-B), ppα-factor (yeast prepro α-factor), and Pgk1 (yeast 3-phosphoglycerate kinase) were amplified from genomic DNA and were cloned into the transcription/translation vectors pSPUTK (Stratagene), pSP64, or pSP65 (Promega), resulting in plasmids pSPUTK-Dap2, pSPUTK-FLAG-Dap2, pSPUTK-Pgk1, pSPUTK-FLAG-E-Pgk1, pSPUTK-FLAG-E-ppα, pSPUTK-Dap2-E(2)K, pSP64-Pgk1-S(2)K, and pSP65-ppα-R(2)K. N-terminal FLAG tags (DYKDDDDK) and lysines were introduced via the forward primer as indicated. In the FLAG-tagged versions of Pgk1 and ppα-factor the first amino acid after the tag was converted to glutamate. Purification of His6-tagged Standard Proteins—Proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid according to the manufacturer’s protocol for native or denatured protein purification, respectively (Qiagen). His6-Rpl17a, His6-Rpl39, His6-Nat1, His6-Map1, and His6-Map2 were further purified by extraction from a preparative 10 or 16% (for Rpl39) Tris-Tricine gel (27Schaögger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). To that end, protein bands were cut, homogenized in 1× cathode buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.25, 0.1 m Tricine, 0.1% SDS), and were finally precipitated by adding 2 volumes of ice-cold acetone. Pellets were solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8 m urea. His6-Nat1 was insoluble in 8 m urea and was resolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol. Purification procedures for NAC and RAC have been reported elsewhere (10Gautschi M. Lilie H. Fuönfschilling U. Mun A. Ross S. Lithgow T. Ruöcknagel P. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3762-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 17Fuönfschilling U. Rospert S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3289-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Determination of Protein Concentrations—Protein concentrations were determined according to the manufacturers’ manuals, with bovine serum albumin as a standard by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), the BCA assay (Sigma), and the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) or were calculated from absorption at 280 nm (supplemental Table S1). Antibodies and Immunoblotting Procedures—Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits (EUROGENTEC, Bel S. A.). Antibodies directed against the antigens Rpl17a, Rps9a, and Ssb1 also recognized the functionally redundant homologs Rpl17b (99% identical to Rpl17a), Rps9b (97% identical to Rps9a), and Ssb2 (99% identical to Ssb1), respectively. Concentrations throughout the study relate to the overall concentration of Rpl17a/Rpl17b (Rpl17), Rps9a/Rps9b (Rps9), and Ssb1/Ssb2 (Ssb1/2). Immunoblots were developed using ECL with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) as the secondary antibody or with 125I-labeled protein A (28Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). For ECL detection membranes were incubated for 1 min in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, either in the presence of 1× reagent (0.2 mm p-cumaric acid in Me2SO, 1.2 mm luminol sodium salt in Me2SO, 0.01% H2O2) in case of quantifications of purified RNCs, or with 0.5× reagent for all other immunoblots. Quantifications were performed using the AIDA ImageAnalyzer (Raytest). Quantification of Ribosomes and RPBs in Yeast Cells—Total yeast extract was prepared by the method of Yaffe and Schatz (29Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4819-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) from log-phase (A600 = 0.7–1.2) wild type yeast strain MH272-3fα (23Rakwalska M. Rospert S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9186-9197Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) grown on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose). Cell numbers were determined using a Neubauer improved counting chamber (Marienfeld). MH272–3fα of an A600 = 1 contained 4.48 × 107 cells/ml. The concentration of ribosomes and RPBs/cell was calculated from the molar protein concentrations/ml divided by the cell number/ml. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—Yeast translation extracts were prepared as previously described (30Garcia P.D. Hansen W. Walter P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) from strain JK9–3dα (31Heitmann J. Movva N.R. Hiestand P.C. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1948-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). RNCs were generated as previously described (17Fuönfschilling U. Rospert S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3289-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Templates for transcription reactions were generated by PCR using one of the following plasmids as a template: pSPUTK-Dap2, pSPUTK-FLAG-Dap2, pSPUTK-Pgk1, pSPUTK-FLAG-E-Pgk1, pDJ100 (encoding wild type ppα-factor, provided by J. Brodsky), and pSPUTK-FLAG-E-ppα or for cross-linking experiments pSP64-Pgk1-S(2)K, pSPUTK-dap2-E(2)K, pSP65-ppα-R(2)K, and pSP65-ppα-S(5)K. Cross-linking of Nascent Polypeptides to RPBs—The homobifunctional cross-linker bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)-suberate (BS3) was used for cross-linking reactions (spacer length, 1.14 nm; Pierce). Cross-linking reactions and immunoprecipitations under denaturing conditions were performed as previously described (20Gautschi M. Mun A. Ross S. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). αMap2 did not efficiently immunoprecipitate Map2. We have therefore not tested for Map2 cross-links. All other RPBs were tested (see “Results”). Purification of FLAG-tagged RNCs under Native Conditions—For a typical experiment 75-μl translation reactions were performed at 20 °C for 80 min and were terminated by the addition of cycloheximide to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. Translation reactions were then added to 40 μl of ANTI-FLAG ® M2 affinity gel (αFLAG-beads; Sigma) resuspended in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm potassium acetate acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 50 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mix: 1.25 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.75 μg/ml antipain, 0.25 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.25 μg/ml elastinal, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A). Native immunoprecipitation reactions were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C on a shaker. The beads were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation and were washed twice with 500 μl of ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer. Immunoblotting confirmed that RPBs were not lost during the washes (data not shown). Washed αFLAG beads were incubated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 10 min at 95 °C, and aliquots and standard proteins were run on the same 10% Tris-Tricine gels. Non-tagged versions of each nascent polypeptide were translated and analyzed in parallel reactions to determine the background signal. His6-Rps9a was used as a standard for the determination of RNCs. Resulting values for Rps9a/b were divided by the factor 0.7 corresponding to the deviation of Rps9a/b from the mean value of all four ribosomal proteins (Table 1). Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate.TABLE 1Quantification of RPBs and ribosomes in a logarithmically growing yeast cellProtein/subunitProtein/subunit per cellOligomer per cellRPBs per 100 ribosomesRibosomeRps92.2 × 1053.15 × 105Asc12.6 × 105Rpl393.9 × 105Rpl173.9 × 105Ssb1/2Ssb1/22.80 × 10589.1RACSsz16.71 × 1048.61 × 10427.3Zuo11.05 × 105NACαNAC3.91 × 105125SRPSrp547.85 × 1032.5Map1Map12.11 × 1046.7Map2Map26.21 × 1032.0NatANat17.66 × 1037.63 × 1032.4Ard17.59 × 103 Open table in a new tab Generation of Non-translating and Translating Ribosomes—Efficient puromycin release requires conditions of high ionic strength (32Blobel G. Sabatini D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), which interfere with ribosome association of RPBs. To prevent such release of RPBs from ribosomes we have made use of the observation that non-translating ribosomes are efficiently generated in vivo when glucose is removed from the growth medium (33Ashe M.P. De Long S.K. Sachs A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). For the analysis of RPB interaction with randomly translating ribosomes and non-translating ribosomes, cultures of MH272-3fα were grown to an A600 of 0.4 at 30 °C on YPD, collected, and resuspended in YPD or in YP medium lacking glucose. Growth was resumed for 10 min at 30 °C. Cells were harvested in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide to stabilize translating ribosomes. Preparation of cell extract was carried out by glass bead disruption in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm potassium acetate acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol as described (33Ashe M.P. De Long S.K. Sachs A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Of each lysate 10 A260 units were loaded onto a 10.8-ml 15–55% linear sucrose gradient and centrifuged for 2.5 h at 200 000 × g. Gradients were fractionated from top to bottom with a density gradient fractionator (Teledyne Isco, Inc.) monitoring A254. RPB Concentration in Yeast Cells—Quantification of untagged RPBs and ribosomes in complex mixtures requires quantitative immunoblotting. We have heterologously expressed and purified His6-tagged versions of four ribosomal proteins and at least one subunit of each yeast RPB (Fig. 1A and Table 1. Protein concentrations of the purified standards were determined by two unrelated quantification methods (“Experimental Procedures” and supplemental Table S1). Total extracts derived from logarithmically growing yeast cells containing 3–5 × 107 cells/ml were applied to quantitative immunoblotting with purified RPBs as standards. Representative immunoblots (Fig. 1B) and corresponding standard curves (Fig. 1C) are shown. Further calculations are based on the average concentration of subunits that form stable oligomeric complexes (Table 1). Based on this evaluation, a yeast cell contained ∼310,000 ribosomal particles, 400,000 molecules of NAC, 280,000 molecules of Ssb1/2, and 90,000 molecules of RAC. SRP and the group of RPBs that modify nascent polypeptides enzymatically were ∼one order of magnitude less abundant. A yeast cell contained 20,000 molecules of Map1, and 6,000–8,000 molecules of Map2, NatA, and SRP each. The ratio between ribosomes and RPBs excludes that the bulk of ribosomes are occupied by the complete set of RPBs at steady state. Rather, the data suggest dynamic cycling on and off ribosomes for all RPBs with the exception of NAC and Ssb1/2 (see below). Qualitative Analysis of RPB Interaction with Randomly Translating Ribosomes—Association of RPBs with ribosomes and polysomes in total cell extract can be qualitatively demonstrated by sucrose density centrifugation (Fig. 2A). Resulting ribosome profiles have been previously employed to demonstrate ribosome association of Ssb1/2 (8Nelson R.J. Ziegelhoffer T. Nicolet C. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A.

EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The variability most likely reflects differences in extract preparation and buffer composition and complicates a comparative evaluation of existing data. Moreover, ribosome profiles of Map2 and yeast SRP have not previously been published. We have now revisited the issue and have analyzed in parallel the distribution of the complete set of RPBs in a polysome-rich extract (Fig. 2B). Gentle extract preparation and physiological salt concentrations revealed that the bulk of NAC, RAC, NatA, Map1, and Map2 was bound to polysomes and 80 S ribosomes. As reported previously, Ssb1/2 (8Nelson R.J. Ziegelhoffer T. Nicolet C. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 97-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) was abundant also in the cytosolic fraction. SRP was the only other RPB detected in the cytosolic fraction in significant amounts (Fig. 2B). After release from ribosomes, RPBs colocalized with soluble cytosolic proteins, confirming that comigration in the profiles was due to ribosome association (data not shown). Quantitative Analysis of RPB Interaction with Non-translating and Randomly Translating Ribosomes—The ratio of ribosomes to RPB in each fraction is a measure of how many ribosomes are occupied by a particular RPB. To analyze the effect of the general translational status on these interactions, we have determined the ratio between ribosomes and RPBs in polysomal fractions as well as in fractions containing non-translating ribosomes (Fig. 3A). On average, 88% of non-translating ribosomes were occupied by NAC, 19% by RAC, 15% by Ssb1/2, 2% by Map1, 2% by NatA, and 1% by Map2. SRP was not detected in fractions containing non-translating ribosomes. 89% of randomly translating ribosomes were occupied by NAC, 35% by RAC, 30% by Ssb1/2, 4% by Map1 and NatA, 2% by Map2, and 1% by SRP (Fig. 3B). In general, RPBs displayed a preference for translating ribosomes over non-translating ribosomes, which is consistent with their function. An exception was NAC, which occupied even non-translating ribosomes to a large extent. Please note that Ssb1/2, which approximately equals the number of ribosomes in total extract, occupied only about one third of ribosomes involved in translation (see also “Discussion”). RPB Interaction with RNCs Carrying Either Cytosolic or ER-targeted Nascent Polypeptides—Polysomes carry an undefined mixture of nascent polypeptides with respect to amino acid sequence. To assess how RPB binding was affected in the presence of specific nascent polypeptides, we generated RNCs engaged in the translation of particular nascent polypeptides (Fig. 4). To that end, in vitro translation reactions were performed using truncated, stop codon-less mRNAs as a template. Under the conditions of the experiment, the bulk of nascent polypeptides remained quantitatively and firmly attached to ribosomes (supplemental Fig. S1A). To purify specific RNCs, nascent polypeptides were fused to"
https://openalex.org/W1967413008,"Atg3 is an E2-like enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation of Atg8 and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The Atg8-PE conjugate is essential for autophagy, which is the bulk degradation process of cytoplasmic components by the vacuolar/lysosomal system. We report here the crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Atg3 at 2.5-Aå resolution. Atg3 has an α/β-fold, and its core region is topologically similar to canonical E2 enzymes. Atg3 has two regions inserted in the core region, one of which consists of ∼80 residues and has a random coil structure in solution and another with a long α-helical structure that protrudes from the core region as far as 30Aå. In vivo and in vitro analyses suggested that the former region is responsible for binding Atg7, an E1-like enzyme, and that the latter is responsible for binding Atg8. A sulfate ion was bound near the catalytic cysteine of Atg3, suggesting a possible binding site for the phosphate moiety of PE. The structure of Atg3 provides a molecular basis for understanding the unique lipidation reaction that Atg3 carries out."

A peptide cytotoxin has been purified from X. nematophila broth growth, and the cytolytic effect on insect immunocytes and hemolytic effect on mammalian red blood cells of this toxin have been described (Ribeiro, C., Vignes, M., and Brehélin, M. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 3030–3039). We show here that this toxin, Xenorhabdus α-xenorhabdolysin (Xax), triggers apoptosis in both insect and mammalian cells. We also report the cloning and sequencing of two genes, xaxAB, encoding this toxin in X. nematophila. The expression of both genes in recombinant Escherichia coli led to the production of active cytotoxin/hemolysin. However, hemolytic activity was observed only if the two peptides were added in the appropriate order. Furthermore, we report here that inactivation of xaxAB genes in X. nematophila abolished the major cytotoxic activity present in broth growth, called C1. We also show that these genes are present in various entomopathogenic bacteria of the genera Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus, in Pseudomonas entomophila, in the human pathogens Yersinia enterocolitica and Proteus mirabilis, and in the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. This toxin cannot be classified in any known family of cytotoxins on the basis of amino acid sequences, locus organization, and activity features. It is, therefore, probably the prototype of a new family of binary toxins.

It is, therefore, probably the prototype of a new family of binary toxins. Entomopathogenic bacteria are widely used as crop protection agents. Most studies on these bacteria have focused on the properties of insecticidal toxins, with a view to improving them. These pathogens are able to overcome insect immune responses (1Brehélin M. Drif L. Baud L. Boemare N. Insect Biochem. 1989; 19: 301-307Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 2Park Y. Kim Y. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 1469-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which parallel those of mammals to some extent. Insects do not have adaptive immunity and are easy to handle, making them a powerful tool for studies of host innate immunity and for the identification of bacterial virulence factors (3Miyata S. Casey M. Frank D.W. Ausubel F.M. Drenkard E. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2404-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The genomes of invertebrate pathogens represent a potentially extensive reservoir of virulence genes that have evolved over long periods to overcome the innate immune responses of their hosts. This virulence gene pool may act as a source of virulence factors for transfer into human commensal or pathogenic bacteria (4Waterfield N. Wren B. ffrench-Constant R. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 833-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Xenorhabdus nematophila (Enterobacteriaceae) is a Gram-negative bacterium that is transported into insects by the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae. Once inside the insect, it secretes various extracellular factors, including antibiotics, lipases, proteases, and toxins, which are involved in insect killing (5Forst S. Nealson K. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 21-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, X. nematophila grows within the body of the insect and must, therefore, be able to escape the immune response, but little is known about the way in which it does this. Cellular immunity comes into play immediately after the penetration of a foreign body into the insect hemocoel, and X. nematophila must escape these potent cellular reactions. Hemocytes are the immunocytes of insects, and cellular immune reactions against bacteria involve cells of several different lineages. In our insect model, Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera), plasmatocytes build nodules that isolate clumps of bacteria and necrotic insect tissues, and granular hemocytes are the professional phagocytes (6Ribeiro C. Brehélin M. J. Insect Physiol. 2006; 52: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Cytotoxic factors targeting these immune system cells are good candidates for the molecules mediating immunosuppression. In X. nematophila grown in liquid culture, various cytotoxic activities principally targeting the hemocytes have been identified (7Ribeiro C. Duvic B. Oliveira P. Givaudan A. Palha F. Simoes N.

C1 lyses cells via a mechanism involving protein toxins, as it is susceptible to heat and trypsin (8Brillard J. Ribeiro C. Boemare N. Brehélin M. Givaudan A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2515-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and a peptide cytotoxin called α-xenorhabdolysin (αX) has been purified from a culture medium with C1 activity (9Ribeiro C. Vignes M. Brehélin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3030-3039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).We report here the molecular characterization of this cytotoxin produced by X. nematophila and show that it has both necrotic and apoptotic activities in insect hemocytes and mammalian cells. The genes encoding this toxin were also identified in various plant and human pathogens.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Production and Purification of Toxin—The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. X. nematophila (strain F1, laboratory collection) were grown in Luria Bertani broth at 28 °C. In these conditions cytotoxic C1 production was maximal in 20-h-old cultures (8Brillard J. Ribeiro C. Boemare N. Brehélin M. Givaudan A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2515-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The cytotoxin was prepared as described (9Ribeiro C. Vignes M. Brehélin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3030-3039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with a modification of the final step (reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)) that was replaced by a HPLC gel filtration on 60 cm × 7.5-mm inner diameter column (TSKgel, G3000SW TosoHaas) with elution in 0.25 ml/min phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH7) containing 300 mm NaCl. Under these conditions positive fractions were eluted in a single peak. These fractions were used as purified cytotoxin. The cytotoxin was named Xenorhabdus α-xenorhabdolysin (Xax).TABLE 1Strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmidDescriptionReferenceE. coliSURE 2e14-(McrA-)Δ(mcrCB-hsdSMR-mrr)171 endA1 supE44 thi-1 gyrA96 relA1 lac recB recJ sbcC umuCΔTn5 (Kanr) uvrC [F′ proAB lac1qZ Ω M15 Tn10 (Tetr)]StratageneTop10F- mcrA.(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) Δ 80lacZ M15.lacX74 deoR recA1 araD139(araA-leu)7697 galU galK rpsL endA1 nupGInvitrogenCFP201MC4100 sheA::Tn5-2.1 null mutantRef. 10del Castillo F.J.

The toxin was also purified as described above from these E. coli extracts.Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry was performed offline on a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QSTAR Pulsar-i, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) fitted with a Protana nanospray inlet system (Protana, Odense, Denmark). Spectra were recorded with Analyst QS software (Applied Biosystems). Parameters were adjusted as follows: ion spray voltage, 900 V; curtain gas, 25; declustering potential, 45–75 V; focusing potential (FP), 265 V; declustering potential 2, 15 V. Peptides were fragmented in the collision cell using nitrogen gas on the doubly charged ions detected, with an individually optimized collision energy profile (30–55 V). Capillaries (Protana, Odense, Denmark) were loaded with the samples according to the following procedure; each aliquot after trypsin cleavage was solubilized in 5 μl of 1% formic acid, desalted on Poros 20 R2 (Applied Biosystems), packed into a gel-loader pipette tip, and eluted with 1.5 μl of 50:50:1 methanol/water/formic acid (13Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). The loaded capillaries were placed in the source tip holder. Molecules were identified by manual partial interpretations of spectra and by means of MASCOT searches (in-house server, Swissprot and Trembl merged data base).Plasmid Derivatives and Gene Cloning—E. coli Sure 2 (Stratagene) was used as an intermediate host for cloning experiments. The oligonucleotide primer sets used (Table 2) were designed from an alignment of several hemolysin loci from other bacteria including Photorhabdus luminescens, X. nematophila, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Standard PCR with each primer set was performed in a 50-μl reaction volume with a Gene Amp 2400 thermocycler system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For cloning we generated xaxAB, xaxA, and xaxB fragments with flanking XbaI and SalI sites by PCR. These fragments were inserted into pBBR1MCS-5 to generate pBBxaxAB, pBBxaxA, and pBBxaxB, respectively (Table 1). All constructs were checked by DNA sequencing (MilleGen, Toulouse, France).TABLE 2Primer sets used in this studyPrimerSequenceConstructBsal1fwGCAGTCGACTTAATGATGCGCTGAAGCTGPBBxaxBBxba1revGCATCTAGAGCGGTATATCCGTTGGAGAGpBBxaxB/ABABsal1fwGCAGTCGACTGCCACTAATATAGGTGGTGATGpBBxaxA/AB/pAB6AF1xba1revGCATCTAGACTGCCTGATTCATGGCTTTApBBxaxAEAXBam-revCGGGATCCTTTCAGCCAGCTGCTTATCAGpAB6AMHnco1fwGCACCATGGAGAACGATATGTCATCAAATpXaxA-Myc-HisAMHxba1revGCATCTAGAATGTGATAGAGTTTTTTATATTCAGCCpXaxA-Myc-HisB6HAHind3fwGCAAAGCTTGATGTCTGACAATACCCTCTCApXaxB-HA-HisB6HANot1revGCAGCGGCCGCCGTTTCAGCTTATTGTACpXaxB-HA-His Open table in a new tab Nucleotide Sequence Accession Number—The sequence of the X. nematophila xaxAB locus has been assigned GenBank™ accession number DQ249320.Construction of the xaxAB-null Strain, xaxAB9—Deletion of a 1-kilobase region overlapping xaxA and xaxB ORFs was realized in two steps. The first one was to amplify the first 480 bp of xaxA from pBBxaxAB (Table 1) as the template and by using primers ABsal1fw and EAXBam-rev (Table 2), which contain, respectively, SalI and BamHI restriction sites. The PCR fragment, digested with SalI and BamHI, was then cloned into the corresponding sites of the pBBxaxAB, which contain only the last 770 bp of xaxB and yields plasmid pAB6. Then a chloramphenicol-resistant Ω cassette (11Fellay R. Frey J. Krisch H. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) with transcriptional and translational terminators was inserted into the unique BamHI site within the disrupted xaxAB operon of pAB6 to yield plasmid pAB7. The xaxAB region carrying the Cm-interposon was, therefore, purified by digestion of plasmid pAB7 with SalI and XbaI and cloning into the corresponding sites of the pJQ200KS, resulting in plasmid pAB9 (Table 1). Experiment mating and exconjugant selection were done as previously described (14Givaudan A. Lanois A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Production and Purification of Tagged Peptides—For the production of recombinant hemolysin, we generated xaxA and xaxB fragments with flanking HindIII, NcoI, NotI, and Xbal sites by PCR and inserted them into pBAD-B-Myc-His (Invitrogen) or pHB6-HA-His (Roche Applied Science) in-frame with the Myc-His tag or the HA-His tag, respectively, creating XaxAMyc-His and XaxBHA-His (Tables 1 and 2). All constructs were checked by DNA sequencing (MilleGen, Toulouse, France) before being used to transform the E. coli TOP10 and XL1blue strains. Recombinant polyhistidine-tagged proteins were purified on a Protino Ni-IDA 2000 column according to the manufacturer's instruction (Macheray-Nagel, Germany) (see supplemental Fig. S2).Hemolytic Activity and Titration of the Toxin Solutions—SRBC and RRBC were obtained from BioMérieux (France) as a 50% suspension. They were extensively washed in pH 7.2 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were diluted in this buffer to give a 5% suspension. We tested the hemolytic activity of bacteria grown on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% SRBC. Hemolysis was observed as a clear zone surrounding colonies. Hemolysis was also assessed in 5% SRBC or RRBC suspensions as described (9Ribeiro C. Vignes M. Brehélin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3030-3039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The titer of a toxin solution can be calculated from the absorbance value obtained according to the following formula, deduced from numerous absorbance determinations with serial dilutions of toxin (9Ribeiro C. Vignes M. Brehélin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3030-3039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar): titer (in HU) = 2 × 10(OD – 0.72).In some experiments we assessed osmotic protection by adding polyethylene glycol 6000 to the toxin solution at a final concentration of 30 mm before incubation with the SRBC. In other experiments, before testing for hemolysis we incubated the toxin solutions alone for 1 h at 60 °C or for 1 h at 37 °C with trypsin (30 units) or with SRBC ghosts as described (9Ribeiro C. Vignes M. Brehélin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3030-3039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).In a series of experiments, SRBC were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in toxin solutions. The mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C, and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured. We then added 50 μl of a SRBC suspension to this supernatant, incubated the mixture at 37 °C for 1 h, centrifuged it at 10,000 × g, and determined the absorbance at 540 nm of this second supernatant. The pellet obtained after incubation at 4 °C was rapidly rinsed, suspended in PBS, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and its absorbance was measured. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Recombinant purified epitope-tagged XaxAMyc-His and XaxBHA-His were incubated in Nonidet P-40 buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 Mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) at 4 °C with monoclonal mouse anti-c-Myc (clone 9E10, Upstate Biotechnology) or monoclonal anti-HA (clone F-7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h. As controls, XaxAMyc-His was incubated with CifHA-His, a recombinant polyhistidine HA-tagged irrelevant protein (15Marchès E. Ledger T.N. Boury M. Ohara M. TU X. Goffaux F. Mainil J. Rosenshine I. Sugai M. De Rycke J. Oswald E. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and XaxBHA-His was incubated with recombinant polyhistidine Myc-tagged Cif (CifMyc-His). 5R. Zumbihl, unpublished data. Immune complexes were then collected with protein-G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and washed four times with Nonidet P-40 buffer. Immunoprecipitates were mixed with 2× Laemmli buffer and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted using anti-Myc antibodies after immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-HA or immunoblotted with polyclonal anti-HA (Sigma H6908: rabbit anti-HA tag, affinity-isolated antibody) after immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibodies followed by mouse or rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Signals were generated by the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (GE Healthcare) and detected using x-ray film.Insects, Hemocyte Monolayer Preparation, Human Cell Lines, and Test for Cytotoxic Activity—Insect (larvae of S. littoralis) rearing and hemocyte monolayer preparation were described (9Ribeiro C. Vignes M. Brehélin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3030-3039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cytotoxic activity was tested on hemocyte monolayers and human cell lines on 12-mm glass coverslips (105 cells/coverslip) in a moist chamber at 23 °C (insect) or 37 °C (human) for 10 min to 2 h. Cell mortality was checked by adding 2 μl of trypan blue dye (0.04% final in PBS) and 5 min more of incubation. Specimen preparation for transmission electron microscopy observation was described in Ribeiro et al. (9Ribeiro C. Vignes M. Brehélin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3030-3039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Test for Apoptosis—We assessed apoptosis in target cells by TUNEL staining (kit from Roche Applied Science), after incubating cells (hemocyte monolayers or HeLa cell line) for 12 h with toxin solution (5 × 10–3 HU) in modified Eagle's medium and RPMI, respectively. We checked that TUNEL-positive cells were actually apoptotic by adding z-VAD-fmk (a pan-caspase inhibitor) or z-DEVD-fmk (caspase 3-specific inhibitor) to the medium and comparing the proportion (after angular transformation) of TUNEL-positive cells with that in experiments carried out in the absence of inhibitor.RESULTSPurification of the Toxin and Peptide Sequence Determination—Early stationary phase X. nematophila C1 supernatants (8Brillard J. Ribeiro C. Boemare N. Brehélin M. Givaudan A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2515-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were collected, and the toxin was purified as described above, with fractions displaying cytolytic activity against insect hemocytes and hemolytic activity against SRBC eluted in a single peak. When SRBC were incubated at 4 °C with purified toxin (see “Experimental Procedures”), all hemolytic activity remained in the supernatant (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, when active fractions from gel filtration were analyzed by C18 reversephase chromatography (0–95% acetonitrile gradient and 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid), no peak was detected, and no hemolytic or cytolytic activity was detected even in the void volume. Similarly, no ion was detected when positive fractions were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization or quadrupole time-of-flight in the absence of proteolytic digestion (data not shown).After trypsin digestion, several apparently doubly charged signals were selected in the BM031219Q-B2 sample for collision-induced decomposition. Only the peak at m/z 536.74 led to an identification (score 45; under our conditions, the significance threshold was 43), using the MS/MS ion search subroutine from MASCOT. This signal was identified as peptide IIESQDVIR from the Q7N5I7_PHOLL protein. Alternatively, the MQ(I/L)D partial sequence could be obtained by manually interpreting the collision-induced decomposition spectrum resulting from the peak at m/z 553.75. Using the sequence query search subroutine of MASCOT, this signal was identified as the DVMQIDTER peptide from the same protein.Identification of Putative Hemolysin Loci in Different Bacterial Pathogens—The 342-amino acid protein containing both peptide sequences from Xax is a putative protein encoded by gene plu1961 (Fig. 2) in Photorhabdus luminescens TT01 (16Duchaud E. Rusniok C. Frangeul L. Buchrieser C. Givaudan A. Taourit S. Bocs S. Boursaux-Eude C. Chandler M. Charles J.F. Dassa E. Derose R. Derzelle S. Freyssinet G. Gaudriault S. Medigue C. Lanois A. Powell K.

Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), a bacterium closely related to Xenorhabdus. Because the entire genome sequence of P. luminescens has been described, the genomic sequences flanking plu1961 showed that plu1962 was found immediately upstream from plu1961, strongly suggesting that these genes are cotranscribed. This putative hemolysin locus is located downstream from a gene encoding a tRNA for lysine in the TT01 genome. Another operon encoding similar proteins (plu3075–3076) (61 and 49% identity to plu1961 and plu1962, respectively) was found elsewhere in the P. luminescens genome, adjacent to the nuoA to nuoN region encoding putative NADH dehydrogenases. The genomic organization of this second putative hemolysin locus was found to be conserved in the genome of a clinical isolate of Photorhabdus asymbiotica isolated from patients in the United States (US3105/77) (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/P_asymbiotica/). In the completed genome sequences of bacteria, Plu1961 and Plu1962 display blastP matches (E value between 3e-7 to 3e-33) with two pairs of putative proteins (Psyr_3990, Psyr_3989 and PSTPO4287, PSTP04571) predicted from the genome sequences of two pathovars of the plant pathogenic bacteria, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Fig. 2) and pv. tomato, respectively (17Feil H. Feil W. Chain P. Larimer F. DiBartolo G. Copeland A. Lykidis A. Trong S. Nolan M. Goltsman E. Thiel J. Malfatti S. Loper J. Lapidus A. Detter J. Land M. Richardson P. Kyrpides N. Ivanova N. Lindow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11064-11069Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Recently, Vodovar et al. (18Vodovar N. Vallenet D. Cruveiller S. Rouy Z. Barbe V. Acosta C. Cattolico L. Jubin C. Lajus A. Segurens B. Vacherie B. Wincker P. Weissenbach J. Lemaitre B. Medigue C. Boccard F. Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) reported the genome sequence of an insect pathogen bacterium belonging to the genus Pseudomonas, P. entomophila, and they also showed that this bacterium secretes a diffusible hemolysin activity on sheep blood agar contrary to the other Pseudomonads. Using the Microbial Genome Annotation System (www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/mage/wwwpkgdb/), two closely linked genes encoding predicted proteins PSEEN4370 and PSEEN 4369 similar to XaxA and XaxB family (supplemental Fig. S1), respectively, were detected in the genome sequence of P. entomophila. Both genes are located at a synteny break point between the genomes of P. entomophila and the other Pseudomonas spp. We also searched for homologues of this pair of genes in the bacterial genomes that are currently being sequenced. Significant similarities were found in TblastN searches between Plu1961 and Plu1962 and two predicted proteins from Y. enterocolitica (E = 1.5e-43 and 4.1e-83, respectively) (Fig. 2) and from Proteus mirabilis HI4320 (E = 6.3e-9 and 7.5e-57) (www.sanger.ac.uk/). Finally, we detected homologues to this pair of genes (plu1961–1962), as expected, in the incomplete genome sequence of a X. nematophila strain (E = 5e-96 and 1e-130) (xenorhabdus.danforthcenter.org/). As shown in Fig. 2, the putative hemolysin loci, containing two closely linked genes similar to plu1961–62, were found in the same orientation in different genomic contexts in the chromosome of Xenorhabdus, Photorhabdus, P. syringae, and Yersinia. However, these potential virulence genes are not located on or in the vicinity of mobile genetic elements.FIGURE 2Predicted genetic organizations of xaxAB hemolysin loci in the genomic sequences of various Gram-negative bacteria. All genes in the chromosomal sections are indicated by gray arrows, except for xaxAB homologues, which are shown in dark gray. Genomic organizations were compared using genomic data from P. luminescens laumondii (strain TT01) (genolist.pasteur.fr/PhotoList/), P. syringae pv. syringae B728a (img.jgi.doe.gov), Y. enterocolitica 8081 (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Y_enterocolitica), and X. nematophila ATCC19061 (maizeapache.ddpsc.org/xeno_blast/). Because X. nematophila sequencing has not yet been completed, ORFs were detected using ORF finder (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html), and deduced amino acid sequences were then compared using the blastP algorithm at the NCBI. Locus tag numbers and predicted products are mentioned below and above the arrows, respectively. The numbers in the margins indicate the coordinates on the chromosome. Peptide sequences obtained after sequence searches using MASCOT are indicated together with matches with the deduced amino acid sequence of Plu1961 from P. luminescens TTO1 (Q7N5I7). RNB, exoribonuclease II.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)XaxAB from X. nematophila F1 Is a Functional Hemolysin/Cytolysin—To demonstrate that this locus encoded Xax, we first cloned the potential hemolysin locus from X. nematophila F1 and expressed recombinant xaxAB in E. coli (see “Experimental Procedures”). No E. coli transformants were obtained when xaxAB was inserted into high copy number plasmids, such as pUC19. The region encompassing the xaxAB genes was amplified and cloned under control of the plac promoter in a medium copy number plasmid, pBBR1MCS-5 resulting in pBBxaxAB, which was then transferred to the E. coli SURE strain. As expected, in the presence of 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d -galactopyranoside, the E. coli SURE (pBBxaxAB) strain displayed strong hemolytic activity on sheep blood agar plate, whereas the clone containing vector alone (pBBR1MCS-5) did not (Fig. 3). This suggests that this locus is involved in hemolytic activity. However, several studies have shown that the overproduction of heterologous regulators (19Westermark M. Oscarsson J. Mizunoe Y. Urbonaviciene J. Uhlin B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6347-6357Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or the presence of prophagic inserts containing a holin locus from X. nematophila (20Brillard J. Boyer-Giglio M.-H.

https://openalex.org/W1966462828,"Colanic acid (CA) or M-antigen is an exopolysaccharide produced by many enterobacteria, including the majority of Escherichia coli strains. Unlike other capsular polysaccharides, which have a close association with the bacterial surface, CA forms a loosely associated saccharide mesh that coats the bacteria, often within biofilms. Herein we show that a highly mucoid strain of E. coli K-12 ligates CA repeats to a significant proportion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core acceptor molecules, forming the novel LPS glycoform we call MLPS.MLPS biosynthesis is dependent upon (i) CA induction, (ii) LPS core biosynthesis, and (iii) the O-antigen ligase WaaL. Compositional analysis, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of a purified MLPS sample confirmed the presence of a CA repeat unit identical in carbohydrate sequence, but differing at multiple positions in anomeric configuration and linkage, from published structures of extracellular CA. The attachment point was identified as O-7 of the l-glycero-d-manno-heptose of the outer LPS core, the same position used for O-antigen ligation. When O-antigen biosynthesis was restored in the K-12 background and grown under conditions meeting the above specifications, only MLPS was observed, suggesting E. coli can reversibly change its proximal covalently linked cell surface polysaccharide coat from O-antigen to CA in response to certain environmental stimuli. The identification of MLPS has implications for potential underlying mechanisms coordinating the synthesis of various surface polysaccharides.

Biochem. 2006; 75: 39-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), poly β-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PNAG) (4Wang X. Preston 3rd, J.F. Romeo T. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2724-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), the β-1,4-glucan polymer bacterial cellulose (5Zogaj X. Nimtz M. Rohde M. Bokranz W. Romling U. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1452-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), and colanic acid (CA or M-antigen) (6Grant W.D. Sutherland I.W. Wilkinson J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 1187-1193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tremendous diversity within the serotype specific repeat units [∼170 O-antigens, ∼80 K-antigens (7Ørskov I. Ørskov F. Jann B. Jann K. Bacteriol. Rev. 1977; 41: 667-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)], coupled with regulation of expression levels between polysaccharide classes, facilitates the expression of a multitude of glycocalyx compositions. For each strain and/or given growth environment, a number of cell coat polysaccharide states can be sampled to attain a balance that is suitable for a particular niche. The network of E. coli surface polysaccharides can be further subdivided into those that are tightly associated or covalently linked to the outer membrane (OM) (O/K-antigens, ECA) and those that are loosely associated, called exo- or slime polysaccharides. The exopolysaccharides (in particular CA and PNAG (8Agladze K. Wang X. Romeo T. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8237-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)) are integral components of biofilms, acting as the “cement,” which holds together the various protein, lipid, and polysaccharide components (9Sutherland I. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). The vast majority of CA is secreted into this extracellular milieu, with no evidence existing of a lipid anchor tethering CA chains to the OM. Disruption of the putative acetyl transferase gene wcaF from the CA gene cluster in E. coli K-12 severely curtailed the maturation and development of the complex three-dimensional architecture typically associated with robust biofilms (10Danese P.N. Pratt L.A. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3593-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). CA is a polyanionic heteropolysaccharide containing a repeat unit with d-glucose, l-fucose, d-galactose, and d-glucuronic acid sugars that are nonstoichiometrically decorated with O-acetyl and pyruvate side chains (6Grant W.D. Sutherland I.W. Wilkinson J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 1187-1193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Garegg P.J. Lindberg B. Onn T. Sutherland I.W. Acta Chem. Scand. 1971; 25: 2103-2108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CA polysaccharide repeat is assembled on the membrane lipid undecaprenol pyrophosphate (Und-PP) by a series of glycosyl transferases on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane, after which the single repeat is flipped to the periplasmic side and polymerized by the Wzy-dependent pathway (reviewed in Refs. 1Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3382) Google Scholar and 3Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 39-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the polymer is presumably cleaved from the Und-PP anchor, transported across the periplasm, and excreted into the extracellular space in a poorly understood process. The genetic determinant for CA biosynthesis resides on the 19 gene wca (cps) cluster (12Stevenson G. Andrianopoulos K. Hobbs M. Reeves P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4885-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 13Stout V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is tightly regulated by a complex signal transduction cascade governed by the rcs (regulator of capsule synthesis) phosphorelay system (14Gottesman S. Trisler P. Torres-Cabassa A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Majdalani N. Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 379-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). While normally not expressed in planktonic cultures, a number of suboptimal culture conditions modestly induce the production of CA, including low growth temperatures on solid surfaces, osmotic shock (16Sledjeski D.D. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1204-1206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), desiccation (17Ophir T. Gutnick D.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 740-745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and high concentrations of zinc (18Hagiwara D. Sugiura M. Oshima T. Mori H. Aiba H. Yamashino T. Mizuno T. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5735-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), detergents (19Rajagopal S. Sudarsan N. Nickerson K.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 4117-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), or β-lactams (20Sailer F.C. Meberg B.M. Young K.D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 226: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Low level and transient induction has complicated studies on envelope changes, which accompany CA biosynthesis. In this report, a mutant strain of E. coli K-12 that produces copious quantities of CA when cultured in hypotonic growth medium has been used to isolate a novel LPS glycoform containing CA repeats that we call MLPS (for M-antigen). Further, it is shown that MLPS has a structure differing from the reported structures of extracellular CA and that MLPS, not LPS O-antigen, is the dominant smooth LPS glycoform synthesized when CA is highly induced. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—All strains used were derivatives of E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 and are listed in Table 1. Bacteria were grown in either Luria-Bertani (LB) (10 g/liter Bacto tryptone; 5 g/liter yeast extract) medium containing the indicated amount of NaCl (5 g/liter or 10 g/liter for CA inducing and non-inducing conditions, respectively) or in 0.6% d-glucose MOPS minimal media supplemented with thiamine (1 μg/ml) (21Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were grown aerobically at 37 °C with shaking (250 rpm). To partially restore LPS biosynthesis in the KPM series, 30 μm d-arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) was added along with 10 μm d-glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) to induce the hexose sugar phosphate transporter (22Meredith T.C. Woodard R.W. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6936-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The amino acid analog p-fluorophenylalanine (FPA) was used at 80 μm to induce CA biosynthesis in wild-type strains (23Kang S. Markovitz A. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 584-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmidsStrains/plasmidDescriptionSource or Ref.BW30270E. coli K-12 MG1655; rph+ fnr+ wbbLE. coli Genetic Stock Center (CGSC 7925)F11119-41Wild-type E. coli isolate with O:16 antigen; K1:H-H.

Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar), except chloramphenicol was used at 10 μg/ml for selection, and temperature-sensitive plasmids were cured at 37 °C in ΔAPI strains (KPM designation). Primers H1P1WaaL-H2P2WaaL were used to construct the insert cassette targeting waaL. All strains were colony-purified, tested for loss of all antibiotic resistances, and the relevant locus sequenced to confirm the site of deletion. Both the waaL (WaaLF-WaaLR) and wbbL (WbbLF-WbbLR) genes were amplified and cloned into the expression vector pT7-7 using standard molecular biology techniques and maintained with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Primer sequences are listed in Table S1 of Supplemental Information. Quantitation of CA—CA was estimated according to a published procedure (23Kang S. Markovitz A. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 584-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Liquid cultures were immersed in a boiling water bath for 15 min to release extracellular polysaccharides, and then clarified by centrifugation (10 min, 8000 × g). The supernatant was extensively dialyzed against distilled water before being assayed for ω-deoxyhexose (l-fucose), a constituent of CA, by a colorimetric reaction using authentic l-fucose as standard (25Dische Z. Shettles L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 175: 595-603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CA levels are reported as g of nondialyzable ω-deoxyhexose/unit A600 nm/ml of culture. LPS SDS-PAGE and O:16/ECA Immunoblots—Culture samples for LPS analysis were washed twice with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell pellets resuspended in lysis buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol). LPS samples were separated by Tricine-SDS-PAGE (26Lesse A.J. Campagnari A.A. Bittner W.E. Apicella M.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 126: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and visualized by silver staining (27Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots were developed using either Ab K9-7/75 for the O:16 antigen or mAb 898 for ECA (28Peters H. Jurs M. Jann B. Jann K. Timmis K.N. Bitter-Suermann D. Infect. Immun. 1985; 50: 459-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as previously described (29Meredith T.C. Aggarwal P. Mamat U. Lindner B. Woodard R.W. ACS Chem. Biol. 2006; 1: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Large Scale MLPS Purification—For isolation and purification of MLPS, KPM22 was grown in 10 liters of LB medium (5 g/liter NaCl) supplemented with G6P (10 μm) and A5P (10 μm) at 30 °C with vigorous shaking (250 rpm). After growth of the culture to a density of 1.0 at 600 nm, additional G6P/A5P (10/15 μm) was added and grown until the cell density ceased increasing. At this point, cells were harvested and total LPS extracted as described (29Meredith T.C. Aggarwal P. Mamat U. Lindner B. Woodard R.W. ACS Chem. Biol. 2006; 1: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Purification of Oligosaccharides—Approximately 60 mg of total LPS was hydrolyzed in acetic acid buffer (1.5 m CH3COONa, pH 4.4, 100 °C, 2 h). Lipid A was removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 1 h). The carbohydrate portion (supernatant) was lyophilized, reconstituted, and then fractionated by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) on a TSK-40 HW column (2 cm × 120 cm) using 50 mm pyridine acetate buffer (pH 4.4) as eluent. Fractions were monitored using a differential refractometer. Aliquots of purified oligosaccharides were de-O-acetylated using absolute hydrazine (37 °C, 30 min). Compositional Analysis—The sugar components of the oligosaccharides were identified as methyl glycoside acetate derivatives (2 m HCl in methanol, 85 °C, 16 h, then acetylation). Methylation analysis, the determination of the absolute configurations of the sugar components, and GLC/GLC-MS were performed as previously described (30Haseley S.R. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3206) Google Scholar, 32Kaczynski Z. Karapetyan G.

Res. 1978; 62: 359-362Crossref Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry and NMR Spectroscopy—Mass spectra were recorded in the negative ion mode using a 7 Tesla ESI FT-MS instrument (Bruker ApexII) (29Meredith T.C. Aggarwal P. Mamat U. Lindner B. Woodard R.W. ACS Chem. Biol. 2006; 1: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX Avance 600 MHz spectrometer at 27 °C (34Theilacker C. Kaczynski Z. Kropec A. Fabretti F. Sange T. Holst O. Huebner J. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 5703-5712Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Hypotonic Media Cause Growth Inhibition, CA Induction, and an Altered LPS Profile in KPM22—E. coli K-12 has two copies of the A5P isomerase (API) gene (22Meredith T.C. Woodard R.W. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6936-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Meredith T.C. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32771-32777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whose product (A5P) is a precursor of the inner LPS core moiety 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo). Strain KPM22 was constructed by deleting both API genes, resulting in an LPS layer containing predominantly the nonglycosylated LPS intermediate lipid IVA (29Meredith T.C. Aggarwal P. Mamat U. Lindner B. Woodard R.W. ACS Chem. Biol. 2006; 1: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Despite having a markedly compromised OM, KPM22 is normally nonmucoid and has only a 50% longer doubling time (29Meredith T.C. Aggarwal P. Mamat U. Lindner B. Woodard R.W. ACS Chem. Biol. 2006; 1: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Lowering the NaCl concentration, however, revealed a salt-dependent mucoid phenotype on agar and a decrease in growth that could be suppressed by complementation with the plasmid encoded API gene kdsD (KPM25) (Fig. 1A). At an NaCl concentration of 5 g/liter (∼85 mm), the mucoid phenotype was readily apparent while the growth density was not appreciably diminished, and was thus used as the CA-inducing conditions in subsequent studies. The mucoid phenotype is a characteristic marker of CA induction (6Grant W.D. Sutherland I.W. Wilkinson J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 1187-1193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm CA is induced by hypotonic media in KPM22, extracellular polysaccharides were isolated and assayed for nondialyzable ω-deoxyhexose content, which is representative of the amount of the CA carbohydrate l-fucose (23Kang S. Markovitz A. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 584-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 10 g/liter NaCl (∼170 mm), KPM22 produced low amounts of CA comparable to the wild-type strain BW30270 (Fig. 1B). However, growth in 5 g/liter NaCl significantly increased the amount of nondialyzable ω-deoxyhexose, indicating lower ionic strength medium induces CA in KPM22. A similar, though more modest, increase in CA production was observed in the wild-type genetic background by adding the CA-inducing amino acid analog FPA to the growth medium. FPA is believed to induce CA production by inactivating a regulatory protein after it is incorporated into the polypeptide chain (23Kang S. Markovitz A. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 584-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SDS-PAGE LPS profile was examined to determine whether CA induction is accompanied by changes to the LPS core of KPM22. When preparations were isolated from hypotonic media, a distinct ladder-like banding of high molecular mass LPS species of unknown composition was readily observed (Fig. 1C). As many as 8–10 additional bands with a staining intensity inversely proportional to size were observed, presumably reflecting the presence of a novel LPS glycoconjugate differing in the number of polysaccharide repeat units. MLPS Is Dependent on CA Induction and a Complete K-12 LPS Core—By adding A5P and lowering the concentration of NaCl in the growth medium, both the LPS core and CA synthesis, respectively, in KPM22 can be systematically varied and their involvement in the production of the new banding pattern evaluated. High molecular mass bands were observed only when A5P was added to hypotonic medium (Fig. 2A, lane 4). FPA could be used in place of hypotonic medium to induce CA in KPM22 cultures, resulting in the appearance of high molecular mass bands (Fig. 2A, lane 7). Addition of FPA to wild type resulted in similar LPS banding patterns (lane 2), suggesting the extra bands are not particular to the KPM22 genetic background. As a fraction of ECA is known to be ligated to the LPS core to form ECALPS (2Kuhn H.M. Meier-Dieter U. Mayer H. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 4: 195-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ECA immunoblots were performed to exclude the possibility of ECALPS being the unknown LPS glycoconjugate. Whereas the ECA Ab did detect bands, they did not correspond to the CA-dependent silver stainable bands (Fig. 2B). Because the unknown glycoconjugate required both a complete K-12 LPS core and CA induction, the bands were tentatively identified as MLPS. Compositional Analysis of MLPS Oligosaccharide (OS) Fractions—Four OS fractions (OS-I to -IV) were isolated after hydrolysis and separation by gel permeation chromatography and subsequently analyzed by high-resolution ESI FT-ICR MS (Fig. 3. Detailed mass assignments can be found under Supplemental Information, Table S2). Fractions OS-III (4.0 mg) and OS-IV (8.7 mg) mainly contained the unligated OS of LPS glycoform I with non-stoichiometric P and P-EtN substitutions (36Muöller-Loennies S. Lindner B. Brade H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34090-34101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 37Holst O. Zaöhringer U. Brade H. Zamojski A. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 215: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Molecular ion peaks were observed for fractions OS-II (5.5 mg) and OS-I (2.2 mg) that are in excellent agreement with the calculated masses of OS-III/IV ligated to either one or two CA repeat units, respectively. Fraction OS-I also contained molecular species lacking one pyruvate unit. Approximately ∼30% (mol percent) of the total recovered LPS-derived oligosaccharides were modified with CA repeats. Carbohydrate analysis of OS-II identified Glc, Gal, Hep, and Fuc as the main constituents and smaller amounts of GlcA and Pyr-Gal. The absolute configurations were assigned as l for Fuc residues and d for the other sugars. Methylation analysis of OS-II revealed the presence of 4,6-disubstituted Gal, 4-substituted GlcA, 3-substituted Gal, 3-substituted Fuc, 4-substituted Fuc, and 3-substituted Glc, as well as all of the constituents of the standard E. coli K-12 LPS structure, glycoform I (36Muöller-Loennies S. Lindner B. Brade H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34090-34101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). OS-III also contained all the constituents of glycoform I, along with a minor amount of 7-substituted Hep, as described earlier as the linkage point of a terminal β-GlcpNAc residue in LPS glycoform II (36Muöller-Loennies S. Lindner B. Brade H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34090-34101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The increased ratio of 7-substituted Hep to terminal Hep in OS-II in comparison to OS-III implicated O-7 Hep as the candidate CA-LPS core linkage position. NMR Spectroscopy of OS-II—A comprehensive NMR investigation of OS-II was undertaken to confirm the structure and determine the CA linkage position to the LPS core. To facilitate peak assignments, a portion of OS-II was de-O-acetylated and analyzed in tandem with the parent oligosaccharide. The 1H NMR spectrum of OS-II contained approximately a dozen overlapping signals in the anomeric region between δ 5.454 and δ 4.440, three signals of O-acetyl methyl groups, of a pyruvate methyl group, and several overlapping signals characteristic of 6-deoxy-sugar methyl groups (Fig. 4, A and B). HMQC analysis helped to deconvolute the overlapping signals in the anomeric region (data not shown). In total, seventeen anomeric proton signals were resolved along with three proton signals shifted downfield because of geminal O-acetylation (δ 5.227, δ 5.083, δ 4.910). Three of the anomeric proton signals (labeled D, E, and F in OS-II structure (Fig. 7)) gave rise to two signals attributed to non-stoichiometric O-2/O-3 acetylation of residue E. Anomeric configurations and monosaccharide conformations (pyranose for all residues) were assigned on the basis of 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts and 3JH-1,H-2 and 1JC-1,H-1 coupling constants (tabulated lists of NMR assignments can be found under Supplemental Information, Tables S3 and S4).FIGURE 7Chemical structure of OS-II isolated from the total LPS fraction of E. coli KPM22 grown in hypotonic medium after hydrolysis and removal of lipid A. Non-stoichiometric substitutions are underlined and italicized. Letter assignments correspond to peak assignments in the text and in Fig. 4. The large block arrow denotes ligation position of the initiating d-Glc residue from the CA repeat to LPS core.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The 31P NMR spectrum had four phosphate signals, with the most prominent resonance being assigned to a monophosphate residue attached to O-4 of the 3,7-disubstituted α-Hepp (M (δ 0.70)). A second residue was linked to O-4 of 3-substituted α-Hepp (O (δ 1.09)) and was non-stoichiometrically substituted by a 2-aminoethanol phosphate appendage (δ – 10.89 and δ – 11.60). The protons of three O-acetyl methyl groups were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum in a ratio of ∼1:0.5:0.5. Residue C (3-substituted α-Galp) was stoichiometrically O-acetylated at position O-2 whereas residue E (4-substituted α-Fucp) was either substituted by O-acetyl groups at positions O-2 or O-3. The HMBC spectrum showed H-6 protons of two different Fuc residues (substituted and unsubstituted at position O-4), one of which had multiple signals because of non-stoichiometric O-acetylation (Fig. 5). On the basis of methylation analysis and NMR data (38Garegg P.J. Jansson P-E. Lindberg B. Lindh F. Loönngren J. Kvarnstroöm I. Nimmich W. Carbohydr. Res. 1980; 78: 127-132Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the R-configured pyruvate residues were located to O-4 and O-6 of 4,6-disubstituted α-Galp (A). Additionally, a carbon resonance at δ 63.68 was observed, which is typical for C-5 of an α-Galp residue bearing a pyruvic ketal substituent at O-4 and O-6 (39Jansson P-E. Lindberg J. Widmalm G. Acta Chem. Scand. 1993; 47: 711-715Crossref Google Scholar). An HSQC-DEPT experiment was performed to distinguish between secondary and primary carbon atoms. Two low-field shielded cross-peaks of primary C-7 of 7-substituted Hepp (G) at δC,H 3.856/73.07 and at δC,H 4.057/73.07 were observed. The presence/absence of these signals has been previously described for different glycoforms of the core region depending on a substitution at O-7 (36Muöller-Loennies S. Lindner B. Brade H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34090-34101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The positions of glycosylation assigned by methylation analysis were confirmed by the low field shifted signals of carbon atoms (underlined values in Tables S3 and S4 of Supplemental Information). ROESY experiments revealed the sequence of the sugar residues in the oligosaccharide (Fig. 6). Strong inter-residual NOE contacts were observed between protons A1/B4, B1/C3, B1/C4, C1/D3, D1/E4, E1/F3, F1/G7, G1/H6, H1/I2, I1/K3, and K1/M3 unequivocally confirming the proposed structure shown in Fig. 7. One of these NOE contacts, namely H-1 (δ 4.440 or δ 4.493) of residue F (3-substituted β-Glcp) and H-7 (δ 3.856) of residue G (7-substituted α-Hepp), identified the substitution position of the core region by the CA repeat unit. WaaL Is Necessary for CA Ligation to the LPS Core—Because the LPS core substitution positions of both CA and the O:16 antigen are identical (40Feldman M.F. Marolda C.L. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Parodi A.J. Valvano M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35129-35138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and may thus share the same LPS core acceptor, the role of the O:16 antigen ligase WaaL in MLPS biosynthesis was investigated. Isogenic constructs with the waaL gene deleted were made in both wild type and KPM22 backgrounds. Deletion of waaL had no appreciable affect on the LPS profiles in a wild type (TCM31) or KPM22 genetic background (KPM72) under conditions that did not induce CA synthesis in comparison to their respective isogenic waaL+ parent strains (Fig. 8A). When CA was induced, the K-12 LPS core remained the only observable band (lanes 2 and 5). Complementation with plasmid-encoded waaL restored MLPS biosynthesis to wild-type levels (TCM33 and KPM73), indicating CA is dependent upon the WaaL O-antigen ligase for linkage to the LPS core. MLPS Is the Dominant Conjugated LPS Glycoform during CA Induction—E. coli K-12 has an IS5 insertion within wbbL, a l-rhamnosyl transferase from the O-antigen gene cluster (41Liu D. Reeves P.R.

https://openalex.org/W2007187478,"Proteolytic degradation of elastic fibers is associated with a broad spectrum of pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis and pulmonary emphysema. We have studied the interaction between elastins and human cysteine cathepsins K, L, and S, which are known to participate in elastinolytic activity in vivo. The enzymes showed distinctive preferences in degrading elastins from bovine neck ligament, aorta, and lung. Different susceptibility of these elastins to proteolysis was attributed to morphological differences observed by scanning electron microscopy. Kinetics of cathepsin binding to the insoluble substrate showed that the process occurs in two steps. The enzyme is initially adsorbed on the elastin surface in a nonproductive manner and then rearranges to form a catalytically competent complex. In contrast, soluble elastin is bound directly in a catalytically productive manner. Studies of enzyme partitioning between the phases showed that cathepsin K favors adsorption on elastin; cathepsin L prefers the aqueous environment, and cathepsin S is equally distributed among both phases. Our results suggest that elastinolysis by cysteine cathepsins proceeds in cycles of enzyme adsorption, binding of a susceptible peptide moiety, hydrolysis, and desorption. Alternatively, the enzyme may also form a new catalytic complex without prior desorption and re-adsorption. In both cases the active center of the enzymes remains at least partly accessible to inhibitors. Elastinolytic activity was readily abolished by cystatins, indicating that, unlike enzymes such as leukocyte elastase, pathological elastinolytic cysteine cathepsins might represent less problematic drug targets. In contrast, thyropins were relatively inefficient in preventing elastinolysis by cysteine cathepsins.

Elastic fibers are the key extracellular matrix component conferring elasticity to tissues such as blood vessels, lungs, and skin. The fibers are composed of a rubber-like network of highly stable and hydrophobic polymers of the protein elastin, associated with peripheral microfibrils (1Rosenbloom J. Lab. Investig. 1984; 51: 605-623PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kielty C.M. Sherratt M.J. Shuttleworth C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2817-2828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolytic degradation of elastic fibers leads to loss of tissue elasticity, which is associated with the development of different pathological conditions. A large repertoire of elastinolytic peptidases has been identified in human cells and tissues, including enzymes from four of the five catalytic classes of peptidases. The molecular mechanism underlying the process of elastinolysis has been thoroughly studied for human leukocyte elastase (HLE) 2The abbreviations used are: HLE, human leukocyte elastase; Tg1 domain, thyroglobulin type 1 domain; SSA, specific surface area; DTT, dithiothreitol. 2The abbreviations used are: HLE, human leukocyte elastase; Tg1 domain, thyroglobulin type 1 domain; SSA, specific surface area; DTT, dithiothreitol.

Extracellular matrix degradation by monocyte-derived macrophages is because of the action of serine peptidases, matrix metalloproteases, and papain-like cysteine peptidases (cysteine cathepsins) (13Punturieri A.

In inflammation, macrophages were found to secrete cathepsins B, K, L, and S, which were also identified as major contributors to tissue damage in chronic inflammatory conditions (13Punturieri A.

Numerous studies have implicated cathepsins K, L, and S, as well as some others, in extensive degradation of elastic fibers, which accompanies the development of pathological conditions of the cardiovascular system. In mice, cathepsin S was found to co-localize with regions of increased elastin breakdown in atherosclerotic plaques (22Rodgers K.J. Watkins D.J. Miller A.L. Chan P.Y. Karanam S. Brissette W.H.

In human atheroma, cathepsins S and K were up-regulated in macrophages as well as smooth muscle cells (26Sukhova G.K. Shi G.P. Simon D.I. Chapman H.A. Libby P. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 576-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, and increased cathepsin S levels were detected in sera of patients suffering from atherosclerosis and diabetes (27Liu J. Ma L.

Human macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques were shown to degrade elastin extracellularly as well as intracellularly. Cathepsins K and S were attributed major roles in extracellular degradation, whereas cathepsin V was identified as the major peptidase involved in lysosomal digestion (20Yasuda Y. Li Z. Greenbaum D.

Increased levels of cathepsins K, S, and V were also observed in stenotic aortic valves (28Helske S. Syvaranta S. Lindstedt K.A. Lappalainen J. Oorni K. Mayranpaa M.I. Lommi J. Turto H. Werkkala K.

Kruger S. Kohnlein T. Broömme D. Reinhold D. Ansorge S. Welte T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Increased cathepsin L activity was observed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of smokers (33Takahashi H. Ishidoh K. Muno D. Ohwada A. Nukiwa T. Kominami E. Kira S. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1993; 147: 1562-1568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and increased levels of cathepsins B, H, K, L, and S were observed in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (34Altiok O. Yasumatsu R. Bingol-Karakoc G.

In vivo, proteolytic activity of cysteine cathepsins is regulated by endogenous inhibitors, including the general cysteine cathepsin inhibitors cystatins (35Barrett A.J. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1986; 45: 1363-1374PubMed Google Scholar), the more specific thyropins (36Lenarčič B. Bevec T. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 105-111PubMed Google Scholar), and several others. The importance of the peptidase/inhibitor balance has been well investigated in tumor progression (reviewed in Ref. 37Skrzydlewska E. Sulkowska M. Koda M. Sulkowski S. World J. Gastroenterol. 2005; 11: 1251-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Reduced cystatin C levels have also been observed in atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysm in human and mouse (38Shi G.P.

Nilsson J. Jovinge S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Yasumatsu R. Bingol-Karakoc G. Riese R.J. Stahlman M.T. Dwyer W. Pierce R.A. Broömme D. Weber E. Cataltepe S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2006; 173: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In existing reports on the elastinolytic activity of cysteine cathepsins, the mechanism utilized by these peptidases to degrade elastin has not yet been investigated. In this work, we have studied the interaction between elastin and the human cathepsins K, L, and S, which have been most frequently implicated in extracellular elastinolysis. Because the structural organization of elastic fibers differs between tissues, we used bovine elastins from three different sources as follows: aorta, lung, and neck ligament. We investigated the mode of cathepsin binding to elastin, the overall elastinolytic activity, and the effect of macromolecular inhibitors from the cystatin and thyropin families on the elastinolytic activity of cysteine cathepsins. Elastins, Enzymes, and Inhibitors—All elastin types were purchased from Elastin Products Co., Inc. The elastins used in this study were all of bovine origin as follows: neck ligament elastin (number E70; particle size, 100–400 mesh), aortic elastin (number SB87; particle size, pass 100 mesh), lung elastin (number SB77; particle size, pass 100 mesh), and ETNA-elastin (number E60; prepared from neck ligament, salt-free, water-soluble). Recombinant human cathepsin K (EC 3.4.22.38), cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15), and cathepsin S (EC 3.4.22.27) were produced in Escherichia coli according to published procedures (41Dolinar M. Maganja D.B. Turk V. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 42Kopitar G. Dolinar M. ŝtrukelj B. Pungerčar J. Turk V. Eur. J.

Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Active concentrations of all enzymes were determined by active site titrations with the irreversible inhibitor E-64 (Bachem, Switzerland). Recombinant human stefin A was produced according to Ref. 44Pol E. Olsson S.L. Estrada S. Prasthofer T.W. Bjork I. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, and the cystatin-like domain 3 of human kininogen (kininogen domain 3) was isolated as described previously (45Lenarčič B. Kraŝovec M. Ritonja A. Olafsson I. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and recombinant thyroglobulin type 1 (Tg1) domain of human testican-1 as described previously (46Meh P. Pavŝič M. Turk V. Baici A. Lenarčič B. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The recombinant human p41 fragment of the major histocompatibility complex class II-associated invariant chain, recombinant Tg1 domain of human nidogen-1, and recombinant Tg1 domain 1 of human nidogen-2 were produced in-house. In brief, cDNA sequences coding for individual Tg1 domains were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pET-32b(+) expression vector (Novagen, Germany) using the NcoI and XhoI restriction sites. Soluble thioredoxin fusion proteins were then expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen, Germany) at 37 °C. Fusion proteins were purified from cell lysates by immobilized nickel ion-affinity chromatography. The Tg1 domains were liberated from the fusion proteins by enterokinase cleavage and purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Samples were over 95% pure as visualized by SDS-PAGE. Active p41 fragment concentration was determined by active site titration of cathepsin L, and the concentrations of the nidogen Tg1 domains were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. Elastin Surface Area Determination and Scanning Electron Microscopy—The specific surface area (SSA) of solid and powdered elastins was measured by nitrogen adsorption at –196 °C using the Brunauer et al. theory (47Brunauer S. Emmett P.H. Teller E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1938; 60: 309-319Crossref Scopus (21238) Google Scholar) (BET-method, Tristar, Micrometrics Inc, Gemini, The Netherlands). An eight point isotherm, 0.02 < p/p0 < 0.2), was used after degassing the samples at room temperature for 1 h. The morphology of the elastin samples was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy using a LEO 1530 Gemini (Oberkochen, Germany). Kinetic Measurements—Binding of cathepsins to insoluble elastin was studied using an approach originally developed for describing the interaction of HLE with macromolecular substrates (9Baici A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1040: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). With this method the hydrolysis of a low molecular mass fluorogenic substrate (called the reporter substrate) is measured in the presence of various amounts of a macromolecular substrate. In the assay, the enzyme is partitioned between the macromolecular substrate and the reporter substrate, and the perturbation caused by the macromolecular substrate to the kinetics of reporter substrate hydrolysis can be formally treated as that of an inhibitor. Kinetic measurements were performed in a C-61 fluorimeter (Photon Technology International) at 25 °C. Assays with cathepsins K and L were performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.50, containing 2.5 mm EDTA and using the fluorogenic substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Bachem, Switzerland). In cathepsin K assays, the final concentration of the reporter substrate was 5 μm (Km = 7.5 μm), and in cathepsin L assays the concentration was 10 μm (Km = 0.93 μm). Assays with cathepsin S were performed in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.50, containing 2.5 mm EDTA and 0.1% PEG-6000, with benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Val-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin as the substrate (Bachem, Switzerland) at a final concentration of 10 μm (Km = 12.5 μm). Active enzyme concentrations in the assays were 60 pm for cathepsin K, 200 pm for cathepsin L, and 2 nm for cathepsin S. Variable amounts of elastin powder (ranging from 0.2 to 15 mg) were introduced into disposable 10 × 10-mm acryl cuvettes. 2 ml of the appropriate assay buffer were added to the powder, and the cuvette was then hermetically sealed and incubated overnight at room temperature. Immediately prior to the experiment, the mixture was supplemented with the appropriate substrate and DTT (final concentration 2.5 mm). Reaction was started by addition of the enzyme, and the progress was monitored continuously for 3 min at λex = 383 nm and λem = 455 nm. To minimize light scattering, narrow excitation and emission bandwidths of 1 nm were used. During the assay the reaction mixture was continuously stirred using a built-in magnetic stirrer and a Teflon-coated stirring rod to avoid sedimentation of the insoluble material. Assays with soluble ETNA-elastin were performed under the conditions described above. A stock elastin solution (10 mg/ml) was prepared by dissolving ETNA-elastin in the appropriate assay buffer and diluted immediately prior to the experiment. Kinetic Models for Cathepsin Binding to Elastins—To describe the binding of cysteine cathepsins to the surface of insoluble elastin, we propose three models of interaction, which are shown in Fig. 1. The three models and their corresponding equations are described with terminology and dimensions typical of interfacial enzyme catalysis, with the asterisk denoting processes occurring at the surface of insoluble elastin (48Berg O.G. Jain M.K. Interfacial Enzyme Kinetics. 2002; (John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK): 47-75Google Scholar). A*M and K* represents the elastin surface area per unit volume and the interfacial dissociation constant, respectively, both with dimensions m2·liter–1; [S] is the molar concentration of the reporter substrate, and Km is its Michaelis constant. The models consist of two parts as follows: the upper parts represent the Michaelis-Menten path of reporter substrate hydrolysis, and the lower parts represent the adsorption of the enzyme to the matrix, followed by a catalytic step, which is shown in Fig. 1 as dashed boxes in each model. This part is not visible in the assays, because the elastin cleavage products (Q) are deprived of a spectroscopically measurable signal. Therefore, the macromolecular substrate can be formally regarded as a competitive inhibitor, and the measured “inhibition constant” of the macromolecular substrate (M) actually yields an analogous of the Michaelis constant. However, by using low enzyme concentrations and short reaction times, we can safely assume that the perturbation on the formation of the fluorescent product (P) caused by M yields a good estimate of the dissociation constant K*. In Model 1 the behavior of the macromolecular substrate is analogous to that of a linear competitive inhibitor and corresponds to enzyme adsorption to the matrix in a nonproductive manner followed by isomerization to a catalytically productive complex. The treatment of Models 2 and 3 is analogous to that of a competitive inhibitor, two molecules of which bind the enzyme in an ordered sequence. Model 3 differs from Model 2 by a dimensionless coefficient a that multiplies K* and describes a change of the dissociation constant for the vacant site following the adsorption step, thus taking into account the cooperativity of the binding process. In Fig. 1, Model 1 is described by Equation 1, which is equivalent to the equation for linear competitive inhibition; Model 2 is described by Equation 2, and for Model 3 Equation 3 applies. The interaction of cathepsins with soluble ETNA-elastin was analyzed using the same models, except that elastin surface area per unit volume (A*M) was replaced by mass concentration [M] in the corresponding equations, and the interface equilibrium dissociation constant K*, used to describe the adsorption of cathepsins to the surface of insoluble elastin, was replaced by the equilibrium dissociation constant in solution K (given in g·liter–1). Discrimination between the models was performed by fitting the corresponding Equations 1–3 in Fig. 1 to experimental data using GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego. First, Equation 1 was fitted to the data, and the runs test was performed to check any systematic deviation of the fitted curve from the data. If there was no systematic deviation, a discrimination test was performed by analysis of variance of the difference between the sum of squares of Models 1 and 2 (extra sum-of-squares test). An F ratio and a p value were calculated as follows: for a p value less than 0.05, the more complicated model (Model 2) was chosen as appropriate. If fitting of Equation 1 did not pass the runs test, discrimination was performed with the extra-sum-of squares test applied to Model 2 and Model 3. An additional tool for interpreting the kinetics of cathepsin binding to elastin was the 90:10 ratio (A*M,0.9/A*M,0.1), i.e. the ratio of elastin surface areas necessary to reduce enzyme activity by 90 and 10%. For Model 1, the 90:10 ratio is always 81 (Equation 4), a characteristic of linear competitive inhibitors (49Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. 1975; (Wiley Interscience, New York): 106Google Scholar). For Model 2, the 90:10 ratio depends on the [S]/Km ratio (Equation 5), and for Model 3 it depends on the values of [S]/Km and a (see Equation 6). Elastinolytic Assays—The elastinolytic activities of cathepsins K, L, and S were measured using a modified procedure of Schwabe (50Schwabe C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 484-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In brief, reaction mixtures containing 1.0 mg of insoluble elastin in a total volume of 200 μl of the appropriate assay buffer supplemented with 2.5 mm DTT (see under “Kinetic Measurements”) were prepared. Reactions were started by addition of the enzyme and incubated in an Eppendorf Thermomixer Compact at 37 °C with shaking (1200 rpm) to avoid sedimentation. Enzyme concentrations in the assays were 285 nm cathepsin K, 100 nm cathepsin L, and 100 nm cathepsin S. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 10–120 min, and the reactions then stopped by addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5% (w/v). The samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g, and 100 μl of clear supernatant were added to 3.0 ml of 0.2 m sodium borate buffer, pH 8.5, and then combined with 1.0 ml of a fluorescamine solution (15 mg/100 ml in acetone) under vigorous stirring. The fluorescence of the labeled peptides was measured at λex = 390 nm and λem = 480 nm. Appropriate blanks were run to take into account the fluorescence developed by elastin and enzyme alone. The measured fluorescence was compared with a standard curve, which was produced using glycine solutions of known concentrations. The rate of peptide release from elastin was determined as the slope of the curve obtained from multiple samples incubated for increasing periods of time and was then normalized to 1 pmol of enzyme. Adsorption of Cathepsins on Elastin—The adsorption of cathepsins K, L, and S on elastin was studied by a modified procedure of Ying and Simon (12Ying Q.L. Simon S.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The partitioning of the enzyme between the insoluble phase (elastin) and soluble phase (aqueous buffer) was studied in the presence of excess amounts of elastin to allow for concentration-independent adsorption of the enzyme. In brief, 100 μl of an elastin suspension (10 mg/ml) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.50, containing 2.5 mm EDTA and 2.5 mm DTT, was incubated with each cathepsin (concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 μm) for 10 min at 25 °C and with shaking to avoid sedimentation. The samples were then centrifuged for 3 min at 14,000 × g, and the enzymatic activity of the supernatant was measured fluorimetrically as described under “Kinetic Measurements.” In parallel, control samples without elastin were run and were used to calculate the percentage of enzyme adsorbed to the elastin surface. Inhibition of Elastinolysis—The proteinaceous inhibitors used in this study were recombinant stefin A, kininogen domain 3, Tg1 domain of testican-1, the p41 fragment, Tg1 domain of nidogen-1, and Tg1 domain 1 of nidogen-2. Experiments were performed as described under “Elastinolytic Assays,” except that inhibitors were added to the mixture either prior to addition of the enzyme or following a 30-min preincubation of the enzyme with elastin. All samples were incubated for a total of 60 min, and released peptides then detected by reacting them with fluorescamine as described under “Elastinolytic Assays.” Appropriate blanks were run to account for fluorescence of elastin, enzyme, and inhibitor alone. SSA and Microscopic Analysis of Elastin Particles—Bovine elastins from three different anatomical regions were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy to verify their morphological features as a support to the interpretation of our kinetic measurements (Fig. 2). Neck ligament elastin appeared predominantly as extended patches, or splinters thereof, with a rough surface, which was spotted by small fragments plausibly generated during extraction from the tissue and sample preparation (Fig. 2C). These small fragments are likely to substantially contribute to the SSA of neck ligament elastin (2.3 m2/g). In contrast, lung elastin showed a distinct three-dimensional network composed of bundles of fibers (Fig"

Whether this response represents simple hyperplasia of various liver elements or requires recapitulation of the genetic program of the developing liver is not known. To study these possibilities, we examined transcriptional programs of adult liver after partial hepatectomy and contrasted these with developing embryonic liver. Principal component analysis demonstrated that the time series of gene expression during liver regeneration does not segregate according to developmental transcription patterns. Gene ontology analysis revealed that liver restoration after hepatectomy and liver development differ dramatically with regard to transcription factors and chromatin structure modification. In contrast, the tissues are similar with regard to proliferation-associated genes. Consistent with these findings, real-time polymerase chain reaction showed transcription factors known to be important in liver development are not induced during liver regeneration. These three lines of evidence suggest that at a transcriptional level restoration of liver mass after injury is best described as hepatocyte hyperplasia and not true regeneration.

We speculate this novel pattern of gene expression may underlie the unique capacity of the liver to repair itself after injury. The ability of the adult mammalian liver to restore its function and mass after injury is unique among organs. In tissues with only limited repair potential, including the bone and kidney, developmentally important genetic pathways are co-opted during healing (1Vortkamp A. Pathi S. Peretti G.M. Caruso E.M.

Possibilities include that liver repair does not recapitulate pathways of embryonic morphogenesis or that the liver can reproduce embryonic signaling pathways more effectively than other tissues. Transcriptional profiling and advances in quantitative biology can distinguish these possibilities and shed light on the mechanism of liver repair. Transcription factors play central roles in liver repair and development. Reconstitution of liver mass after injury requires c-Jun, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), 4The abbreviations used are: STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; PCA, principal components analysis; LCB, lower confidence bound; QRT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time PCR; GO, gene ontology; PC1, first principal component; PC2, second principal component; EASE, Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer; dpc, days post-conception; HNF-1β, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1β.

In contrast, many transcription factors required for liver development are more tissue- and role-specific. Homeobox factors, including Hlx and prospero-related homeobox 1, are required for normal hepatic growth and hepatoblast migration into the septum transversum mesenchyme, respectively (7Hentsch B. Lyons I. Li R. Hartley L. Lints T.J. Adams J.M. Harvey R.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 8Sosa-Pineda B. Wigle J.T. Oliver G. Nat.

Babinet C. Pontoglio M. Yaniv M. Barra J. Development. 2002; 129: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of Forkhead Box (Fox) transcription factors A1 and A2 results in failure of hepatic specification (10Lee C.S. Friedman J.R. Fulmer J.T. Kaestner K.H. Nature. 2005; 435: 944-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Hepatoblast mitosis and intrahepatic bile duct formation require Fox M1 (11Krupczak-Hollis K. Wang X. Kalinichenko V.V.

Finally, liver development depends on transcription factors thought to modulate large-scale transcriptional programs, such as hairy and enhancer of split 1 (Hes1) (12Sumazaki R. Shiojiri N. Isoyama S. Masu M. Keino-Masu K. Osawa M. Nakauchi H. Kageyama R. Matsui A. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To better understand the transcriptional mechanisms at work during these processes, multiple groups have presented array analysis on both regenerating and developing liver. Interestingly, these studies have identified relatively few transcription factors regulated during either process. During the first 4 h after hepatectomy in the mouse, only 11 transcription factors were up-regulated during regeneration among 6500 genes examined (13Su A.I. Guidotti L.G. Pezacki J.P. Chisari F.V. Schultz P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11181-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the rat, regeneration was associated with induction of only one transcription factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (14Fukuhara Y. Hirasawa A. Li X.K. Kawasaki M. Fujino M. Funeshima N. Katsuma S. Shiojima S. Yamada M. Okuyama T. Suzuki S. Tsujimoto G. J. Hepatol. 2003; 38: 784-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Another extensive microarray analysis examining networks active during liver regeneration revealed a dramatic shift toward genes involved in cytoskeleton assembly and DNA synthesis; in contrast, no shift toward genes involving transcription was identified (15White P. Brestelli J.E. Kaestner K.H. Greenbaum L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3715-3722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Similar studies of embryonic liver identified relatively few transcription factors specific to each stage (16Arai M. Yokosuka O. Chiba T. Imazeki F. Kato M. Hashida J. Ueda Y. Sugano S. Hashimoto K.

Hepatology. 2002; 35: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In studies designed to censor genes not specific to hepatocytes, plated embryonic liver tissue demonstrated only 281 up-regulated genes on an array of nearly 9000 transcripts as hepatocytes matured (19Petkov P.M. Zavadil J. Goetz D. Chu T. Carver R. Rogler C.E. Bottinger E.P. Shafritz D.A. Dabeva M.D. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Of these, only 12 were related to transcription or regulation of transcription. To elucidate the molecular similarities between regenerating and developing liver, we performed high density microarray analysis of ∼45,000 targets at 1, 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 48, and 72 h after partial hepatectomy and at 10.5, 11.5, 12.5, 13.5, 14.5, and 16.5 days post-conception (dpc). Combining principal component analysis, gene ontology (GO) assignments, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) of selected genes, a picture of liver regeneration at the molecular level emerges and allows determination of the extent to which regeneration recapitulates embryogenesis. Mice—All experiments used CD-1 mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) or our own breeding colony. Animals were maintained in a pathogen-free facility administered by Harvard Medical School in accordance with the institutional guidelines of Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. 2/3 Hepatectomy—Mouse protocols were consistent with National Institutes of Health guidelines and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Harvard Medical School. Female CD-1 mice were operated on at 10 weeks of age. After anesthesia with 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine, the abdomen was prepped with alcohol and betadyne. After midline laparotomy, the tip of the xiphoid was resected and the liver exteriorized. A silk tie was placed around the three anterior lobes of the liver, including the gallbladder, and the 2/3 hepatectomy with cholecystectomy was completed. The liver was returned to the abdominal cavity and the abdomen closed in two layers. Post-operative analgesia consisted of buprenorphine 0.05–0.1 mg/kg twice daily for 48 h or until sacrifice. At harvest, mice were sacrificed with carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation. Embryo Harvest—Pregnant CD-1 females were sacrificed with carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation. The abdomen was opened and the uterus removed. After removal of the uterine musculature, embryos were removed from the yolk sacs and livers micro-dissected, taking care to remove all extraneous tissue including the retrohepatic vena cava. A maximum of 5 min was allowed to elapse between sacrifice and liver harvest to prevent RNA degradation and transcriptional changes. RNA Isolation—All tissue samples were placed into an RNA stabilization reagent (RNAlater; Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Total RNA was isolated from tissue homogenate with a commercial kit (RNeasy Protect mini kit; Qiagen Inc.). Quantitation and assessment of RNA purity was determined by UV absorbance and electrophoresis. Samples were discarded if they did not have a strong 28 S band at least twice the intensity of the 18 S band or if there was significant smearing of the sample. Microarray Analysis—Transcription profiles were determined using Affymetrix MG 430 2.0 chips according to previously described protocols for total RNA extraction and purification, cDNA synthesis, in vitro transcription to produce biotin-labeled cRNA, hybridization of cRNA to the chips, and scanning of image output files (20Jones J. Otu H. Spentzos D. Kolia S. Inan M. Beecken W.D. Fellbaum C. Gu X. Joseph M. Pantuck A.J. Jonas D. Libermann T.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 5730-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Each experimental time point is represented by two separate samples, each consisting of at least three pooled tissues from different animals. For example, six hepatectomies were performed for the 1-h post-hepatectomy time point. The first three were pooled into one sample, and the remaining three were pooled into a second sample. Each sample was run on a separate Affymetrix MG 430 2.0 chip containing over 45,000 transcripts using the two-cycle cDNA synthesis method that contains one round of in vitro transcription cRNA amplification according to the manufacturer's instructions. Scanned array images were analyzed by dChip (21Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar) (www.dchip.org), as it is more robust than Affymetrix software Microarray Analysis Suite 5.0 and Robust Multiarray Average in signal calculation (22Barash Y. Dehan E. Krupsky M. Franklin W. Geraci M. Friedman N. Kaminski N. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Raw probe-level data were normalized using the smoothing spline invariant set method (21Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar). Signal values that represent the expression levels of the transcripts were then obtained using the model-based expression algorithm following the perfect match (PM)-mismatch (MM) difference model described in dChip (21Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar). Briefly, a single signal value is obtained for each transcript based on the difference between the intensity of the PM and MM signals. This value is normalized to the overall intensity of the chip determined by an iterative algorithm that identifies transcripts that are not differentially expressed as opposed to defining them a priori. In this way, the signal value corresponds to an absolute level of expression of the transcript. Analysis of this oligo-based array is therefore different from the analysis of a cDNA array. These normalized and modeled signal values were used in subsequent clustering and differential expression analysis. During the calculation of model-based expression values, single, array, and probe outliers are interrogated, and image spikes are treated as single outliers. If the absolute residual (the difference between the model-fitted value and observed value) of a probe exceeds three times the 80th percentile of absolute residual values of all probes on a chip, it is called a single outlier. Array outliers are the probe pair sets on a chip whose values are different from the consensus probe response pattern (for that particular probe pair set) seen in most chips. If the model-based standard error of a probe pair is three times larger than the median standard error of all probe pairs, it is called a probe-outlier. In the dChip analysis, array outliers are not treated as missing expression values and no truncation on signal values is applied. A chip is marked as an “outlier” if probe, single, or array outlier percentage exceeds a preset threshold. Using the default threshold values (5%) defined in dChip, no outlier chips were identified, so all samples were carried on for subsequent analysis. The data are available both at NCBI's minimum information about a microarray experiment (MIAME)-compliant Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data base and in the supplemental material. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)—PCA projects multivariate data objects onto a lower dimensional space while retaining as much of the original variance as possible. Replicates were averaged to obtain one vector of expression values for each time point in development and regeneration. The 10.5-time point was omitted because of technical concerns with the array but did not influence the conclusions. We used PCA to project the five samples of the liver development time series, each consisting of 45101 variables (probe sets), into a two-dimensional plane. Each sample was normalized to mean zero and S.D. 1. dev2D, a matrix of developmental time points in two dimensions, was obtained through the transformation dev2D=ϕdevT×dev45101D. ϕdev is a 45101 × 2 matrix consisting of the first two principal components of the original data set, dev45101D. Global similarity between liver development and regeneration samples was assessed using the principal components of the development data to transform the regeneration time series (23Kho A. Zhao Q. Cai Z. Butte A. Kim J.Y. Pomeroy S.L. Rowitch D.H. Kohane I.S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Specifically, we obtain reg2D, a matrix of regeneration time points in two dimensions through dev2D=ϕdevT×reg45101D. Again, reg45101D was normalized to mean zero and S.D. 1 before transformation. Analysis of Differential Gene Expression—dChip assigns an S.E. associated with the expression level of each transcript. This S.E. is implied by the fitted model during expression index calculation and reflects the measurement accuracy for the transcript. When calculating the -fold change of a transcript between two groups of chips, standard errors are used to assign confidence intervals to the -fold change. For example, consider a simple model where the expression level of a transcript is compared in two chips. Assume the model-based expression indices for the transcript are e1 and e2 and the associated standard errors are s1 and s2, respectively. Defining f as e1/e2, an inference on f can be made using the quantity Q = (e1 – fe2)2/(s 21 + s 22f 2). Q can be used to construct inverted fixed level tests to define a confidence interval on f, the -fold change. It has been shown that the lower confidence bound (LCB) of -fold change is a stringent estimate of the -fold change and the better ranking statistic for differential gene expression (24Irizarry R.A. Bolstad B.M. Collin F. Cope L.M. Hobbs B. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e15-e25Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). In the dChip analysis, if the 90% LCB of the -fold change between the expression level of the gene in the control 10-week adult liver versus the experimental time point was above 1.5, the corresponding gene was considered differentially expressed. dChip's LCB method for assessing differentially expressed genes is superior to other commonly used approaches, such as Microarray Analysis Suite 5.0- and Robust Multiarray Average-based methods (24Irizarry R.A. Bolstad B.M. Collin F. Cope L.M. Hobbs B. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e15-e25Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar, 25Shedden K. Chen W. Kuick R. Ghosh D. Macdonald J. Cho K.R. Giordano T.J. Gruber S.B. Fearon E.R. Taylor J.M. Hanash S. BMC Bioinformatics. 2003; 6: 26Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Using custom arrays and QRT-PCR, it has been suggested that Affymetrix chips may underestimate differences in gene expression; selecting genes that have a LCB >1.5 most likely corresponds to genes with an “actual” -fold change of at least 3 in gene expression (26Ramalho-Santos M. Yoon S. Matsuzaki Y. Mulligan R.C. Melton D.A. Science. 2002; 298: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Hierarchical Clustering and Heat Map Generation—A hierarchical clustering technique was used to construct an Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic-mean tree using Pearson's correlation as the distance measure (27Sneath P.H.A. Numerical Taxonomy: the Principles and Practice of Numerical Classification. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco1973Google Scholar). Samples are clustered using the normalized and modeled expression values obtained using dChip analysis. The expression data matrix was row-normalized for each gene prior to the application of average linkage clustering. Selected transcripts that are involved in chromatin modification and induced in development or regeneration time points compared with the control 10-week adult liver (LCB >1.5) were used to generate heat maps to follow expression levels over time. Normalized and modeled signal values obtained by dChip analysis were used. These are single values that correspond to the intensity of the hybridization signal. Each transcript has a 0 time point that corresponds to normal adult liver and serves as a reference value for each experimental time point (time after hepatectomy or embryological time) to determine differential expression. Because dChip assigns an absolute intensity for each value, the 0 time reference value varies with each transcript. Expression levels of each transcript are used to scale the samples across the heat map to the [-3,3] interval, where 3, 0, and 3 on the scale correspond to green, black, and red, respectively. Gene Ontology Analysis—Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) identifies biologically relevant categories that are over-represented in the set and therefore may be of further interest (28Hosack D.A. Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EASE maps each probe to an Entrez Gene identifier that is associated with a GO category (29Maglott D. Ostell J. Pruitt K.D. Tatusova T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D54-D58Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 30Ashburner M. Ball C.A. Blake J.A. Botstein D. Butler H. Cherry J.M. Davis A.P. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S. Eppig J.T. Harris M.A. Hill D.P. Issel-Tarver L. Kasarskis A. Lewis S. Matese J.C. Richardson J.E. Ringwald M. Rubin G.M. Sherlock G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 1: 25-29Crossref Scopus (27278) Google Scholar). The transcripts on the chip were mapped to 33,229 unique genes used in the downstream EASE analysis. GO Consortium (www.geneontology.org) assigns each gene (where applicable) to a class of biological function. EASE identifies GO categories in the input gene list that are over-represented using Jackknife iterative resampling of Fisher exact probabilities, with Bonferroni multiple testing correction. The “EASE score” is the upper bound of the distribution of Jackknife Fisher exact probabilities. Categories containing low numbers of genes are underweighted so that the EASE score is more robust than the Fisher exact test. The EASE score is a significance level with smaller EASE scores indicating increasing confidence in overrepresentation. We picked GO categories that have EASE scores of 0.05 or lower as significantly over-represented. Quantification of Gene Expression by QRT-PCR—QRT-PCR was performed using the ABI 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). Reverse transcription of 1 μg of RNA was performed using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (GeneAmp RNA PCR; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The resulting cDNA product was diluted 1:5. PCR amplification was performed in a total volume of 25 μl containing 12.5 μl of 2× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (no Amperase UNG; Applied Biosystems), 6.25 μl of nuclease-free water, 5 μl of cDNA, and 1.25 μl of the appropriate 20× probe (Applied Biosystems). To quantify the levels of mRNA we normalized expression of the target genes to 18 S ribosomal RNA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Data were analyzed using ABI sequence detector software (Applied Biosystems). Comprehensive Assessment of Differential Gene Expression during Liver Development and Regeneration—Using a microarray of more than 45,000 probes we generated a nearly comprehensive data base of gene expression in the adult liver after 2/3 hepatectomy and during embryonic development. A complete list of gene expression, up- and down-regulated genes, and functional and correlation analysis are provided at www.bidmcgenomics.org/LiverDevReg/index.html. Regeneration time points examined were 1, 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 48, and 72 h after hepatectomy. Embryonic time points examined were 10.5, 11.5, 12.5, 13.5, 14.5, and 16.5 dpc. Control mice were normal 10-week-old females. Each time point is represented by two chips with at least three hepatectomy samples/chip. Replicate chips resembled each other with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 ± 0.03 for regeneration and 0.99 ± 0.01 for development (average ± S.D.). Cluster analysis demonstrated high similarity within hepatectomy time points and within embryonic days, but not between the two groups. Complete array expression values produced a cladogram (Fig. 1) reflecting global expression similarities across the samples. Hierarchical clustering of all samples demonstrated a clear distinction based on the post-hepatectomy or development samples. Correlation values close to 1 were common when comparing two time points within the regeneration group or comparing two points within the development group, whereas comparing any sample in one group with any sample in the other group did not yield a correlation of >0.67 (see supplemental data). Replicate time points were not always closest but were always very highly correlated with each other. Compared with normal adult liver, 2111 were up-regulated at least once during the regeneration time course, 9761 genes were up-regulated at least once during the developmental time course, and 885 genes were up-regulated at least once during both regeneration and development. PCA Demonstrates Regeneration Is Distinct from Development—PCA allows large datasets to be devolved into a few constructs that contain most of the variance. The first principal component of the development dataset (PC1) captured 83.5% of the variance, and the second (PC2) captured 8.6% of the variance. PC1 and PC2 of the developmental time series were used to project the regeneration group into the development space. This approach allows us to evaluate gene expression during regeneration in the light of development and assess whether the dominant developmental dimensions play a significant role in regeneration. Regeneration time points did not separate significantly when transformed with developmental principal components and segregated away from development time points (Fig. 2). Regenerating liver was most similar to the later developmental stages in the PC1 axis and was remarkably distinct from early (11.5 dpc) developing liver. Among both the PC1 and PC2 axes there was little variation among regeneration time points, indicating that the traits that distinguish developmental time points do not equivalently distinguish regeneration time points. Categorization of Genes Induced during Regeneration and Development—We performed EASE analysis on three sets of input lists: genes with LCB >1.5 during regeneration, during development, or during both processes as compared with control adult liver. Table 1 summarizes the findings by presenting selected over-represented GO categories. These categories represent classes of genes in which individual members occur more often than would be expected by a random distribution of genes. A complete list of results can be found in the supplemental data. For each category, the number of genes found in the category precedes the EASE score.

Individual genes known to be important for liver regeneration, including STAT3, GATA6, and C/EPBβ, were all identified by this analysis. During development, the large number of genes with LCB >1.5 are preferentially distributed into EASE categories representing chromatin organization, chromosome organization and biogenesis, and transcription. Reflecting the high rate of cell division in the embryonic liver, categories of cell cycle, DNA replication, and mitosis have significant EASE scores, as do genes involved in heme biosynthesis. EASE analysis applied to categories of genes with LCB >1.5 in both regeneration and development revealed significant scores for cell division, including cell cycle, DNA replication, mitosis, and regulation of cell cycle, and genes involved in cytokinesis. Categories conspicuously not represented in this set include transcription factors and genes involved in large-scale chromatin structure and remodeling.

APLT is sensitive to redox modifications of its -SH groups. Because activated macrophages produce reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, we hypothesized that macrophages can directly participate in apoptotic cell clearance by S-nitrosylation/oxidation and inhibition of APLT causing PS externalization. Here we report that exposure of target HL-60 cells to nitrosative stress inhibited APLT, induced PS externalization, and enhanced recognition and elimination of “nitrosatively” modified cells by RAW 264.7 macrophages. Using S-nitroso-l-cysteine-ethyl ester (SNCEE) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) that cause intracellular and extracellular trans-nitrosylation of proteins, respectively, we found that SNCEE (but not GSNO) caused significant S-nitrosylation/oxidation of thiols in HL-60 cells. SNCEE also strongly inhibited APLT, activated scramblase, and caused PS externalization. However, SNCEE did not induce caspase activation or nuclear condensation/fragmentation suggesting that PS externalization was dissociated from the common apoptotic pathway. Dithiothreitol reversed SNCEE-induced S-nitrosylation, APLT inhibition, and PS externalization. SNCEE but not GSNO stimulated phagocytosis of HL-60 cells. Moreover, phagocytosis of target cells by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages was significantly suppressed by an NO. scavenger, DAF-2. Thus, macrophage-induced nitrosylation/oxidation plays an important role in cell clearance, and hence in the resolution of inflammation.

Moreover, externalized PS is essential for triggering of antiinflammatory responses in macrophages (2Huynh M.L. Fadok V.A. Henson P.M. J. Clin.

Therefore, failure to externalize PS may disrupt the clearance of apoptotic cells in vivo and contribute to perpetuating a calamitous proinflammatory environment (14Fadeel B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2575-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Normally PS is confined exclusively to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane (15Devaux P.F. Lopez-Montero I. Bryde S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2006; 141: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); maintenance of this asymmetric PS distribution is because of energy (ATP)-dependent aminophospholipid translocase (APLT) responsible for the inward translocation of amino phospholipids (15Devaux P.F. Lopez-Montero I. Bryde S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2006; 141: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Daleke D.L. Lyles J.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 108-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). During apoptosis, APLT is inactivated causing egress of PS from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (17Fabisiak J.P. Tyurin V.A. Tyurina Y.Y. Sedlov A. Lazo J.S. Kagan V.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Tyurina Y.Y. Serinkan F.B. Tyurin V.A. Kini V. Yalowich J.C. Schroit A.J. Fadeel B. Kagan V.E. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of apoptotic APLT inactivation remain to be elucidated. Reportedly, APLT is not a substrate for apoptosis-activated caspases suggesting that alternative mechanisms may be involved (20Verhoven B. Krahling S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In line with this, PS externalization can be divorced from the common caspase-initiated pathway of apoptosis (21Zhuang J. Ren Y. Snowden R.T. Zhu H. Gogvadze V. Savill J.S. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15628-15632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Uthaisang W. Nutt L.K. Orrenius S. Fadeel B.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) demonstrated that reversible PS externalization can be induced by -SH reagents in non-apoptotic cells. Conversely, certain cell types can undergo apoptosis without PS externalization (24Fadeel B. Gleiss B. Hoögstrand K. Chandra J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Henter J.I. Orrenius S. Samali A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 25Forsberg A.J. Kagan V.E. Schroit A.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2004; 6: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but the resistance to PS externalization in these cells can be completely reversed by treatment with thiol reagents (23Connor J. Schroit A.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Forsberg A.J. Kagan V.E. Schroit A.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2004; 6: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Apparently, the sensitivity of catalytically competent cysteines of APLT to oxidation/alkylation may be important in the regulation of the enzyme activity during apoptosis (5Serinkan B. Gambelli F. Potapovich A.I. Babu H. Di Giuseppe M. Ortiz L.A. Fabisiak J.P. Kagan V.E. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1141-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16Daleke D.L. Lyles J.V. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6768-6776Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).S-Nitrosylation is another redox-related mechanism participating in the modification of protein cysteines (27Foster M.W. McMahon T.J. Stamler J.S. Trends Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 160-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). A variety of enzymes contain essential cysteines whose S-nitrosylation results in changed catalytic activity (28Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Kim S.O. Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). The two major pathways for protein S-nitrosylation are as follows: 1) trans-nitrosylation resulting from the transfer of the nitrosyl functionality from a donor S-nitrosothiol (commonly S-nitrosoglutathione or other low molecular weight thiol) to a recipient cysteine, and 2) direct nitrosylation by peroxynitrite (ONOO-) (formed as a product of the reaction between radical species, nitric oxide (NO.) and superoxide (O2.)) (29Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 34: 17-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Importantly, during inflammation, NADPH oxidase and inducible nitric-oxide synthase in activated macrophages massively produce O2. and NO., respectively, to yield ONOO- (30Radi R. Denicola A.

Aspects Med. 2001; 22: 189-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The latter can readily S-nitrosylate low molecular thiols (32van der Vliet A. Hoen P.A. Wong P.S. Bast A. Cross C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30255-30262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and hence generate pools of trans-nitrosylating species ready to attack protein cysteines (27Foster M.W. McMahon T.J. Stamler J.S. Trends Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 160-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar).We hypothesized that activated macrophages can directly participate in the clearance of target (apoptotic) cells and bystander cells by causing S-nitrosylation/oxidation and inhibition of APLT and inducing PS externalization independently of the execution of the common caspase-dependent pathway of apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrate that exposure of target HL-60 cells to nitrosative stress indeed inhibits APLT, induces PS externalization, and enhances recognition and elimination of “nitosatively” modified cells by RAW 264.7 macrophages. We suggest that this novel mechanism of macrophage-induced nitrosative stress contributes to effective clearance of apoptotic cells and regulates switching of the acute inflammatory reaction to an anti-inflammatory phase of the response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—16:0-12:0 NBD-PS, 1-palmitoyl-2-[12-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (ammonium salt), and 16:0-12:0 NBD-PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-[12-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino] dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-Phospho-choline (ammonium salt), were from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.

DHE-DA and Cell Tracker Orange were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).Cell Culture—HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in RPMI 1640 with phenol red supplemented with 12.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2 plus 95% air). Cells from passages 45-50 were used for the experiments. The density of the cells at collection time was 0.5 × 106 cell/ml. RAW 264.7 macrophages (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2 plus 95% air) at 37 °C.Measurement of Thiol Contents—Low molecular weight thiols and protein thiol contents in the cells were determined fluorometrically using ThioGlo™-1 as described previously (18Tyurina Y.Y.

Briefly, cells treated with either SNCEE (50-300 μm) or GSNO (50-300 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C were collected by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS. GSH was measured in cell lysates prepared by freezing and thawing cells. Immediately after addition of ThioGlo™-1 to the cell lysates, fluorescence was measured in a Packard Fusion™ Multifunctional Plate Reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using excitation 390 ± 15 nm and emission 515 ± 30 nm. Protein sulfhydryls were determined as an additional increase in fluorescence response after addition of SDS (4 mm) to cell lysates.Measurement of S-Nitrosothiols—The content of S-nitrosothiols was determined by fluorescence HPLC using DAF-2 that specifically reacts with NO.

Briefly, samples (50 μl) were mixed with DAF-2 (5 μm) in 2.5 ml of PBS and exposed to UV irradiation (15 min at room temperature) using an Oriel UV light source (model 66002) (Oriel Instruments, Stratford, CT) and cut-off filter (Balzers, >330 nm) (35Tyurin V.A.

After UV irradiation, chloroform (200 μl) was added to precipitate proteins, and samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatant was used for the measurements. Fluorescence HPLC (Eclipse XDB-C18 column, 5 μm, 150 × 4.6 mm; mobile phase was composed of 25 mm disodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, acetonitrile (94:6 v/v), Ex = 495 nm, Em = 515 nm) was performed on a Shimadzu LC-100AT HPLC system equipped with fluorescence detector (RF-10Axl) and autosampler (SIL-10AD). The data obtained were exported and processed using Shimadzu RF-5301 PC personal software. A standard curve was established using GSNO as the standard.APLT and Scramblase Activity Assays—APLT and scramblase activity were measured using NBD-PS and NBD-PC, respectively, as described previously (36McIntyre J.C.

HL-60 cells (5 × 106) were exposed to SNCEE (50-300 μm) or GSNO (50-300 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red. At the end of incubation, the cells were washed twice and suspended in ice-cold incubation buffer (136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and incubated with either NBD-PS or NBD-PC (10 μm) for 10 min at 4 °C. Then the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in the same buffer (5 × 106 cells/ml), and placed in a water bath (at 28 °C) to initiate internalization of NBD-PS. For measurements of scramblase activity, 2 mm CaCl2 was added to the incubation medium. A Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrofluorophotometer was employed for these measurements using the following instrumental conditions: Ex = 470 nm, Em = 540 nm; slits 5 and 10 nm, respectively. We normalized the differences in fluorescence intensities recorded immediately after removal of unbound of NBD-PS by centrifugation and the responses obtained from residual noninternalized NBD-PS (after allowing its internalization for given periods of time) in the presence and absence of a reducing agent, dithionite, to the fluorescence intensity of bound NBD-PS before initiation of its internalization (at 28 °C). Specifically, the percent of internalized NBD-PS was calculated using the following equation: % internalized NBD-PS = (FLt - FL0)/(FLtotal - FL0) × 100, where FLt is the fluorescence intensity measured in the presence of sodium dithionite (10 mm) at a given time point; FLtotal is the fluorescence response from bound plus internalized NBD-PS measured in the absence of dithionite; FL0 is the fluorescence intensity from the cells with NBD-lipid before the initiation of internalization but measured in the presence of dithionite.To estimate possible effects of endocytosis on the uptake of NBD-PS, HL-60 cells were incubated (30 min at 37 °C) in the presence of a mixture containing several commonly used inhibitors of endocytosis (38Ogretmen B.

The cells were then washed with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and incubated in the presence and in the absence of SCNEE (300 μm for 30 min at 37 °C). At the end of incubation, cells were washed with PBS, and the activity of APLT was determined as described above.Two-dimensional High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC)—HL-60 cells with integrated NBD-PS (1.7 nmol × 106 cells for 10 min at 4 °C) were incubated at 28 °C for 20 min. At the end of incubation, lipids were extracted using the Folch procedure (39Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and separated by two-dimensional HPTLC on Silica G plates (Whatman and Schleicher & Schuell). The plates were first developed with a solvent system consisting of chloroform, methanol, 28% ammonium hydroxide (65:25:5, v/v). After drying the plates with a forced air blower to remove the solvent, the plates were developed in the second dimension with a solvent system consisting of chloroform:acetone:methanol:glacial acetic acid:water (50:20:10:10:5, v/v). NBD-PS was localized by exposure of HPTLC plates to UV light by using a Fluor-S™ Multimager (Bio-Rad). The phospholipids were visualized by exposure to iodine vapors. The identified spots were scraped, and the silica was transferred to tubes. Lipid phosphorus was determined by the submicromethod as described by Bottcher et al. (40Bottcher C.J.F. Van Gent C.M. Pries C. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1961; 24: 203-204Crossref Scopus (845) Google Scholar). In addition, TLC plates were scanned, and fluorescence of NBD-PS on plates was estimated using Fluor-S™ Multimager.PS Exposure on Cell Surface—PS exposure on the surface of cells was determined by flow cytometric detection of annexin V staining using a protocol outlined in the annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit (BioVision Research Products, Mountain View, CA). Briefly, HL-60 cells (0.5 × 106) exposed to either SNCEE (50-300 μm) or GSNO (50-300 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in binding buffer were stained with annexin V (0.5 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (0.6 μg/ml) for 5 min at room temperature. After staining, cells were immediately analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with simultaneous monitoring of green fluorescence (530 nm, 30 nm bandpass filter) for annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and red fluorescence (long pass emission filter that transmits light >650 nm) associated with propidium iodide. Ten thousand events were collected and analyzed using the LYSIS™ II software (BD Biosciences).Caspase-3/7 Activity Assay—Caspase-3/7 activity was measured using a luminescence Caspase-Glo® 3/7 assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). HL-60 cells (4 × 105) were incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red in the presence of SNCEE (300 μm) or GSNO (300 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed twice, and caspase-3/7 activity was measured. Luminescence was measured using a plate reading chemiluminometer ML1000 (Dynatech Laboratories). Activity of caspase-3/7 was expressed as luminescence arbitrary units per mg of protein.Nuclear Fragmentation—Nuclear condensation/fragmentation of Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml)-labeled cells was evaluated as described previously (22Uthaisang W. Nutt L.K. Orrenius S. Fadeel B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells were scored using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE TE 200, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital Hamamatsu CCD camera (C4742-95-12NBR).Phagocytosis of HL-60 Cells by RAW 264.7 Macrophages—RAW 264.7 macrophages were seeded into an 8-well chamber slide (5 × 104 cells/well) and cultured overnight in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Naiöve or nitrosatively modified HL-60 cells (i.e. treated in the presence of SNCEE (50-300 μm) as described above) were loaded with Cell Tracker Orange™ (10 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice and co-cultured with macrophages for 1 h at 37 °C. To inhibit caspase activation, HL-60 cells were pretreated with a pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk (10 μm, for 30 min at 37 °C). To prevent oxidative damage leading to nonspecific changes in membrane biophysical properties, HL-60 cells pretreated with Z-VAD-fmk were exposed to a potent lipid antioxidant, etoposide (50 μm, for 1 h at 37 °C). In the same experiments macrophages were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.1 μg/ml for 6 h at 37 °C) and zymosan (0.25 mg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C). After incubation, unbound target cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 medium and three times with PBS and fixed with solution of 2% formaldehyde in PBS containing Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were examined under a Nikon ECLIPSE TE 200 fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital Hamamatsu CCD camera (C4742-95-12NBR) and analyzed using the MetaImaging Series™ software version 4.6 (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). A minimum of 300 macrophages was analyzed per experimental condition. Results are expressed as the percentage of phagocytosis-positive macrophages.Superoxide Production—Intracellular production of O2. was assessed using the dihydroethidium (DHE) oxidation assay (41Zhao H. Kalivendi S. Zhang H. Joseph J. Nithipatikom K. Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). DHE has been specifically recommended for assessments of superoxide production in cells because of its relatively high specificity (41Zhao H. Kalivendi S. Zhang H. Joseph J. Nithipatikom K. Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Macrophages (0.3 × 106/well) were preincubated with DHE-DA (10 μm for 10 min at 37 °C) and then stimulated by zymosan (0.25 mg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with a solution of 2% formaldehyde in PBS. Treated cells were then examined under a Nikon ECLIPSE TE 200 fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital Hamamatsu charge-coupled device camera (C4742-95-12NBR) and analyzed using the MetaImaging Series™ software version 4.6 (Universal Imaging Corp.).Nitric Oxide Production—Intracellular production of NO. was assessed using the DAF-2DA oxidation assay (42Jourd'heuil D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). DAF-2DA has been extensively used for analysis of NO production in cells. In contrast to other NO scavengers, DAF-2 does not readily react with NO. metabolites (NO¯2 and NO¯3) and reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (O¯·2, H2O2, or ONOO-) (34Kojima H. Nakatsubo N. Kikuchi K. Kawahara S. Kirino Y. Nagoshi H. Hirata Y.T. Naganno T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2446-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Acetylated DAF-2DA readily penetrates into cells and, after hydrolysis, acts as a sensitive and one of relatively specific fluorogenic reagents for NO..

Despite the remarkable biology and medical and social importance of human lice, its primary endosymbiont has eluded identification and characterization. Here, we report the host-symbiont interaction of the mycetomic bacterium of the head louse Pediculus humanus capitis and the body louse P. h. humanus. The endosymbiont represents a new bacterial lineage in the gamma-Proteobacteria. Its closest sequenced relative is Arsenophonus nasoniae, from which it differs by more than 10%. A. nasoniae is a male-killing endosymbiont of jewel wasps. Using microdissection and multiphoton confocal microscopy, we show the remarkable interaction of this bacterium with its host. This endosymbiont is unique because it occupies sequentially four different mycetomes during the development of its host, undergoes three cycles of proliferation, changes in length from 2-4 microm to more than 100 microm, and has two extracellular migrations, during one of which the endosymbionts have to outrun its host's immune cells. The host and its symbiont have evolved one of the most complex interactions: two provisional or transitory mycetomes, a main mycetome and a paired filial mycetome. Despite the close relatedness of body and head lice, differences are present in the mycetomic provisioning and the immunological response."
https://openalex.org/W2049654315,"Gap junction channels regulate cell-cell communication by passing metabolites, ions, and signaling molecules. Gap junction channel closure in cells by acidification is well documented; however, it is unknown whether acidification affects connexins or modulating proteins or compounds that in turn act on connexins. Protonated aminosulfonates directly inhibit connexin channel activity in an isoform-specific manner as shown in previously published studies. High-resolution atomic force microscopy of force-dissected connexin26 gap junctions revealed that in HEPES buffer, the pore was closed at pH < 6.5 and opened reversibly by increasing the pH to 7.6. This pH effect was not observed in non-aminosulfonate buffers. Increasing the protonated HEPES concentration did not close the pore, indicating that a saturation of the binding sites occurs at 10 mm HEPES. Analysis of the extracellular surface topographs reveals that the pore diameter increases gradually with pH. The outer connexon diameter remains unchanged, and there is a ∼6.5° rotation in connexon lobes. These observations suggest that the underlying mechanism closing the pore is different from an observed Ca2+-induced closure.

Gap junction channels (GJC) 3The abbreviations used are: GJC, gap junction channels; AFM, atomic force microscopy; Cx26, connexin26; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TAPS, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid; N, Newton; TSF, transport-specific fractionation method; FWHM, full width half-maximum height. are dynamic macromolecular complexes capable of opening and closing the channel pore in response to a number of stimuli such as divalent cations, signal-ing molecules, phosphorylation, pH, and modulators of specific isoforms (1Harris A.L. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These regulated conduits for the passage of small molecules greatly influence homeostasis, development, ionic transmission, and other cellular processes. Whereas there exist strong cell biological, biochemical, and biophysical evidence for the effects of these modulators, there is not much information at the structural level as to the conformational changes that occur in closing the pore in response to these stimuli. Each connexin (Cx) channel is composed of two hexamers (connexons) that dock at their apposed extracellular surfaces. The cyclic arrangement of the subunits within the hexamers suggests that gating can occur by a rotation and translation of the transmembrane segments within all six monomers. It has been postulated that gating occurs as a “camera iris” shutter (2Unwin P.N.T. Ennis P.D. Nature. 1984; 307: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). An alternate hypothesis has been proposed in which intra-connexin associations occur to produce either a particle-receptor blockage at the cytoplasmic surface (3Delmar M. Stergiopoulos K. Homma N.

Verselis V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 5836-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Whether these proposed mechanisms correlate to the closure of fast and/or slow gates that have been characterized by electrophysiological methods (see Ref. 6Bukauskas F.F. Verselis V.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1662: 42-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) remain to be determined. Gating by intracellular acidification is one way that connexin channels open and close in response to stimuli. Experimentally determined decreases in intracellular pH are known to decrease junctional electrical coupling in cardiomyocytes and in Purkinje fibers (7Spray D.C. Burt J.M. Am. J.

Science. 1981; 211: 712-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Stergiopoulos et al. (12Stergiopoulos K. Alvarado J.L. Mastroianni M. Ek-Vitorin J.F. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1144-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) showed that many, but not all, connexins close in a pH-sensitive manner when tested in the paired Xenopus oocyte system. For example, Cx26 channels are pH-sensitive, but Cx32 channels are much less sensitive. Homomeric hemichannels also displayed this pH regulation (13Francis D. Stergiopoulos K. Ek-Vitorin J.F. Cao F.L. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Dev. Genet. 1999; 24: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Differences in the pH regulation of gap junctions were attributable to the diversity of the primary sequence, particularly in certain regions such as the C-terminal tail because the pH sensitivity of the dodecamer channels could be modified only when they were composed of heterotypic combinations (13Francis D. Stergiopoulos K. Ek-Vitorin J.F. Cao F.L. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Dev. Genet. 1999; 24: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, it is important to note that these experiments were done in whole cells and cannot distinguish between gating of the channel because of protonation of the connexin or protonation of modulators or ligands that bind to the connexin and then close the channel. Bevans et al. (14Bevans C.G. Kordel M. Rhee S.K. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2808-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) used another assay system to test for functional pore size called the transport-specific fractionation method (TSF). Heteromeric Cx32/Cx26 connexons reconstituted into liposomes showed pH-dependent channel activity as measured by a permeability assay when suspended in aminosulfonate buffers (e.g. HEPES, TAPS, MES). One of the simplest of these aminosulfonate compounds is taurine, a naturally occurring ubiquitous cytoplasmic component (15Huxtable R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 101-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar, 16Wright C.E. Tallan H.H. Lin Y.Y. Gaull G.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 427-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This pH sensitivity was directly attributed to binding of protonated aminosulfonates to Cx26, because homomeric Cx32 channels did not show this pH sensitivity (17Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3711-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Tao L. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38544-38554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that Cx46 hemichannels in excised patches appear to display pH sensitivity in the absence of any added cytosolic material (19Trexler E.B. Bukauskas F.F. Bennett M.V. Bargiello T.A. Verselis V.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 721-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Previously, we had shown using atomic force microscopy (AFM) that force-dissected connexin26 (Cx26) gap junction hemichannels reversibly open and close in response to Ca2+ acting as ligand (20Muller D.J. Hand G.M. Engel A. Sosinsky G.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3598-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These conformational changes could be only observed on extracellular hemichannel surfaces because the cytoplasmic GJC surface appears too flexible to be imaged at sufficiently high resolution to assign structural changes. This flexibility of the cytoplasmic surface is well documented not only by AFM studies (20Muller D.J. Hand G.M. Engel A. Sosinsky G.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3598-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 21Hoh J. Sosinsky G.E. Revel J.-P. Hansma P.K. Biophys.

Chem. 2006; 281: 23207-23217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) but also by electron microscopy and by other structural and biochemical methods. (For a complete review of flexibility in the cytoplasmic domains see Ref. 23Sosinsky G.E. Nicholson B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1711: 99-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar.) In addition to our previous work, we have been able to image the extracellular surface at higher spatial resolution, allowing insight into the tertiary conformations of polypeptide loops connecting the transmembrane α-helices lining the connexon pore. Remarkably, gating events are well visualized at the extracellular surface. Taking the advantage of AFM to work under freely adjustable physiological conditions, we directly observed the reaction of hemichannels to pH changes of the buffer solution. All experiments were performed at ambient temperatures with fully hydrated proteins under buffer conditions. This simplistic system allows for the in vitro correlation of adding modulating agents and the resulting conformational changes directly imaged with AFM. The high-resolution AFM topographs suggest that the extracellular connexin domains undergo an aminosulfonate-modulated conformational change that closes the connexon channel at the extracellular surface. This conformational change was fully reversible. From these high-resolution AFM topographs, we propose that the mechanism for closure of the extracellular “loop” gate is different from the Ca2+-induced closure observed previously. Cx26 Gap Junction Preparation—Gap junctions were purified from overexpressing stably transfected HeLa cells grown to confluency by following a previously published procedure (24Hand G.M. Muller D.J. Nicholson B.J. Engel A. Sosinsky G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with one modification. For Cx26 gap junctions, HEPES buffer was used instead of Tris buffer because preparations contained more gap junctions and less contaminating material as judged by conventional negative stain transmission electron microscopy. AFM Imaging—AFM topographs were recorded in buffer solution using contact mode. The AFM (Nanoscope III, di-Veeco) was equipped with a fluid cell and oxide-sharpened Si3N4 cantilevers (OMCL TR400PSA, Olympus, Japan), which had a nominal spring constant of ≈0.09 N/m. Prior to imaging, gap junction membranes were adsorbed to freshly cleaved mica as described (20Muller D.J. Hand G.M. Engel A. Sosinsky G.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3598-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 25Muller D.J. Amrein M. Engel A. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 172-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). High-resolution topographs were recorded at minimal contact forces of ≤50 pN, which were manually adjusted to compensate for thermal drift (20Muller D.J. Hand G.M. Engel A. Sosinsky G.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3598-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 26Muller D.J. Fotiadis D. Scheuring S. Muller S.A. Engel A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Proportional and integral gains were adjusted manually to minimize the error (deflection) signal and to maximize the height signal (27Putman C.A.J. van der Werft K. de Grooth B.G. van Hulst N.F. Greve J. Hansma P.K. SPIE. 1992; 1639: 198-204Crossref Google Scholar). When approaching a lateral resolution of ≈1 nm the scanning speed of the AFM tip was between 500 and 1.500 nm/s. Only topographs showing identical structural features scanning the same sample area in trace and retrace direction were selected for further analysis. Topographs showing asymmetric particles or indicating any kind of tip artifacts were not analyzed. Image Processing and Averaging—Topographs (512 × 512 pixel) were selected by the structural details of the protein imaged reproducibly and by comparing the simultaneously monitored height profiles acquired in trace and retrace direction. Correlation averaging was performed using the SEMPER image processing system (28Saxton W.O. Pitt T.J. Horner M. Ultramicroscopy. 1979; 4: 343-354Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar). A well preserved unit cell was selected from the raw data and cross-correlated with the topograph (29Saxton W.O. Baumeister W. J. Micros. 1982; 127: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Unit cells were extracted according to the peak coordinates of the cross-correlated topograph. Single particle averages were generated by translationally and rotationally aligning the unit cells to a reference connexon and then averaged. This correlation average was used as reference for refinement cycles (30Saxton W.O. Baumeister W. Hahn M. Ultramicroscopy. 1984; 13: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Correlation-averaged unit cells were 6-fold symmetrized. To assess the standard deviation σk,l, individual unit cells were extracted according to the coordinates of their correlation peaks and were aligned angularly as well as translationally before single particle averaging (31Frank J. Bretaudiere J.P. Carazo J.M. Verschoor A. Wagenknecht T. J Microsc. 1988; 150: 99-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The S.D. was then calculated from the averaged topograph μk,l for each pixel (k, l) for xi particles (32Schabert F.A. Engel A. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2394-2403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1.σk,l2=1N∑i=1N(Xk,li-μk,l)2(Eq.1) These S.D. maps are displayed as an image in a one-to-one pixel correspondence with the correlation-averaged topograph. The values range from 0.1 (black) to 0.4 (white) nm with the color table continuously ranging from black to white. Previously, we had shown that high-resolution AFM topographs of the extracellular surface could be obtained reproducibly. We also imaged the cytoplasmic surface; but because of the enhanced flexibility of the cytoplasmic domains (23Sosinsky G.E. Nicholson B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1711: 99-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), topographs could be obtained only at very low resolution, which would not allow the revealing of delicate conformational changes such as those observed on the relatively rigid extracellular surface of the hemichannel (20Muller D.J. Hand G.M. Engel A. Sosinsky G.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3598-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). High-Resolution Imaging of the Extracellular Connexon Surface—Force dissection with AFM imaging provides high-resolution surface views of the extracellular surface. Fig. 1A shows a gap junction plaque imaged by AFM in buffer solution. As reported previously, Cx26 gap junctions exhibited a thickness of 17.5 ± 0.8 nm (n = 20), while the surrounding lipid membranes were only 4.5 ± 0.6-nm high (20Muller D.J. Hand G.M. Engel A. Sosinsky G.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3598-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These gap junction plaques exposed their cytoplasmic surfaces to the AFM tip, while the extracellular surfaces were sandwiched between the membranes embedding the bridging connexons. To characterize the extracellular surface, the upper connexon layer of the plaque had to be mechanically removed by the scanning AFM tip (Fig. 1B). At minimal forces of ≤50 pN applied to the scanning AFM cantilever, the repetitive imaging is non-destructive and allows reproducible observation of substructures of proteins embedded in biological membranes in their native conformation (26Muller D.J. Fotiadis D. Scheuring S. Muller S.A. Engel A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, at about 10–20-fold increased forces, the scanning process of the AFM allowed mechanical removal of the upper layer of the gap junction plaque (20Muller D.J. Hand G.M. Engel A. Sosinsky G.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3598-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 33Hoh J.H. Lal R. John S.A. Revel J.-P. Arnsdorf M.F. Science. 1991; 235: 1405-1408Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 34Fotiadis D. Scheuring S. Muller S.A. Engel A. Muller D.J. Micron. 2002; 33: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). After removal of the upper layer, the exposed extracellular surface could be observed at high resolution (Fig. 1C). The unprocessed AFM topograph shows the 6-fold symmetry of each connexon with its characteristic central pore. Each subunit of the connexon is thought to be formed by one connexin showing substructural details (23Sosinsky G.E. Nicholson B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1711: 99-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The correlation average of the connexon surface (Fig. 1, D and E) showed their common structural details, whereas the S.D. map (Fig. 1, F and G) marked regions exhibiting an enhanced structural flexibility. Observing pH-induced Conformational Changes—Visualization of pH-induced conformational changes of the extracellular connexon surface was first performed under constant electrolyte concentration (2 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and at a constant HEPES concentration of 10 mm (Fig. 2). Prior to imaging, the membranes were absorbed onto the mica support using buffers containing 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm EGTA, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Connexons observed at pH 6.0 appear very different to those observed at pH 7.0 and higher. However, it could appear that single connexons show individual deviations among each other. For example, a small number of connexons (<5%) showed different channel diameters than others. To allow statistical relevant conclusions about the average structural conformation of a single connexon under a certain buffer condition, we calculated single particle averages (Fig. 2, G–J, top row). The unprocessed topographs of single connexons and their corresponding averages did not show any significant differences in connexon shape or substructure. The majority of single connexons imaged (>85%) exhibited the same structural conformation as reflected by their average. Thus, we can rule out that the connexons imaged may have represented a mixed state of several conformational states, but rather a single predominant configuration. Connexon averages were computed from AFM topographs recorded at pH 6.0 (Fig. 2G, top), 6.5 (Fig. 2H, top), 7.0 (Fig. 2I, top), and 7.6 (Fig. 2J, top). Averages calculated from connexons imaged at pH 8.0 and 8.5 did not show any significant deviation from that recorded at 7.6 and therefore are not shown. Regions of S.D. maps (Fig. 2, G–J, bottom row) exhibiting enhanced values indicate for structural fluctuations of the connexon surface. All averages show the 8° skew of the connexon lobes from the vertical axis characteristic of detergent-treated samples (35Baker T.S. Caspar D.L.D. Hollingshead C.J. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 204-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In these averages, the connexon is displayed with a left skew. Whereas this overall appearance of the hexameric connexon does not change, the diameter of the central pore significantly increased with increasing pH. Besides measuring the channel diameters of averaged connexons, we analyzed those from single connexons. The histograms (Fig. 3) suggest that the average channel diameter, measured for a certain pH value reflects that of the majority (>85%) of the individual connexons. Under experimental conditions known to induce a closed channel (12Stergiopoulos K. Alvarado J.L. Mastroianni M. Ek-Vitorin J.F. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1144-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3711-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the channel entrance exhibited a maximum depth of 0.4 ± 0.1 nm with a diameter of only 0.6 ± 0.2 nm measured at full width half-maximum height (FWHM). The S.D. map of the average (Fig. 2G, bottom) shows no maxima at the channel entrance, suggesting that this area exhibited no enhanced structural flexibility. The surface structure of the connexon did not significantly change after increasing the pH to 6.5. However, the S.D. map of the closed connexon changed. The region at the channel entrance showed a slightly enhanced value of 0.15 nm (Fig. 2H, bottom), indicating that the corresponding structures now provided some structural flexibility. This may also explain the slightly increased maximum depth of the channel (0.5 ± 0.3 nm). At this pH, the width of the channel entrance increased slightly to 0.9 ± 0.3 nm (n = 91). Further increasing the pH to 7.0 further increased the width of the channel entrance (Fig. 2I, top) to 1.3 ± 0.2 nm (n = 85). As a result of this opening, the AFM tip now could penetrate into the channel entrance, detecting an average maximum depth of 1.2 ± 0.35 nm (n = 40). Furthermore, the S.D. map of the connexon surface (Fig. 2I, bottom) increased its central maxima now indicating that the channel entrance has further increased its flexibility. At the same time, the outer regions of the connexins were observed to slightly enhance flexibility, as indicated by their S.D. increasing to 0.2 nm (n = 40). Increasing the pH to 7.6 (Fig. 2D) finally widened the channel entrance (Fig. 2J, top) to a diameter of 1.7 ± 0.3 nm (n = 81). Concomitant with the opening of the channel entrance the S.D. map (Fig. 2J, bottom) showed that this structural region further increased its flexibility to a maximum S.D. of 0.35 nm (n = 40). Interestingly, individual connexins showed an increased S.D. of 0.25 nm at their outer rims as well. Further increasing the pH to 8 (Fig. 2E) and 8.5 (Fig. 2F) did not significantly change the correlation averages or connexon structures of the extracellular surface (data not shown). It should be noted that “partially closed channels” had a diameter lying between that observed for fully open and closed channels. AFM topographs showed that more than 85% of the single hemichannels had no significant deviation in their channel diameter (Fig. 3). This suggests that the partially closed hemichannels adopted a functional state that reflects an intermediate channel size between fully open and closed conformations and not a mixture of solely open and closed states.FIGURE 3Histogram of pH-induced changes of channel diameters taken from AFM topographs of single Cx26. Topographs were taken from Cx26 membranes in 10 mm HEPES-buffered solutions such as described in the legend to Fig. 2. At minimum, 80 connexins were measured for each histogram. The histogram distributions indicate that the pH-induced increase of the channel diameter is best represented by a process gradually switching from the closed to the fully open state.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To prove whether the observed conformational change was reversible, we decreased the pH to 6.0 after the channels were fully opened at pH 9.0. The AFM topographs recorded showed that the previously opened pore now re-closed, suggesting that their conformational change was fully reversible. Cycles of pH changes were often repeated more than four times. Table 1 summarizes our data for the measurements of inner pore diameter and channel entrance depth for different pH values.TABLE 1Summary of the data on the pH-dependent channel entrance maximum depth and channel entrance diameter measured at the extracellular connexon surfacepHChannel entrance maximum depthChannel entrance diameter (FWHM)nmnm5.5Not determined0.6 ± 0.36.00.4 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.36.50.5 ± 0.30.9 ± 0.37.01.0 ± 0.41.3 ± 0.27.61.1 ± 0.31.7 ± 0.38.00.9 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.38.50.9 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Conformational Changes Are Not Dependent on HEPES Concentration—HEPES belongs to a class of aminosulfonate compounds that have been shown to act as modulators of the Cx26 channel (17Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3711-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Following the lead of Bevans and Harris (17Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3711-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we tested whether the observed conformational change is due solely to pH or to the binding of aminosulfonates to Cx26, which in turn modulates a pH-induced conformational change. We increased the HEPES concentration to 50 mm and imaged the extracellular connexon surface (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, AFM topographs recorded at pH 8.0 (Fig. 4A) and at pH 9 (Fig. 4B) showed that the open state of the connexon channels was not influenced by the increase in protonated HEPES. For both pH conditions, the averages of the inner channel diameters measured from single connexons were 1.6 ± 0.3 nm (n = 83), such as observed for the open connexon conformation (Figs. 2 and 3). Additional experiments were performed in an effort to close open channels with higher HEPES concentrations at pH ≥ 7.5. The sample was absorbed to the mica surface at 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and AFM imaging was performed with the same buffer. At this pH, the effective concentration of protonated HEPES would be maximal at ∼25 mm. Under these conditions, the channels remained open. Open channels were also observed at HEPES concentrations up to 200 mm at pH 7.5 (data not shown). In each case, a positive control (10 mm HEPES, lowering the pH) was included to ensure the functionality of the sample. Alternatively, adsorption at pH 6.5 (50 mm HEPES) was performed to ensure HEPES binding and then increased the pH to 7.5 for AFM imaging. In this case, the topographs revealed open channels at pH 7.5 but partially closed channels at pH 6.5. Therefore, 10 mm may be the concentration for which binding is at saturation conditions in these experiments. No Conformational Change Occurs in the Absence of Aminosulfonates—According to previous findings (17Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3711-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Tao L. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38544-38554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the pH-dependent gating of Cx26 could be only observed in the presence of aminosulfonate-containing compounds. To test this hypothesis and to prove that the conformational change observed can be indeed correlated to the gating mechanism, we imaged connexin preparations at different pH, buffered in non-aminosulfonate buffers. AFM topographs of maleate-buffered connexons showed that they did not change their conformation at pH 6.0, 6.5, or 7.0 (Fig. 5, A–C). The connexon surface did not change at pH values higher than 7.0. Similarly, the extracellular connexon surface apparently did not show a pH-dependent change in their channel diameter if the aqueous solution was buffered with potassium phosphate (KH2PO4) (Fig. 5, D–F). All topographs (Fig. 5, A–F) and correlation averages (Fig. 5, G–N) have in common that the channel entrance appeared widely opened throughout the pH ranges imaged (compare with Fig. 2). Quantitative Analysis of the Channel Closure—The diameter of the average connexon decreased gradually with lower pH (Fig. 6A). Whereas the depth of the channel decreased concomitant with an increase in the width of the connexon lobes, the overall diameter of the connexon itself does not change (Fig. 6B). This is also reflected in the difference image between the fully closed (pH 6.0, Fig. 7A) and fully open (pH 7.6, Fig. 7B) averages shown in Fig. 7C. In this difference image, positive differences are displayed as red and negative differences as black. The medium red level reflects no differences. It is also clear from this difference image that the extracellular region of the subunits rotate by ∼6.5° between the open and closed states (Fig. 7, A and B) thereby changing the diameter of the pore. Our previously published hemichannel structure shows a narrowing of the connexon pore at the extracellular end that may be part of a physical gate closing upon acidification (36Perkins G.A.

Nature. 1990; 346: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (4242) Google Scholar), is activated by several lipid-derived endocannabinoid (eCB) ligands including anandamide and 2-arachydonyl-glycerol (2-AG) (2Devane W.A.

Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). Anandamide production in cells is a phospholipase D-dependent process, whereas 2-AG is generated by diacylglycerol lipases (DAGLs) from diacylglycerol (DAG) (4Pacher P. Batkai S. Kunos G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 389-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). The receptor is widely distributed in several tissues and is one of the most abundant GPCRs in the brain, being predominantly localized in axons of GABAergic neurons (5Howlett A.C. Barth F. Bonner T.I. Cabral G. Casellas P. Devane W.A. Felder C.C. Herkenham M. Mackie K. Martin B.R. Mechoulam R. Pertwee R.G. Pharmacol.

CB1R agonists are already used in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting of cancer patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic therapy, whereas CB1R antagonists have recently been introduced in the therapy of obesity and nicotine addiction (4Pacher P. Batkai S. Kunos G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 389-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). Furthermore, modulating CB1R activity has therapeutical potential in a wide range of pathological conditions including mood and anxiety disorders, movement disorders, neuropathic pain, and multiple sclerosis, as well as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, obesity/metabolic syndrome, and musculoskeletal disorders (4Pacher P. Batkai S. Kunos G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 389-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar, 7Vinod K.Y. Hungund B.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). CB1R couples mainly to the Gi/o family of heterotrimeric G proteins. However, recent data suggest that it can also couple to Gq proteins (4Pacher P. Batkai S. Kunos G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 389-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). CB1Rs mediate retrograde signaling of activated neurons (4Pacher P. Batkai S. Kunos G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 389-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in many cellular systems non-stimulated CB1Rs produce constitutive signal generation and internalization (8Pertwee R.G. Life Sci. 2005; 76: 1307-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Constitutive internalization of CB1Rs has been reported both in HEK-293 cells and in neurons (9Leterrier C. Bonnard D. Carrel D. Rossier J. Lenkei Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36013-36021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 10Leterrier C. Laine J. Darmon M. Boudin H. Rossier J. Lenkei Z. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3141-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This process can be blocked by inverse agonists and is required for the correct axonal localization of CB1Rs in neurons, which underlines the physiological importance of this process (10Leterrier C. Laine J. Darmon M. Boudin H. Rossier J. Lenkei Z. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3141-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although these effects are generally attributed to the constitutive activity of CB1Rs (8Pertwee R.G. Life Sci. 2005; 76: 1307-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), continuous stimulation by eCBs can serve as an alternative mechanism to explain these data. Theoretically, a validated neutral CB1R antagonist, i.e. an antagonist without inverse agonist activity could arbitrate between these two alternative models, but no such molecule has been generated for CB1Rs. Recent papers proposed a role of continuous postsynaptic eCB release in the persistent inhibition of inhibitory postsynaptic currents in hippocampal and proopiomelanocortin neurons. This was shown to be a homosynaptic effect, based on findings that chelation of postsynaptic intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA interferes with the stimulatory effect of CB1R antagonists on presynaptic GABA release (11Neu A. Foldy C. Soltesz I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 578: 233-247Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 12Hentges S.T. Low M.J. Williams J.T. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9746-9751Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Similar findings were also reported in basolateral amygdala neurons (13Zhu P.J. Lovinger D.M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6199-6207Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, other studies showed that constitutive activity of expressed CB1Rs can also be detected in the absence of eCBs both in neurons and CHO cells, suggesting that the receptor is constitutively active (8Pertwee R.G. Life Sci. 2005; 76: 1307-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 14Bouaboula M. Perrachon S. Milligan L. Canat X. Rinaldi-Carmona M. Portier M. Barth F. Calandra B. Pecceu F. Lupker J.

Lewis D.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9271-9280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, constitutive internalization of CB1R is also detected in the somatodendritic region of isolated GABAergic neurons (10Leterrier C. Laine J. Darmon M. Boudin H. Rossier J. Lenkei Z. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3141-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), which cannot be explained by postsynaptic regulation by cannabinoids and homosynaptic regulation. To elucidate the intrinsic properties and the role of eCB release in the basal signaling activity and internalization of CB1Rs, we have expressed these receptors in CHO cells and cultured primary hippocampal neurons and studied the role of DAGLs in these processes. DAGLs are responsible for the production of 2-AG and are widely expressed in most tissues (18Bisogno T. Howell F. Williams G. Minassi A. Cascio M.G. Ligresti A. Matias I. Schiano-Moriello A. Paul P. Williams E.J. Gangadharan U. Hobbs C. Di Marzo V. Doherty P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the inhibition of this enzyme can lead to interference with the basal activity of CB1R expressed in CHO cells. During retrograde signaling CB1R activity in presynaptic terminals can be regulated by eCB release caused by Ca2+ mobilizing agonists (4Pacher P. Batkai S. Kunos G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 389-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar, 6Freund T.F. Katona I. Piomelli D. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1017-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). Since CB1R is expressed in various cells of the cardiovascular system (19Randall M.D. Kendall D.A. O'Sullivan S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 142: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we also tested whether stimulation of co-expressed angiotensin AT1 receptors (AT1Rs), which activate Gq, can increase the activity of CB1Rs in CHO cells. Using energy transfer measurements between heterotrimeric G protein subunits to detect G protein activation, here we show that the basal activity of CB1R in CHO cells is inhibited by THL, a known DAGL inhibitor. Basal CB1R internalization in CHO cells and cultured primary hippocampal neurons is also diminished following THL treatment. Moreover, we show that CB1R is activated following AT1R stimulation in CHO cells, and this activation is blocked by THL or a CB1R blocker. These data suggest the role of DAGLs in the basal activity of CB1R and support the model where this activity is driven by eCBs. Materials—Rat αo-CFP G protein subunit was kindly provided by Dr. N. Gautam (20Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27709-27718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Human β1 and γ11 G protein subunits were obtained from the UMR cDNA Resource Center. Coelenterazine h, fetal bovine serum (FBS), Opti-MEM, Lipofectamine 2000, Neurobasal medium, and Versene were from Invitrogen. Candesartan was a gift from AstraZeneca (Moölndal, Sweden). Unless otherwise stated, all other chemicals and reagents were from Sigma. Plasmid Constructs and Transfection of CHO Cells—The cDNA of the rat CB1R and EYFP-tagged CB1R (CB1R-EYFP) were constructed as described previously (9Leterrier C. Bonnard D. Carrel D. Rossier J. Lenkei Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36013-36021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). EYFP-β1 was generated by subcloning human β1 subunit into the mammalian expression vector pEYFP-C1 (Clontech). αo-Rluc was constructed by replacing the CFP coding region in αo-CFP with Renilla luciferase. Rat HA-AT1R was constructed as described earlier (21Turu G. Szidonya L. Gáborik Z. Buday L. Spaöt A. Clark A.J.L. Hunyady L. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CHO cells were maintained in Ham’s F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin. For BRET and confocal measurements, cells were grown in 6-well plates (on glass coverslips for confocal microscopy) and transfected with the indicated constructs (2 μg of each DNA) using 2 μl/ml Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM. Confocal Laser-scanning Microscopy and CB1R Endocytosis—CHO cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with CB1R-EYFP 48 h prior to measurement. Cells were serum-starved for 3 h with or without THL (1 μm) prior to stimulation with WIN55,212-2 (1 μm). Following stimulation, CHO cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehide and were analyzed by confocal microscopy in 20 cells in each experiment. Images were taken approximately at the largest diameter of the nucleus, with the same settings in all internalization experiments, using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope. YFP was excited with an argon (488 nm) laser, and emitted fluorescences were detected using a 500–530 bandpass filter. Membrane and intracellular fluorescence was measured using ImageJ (W. S. Rasband, ImageJ, United States National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) 1997–2006), and membrane fluorescence was divided by the intracellular fluorescence. Blind selection and analysis of the cells were performed to avoid any bias during the evaluation of the internalization data. Hippocampal Neuronal Cultures, Transfection, and Immunocytochemistry—Transfection, immunocytochemistry, and quantitative imaging of hippocampal neuronal cultures were performed as described previously (10Leterrier C. Laine J. Darmon M. Boudin H. Rossier J. Lenkei Z. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3141-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Treatments were identical to those in CHO cells (see above). For quantification of surface/total ratio of the somatodendritic region, high resolution images of 14–32 transfected neurons from two independent experiments were used. In each series, acquisitions were performed under strictly identical conditions. The somatodendritic compartment was selected on the GFP image (total CB1R) and the mean fluorescence of the GFP and the Alexa-568 (surface CB1R) channels in this region was measured. The ratio of these two mean fluorescences gave to the surface/total ratio. BRET Assay—Energy transfer between G protein subunits was measured using αo fused with Renilla luciferase (αo-Rluc) and β1 labeled with EYFP (EYFP-β1). Medium was changed to FBS-supplemented Ham’s F-12 6 h following transfection and incubated overnight. Before the experiments the cells were serum-starved for 2 h in the absence or presence of THL, then detached with Versene and centrifuged. Cells were suspended in HEPES-buffered F-12 supplemented with 1 g/liter albumin and transferred to white 96-well plates. Coelenterazine h was added in HEPES-buffered Ham’s F-12 to a final concentration of 5 μm, and readings were collected using a Mithras LB 940 Multilabel Reader (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The BRET ratio was defined as (emission at 530 nm)/(emission at 485), and the normalized BRET ratio was calculated as the BRET ratio for the co-expressed EYFP-β1 and αo-Rluc constructs minus the BRET ratio for the co-expressed non-tagged β1 subunit and αo-Rluc constructs. Data are shown as percent changes in normalized BRET ratios compared with the mean of the four control BRET ratio points before the first stimulation (BRET %). Statistical Analysis—All data are presented as means ± S.E. Differences between groups were analyzed by one- or two-way repeated measures analysis of variance combined with Holm-Sidak test using the software SigmaStat for Windows 3.5 (Systat Software Inc., Richmond, CA). The value of p less than 0.05 was considered significant. Measurement of CB1R Activity with BRET—CB1R activity was measured by energy transfer between heterotrimeric G protein subunits. CB1R was co-expressed with γ11, αo-Rluc, and EYFP-β1 subunits in CHO cells. Energy transfer was detected between αo-Rluc and EYFP-β1 prior to stimulation, as shown in Fig. 1A. Stimulation of cells with WIN55,212-2, a CB1R agonist, caused a decrease of the BRET signal, indicating that subunits were dissociated during activation of the heterotrimeric Go protein. However, following the addition of AM251, an inverse agonist, the BRET signal increased, showing that its change was reversible. In contrast, when the inverse agonist was added first (Fig. 1A), it increased the BRET signal, indicating that non-stimulated CB1Rs exert basal activity in CHO cells. Application of WIN55,212-2 after inverse agonist treatment caused no decrease in BRET signal, as expected. Constitutive Activity of CB1R Is Inhibited by DAGL Inhibitor—The endogenous CB1R agonist 2-AG is generated from DAG by DAGLsα andβ (18Bisogno T. Howell F. Williams G. Minassi A. Cascio M.G. Ligresti A. Matias I. Schiano-Moriello A. Paul P. Williams E.J. Gangadharan U. Hobbs C. Di Marzo V. Doherty P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). As DAGLs are expressed in most tissues (18Bisogno T. Howell F. Williams G. Minassi A. Cascio M.G. Ligresti A. Matias I. Schiano-Moriello A. Paul P. Williams E.J. Gangadharan U. Hobbs C. Di Marzo V. Doherty P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), they may produce 2-AG from DAG in non-stimulated cells, which could be responsible for basal CB1R activity. This hypothesis was tested using THL, a DAGL inhibitor (18Bisogno T. Howell F. Williams G. Minassi A. Cascio M.G. Ligresti A. Matias I. Schiano-Moriello A. Paul P. Williams E.J. Gangadharan U. Hobbs C. Di Marzo V. Doherty P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 22Bisogno T. Cascio M.G. Saha B. Mahadevan A. Urbani P. Minassi A. Appendino G. Saturnino C. Martin B. Razdan R. Di Marzo V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell. Biol. Lipids. 2006; 1761: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Addition of THL to cells expressing CB1R and Go protein subunits caused slow elevation of BRET signal compared with control cells, which indicates the presence of DAGL-mediated eCB production in CHO cells (Fig. 1B). Moreover, additional treatment with AM251 caused a lower BRET ratio elevation compared with control cells but reached a similar level (Fig. 1B), indicating that the basal activity was reduced by THL. The time course of the BRET signal elevation could reflect the kinetics of ligand degradation. Addition of WIN55,212-2 to THL-pretreated cells led to activation of Go protein (Fig. 1C). However, the inverse agonist effect of AM251 was much smaller than in cells without pretreatment (compare Fig. 1C with Fig. 1A). The percent changes of the BRET signal following stimulation are presented in Fig. 1D. AM251 treatment caused a smaller elevation of BRET ratio in THL-pretreated cells, and, as expected, the change of BRET ratio following WIN55,212-2 stimulation was augmented (Fig. 1D), demonstrating enhanced G protein activation. These data show that basal Go protein activity was strongly reduced in THL-pretreated cells, suggesting the role of DAGL in the constitutive activity of the CB1R. Similar results were also obtained in HEK-293 cells (data not shown), indicating that DAGL-dependent constitutive activity is not a CHO cell-specific mechanism. THL Pretreatment Leads to Reduced Constitutive Internalization in CHO Cells and Cultured Hippocampal Neurons—CB1Rs internalize constitutively both in HEK-293 and in neuronal cells, as described earlier (9Leterrier C.

Rossier J. Lenkei Z. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3141-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The internalization can be further accelerated by agonists, whereas constitutive internalization is inhibited by inverse agonists (9Leterrier C. Bonnard D. Carrel D. Rossier J. Lenkei Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36013-36021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 23Rinaldi-Carmona M. Le Duigou A. Oustric D. Barth F. Bouaboula M. Carayon P. Casellas P. Le Fur G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 1038-1047PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of DAGL inhibition by THL treatment was determined on constitutive internalization. First, CHO cells transfected with CB1R-EYFP were examined by confocal microscopy. In agreement with previous data (9Leterrier C. Bonnard D. Carrel D. Rossier J. Lenkei Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36013-36021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), CB1R-EYFP is localized both to the plasma membrane and to intracellular vesicles in control cells (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that CB1R internalizes constitutively. 30-min stimulation with 1 μm WIN55,212-2 enhanced the endocytosis of the receptor, as the fluorescence at the plasma membrane decreased, while more intracellular vesicles appeared (Fig. 2C). In contrast, 3-h treatment with THL resulted in CB1R-EYFP translocation from vesicles to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). To demonstrate the relevance of this mechanism in primary cells, we tested the effects of THL treatment in FLAG-CB1R-EGFP-transfected primary hippocampal neurons. Under control conditions, CB1Rs in the somatodendritic compartment were constitutively internalized, as indicated by their preferentially intracellular occurrence and the relatively low surface label density (Fig. 2, F and G), in accordance with previous data (10Leterrier C. Laine J. Darmon M. Boudin H. Rossier J. Lenkei Z. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3141-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The THL treatment resulted in up-regulation of CB1Rs on the somatodendritic cell membrane surface (Fig. 2, H–J). Although constitutive internalization was inhibited, the WIN55,212-2 treatment induced similar internalization levels in control and THL-pretreated CHO cells and in neurons, showing that the internalization process is not attenuated due to nonspecific inhibition of endocytosis (Fig. 2, C–E and J). Angiotensin II (AngII)-induced Activation of CB1Rs—ECB production in CHO cells has not been observed previously (14Bouaboula M. Perrachon S. Milligan L. Canat X. Rinaldi-Carmona M. Portier M. Barth F. Calandra B. Pecceu F. Lupker J. Maffrand J.P. Lefur G. Casellas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22330-22339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether extracellular stimuli, which are expected to lead to DAG production and/or Ca2+ signal, can cause activation of expressed CB1Rs. Since Ca2+ signal in neuronal tissues leads to eCB production (6Freund T.F. Katona I. Piomelli D. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1017-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar), and CB1R is expressed in many tissues in the cardiovascular system (19Randall M.D. Kendall D.A. O'Sullivan S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 142: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we tested whether CB1R activity can be enhanced by co-expression and stimulation of AT1R, a Gq-activating GPCR, which has a significant role in cardiovascular regulation (24Hunyady L. Catt K.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 953-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 25Spaöt A. Hunyady L. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 489-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Co-expression of AT1R with CB1R and stimulation with AngII caused readily detectable Go activation (Fig. 3A). The AngII-dependent activation was blocked both by CB1R inverse agonist (Fig. 3, A and C) and by THL pretreatment (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that it occurred through the DAGL-dependent activation of CB1R. The percent changes in BRET signals are shown on Fig. 3C. In control experiments, stimulation of AT1R, expressed alone with the Go protein subunits, led to some Go activation (data not shown); however, this activation was not influenced by THL or AM251 treatment. Addition of candesartan, an inverse agonist of AT1R, after AngII stimulation reversed the stimulatory action of AngII. The slow kinetics of candesartan action, in contrast to the immediate elevation following WIN55,212-2 plus AM251 treatment (compare Fig. 3A with Fig. 1A), is consistent with the higher agonist affinity of the AT1R. These data suggest that AT1R can transactivate coexpressed CB1Rs in CHO cells through DAGL-mediated eCB production. DAGL activity, responsible for 2-AG production, is present in most tissues (8Pertwee R.G. Life Sci. 2005; 76: 1307-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 18Bisogno T. Howell F. Williams G. Minassi A. Cascio M.G. Ligresti A. Matias I. Schiano-Moriello A. Paul P. Williams E.J. Gangadharan U. Hobbs C. Di Marzo V. Doherty P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), and DAG production by phospholipases C and D is a common process in various cell types. Therefore, we asked whether the basal DAG production and DAGL activity can result in sufficient production of cannabinoid agonist(s) to maintain the constitutive activity of the CB1R. Here we show that DAGL inhibition in CHO cells leads to inhibition of the constitutive activity of CB1R, and similar results were obtained in HEK-293 cells. Moreover, activation of AT1R, a Gq-activating GPCR, leads to activation of CB1R. These data suggest that CHO cells are able to produce a cannabinoid agonist and that this production occurs in non-stimulated cells and can be enhanced by AT1R, and presumably other GPCRs, which can activate Gq. The effect of DAGL inhibition on these processes suggests that these effects are mediated mainly by 2-AG (26Bisogno T. Ligresti A. Di Marzo V. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2005; 81: 224-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Makara J.K. Mor M. Fegley D. Szabo S.I. Kathuria S. Astarita G. Duranti A. Tontini A. Tarzia G. Rivara S. Freund T.F. Piomelli D. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1139-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Basal CB1R activity has been thought to be agonist-independent, based on indirect evidence such as the lack of agonist production in unstimulated CB1R-expressing cells (8Pertwee R.G. Life Sci. 2005; 76: 1307-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In contrast, our data show that CB1R constitutive activity is, at least in part, DAGL-dependent. These data are in good agreement with previous observations, which show that DAGLs are localized in somatodendritic region of the neurons in adult mouse brain (18Bisogno T. Howell F. Williams G. Minassi A. Cascio M.G. Ligresti A. Matias I. Schiano-Moriello A. Paul P. Williams E.J. Gangadharan U. Hobbs C. Di Marzo V. Doherty P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) and CB1Rs internalize constitutively in this region but not in the axons (10Leterrier C. Laine J. Darmon M. Boudin H. Rossier J. Lenkei Z. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3141-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), where the DAGLs are absent. Here we show that not only tonic G protein activation but also the constitutive internalization is inhibited by DAGL inhibitor, both in CHO cells and in the somatodendritic region of cultured hippocampal neurons. The basal activity of CB1Rs can be further activated by stimulation of co-expressed Gq-coupled AT1R. Since the activity depends on endogenous cell-derived ligand(s), it can indicate continuous regulation of receptor operation, depending on other membrane receptor activity, phospholipid turnover, or Ca2+-related signals. In cells co-expressing the CB1R and AT1R, AngII stimulation leads to CB1R activation through DAGLs, and this could cause initiation of CB1R-specific signal transduction pathways, which can be different from those regulated by Gq activation. The CB1R activation after AngII stimulation is a novel mechanism of AT1R-mediated receptor transactivation, similar to the transactivation of EGF and other growth factor receptors reported in various target tissues of AngII (24Hunyady L. Catt K.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 953-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). These data raise the possibility of autocrine regulation of CB1R constitutive activity and internalization in non-neuronal tissues and possibly in somatodendritic region of neurons. Such a mechanism has wide implications for the pharmacological actions of drugs acting on CB1 receptors in the central nervous system and the periphery. This type of regulation is in contrast to the model where CB1R is activated by circulating agonist in non-neuronal tissues, although the two type of activation could co-exist."
https://openalex.org/W1974202616,"The twin arginine (Tat) secretion pathway allows the translocation of folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. Tat-specific signal peptides contain a characteristic amino acid motif ((S/T)RRXFLK) including two highly conserved consecutive arginine residues that are thought to be involved in the recognition of the signal peptides by the Tat translocase. Here, we have analyzed the specificity of Tat signal peptide recognition by using a genetic approach. Replacement of the two arginine residues in a Tat-specific precursor protein by lysine-glutamine resulted in an export-defective mutant precursor that was no longer accepted by the wild-type translocase. Selection for restored export allowed for the isolation of Tat translocases possessing single mutations in either the amino-terminal domain of TatB or the first cytosolic domain of TatC. The mutant Tat translocases still efficiently accepted the unaltered precursor protein, indicating that the substrate specificity of the translocases was not strictly changed; rather, the translocases showed an increased tolerance toward variations of the amino acids occupying the positions of the twin arginine residues in the consensus motif of a Tat signal peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2109742253,"The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) serves as a nutrient sensor and has been implicated in the development of type 2 diabetes. We previously demonstrated that fatty acid oxidation was enhanced in transgenic mouse adipocytes, wherein the rate-limiting enzyme of the HBP, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFA), was overexpressed. To explore the molecular mechanism of the HBP-induced fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes, we studied AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy sensor that stimulates fatty acid oxidation by regulating acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) activity. Phosphorylation and activity of AMPK were increased in transgenic fat pads and in 3T3L1 adipocytes treated with glucosamine to stimulate hexosamine flux. Glucosamine also stimulated phosphorylation of ACC and fatty acid oxidation in 3T3L1 adipocytes, and these stimulatory effects were diminished by adenovirus-mediated expression of a dominant negative AMPK in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Conversely, blocking the HBP with a GFA inhibitor reduced AMPK activity, ACC phosphorylation, and fatty acid oxidation. These changes are not explained by alterations in the cellular AMP/ATP ratio. Further demonstrating that AMPK is regulated by the HBP, we found that AMPK was recognized by succinylated wheat germ agglutinin, which specifically binds O-GlcNAc. The levels of AMPK in succinylated wheat germ agglutinin precipitates correlated with hexosamine flux in mouse fat pads and 3T3L1 adipocytes. Moreover, removal of O-GlcNAc by hexosaminidase reduced AMPK activity. We conclude that chronically high hexosamine flux stimulates fatty acid oxidation by activating AMPK in adipocytes, in part through O-linked glycosylation.

Although there is a major genetic contribution to type 2 diabetes, the largest predisposing factor remains caloric excess and/or obesity. Underlining the importance of this mechanism, excess glucose and lipids themselves can cause the pathological hallmarks of diabetes, insulin resistance, and β-cell failure. One pathway by which excess nutrients can contribute to the diabetic phenotype is the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) 2The abbreviations used are: HBP, hexosamine biosynthesis pathway; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; DN, dominant negative; DON, diaozooxonorleucine; GFA, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase; PP1α, protein phosphatase 1α; sWGA, succinylated wheat germ agglutinin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: HBP, hexosamine biosynthesis pathway; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; DN, dominant negative; DON, diaozooxonorleucine; GFA, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase; PP1α, protein phosphatase 1α; sWGA, succinylated wheat germ agglutinin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein.

The rate-limiting step is catalyzed by enzyme glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFA), and the levels of the product UDP-GlcNAc are proportional to cellular glucose flux and thus able to serve a nutrient sensing function. In the short run, hexosamines function as physiologic glucose sensors that serve an adaptive role in directing excess calories toward storage as fat. When chronically stimulated, however, the HBP can also lead to insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperleptinemia (2McClain D.A. J.

UDP-GlcNAc, the chief product of the pathway, is the substrate for O-glycosyltransferase, which catalyzes the O-linked glycosylation of nuclear and cytosolic proteins with a single N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) moiety on serine and threonine residues (8Hanover J.A.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a pivotal role in regulating energy and metabolic homeostasis and has been dubbed a cellular energy fuel gauge (16Kemp B.E. Stapleton D. Campbell D.J.

AMPK is activated by phosphorylation of Thr172 in a number of physiologic and pathologic states, wherein an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio occurs in the cell (16Kemp B.E. Stapleton D. Campbell D.J.

BioEssays. 2001; 23: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates downstream targets to inhibit ATP-utilizing pathways and stimulate ATP-generating pathways (17Hardie D.G. J.

Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized mechanisms of AMPK in metabolic regulation is its induction of fatty acid oxidation; activation of AMPK stimulates the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which leads to the inhibition of ACC activity and a consequent reduction in malonyl-CoA content, thereby allowing fatty acid uptake into mitochondria and subsequent oxidation (21Ruderman N. Prentki M. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2004; 3: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 22Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that transgenic mouse adipocytes overexpressing GFA at high but physiologic levels exhibited enhanced fatty acid oxidation (23McClain D.A. Hazel M. Parker G. Cooksey R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E973-E979Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This enhanced fat oxidation is somewhat paradoxical, because a pathway that signals fuel excess would be expected to preferentially stimulate fat synthesis. On the other hand, relaxation of a prohibition on fat oxidation in condition of chronic fuel excess would probably be adaptive. In the present study, we demonstrate that hexosamine flux up-regulates AMPK activity in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes and transgenic mouse fat pads, resulting in increased phosphorylation of ACC and activation of fatty acid oxidation. We also found that increased AMPK activity was associated with increased levels of O-GlcNAc protein modification on AMPK or a binding partner and was reversed by enzymatic removal of O-GlcNAc. These findings demonstrate a direct link between two important nutrient sensing pathways, the HBP and AMPK.

Transgenic Animals—Transgenic mice (aP2-GFA) wherein GFA was overexpressed specifically in adipose tissue under control of the aP2 promoter have been described previously (7Hazel M. Cooksey R.C.

Heterozygous transgenic mice and control wild type animals from the same litters were used. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Utah Medical Center. Cell Culture—3T3L1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in DMEM containing 20 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Two days after confluence, 1 μm dexamethasone, 1 μg/ml insulin, and 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine were added for 3 days, followed by 3 days with insulin alone. The cells were then cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum for an additional 4 days. The differentiated adipocytes were then placed in DMEM containing 1% fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of DON (10 μm) for 24 h. Since glucosamine competes poorly with glucose for transport into cells, in order to maximize activation of the HBP and maintain cell viability, we reduced the glucose concentration from 20 to 2.5 mm and added 0.5–10 mm glucosamine. We previously demonstrated that this glucosamine treatment for 24 h generated a significant increase in flux through the HBP as compared with control treatment (20 mm glucose) in 3T3L1 adipocytes, judged by the accumulation of cellular UDP-GlcNAc and protein O-GlcNAc modification (14Parker G.J. Lund K.C. Taylor R.P. McClain D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10022-10027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Adenovirus-mediated Gene Transfer—Replication-defective recombinant adenovirus was generated as described (24He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). AdEasy system components were provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University). To generate the adenoviral vector expressing a dominant negative mutant of AMPKα2 (DN-AMPKα2), AMPKα2 cDNA bearing a mutation of lysine 45 to arginine (K45R) (a gift from Dr. Morris Birnbaum; University of Pennsylvania) was subcloned into a shuttle vector (pAdTrack-CMV). The pAd-DN-AMPK plasmid was linearized by digestion with PmeI and co-transformed into Escherichia coli BJ5183 with the adenoviral backbone plasmid, pAdEasy-1. Homologous recombinants were selected for kanamycin resistance. Finally, the linearized recombinant plasmid was transfected into transformed HEK293 cells. Recombinant adenoviruses were amplified in HEK293 cells. Differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were infected with the adenovirus for 2 days. After removal of virus-containing medium, cells were treated with GFA inhibitor (DON) or glucosamine in fresh culture medium for 24 h. A replication-defective virus expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) was used as a control. Preliminary studies revealed that after 48 h of infection with control GFP, >80% of 3T3L1 adipocytes expressed green fluorescent protein. AMPK Assays—Differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, phosphatase inhibitors), allowed to lyse for 20 min on ice, and then sonicated for 5 s, followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min to remove debris. Fat pad lysates were obtained as described previously (7Hazel M. Cooksey R.C. Jones D. Parker G. Neidigh J.L. Witherbee B. Gulve E.A. McClain D.A. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2118-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In brief, epididymal fat pads from wild type and transgenic mice were collected after sacrifice and immediately placed in ice-cold lysis buffer. After sonication for 5 s, the samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant were used for immunoprecipitation. Cell or tissue lysates were precleared with normal rabbit IgG together with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 4 °C, and then the supernatants were incubated with anti-AMPKα1 for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were collected using protein A/G-agarose, washed three times with lysis buffer and once with AMPK kinase reaction buffer (40 mm HEPES, 80 mm NaCl, 8% glycerol, 0.8 mm EDTA, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm AMP). AMPK immunoprecipitates were incubated with 20 μl of AMPK kinase reaction buffer, 5 μl of SAMS substrate peptide (1 mm), and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, an aliquot was removed and spotted onto Whatman P81 paper. The P81 paper was washed three times with 0.75% (v/v) phosphoric acid and once with acetone. The paper was transferred to a vial containing 3 ml of scintillation mixture, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Immobilization of AMPK with Wheat Germ Agglutinin and Western Blotting—3T3L1 adipocyte or fat pad lysates were mixed with an equal volume of radioimmune precipitation buffer (11 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL, 0.1% SDS, 40 mm NaF, 0.5 mm 2-acetamido-1-amino-1,2-dideoxyglucopyranose, and protease inhibitors). The mixture was precleared with protein A/G-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with 50 μl of sWGA on a rotator for 16 h at 4 °C, followed by washing three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer/lysis buffer (1:1, v/v). sWGA precipitates were used for Western blotting. Western blotting was carried out as previously described (14Parker G.J. Lund K.C. Taylor R.P. McClain D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10022-10027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Densitometry measurements were obtained using NIH ImageJ software. In hexosaminidase digestion experiments, the sWGA precipitates were incubated with 8 units of β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from jack beans for 30 min at 30 °C before the AMPK activity assay (14Parker G.J.

In phosphatase digestion experiments, the 3T3L1 adipocytes were harvested in lysis buffer without EDTA and phosphatase inhibitors, and then the lysates were incubated with 7 units of protein phosphatase-1α (PP1α) for 30 min at 37 °C as described by Parker et al. (14Parker G.J. Lund K.C. Taylor R.P. McClain D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10022-10027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Fatty Acid Oxidation Assay—Palmitic acid oxidation was assayed as described (23McClain D.A. Hazel M. Parker G. Cooksey R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E973-E979Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 3T3L1 adipocytes in 60-mm dishes were cultured in 2 ml of DMEM containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.3 mm palmitic acid, and 20 μCi of [9,10-3H]palmitic acid. After 2 h, palmitic acid oxidation was assessed by measuring 3H2O produced in the incubation medium. The media (0.5 ml) were extracted by the addition of 2.5 ml of methanol/chloroform (1:2, v/v) and 1 ml of 2 m KCl/HCl (1:1, v/v), followed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 15 min. 3H2O release in the aqueous phase was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Background 3H2O release, as measured in an aliquot of medium with [9,10-3H]palmitic acid that was incubated without cells, was subtracted from experimental values. Measurement of AMP, ADP, and ATP Content—Epididymal fat pads from both wild type and transgenic mice were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 5% (v/v) perchloric acid. After sonication for 5 s, the samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C twice to remove acid-insoluble material. Perchloric acid was extracted from the supernatant by three washes of tri-n-octylamine and 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane (1:1, v/v), followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min. To measure adenine nucleotide concentrations in 3T3L1 adipocytes, each well of 3T3L1 adipocytes in 6-well plates was harvested in 300 μl of lysis buffer containing 5% (v/v) perchloric acid. Adenine nucleotides were extracted as described above. Nucleotides were separated by ion exchange chromatography on a Waters Novapak C18 column (3.9 × 150 mm). The column was equilibrated in Buffer A (35 mm potassium phosphate, 6 mm tetrabutylammoniumhydrosulfate, 1.25 μm EDTA, pH 6.0) and developed with a linear gradient from 98% Buffer A, 2% Buffer B (Buffer A/acetonitrile, 1:1) to 50% Buffer A, 50% Buffer B over a 10-min period at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Nucleotides were detected by their absorbance at 261 nm and compared with external standards. Statistical Analysis—Descriptive statistics are represented as the means ± S.E. for the indicated number of experiments. Data were analyzed by Student's t test (two-tailed) or by one-way analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls test for post hoc analysis for multiple-group comparisons using GraphPad InStat software (San Diego, CA). Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Overexpression of GFA in Fat Pads Stimulates AMPK Activity and Phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC—We have previously generated aP2-GFA transgenic mice that overexpress GFA specifically in adipose tissue and found that these transgenic adipocytes with increased hexosamine flux exhibited significantly higher rates of fatty acid oxidation (23McClain D.A. Hazel M. Parker G. Cooksey R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E973-E979Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is known that activation of AMPK stimulates fatty acid oxidation by phosphorylation and inhibition of ACC activity (18Kahn B.B. Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar, 21Ruderman N. Prentki M. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2004; 3: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that AMPK might mediate the effect of hexosamine flux on fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes. AMPK activity is responsive to feeding status as well as hormones, including leptin and adiponectin (17Hardie D.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5479-5487Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 25Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Muller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B.

Therefore, to minimize these effects and maintain carefully controlled hormonal and metabolic conditions, we fasted animals for 24 h and then collected the epididymal fat pads and examined AMPK activity. In adipose tissue, the α1 catalytic subunit is the predominant isoform expressed and accounts for the majority of AMPK activity (27Daval M. Diot-Dupuy F. Bazin R. Hainault I. Viollet B. Vaulont S.

Gould G.W. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the activity of α1-containing AMPK immunoprecipitates was increased to 153 ± 16% (p < 0.05) in fat pads from transgenic mice as compared with wild type littermates. We also observed increased total AMPK activity in ammonium sulfate precipitates of transgenic mouse fat homogenates (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of Thr172 within the AMPKα subunit is essential for its activation (31Hawley S.A. Davison M. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27879-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Consistent with increased AMPK activity, overexpression of GFA in fat pads led to increased phosphorylation of AMPKα (159 ± 19%, p < 0.05; Fig. 1B). There was no significant difference in the levels of AMPKα protein and mRNA in transgenic and wild type fat pads (Fig. 1B and data not shown). To further assess AMPK activity, we also determined the phosphorylation of its downstream target, ACC. Western blot analysis showed that transgenic fat pads had increased phosphorylation of ACC at Ser79 (205 ± 28%, p < 0.05), which paralleled the stimulation of AMPK activity and its Thr172 phosphorylation. Chronic Flux through the HBP Increases AMPK Activity and Fatty Acid Oxidation in 3T3L1 Adipocytes—In the intact animal models, AMPK is under the influence of many intra- and extracellular factors, including leptin and adiponectin (25Minokoshi Y. Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Muller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, 26Ouchi N. Kobayashi H. Kihara S. Kumada M. Sato K. Inoue T. Funahashi T. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1304-1309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). To eliminate some of these influences, we examined the effect of increased hexosamine flux in 3T3L1 adipocytes, which do not exhibit changes in adiponectin and leptin levels with chronic hexosamine treatment (data not shown). To mimic chronically increased hexosamine flux, we treated differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes with glucosamine for 24 h. Glucosamine enters adipocytes through the glucose transport system, is phosphorylated by hexokinase, and directly enters the hexosamine pathway downstream of GFA (3Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Marshall S. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2002; 9: 160-167Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous studies (14Parker G.J. Lund K.C. Taylor R.P. McClain D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10022-10027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), overnight treatment of 3T3L1 adipocytes with glucosamine increased flux through the hexosamine pathway and significantly increased the levels of cellular O-linked GlcNAc on protein (Fig. 2A). Treatment of cells with glucosamine (0.5–10 mm) increased the phosphorylation of AMPKα and ACC in a dose-dependent manner, with no change in expression of the AMPK α subunit. We further verified that glucosamine treatment also increased AMPKα1 activity measured in vitro (Fig. 2B). Stimulation was observed at a glucosamine concentration of 0.5 mm and was nearly maximal at 2 mm. We next blocked the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway in 3T3L1 adipocytes by treating cells for 24 h with DON, a glutamine analog that irreversibly inhibits GFA activity (3Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Marshall S. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 2002; 9: 160-167Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Blocking glucose flux through the HBP significantly inhibited AMPKα1 activity in 3T3L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2C). DON treatment did not, however, affect glucosamine-induced AMPK activation. Because glucosamine enters the HBP downstream of GFA, the results with DON confirm that AMPK activation is mediated by the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway and is not due to nonspecific inhibitory effects of DON. The changes in AMPK activity are accompanied by the expected parallel changes in AMPK and ACC phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that chronic hexosamine flux through the HBP increase AMPK activity. Activation of AMPK has been shown to stimulate fatty acid oxidation through the phosphorylation and inhibition of ACC (21Ruderman N. Prentki M. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2004; 3: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). To confirm that the activation of AMPK by chronic hexosamine flux also resulted in this major downstream effect, we examined fatty acid oxidation in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were treated with glucosamine (10 mm) for 24 h, and then palmitic acid oxidation was measured. Glucosamine treatment increased fatty acid oxidation in 3T3L1 adipocytes (160 ± 6%, p < 0.05, Fig. 3), which paralleled the activation of AMPKα and phosphorylation of ACC (Fig. 2). Conversely, blocking the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway with DON for 24 h significantly reduced fatty acid oxidation by 21% (p < 0.05) in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Glucosamine was able to bypass the inhibition of GFA by DON and stimulate fatty acid oxidation. These results in cultured 3T3L1 adipocytes are consistent with the transgenic mice studies and demonstrate that activation of AMPK by chronic hexosamine flux stimulates fatty acid oxidation. AMPK Is Required for Fatty Acid Oxidation Induced by the HBP in 3T3L1 Adipocytes—To confirm the role of AMPK in the HBP-mediated increase in fatty acid oxidation, we assessed the effect of adenovirus-mediated expression of a dominant negative form of AMPK in adipocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2048430842,"Pulmonary fibrosis is one of the most severe consequences of exposure to paraquat, an herbicide that causes rapid alveolar inflammation and epithelial cell damage. Paraquat is known to induce toxicity in cells by stimulating oxygen utilization via redox cycling and the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates. However, the enzymatic activity mediating this reaction in lung cells is not completely understood. Using self-referencing microsensors, we measured the effects of paraquat on oxygen flux into murine lung epithelial cells. Paraquat (10–100 μm) was found to cause a 2–4-fold increase in cellular oxygen flux. The mitochondrial poisons cyanide, rotenone, and antimycin A prevented mitochondrial- but not paraquat-mediated oxygen flux into cells. In contrast, diphenyleneiodonium (10 μm), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, blocked the effects of paraquat without altering mitochondrial respiration. NADPH oxidases, enzymes that are highly expressed in lung epithelial cells, utilize molecular oxygen to generate superoxide anion. We discovered that lung epithelial cells possess a distinct cytoplasmic diphenyleneiodonium-sensitive NAD(P)H:paraquat oxidoreductase. This enzyme utilizes oxygen, requires NADH or NADPH, and readily generates the reduced paraquat radical. Purification and sequence analysis identified this enzyme activity as thioredoxin reductase. Purified paraquat reductase from the cells contained thioredoxin reductase activity, and purified rat liver thioredoxin reductase or recombinant enzyme possessed paraquat reductase activity. Reactive oxygen intermediates and subsequent oxidative stress generated from this enzyme are likely to contribute to paraquat-induced lung toxicity.

Gaines T.B. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1970; 17: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In target cells paraquat undergoes redox cycling which may contribute to its toxic actions. Several mammalian NADPH oxidases have been identified as potential inducers of paraquat redox cycling including cytochrome P450 reductase and nitric-oxide synthase (2Day B.J. Patel M. Calavetta L.

Reacting rapidly with molecular oxygen, the paraquat radical recycles back to paraquat and in the process forms highly toxic oxidants including superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, and in the presence of nitric oxide, peroxynitrite (5Rashba-Step J.

Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7667-7672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings, it has been suggested that paraquat functions by diverting electron flow from cyanide-sensitive respiration (18Hassan H.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7667-7672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies we report that paraquat treatment of murine lung epithelial cells markedly increases the flux of oxygen into cells in a process that is independent of cyanide-sensitive respiration. These results are consistent with enhanced oxygen utilization during paraquat redox cycling (22Rossouw D.J. Engelbrecht F.M. S. Afr. Med. J. 1978; 54: 199-201PubMed Google Scholar). We also report that redox cycling appears to be initiated by a one-electron reduction of the herbicide by a specific NAD(P)H oxidase.

Cells and Treatments—MLE-15 murine lung epithelial cells were kindly provided by Dr. Jacob Finkelstein (University of Rochester) (30Barrett E.G. Johnston C. Oberdorster G. Finkelstein J.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L1110-L1119PubMed Google Scholar). Parental CHO cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The preparation of CHO cells expressing cytochrome P450 reductase or control empty vector has been described previously (31Han J.F. Wang S.L. He X.Y. Liu C.Y. Hong J.Y. Toxicol. Sci. 2006; 91: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen. For recordings, cells were plated at varying densities (0.05–0.5 × 105 cells) onto 35-mm plastic Petri dishes in phenol red-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal calf serum. At low density cells grow individually, whereas at higher densities cells grow as confluent monolayers. Recordings were performed in phosphate-buffered saline. Paraquat and other reagents were added sequentially directly to the medium. Recordings were suspended during the 10–15 s required to apply the drugs. Time was recorded continuously during the addition of reagents. Self-referencing Electrodes—The preparation and characterization of the oxygen microsensors has been described previously (32Jung S.K. Trimarchi J.R. Sanger R.H. Smith P.J. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 3759-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33Land S.C. Porterfield D.M. Sanger R.H. Smith P.J. J. Exp.

Physiol. 2001; 281: 904-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microsensors were used in a self-referencing format to obtain a directional flux of oxygen by individual cells and monolayers, which is detected as a difference in current (Δfemptoamperes). The advantage of this method is that it minimizes noise and random drift in the measurements, factors that limit the use of standard oxygen electrodes (33Land S.C. Porterfield D.M. Sanger R.H. Smith P.J. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 211-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—NAD(P)H:paraquat oxidoreductase activity was assayed in cell lysates by quantifying ROI generated via redox cycling of paraquat (36Bus J.S. Aust S.D. Gibson J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 58: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 37Winterbourn C.C. FEBS Lett. 1981; 128: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 38Tampo Y. Tsukamoto M. Yonaha M. Free Radic Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), by the paraquat-dependent consumption of oxygen or NADPH in the enzyme assay (39Zhang Z. Yu J. Stanton R.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and by the NADPH-dependent formation of paraquat radical (36Bus J.S. Aust S.D. Gibson J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 58: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 37Winterbourn C.C. FEBS Lett. 1981; 128: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 40Weidauer E. Morke W. Foth H. Bromme H.J. Arch. Toxicol. 2002; 76: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To prepare cell lysates for the assays, cells were gently scraped from the culture dishes, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and sonicated on ice with three 15-s bursts and 1 min of cooling on ice between each sonication burst. Disrupted cells were centrifuged (3000 × g, 10 min) to remove cellular debris, and the supernatants were either assayed immediately for enzyme activity or further used to purify and characterize the paraquat reductase (see further below). Unless otherwise specified, standard reaction mixes contained 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm NADPH or NADH, 10–100 μg of cell lysate protein, and 1–1000 μm paraquat in 0.1 ml. All enzyme assays were run at 37 °C. Hydrogen peroxide production was assayed in 100-μl reaction mixes supplemented with 25 μm 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine and 0.1 units/sample of horseradish peroxidase as previously described (41Towne V. Will M. Oswald B. Zhao Q. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 334: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The fluorescent product resorufin was quantified using an HTS 7000 Plus Bio Assay Reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) fitted with a 540-nm excitation filter and a 595-nm emission filter. Kinetic assays were performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of paraquat, and fluorescence of resorufin was measured every 2.5 min for 30 min. The rate of hydrogen peroxide formation was calculated based on a standard curve generated with hydrogen peroxide in a concentration range of 0.5–30 μm. Initial velocity studies of the NAD(P)H oxidase activity were performed as described previously (42Vetrano A.M. Heck D.E. Mariano T.M. Mishin V. Laskin D.L. Laskin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35372-35381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In some experiments purified rat liver thioredoxin reductase (5 units/ml) or recombinant enzyme (9.8 units/ml) was added in place of cell lysates. Superoxide anion production was assayed by its ability to oxidize hydroethidine to 2-hydroxyethidium cation in the reaction mix; the product was detected using HPLC with fluorescence detection as described by Zhao et al. (43Zhao H. Joseph J. Fales H.M. Sokoloski E.A. Levine R.L. Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5727-5732Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) with minor modifications in the chromatography protocol. HPLC was carried out using a Luna C18 (2Day B.J. Patel M. Calavetta L. Chang L.Y. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12760-12765Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), 3 μm, 250 × 2.0-mm column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and a C18 guard column using a 0.2 ml/min flow rate. The column was equilibrated with 10% CH3CN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The formed products were separated by a linear increase in CH3CN concentration from 10 to 40% starting from 10 to 45 min. The signals from the detector were recorded and analyzed by CLASS-VP software (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD). Hydroxyl radicals were measured by the formation of 2-hydroxyterephthalate from terephthalate using HPLC with fluorescence detection (excitation 315 nm, emission 425 nm) as described by Mishin and Thomas (44Mishin V.M. Thomas P.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 747-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The generation of paraquat radicals and depletion of NADPH in reaction mixtures were quantified in 0.5-ml cuvettes using a Lambda 20 UV/visible spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) scanning at 1 nm/s, recording at 1-nm intervals, and repeating the scan at 2.5-min intervals for 30 min. Paraquat radicals were quantified by increases in absorbance at 603 nm (ɛ603 = 1.20 × 104) (45Autor A.P. Biochemical Mechanisms of Paraquat Toxicity. 1977; (Ist Academic Press, New York): 21-38Google Scholar). Because paraquat radicals are sensitive to oxygen (46Farrington J.A. Ebert M. Land E.J. Fletcher K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 314: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), experiments were run in filled cuvettes covered tightly with Parafilm. NADPH depletion was measured by decreases in absorbance at 340 nm (39Zhang Z. Yu J. Stanton R.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A polarographic system fitted with a Clark oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH) was used to characterize oxygen utilization during enzymatic redox cycling of paraquat. Purification Studies—Lysates containing enzyme activity were centrifuged in an Eppendorf 5417R high speed centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 10 min to sediment membrane and mitochondrial fractions. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged in a Beckman L7–55 ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the microsomal and post-microsomal supernatant fractions were collected. Approximately 40% of the paraquat oxidoreductase activity was contained in the post-microsomal supernatant fractions, whereas the remaining activity was present in membrane and microsomal fractions. The post-mitochondrial supernatant fractions were further purified by NADPH affinity chromatography as described by Wolff et al. (47Wolff D.J. Lubeskie A. Li C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2′,5′-ADP-agarose was added (0.2 volume of settled resin per volume of post-microsomal supernatant), and the suspension was rocked in a cold room for 1 h and then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the resin was washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The resin was then washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 5 mm NADPH. The NADPH eluate was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and then fractionated by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Absorbance of effluent fractions was monitored at 280 nm. The column was previously calibrated with Bio-Rad gel filtration standard proteins (thyroglobulin, Mr 60,000; bovine globulin, Mr 158,000; chicken ovalbumin, Mr 44,000). Fractions containing enzyme activity were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Sequence analysis of protein bands in the gels were performed as previously described (48Senn H. Eugster A. Otting G. Suter F. Wuthrich K. Eur. Biophys. J. 1987; 14: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NCBI Blast algorithms. Thioredoxin Reductase Assay—Thioredoxin reductase activity of the purified paraquat reductase or the recombinant enzyme was assayed by the reduction of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) in the presence of NADPH as described by Kang et al. (49Kang H.J. Hong S.M. Kim B.C. Park E.H. Ahn K. Lim C.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 113-118Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm NADPH, 1 mm DTNB, and appropriate concentrations of purified recombinant thioredoxin reductase or lung cell extract. Enzyme activity was followed by increases in absorbance at 412 nm. In some experiments, 100 μm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene or sodium aurothiomalate (ATM), inhibitors of mammalian thioredoxin reductase, were added the reaction mix. Purification of Thioredoxin Reductase—A construct containing human cytosolic thioredoxin reductase (hTR1) in which the TGA (Sec) codon was replaced with the TGC codon (Sec498Cys) cloned into the PET 28a+ vector (Novagen) was kindly provided by Anton Turanov (University of Nebraska). The thioredoxin reductase was purified from E. coli (BL21(DE3), Novagen) transformed with the construct and induced to express the enzyme as previously described (50Turanov A.A. Su D. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22953-22963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Purity of the enzyme was confirmed by fractionation of the purified protein on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Coomassie staining. Enzymatic activity was confirmed by measuring the enzymatic reduction of DTNB and inhibition of enzyme activity with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene or ATM (51Nordberg J. Arner E.S. Free Radic Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar, 52Gromer S. Arscott L.D. Williams Jr., C.H. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20096-20101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Characterization of Lung Epithelial Cell Oxygen Flux—In initial experiments we used the polarographic self-referencing microsensor to characterize oxygen utilization by lung epithelial cells. When the sensor was placed 1–5 μm from the cells, an oxygen gradient could readily be detected (Figs. 1, A and B). By moving the probe away from the cells, the gradient was mapped. Oxygen flux was detectable at distances up to 50 μm from individual cells and 400–500 μm from confluent monolayers (Fig. 1B and not shown). The fact that oxygen gradients could be detected in areas surrounding the cells indicates that oxygen consumption by the cells is greater than the amount of oxygen available by its diffusion through the medium to the cells. Treatment of the cells with mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitors rotenone (complex I), antimycin A (complex III), or potassium cyanide (complex IV) markedly reduced the oxygen gradients surrounding the cells, indicating that the oxygen consumption was mainly mediated by mitochondrial respiration (Figs. 1, panel C, and 2 and not shown). This conclusion is supported by our findings that the mitochondrial protonophore uncouplers, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, enhanced oxygen uptake by the cells (Figs. 1D and 2B). In further experiments we examined the effects of paraquat on oxygen flux into lung cells. The addition of 100 μm paraquat to the cells resulted in a marked increase (2–4-fold) in oxygen flux that was evident within 15–30 s and persisted for at least 30 min (Fig. 2A); smaller increases in oxygen flux (∼1.5-fold) were observed with 10 μm paraquat (not shown). Neither antimycin A nor potassium cyanide, which block mitochondrial respiration, altered paraquat-induced oxygen flux (Figs. 2, panels A and D, and 3). These data indicate that the effects of paraquat are independent of mitochondrial respiration. Pretreatment of lung cells with inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration also had no effect on paraquat-induced oxygen flux (Fig. 2C and not shown). In contrast, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone-induced increases in oxygen flux were completely blocked by potassium cyanide, demonstrating that the actions of the mitochondrial protonophores and paraquat are distinct (Fig. 2B and not shown). Paraquat has also been reported to stimulate the diaphorase activity of nitric-oxide synthase, a process inhibited by the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor nitroarginine methyl ester (NAME) (2Day B.J. Patel M. Calavetta L. Chang L.Y. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12760-12765Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We found that treatment of the lung epithelial cells with NAME had no effect on mitochondrial or paraquat-induced oxygen flux (Fig. 2D and not shown). These data suggest that nitric-oxide synthase does not affect paraquat-induced oxygen uptake. It is well recognized that several NADPH oxidases, including cytochrome P450 reductase, contribute to extra-mitochondrial oxygen utilization (53Cadenas E. Davies K.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar, 54Mason H.S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Subj. Biochem. 1957; 19: 79-233PubMed Google Scholar). Paraquat is known to redox cycle via cytochrome P450 reductase; whether it is a substrate for NADPH oxidase is unknown (6Bonneh-Barkay D. Reaney S.H. Langston W.J. Di Monte D.A. Mol. Brain Res. 2005; 134: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We found that diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a non-selective inhibitor of FAD-dependent enzymes, including NADPH oxidase, readily blocked paraquat-induced oxygen flux into the cells without affecting mitochondrial respiration (Fig. 4A). This effect was independent of the order of addition of paraquat and DPI to the cultures (compare Figs. 4, A and B). Taken together, these data indicate that paraquat-induced alterations in oxygen uptake are dependent on an FAD-containing oxidoreductase activity in the cells. To eliminate the possibility that cytochrome P450 reductase was responsible for paraquat-induced increases in oxygen flux, we analyzed the effects of the herbicide in cells overexpressing the enzyme. For these studies we used CHO cells stably transfected with mouse CYP450 reductase that have 35-fold more enzyme activity when compared with wild type control CHO cells (31Han J.F. Wang S.L. He X.Y. Liu C.Y. Hong J.Y. Toxicol. Sci. 2006; 91: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 3J. P. Gray, D. E. Heck, V. Mishin, P. J. S. Smith, J.-Y. Hong, M. Thiruchelvam, D. A. Cory-Slechta, D. L. Laskin, and Jeffrey D. Laskin, unpublished information. As observed with lung epithelial cells, paraquat caused a similar increase in oxygen flux into both wild type and cytochrome P450 reductase-overexpressing cells. Subsequent treatment of the cells with potassium cyanide reduced oxygen flux due to mitochondrial respiration (Fig. 5, panels A and B). The fact that the different cell types responded similarly to paraquat indicates that oxygen uptake by the cells induced by paraquat was independent of cytochrome P450 reductase activity. Effects of Paraquat on Lung Epithelial Cell NADPH Oxidase—NADPH oxidase catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADPH to oxygen resulting in the formation of superoxide anion. Superoxide anion rapidly dismutates into hydrogen peroxide and, in the presence of redox active metals, is a source of cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (for review, see Refs. 10McCord J.M. Am. J. Med. 2000; 108: 652-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar and 11Mason R.P. Environ. Health Perspect. 1990; 87: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). NADPH oxidase enzyme activity can readily be quantified by the NADPH-dependent consumption of oxygen, utilization of NADPH, and the production of ROI due to redox cycling of paraquat (36Bus J.S. Aust S.D. Gibson J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 58: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 37Winterbourn C.C.

Mitochondria-free lysates prepared from lung epithelial cells contained very low levels of NADPH oxidase enzyme activity, as measured by oxygen consumption using a Clark oxygen electrode (Fig. 5). The addition of paraquat to the reaction mix caused a marked increase in enzyme activity that was dependent on NADPH. Oxygen consumption by this enzyme was inhibited by DPI (Fig. 5). These findings are consistent with our microsensor studies in intact cells and support the concept that the actions of paraquat are mediated by an FAD-containing NADPH oxidase. In further studies we characterized the paraquat-stimulated NADPH oxidase activity in lung cell lysates. A one-electron reduction of paraquat by this enzyme would be expected to generate the paraquat radical (see Reaction 1). This radical is stable at low oxygen tension and can be quantified spectrophotometrically by its absorption maximum at 603 nm (45Autor A.P. Biochemical"
https://openalex.org/W1975910343,"ADAM17 is a transmembrane metalloprotease involved in the proteolytic release of the extracellular domain of many cell surface molecules, a process known as ectodomain shedding. Despite its likely participation in tumor progression and its current consideration as a therapeutic target, very little is known about the regulation of the expression of ADAM17. Here we show that long term treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF) leads to a marked increase in the levels of ADAM17. EGF receptor activation does not affect the levels of the mRNA that encodes for, or the rate of synthesis of, ADAM17 but increases its half-life. The effect of EGF is biologically relevant because it increases the shedding of several substrates of ADAM17, including the desmosomal cadherin Dsg-2. Analysis of protein and mRNA levels in mammary tumor samples shows that in vivo the levels of ADAM17 can also be controlled post-transcriptionally. Finally, we show that both the shed extracellular domains of Dsg-2 and ADAM17 are frequently expressed in tumors, further supporting the participation of the metalloprotease in malignant progression.

Werb Z. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 2White J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 598-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Structurally, ADAMs are modular proteins containing the following recognizable domains: signal peptide, prodomain, cysteine-rich, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic (3Seals D.F. Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). The prodomain, which keeps the enzyme in an inactive state, is typically removed during transit through the secretory pathway; thus, the metalloprotease reaches the plasma membrane in an active state. At the cell surface, certain ADAMs participate in the proteolytic removal of the ectodomain of a significant number of membrane-anchored proteins. This specialized type of proteolysis is known as ectodomain shedding and affects different cell surface molecules, including growth factors, growth factor receptors, and cell adhesion molecules (4Arribas J. Borroto A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4627-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).Increasing evidence points to a role of certain ADAMs, particularly the 17th member of the family, in the development of certain tumors (5Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). ADAM17, also know as tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme, participates in the activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and related receptors (6Sahin U. Weskamp G. Kelly K. Zhou H.M. Higashiyama S. Peschon J. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), which play a crucial role in the development of different tumors of epidermal origin (7Citri A. Yarden Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). All the ligands for the EGFR are synthesized as transmembrane molecules (8Harris R.C. Chung E. Coffey R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), and the inhibition of the shedding of their extracellular domains, carried out by ADAM17 and other ADAMs, prevents the activation of the EGFR in different experimental settings (see for example Refs. 9Dong J.

Therefore, metalloprotease inhibitors targeting ADAM17 have been proposed as anti-tumor drugs (reviewed in Ref. 12Hynes N.E. Schlange T. Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 7-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Despite its importance, the regulation of the expression of ADAM17 remains poorly characterized. Certain cytokines and growth factors up-regulate the transcription of ADAM17 in endothelial and human monocyte-like cells (13Bzowska M. Jura N. Lassak A. Black R.A. Bereta J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2808-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Worley J.R. Baugh M.D. Hughes D.A. Edwards D.R. Hogan A. Sampson M.J. Gavrilovic J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51340-51346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the expression of ADAM17 can be post-transcriptionally down-modulated by phorbol esters and interferons (15Doedens J.R. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14598-14607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 16Obeid D. Nguyen J. Lesavre P. Bauvois B. Oncogene. 2006; 26: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms and factors that increase the transcription or those that mediate the down-modulation of ADAM17 are unknown and remain uncharacterized. Despite this lack of knowledge, the analysis of its expression in human tumors also points to the participation of ADAM17 in malignant progression (recently reviewed in Ref. 17Arribas J. Bech-Serra J.J. Santiago-Josefat B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2006; 25: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For example, ADAM17 mRNA levels are increased in different types of human tumors (18Ding X. Yang L.Y. Huang G.W. Wang W. Lu W.Q. World J.

Furthermore, although we did not analyze mRNA levels, we have recently found that ADAM17 protein levels are dramatically augmented in the majority of breast cancer samples analyzed (24Borrell-Pagès M. Rojo F. Albanell J. Baselga J. Arribas J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1114-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).Here we show that long term treatment of different cells with EGF leads to a marked increase in the levels of ADAM17. EGFR activation does not affect the levels of the mRNA or the rate of synthesis of ADAM17 but increases its half-life. The effect of EGF on ADAM17 is biologically relevant because it increases the shedding of different substrates of the metalloprotease, including the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein-2. Analysis of ADAM17 protein and mRNA levels in mammary tumor samples shows that in vivo the levels of the metalloprotease can also be controlled post-transcriptionally. Finally, we show that both the shed extracellular domains of Dsg-2 and ADAM17 are frequently expressed in tumors, further supporting the participation of the metalloprotease in malignant progression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—BB-94 and recombinant EGF were obtained from British Biotech and R&D Systems, respectively.

Anti-phospho-MAPK and anti-MAPK were from Cell Signaling. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Furin inhibitor II was from Calbiochem.Cell Culture and Treatments with EGF—A431 and T47D cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium:F-12 medium (1:1) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. MCF7 Tet-Off cells (BD Biosciences) were stably transfected with the pUHD10-3 Hyg vector containing mouse ADAM17 under a doxycycline-responsive promoter. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum on 0.25% gelatin-precoated cell culture plates.For EGF treatments, A431 and T47D cells were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2. After 24 h, cells were serum-starved for an additional 24 h and then treated with 50 ng/ml EGF, 1 μm Iressa (also known as ZD1839), 10 μm BB-94, or 20 μg/ml cycloheximide as indicated for different periods of time. The cells were then lysed as indicated below. When indicated, cells were also treated with 100 μm chloroquine, 10 μm MG132, or 10 μm BB-94 for different times. Potassium depletion was performed as described in Ref. 26Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar.Immunoblotting—Cells or tissue samples were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and proteins in the supernatant were quantified. For Dsg-2 fractionation analysis, Triton-insoluble pellets were solubilized in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 8 m urea. Equal amounts of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. Conditioned media were collected and concentrated with wheat germ agglutinin-agarose beads (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 2 h at 4 °C, which were eluted directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blot analysis. Endoglycosidase H treatments were performed as in Ref. 27Borroto A. Ruiz-Paz S. Villanueva de la Torre T. Borrell-Pages M. Merlos-Suarez A. Pandiella A. Blobel C.P. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Biol.

The cells were then lysed or washed three times with a quenching solution (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm glycine) and incubated at 37 °C for different times in the absence or presence of 50 ng/ml EGF and lysed. Biotinylated proteins were isolated from cell lysates with neutravidin beads and analyzed by anti-ADAM17 immunoblotting.Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells or tissue samples using RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Ambion). Human ADAM17 cDNA was amplified with the following primers: GCACAGGTAATAGCAGTGAGT (forward) and CTCAGCATTTCGACGTTACTG (reverse). Human β-actin cDNA was amplified using the following primers: CCTGACCGAGCGTGGCTAC (forward) and GAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACG (reverse).Northern Blot—6 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. The RNA was then transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N; Amersham Biosciences). The blots were prehybridized at 65 °C for 2 h in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences) before hybridization for 16 h at 65 °C with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probe produced using Ready-to-Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). After stringent washing steps, the blots were exposed to a PhosphorImaging screen.Metabolic Labeling and ADAM17 Immunoprecipitation—∼2 × 104 cells/cm2 exponentially growing A431 cells were serum-starved and treated with EGF for different times, washed twice with methionine- and cysteine-free medium, and incubated for 30 min in medium supplemented with 1 mCi/ml Tran35S-label (Biolink 2000; Arlington Heights, IL). The cells were then washed and lysed in lysis buffer. Lysates were counted and normalized. Equal counts were precleared by incubation with protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. Precleared extracts were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-ADAM17 antibody, followed by a 1-h incubation at 4 °C with protein A-agarose. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Tumor Samples and Immunohistochemistry—The breast tissue samples used in this study were surgical resection specimens obtained at the Vall d’Hebron University Hospital following institutional guidelines. For immunohistochemistry analysis, tumor samples were fixed in 10% neutral formalin following the standard procedures and stained with a polyclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic tail of ADAM17.RESULTSPost-transcriptional Up-regulation of ADAM17 by EGF—Despite the very high levels of expression of ADAM17 in the majority of breast tumors analyzed (24Borrell-Pagès M. Rojo F. Albanell J. Baselga J. Arribas J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1114-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), the mechanism of up-regulation has not been characterized. In search for a model cell line for characterizing the regulation of ADAM17 expression, we used T47D and A431 cells because, compared with a panel of cell lines, they express moderate and low levels of the metalloprotease, respectively (25Bech-Serra J.J. Santiago-Josefat B. Esselens C. Saftig P. Baselga J. Arribas J. Canals F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5086-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Treatment with different agonists, including vitamin D3, retinoic acid, estradiol, phorbol esters, dexamethasone, or transforming growth factor-β, lead to little or no variations in the levels of ADAM17 as judged by Western blotting (data not shown). In contrast, prolonged treatment with EGF induced a 2-fold and a 5-fold increase in the levels of ADAM17 in T47D and A431 cells, respectively (data not shown and Fig. 1A). Because the levels of EGFR in A431 cells are very high compared with those in T47D cells (28Moasser M.M. Basso A. Averbuch S.D. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7184-7188PubMed Google Scholar), this result suggests that, indeed, the activation of the EGFR could lead to the up-regulation of ADAM17. To confirm this conclusion, we treated cells with EGF and Iressa, a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the EGFR. As shown in Fig. 1B, Iressa effectively prevented the up-regulation of ADAM17 by EGF. As a control we analyzed the levels of phospho-MAPK, a well characterized downstream target of activated EGFR (7Citri A. Yarden Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar).Because most, if not all, shedding events carried out by ADAM17 take place at the cell surface (29Arribas J. Merlos-Suárez A. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 5: 125-144Crossref Google Scholar), intracellular ADAM17, even when processed, is likely biologically inactive. To analyze the subcellular localization of ADAM17 in cells treated with EGF, we performed biotinylation experiments. In agreement with previous reports (27Borroto A. Ruiz-Paz S. Villanueva de la Torre T. Borrell-Pages M. Merlos-Suarez A. Pandiella A. Blobel C.P. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25933-25939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), only mature ADAM17 can be detected at the cell surface (Fig. 1C); pro-ADAM17 is intracellular and localizes largely to the early secretory pathway. As shown in Fig. 1C, treatment with EGF leads to a marked increase of ADAM17 at the cell surface, where it can cleave its substrates.EGFR activation frequently leads to the transcriptional activation of target genes (7Citri A. Yarden Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the steady-state levels of the mRNA encoding ADAM17 in cells treated with EGF. Analysis, both by Northern blotting and reverse transcription-PCR, showed a slight increase in the levels of the mRNA encoding ADAM17 at 60 h of treatment with EGF (Fig. 2A and data not shown). However, because the increase in protein levels is readily apparent at 24 h (see Fig. 1A), we conclude that the up-regulation of ADAM17 by EGF does not primarily affect the levels of mRNA and therefore is post-transcriptional. To confirm this conclusion, we analyzed the outcome of increasing the transcription of ADAM17. As shown in Fig. 2B, induction of mRNA expression by treating with doxycycline a cell line transfected with ADAM17 under the control of a repressible promoter (Tet-Off) leads to the accumulation of pro-ADAM17 and little or no increase of ADAM17 (Fig. 2B). This result is in agreement with recent results showing that transfection of ADAM17 in different cell lines, including A431, leads to the specific accumulation of the proform of the metalloprotease in the early secretory pathway (25Bech-Serra J.J.

Commun. 2004; 314: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment with EGF leads to the predominant accumulation of processed ADAM17 (Fig. 2B), further supporting that the mechanism involved is not transcriptional.FIGURE 2Effect of EGF on ADAM17 mRNA levels. Serum-starved A431 cells were incubated in media with or without (NA) 50 ng/ml EGF. At the indicated time points cells were lysed, and total RNA was purified and analyzed by Northern blot with radioactively labeled ADAM17 or actin probes followed by autoradiography (A). B, MCF7 cells expressing the ADAM17 cDNA under the control of a Tet-Off system (left) or A431 cells (right) were treated for 24 h with or without doxycycline (Doxo) or EGF, respectively, and lysed. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot with antibodies against the intracellular domain of ADAM17. To confirm similar protein loading (LC), Ponceau S staining of the blot (left) or Western blot with anti-actin antibodies (right) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)EGF Does Not Affect the Rate of Synthesis of ADAM17 but Increases Its Half-life—To further characterize the effect of EGF, we first analyzed the rate of synthesis of ADAM17 in the presence of this growth factor. Thus, we treated cells with or without EGF and followed the levels of the metalloprotease by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation. The synthesis of ADAM17 was unaffected by treatment with EGF at the different time points examined (Fig. 3A), indicating that an increase in the translation of the mRNA encoding the metalloprotease is not the main mechanism of up-regulation.FIGURE 3Effect of EGF on the biosynthesis and degradation of ADAM17. A, serum-starved A431 cells were treated without or with EGF for the indicated times. The cells were then metabolically labeled for 30 min and lysed, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-ADAM17 or nonspecific IgG (C) antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. B, serum-starved A431 cells were treated with or without (NA) EGF for 24 h and treated with cycloheximide for the indicated times and lysed. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot with anti-ADAM17 antibodies and quantified. C, serum-starved A431 cells were treated with or without (NA) EGF for 24 h, shifted to 4 °C, and labeled with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin to specifically modify cell surface proteins. The cells were then shifted back to 37 °C, and the treatment with or without EGF was continued for the indicated times. Then the cells were lysed, and biotinylated proteins were concentrated with immobilized neutravidin and analyzed by Western blot with antibodies against ADAM17. The results of four independent experiments were quantified, and the averages ± S.D. of the results are represented (*, Student’s t test values (p < 0.005)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assay the half-life of ADAM17, we performed a pulse-chase experiment. Unfortunately, even in the presence of EGF, labeled ADAM17 could not be detected after 6 h of labeling (data not shown), probably because of the low affinity of the antibodies available. This technical problem is complicated by the low levels of expression of ADAM17 in A431 cells (25Bech-Serra J.J. Santiago-Josefat B. Esselens C. Saftig P. Baselga J. Arribas J. Canals F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5086-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As an alternative method to analyze the half-life of ADAM17, we used cycloheximide, a compound that inhibits protein synthesis and therefore allows us to monitor the fate of proteins by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 3B, in cells treated with cycloheximide, the half-life of pro-ADAM17 is ∼4 h, and the levels of ADAM17 are reduced ∼20% during the same period. These results are in agreement with the half-life of ADAM17 as described previously in COS and Chinese hamster ovary cells (27Borroto A. Ruiz-Paz S. Villanueva de la Torre T. Borrell-Pages M. Merlos-Suarez A. Pandiella A. Blobel C.P. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25933-25939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Schloöndorff J. Becherer J.D. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 131-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with EGF and cycloheximide did not have any effect on the half-life of pro-ADAM17 but prevented the degradation of ADAM17. This result clearly indicates that the effect of EGF is because of an inhibition of the degradation of ADAM17. Unfortunately, this analysis could not be performed at longer time points because of the toxic effects of cycloheximide.To confirm these results with an independent technique, we monitored the levels of cell surface ADAM17 labeled with biotin in a time course experiment. Consistent with published reports (15Doedens J.R. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14598-14607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), the half-life of biotin-labeled ADAM17 in untreated cells is ∼24 h (Fig. 3C). Treatment with EGF clearly increased the half-life of biotinylated ADAM17, further supporting that the increase in the levels observed is because of an inhibition of the degradation of this metalloprotease.EGF Activates the Shedding of Different ADAM17 Substrates—To determine whether the effect of EGF is functionally relevant, and results in the activation of the proteolytic activity of ADAM17, we analyzed the levels of the cell-associated and soluble forms of several substrates of this metalloprotease. We chose APP, ALCAM, and Dsg-2 because they are endogenously expressed by A431 cells (25Bech-Serra J.J. Santiago-Josefat B. Esselens C. Saftig P. Baselga J. Arribas J. Canals F. Mol. Cell.

ADAM17 is responsible for the shedding of ALCAM (25Bech-Serra J.J. Santiago-Josefat B. Esselens C. Saftig P. Baselga J. Arribas J. Canals F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5086-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas both ADAM17 and ADAM10 are involved in the shedding of APP and Dsg-2 (25Bech-Serra J.J. Santiago-Josefat B. Esselens C.

Concomitantly with the increase in the levels of ADAM17 (Fig. 4D), treatment of A431 cells with EGF leads to an increase in the levels of the soluble forms of Dsg-2, ALCAM, and APP (Fig. 4, A-C). As expected, the increments in the production of soluble extracellular domains are readily prevented by treatment with the metalloprotease inhibitor BB-94 (Fig. 4, A-C), indicating that they are because of increased levels of ectodomain shedding. Despite the fact that ADAM10 can also act on APP and Dsg-2, the increase in the shedding of these molecules is likely attributable to ADAM17, because EGF has no effect on the levels of ADAM10 (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that the up-regulation of ADAM17 by EGF leads to an increase in the shedding of the substrates analyzed.FIGURE 4Effect of EGF on the shedding of Dsg-2, ALCAM, and APP and on the levels of ADAM17 and ADAM10. A431 cells were treated with or without EGF and BB-94 as indicated for 24 h. The cells were then lysed and conditioned media and cell lysates analyzed by Western blot with antibodies against the extracellular domains of Dsg-2 (A), ALCAM (B), or APP (C), or against the intracellular domains of ADAM17 or ADAM10 (D) as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of ADAM17 mRNA in Breast Cancer Samples—Despite the very high levels of expression of ADAM17 in some breast tumors (Fig. 5, A and B), the mechanism of up-regulation is unknown (24Borrell-Pagès M.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1114-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar); to characterize it, we analyzed the levels of the mRNA encoding the metalloprotease by reverse transcription-PCR and Northern blot in 15 tumor samples and matched normal tissue. Both techniques showed little or no increase of ADAM17 mRNA in tumor samples (Fig. 5, C and D and data not shown). Because of the low availability of normal tissue, note that the corresponding lanes are underloaded in the Northern blot shown in Fig. 5D; however, normalization of the quantitative data confirmed little or no"
https://openalex.org/W2162133081,"The treatment of dyspeptic disorders with anti-acids leads to an increased risk of sensitization against food allergens. As these drugs are taken by 30-50% of pregnant women due to reflux and heartburn, we aimed here to investigate the impact of maternal therapy with anti-acids on the immune response in the offspring in a murine model. Codfish extract as model allergen was fed with or without sucralfate, an anti-acid drug, to pregnant BALB/c mice during pregnancy and lactation. These mothers developed a codfish-specific allergic response shown as high IgG1 and IgE antibody levels and positive skin tests. In the next step we analyzed whether this maternal sensitization impacts a subsequent sensitization in the offspring. Indeed, in stimulated splenocytes of these offspring we found a relative Th2-dominance, because the Th1- and T-regulatory cytokines were significantly suppressed. Our data provide evidence that the anti-acid drug sucralfate supports sensitization against food in pregnant mice and favors a Th2-milieu in their offspring. From these results we propose that anti-acid treatment during pregnancy could be responsible for the increasing number of sensitizations against food allergens in young infants."

Although innate recognition of pathogens by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) is thought to play a crucial role in promotion of inflammatory responses, the molecular basis for early-phase responses of endothelial cells to bacterial pathogens has not fully been understood. We here report that human aortic endothelial cells respond to bacterial lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and synthetic bacterial lipopeptides, but not lipopolysaccharide or peptidoglycan, to induce Weibel-Palade body exocytosis, accompanied by release or externalization of the storage components von Willebrand factor and P-selectin. LTA could activate rapid Weibel-Palade body exocytosis through a TLR2- and MyD88-dependent mechanism without de novo protein synthesis. This process was at least mediated through MyD88-dependent phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase Cγ. Moreover, LTA activated interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1-dependent delayed exocytosis with de novo protein synthesis and phospholipase Cγ-dependent activation of the NF-κB pathway. Increased TLR2 expression by transfection or interferon-γ treatment increased TLR2-mediated Weibel-Palade body exocytosis, whereas reduced TLR2 expression under laminar flow decreased the response.

The onset of inflammatory responses of vascular endothelial cells plays crucial roles in recruitment of immune cells, thrombus formation, and development of vascular inflammation or atherosclerosis.

Morrell C.N. Yamakuchi M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2005; 15: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 2Rondaij M.G. Bierings R. Kragt A. van Mourik J.A. Voorberg J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Recently, excess innate immune responses of vessel walls or endothelium to invading pathogens have been suggested to be linked to atherogenesis. Several common bacterial infectious agents or invasive pathogens, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and oral commensal bacteria, have so far been detected in vessel walls or atheroscrelotic lesions in humans (3Danesh J. Am. Heart J. 1999; 138: S434-S437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Desvarieux M. Demmer R.T. Rundek T. Boden-Albala B. Jacobs Jr., D.R. Sacco R.L. Papapanou P.N. Circulation. 2005; 111: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, the linkage between artery endothelial innate recognition of such pathogens and inflammatory responses has not been fully elucidated. For the detection of invasive bacteria in host defense, several Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are employed to identify molecular motifs that usually compose bacterial bodies (5Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6699) Google Scholar). Among TLR members in humans, TLR2 detects the widest range of common bacterial constituents, such as lipoteichoic acids (LTA), peptidoglycans (PGN), bacterial di- or triacylated lipoproteins or lipopeptides, lipoarabinomannans, porins, and fimbriae (5Akira S.

TLR4 and TLR5 contribute to the recognition of only a few bacterial components, i.e. LPS and flagellin (9Reed K.A. Hobert M.E. Kolenda C.E. Sands K.A. Rathman M. O'Connor M. Lyons S. Gewirtz A.T.

Because TLR1 and TLR6 participate in the accurate discrimination of molecular structures by TLR2 as coreceptors, several molecules, including CD14, CD36, and LOX-1, further facilitate the interactions of TLR2 with bacterial pathogens (5Akira S.

After recognition of cognate agonists, endothelial TLRs activate the classic Toll/IL-1R signaling pathway utilizing MyD88 and IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK)-1, which ultimately activate a TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) 6 complex and IκBs and the release and translocation of active NF-κB to the nucleus. The artery endothelial NF-κB signaling pathways downstream of TLRs are thought to participate in the development of artery inflammatory diseases or atherogenesis through the promotion of the expression of a large number of proinflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules (13Mullaly S.C. Kubes P. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 14Tobias P. Curtiss L.K. J.

In this study, we investigated the early-phase proinflammatory responses of human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) to bacterial cell wall constituents. We found that recognition of bacterial constituents by TLRs, especially by TLR2 but not TLR4, could activate Weibel-Palade body exocytosis. We further investigated the involvement of MyD88 in regulation of the cell response.

LY294002 was purchased from Calbiochem. Monoclonal antibodies to human TLR2, TL2.1 (BD Biosciences), TL2.3 (eBioscience), and IMG-319 (Immugenex), were purchased for a TLR2 blocking study and flow cytometry. Antibodies to PLCγ1 and phosphorylated PLCγ1 (Y783) were obtained from Cell Signaling Biotechnology. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated.

The dominant negative TLR2 (P681H) was constructed using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell Culture and Transfection of siRNA—HEK293 cells and human monocytic THP-1 cells were grown as described previously (20Into T. Kiura K. Yasuda M. Kataoka H. Inoue N. Hasebe A. Takeda K. Akira S. Shibata K. Cell Microbiol. 2004; 6: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). HAECs and HUVECs were grown in endothelial growth medium-2 (Camblex) as described previously (21Matsushita K. Morrell C.N. Cambien B. Yang S.X. Yamakuchi M. Bao C. Hara M.R. Quick R.A. Cao W. O'Rourke B. Lowenstein J.M. Pevsner J. Wagner D.D. Lowenstein C.J.

All of the gene-specific siRNA oligonucleotides for human TLR1, TLR2, TLR6, MyD88, and IRAK-1 and a control oligonucleotide were purchased from Dharmacon. Although the sequences were not provided by the manufacturer, significant suppressive effects on the respective gene expression could be confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR compared with the control transfection (data not shown). For the transfection of siRNA, confluent HAECs or HUVECs seeded on 6- or 24-well plates were prepared and washed once with Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen). Transfection of siRNAs (100 nm) was performed with Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) as instructed by the manufacturer. Toxi-Blocker transfection supplement (TOYOBO) was used to prevent cytotoxicity of lipofection reagents. After 12 h of incubation, culture media were changed to endothelial growth medium-2 media, and incubation was continued for 24 h. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—HEK293 cells stably transfected with human TLR2 gene (or mock control vector) were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates before DNA transfection. The cells were transiently transfected with 50 ng of an NF-κB-driven firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pNF-κB-Luc, Stratagene) and 5 ng of a construct directing expression of Renilla luciferase under the control of a constitutively active thymidine kinase promoter (pRL-TK, Promega). After 12 h of incubation, the cells were transfected with 100 nm siRNA oligonucleotide for MyD88 (or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control). Toxi-Blocker transfection supplement was used to prevent cytotoxicity of lipofection reagents. After a further 24 h of incubation, the cells were stimulated with TLR2 agonists in media containing 1% fetal bovine serum for 6 h. Then the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured as described previously (17Fujita M. Into T. Yasuda M. Okusawa T. Hamahira S. Kuroki Y. Eto A. Nisizawa T. Morita M. Shibata K. J.

Determination of VWF, IL-8, and TNF-α by ELISA—HAECs were grown on 24-well plates, then washed and placed in 200 μl of Opti-Mem I (Invitrogen) containing 1% fetal bovine serum without growth factors, and stimulated with various concentrations of TLR2 agonists for 60 min. The amount of VWF released into the medium was measured by a VWF ELISA kit (American Diagnostica) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Results are representative of three separate experiments and expressed as means ± S.D. To clarify the mechanism by which TLR2 induces VWF exocytosis, HAECs were pretreated for 30 min with 10 μm U-73211 and then stimulated with LTA for 60 min. For other experiments, HAECs were pretreated with 10 μm BAPTA-AM for 30 min or 10 ng/ml IFN-γ for 12 h or precultured with CaCl2-free DMEM for 1 h. To determine the amounts of IL-8 released, HAECs were grown on 96-well plates and then washed and placed in 200 μl of Opti-Mem I (Invitrogen) containing 1% fetal bovine serum and stimulated for 4 h with various concentrations of TLR2 agonists. The amounts of IL-8 released into the media were measured by human IL-8 Cytoset (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. THP-1 cells (1 × 105) were stimulated for 6 h with various concentrations of TLR2 agonists. The amounts of TNF-α released into the media were measured by human TNF-α Cytoset (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Results are representative of three separate experiments and expressed as means ± S.D. Adhesion Assay—Confluent HAECs seeded on 24-well plates were treated with 10 μg/ml LTA for 60 min. The culture medium was then removed, and monocytic THP-1 cells (2.5 × 105) prelabeled with Alexa564-conjugated concanavalin A were added to the culture. Cells were then allowed to adhere for 30 min on a rocking platform. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, fluorescent images were immediately obtained by a fluorescent microscope IX71 with DP70 image capture (Olympus) and processed using Adobe Photoshop, version 7.0. Adhesion of red fluorescent cells was quantified in three fields per well. Results are representative of three separate experiments and expressed as means ± S.D. Immunofluorescence of VWF—Confluent HAECs were treated with 10 μg/ml LTA or 10 μm A23187 for 60 min. The culture media were removed, and the cells were immediately fixed at -20 °C with methanol for 60 min. Immunostaining was carried out using an anti-VWF rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Cell nuclei were also stained with 2.5 μg/ml Hoöechst 33342 for 30 min. Images were obtained by a fluorescent microscope IX71 (magnification: ×40) with DP70 image capture (Olympus) in the presence of the Prolong Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and processed using Adobe Photoshop, version 7.0 (Adobe). Results are representative of three separate experiments. Immunoblot Analysis—Confluent HAECs seeded on 60-mm plates were transfected with gene-specific siRNA and incubated in Opti-Mem I media containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 4–6 h. The cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml LTA for 0–60 min and lysed with a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-hydrochloride (pH 7.2), 150 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 in the presence of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 15 min followed by clarification by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (17Fujita M. Into T. Yasuda M. Okusawa T. Hamahira S. Kuroki Y. Eto A. Nisizawa T. Morita M. Shibata K. J.

Flow Cytometry—To assess the surface expression of P-selectin, confluent HAECs were treated with 10 μg/ml LTA for 30 min. To assess the surface expression of TLR2, confluent HAECs or HUVECs were treated with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ or they were incubated for 12 h under laminar flow. Cell culture under laminar flow was performed with a cone and plate apparatus as described previously (22Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Rippmann V. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Magnitude of the flow was controlled at ∼15 dyn/cm2. The cells were then removed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm EDTA and fixed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 60 min. The cells were then incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with anti-TLR2 monoclonal antibody (IMG-319), anti-P-selectin monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), or isotype-matched mouse IgG and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Fluorescence was measured using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Statistics—All values were evaluated by statistical analysis using one-way analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keul’s test. Differences were considered to be statistically significant at the level of p < 0.05. Induction of Weibel-Palade Body Exocytosis by Bacterial Constituents—We first examined whether bacterial LTA activated degranulation of Weibel-Palade bodies, because LTA has been reported to stimulate vascular endothelial cells, leading to induction of production of proinflammatory mediators, dysfunction, or cell death (23Doran K.S. Engelson E.J. Khosravi A. Maisey H.C. Fedtke I. Equils O. Michelsen K.S. Arditi M. Peschel A. Nizet V. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2499-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 24Bermpohl D.

Stechschulte D.J. Dileepan K.N. Immunology. 2004; 113: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). After stimulation of HAECs for 30 min, LTA clearly decreased the amount of Weibel-Palade bodies, stained with an antibody to VWF, in the cells (Fig. 1A). Compared with the calcium ionophore (A23187)-induced response, we found that LTA gradually activated Weibel-Palade body exocytosis, quantification of which was performed by measuring the amount of VWF released into the media (Fig. 1B). VWF release by stimulation with LTA for 60 min was not suppressed by treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, whereas the release by stimulation with LTA for 4 h was significantly suppressed by the treatment (Fig. 1C). We further investigated whether LTA induction of exocytosis was mediated through MyD88 and IRAK-1, common signaling molecules downstream of TLRs, because LTA is known as a TLR2 agonist. Interestingly, VWF release by stimulation with LTA for 60 min was suppressed by knockdown of the expression of MyD88 but not that of IRAK-1, whereas the release by stimulation with LTA for 4 h was significantly suppressed by each knockdown of MyD88 and IRAK-1 (Fig. 1C). Thus, these results suggest that LTA can induce Weibel-Palade body exocytosis through a MyD88-dependent rapid mechanism without de novo protein synthesis and an IRAK-1-dependent slower mechanism with de novo protein synthesis. We also examined whether other bacterial cell wall constituents, as shown in Table 1, activated induction of VWF release after stimulation of HAECs for 60 min. Among the compounds that we tested, the synthetic analogs of bacterial lipoproteins Pam3CSK4, FSL-1, and MALP-2 and, to a lesser extent, flagellin induced VWF release in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D, left). Interestingly, LPS from different bacterial species and PGN did not activate Weibel-Palade body exocytosis (Fig. 1D, left). In addition, we found that induction of exocytosis by bacterial compounds was also mediated by MyD88 as well as that by LTA (Fig. 1D, right). These results suggest that several types of, but not all, bacterial cell wall constituents can activate induction of TLR-MyD88-mediated exocytosis.TABLE 1Bacterial cell wall constituents used in this studySubstanceOrigin (Ref.)TLR recognition in human cells (Ref.)LTAS. aureusTLR2 (7Schroder N.W.

In addition, monocyte adhesion to HAECs was modestly increased in a MyD88-dependent fashion after LTA stimulation for 60 min (Fig. 2B). Stimulatory Activities of LPS and PGN in HAECs—As stated above, LPS did not activate Weibel-Palade body exocytosis (Fig. 1D). However, LPS potently activated induction of MyD88-dependent IL-8 production in HAECs after stimulation for 4 h (Fig. 3A). Thus, the results shown in Figs. 1D and 3A suggest that endothelial TLR4 lacks the ability to induce rapid Weibel-Palade body exocytosis without de novo protein synthesis. Similarly to LPS, PGN did not activate Weibel-Palade body exocytosis (Fig. 1D). Also, PGN did not induce IL-8 production after stimulation for 4 h in HAECs, whereas LTA did (Fig. 3A). However, our preparation of PGN had activities to induce TNF-α production in THP-1 monocytes (Fig. 3B) and TLR2- and MyD88-dependent activation of NF-κB in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3C) in a way similar to that in the case of other TLR2 agonists. These results suggest that HAECs lack the ability to respond to PGN. Induction of Weibel-Palade Body Exocytosis through TLR2— We then focused on LTA- and bacterial lipopeptide-induced Weibel-Palade body exocytosis. It has been reported that LTA and bacterial lipopeptides are TLR2 agonists (Table 1). In HUVECs, the lipopeptide FSL-1 induced VWF release (Fig. 4A). We found that this response was enhanced by increased expression of TLR2 by gene transfection (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that TLR2 recognition of bacterial constituents directly activates Weibel-Palade body exocytosis. Moreover, transfection of mutated TLR2 (P681H), which lacks the ability to interact with MyD88 (26Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), suppressed the release (Fig. 4B), consistent with the results presented in Figs. 1D and 2A showing that MyD88 was involved in the induction of Weibel-Palade exocytosis. In HAECs, knockdown of TLR2 expression resulted in almost complete suppression of VWF release by Pam3CSK4, FSL-1, MALP-2, and LTA (Fig. 4B). Moreover, knockdown of TLR6 expression resulted in a decrease in the activities of LTA, FSL-1, and MALP-2 and even that of Pam3CSK4 (Fig. 4B). In contrast to this, TLR1 interference did not affect VWF release (Fig. 4B), consistent with our observation that HAECs express very low levels of TLR1 mRNA compared with the levels of TLR2 mRNA (data not shown). These results suggest that endothelial recognition of pathogens by TLR2, or to a lesser extent by TLR6, contributes to induction of Weibel-Palade body exocytosis. Involvement of PLCγ Activation in Weibel-Palade Body Exocytosis— Recent studies have shown that TLR2 signal transduction results in an increase of intracellular calcium level (27Chun J. Prince A. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1330-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 28Supajatura V. Ushio H. Nakao A. Akira S. Okumura K. Ra C. Ogawa H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM suppressed LTA-induced exocytosis (Fig. 5A). We therefore examined the role of PLCγ, a common regulator of intracellular calcium release by generating inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (29Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.S. Kim S.R. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), during TLR2-mediated Weibel-Palade body exocytosis. We found that the PLCγ inhibitor U-73122 significantly suppressed TLR2 agonist-induced VWF release (Fig. 5B). Because PLCγ isoforms are thought to be activated by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, the product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) (29Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.S. Kim S.R. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), TLR2-mediated exocytosis was suppressed by the chemical inhibitor of PI3K LY294002 (data not shown). However, downstream of TLR/IL-1R"
https://openalex.org/W1999356033,"Membrane-permeable calmodulin inhibitors, such as the napthalenesulfonamide derivatives W-7/W-13, trifluoperazine, and calmidazolium, are used widely to investigate the role of calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) in living cells. If two chemically different inhibitors (e.g. W-7 and trifluoperazine) produce similar effects, investigators often assume the effects are due to CaM inhibition. Zeta potential measurements, however, show that these amphipathic weak bases bind to phospholipid vesicles at the same concentrations as they inhibit Ca2+/CaM; this suggests that they also bind to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, reducing its negative electrostatic surface potential. This change will cause electrostatically bound clusters of basic residues on peripheral (e.g. Src and K-Ras4B) and integral (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)) proteins to translocate from the membrane to the cytoplasm. We measured inhibitor-mediated translocation of a simple basic peptide corresponding to the calmodulin-binding juxtamembrane region of the EGFR on model membranes; W-7/W-13 causes translocation of this peptide from membrane to solution, suggesting that caution must be exercised when interpreting the results obtained with these inhibitors in living cells. We present evidence that they exert dual effects on autophosphorylation of EGFR; W-13 inhibits epidermal growth factor-dependent EGFR autophosphorylation under different experimental conditions, but in the absence of epidermal growth factor, W-13 stimulates autophosphorylation of the receptor in four different cell types. Our interpretation is that the former effect is due to W-13 inhibition of Ca2+/CaM, but the latter results could be due to binding of W-13 to the plasma membrane. Membrane-permeable calmodulin inhibitors, such as the napthalenesulfonamide derivatives W-7/W-13, trifluoperazine, and calmidazolium, are used widely to investigate the role of calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) in living cells. If two chemically different inhibitors (e.g. W-7 and trifluoperazine) produce similar effects, investigators often assume the effects are due to CaM inhibition. Zeta potential measurements, however, show that these amphipathic weak bases bind to phospholipid vesicles at the same concentrations as they inhibit Ca2+/CaM; this suggests that they also bind to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, reducing its negative electrostatic surface potential. This change will cause electrostatically bound clusters of basic residues on peripheral (e.g. Src and K-Ras4B) and integral (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)) proteins to translocate from the membrane to the cytoplasm. We measured inhibitor-mediated translocation of a simple basic peptide corresponding to the calmodulin-binding juxtamembrane region of the EGFR on model membranes; W-7/W-13 causes translocation of this peptide from membrane to solution, suggesting that caution must be exercised when interpreting the results obtained with these inhibitors in living cells. We present evidence that they exert dual effects on autophosphorylation of EGFR; W-13 inhibits epidermal growth factor-dependent EGFR autophosphorylation under different experimental conditions, but in the absence of epidermal growth factor, W-13 stimulates autophosphorylation of the receptor in four different cell types. Our interpretation is that the former effect is due to W-13 inhibition of Ca2+/CaM, but the latter results could be due to binding of W-13 to the plasma membrane.

Many investigators have used membrane-permeable calmodulin inhibitors (e.g. trifluoperazine (TFP), calmidazolium (CDZ), and the napthalenesulfonamide derivatives W-7/W-13) to sort out the multiple potential roles of calmodulin in living cells; a PubMed search for W-7 alone turns up 1,700 publications. Frequently, investigators reason that if two or more chemically distinct inhibitors (e.g. W-7 and TFP) produce similar effects on a cell, they can assume that the effects are due to specific inhibition of calmodulin. If, however, these amphipathic weak bases bind to Ca2+/CaM mainly through nonspecific hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, they also will bind to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane at about the same concentration at which they inhibit calmodulin. This binding reduces the net negative charge on the inner leaflet, which is due mainly to the monovalent acidic lipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphati-dylserine (PS). Decreasing the net negative charge on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane can have several biological effects. For example, it could reduce the electrostatically mediated (7McLaughlin S.

We investigated whether commonly used membrane-permeable calmodulin inhibitors bind to phospholipid vesicles formed with the same mole fraction of PS present in the inner leaflet of a typical mammalian plasma membrane. They do. For example, ∼10 μm W-7 or W-13 reduces the negative zeta potential of a phospholipid vesicle significantly and induces membrane-bound basic peptide translocation from membrane to solution, as determined by both centrifugation and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements; the same inhibitor concentration binds to and inhibits Ca2+/CaM. Our results suggest that these inhibitors bind both to Ca2+/CaM and to membranes in cells. We investigated the dual effects of Ca2+/CaM inhibitors on an important cellular process, EGFR activation. Exposing cells to EGF produces receptor dimerization (11Ferguson K.M. Biochem. Soc.

We hypothesize that this transient increase in Ca2+/CaM could be important in EGFR activation, because Ca2+/CaM binds both to the EGFR (18Li H. Villalobo A. Biochem.

Smith S.O. Hayman M.J. Murray D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) to suggest that this interaction could be biologically relevant. A recent report provides important evidence that ligand-mediated activation of EGFR involves dimer formation between two kinase domains, which stimulates rearrangement of the activation loop within the kinase domain by an allosteric mechanism (22Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2006; 125: 1137-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar, 23Hubbard S.R.

Ca2+/CaM, for example, could facilitate formation of the kinase domain dimers by enhancing desorption of the JM plus kinase domains from the cytoplasmic leaflet (7McLaughlin S. Murray D.

Physiol. 2005; 126: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and unpublished work showed that treating cells with appropriate concentrations of W-7, W-13, and the less potent W-12 inhibits the initial transient phase of EGF-stimulated intermolecular EGFR autophosphorylation (hereafter referred to as autophosphorylation) in five different cell types. We report new experiments that provide additional evidence that W-13 inhibits this phase of EGF-mediated autophosphorylation by inhibiting Ca2+/CaM in cells exposed to a calcium ionophore. These results support the hypothesis that Ca2+/CaM is involved in the initial phase of ligand-mediated EGFR activation in several cell types. Introducing a mutation that impedes Ca2+/CaM binding to the EGFR JM domain abrogates W-13-mediated inhibition of EGFR autophosphorylation, which suggests that Ca2+/CaM interacts directly with the EGFR. W-7 and W-13, however, exert an opposing effect that appears not to be restricted to their ability to inhibit Ca2+/CaM; measurements on four different cell types show that W-13 stimulates autophosphorylation of EGFR in the absence of EGF, confirming and extending earlier work (21McLaughlin S. Smith S.O. Hayman M.J. Murray D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26Tebar F. Villalonga P. Sorkina T. Agell N. Sorkin A. Enrich C. Mol. Biol.

We discuss how the membrane binding of W-7 and W-13 could produce this effect. Electrostatic Potentials Adjacent to Membranes and Determination of the Zeta Potential—Fixed negative charges on the inner leaflet of a typical mammalian plasma membrane are due mainly to the presence of monovalent acidic lipids, such as PS, which accounts for 20-35% of these phospholipids (28Holthuis J.C. Levine T.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Most other lipids are neutral (e.g. cholesterol) or zwitterionic (e.g. 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine); positive lipids are rare or absent. The fixed charges on PS (red circles at left in Fig. 1A) attract ions of opposite charge, K+ (blue circles), from the aqueous phase; these counterions form an ion atmosphere, as shown in Fig. 1A. Helmholtz in 1879 (29Helmholtz H.L. Ann. Phys. Leipzig. 1879; 7: 337-382Crossref Scopus (534) Google Scholar) first recognized that the fixed charges and counterions “form an electrical double layer... that has an extraordinarily small, but not disappearing thickness”; double layer theory is discussed in detail in an excellent modern physical chemical text (30Dill K. Bromberg S. Molecular Driving Forces, Garland Science, New York. 2003; : 369-447Google Scholar) and reviews of membrane electrostatics (e.g. Refs. 31McLaughlin S. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1977; 19: 71-144Crossref Scopus (777) Google Scholar and 32McLaughlin S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar and references therein). The essential features are summarized very briefly below and in Fig. 1. The thickness of the ion atmosphere adjacent to the inner leaflet is about 1 nm = 10 Aå. The counterions do not stick to the membrane surface for the same reason the gas molecules in the earth’s atmosphere do not fall to the ground; they diffuse away from a region of high concentration. Gouy and Chapman used the Poisson equation to describe the electrostatic attraction of the counterions for the charged surface and the Boltzmann equation to describe the statistical distribution of the counter- and co-ions in the aqueous diffuse double layer; Fig. 1, B and C, illustrates two key predictions of the Gouy-Chapman theory. When the surface potential, ψ(0), is small, it is proportional to both the surface charge density, σ (number of fixed charges per unit area of surface), and the Debye length, ψ(0)=σ/ɛ1ɛ0κEq. 1 where ɛr is the dielectric constant or relative permittivity (∼80), ɛo is the permittivity of free space, and 1/κ is the Debye length (∼1 nm for 0.1 m salt; ∼10 nm for 0.001 m salt). Note that this limiting form of the Gouy equation also describes the potential difference between two capacitor plates with charge density σ separated by a distance 1/κ (see Fig. 1C). Equation 1 and the simple capacitor model illustrate the following two important features of double layer theory. The surface potential increases with increasing density of fixed charge (i.e. fraction of acidic lipids increases) and/or Debye length (i.e. salt concentration decreases). Fig. 1B shows the dependence of potential on distance. When the potential in the aqueous phase is small, it falls with distance x from the surface according to Equation 2. ψ(x)=ψ(0)exp(-κx)Eq. 2 Numerous experimental studies have shown that this theory provides a surprisingly accurate description of the potential adjacent to a phospholipid bilayer membrane (32McLaughlin S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The Helmholtz-Smoluchowski equation gives the relationship between the measured electrophoretic mobility, μ (velocity of a multilamellar vesicle in a unit electric field), and the zeta potential, ζ, ζ=μη/(ɛ1ɛo)Eq. 3 where η is the viscosity of the aqueous solution, ɛr is the dielectric constant (∼80) and ɛo is the permittivity of free space. By definition, ζ is the potential at the hydrodynamic plane of shear, which experiments suggest is located about 0.2 nm from the surface (see Fig. 1B) in a 100 mm salt solution (32McLaughlin S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The experimental aspects of determining the electrophoretic mobility are considered in detail elsewhere (33Cafiso D. McLaughlin A. McLaughlin S. Winiski A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 171: 342-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For the experiments shown in Figs. 3 and 4, we added the inhibitor in excess concentration relative to the lipids ([lipid] < 1 μm), so the binding of inhibitor to the vesicles does not significantly decrease its free concentration in solution.FIGURE 4Effect of TFP and CDZ on the zeta potentials of phospholipid vesicles. TFP binds equally well to 2:1 PC/PS (black diamonds) and 2:1 PC/PG (white diamonds) vesicles through a combination of nonspecific hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. It binds to PC vesicles (gray diamonds) through hydrophobic interactions only. CDZ binds strongly to the 2:1 PC/PS vesicles (white triangles); 1 μm CDZ reverses the charge on 2:1 PC/PS vesicles and produces a positive zeta potential (ζ =+17 mV).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reagents—Fig. 2 shows the chemical structures of five commonly used membrane-permeable calmodulin inhibitors. The naphthalenesulfonamide derivatives (W-7, W-12, and W-13), trifluoperazine (TFP), and calmidazolium (CDZ) are all amphipathic weak bases. (As discussed in the supplemental materials, the neutral form of these weak bases equilibrates between the bathing solution and cytoplasm.) W-7, W-13, and W-12 were purchased from both Sigma and Calbiochem. Similar results (zeta potential and peptide binding to large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs)) were obtained with both samples. CDZ, TFP, and rhodamine green were purchased from Sigma. The phospholipids PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and PS were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Peptides corresponding to the JM region of EGFR (EGFR-(645-660)), with and without a Cys residue at the N terminus, were purchased from American Peptide Co. (Sunnyvale, CA). Alexa-488 maleimide was purchased from Invitrogen. Radioactively labeled [dioleoyl-1-14C]l-α-dio-leoylphosphatidylcholine and [ethyl-1, 2-3H]N-ethylmaleimide were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cell culture media and sera were purchased from Invitrogen or Biological Industries (Beit Haemek, Israel). Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine RC20 antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was from Transduction Laboratories/BD Biosciences. A23187, ionomycin, and KN-93 were from Calbiochem. GF109203X and Fast Green FCF were from Sigma. The enhanced chemiluminescent Luminol (ECL™) reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Pall Gelman Laboratory (Ann Arbor, MI), and Immobilon-P filters were from Millipore Corp. (Billerica, MA). Vesicle Preparation—We used 100-nm diameter LUVs for the FCS and centrifugation-binding experiments, as described in detail elsewhere (34Wang J. Arbuzova A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5012-5019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, we added a mixture of solutions of PC and PS in chloroform to a 50-ml round-bottom flask, which was then immersed in a 30-35 °C water bath and attached to a rotary evaporator. The flask was rotated without vacuum for ∼5 min to warm the flask and solution. We then evaporated most of the solvent rapidly by applying the maximum vacuum that does not boil the chloroform. The flask was kept under full vacuum for 30 min to remove all traces of chloroform. A solution (typically containing 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0) was added to form multilamellar vesicles (MLVs), followed by five cycles of rapid freezing and thawing. We formed LUVs by extruding the MLVs through 100-nm diameter polycarbonate filters. (A solution containing 176 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, was used to obtain sucrose-loaded LUVs for centrifugation binding measurements. The solution bathing the LUVs was then exchanged for 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.) We used MLVs, which typically had a diameter of 10-20 μm for electrophoretic mobility/zeta potential measurements. Peptide Labeling and Purification—Labeled or unlabeled peptides used for experiments were determined to be >95% pure by HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. We used a protocol modified from Ref. 36Golebiewska U.P. Gambhir A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Zaitseva I. Raedler J. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 588-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar to label the peptides with the thiol-reactive fluorescent probes. In brief, we mixed 1 ml of 1mm peptide in 10 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.0, with the probe dissolved in N,N-dimethyl formamide (probe/peptide molar ratio 1:1) for 1 h. We purified the labeled peptide using HPLC and checked that it has the correct molecular weight using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Proteomics Center, State University of New York at Stony Brook). We labeled the peptides with [ethyl-1,2-3H]N-ethylmaleimide as described previously (34Wang J. Arbuzova A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. McLaughlin S. J. Biol.

Centrifugation Measurements—We measured the binding of EGFR-(645-660) peptides to sucrose-loaded PC/PS LUVs using a centrifugation technique described previously (21McLaughlin S. Smith S.O. Hayman M.J. Murray D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Wang J. Arbuzova A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. McLaughlin S. J. Biol.

Briefly, sucrose-loaded PC/PS LUVs (20 μm lipid for data in Fig. 5) were mixed with trace concentrations of [ethyl-1,2-3H]N-ethylmaleimide-labeled peptides (typically 2-10 nm). The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. We calculated the percentage of peptide bound by measuring the radio-activity of the peptide in the supernatant and in the pellet. FCS Measurements and Data Analysis/Interpretation—Information about the size of a particle (e.g. free versus vesicle-bound peptide) can be obtained by measuring its diffusion constant D and using the Stokes-Einstein relationship, D=kT/(6πηR)Eq. 1 where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, η is the viscosity of the medium, and R is the hydrodynamic radius of the diffusing particle. We can determine D by measuring the residence time τD of a particle diffusing through a small observation volume of radius r and using the Einstein relation for diffusion, r2=4DτDEq. 5 FCS measures the residence time, τD of molecules diffusing through a small, optically defined, open probe volume using sensitive fluorescence detection (38Magde D. Elson E.L. Webb W.W. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 29-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 39Maiti S. Haupts U. Webb W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Opt. 2004; 9: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 illustrates the principle of FCS and how this technique can be used to measure the binding of fluorescently labeled EGFR-(645-660) to negatively charged phospholipid vesicles (35Rusu L. Gambhir A. McLaughlin S. Radler J. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1044-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Fig. 6B shows a schematic diagram of free and LUV-bound peptides undergoing Brownian motion in the laser focus volume; the fluorescence signal from this probe volume fluctuates as the molecules diffuse in and out of it. This fluorescence fluctuation is recorded with an avalanche photodiode detector with good temporal resolution and then analyzed by a digital temporal correlator to compute the autocorrelation function G(τ), the measured variable for FCS experiments, as described in the supplemental materials. Fig. 6, C and D, shows the fluorescence time traces and the autocorrelation functions calculated from those time traces, respectively, using the same color coding. We can extract the characteristic residence time, τD, of a molecule (i.e. the average time the molecule takes to diffuse in and out of the ∼300-nm diameter probe volume) by fitting the autocorrelation functions to the appropriate equation. Because the LUV-bound peptides diffuse more slowly than free peptides, the autocorrelation function decays on a longer time scale, and the correlation time is ∼25-fold longer. It is easy to distinguish the bound and free species when τD(bound) is ≫τD(free). Cell Cultures—N7XHERc fibroblasts, a stable transfected cell line expressing the wild type human EGFR, was donated by Axel Ullrich from the Max-Planck-Institut fuör Biochemie (Martinsried, Germany), and RI1 fibroblasts, a stable transfected cell line expressing a human EGFR mutant with an insertion of a highly acidic 23-amino acid sequence between Arg647 and His648, which divides the CaM-binding domain into two segments (42Sorokin A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1531-1540PubMed Google Scholar), was a kind gift of Andrey Sorokin from the Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI). N7XHERc, N7XHERc/654A, RI1, EGFR-T17 (stably transfected mouse fibroblasts overexpressing human EGFR), and green monkey kidney COS-1 cells (expressing 4 × 105 EGFR/cell) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 5 mm pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 40 μg/ml gentamicin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2 at 37 °C. Mouse NIH3T3 (clone WT8) fibroblasts (expressing 4 × 105 EGFRs/cell) (43Sorkin A. Mazzotti M. Sorkina T. Scotto L. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13377-13384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) were grown as above except that 10% (v/v) donor calf serum was used. Porcine aortic endothelial (PAE/EGFR-GFP) cells, a stable transfected cell line expressing a human EGFR-green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimera (2 × 105 EGFR-GFP/cell) (44Carter R.E. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35000-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), were grown in F-12 medium with the supplements indicated above. Cells were counted using a Neubauer’s chamber after detachment from the culture dishes and seeded in 6-well plates (1.4 × 105 cells/well) in the media indicated above and grown to ∼90% confluence for 24 h. Thereafter, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, and 10 mm Na2HPO4 at pH 7.4) and maintained overnight in a serum-free medium before performing the experiments. Measurement of EGFR Autophosphorylation—EGF-dependent EGFR autophosphorylation was measured upon the addition of 10 nm EGF to serum-starved cells in multiwell plates containing 2 ml of medium. Depending on the experiment (see legends to Figs. 7 and S1), the medium also contained a calcium/calmodulin-activated kinase II inhibitor, a protein kinase C inhibitor, the CaM inhibitor W-13, and a Ca2+ ionophore.

Since collagen turnover by phagocytosis is an important pathway for matrix remodeling, we studied the effect of the bacterial and eukaryotic cell metabolite, methylglyoxal (MGO), on the binding step of phagocytosis by periodontal fibroblasts. Type 1 collagen was treated with various concentrations of methylglyoxal, an important glucose metabolite that modifies Arg and Lys residues. The extent of MGO-induced modifications was authenticated by amino acid analysis, solubility, and cross-linking. Cells were incubated with fluorescent beads coated with collagen, and the percentage of phagocytic cells was estimated by flow cytometry. MGO inhibited collagen binding (20% of control for 10 mm MGO) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. MGO-induced inhibition of binding was prevented by aminoguanidine, which blocks the formation of collagen cross-links. MGO reduced collagen binding strength and blocked intracellular calcium signaling. MGO modified the Arg residue in the critical α2β1 integrin-binding recognition sequence of triple helical collagen peptides, whereas MGO-induced cross-linking of Lys residues played only a small role in binding inhibition. Thus, MGO modifications of Arg residues in collagen could be a key factor in the impaired degradation of collagen that promotes fibrosis in chronic infections, such as periodontitis.

Thus, MGO modifications of Arg residues in collagen could be a key factor in the impaired degradation of collagen that promotes fibrosis in chronic infections, such as periodontitis. Connective tissue homeostasis is maintained by fibroblasts that can synthesize and degrade the collagenous matrix in response to changes in physiological and pathological conditions. Disruptions to the balance of matrix remodeling may lead to net loss of collagen or to disorganized overgrowth of collagen in several pathological conditions (1Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.

In chronic infections of connective tissues, such as periodontitis, bacterial cell metabolites (2Ferguson G.P. Booth I.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4314-4318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) disrupt matrix homeostasis and promote collagen loss and fibrosis in collagen-rich tissues (1Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K.

At least part of this loss of homeostasis has been attributed to infection-induced increase of collagen synthesis and impaired collagen degradation (3Moskow B.S. Polson A.M. J. Clin. Periodontol. 1991; 18: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Chou D.H. Lee W. McCulloch C.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4354-4362PubMed Google Scholar). Although an intracellular phagocytic pathway of collagen degradation by fibroblasts is known to be important for maintaining homeostasis in mature connective tissues (5Everts V. van der Zee E. Creemers L. Beertsen W. Histochem. J. 1996; 28: 229-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), the effect of bacterial and eukaryotic cell metabolites on collagen phagocytosis has not been defined. The recognition and binding of collagen molecules by cell surface receptors is the initial, rate-limiting step in collagen phagocytosis by fibroblasts. The principal receptor for type I fibrillar collagen is the α2β1 integrin (6Gullberg D. Gehlsen K.R. Turner D.C. Ahlen K. Zijenah L.S. Barnes M.J. Rubin K.

Each subunit exhibits a large extracellular domain, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a small cytoplasmic tail. The N terminus of the integrin α2-subunit encompasses a 7-fold repeat. Between repeats II and III, as well as in several other α-subunits, are an additional 200 amino acids designated as the A (or I) domain (13Shaw S.K. Cepek K.L. Murphy E.A. Russell G.J. Brenner M.B.

Prolonged exposure of collagen to bacterial and eukaryotic cell glucose metabolites affects collagen structure by forming intermolecular cross-links that can reduce the flexibility of connective tissues and reduce matrix turnover (17Bailey A.J. Paul R.G. Knott L. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1998; 106: 1-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Notably, MGO has been detected in the fluid draining from periodontitis infections (18Kashket S. Maiden M.F. Haffajee A.D. Kashket E.R. J. Clin. Periodontol. 2003; 30: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but the effect of MGO-induced modifications on the binding and internalization steps of collagen phagocytosis (which rely on the α2β1 integrin) has not been investigated. To define a potential role for phagocytosis in periodontitis-induced pathologies of connective tissues, we assessed the effect of MGO treatment of collagen on the α2β1 integrin-dependent binding step of collagen phagocytosis. Since collagen turnover in periodontal connective tissues is faster than in any other human tissue yet studied (19Sodek J. Ferrier J.M. Collagen Relat. Res. 1988; 8: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and since cultured periodontal fibroblasts primarily express the α2β1 integrin (20Lee W. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Physiol. 1996; 168: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we used cells from the periodontium as a model system for defining the critical, rate-limiting steps in collagen phagocytosis. Here we provide evidence that MGO-induced modifications of the Gly-Phe-Hyp-Gly-Glu-Arg motif in collagen inhibit the collagen binding step of phagocytosis. These data suggest a mechanism that explains how chronic bacterial infection in close proximity to connective tissues dysregulates collagen degradation, thereby leading to loss of connective tissue homeostasis. Reagents—Latex (2-μm diameter) beads were purchased from Polysciences (Warrington, PA). Antibodies to β-actin (clone AC-15), TRITC-phalloidin, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), d-ribose, MGO (Sigma catalogue number M0252), aminoguanidine, and maleic anhydride were from Sigma. Bovine serum albumin was purchased from Calbiochem. Carboxyl ferromagnetic beads (2-2.9 μm) were purchased from Spherotech (Libertyville, IL). Triple helical collagen peptides (36 amino acids) mimicking the α2β1 integrin binding site of collagen were obtained from Dr. G. Fields (Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL). Bacterial collagenase was from Worthington. Activating α2 integrin antibody (JBS2) and antibody to α2 integrin (AB1936) were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Activating β1 integrin antibody (CD29 mouse anti-human) was obtained from Serotec (Raleigh, NC). Antibody to the discoidin domain receptor 1 (c-20/sc-532) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody to β1 integrin (4B4) was from Beckman-Coulter (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Antibody to α2 integrin (P1E6) was from Chemicon. Antibody to methylglyoxal-AGE (Arg-pyrimidine) was from Biologo (Germany). The protein cross-linker p-azidophenyl glyoxal monohydrate (APG) was obtained from Pierce. Cell Culture and Human Gingival Tissues—Human gingival fibroblasts (passages 4-10) were derived from primary explant cultures as described previously (21Pender N. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 187-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium, 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and 10% antibiotics, maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2, and were passaged with 0.01% trypsin. Rat-2 fibroblasts (ATCC CRL 1764; American Type Culture Collection) were subcultured from frozen stocks and incubated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (high glucose) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Discoidin domain receptor 1+/+ (DDR1+/+) and DDR1-/- fibroblasts (kindly donated by W. Vogel (University of Toronto) were passaged with 0.25% trypsin plus 1 mm EDTA and grown in similar medium as above. For examination of MGO-induced alterations of tissues in situ, biopsies of human gingiva from healthy and periodontitis-affected human subjects were obtained (n = 3 subjects each) and fixed with paraformaldehyde, and histological sections were prepared for immunostaining. The biopsies were obtained with informed consent according to the specifications of the Health Sciences Research Ethics Board at the University of Toronto. Collagen Beads—Collagen-coated latex beads were prepared as previously described (20Lee W. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Physiol. 1996; 168: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, beads were incubated with 1 ml of an acidic solution of bovine type I collagen (2.9 mg/ml; Vitrogen, Cohesion Technologies), neutralized with 100 μl of 1 n NaOH to pH 7.4 to facilitate fibril formation on the beads, vortexed, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. This time period is known to allow stable fibril formation on the beads (22Knowles G.C. McKeown M. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 551-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BSA-coated beads were prepared by incubating latex beads with 1 ml of 1% (w/v) BSA for 30 min at 37 °C. The beads were pelleted, incubated with control or MGO-containing medium (see below), sonicated in solution for 10 s, and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Collagen was treated with 0.1, 1, or 10 mm MGO diluted in PBS overnight or up to 5 days at 37 °C. In some experiments, collagen was glycated with 0.5 m d-ribose for up to 5 days at 37 °C. Control collagen was prepared in parallel in Mg2+-, Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for both methods. After incubation, the beads were pelleted, washed with PBS, resuspended in PBS, and counted prior to incubation with cells. Evaluation of equal loading of collagen on beads was done by immunoblotting of bead-associated collagen as described (23Bhide V.M. Laschinger C.A. Arora P.D. Lee W. Hakkinen L. Larjava H. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23103-23113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For assessment of bead-associated proteins, identical procedures were used, except proteins were coated on magnetite beads. Inhibition of MGO-induced cross-linking was obtained by aminoguanidine (20 mm) co-incubation of collagen-coated beads overnight. Analysis of Cross-linked Collagen—The relative abundance of cross-linking after MGO was estimated by analysis of hydroxyproline content after solubilization of collagen by pepsin digestion (50 μg of pepsin/ml in 0.5 n acetic acid, 23 °C, 16 h) followed by amino acid analysis using high pressure liquid chromatography (Alliance 1690; Waters; Milford, MA; Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). For SDS-PAGE, sample buffer (50 μl; 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol) was added to control, collagen-coated beads or MGO-treated beads. Samples were prepared by heating beads to 50 °C for 30 min, and the eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide) followed by silver staining. Adhesion Assays and Flow Cytometry—Cells were counted electronically, and collagen beads (yellow-green fluorescent beads; Exmax = 485 nm, Emmax = 515 nm) were loaded on to the top (i.e. dorsal) surfaces of cells at a 6:1 bead/cell ratio. After incubation of beads with cells for defined time periods, cells were washed (PBS), detached with 0.01% trypsin from culture dishes, and resuspended in PBS, a process that removes loosely attached, nonspecifically bound beads (24McKeown M. Knowles G. McCulloch C.A. Cell Tissue Res. 1990; 262: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Segal G. Lee W. Arora P.D. McKee M. Downey G. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 119-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of cells were analyzed for bead binding by flow cytometry (Beckman-Coulter Altra, Miami, FL) to estimate the percentage of cells with bound fluorescent beads and the relative number of beads per cell. For β1 or α2 integrin-blocking experiments, cells were preincubated with 4B4 antibody (1 μg/ml) or P1E6 (2 μg/ml), respectively, incubated with beads for 1 h, washed with PBS, trypsinized, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Similarly, for α2 and β1 integrin activation, JBS2 mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml) or CD29 mouse anti-human (10 μg/ml) was added prior to collagen-coated bead exposure and flow cytometry analysis as described (4Chou D.H. Lee W. McCulloch C.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4354-4362PubMed Google Scholar). Evaluation of collagen bead internalization was conducted as previously described (11Arora P.D. Glogauer M. Kapus A. Kwiatkowski D.J. McCulloch C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 588-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, fluorescein isothiocyanate/collagen-coated beads were incubated for specific times with cells, and subsequent internalization was blocked by cooling on ice. Fluorescence from extracellular beads was quenched by trypan blue, thereby permitting fluorescence microscopic discrimination and quantification of external (quenched) and internalized (nonquenched) beads. Binding Strength Assay—The relative binding strength of collagen beads to cells was estimated by a shear wash assay (4Chou D.H. Lee W. McCulloch C.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4354-4362PubMed Google Scholar, 26Batista da Silva A.P. Lee W. Bajenova E. McCulloch C.A. Ellen R.P. Cell Microbiol. 2004; 6: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in which binding of beads to cells was examined in situ. Cells grown in monolayer culture (24-well plates) were incubated with control or glycated collagen-coated fluorescence beads for 1 h and subjected to increasing numbers of washes with PBS from 1 to 32 washes with a repeating pipettor (Eppendorf). Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with Triton X-100, washed with PBS, stained with DAPI (5 μg/ml), and air-dried. DAPI-stained nuclei were used to identify the location of each cell, and the number of bound beads associated with each cell was counted by fluorescence microscopy in a 5-mm wide circular zone in the middle of the well. For each experiment, at least 50 cells were counted in each well, and four wells were evaluated for each experiment. The experiment was repeated three times. During washing with the pipette, cells adhered to the bottom of the culture dish experience local shear stress due to radial outflow of the ejected fluid over the cell layer. The shear stress on the cells can be approximated for wall shear stress produced by the normal impingement of an axi-symmetric jet on a planar surface. According to Phares et al. (27Phares D.J. Smedley G.T. Flagan R.C. J. Fluid Mech. 2000; 418: 351-375Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar), the wall shear stress varies radially outward from the stagnation point (the point at which the jet initially hits the cell surface), increasing to a maximum value (τmax) governed by the following. τmax=44.5ρu02Re0-1/2(HD)-2Eq. 1 In this equation, ρ represents the fluid density, H is the jet height from the planar surface, D is the nozzle diameter, u0 is the jet exit velocity, and Re0 = u0D/ν is the jet Reynolds number, where ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity. This maximum shear stress occurs at a radial distance of rmax = 0.09H from the jet axis (27Phares D.J. Smedley G.T. Flagan R.C. J. Fluid Mech. 2000; 418: 351-375Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the pipette tip diameter was D ∼ 0.8 mm, the volumetric flow rate was Q ∼ 250 μl/s, jet height was estimated to be H ∼ 10 mm, and fluid properties were approximately those of water. Thus, u0 ∼ 0.5 m/s and Re0 ∼ 400, resulting in a maximum shear stress of τmax ∼ 3.5 pascals (or 35 dynes/cm2) at rmax ∼ 0.9 mm. Cell Spreading—Type I fibrillar collagen-coated plates (Biocoat Cell Environments; BD Biosciences) were treated overnight with MGO or with control vehicle. Cells were plated and spread for 1, 2, and 4 h, washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (5 μm). Cells were washed and air-dried, and coverslips were mounted with anti-fade solution. Cells were photographed, and projected surface areas were measured by digital morphometry. [Ca2+]i Measurements—Nonfluorescent latex beads were coated with collagen and glycated overnight with MGO. Beads were applied to cells that were loaded with fura 2/acetoxymethyl ester (3 μm). Intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured with a microscope-based, ratio fluorimeter over time (28Arora P.D. Bibby K.J. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Physiol. 1994; 161: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Only cells that exhibited bound collagen-coated beads were measured. Immunoblotting—Cells were spread over type I collagen or MGO-treated collagen-coated plates for specific time periods. After spreading, cells were washed with PBS and extracted with SDS-sample buffer. Protein concentrations were measured with the Bio-Rad assay using BSA as a standard. The relative amounts of proteins were normalized for all samples. Proteins were separated on 7.5-10% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with appropriate antibodies for α2 integrin or DDR1. Immunoblots were developed by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Bead-associated proteins including integrins and DDR1 were analyzed as previously described (29Glogauer M. Arora P. Yao G. Sokholov I. Ferrier J. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, control and MGO-treated collagen-coated magnetite beads were added to cells for 1 h. After incubation, medium was removed, and the cells were washed to remove loosely bound beads. Cells and beads were scraped with cytoskeletal extraction buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 300 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm PIPES, and 1 μm phalloidin, pH 6.8). Magnetite beads were isolated with a magnet (Dynal) at 4 °C, washed with cytoskeletal extraction buffer, and pelleted, and bead-associated proteins were released during 20-s sonication in SDS-sample buffer. Beads were removed and counted to estimate relative protein concentrations in samples. Differences in the relative amounts of total proteins were normalized between samples, and proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Cross-linking of Collagen—Collagen-coated beads were incubated overnight at 37 °C with APG (10 mm; pH 7). Beads were incubated on ice, and cross-linking was activated by UV light (8 min; 2 × 15 watts at a distance of 5 cm) and verified by SDS-PAGE. The beads were pelleted and washed. Incubation of collagen beads with cells was performed as described above prior to flow cytometry analysis. Inhibition of MGO-induced Lysine Cross-linking of Collagen—Collagen-coated beads were treated with maleic anhydride to protect lysine sites from MGO-induced cross-linking. Collagen-coated beads were incubated overnight with MGO (10 mm; 37 °C). In some experiments, maleic anhydride protection was reversed by incubating beads at pH 9 prior to MGO treatment. Collagen bead binding methods were used as described above, followed by analysis with flow cytometry. Collagen beads treated with maleic anhydride alone served as controls. Mass Spectrometry—Triple helical collagen peptides encompassing the α2β1 integrin binding site of collagen (0.5 mg of peptide at 50 nm) were dissolved in PBS and treated overnight at 37 °C with 10 mm MGO. Excess reagent was removed using protein-desalting spin columns (Pierce) and equilibrated in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate. MGO-treated peptide (25 nm) was vacuum-dried prior to mass spectrometry (Hospital for Sick Children). The remaining 25 nm peptide was digested with trypsin (in 25 mm NH4HCO3) to give an E/S ratio of 1:500. The digestion was allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C, evaporated to dryness, and analyzed on a Micromass electrospray ionization quantitative time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled with a Waters CapLC high pressure liquid chromatography system (Hospital for Sick Children). Statistical Analyses—For all data sets, experiments were repeated at least three times, and each repeat contained three replicates. For quantitative data, means and S.E. were calculated. Comparisons between samples were performed using either Student’s t test or single factor analysis of variance followed by Scheffe’s test for individual differences. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Collagen Model System—We incubated collagen with MGO (30Paul R.G. Bailey A.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) for 19 h or with d-ribose for time periods up to 5 days (31Monnier V.M. Cerami A. Science. 1981; 211: 491-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 32Monnier V.M. Kohn R.R. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Treatment of collagen with d-ribose (5 days of treatment) inhibited collagen binding to cells (38.0 ± 3.5% of controls; n = 4; p < 0.01), but overnight treatments with MGO were more inhibitory (23.6 ± 11.1% of controls for 1 mm MGO; 14.4 ± 1.7% of controls for 10 mm MGO; n = 4; p < 0.001). All further experiments were performed with MGO-treated collagen, since the treatments were more efficacious and required less time. MGO-treated Collagen—The efficacy of the MGO treatment of collagen bound to beads was examined by amino acid analysis of eluted collagen from beads. With increasing concentrations of MGO, there were reduced ratios of Arg to hydroxyproline (Table 1). Since MGO treatment of Arg forms imidazolones that hydrolyze to ornithine (33Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54173-54184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we also measured ornithine/hydroxyproline ratios, which increased with higher concentrations of MGO. The solubility of MGO-treated collagen samples was tested by pepsin digestion, followed by measurement of hydroxyproline content in the soluble fraction. Complete solubilization of control collagen was obtained after 16-h pepsin treatment, whereas MGO-treated collagen (1 and 10 mm) showed limited solubilization, even after 24 h of pepsin digestion. Of the material that was solubilized in pepsin-digested fractions, there was much less hydroxyproline content after treatment with higher concentrations of MGO (Fig. 1A). From SDS-PAGE analysis, we also found evidence for higher molecular mass aggregates of collagen molecules after MGO treatment, which is suggestive of increased collagen cross-linking (Fig. 1B) or possibly altered charge profile due to MGO derivatization.TABLE 1MGO-induced modification of collagen[MGO]Arg/OH-Pro ratioOrnithine/OH-Pro ratiomm00.56 ± 0.070.003 ± 0.00110.30 ± 0.040.015 ± 0.004100.09 ± 0.030.031 ± 0.009 Open table in a new tab We examined human gingival tissue samples removed from either healthy (n = 3) or periodontitis-affected lesions (n = 3) and, following paraformaldehyde fixation, immunostained these samples for MGO adducts with a monoclonal antibody to methylglyoxal-AGE (Arg-pyrimidine). These samples showed strong staining of the connective tissues adjacent to infected periodontal pockets but not in healthy tissues (Fig. 1C). Binding Step of Phagocytosis—MGO treatment of collagen reduced collagen bead binding to cells to less than one-third of control values (Fig. 2A), and this effect was more pronounced at higher MGO doses (Fig. 2B; p < 0.01). These effects were not attributable to a loss of collagen from beads, since measurements of bead-bound collagen by dot blotting (23Bhide V.M. Laschinger C.A. Arora P.D. Lee W. Hakkinen L. Larjava H. Sodek J. McCulloch C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23103-23113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) showed equivalent amounts of bound collagen, independent of MGO treatment (0.026 pg of collagen/bead after incubation in 3 μm collagen solutions; 0.024 pg of collagen/bead after incubation in 3 μm collagen solutions followed by MGO treatment). Cells were also incubated with BSA-coated beads to assess the specificity of the MGO treatment effect. There were low percentages (∼10%) of cells that bound BSA-coated beads (Fig. 2A); however, MGO treatments of BSA-coated beads exerted no effect on the percentages of cells with bound BSA beads. Reduced collagen bead binding was also observed in Rat-2 fibroblasts at equivalent reductions as human gingival fibroblasts (Fig. 2B). We estimated collagen adhesion strength by comparing the relative proportion of cells that bound multiple beads when cells were incubated with beads at fixed bead/cell ratios. As reported earlier (11Arora P.D. Glogauer M. Kapus A. Kwiatkowski D.J. McCulloch C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 588-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), cells exhibited a range of collagen bead binding in that most cells bound one bead, but a small population could bind four or more beads, presumably reflecting intrinsic heterogeneity in the affinity of collagen receptors in the cell population. Notably, cultures of human gingival fibroblasts incubated with control collagen-coated beads showed higher percentages of cells with multiple bound beads compared with cultures exposed to MGO-treated collagen-coated beads, which usually exhibited binding of only one bead (Fig. 2C). These data indicated that MGO treatment may inhibit the binding strength of high affinity collagen receptors or that collagen beads may bind to each other under control conditions; conceivably, this interbead binding is inhibited by MGO. To examine these possibilities in more detail, we determined if beads adhered to each other under control and MGO conditions. At concentrations of beads that replicated the conditions used here but without cells, the distribution of bead interactions for untreated collagen beads was measured by flo"

Recently, we identified and characterized an ATP-dependent hexokinase (StHK) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus tokodaii, which can phosphorylate a broad range of sugar substrates, including glucose, mannose, glucosamine, and N-acetylglucosamine. Here we present the crystal structures of StHK in four different forms: (i) apo-form, (ii) binary complex with glucose, (iii) binary complex with ADP, and (iv) quaternary complex with xylose, Mg2+, and ADP. Forms i and iii are in the open state, and forms ii and iv are in the closed state, indicating that sugar binding induces a large conformational change, whereas ADP binding does not. The four different crystal structures of the same enzyme provide “snapshots” of the conformational changes during the catalytic cycle. StHK exhibits a core fold characteristic of the hexokinase family, but the structures of several loop regions responsible for substrate binding are significantly different from those of other known hexokinase family members. Structural comparison of StHK with human N-acetylglucosamine kinase and other hexokinases provides an explanation for the ability of StHK to phosphorylate both glucose and N-acetylglucosamine. A Mg2+ ion and coordinating water molecules are well defined in the electron density of the quaternary complex structure. This structure represents the first direct visualization of the binding mode for magnesium to hexokinase and thus allows for a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism proposed for the entire hexokinase family.

This structure represents the first direct visualization of the binding mode for magnesium to hexokinase and thus allows for a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism proposed for the entire hexokinase family. Phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate is important for both energy metabolism and biosynthesis in the cell. In eukaryotes, the reaction is catalyzed by hexokinases (EC 2.7.1.1), which can phosphorylate several hexoses, including mannose and fructose, in addition to glucose (1Cardenas M.L. Cornish-Bowden A. Ureta T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 242-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In contrast, bacteria possess glucokinases (EC 2.7.1.2) that are specific for glucose. Bacterial glucokinases can be classified into two groups as follows: (i) glucokinases belonging to the repressors/open reading frames of unknown function/sugar kinases (ROK) 2The abbreviations used are: ROK, repressors/open reading frames of unknown function/sugar kinases; StHK, S. tokodaii hexokinase; PEG, polyethylene glycol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; KDG, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate. 2The abbreviations used are: ROK, repressors/open reading frames of unknown function/sugar kinases; StHK, S. tokodaii hexokinase; PEG, polyethylene glycol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; KDG, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate. family, which is characterized by two signature motifs (2Titgemeyer F.

On the other hand, most Archaea use two types of glucokinase as follows: (i) ADP-dependent glucokinases (4Kengen S.W. Tuininga J.E. de Bok F.A. Stams A.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol.

Sander C. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar).

These molecules possess an identical core structure consisting of two domains with the βββαβαβα fold and the active site located between the two domains. Two β-turns formed by the conserved DXGGT and GTG motifs are involved in ATP binding. The hexokinase family is included in the ASKHA (acetate and sugar kinases/Hsp70/actin) superfamily (29Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7290-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 30Hurley J.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1996; 25: 137-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), the members of which have a common core fold and catalyze phosphoryl transfer or hydrolysis of ATP.In the past, ATP-dependent glucose phosphorylating activity had been detected in cell extracts of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (31De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Nicolaus B. Giardina P. Poerio E. Buonocore V. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), but no homologs of known hexokinases and glucokinases have been found in the genomes of the Sulfolobus species (32Chen L. Brugger K. Skovgaard M. Redder P. She Q. Torarinsson E. Greve B. Awayez M. Zibat A. Klenk H.P. Garrett R.A. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4992-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 33She Q. Singh R.K.

Kikuchi H. DNA Res. 2001; 8: 123-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Recently, we purified the ATP-dependent glucose phosphorylating activity from cell extracts of Sulfolobus tokodaii and identified the gene responsible for the activity (35Nishimasu H. Fushinobu S. Shoun H. Wakagi T. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2014-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our kinetic analyses indicated that S. tokodaii hexokinase (StHK) is a novel hexokinase that can phosphorylate not only glucose but also GlcNAc, glucosamine, and mannose. The enzyme differs from other known hexokinases and glucokinases in that its activity is strongly inhibited by ADP. StHK shows ∼25% amino acid sequence identity with mammalian GlcNAc kinases (supplemental Fig. S1). However, StHK is distinct in its broad substrate specificity from the GlcNAc kinases (36Hinderlich S. Nohring S. Weise C. Franke P. Stasche R. Reutter W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 37Hinderlich S. Berger M. Schwarzkopf M. Effertz K. Reutter W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3301-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which are specific for GlcNAc. Although mammalian GlcNAc kinases show no significant sequence similarity with hexokinases, they possess the two ATP-binding motifs (EGGGT and GTG) characteristic of the hexokinase family and are therefore classified into this family (38Cheek S. Zhang H. Grishin N.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 855-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Very recently, the crystal structures of human GlcNAc kinase in complex with GlcNAc and with glucose and ADP have been reported (39Weihofen W.A. Berger M. Chen H. Saenger W. Hinderlich S. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The structures reveal that human GlcNAc kinase has a similar core fold to the hexokinase family. StHK also contains the DAGGT and GTG motifs at the amino-terminal and middle regions of the sequence, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that StHK is a new member of the hexokinase family with unique substrate specificity.Here we report the crystal structures of StHK in four different forms as follows: (i) the apo-form; (ii) complex with glucose; (iii) complex with ADP; and (iv) complex with xylose, Mg2+, and ADP. These structures provide a molecular basis for the substrate specificity, conformational changes upon substrate binding, and catalytic mechanism of this enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSample Preparation and Crystallization—StHK was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity as described (35Nishimasu H. Fushinobu S. Shoun H. Wakagi T. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2014-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The selenomethionine-substituted protein was expressed in E. coli B834 (DE3). The cells were grown at 37 °C for 20 h in 1 liter of SeMet core medium (Wako) supplemented with 10 g of glucose, 0.25 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 4 mg of FeSO4·7H2O, 10 ml of vitamin growth supplement (Sigma), 0.1 g of ampicillin, and 25 mg of seleno-l-methionine (Wako). The protein was purified using the same protocol as for the native protein. The native and selenomethionine-substituted proteins were concentrated to 15 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and used for crystallization.Crystallization was performed at 25 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals of the apo-form were grown by mixing 2 μl of the protein solution and 1 μl of the reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 m HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5) and 1.3 m Li2SO4. Crystals of the ADP complex were grown by mixing 2 μl of the protein solution containing 5 mm ADP and 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 μl of the reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 m HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.7) and 1.3 m Li2SO4. Crystals of the glucose complex were grown by mixing 2 μl of the protein solution containing 10 mm glucose and 0.2 m MgCl2, and 1 μl of the reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.6) and 34% PEG3350. Crystals of the xylose·Mg2+·ADP complex were grown by mixing 2 μl of the protein solution containing 10 mm xylose, 20 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm ATP, and 1 μl of the reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and 18% PEG3350. The selenomethionine-substituted protein was crystallized under conditions similar to those used for the native crystals of the glucose complex. All crystals grew to full size within 1 week.Data Collection—X-ray diffraction data were collected using a charged-coupled device (CCD) camera at the BL-5 and BL-6A station at the Photon Factory, and the NW12 station at the Photon Factory AR, High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), Tsukuba, Japan. Crystals of the apo-form were cryoprotected in the reservoir solution supplemented with 20% trehalose. Crystals of the ADP complex were cryoprotected in the reservoir solution supplemented with 5 mm ADP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 20% trehalose. Crystals of the xylose·Mg2+·ADP complex were cryoprotected in the reservoir solution supplemented with 10 mm xylose, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, and 15% PEG400. All crystals were flash-frozen at 100 K in a stream of liquid nitrogen. Data were processed using the HKL2000 (40Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar).Structure Determination and Refinement—Initially, the structure of the glucose complex was determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction using a selenomethionine-substituted crystal. All eight selenium atoms were located, and initial phases were calculated using SOLVE/RESOLVE (41Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar), followed by automated model building using ARP/wARP (42Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). The resultant model was refined against the native data set of the glucose complex. Manual model building and refinement were performed using XtalView (43McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) and CNS (44Brunger A.T. Adams P.D.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar), respectively. The structure of the glucose complex was refined at 1.65 Åtoan R factor = 18.8 (Rfree = 21.8). The crystal belongs to space group C2221 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The final model contains residues 1–299, 1 glucose molecule, and 375 water molecules.The structure of the apo-form was determined at 1.9 Å resolution by molecular replacement using MOLREP (45Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4121) Google Scholar) in CCP4 (46Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar) with the small and large domains of the glucose complex structure as search models, and refined to an R factor = 17.5 (Rfree = 21.0). The crystal belongs to space group P21 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The final model contains molecules A (residues 1–298) and B (residues 1–297) as well as three sulfate ions, one HEPES molecule, and 573 water molecules. The two sulfate ions are bound at the dimer interface, whereas the other sulfate ion and the HEPES molecule are located far from the active site allowing them to participate in crystal packing interactions. As the two molecules are essentially identical (r.m.s.d. for C-α atoms = 0.44 Å), molecule A is described as the apo structure.The structure of the ADP complex was determined at 2.0 Å resolution by molecular replacement and refined to an R factor = 18.3 (Rfree = 22.6). The crystal belongs to space group P21 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The final model contains molecule A (residues 1–298) and B (residues 1–297) as well as two ADP molecules, three sulfate ions, one HEPES molecule, and 482 water molecules. As the two molecules are essentially identical (r.m.s.d. for C-α atoms = 0.38 Å), molecule A is described as the ADP complex structure.The structure of the xylose·Mg2+·ADP complex was determined at 2.0 Å resolution by molecular replacement and refined to an R factor = 21.3 (Rfree = 25.5). The crystal belongs to space group C2 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The final model contains molecule A (residues 1–297) and B (residues 1–296) in addition to one xylose molecule, one Mg2+ ion, two ADP molecules, and 261 water molecules. Two ADP molecules are included in the model, because no electron density was observed for the γ-phosphate of ATP, probably because of hydrolysis of ATP during crystallization, although the protein was crystallized in the presence of ATP. Molecule A adopts a closed conformation with bound xylose, Mg2+, and ADP, whereas molecule B adopts an open conformation with bound ADP and is essentially identical to the ADP complex structure (r.m.s.d. for C-α atoms = 0.66 Å).

The mutant enzyme was expressed and purified to homogeneity according to the same protocol as described for the wild-type enzyme. Enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 50 °C as described (35Nishimasu H. Fushinobu S. Shoun H. Wakagi T. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2014-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in a reaction mixture (500 μl) consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm glucose, 2 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm NADP+, 1 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 0.30 mg of the mutant enzyme.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONApo-form—The structure of StHK (299 amino acid residues) in the apo-form was determined at 1.9 Å resolution. The structure consists of two domains, each of which has the βββαβαβα fold characteristic of the ASKHA superfamily (Fig. 1A). The small domain (residues 1–107 and 274–299) is composed of a five-stranded mixed β-sheet (β3, β2, β1, β4, and β5), with strand β2 antiparallel to the rest, flanked on one side by a pair of α-helices (α2 and α3) and on the other by helix α11. The large domain (residues 108–273) is composed of a five-stranded mixed β-sheet (β8, β7, β6, β9, and β10), with strand β7 anti-parallel to the rest, six α-helices (α5 to α10), and a 310-helix. The β-sheet is flanked on one side by helix α4 and on the other side by a pair of α-helices (α9 and α10). The two domains are connected by helix α4. An intramolecular disulfide bond is formed by the conserved cysteine residues Cys-21 and Cys-291.A structural similarity search using Dali (48Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3552) Google Scholar) indicated that StHK shows relatively high degrees of similarity to the hexokinase family members, including E. coli glucokinase (26Lunin V.V.

StHK also shows modest structural similarity with other members of the ASKHA superfamily, such as E. coli glycerol kinase (49Hurley J.H. Faber H.R. Worthylake D. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Pettigrew D.W. Remington S.J. Science. 1993; 259: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1GLC; Z score = 13.6, and r.m.s.d. for 235 C-α atoms = 5.0 Å). The closest structural relative is the recently solved human GlcNAc kinase complexed with GlcNAc (39Weihofen W.A. Berger M. Chen H. Saenger W. Hinderlich S. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 2CH5; Z score = 28.1, and r.m.s.d. for 290 C-α atoms = 3.1 Å). The secondary structures are conserved within the two enzymes except that human GlcNAc kinase has an additional β-strand at the carboxyl terminus to form a six-stranded mixed β-sheet.StHK exists as a dimer in solution (35Nishimasu H. Fushinobu S. Shoun H. Wakagi T. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2014-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, the two molecules related by the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry form a dimer in the glucose complex structure, whereas two molecules in the asymmetric unit form a similar dimer in the other crystal forms (Fig. 1B). The two subunits are tightly connected by hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, salt bridges, and a disulfide bond. Two α-helices (α5 and α7) and two loop regions (β4-α3 and β8-α5) mainly contribute to dimerization. Trp-146, Arg-149, Lys-150, and Arg-153 on helix α5 form a hydrogen bonding network through water molecules with the counterparts of the adjacent subunit. Asp-141 on the β8-α5 loop forms salt bridges with Arg-153 and Lys-157 on helix α5 of the adjacent subunit. Cys-193 forms an intermolecular disulfide bond with the counterpart of the adjacent subunit. In the apo-form and the ADP complex, two sulfate ions derived from the crystallization buffer are bound at the dimer interface instead of water molecules to allow interactions with the protein.Glucose Complex—StHK was crystallized in the presence of glucose, and the glucose complex structure was determined at 1.65 Å resolution. Clear electron density for glucose is observed at the pocket formed by four loops, the β3-α1 and β4-α3 loops of the small domain and the β5-α4 and β8-α5 loops of the large domain (Fig. 2A). As observed in E. coli glucokinase (26Lunin V.V. Li Y. Schrag J.D. Iannuzzi P. Cygler M. Matte A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6915-6927Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), glucose is bound in the β-anomeric configuration. The hydroxyl groups of glucose form direct hydrogen bonds with Gly-69, Asp-71, His-94, Asp-95, Gly-135, and Asp-140 and water-mediated hydrogen bonds with Gly-11, Asn-35, and Gly-117. In addition, the 2-hydroxyl group is hydrogen-bonded with Tyr-189 of the adjacent subunit. The extensive hydrogen bonding interactions between the enzyme and glucose can explain the high affinity of the enzyme for glucose (Km = 0.050 mm) (35Nishimasu H. Fushinobu S. Shoun H. Wakagi T. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2014-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These residues involved in glucose binding are completely conserved in the homologs from Sulfolobus species (supplemental Fig. S1).FIGURE 2Stereo view of the active sites of the glucose complex (A), the ADP complex (B), and the xylose·Mg2+·ADP complex (C).

As a model we investigated TLR2 interactions with the GD1a ganglioside binding subunit of type IIb Escherichia coli enterotoxin (LT-IIb-B5). Both LT-IIb-B5 and a GD1a binding-defective mutant (LT-IIb-B5(T13I)) could modestly bind to TLR2, but only the wild-type molecule displayed a dramatic increase in TLR2 binding activity in the presence of GD1a (although not in the presence of irrelevant gangliosides). Moreover, fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments indicated that LT-IIb-B5 induces lipid raft recruitment of TLR2 and TLR1 and their clustering with GD1a, in contrast to the GD1a binding-defective mutant, which moreover fails to activate TLR2 signaling. LT-IIb-B5-induced cell activation was critically dependent upon the Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein, which was induced to colocalize with TLR2 and GD1a, as shown by confocal imaging. Therefore, GD1a provides TLR2 coreceptor function by enabling the ligand to recruit, bind, and activate TLR2. These findings establish a model of TLR2 coreceptor function and, moreover, suggest novel mechanisms of adjuvanticity by non-toxic derivatives of type II enterotoxins dependent upon GD1a/TLR2 cooperative activity.

Recent developments in the field of innate immunity support the concept that cellular activation by microbial molecules involves interactions with multiple cooperating host receptors within membrane lipid rafts, whereas single receptor-based interactions may often represent an oversimplified model (1Beutler B.

This concept is exemplified by the ability of pattern-recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) 2The abbreviations used are: TLR, toll-like receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; LT-IIb-B5, pentameric B subunit of type IIb E. coli enterotoxin; IL, interleukin; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotide; TIRAP, Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein; TIRAP-BP, TIRAP-blocking peptide; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PPMP, d,l-threo-l-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol·HCl; MCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; GD1a, Neu5Acα3Galβ3GalNAcβ4(Neu5Acα3)Galβ4Glc-ceramide; GD1b, Galβ3GalNAcβ4(Neu5Acα8Neu5Acα3)Galβ4Glc-ceramide; GM1, Galβ3GalNAcβ4(Neu5Acα3)Galβ4Glc-ceramide. or TLR2 to functionally associate with accessory molecules or coreceptors for induction of intracellular signaling. TLR4 alone is not sufficient for inducing a vigorous innate response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and requires MD-2 and CD14, although additional components of the LPS recognition complex may play a role in modifying TLR4-mediated signaling (4Triantafilou K. Triantafilou M. Dedrick R.L. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 5Latz E. Visintin A. Lien E. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Golenbock D.T.

TLR2 responds to microbial lipoproteins in association with TLR1 or TLR6 as signaling partners and with CD14 or CD36 as important coreceptors for robust activation of TLR2/1 or TLR2/6 complexes (1Beutler B.

Takeda K. Dong Z. Modlin R.L. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). The formation of TLR complexes with coreceptors may serve to generate a combinatorial repertoire for discriminating among the abundant and diverse microbial molecules and thereby to appropriately tailor the host response. However, the mechanisms involved in TLR cooperativity with accessory receptors are currently poorly understood. We have recently shown that the B subunit of type IIb heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (designated LT-IIb-B5) activates TLR2 signaling, although the underlying mechanism was not addressed (7Hajishengallis G. Tapping R.I. Martin M.H. Nawar H. Lyle E.A. Russell M.W. Connell T.D. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 1343-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Type IIb and related enterotoxins (types I and IIa) display an AB5 oligomeric structure in which a toxic A subunit is noncovalently linked to a pentameric ganglioside binding (B) subunit (8Holmes R. Jobling M.G. Connell T. Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughn M. Tu A.T. Bacterial Toxins and Virulence Factors in Disease: Handbook of Natural Toxins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 225-255Google Scholar). LT-IIb-B5 binds avidly to ganglioside GD1a (8Holmes R. Jobling M.G. Connell T. Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughn M. Tu A.T. Bacterial Toxins and Virulence Factors in Disease: Handbook of Natural Toxins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 225-255Google Scholar, 9Fukuta S. Magnani J.L. Twiddy E.M. Holmes R.K. Ginsburg V. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1748-1753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a GD1a nonbinding mutant (T13I) of LT-IIb-B5 fails to activate TLR2 (7Hajishengallis G. Tapping R.I. Martin M.H. Nawar H. Lyle E.A. Russell M.W. Connell T.D. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 1343-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These findings imply that GD1a may provide TLR2 coreceptor function for LT-IIb-B5-mediated cell activation. In this study we have tested the hypothesis that GD1a and TLR2 cooperate in molecular proximity as a heterotypic receptor complex that is essential for LT-IIb-B5-induced cellular activation. Mechanistically, GD1a may act by bringing LT-IIb-B5 within proximity of interaction with TLR2 in membrane lipid rafts. An alternative hypothesis, which could also account for the inability of the GD1a binding-defective point mutant (T13I) to activate TLR2, was that the threonine at position 13 is critical for direct interaction with TLR2, and therefore, GD1a binding by LT-IIb-B5 is irrelevant in terms of TLR2 activation. The results presented here are consistent with and strongly support the first hypothesis. Indeed, efficient cellular activation by LT-IIb-B5 required expression of both GD1a and TLR2 and their clustering into functional signaling complexes. Moreover, both LT-IIb-B5 and the point mutant bind modestly to TLR2, but only the wild-type molecule displays a dramatic increase in TLR2 binding activity in the presence of GD1a (although not in the presence of irrelevant gangliosides). Finally, LT-IIb-B5-induced cellular activation was critically dependent upon lipid raft function and on the Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), which was induced to colocalize with TLR2 and GD1a. The presented findings establish a model of TLR coreceptor function according to which the coreceptor enables the ligand to recruit, bind, and activate TLR2 signaling in lipid rafts. Recombinant wild-type or mutant (T13I) LT-IIb-B5 were expressed in E. coli DH5αF′Kan (Invitrogen) transformed with the appropriate plasmids, and the proteins were extracted from the periplasmic space using polymyxin B treatment (7Hajishengallis G.

The proteins were purified by means of ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by nickel affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl-100 column and anÁKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare). Identity and purity were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis immunoblotting using specific rabbit IgG antibodies and by quantitative Limulus amebocyte lysate assay kits (BioWhittaker, Walkers-ville, MD and Charles River Endosafe, Charleston, SC), which determined negligible endotoxic activity (≤0.0064 ng/μg of protein). Further evidence against contamination with LPS or other heat-stable contaminants was obtained upon LT-IIb-B5 boiling, which destroys their biological activities (Refs. 7Hajishengallis G.

Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD), cholesterol, cytochalasin D, and brefeldin A were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The reagents were used at effective concentrations determined in preliminary experiments or in previous publications. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells (ATCC CRL-9618) were maintained in Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) and COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Monocytes were purified from human peripheral blood upon centrifugation over NycoPrep™1.068 (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway) as previously described (11Harokopakis E. Albzreh M.H. Martin M.H.

Incidental non-monocytes were removed by magnetic depletion using a mixture of biotin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and magnetic microbeads coupled to anti-biotin mAb (Monocyte isolation kit II; Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Purified monocytes were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (complete RPMI). Complete RPMI was also used to culture human monocytic THP-1 cells (ATCC TIB 202). Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages were isolated from the peritoneal cavity of mice deficient in CD14 or TLR2 or from wild-type C57BL/6 control mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine) as previously described (7Hajishengallis G.

Mouse macrophages were cultured in complete RPMI, except for the use of autologous mouse serum rather than fetal bovine serum. Cell viability was monitored using the CellTiter-Blue™ assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). None of the experimental treatments affected cell viability compared with medium-only control treatments. Human blood collections and isolation of mouse macrophages were conducted in compliance with established federal guide-lines and institutional policies. Ganglioside-loaded and TLR-transfected CHO-K1 Cells—Reporter assays for NF-κB activation based on inducible luciferase activity were performed as previously described (3Hajishengallis G. Tapping R.I.

Briefly, CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding human TLR2 (pUNO-hTLR2), a mutant version of TLR2 devoid of the intracellular TIR domain (pZERO-hTLR2tirless), TLR4/MD2 (pDUO-hMD2/TLR4), or empty control vectors (InvivoGen; San Diego, CA). To monitor cellular activation, the cells were cotransfected with a firefly luciferase reporter gene controlled by five tandem repeats of NF-κB consensus sequence cloned upstream of a basic promoter (pNF-κB-Luc; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), along with a Renilla luciferase transfection control (pRL-null; Promega). Transfections were performed using the PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Four hours post-transfection, the cells were incubated with or without GD1a or GD1b (20 μm) in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 24 h. CHO-K1 cells do not synthesize complex gangliosides (13Rosales Fritz V.M. Daniotti J.L. Maccioni H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the rationale for this treatment was to assess the effect of ganglioside loading on activation of TLR2-transfected CHO-K1 cells by LT-IIb-B5. At the end of the 24-h incubation, the cells were washed with serum-free medium and stimulated with LT-IIb-B5 at 37 °C for 6 h. The Renilla and firefly luciferase activities were subsequently measured in cell lysates using the Dual-Glo™ luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a Clarity™ luminescence microplate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT). Luciferase activity was calculated as a ratio of firefly luciferase activity to Renilla luciferase activity to correct for transfection efficiency. The results were then normalized to those of unstimulated control cells transfected with reporter and empty vectors, the value of which was taken as 1. HEK-293 and THP-1 Cells—Similar procedures (except that no ganglioside loading was performed) were followed to determine activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription in ganglioside-expressing HEK-293 cells cotransfected with human TLR1/TLR2 (pDUO-hTLR1/TLR2; InvivoGen) and the NF-κB reporter system described above using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). NF-κB-dependent transcription in THP-1 cells was assessed as above except that the cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing dominant negative inhibitors of human TLR2 (pZERO-hTLR2tirless; Invivo-Gen), TIRAP (pDeNy-hTIRAP; InvivoGen), TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing IFN-B-related adaptor molecule (TRAM; pDeNy-hTRAM), or empty vector controls. Human monocytes or mouse macrophages (2 × 105/well) were stimulated with LT-IIb-B5 for 16 h at 37 °C. Induction of release of IL-6 in culture supernatants was measured by human- or mouse-specific IL-6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). To determine the role of TIRAP in LT-IIb-B5-induced cytokine induction, we used a cell-permeable peptide set, including a peptide that inhibits TIRAP binding to human TLR2 or TLR4 and an inactive control peptide (14Schilling D. Thomas K. Nixdorff K. Vogel S.N. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5874-5880Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Imgenex; San Diego, CA). For inhibiting mouse TIRAP, we used an analogous cell-permeable TIRAP inhibitory and control peptide set (15Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 16Horng T. Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) (Calbio-chem). The TLR9 agonist, CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), was used as a TIRAP-independent control. For this purpose, CpG ODN M362 (human-specific) and GpG ODN 1826 (murine-specific) were obtained from InvivoGen. To deplete cellular gangliosides we used the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor PPMP (17Galvan E.M. Diema C.D. Roth G.A. Monferran C.G. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 1556-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For this purpose human monocytes were incubated at 37 °C for 3 days with or without 5 μm PPMP. Inhibition of surface expression of ganglioside GD1a was confirmed by reduced reactivity with anti-GD1a mAb or with LT-IIb-B5 ligand (see “Results”). Untreated and PPMP-treated cells were further incubated (37 °C, 24 h) without or with 20 μm gangliosides (GD1a, GD1b, or GM1) in the absence or presence of 5 μm PPMP. Cells were then washed with culture medium and stimulated (37 °C, 16 h) with the indicated concentrations of LT-IIb-B5 without or with 5 μm PPMP. Culture supernatants were collected for determining IL-6 induction as described above. Biotinylated LT-IIb-B5 (1 μg/ml) was allowed to bind to TLR-transfected and/or ganglioside-loaded CHO-K1 cells or primary human monocytes for 15 min at 37 °C, as we have previously described for other bacterial molecules (12Hajishengallis G. Ratti P. Harokopakis E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38902-38913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Harokopakis E. Hajishengallis G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the cells were washed and incubated on ice with FITC-labeled streptavidin. After washing, binding was determined by measuring cell-associated fluorescence (in relative fluorescence units) on a microplate fluorescence reader (Bio-Tek) with excitation/emission wavelength settings of 485/530 nm. Background fluorescence was determined in cells treated with medium only and FITC-streptavidin. TLR2 binding was measured using a modification of a previously published method (19Massari P. Visintin A. Gunawardana J. Halmen K.A. King C.A. Golenbock D.T. Wetzler L.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 2373-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter wells were coated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μg/ml purified recombinant mouse TLR2 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN). After blocking with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C, biotinylated wild-type or mutant LT-IIb-B5 (2 μg/ml in PBS/1% BSA) were allowed to bind to immobilized TLR2 in the absence or presence of gangliosides (10 μm) for 2 h at 37°C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, bound protein was detected with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. The peroxidase reaction was performed using tetramethylbenzidene chromogenic substrate, and the optical density signal at 450 nm was read in a microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). Because recombinant TLR2 is expressed as a fusion protein with the Fc region of human IgG (R&D systems), the complete lack of LT-IIb-B5 binding to recombinant CD14 (supplemental Fig. 1B), which is similarly fused to the Fc region of human IgG, has excluded the possibility of LT-IIb-B5 binding to the Fc region. To deplete human monocytes of cholesterol using MCD and reconstituting cellular cholesterol in MCD-treated cells we used a modification of previously published methodology (20Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lawrence J.C. Saslowsky D.E. Edwardson J.M. Henderson R.M. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1827-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, human monocytes or HEK-293 cells were incubated in the presence of 10 mm MCD for 30 min at 37 °C to deplete the cells of cholesterol. The cells were washed and incubated for an additional 30 min with medium only or with 150 μm cholesterol. Subsequently, the cells (MCD-treated, MCD-treated plus cholesterol-reconstituted, and cells treated with medium only) were incubated with LT-IIb-B5 for cellular activation assays. The procedures for measuring the efficiency of energy transfer between fluorescently labeled cell surface receptors have been previously described in detail (3Hajishengallis G. Tapping R.I. Harokopakis E. Nishiyama S.-I. Ratti P. Schifferle R.E. Lyle E.A. Triantafilou M. Triantafilou K. Yoshimura F. Cell.

J. 2004; 381: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, human monocytes were cultured on microchamber culture slides (Lab-tek, Invitrogen). After treatment for 10 min at 37 °C with medium only or with LT-IIb-B5 (1 μg/ml), the cells were labeled with 100 μl of a mixture of Cy3-conjugated mAb (donor) and Cy5-conjugated mAb (acceptor). The cells were rinsed twice with PBS containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cell fixation was necessary to prevent potential reorganization of the proteins during the course of the experiment and energy transfer determinations. Energy transfer between different receptor pairs was calculated from the increase in donor fluorescence after acceptor photobleaching. The following mAbs (clones) were used for FRET: anti-TLR1 (GD2.F4), anti-TLR2 (TL2.1), and anti-TLR4 (HTA-125) were from HyCult (Uden, The Netherlands); anti-GD1a (GD1a-2b) and anti-GD1b (GD1b-1) were from AMS Biotechnology (Oxford, UK); anti-CD14 (Tük 4) and anti-MHC class I (W6/32) were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Anti-CD14 mAb, clone 26ic, was purified from hybridoma supernatant (ATCC HB246; Manassas, VA). Cholera toxin was from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA) and was used to label GM1. The conjugation of antibodies or other molecules to Cy3 or Cy5 was performed using kits from Amersham Biosciences. COS-7 cells were grown on chamber slides (Lab-Tek) and transfected with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged TLR2 and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-tagged TIRAP using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). Two days after transfection, cells were stimulated with LT-IIb-B5 for 5 min. Immediately afterward the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100. Cells were then stained with rabbit IgG anti-LT-IIb-B5 and Alexa568-anti-rabbit IgG and mounted with coverslips before imaging on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Data were evaluated by analysis of variance and the Dunnett multiple-comparison test using the InStat program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Where appropriate (comparison of two groups only), two-tailed t tests were also performed. Statistical differences were considered significant at the level of p < 0.05. Experiments were performed using triplicate samples and were performed twice or more to verify the results. GD1a and TLR2 Cooperate for Cell Activation and Binding of LT-IIb-B5—We investigated the hypothesis that GD1a binding is a necessary condition for efficient TLR2 activation by LT-IIb-B5. For this purpose we used CHO-K1 cells, which do not synthesize GD1a or other complex gangliosides (13Rosales Fritz V.M. Daniotti J.L. Maccioni H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells, moreover, lack functional endogenous TLR2 but transcribe TLR1 and TLR6, either of which is capable of cooperative signaling with TLR2 in TLR2-transfected CHO-K1 cells (23Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar, 24Henneke P. Takeuchi O. van Strijp J.A. Guttormsen H.K. Smith J.A. Schromm A.B. Espevik T.A. Akira S. Nizet V. Kasper D.L. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We have, therefore, transfected CHO-K1 cells with human TLR2 to allow reconstitution of TLR2/TLR1 cooperative signaling, required for maximal cell activation by LT-IIb-B5 (7Hajishengallis G. Tapping R.I. Martin M.H. Nawar H. Lyle E.A. Russell M.W. Connell T.D. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 1343-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, transfection with TLR2 led to relatively poor LT-IIb-B5-induced activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription, unless the cells were supplemented with GD1a (Fig. 1A). Indeed, TLR2-transfected and GD1a-supplemented cells exhibited a >4-fold higher NF-κB activation in response to LT-IIb-B5 than similarly transfected cells in the absence of GD1a or in the presence of a control ganglioside (GD1b) (p < 0.05; Fig. 1A). On the other hand, GD1a-supplemented cells transfected with empty vector or TLR4/MD2 (Fig. 1A) or with a signaling-deficient mutant of TLR2 (devoid of the intracellular TIR domain; TLR2-ΔTIR) (Fig. 1B) failed to activate NF-κBin response to LT-IIb-B5. As expected, the control TLR2/TLR1 agonist Pam3Cys activated TLR2-transfected CHO-K1 cells regardless of the presence or absence of gangliosides (Fig. 1A) but did not activate TLR2-ΔTIR-transfected cells (Fig. 1B). The GD1a binding-defective mutant LT-IIb-B5(T13I) (Fig. 1A)as well as boiled LT-IIb-B5 (not shown) failed to activate the cells even when they were supplemented with GD1a and transfected with TLR2. These data clearly indicate that effective NF-κB activation by LT-IIb-B5 specifically requires the presence of both GD1a and TLR2. We next examined the binding of LT-IIb-B5 to CHO-K1 cells upon ganglioside loading and/or TLR transfection. The binding of LT-IIb-B5 was significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced upon cell loading with its ganglioside receptor, GD1a, but not with GD1b (Fig. 1C). This finding confirmed the ganglioside specificity of LT-IIb-B5 and that exogenous addition of GD1a is incorporated in the cell membrane. Interestingly, in the absence of GD1a LT-IIb-B5 displayed modest binding to TLR2-transfected cells relative to empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1C). The binding of LT-IIb-B5 (used in biotinylated form for probing with streptavidin-FITC) to GD1a-loaded and TLR2-transfected cells was competitively inhibited by excess unlabeled LT-IIb-B5 (not shown). Most importantly, the ability of LT-IIb-B5 to bind plate-immobilized TLR2 was significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced in the presence of GD1a but not in the presence of GD1b or GM1 (Fig. 1D). In the absence of GD1a, LT-IIb-B5(T13I) displayed low binding to TLR2, similar to that seen with the wild-type molecule; however, the TLR2 binding activity of LT-IIb-B5(T13I) was not enhanced in the presence of GD1a (Fig. 1D). As expected, control incubation of TLR2 with GD1a alone (i.e. without biotinylated LT-IIb-B5) followed by streptavidin-peroxidase labeling resulted in no signal (Fig. 1D). GD1a (probed with anti-GD1a mAb) displayed negligible binding to TLR2 (not shown). The findings from Fig. 1 collectively indicate that GD1a binding is required for the ability of LT-IIb-B5 to effectively interact with and activate TLR2. Effect of Native Ganglioside Depletion on LT-IIb-B5-induced Monocyte Activation—To determine the role of native gangliosides on LT-IIb-B5-induced activation of a physiologically more relevant cell type, we treated primary human monocytes with a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor (PPMP) to deplete cellular gangliosides. We first confirmed that PPMP treatment resulted in reduction of GD1a expression by observing significantly (p < 0.05) reduced binding of LT-IIb-B5 or anti-GD1a mAb to treated monocytes compared with untreated controls (Fig. 2A). However, exogenous addition of GD1a, but not of GD1b or GM1, reconstituted the cell binding activity of LT-IIb-B5 or anti-GD1a (Fig. 2A). In the absence of PPMP treatment, LT-IIb-B5 induced production of IL-6 in a dose-dependent way (Fig. 2B). However, PPMP treatment r"
https://openalex.org/W1996415348,"The halotolerant alga Dunaliella salina is unique among plants in that it utilizes a transferrin (TTf) to mediate iron acquisition (Fisher, M., Zamir, A., and Pick, U. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 17553–17558). Two new proteins that are induced by iron deprivation were identified in plasma membranes of D. salina as follows: a multicopper ferroxidase termed D-Fox and an internally duplicated glycoprotein (p130B). D-Fox and p130B are accessible to glycolytic, proteolytic, and biotin surface tagging treatments, suggesting that they are surface-exposed glycoproteins. Induction of D-Fox was also manifested by ferroxidase activity in plasma membrane preparations. These results are puzzling because ferroxidases in yeast and in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii function in redox-mediated iron uptake, a mechanism that is not known to operate in D. salina. Two lines of evidence suggest that D-Fox and p130B interact with D. salina triplicated transferrin (TTf). First, chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectroscopy analysis showed that D-Fox and p130B associate with TTf and with another plasma membrane transferrin. Second, detergent-solubilized D-Fox and p130B comigrated on blue native gels with plasma membrane transferrins. 59Fe autoradiography indicated that this complex binds Fe3+ ions. Also, the induction of D-Fox and p130B is kinetically correlated with enhanced iron binding and uptake activities. These results suggest that D-Fox and p130B associate with plasma membrane transferrins forming a complex that enhances iron binding and iron uptake. We propose that the function of D-Fox in D. salina has been modified during evolution from redox-mediated to transferrin-mediated iron uptake, following a gene transfer event of transferrins from an ancestral animal cell.

Iron is an essential element for all photosynthetic organisms because it is a cofactor of multiple components in photosynthetic electron transport. Iron deficiency is a common limitation for plant and algae proliferation because of its low availability in aerobic aqueous solutions. On the other hand, an excess of iron is highly toxic because it can elicit the formation of reactive oxygen species causing oxidative damage. Therefore, all photosynthetic organisms had to develop efficient regulatory mechanisms to control the uptake and storage of iron in order to maintain optimal iron metabolism.Two major strategies of high affinity iron uptake have been demonstrated in plants and in algae as follows: siderophore-mediated Fe3+ uptake and a redox-mediated mechanism. The siderophore-mediated Fe3+ uptake was first described in bacteria and is characteristic to several algae (1Benderliev K.M. Ivanova N.I. Planta. 1994; 193: 163-166Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 2Boye M. van den Berg C.M.G. Mar. Chem. 2000; 70: 277-287Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and to grasses (strategy II plants). Redox-mediated iron acquisition, initiated by reduction of ferric to ferrous ions by a plasma membrane ferrireductase, is characteristic to strategy I plants, yeast, and algae (3Allnutt F.C.T.

The mechanism of redox-mediated iron uptake in plants differs from that in yeast and in the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in that plants transport the reduced ferrous ions directly via a divalent metal transporter, whereas in yeast and in C. reinhardtii ferrous ions are reoxidized to ferric ions. Reoxidation is mediated by a membranal multicopper ferroxidase, Fet3 or Fox1, belonging to the multicopper oxidase (MCO) 2The abbreviations used are: MCO, multicopper oxidase; D-Fox, D. salina ferroxidase; Fox1, C. reinhardtii ferroxidase; TTf, D. salina triplicated transferrin; DTf, D. salina transferrin; PNGase, peptide N-glycosidase; BN, blue native gels; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; IEF, isoelectric focusing; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; TTM, tetrathiomolybdate; DST, disuccinimidyl tartrate; EGS, succinimidylsuccinate; Bis-tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; UTR, untranslated region; MS, mass spectrometry.2The abbreviations used are: MCO, multicopper oxidase; D-Fox, D. salina ferroxidase; Fox1, C. reinhardtii ferroxidase; TTf, D. salina triplicated transferrin; DTf, D. salina transferrin; PNGase, peptide N-glycosidase; BN, blue native gels; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; IEF, isoelectric focusing; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; TTM, tetrathiomolybdate; DST, disuccinimidyl tartrate; EGS, succinimidylsuccinate; Bis-tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; UTR, untranslated region; MS, mass spectrometry. superfamily (7Herbik A.

The MCO Fox1 and the iron permease Ftr1 are believed to form a complex at the plasma membrane as demonstrated in yeast (9Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A.

Both siderophore and redox-mediated iron uptake are up-regulated under iron deprivation, thus compensating for the decreased iron availability by a more efficient high affinity iron uptake.The halotolerant alga Dunaliella salina is well adapted to iron deprivation, as manifested by its proliferation and by maintenance of photosynthetic activity under iron deprivation (11Varsano T. Kaftan D. Pick U. J. Plant Nutr. 2003; 26: 2197-2210Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We found that D. salina has an unusual mechanism of iron uptake, mediated by binding and internalization of Fe3+ to a surface transferrin-like protein, TTf (12Fisher M. Gokhman I. Pick U. Zamir A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1565-1570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13Fisher M. Zamir A. Pick U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17553-17558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). TTf serves as a housekeeping mechanism for iron uptake, but its expression level and activity are enhanced under iron deprivation or at high salinity, which limits iron availability. The origin of transferrins in Dunaliella is not clear, because no other transferrins have been described so far in other plants or in related organisms. More recently we identified another transferrin, DTf, that is induced under iron deprivation in D. salina plasma membrane. The function of DTf has not been elucidated yet (14Schwarz M. Sal-Man N. Zamir A. Pick U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1649: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Because TTf is an iron-binding protein that is loosely associated with the outer plasma membrane surface (15Schwarz M. Zamir A. Pick U. J. Plant Nutr. 2003; 26: 2081-2091Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), it may be expected that iron uptake in D. salina requires additional plasma membrane proteins. In an attempt to identify such proteins, we compared the protein composition of plasma membranes derived from iron-deficient and from iron-sufficient D. salina cells. The comparison revealed two major induced proteins of about 130 kDa in the plasma membrane of iron-deficient cells. Based on their cDNA-deduced sequence, one of the proteins was identified as a member of the MCO family, and hence termed Dunaliella ferroxidase (D-Fox), whereas the other protein (p130B) showed no sequence homology to any known protein. Unexpectedly, we found that D-Fox is not involved in redox-mediated iron uptake, like MCO in yeast or in C. reinhardtii, but it is associated with transferrins in D. salina plasma membranes and functions in enhancing iron binding. Thus, enhancement of iron binding appears to be a critical parameter for iron acquisition in D. salina.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAlgal Strain and Growth Conditions—D. salina was obtained from Dr. W. H. Thomas, La Jolla, CA. All culture glassware was washed in acid and thoroughly rinsed with Milli-Q water. Cells were cultured in iron-sufficient or in iron-deficient media as described previously (12Fisher M. Gokhman I. Pick U. Zamir A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1565-1570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13Fisher M. Zamir A. Pick U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17553-17558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Standard growth medium contained 1 m NaCl, with or without 1.5 μm FeCl3, 6 μm EDTA, unless otherwise indicated.Plasma Membrane Preparation—Plasma membranes were prepared by differential centrifugation as described earlier (14Schwarz M. Sal-Man N. Zamir A. Pick U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1649: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed in glycerol medium and osmotically lysed; chloroplasts were then removed by sedimentation at 650 × g for 10 min, and plasma membranes were sedimented at 12,000 × g for 60 min, washed, and stored in liquid nitrogen.Cloning of D-Fox and p130B—Total RNA was prepared from 5 × 107 cells harvested 20 h after transfer to iron-deficient medium with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Synthesis of cDNA using 1 μg of RNA was carried out with the superscript reverse transcriptase (Clontech). The cDNA was used as template in PCR performed with degenerate primers designed from peptide sequences obtained from MS analysis (D-Fox 5′-sense, GTNCCNGARRGAYGCNGC; D-Fox 5′-antisense, GTNGCNGTRTTNCCNCC; p130B 5′-sense, AYACNGAYGARCARTTYTGG; and p130B 5′-antisense, TCYTGCATRTTNGTNCCCC). The 600-bp PCR product was subcloned into pTZ57R vector using the InsT/Aclone™ cloning kit (Fermentas UAB, Vilnius, Lithuania). Specific primers (D-Fox 5′-sense, CTGTATCCATGCATCCCC; D-Fox 5′-antisense, GTAGGTCTTGATCGCCTGC; p130B 5′-sense, CTCAGCACTAACAATTGGGGG; and p130B 5′-antisense, CAAGCTTGCCAGTGTCTGCC) were used in 3′- and 5′-RACE reactions to clone the full-length cDNA using the Smart™ RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech).Polyclonal Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies were prepared in rabbits against synthetic peptides derived from the amino acid sequences of D-Fox and p130B (C-TFTEEVERPQEDAY and PADGNKEELYRNEDL-C, respectively). The peptides, containing an extra terminal cysteine, were coupled to a carrier protein, maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce), and were injected into rabbits. On Western blot analysis with protein extracts from intact cells or plasma membrane, both antibodies reacted with a single band of about 130 kDa.Trypsin Digestion—Iron-deficient cells (2 × 107 cells/ml) were suspended in iso-osmotic suspension buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1.4 m glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2) and were then incubated with 3 mg/ml trypsin (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated) for 30 min at room temperature. The digestion was terminated by addition of 12 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor. An aliquot of 2 × 106 cells was analyzed on SDS-PAGE.Deglycosylation with PNGase F—Plasma membrane preparations from iron-deficient D. salina cells were denatured in glycoprotein denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) at 100 °C. Next, the deglycosylation reaction was carried out in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40. After addition of 1 unit of N-glycosidase PNGase F, the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The digestion was arrested by addition of loading sample buffer. Samples containing 20 μg of protein were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, or analyzed by immunoblotting.Biotin Labeling of Surface Proteins—The biotinylation procedure was performed essentially according to Ref. 14Schwarz M. Sal-Man N. Zamir A. Pick U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1649: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar. In brief, cell samples were washed and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce). Cells were lysed, and plasma membranes were prepared as described above. After protein separation by SDS-PAGE and electroblotting, biotinylated proteins were identified with streptavidin.Chemical Cross-linking—Plasma membrane preparations from iron-deficient D. salina cells were suspended in 1.4 m glycerol, 20 mm Na-HEPES, 10 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2. Disuccinimide tartrate (DST) in Me2SO was added to a final concentration of 5 mm followed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated with 50 mm unbuffered Tris and incubated for another 10 min on ice.Protein Analysis by Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Separation and analysis of proteins on 7.5% SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (16Fisher M. Pick U. Zamir A. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1359-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Analysis of plasma membrane proteins by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing (IEF)/SDS-PAGE was as follows. Plasma membrane protein samples (350 μg of protein) were incubated in standard IEF buffer containing 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 0.5% IPG buffer (GE Healthcare), and 20 mm DTT for 1 h at room temperature, loaded onto an 18-cm IPG dry strip, pH 3.0–5.6 (GE Healthcare), by active rehydration (for 12 h), and subjected to IEF for 65,000 V-h using IPG-phor instrument (GE Healthcare). Focused gel strips were equilibrated in SDS equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 6 m urea), first in 1% DTT (w/v) and next in 4% iodoacetamide. Strips were washed briefly with running buffer and loaded onto 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride paper for reaction with antibodies. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis of excised protein spots was performed by the MS service unit at The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.Two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE—Membrane samples (75 μg of protein) were solubilized in 30 μl of buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Bis-tris, pH 7.0, 0.5 m ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and plant protease inhibitor mixture. After 20 min at 4 °C, unsolubilized material was precipitated, and the solubilized proteins were mixed with BN sample buffer (final: 0.1 m 5-aminocaproic acid, 0.5% Coomassie Blue G-250). The samples were resolved on 4.5–13% gradient BN gel at 4 °C for 4 h. For resolution on a second dimension, lanes were cut out and equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 2% SDS, and 30% glycerol, supplemented consecutively with 1% DTT or with 2% iodoacetamide and resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above.Ferroxidase Activity—Ferroxidase activity was determined by following the oxidation of ferrous ions using ferrozine as a specific chelator of ferrous ions (17Gibbs C.R. Anal. Chem. 1976; 48: 1197-1201Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Cells were washed once and suspended in a buffer containing 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2. Ferrous sulfate was dissolved in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, under N2 gas (to avoid ferrous spontaneous oxidation), prior to use. The reaction was initiated by adding ferrous sulfate to a final concentration of 50 μm at a cell density of 107 cells/ml. Incubation was under continuous shaking in the dark to avoid generation of O2 in the oxidation assay. Reactions were terminated by addition of ferrozine to a final concentration of 600 μm, followed by sedimentation, and the rate of ferrous oxidation was calculated from the decreased absorbance at 562 nm (ϵ562 of 27,900 mol liter–1 cm–1).Iron Binding and Uptake—Iron binding and uptake assays were performed as described previously (13Fisher M. Zamir A. Pick U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17553-17558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 107 cells/ml) were suspended in growth medium buffer without iron, containing 50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 8.0, and 5 mm NaHCO3. The binding/uptake assays were initiated by addition of 59Fe citrate and incubated for 30 min in the dark at 4 °C (iron binding) or for 1 h in the light under continuous shaking at 24 °C (iron uptake). Incubations were terminated by a 5-fold dilution into ice-cold stop solutions, containing 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Na-MES, pH 5.3, without (iron binding) or with (iron uptake) 5 mm Na-EDTA. The cells were washed twice in the same solutions and counted in a β-counter.RESULTSIdentification and Cloning of Iron Deficiency-induced Proteins—A comparison of plasma membranes polypeptide composition was carried out between iron-deficient and iron-sufficient D. salina cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, three major proteins accumulate under iron deprivation as follows: two transferrin-like proteins, TTf and DTf (idi-100), which were previously cloned and characterized (13Fisher M. Zamir A. Pick U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17553-17558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Schwarz M. Zamir A. Pick U. J. Plant Nutr. 2003; 26: 2081-2091Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and a broad protein band of about 130 kDa, which was absent from plasma membranes derived from iron-sufficient cells. Separation of plasma membrane proteins from iron-deficient cells on two-dimensional IEF/SDS-polyacrylamide gels, resolved the 130-kDa band into two distinct proteins of similar apparent molecular weight that were termed p130A and p130B (Fig. 1B). Treatment of plasma membranes from iron-deficient cells with a peptidyl N-glycosidase, also resolved the 130-kDa bands into two distinct components on one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gels (see Fig. 4C). Both protein bands from the two different gels were excised, cleaved with trypsin, and analyzed by nanoelectrospray MS/MS. A partial sequence of about 30 peptides was obtained. A search in protein data bases revealed that 14 of these sequences show homology to MCO. Based on these sequences, forward and reverse degenerate nucleotide primers were designed and utilized in different combinations for PCR amplification on cDNA from iron-deficient cells. A PCR product of 600 bp was initially cloned, and the sequencing was completed by 3′-RACE and 5′-RACE PCR extensions. A DNA product of 4275 bp was obtained, containing an open reading frame of 3225 bp, encoding a deduced polypeptide of 1075 amino acids, flanked by 45 bp at the 5′-UTR and by 1003 bp at the 3′-UTR. A polyadenylation signal (TGTAA), located 14 bp upstream from the poly(A) tail, was identified. All 14 amino acid sequences obtained by the MS analysis, covering about 12% of the total protein, were identified within the deduced amino acid sequence (data no shown). The highest sequence similarity (40% identity and 57% similarity) was obtained by FOX1, an iron-deficiency induced protein from the green alga C. reinhardtii (Fig. 2; compare with Fig. 3 in Ref. 8La Fontaine S. Quinn J.M. Nakamoto S.S. Page M.D. Gohre V. Mosely J.L. Kropat J. Merchant S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 736-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The protein was therefore termed D-Fox (Dunaliella ferroxidase; GenBank™ accession number AY987035).FIGURE 4Enzymatic digestion and biotin tagging of surface proteins in iron-deficient D. salina cells. A, trypsin treatment. Samples of 2 × 107 iron-deficient D. salina cells were incubated with or without 3 mg/ml trypsin. Digestion was terminated by addition of 12 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor.

Alignment of the amino acid sequence of D-Fox with C. reinhardtii Fox1 (GenBank™ accession AF450137) was made by ClustalW (EBI). Identical and conserved amino acid residues are shaded in black and gray, respectively. Putative copper-binding motifs type I, type II, and type III are boxed in thin or boldface frames or dot-underlined, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sequence Analysis of D-Fox—By comparing amino acid sequences of D-Fox to Fox1, we found 20% higher abundance of acidic residues, a characteristic feature of proteins in halophiles, which was also found previously in extracellular proteins of Dunaliella (18Premkumar L. Greenblatt H.M. Bageshwar U.K. Savchenko T. Gokhman I. Sussman J.L. Zamir A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7493-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of D-Fox revealed that it consists of three internal homologous repeats with 28–31% sequence identity (amino acids 61–350, 400–715, and 764-end), a typical feature in the MCO family, probably resulting from a gene duplication event. Moreover, we identified several putative copper-binding sites, which are conserved in the MCO protein family and in particularly in C. reinhardtii Fox1. The copper-binding sites included three type I motifs, between amino acids 331–351, 694–714, 1049–1070, and one type II copper-binding motif, between amino acids 336 and 347. In addition, several His-X-His copper-binding motifs were found, as reported also in C. reinhardtii Fox1 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, type I copper-binding motifs were perfectly aligned in all three domains within the internal triplication. A hydropathy plot of D-Fox revealed a large hydrophilic protein with only one clear hydrophobic stretch at the N-terminal end. Sequence analysis predicted a signal peptide in the N-terminal hydrophobic stretch, which is most likely cleaved between amino acids 25 and 26. Three potential N-glycosylation sites were identified at amino acid residues 382, 814, and 934.Cloning and Sequence Analysis of p130B—To identify p130B, degenerate nucleotide primers were designed corresponding to the amino acid sequences of peptides that did not correspond to D-Fox, and we utilized them in different combinations for PCR amplification on cDNA from iron-deficient cells. This resulted in cloning of a second DNA product of 3948 bp, containing an open reading frame of 3163 bp, encoding a deduced polypeptide of 1054 amino acids, flanked by 93 bp at the 5′-UTR and by 692 bp at the 3′-UTR (Fig. 3A). All 17 amino acid sequences obtained from the MS analysis, covering about 10% of the total protein, were identified within the deduced amino acid sequences as shown in Fig. 3A. The sequence of p130B (GenBank™ accession number AY987036) showed no significant homology to any known protein in the data bases. It should be noted that the sequence of p130B revealed an internal duplication with 38% sequence identity and 59% similarity. Hydropathy plot demonstrated two putative membrane-spanning helices, one at the N-terminal end and another at the C-terminal end of the protein (Fig. 3B). The N-terminal helix was predicted to be a leader peptide helix, which is most likely cleaved between residues 23 and 24 (computed by the CBS prediction server). Motifs for C-terminal protein prenylation (19Maurer-Stroh S. Eisenhaber F. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or post-translational glycosylphosphatidylinositol lipid-anchoring predictions (20Eisenhaber B. Wildpaner M. Schultz C.J. Borner G.H.H. Dupree P. Eisenhaber F. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 1691-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) were not detected. However, sequence analysis prediction revealed three putative N-glycosylation sites in amino acid residues 86, 361, and 495 (NetNGlyc).FIGURE 3Nucleotides, deduced amino acid sequence, and hydropathy plot of the D. salina p130B.

Two approaches were selected to test the orientation of D-Fox and p130B as follows: exposure to proteolysis and biotin surface tagging. As demonstrated in Fig. 4A, exposure of intact cells to trypsin treatment resulted in digestion of TTf, p130B, D-Fox, and DTf, as shown by the disappearance of the corresponding protein bands and by Western analysis. Labeling intact cells with a membrane-impermeable biotin tag, followed by detection with streptavidin, revealed a selective labeling of four major components corresponding to TTf, p130B, D-Fox, and DTf (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that p130B and D-Fox, similar to TTf and DTf (14Schwarz M. Sal-Man N. Zamir A. Pick U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1649: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), are also exposed to the extracellular side of the plasma membrane of D. salina. Treatment of plasma membrane preparations from iron-deficient cells with PNGase F increased the electrophoretic mobility of D-Fox and of p130B and resolved them into two distinct bands on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that D-Fox and p130B are N-glycosylated proteins, consistent with their putative N-glycosylation sites. We also found that both proteins, as well as TTf, are stained with the glycoprotein stain DIG-Glycan detection kit (Roche Applied Science), (not shown). Together, these results clearly indicate that D-Fox and p130B are N-glycosylated proteins located at the outer surface of the plasma membrane.D-Fox Is a Plasma Membrane Ferroxidase—To test if D-Fox functions as a ferroxidase, we measured ferroxidase activity in intact cells and in plasma membrane preparations derived from iron-deficient cells. The colorimetric assay is based on the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, measured with the Fe2+-specific chelator ferrozine. As shown in Table 1, the measured ferroxidase activity in iron-deficient cells, as well as in the corresponding plasma membrane, was greatly enhanced"
https://openalex.org/W1974877068,"Background p16INK4a tumor suppressor protein has been widely proposed to mediate entrance of the cells into the senescent stage. Promoter of p16INK4a gene contains at least five putative GC boxes, named GC-I to V, respectively. Our previous data showed that a potential Sp1 binding site, within the promoter region from −466 to −451, acts as a positive transcription regulatory element. These results led us to examine how Sp1 and/or Sp3 act on these GC boxes during aging in cultured human diploid fibroblasts. Methodology/Principal Findings Mutagenesis studies revealed that GC-I, II and IV, especially GC-II, are essential for p16INK4a gene expression in senescent cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and ChIP assays demonstrated that both Sp1 and Sp3 bind to these elements and the binding activity is enhanced in senescent cells. Ectopic overexpression of Sp1, but not Sp3, induced the transcription of p16INK4a. Both Sp1 RNAi and Mithramycin, a DNA intercalating agent that interferes with Sp1 and Sp3 binding activities, reduced p16INK4a gene expression. In addition, the enhanced binding of Sp1 to p16INK4a promoter during cellular senescence appeared to be the result of increased Sp1 binding affinity, not an alteration in Sp1 protein level. Conclusions/Significance All these results suggest that GC- II is the key site for Sp1 binding and increase of Sp1 binding activity rather than protein levels contributes to the induction of p16INK4a expression during cell aging."
https://openalex.org/W2028652903,"The junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) family is a key molecule in a process called transendothelial migration or diapedesis. Here, we report implications of JAM-C in cancer metastasis. We first determined the mRNA expression of JAMs in 19 kinds of cancer cell lines. JAM-C was expressed in most of tumors having potent metastatic properties. Especially in murine K-1735 melanoma cell lines, the highly metastatic sublines (M2 and X21) strongly expressed JAM-C when compared with the poorly metastatic ones (C-10 and C23). Next, we investigated the role of JAM-C in cancer metastasis by using human JAM-C (hJAM-C) gene-transfected HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells. In comparison with mock-transfected HT1080 cells, these cells showed a significant increase in the adhesion to various extracellular substrates and the invasion across a Matrigel™-coated membrane. The knockdown of hJAM-C using small interfering RNA resulted in the suppression of both the adhesion and the invasion of HT1080 cells, suggesting that endogenous hJAM-C might be involved in tumor metastasis. Finally, we studied the role of hJAM-C in an in vivo experimental metastatic model. The results showed that the overexpression of hJAM-C in HT1080 cells significantly decreased the life spans of the tumorbearing mice. In contrast, the knockdown of hJAM-C in HT1080 cells suppressed the weight gain of the lungs with metastatic colonies. We conclude that the expression of JAM-C promotes metastasis by enhancing both the adhesion of cancer cells to extracellular matrices and the subsequent invasion.

Cancer metastasis involves a series of events that include dissociation of malignant cells from a primary site, polarized proteolysis and migration, intravasation into the circulatory system, and adhesion to the vascular endothelium followed by extravasation, invasion, and growth at distant sites (1Woodhouse E.C. Chuaqui R.F. Liotta L.A. Cancer. 1997; 80: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Certain cell surface molecules are known to be involved in these processes. For instance, integrins play central roles in regulating cell adhesion, motility, invasion, and angiogenesis (2Koike C. Oku N. Watanabe M. Tsukada H. Kakiuchi T. Irimura T. Okada S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1238: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 3Kikkawa H. Kaihou M. Horaguchi N. Uchida T. Imafuku H. Takiguchi A. Yamazaki Y. Koike C. Kuruto R. Kakiuchi T. Tsukada H.

(5Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 43: S42-S51Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In particular, cell adhesion molecules play key roles in tumor adhesion and invasion, resulting in metastasis (6Cavallaro U. Christofori G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1552: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). When compared with normal tissues, malignant tumors are characterized by disrupted tissue architecture and deranged differentiation. Changes in the expression or function of cell adhesion molecules contribute to tumor progression both by altering the adhesion status of the cell and by affecting cell signaling (7Cavallaro U. Christofori G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 118-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). It has been reported that alteration of cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interactions accounts for the ability of cancerous cells to cross tissue boundaries and to disseminate to distant sites. Many adhesion molecules implicated in tumor metastasis have been identified (6Cavallaro U. Christofori G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1552: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and certain of them belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily (8Rojas M. Fuks A. Stanners C.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 527-533PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) family, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, has become a focus of study in relation to cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interactions. The JAM family, belonging to the larger cortical thymocyte Xenopus molecular family (9Aurrand-Lions M. Johnson-Leger C. Wong C. Du Pasquier L. Imhof B.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), is a glycoprotein. It has two immunoglobulin folds (VH and C2 type) and two extra cysteine residues in its extracellular region, a potential N-glycosylation site (s), and a PDZ protein-interacting domain in its intracellular region (10Chretien I.

These interactions represent the likely determinants for the diverse roles of JAMs such as junction assembly, platelet activation, and leukocyte transmigration (10Chretien I. Marcuz A. Courtet M. Katevuo K. Vainio O. Heath J.K. White S.J. Du Pasquier L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 4094-4104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In inflammation, the JAMs play an important role on the passage of leukocytes across interendothelial spaces (29Vestweber D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 30Chavakis T. Preissner K.T. Santoso S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 89: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Certain adhesion molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells are known to control sequential steps in leukocyte migration (31Muller W.A. Lab. Investig. 2002; 5: 521-533Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The steps of leukocyte migration are partly similar to those of cancer metastasis in several respects; e.g. both leukocytes and tumor cells need to adhere to the vascular bed and to cross the border of endothelial cells. In the present study, we investigated certain aspects of the participation of JAMs in cancer metastasis. At first, we determined the expression of JAMs in 14 cell lines and also in five sublines of the K-1735 murine melanoma. Next, we focused on the function of JAM-C in cancer metastasis and used HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080 cells) for metastatic studies. HT1080 cells transfected with human JAM-C (hJAM-C) were used in the experiment of cell adhesion, invasion, and in vivo metastasis for evaluating the functions of hJAM-C. The roles of endogenous hJAM-C were determined by examining the properties of HT1080 cells transfected with small interfering RNA for hJAM-C. This study provides the first evidence that hJAM-C promotes cancer metastasis. Cell Culture—Murine melanoma K-1735 cell lines were established by I. J. Fidler (The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) and kindly provided by Dr. J. Yokota (National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan). Human HT1080 fibrosarcoma, C8161 melanoma, AZ-P7a gastric carcinoma, Colo205 colorectal adenocarcinoma, SUIT-2 pancreatic carcinoma, K562 erythroleukemia, murine B16BL6 melanoma, and Colon26 NL-17 carcinoma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich), 100 units/ml penicillin (MP Biomedicals, Inc., Irvine, CA), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (MP Biomedicals). Human JAM-C-transfected HT1080 cells were grown in the same medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml hygromycin B (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. Osaka, Japan). Human A431 epidermoid carcinoma, HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma, HeLaS3 cervical cancer, Caco-2 colon carcinoma, murine Lewis lung carcinoma, and K-1735 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells were maintained in Ham’s F12 medium containing 10% FBS and the same antibiotics. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Reverse Transcription and PCR—Total RNA was isolated by using TRIzol® LS reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNAs were generated from total RNA samples (5 μg) by using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; and 72 °C for 10 min. The primers for human JAM-A were 5′-CGC GAT GGG GAC AAA GGC GC-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACC AGG AAT GAC GAG GTC-3′ (antisense); for human JAM-B, 5′-TAA AAA TCG AGC TGA GAT GAT AG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTA AAT TAT AAA GGA TTT TGT G-3′ (antisense); for human JAM-C, 5′-ACT TCT TCC TGC TGC TGC TT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCT GAA GTC GCC CTC CTC GT-3′ (antisense); for mouse JAM-A, 5′-ATG GGC ACC GAG GGG AAA GC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCA CAC CAG GAA CGA CGA GG-3′ (antisense); for mouse JAM-B, 5′-ATG GCG CTG AGC CGG CGG CT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCA GAT AAC AAA GGA CGA TT-3′ (antisense); for mouse JAM-C, 5′-ATG GCG AGG AGC CCC CAA GG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTA AAT TAT AAA GGA TTT TG-3′ (antisense); and for β-actin, 5′-TGA CGG GGT CAC CCA CAC TGT GCC CAT CTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTA GAA GCA TTT GCG GTG GAC GAT GGA GGG-3′ (antisense). The PCR products were applied onto 1.5% agarose gels and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide under UV light. Western Blotting—Anti-JAM-C antibody (goat polyclonal IgG) was purchased from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The cells on culture plates were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4, PBS). Cell extracts were prepared with lysis buffer composed of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1% SDS, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 μm leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μm pepstatin A. Total protein concentration was measured by using a BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cell extracts were subjected to 10 or 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After blocking for 1 h at room temperature with 5% skim milk in Tris-HCl buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS, pH 7.4), the membranes were incubated with 0.1 μg/ml antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Then, they were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:2000 to 1:10,000 for 1 h at room temperature. Each sample was developed by using chemiluminescent substrate (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). cDNA Cloning—The hJAM-C sequence was obtained from GenBank™ (accession number AF448478). Total RNA was isolated from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) by using TRIzol LS reagent and reverse-transcribed into single-stranded cDNA by using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). The fulllength cDNA of hJAM-C was PCR-amplified by using Ex Taq™ (TaKaRa BIO Inc., Shiga, Japan) with specific primers based on the hJAM-C nucleotide sequence that included BamHI and HindIII restriction sites: 5′-ACG TAA GCT TAT GGC GCT GAG GCG GCC ACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACG TGG ATC CTC AGA TCA CAA ACG ATG ACT-3′ (antisense). The PCR product was purified by use of a High Pure PCR product purification kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Restriction enzyme digestions of PCR product and pcDNA3.1/Hygro vector (Invitrogen) were carried out at 37 °C for 1 h. Both digestion products were purified with the purification kit and then ligated at 16 °C for 2 h with T4 DNA ligase (DNA ligation kit, Version 1, TaKaRa). Competent Escherichia coli JM109 cells (TaKaRa) were transformed with ligation mixture, plated on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates, and grown overnight at 37 °C. Colonies were screened for the insert by restriction enzyme digestion, and DNA sequencing was performed at Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Korea). Transfection with hJAM-C—Stable GFP transfectant of HT1080 fibrosarcoma was prepared as described previously (32Yamakawa S. Furuyama Y. Oku N. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2000; 23: 1264-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and used for transfection with hJAM-C. These cells were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3.1/Hygro vector containing either full-length hJAM-C or no insert by using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). Stable transfectant (hJAM-C/HT1080 or Mock/HT1080) was selected with 400 μg/ml hygromycin B. The expression of hJAM-C was confirmed by Western blotting as described above. For cell growth assay, hJAM-C/HT1080 or Mock/HT1080 cells (1.0 × 105 cells/dish) were cultured for 24, 48, 72, or 96 h. After staining with 0.5% trypan blue, the numbers of living cells were counted at each time point. Localization of hJAM-C—Human JAM-C/HT1080 or Mock/HT1080 cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The cells were then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, incubated with 0.1 μg/ml anti-JAM-C goat polyclonal antibody for 2 h, and immersed in 1.0 μg/ml Alexa Fluor® 555-labeled anti-goat IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes Inc., OR) for 1 h. Localization of hJAM-C was determined by using a LSM510 Meta confocal system (Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd.). Adhesion Assay—Ninety-six-well flat-bottomed plates were dry-coated with Matrigel™ (3 μg/well), fibronectin (0.75 μg/well), vitronectin (0.25 μg/well), laminin (1.25 μg/well), or type IV collagen (1.5 μg/well) and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Human JAM-C/HT1080 or Mock/HT1080 cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were allowed to adhere to each substrate-coated well at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the adherent cells were stained with crystal violet for 10 min. The pigment was extracted with 33% acetic acid for 5 min, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm as an indicator of adherent cells. Invasion Assay—The invasion was evaluated as the capacity of hJAM-C/HT1080 cells to pass through a Matrigel-coated transwell insert. BD Matrigel matrix (25 μg/well; BD Biosciences) was coated on a fluorescence-blocking micropore membrane of a culture insert (8-μm pore size, 0.28 cm2, Falcon HTS FluoroBlok™ inserts, BD Biosciences). The culture inserts were set into wells of a 24-transwell plate containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, which had not been heat-immobilized, as a chemoattractant. After the cell density had been adjusted to 5 × 105 cells/ml in serum-free medium, 5 × 104 cells in 100 μl were introduced into each culture insert. After incubation for 4–5 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator, the cells that traversed the Matrigel layer and attached to the lower surface of the filter were counted in five randomized fields under a fluorescence microscope. Transfection with siRNA—The nucleotide sequences of siRNA with a two-nucleotide overhang (underline) for hJAM-C were 5′-CAGGAUGGAGAAAGUUACAAGAACCAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGUUCUUGUAACUUUCUCCAUCCUGAU-3′ (antisense); those for luciferase were 5′-UGGUUUACCUAAAGGUGUACGAAUUAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAUUCGUACACCUUUAGGUAAACCAAU-3′ (antisense); and those for EGFP were 5′-GGCUACGUCCAGGAGCGCACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-UGCGCUCCUGGACGUAGCCUU-3′ (antisense). The sequences for hJAM-C, luciferase, and EGFP correspond to nucleotide regions 829–853, 612–636, and 118–141, respectively. The siRNAs for luciferase and EGFP were used as a control siRNA. All siRNAs were prepared by Hokkaido System Science Co. (Hokkaido, Japan). Stable GFP transfectant of HT1080 fibrosarcoma (31Muller W.A. Lab. Investig. 2002; 5: 521-533Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar) was transfected with siRNA by using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Forty-eight hours after the addition of siRNA/Lipofectamine 2000 complexes, the knockdown of hJAM-C was evaluated by Western blotting. In all experiments using siRNA, siRNA-transfected HT1080 cells were used at 48 h after the addition of these complexes. Western blotting and cell growth, adhesion, and invasion assays were performed by methods similar to those described above. Experimental Metastasis—The influence of the overexpression and the knockdown of hJAM-C on tumor metastasis were evaluated in an experimental pulmonary metastatic model. Cells were harvested from culture plates by brief exposure to 0.02% EDTA/PBS. After the cells had been centrifuged and resuspended in the medium, their concentration was adjusted to 5 × 106 cells/ml. For evaluating the effect of overexpression of hJAM-C on metastatic potential, hJAM-C/HT1080 or Mock/HT1080 cells (1 × 106 cells/mouse) were injected into the tail vein of 4-week-old BALB/c nu/nu male mice (Charles River Japan Inc., Kanagawa, Japan). The life spans of tumor-bearing mice were monitored (n = 10 for mock/HT1080, n = 11 for hJAM-C/HT1080). In another three mice in each group, the lungs were dissected, weighed, and photographed for evaluating metastasis at 19 days after implantation. For evaluating the effect of knockdown of hJAM-C on metastatic potential, hJAM-C siRNA- or EGFP siRNA-treated cells (1 × 106 cells/mouse) were injected into the tail vein of 9-week-old BALB/c nu/nu male mice (n = 4). The lungs with tumor metastases were dissected, weighed, and photographed at 38 days after implantation. Histochemical Analysis—The lungs with metastatic colonies were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetechnochemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and frozen at –80 °C. Six-micrometer lung sections were prepared by using a cryostatic microtome (HM 505E, Microm, Walldorf, Germany), stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and examined histopathologically. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis (mean value, S.D., independent t test) was performed by using Stat View® 4.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. The amounts of JAM transcripts in cancer cell lines were determined by reverse transcription-PCR. In this experiment, we used 19 kinds of cancer cells lines. Among them, human HT1080 fibrosarcoma, HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma, C8161 melanoma, SUIT-2 pancreatic carcinoma, AZ-P7a gastric carcinoma, and murine Lewis lung carcinoma, B16BL6 melanoma, Colon26 NL-17 carcinoma, K-1735 M2, and X21 melanoma cell lines were known to have highly metastatic characteristics. The transcripts of JAM-A were similar in amount regardless of the cancer cell lines (Fig. 1). In contrast, the expression levels of JAM-B and JAM-C were different among the various cell lines. The transcripts of JAM-C were detected in highly metastatic cell lines such as HT1080 fibrosarcoma, SUIT-2 pancreatic carcinoma, AZ-P7a gastric carcinoma, Lewis lung carcinoma, B16BL6 melanoma, and Colon26 NL-17 carcinoma (Fig. 1). To assess the relationship between the amounts of JAM transcripts in tumor cells and their metastatic potentials, the expression of JAM members was compared in K-1735 murine melanoma subpopulations having diverse biologic behavior (33Fidler I.J. Gruys E. Cifone M.A. Barnes Z. Bucana C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 67: 947-956PubMed Google Scholar). Each clone (C-10, C-23, M2, and X21) was previously established from the parent K-1735 cells. The in vivo metastatic potential of M2 and X21 sublines is very high, as is that of the parent K-1735 cells, whereas that of C-10 and C-23 clones is quite poor. As shown in Fig. 2A, the mRNA level of JAM-C was markedly up-regulated in the parent K-1735 and highly metastatic sublines (M2 and X21) when compared with that in the poorly metastatic sublines (C-10 and C-23). In contrast, the mRNA level of either JAM-A or JAM-B was not much different between the highly metastatic and poorly metastatic cells. Actual expression levels of JAM-C protein in K-1735 sublines determined by Western blotting correlated well with those of JAM-C mRNA (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Expression of JAMs in K-1735 murine melanoma. A, reverse transcription-PCR for detection of JAM-A, JAM-B, and JAM-C transcript was performed. C-10 and C-23 are poorly metastatic sublines, whereas M2 and X21 are highly metastatic ones. P indicates parent K-1735 melanoma. B, Western blotting analysis was performed to determine the expression of JAM-C protein in each K-1735 cell line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) JAM-C functions in cancer metastasis were explored by constructing hJAM-C-overexpressing HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells. HT1080 cells were transfected with hJAM-C-encoded pcDNA3.1/Hygro vector (hJAM-C/HT1080) or empty vector (Mock/HT1080). Overexpression of hJAM-C in hJAM-C/HT1080 cells was confirmed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3A, the amount of hJAM-C protein was very abundant in hJAM-C/HT1080 cells than in Mock/HT1080 cells. Human JAM-C in the transfectant was localized on the extensions of its plasma membrane (Fig. 3B). The forced expression of hJAM-C did not affect the cell growth rate (Fig. 3C). To evaluate the participation of hJAM-C in the interaction of the cells with ECM, the adhesion of hJAM-C/HT1080 cells to various ECM components was investigated. Human JAM-C expression in HT1080 cells significantly increased their adhesion to Matrigel, fibronectin, and vitronectin and slightly increased their adhesion to type IV collagen and laminin (Fig. 4A). Next, the effect of hJAM-C overexpression on tumor cell invasion was examined. The number of cells that invaded through a Matrigel-coated membrane was compared between hJAM-C/HT1080 and Mock/HT1080 cells. The migration of HT1080 cells was significantly accelerated by the overexpression of hJAM-C, suggesting that hJAM-C expression might be correlated with tumor malignancy (Fig. 4B). To confirm whether endogenous JAM-C was involved in the invasion, hJAM-C siRNA-transfected HT1080 cells were prepared. The expression of endogenous hJAM-C was observed in both control and luciferase siRNA-transfected HT1080 cells to some extent, and the knockdown of endogenous hJAM-C was confirmed in hJAM-C siRNA-transfected HT1080 cells (Fig. 5A). Transfection with hJAM-C siRNA did not affect the rate of cell growth (Fig. 5B). In an adhesion assay, the knockdown of hJAM-C inhibited the adhesion of hJAM-C siRNA-transfected HT1080 cells to ECM components (Figs. 4A and 5C). Especially, the knockdown of hJAM-C significantly reduced their adhesion to fibronectin and vitronectin. The invasion potential of hJAM-C siRNA-transfected HT1080 cells was significantly less than that of luciferase siRNA-transfected HT1080 cells, indicating that the knockdown of hJAM-C reduced tumor invasiveness (Fig. 5D). Finally, the influence of hJAM-C expression on the metastatic potential of HT1080 cells was examined in an experimental metastasis model. The formation of pulmonary metastases was observed in both the Mock/HT1080 cell-injected and the hJAM-C/HT1080 cell-injected group since HT1080 cells are highly metastatic by nature (data not shown). The mean survival times after tumor implantation were 18 ± 2 days for the hJAM-C HT1080 cell-injected group and 30 ± 8 days for the Mock/HT1080 cell-injected group (Fig. 6A). The life spans of the hJAM-C/HT1080 cell-injected group were significantly short when compared with those of the Mock/HT1080 cell-injected group (p < 0.01). Forced expression of hJAM-C caused 40% reduction of the life span of tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that hJAM-C expression promoted the pulmonary metastasis of HT1080 cells. At 19 days after the injection, the hJAM-C/HT1080 cell-injected group showed bloody lungs with metastatic colonies, which might occur due to the increased malignancy of the metastatic cells (Fig. 6B). Most of the mice injected with hJAM-C/HT1080 cells died before showing obvious differences in the lung weight gain between Mock/HT1080 and hJAM-C/HT1080 cell-injected mice. As shown in Fig. 6C, the results of the hematoxylin-eosinstaining showed the overexpression of hJAM-C-induced expansion of the metastatic tumors. Histochemical data also showed that the knockdown of hJAM-C in HT1080 cells suppressed the pulmonary metastasis of those cells (Fig. 6D). In the case of the injection of EGFP siRNA-transfected cells, the leakages of blood corpuscle cells were observed around the metastases. This phenomenon indicated that the progress of tumor metastasis of the cells transfected with hJAM-C siRNA was slower than that of cells transfected with EGFP siRNA. Furthermore, the knockdown of hJAM-C suppressed the weight gain of lungs with metastatic colonies after the injection of the cells in comparison with that of the cells transfected with EGFP siRNA (p = 0.0570, Fig. 6E). Invasion of metastatic tumor cells to the secondary colonizing organs is often compared with lymphocyte transendothelial migration since several common cell adhesion molecules, such as selectins and integrins, are involved in both lymphocyte and tumor cell migration. JAMs are known to participate in the transendothelial migration of lymphocytes (10Chretien I. Marcuz A. Courtet M. Katevuo K. Vainio O. Heath J.K. White S.J. Du Pasquier L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 4094-4104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the participation of JAMs in tumor angiogenesis has also been the focus of studies (34Naik M.U. Mousa S.A. Parkos C.A. Naik U.P. Blood. 2003; 102: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 35Lamagna C. Hodivala-Dilke K.M. Imhof B.A. Aurrand-Lions M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5703-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Another recent study demonstrated that JAM-C could mediate tumor cell-endothelial cell interactions and suggested the involvement of JAM-C in tumor cell metastasis (20Santoso S. Orlova V.V. Song K. Sachs U.J. Andrei-Selmer C.L. Chavakis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36326-36333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present study, to understand the participation of JAM family molecules in tumor metastasis, we first examined the mRNA levels of the JAM family in various cancer cells derived from human and rodent sources. As a result, we observed cell line-dependent differences in the mRNA level of JAM-C. Interestingly, most of the JAM-C-expressing cell lines in this study have often been used for experimental models of metastasis because of their high malignancy. In murine K-1735 melanoma cell lines, the highly metastatic sublines strongly expressed JAM-C when compared with the poorly metastatic ones. In addition, the expression levels of JAM-A and JAM-B on K-1735 cells did not correlate with the metastatic potential of these cells. These data suggested that JAM-C might be implicated in cancer metastasis. It has been reported that JAM-C shows only 32 and 36% identity to JAM-A and JAM-B, respectively (13Arrate M.P. Rodriguez J.M. Tran T.M. Brock T.A. Cunningham S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45826-45832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The intracellular region of JAM-C is slightly longer than that of JAM-A and JAM-B (13Arrate M.P. Rodriguez J.M. Tran T.M. Brock T.A. Cunningham S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45826-45832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The relative tissue distribution of each JAM shows a distinct pattern, resulting from cell typespecific expression of the individual JAM (9Aurrand-Lions M. Johnson-Leger C. Wong C. Du Pasquier L. Imhof B.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In this study, the unique expression pattern of JAM-C was observed in various cancer cell lines. These observations may explain the distinctive roles of JAM-C in cancer metastasis. The full open reading frame for hJAM-C displays 84% identity with that for murine JAM-C (mJAM-C) at the DNA level and 86% identity at the amino acid level (37Johnson-Leger C.A. Aurrand-Lions M. Beltraminelli N. Fasel N. Imhof B.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 2479-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of hJAM-C does not overlap entirely with that of the murine homologue (13Arrate M.P. Rodriguez J.M. Tran T.M. Brock T.A. Cunningham S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45826-45832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We also examined mJAM-C function in the invasion assay, with the result that overexpression of mJAM-C also promoted tumor invasion as well as hJAM-C did (data not shown). In this study, the roles of JAM-C in cancer metastasis were examined by using hJAM-C/HT1080 cells engineered to express hJAM-C abundantly. When compared with Mock/HT1080 cells, these cells showed significantly increased adhesiveness to various ECM components and invasiveness across Matrigel-coated membranes. In addition, the experiments using hJAM-C siRNA showed that endogenous hJAM-C would be involved in tumor adhesion and subsequent invasion. It is not clear whether JAM-C expression enhanced the adhesion of HT1080 cells to various ECM components directly or indirectly. In the case of JAM-A, it has been reported that it regulates β1 integrin expression and cellular adhesion property (36Mandell K.J. Babbin B.A. Nusrat A. Parkos C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11665-16674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It is possible that JAM-C may affect the cell adhesiveness by controlling other adhesion molecules. In addition, JAM-C may function cooperatively with certain proteinases since the degradation of Matrigel requires proteinase activity. Finally, we demonstrated that hJAM-C promoted pulmonary metastasis in the experimental metastatic model in vivo. We conclude that the expression of JAM-C promotes cancer metastasis by enhancing the adhesion of and subsequent invasion of cancer cells. The present study is the first report that demonstrates that JAM-C expression promotes tumor malignancy and thus provides a new insight into the mechanisms of cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2155667578,"The WASP-interacting protein (WIP) targets WASP/WAVE proteins through a constitutive interaction with an amino-terminal enabled/VASP homology (EVH1) domain. Parallel investigations had previously identified two distinct N-WASP binding motifs corresponding to WIP residues 451-461 and 461-485, and we determined the structure of a complex between WIP-(461-485) and the N-WASP EVH1 domain (Volkman, B. F., Prehoda, K. E., Scott, J. A., Peterson, F. C., and Lim, W. A. (2002) Cell 111, 565-576). The present results show that, when combined, the WIP-(451-485) sequence wraps further around the EVH1 domain, extending the interface observed previously. Specific contacts with three WIP epitopes corresponded to regions of high sequence conservation in the verprolin family. A central polyproline motif occupied the canonical binding site but in a reversed orientation relative to other EVH1 complexes. This interaction was augmented in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal directions by additional hydrophobic contacts involving WIP residues 454-459 and 475-478, respectively. Disruption of any of the three WIP epitopes reduced N-WASP binding in cells, demonstrating a functional requirement for the entire binding domain, which is significantly longer than the polyproline motifs recognized by other EVH1 domains. The WASP-interacting protein (WIP) targets WASP/WAVE proteins through a constitutive interaction with an amino-terminal enabled/VASP homology (EVH1) domain. Parallel investigations had previously identified two distinct N-WASP binding motifs corresponding to WIP residues 451-461 and 461-485, and we determined the structure of a complex between WIP-(461-485) and the N-WASP EVH1 domain (Volkman, B. F., Prehoda, K. E., Scott, J. A., Peterson, F. C., and Lim, W. A. (2002) Cell 111, 565-576). The present results show that, when combined, the WIP-(451-485) sequence wraps further around the EVH1 domain, extending the interface observed previously. Specific contacts with three WIP epitopes corresponded to regions of high sequence conservation in the verprolin family. A central polyproline motif occupied the canonical binding site but in a reversed orientation relative to other EVH1 complexes. This interaction was augmented in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal directions by additional hydrophobic contacts involving WIP residues 454-459 and 475-478, respectively. Disruption of any of the three WIP epitopes reduced N-WASP binding in cells, demonstrating a functional requirement for the entire binding domain, which is significantly longer than the polyproline motifs recognized by other EVH1 domains.

WASP also associates with WASP-interacting protein (WIP) via an enabled/VASP homology-1 (EVH1) domain at the WASP amino terminus; the majority of identified WAS mutations are located within this domain (5Rong S.B.

WIP, WIP-related (WIRE/WICH), and CR16 comprise the mammalian verprolin family and function as regulators of the actin cytoskeleton (14Aspenstrøm P. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5253-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The verprolins are proline-rich proteins that bind profilin and various Src homology 3 domain-containing proteins, and contain a conserved WASP binding domain (WBD) near the carboxyl terminus. N-WASP exists in cells predominantly as an inactive complex with WIP or CR16 (6Sasahara Y. Rachid R. Byrne M.J. de la Fuente M.A. Abraham R.T. Ramesh N. Geha R.S. Mol.

WASP/N-WASP is stabilized by its constitutive association with WIP (8Gallego M.D. de la Fuente M.A. Anton I.M. Snapper S. Fuhlbrigge R. Geha R.S. Int.

Disease-causing mutations in the EVH1 domain are thus thought to disrupt the complex with WIP and perhaps promote WASP degradation (16Lutskiy M.I. Rosen F.S. Remold-O'Donnell E. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The conserved binding surface of EVH1 domains includes an invariant tryptophan side chain that recognizes a proline-rich sequence in the target protein (17Ball L.J. Jarchau T. Oschkinat H. Walter U. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Zarrinpar A. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. Sci. STKE 2003. 2003; : RE8Google Scholar), although variations in the length, sequence, and binding orientation have been observed in structures of EVH1·target complexes. For example, our previous structural analysis (19Volkman B.F. Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Peterson F.C. Lim W.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the N-WASP EVH1 domain binds a short proline-rich sequence (462LPPPEP467) at the canonical binding surface but only in the context of a longer sequence (WIP residues 461-485) that includes ∼20 residues carboxyl-terminal to the polyproline motif. Moreover, upon determination of the WIP·EVH1 structure we found the orientation of the WIP polypeptide was reversed in comparison to all other EVH1 domain complexes (17Ball L.J. Jarchau T. Oschkinat H. Walter U. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Beneken J. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Nuriya M. Yuan J.P. Worley P.F. Leahy D.J.

Cell. 1999; 97: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In a parallel study, Zettl and Way (22Zettl M. Way M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1617-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) also showed that whereas substitution of the conserved EVH1 tryptophan abrogated binding, the polyproline motif alone was insufficient for WIP/N-WASP interaction. However, they also found that a 10-residue segment of WIP (451ESRFYFHPISD461) immediately amino-terminal to the LPPPEP sequence was by itself sufficient to bind the EVH1 domain. This interaction depended on conserved aromatic side chains (Phe454 and Phe456) but required no proline-rich sequence whatsoever. A subsequent analysis by Aspenstrøm (23Aspenstrøm P. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) indicated that the analogous aromatic motif and proline-rich region of WIRE are both required for the interaction with the EVH1 domain of WASP. Results from different groups thus have suggested that elements both within and adjacent to the WIP-(461-485) sequence are required for functional WIP-WASP interactions in vivo. To clarify these apparently discordant results, we determined the structure of a complex between the EVH1 domain of N-WASP and an extended WIP sequence that encompasses both of the previously defined interaction domains. Our results show that WIP wraps around the EVH1 domain and interacts with three distinct surfaces. As anticipated, residues at the amino-terminal end of the WIP fragment make specific contacts with the EVH1 domain. Binding measurements in cells demonstrated the essential role for multiple WIP epitopes conserved in the verprolin family. Protein Production—Residues 461-485, 451-485, or 451-493 from human WIP were linked to the EVH1 domain (residues 26-147) from rat N-WASP by the sequence GGLVPRGSGG and expressed with an amino-terminal His6 affinity tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. WIP·EVH1 fusion constructs were produced in Escherichia coli as described previously (19Volkman B.F. Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Peterson F.C. Lim W.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—NMR samples were prepared in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 20 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% sodium azide, and 10% 2H2O. NMR data were acquired at 30 °C on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer with a triple resonance CryoProbe and processed using NMRPipe (24Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11279) Google Scholar). Backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C assignments for exWIP·EVH1 were transferred from WIP·EVH1 (BMRB accession number 5554) and confirmed using three-dimensional HNCO, HNCA, and CCONH spectra. Side-chain assignments were completed using three-dimensional HCCH-TOCSY (total correlation spectroscopy) and 13C (aromatic)-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra. Structure Determination—Distance constraints were obtained from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC, and 13C (aromatic)-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra (τmix = 80 ms). Backbone φ and ψ dihedral angle constraints were generated from 1Hα, 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C′, and 15N shifts using TALOS (25Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). The structure was solved using CYANA (26Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar) followed by final refinement by X-PLOR in explicit water solvent (27Linge J.P. Williams M.A. Spronk C.A. Bonvin A.M. Nilges M. Proteins. 2003; 50: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Coordinates, chemical shifts, and restraints were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 2IFS). Binding Assays—Pulldown experiments using purified N-WASP EVH1 domain and GST fusion proteins with peptides from the WIP WBD were performed as previously described (22Zettl M. Way M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1617-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Expression of GFP-WIP WBD proteins and detection of actin tail formation in vaccinia-infected cells was performed as described previously (22Zettl M. Way M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1617-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). NMR Screening of WIP·EVH1 Complexes—Independent analyses of the interaction between N-WASP and WIP identified distinct EVH1 binding sequences, corresponding to WIP residues 451-461 (22Zettl M. Way M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1617-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and residues 461-485 (19Volkman B.F. Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Peterson F.C. Lim W.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The WIP-(461-485)·EVH1 structure revealed an extensive interaction surface unique in the EVH1 domain family (19Volkman B.F. Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Peterson F.C. Lim W.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of WIP at Ser488 was also shown to disrupt the WIP-WASP interaction, perhaps controlling WASP stability in the cell (6Sasahara Y. Rachid R. Byrne M.J. de la Fuente M.A. Abraham R.T. Ramesh N. Geha R.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1269-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This residue was not implicated in the WIP-WASP interaction but is immediately carboxyl-terminal to the WIP461-485 sequence that binds the N-WASP EVH1 domain. To examine the structural role of residues adjacent to the WIP-(461-485) WASP binding domain, we purified a series of 15N-labeled fusion proteins containing WIP fragments corresponding to residues 461-485, 451-485, or 451-493 linked to the amino terminus of the N-WASP EVH1 domain. The two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the WIP-(451-493)-EVH1 construct contained extremely broad lines and poor chemical shift dispersion and was deemed unsuitable for further analysis. In contrast, HSQC spectra of the complexes with WIP-(461-485) (WIP·EVH1) and WIP-(451-485) (exWIP·EVH1) were of high quality (Fig. 1A), and we compared them to assess whether residues 451-460 participate in the WIP·EVH1 interaction. WIP Residues 451-460 Extend the EVH1 Binding Site—Significant differences in the two-dimensional HSQC spectra for WIP·EVH1 and exWIP·EVH1 (Fig. 1A) are restricted to a small number of residues in three regions of the EVH1 sequence (Fig. 1B). No chemical shift perturbations are observed in residues of the EVH1 domain that contact WIP-(461-485) (Fig. 1C). Instead, shifts induced by WIP residues 451-460 are clustered in a region of the EVH1 domain near WIP residue Asp461 (Fig. 1D). These data are consistent with formation of a complex in which WIP residues 451-460 add to the previous binding interface by continuing to wrap around the EVH1 surface. Structure and Backbone Dynamics of the exWIP·EVH1 Complex—We determined the exWIP·EVH1 structure by NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2A and Table 1). Overall, the exWIP·EVH1 complex closely resembles the previously determined WIP·EVH1 structure, with the only obvious difference arising from the presence of additional WIP residues (Fig. 2B). For residues of the EVH1 domain, the backbone r.m.s.d. between the two structures is ∼1.5 Aå, and the conformation of WIP residues common to both structures (461-485) is similar (backbone r.m.s.d. ∼ 1.5 Aå). A cis configuration was observed for the His457-Pro458 peptide bond in the amino-terminal extension of the WIP sequence. The cis linkage, initially detected using the difference between the proline 13Cβ and 13Cγ chemical shifts (>9 ppm) (28Schubert M. Labudde D. Oschkinat H. Schmieder P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), was verified by structure calculations in which numerous short- and medium-range NOE distance constraints were satisfied only when the cis configuration was enforced.TABLE 1Statistics for 20 conformers of N-WASP EVH1 domain bound to the WASP binding domain of WIPExperimental constraintsDistance constraints (total)2411Long (EVH1 domain)922Intermolecular (WIP-EVH1)247Medium386Sequential473Intraresidue383Dihedral angle constraints (φ and Ψ)253Average atomic r.m.s.d. to the mean structure (Aå)N-WASP (35-137) and WIP (455-467, 473-478)aWIP residues 451-454, 468-472, and 479-485, N-WASP residues 26-34 and 138-147, and the connecting linker were excluded from the r.m.s.d. calculations because of dynamic disorder in these segments.Backbone (N, Cα, C′)0.82 ± 0.11Heavy atoms1.33 ± 0.12N-WASP EVH1 domain (residues 35-137)aWIP residues 451-454, 468-472, and 479-485, N-WASP residues 26-34 and 138-147, and the connecting linker were excluded from the r.m.s.d. calculations because of dynamic disorder in these segments.Backbone (N, Cα, C′)0.78 ± 0.10Heavy atoms1.30 ± 0.10WIP (residues 455-467, 473-478)aWIP residues 451-454, 468-472, and 479-485, N-WASP residues 26-34 and 138-147, and the connecting linker were excluded from the r.m.s.d. calculations because of dynamic disorder in these segments.Backbone (N, Cα, C′)0.75 ± 0.11Heavy atoms1.26 ± 0.19Deviations from idealized covalent geometryBond (Aå)0.016Angles (°)1.4r.m.s.d.From experimental distance restraints (Aå)0.018 ± 0.01From experimental dihedral restraints (°)0.81 ± 0.14Ramachandran statistics (% of WIP residues 453-479 and N-WASP residues 35-138)Most favored88.6Additionally allowed8.9Generously allowed1.9DisallowedbN-WASP residues Arg50, Leu85, Asn93, Arg101, and Asp110 were located in the disallowed region in one or more conformers of the structural ensemble.0.6a WIP residues 451-454, 468-472, and 479-485, N-WASP residues 26-34 and 138-147, and the connecting linker were excluded from the r.m.s.d. calculations because of dynamic disorder in these segments.b N-WASP residues Arg50, Leu85, Asn93, Arg101, and Asp110 were located in the disallowed region in one or more conformers of the structural ensemble. Open table in a new tab Heteronuclear 15N-1H NOE values exceeding 0.75 for most residues of the exWIP·EVH1 and WIP·EVH1 complexes show that the EVH1 domain is highly ordered (Fig. 2C). Prolines at WIP residues 463-465 and 467 create gaps in the NOE profile for both complexes, but the pattern for residues 466-480 includes a flexible region that reaches a minimum NOE value of ∼0.3 at Thr471. Maximal NOE values for WIP residues above 0.7 indicate that those portions of the WIP sequence adopt the same rotational correlation time as the EVH1 domain. WIP segments corresponding to residues 455-468 and 474-479 are ordered as a result of binding to the EVH1 domain and are connected by a short flexible linker. These observations are consistent with the calculated ensemble of structures. Distinct WIP Epitopes Bind an Elongated EVH1 Surface—The extended WIP sequence wraps more than halfway around the N-WASP EVH1 domain, using three distinct epitopes to form specific contacts (Fig. 3A) totaling 1033 Aå2 in buried surface area. Epitope 1 corresponds largely to residues identified by Zettl and Way (22Zettl M. Way M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1617-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as an alternative N-WASP binding domain. WIP residues 451-453 display no long-range NOEs and are unconstrained in the family of structures, but the 454FYFHPIS460 segment is well defined and closely associated with the EVH1 domain (Fig. 3B). Aromatic side chains of WIP residues Phe454 and Phe456 bind a hydrophobic surface that includes Val42 and Ala119 of N-WASP. This interaction is reflected in the large 1H and 13C chemical shift changes relative to the original WIP·EVH1 construct for the Ala119 methyl group as well as in new NOE cross-peaks to the Phe454 and Phe456 aromatic protons (Fig. 3C). Hydrophobic WIP residues Phe454, Phe456, and Ile459 contribute 197 Aå2, ∼20% of the total EVH1 contact surface. In contrast, two nearby aromatic WIP residues, Tyr455 and His457, are solvent-exposed and make no contacts with the EVH1 domain. This amino-terminal WIP epitope is linked to the polyproline sequence (epitope 2) by a well defined structural element consisting of the His457-Pro458 cis-peptide bond followed by a tight helical turn (residues 459-461). Epitope 2 comprises WIP residues 461-468 and contributes just over 40% of the total buried surface of the exWIP·EVH1 complex (414 Aå2). WIP residues 462LPPP465 surround the conserved Trp54 side chain of the EVH1 binding surface, similar to other EVH1·peptide complexes but with the polypeptide chain running in the opposite direction (19Volkman B.F. Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Peterson F.C. Lim W.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). NOE contacts between Pro463 and the N-WASP Trp54 indole NH are absent in the exWIP·EVH1 spectrum (Fig. 3D), suggesting that docking of the LPPP motif onto the conserved tryptophan side chain has been altered by the WIP-(451-460) extension. In an overlay with the original WIP·EVH1 complex, the polyproline helix of the new exWIP·EVH1 structure is shifted and unwound slightly. As illustrated in Fig. 3D, it appears as though the LPPP motif has been stretched toward the amino-terminally attached epitope 1 binding site. Epitope 3 is separated from the other binding elements by a flexible linker and contributes slightly less than 40% of the contact surface area (374 Aå2), mainly from Lys473, Tyr475, Pro476, and Ser477 (Fig. 3A). Although Lys478 does not make extensive contact with the EVH1 surface, it is positioned by the WIP-(475-478) helical turn to form a salt bridge with Glu90 of N-WASP (Fig. 3E). Binding of Individual WIP Epitopes to N-WASP—The NMR structure and 15N-1H NOE values (Fig. 2) show that WIP WBD epitopes 1 and 2 form a well defined structural unit connected by a cis-peptide bond and single helical turn, whereas epitope 3 is connected by a flexible linker that does not contribute to the binding interface. Our previous studies showed that WIP peptides containing either epitope 1 (22Zettl M. Way M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1617-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or both epitopes 2 and 3 (19Volkman B.F. Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Peterson F.C. Lim W.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) could bind the N-WASP EVH1 domain. Because epitope 3 contributes more than one-third of the total WIP·EVH1 binding surface, it seemed possible that it could bind as an isolated unit as observed for epitope 1. We used GST pulldown experiments to compare the binding of four WIP fragments from the WBD to the N-WASP EVH1 domain (Fig. 4, A and B). As demonstrated previously, WIP fragments A (residues 451-461) and B (461-485) bind strongly, but fragments C (459-472) and D (471-485), corresponding to epitopes 2 and 3 in isolation, do not. Thus, despite contributing a smaller portion of the total interaction surface, epitope 1 binds the N-WASP EVH1 domain independently, whereas epitopes 2 and 3 generate a stable N-WASP·WIP complex only when linked. Multiple WIP WBD Epitopes Are Required for N-WASP Binding in Vivo—WIP-(451-485) corresponds to a region of high sequence conservation in the verprolin family (Fig. 4C), and residues throughout the WIP WBD form specific N-WASP contacts. However, our in vitro binding results suggest that some of those contacts may be functionally redundant. To determine whether the entire WIP WBD is necessary for N-WASP binding in the cell, we mutated key conserved residues from each WIP epitope and measured the functional impact of WIP WBD overexpression on vaccinia actin tail formation. Recruitment of N-WASP to vaccinia is mediated by WIP binding to the EVH1 domain, and expression of the intact WIP WBD efficiently disrupts N-WASP recruitment and blocks actin tail formation (29Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Vincentelli R. Rabut G. Stewart D. Way M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). As shown previously (22Zettl M. Way M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1617-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), simultaneous alanine substitution for Phe454 and Phe456 eliminates almost completely the ability of WIP WBD to block actin tail formation (Fig. 4D). Likewise, substitution of Pro465, which contributes more than any other individual WIP residue to the binding interface, has the greatest impact in the actin tail formation assay. In contrast, substitution of Asp461 or Leu462, which connect epitopes 1 and 2, has only a modest effect. This demonstrates that the binding interactions of WIP WBD epitope 1 are not sufficient for the formation of a functional N-WASP·WIP complex. Similarly, the K478A substitution in epitope 3 diminishes the inhibition of actin tail formation by 50% relative to the wild-type WIP WBD. Although this effect is less dramatic than observed for P465A, it suggests that functional N-WASP·WIP complexes require contributions from all three WIP WBD epitopes (Fig. 4E). N-WASP promotes the formation of branched actin filaments by activating the Arp2/3 complex. Autoinhibited N-WASP (2Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins R.D. Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) is typically found in a complex with WIP, a member of the verprolin family (14Aspenstrøm P. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5253-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A conserved proline-rich domain near the WIP carboxyl terminus stabilizes N-WASP by binding its amino-terminal EVH1 domain (6Sasahara Y. Rachid R. Byrne M.J. de la Fuente M.A. Abraham R.T. Ramesh N. Geha R.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1269-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 15Ho H.Y. Rohatgi R. Lebensohn A.M. Le M. Li J. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2004; 118: 203-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Activation of N-WASP requires Cdc42 binding to relieve inhibitory intramolecular interactions and may also involve disruption of the WIP·N-WASP complex by Toca-1 binding (15Ho H.Y. Rohatgi R. Lebensohn A.M. Le M. Li J. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2004; 118: 203-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) or PKCθ-mediated WIP phosphorylation (6Sasahara Y.

Although WIP plays an important role in WASP/N-WASP function, many details about this complex remain obscure. We previously showed that the WIP polyproline motif binds N-WASP in the opposite direction relative to other EVH1·peptide complexes (19Volkman B.F. Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Peterson F.C. Lim W.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Specific interactions between WIP residues that are carboxyl-terminal to the polyproline motif (473KSYPSK478) and the EVH1 domain were thought to specify the reversal of the peptide ligand orientation. Here we find that conserved WIP residues amino-terminal to the proline-rich sequence make specific EVH1 contacts in an elongated version of the binding site observed in the original complex (Fig. 3). A similar example of a scaffolding interaction with bidirectional binding of composite linear motifs was observed recently for complexes that regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in yeast (30Bhattacharyya R.P. Remenyi A. Good M.C. Bashor C.J. Falick A.M. Lim W.A. Science. 2006; 311: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These structures demonstrate how semi-independent linear recognition motifs (31Puntervoll P. Linding R. Gemund C. Chabanis-Davidson S. Mattingsdal M. Cameron S. Martin D.M. Ausiello G. Brannetti B. Costantini A. Ferre F. Maselli V. Via A. Cesareni G. Diella F. Superti-Furga G. Wyrwicz L. Ramu C. McGuigan C. Gudavalli R. Letunic I. Bork P. Rychlewski L. Kuster B. Helmer-Citterich M. Hunter W.N. Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3625-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) can be used to make composite recognition motifs that are still recognized in an extended conformation with extremely high specificity. These three WIP epitopes comprise an ∼30-residue conserved WASP binding domain in the verprolin family (Fig. 4C). Although our in vitro WIP binding studies showed that peptides corresponding to epitope 1 alone (Fig. 4B) or to epitopes 2 and 3 (19Volkman B.F. Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Peterson F.C. Lim W.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) could bind N-WASP, other reports suggest that verprolins require the entire WBD to form functional complexes in vivo. For example, mutations in epitope 1 disrupted WIP·WASP binding (22Zettl M. Way M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1617-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and deletion of epitopes 2 and 3 abolished WIP binding to WASP in NK cells (32Krzewski K. Chen X. Orange J.S. Strominger J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Likewise, mutations in WIRE of either the conserved aromatic residues of epitope 1 or the polyproline motif of epitope 2 lost the ability to localize WASP to filamentous actin structures at the cell edge (23Aspenstrøm P. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Using our knowledge of the three-dimensional structure, we tested this hypothesis by separately mutating conserved residues in each epitope of the WIP-EVH1 interface. Disruption of any one of the three epitopes reduced the ability of the WBD to compete for N-WASP binding in a vaccinia actin tail formation assay (Fig. 4D). In lymphocytes, more than 95% of WASP is bound to WIP (6Sasahara Y. Rachid R. Byrne M.J. de la Fuente M.A. Abraham R.T. Ramesh N. Geha R.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1269-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Most of the mutations associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome map to the EVH1 domain of WASP (16Lutskiy M.I. Rosen F.S. Remold-O'Donnell E. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 33Derry J.M. Kerns J.A. Weinberg K.I. Ochs H.D. Volpini V. Estivill X. Walker A.P. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and probably disrupt its ability to bind WIP (19Volkman B.F. Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Peterson F.C. Lim W.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations that cause the most severe disease in WAS patients also result in the greatest reductions in WASP levels in circulating platelets, even though WASP mRNA levels remain normal in each case (16Lutskiy M.I. Rosen F.S. Remold-O'Donnell E. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Lutskiy et al. (16Lutskiy M.I. Rosen F.S. Remold-O'Donnell E. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 1329-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) therefore conclude that WIP plays a WASP-protective role in leukocytes and that disesase-causing mutations lead to degradation of the WASP protein and profound cytoskeletal defects. A similar interdependence of WIP-WASP protein levels was also recently observed in Caenorhabditis elegans (34Sawa M. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Patients with WAS display a range of symptoms that typically progress to severe immune dysfunction because of impaired leukocyte chemotaxis and defects in T and natural killer cell engagement with target cells (35Notarangelo L.D. Notarangelo L.D. Ochs H.D. Curr. Opin. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2005; 5: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). WIP also binds CrkL and is thought to link T cell receptor ligation to WASP activation through assembly of a ZAP-70·CrkL·WIP·WASP complex at the immunological synapse (6Sasahara Y. Rachid R. Byrne M.J. de la Fuente M.A. Abraham R.T. Ramesh N. Geha R.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1269-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Likewise, Tsuboi (9Tsuboi S. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 6576-6585Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that interactions between WASP and WIP (or WIRE) are essential for monocyte chemotaxis. Whether WIP simply preserves intact WASP at sufficient levels or contributes directly to key signaling events, inflammation and other immuoregulatory processes dependent on lymphocyte activation and leukocyte migration are clearly compromised in WAS patients because of disruption of this complex. Our previous structural study correlated WAS mutations with the WIP binding surface or core residues that might disrupt the tertiary structure of the EVH1 domain (19Volkman B.F. Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Peterson F.C. Lim W.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). WASP residues at the interface with epitope 1 (e.g. Val42 and Ala119) might be expected to correspond to additional disease-causing mutations that were previously unexplained, because they could interfere with the binding of WIP residues 451-460. No missense mutations for residues making direct contact with epitope 1 have been identified, but a cluster of mutations including Phe118, Glu121, and Glu123 surrounds Ala119 near the top of the α-helix. Further down the helix, WASP mutations A134T and R138P (N-WASP residues Ala124 and Arg128) were shown to disrupt WIP-WASP binding (36Luthi J.N. Gandhi M.J. Drachman J.G. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 150-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These substitutions may alter the epitope 1 binding surface by repositioning the helix and the packing of Ala119 between WIP residues Phe454 and Phe456 (Fig. 3B). Recently identified WAS missense mutations at positions Trp64 and Glu100 (Trp54 and Glu90 in N-WASP numbering) correspond to specific WIP·EVH1 interactions in epitopes 2 and 3, respectively (37Jin Y. Mazza C. Christie J.R. Giliani S. Fiorini M. Mella P. Gandellini F. Stewart D.M. Zhu Q. Nelson D.L. Notarangelo L.D. Ochs H.D. Blood. 2004; 104: 4010-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The W64R mutation would disrupt packing of the WIP polyproline motif (Fig. 3D), and it was correlated with a severe WAS phenotype. The E100D substitution associated with mild disease would likely weaken the conserved salt bridge formed with between Glu90 of N-WASP and Lys478 of WIP, as illustrated in Fig. 3E. WIP and N-WASP are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. Their interaction is required for proper signal transduction in multiple cellular contexts. Our results define the recognition interface for functional complexes between WIP and WASP/N-WASP. Each of three adjacent sequence epitopes, conserved across the verprolin family, makes key contacts with the amino-terminal EVH1 domain of WASP/N-WASP. Based on our measurements using specific WIP mutants and analysis of disease severity associated with specific WASP mutations, we conclude that disruption of any of the three binding epitopes will likely result in the loss of WASP protein and defects in hematopoietic cell signaling associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.

https://openalex.org/W2036048288,"Acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH) is an eukaryotic lipase that partially deacylates and detoxifies Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides and lipooligosaccharides (LPSs or LOSs, endotoxin) within intact cells and inflammatory fluids. In cell lysates or as purified enzyme, in contrast, detergent is required for AOAH to act on LPS or LOS (Erwin, A. L., and Munford, R. S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 16444–16449 and Katz, S. S., Weinrauch, Y., Munford, R. S., Elsbach, P., and Weiss, J. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 36579–36584). We speculated that the sequential interactions of endotoxin (E) with endotoxin-binding proteins (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), CD14, and MD-2) might produce changes in endotoxin presentation that would allow AOAH greater access to its substrate, lipid A. To test this hypothesis, we measured the activity of purified AOAH against isolated, metabolically labeled meningococcal LOS and Escherichia coli LPS that were presented either as aggregates (LOSagg or LPSagg) ± LBP or as monomeric protein (sCD14 or MD-2)-endotoxin complexes. Up to 100-fold differences in the efficiency of endotoxin deacylation by AOAH were observed, with the following rank order of susceptibility to AOAH: E:sCD14 ≥endotoxin aggregates (Eagg):LBP (molar ratio of E/LBP 100:1) ≫Eagg, Eagg:LBP (E/LBP ∼1, mol/mol), or E:MD-2. AOAH treatment of LOS-sCD14 produced partially deacylated LOS still complexed with sCD14. The underacylated LOS complexed to sCD14 transferred to MD-2 and thus formed a complex capable of preventing TLR4 activation. These findings strongly suggest that LBP- and CD14-dependent extraction and transfer of endotoxin monomers are accompanied by increased exposure of fatty acyl chains within lipid A and that the acyl chains are then sequestered when LOS binds MD-2. The susceptibility of the monomeric endotoxin-CD14 complex to AOAH may help constrain endotoxin-induced TLR4 activation when endotoxin and membrane CD14 are present in excess of MD-2/TLR-4.

In these circumstances, both GNB recognition and many responses depend upon activation of the exquisitely sensitive Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) by endotoxins, structurally unique and abundant glycolipids that occupy much of the outer leaflet of the GNB outer membrane (3Beutler B. Rietschel E.T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Maximal TLR4-dependent host responses to endotoxin are orchestrated through a sequential set of interactions of endotoxin with lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), membrane or soluble CD14, and soluble or TLR4-associated MD-2 (3Beutler B. Rietschel E.T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, 4Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Levis E.N. Weiss J.P. J.

Although timely mobilization of host responses is essential, equally important is the regulation of the duration and intensity of host responses to endotoxin to prevent over-exuberant and sustained responses that can result in severe pathological consequences (6Munford R.S. J. Endotoxin. Res. 2005; 11: 69-84PubMed Google Scholar). One mechanism of dampening host responses to endotoxin is for the host to modify endotoxin itself, converting it from a potent TLR4 agonist to a much weaker agonist with antagonistic properties. To date, the best described host endotoxin-detoxifying enzyme is acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH) (6Munford R.S. J. Endotoxin. Res. 2005; 11: 69-84PubMed Google Scholar). AOAH reduces endotoxin activity by catalyzing the release of secondary fatty acyl chains that are attached to primary 3-hydroxy fatty acyl chains within the bioactive lipid A region (7Hall C.L. Munford R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6671-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Munford R.S. Hall C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15613-15619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AOAH thus converts hexaacylated endotoxin species that are potent TLR4 agonists to pentaacylated or tetraacylated forms that have reduced or no agonist properties (9Darveau R.P. Curr. Opin.

Recent studies indicate that hexaacylated and partially deacylated or underacylated endotoxin react similarly with LBP, CD14, and MD-2 to form monomeric complexes with MD-2 (13Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Levis E.N. Weiss J.P. Gioannini T.L. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 4669-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, only hexaacylated endotoxin-human MD-2 is a potent TLR4 agonist (13Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Levis E.N. Weiss J.P. Gioannini T.L. J.

Munford R.S. Elsbach P. Weiss J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3376-3382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, either as purified enzyme or as part of a cell lysate, AOAH is virtually inactive against purified or membrane-bound endotoxin in buffered salt solutions in the absence of detergent (20Hagen F.S. Grant F.J. Kuijper J.L. Slaughter C.A. Moomaw C.R. Orth K. O'Hara P.J. Munford R.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8415-8423Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Staab J.F. Ginkel D.L. Rosenberg G.B. Munford R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23736-23742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that AOAH alone is unable to act efficiently on endotoxin when the fatty acyl chains of the amphipathic endotoxin are buried within pure supramolecular aggregates or the bacterial outer membrane. In contrast, the ability of AOAH to function physiologically suggests that other endotoxin binding molecules may act as “physiological detergents” to facilitate access of AOAH to the acyloxyacyl bonds that link the non-hydroxylated fatty acyl chains to lipid A. The delivery of endotoxin to MD-2, as is needed for TLR4 activation, is markedly enhanced by LBP- and CD14-dependent extraction and transfer of endotoxin monomers from purified endotoxin aggregates (Eagg) (4Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Levis E.N. Weiss J.P. J. Endotoxin Res. 2005; 11: 117-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the bacterial outer membrane (22Post D.M. Zhang D. Eastvold J.S. Teghanemt A. Gibson B.W. Weiss J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38383-38394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These steps are also albumin-dependent (23Gioannini T.L. Zhang D. Teghanemt A. Weiss J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47818-47825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), suggesting that Eagg (or membrane-bound endotoxin)-LBP and monomeric endotoxin-CD14 intermediates present endotoxin in a manner that partially exposes the fatty acyl chains and so require albumin to maintain endotoxin solubility in an aqueous environment. By making use of metabolically radiolabeled endotoxin from Neisseria meningitidis serotype B (24Giardina P.C. Gioannini T. Buscher B.A. Zaleski A. Zheng D.S. Stoll L. Teghanemt A. Apicella M.A. Weiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5883-5891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and from Escherichia coli, we now show that AOAH can act on endotoxin-LBP aggregates and, to an even greater extent, on monomeric endotoxin-sCD14 complexes, but much less on monomeric endotoxin-MD-2. These findings strongly support a model in which LBP- and CD14-dependent extraction and transfer of endotoxin expose fatty acyl chains that then become less accessible when endotoxin binds MD-2. The ability of AOAH to act on these protein-endotoxin intermediates provides a mechanism by which partial deacylation of endotoxin can take place before transfer to MD-2 and thus down-regulate TLR4 activation by endotoxin. LBP, BPI, and sCD14 were provided by Xoma (US) LLC (Berkeley, CA). Recombinant soluble human MD-2 containing a hexapolyhistidine tag on the carboxyl-terminal end was prepared using infection of High Five insect cells with baculovirus containing the cDNA for human MD-2 as described (25Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W. Ramaswamy S. Weiss J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4186-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Recombinant human AOAH was a generous gift from Zymo-Genetics (Seattle, WA). Chromatography matrices were purchased from GE Healthcare. Human serum albumin (HSA) was obtained as an endotoxin-free, 25% stock solution (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Glendale, CA). A soluble truncated CD14 (amino acids 1–156) containing a hexapolyhistidine tag at the carboxyl terminus was generated by infection of High Five insect cells with baculovirus containing the cDNA for this protein derived from recombination with the vector pBAC11 (Novagen) using the procedure previously described for soluble MD-2 (25Gioannini T.L.

Insect supernatant containing sCD14-(1–156) was dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl before adsorption to Ni Fast Flow-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare). The protein was purified on the AKTA Explorer 100 FPLC using an imidazole gradient for elution of adsorbed protein. HisLink resin (Promega) was used analytically to capture complexes by the method previously described (25Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W. Ramaswamy S. Weiss J.P. Proc.

Preparation of Metabolically Labeled Endotoxin and Endotoxin-Protein Complexes—[3H]LOS (specific activity 25,000 cpm/pmol) was isolated from an acetate auxotroph of N. meningitidis serogroup B after metabolic labeling as previously described (24Giardina P.C.

Aggregates containing various concentrations of LBP (LOSagg-LBP) or BPI (LOS-BPIagg) to be used in AOAH assays were prepared in situ (0.1 ml volume) by incubation of 1 nm [3H]LOSagg in Hanks’ buffered salt solution with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (HBSS+), pH 7.4, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% HSA for 20 min with the indicated concentration of either LBP or BPI (range from 0.1 to 10 nm) before addition of AOAH. [3H]LOS-sCD14, [3H]LOS-sCD14-(1–156), and [3H]LOS-MD-2 complexes were isolated by gel filtration chromatography using columns of Sephacryl HR S200 (1.6 × 30 cm or 1.6 × 70 cm) equilibrated in HBSS+, pH 7.4, 10 mm HEPES, ± 0.1% HSA. Isolated [3H]LOS-sCD14 (Mr ∼ 60,000) or [3H]LOS-sCD14-(1–156)-His6 (Mr ∼ 25,000) complexes were generated by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min of LBP with LOSagg (usual molar ratio 1:100) and either equimolar sCD14 (23Gioannini T.L.

In experiments where the effects of LBP concentration on formation of [3H]LOS-sCD14 were evaluated, the concentration of LBP ranged from 0.2 pm to 1 nm with a concentration of 1 nm [3H]LOS. Evaluation of the formation of monomeric [3H]LOS-sCD14 was monitored by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl HR S200 in PBS, pH 7.4, 0.03% HSA. [3H]LOS-MD-2 was prepared by treatment for 30 min at 37 °C of [3H]LOS-sCD14 with MD-2-containing insect culture medium followed by isolation of the monomeric [3H]LOS-MD-2 by Sephacryl HR S200 chromatography. For determination of the ability of AOAH-treated [14C]LOS-sCD14 to transfer partially deacylated [14C]LOS to MD-2, [14C]LOS-sCD14 (40 nm) was treated with AOAH (concentration adjusted based on method as described below) for 4 h at 37 °C. An aliquot (10 μl) was removed to evaluate the extent of deacylation by measuring ethanol-soluble radioactivity (i.e. 14C-free fatty acids) described below. The remainder of the sample was incubated with insect culture medium containing MD-2-His6 for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was resolved on Sephacryl HR S200 in PBS, pH 7.4, and the fractions corresponding to [14C]LOS-MD-2 were subjected to 14C-fatty acid analysis. [14C]lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (specific activity ∼6,000cpm/pmol) was isolated from an acetate auxotroph generated in E. coli BW25113 (BW25113 aceE). This strain was created by deletion-insertion mutagenesis according to the method of Datsenko and Wanner (26Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar) resulting in insertion of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene cassette within the aceE gene. Disruption of the aceE gene and insertion of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cassette was confirmed by PCR analysis and growth was shown to be acetate-dependent. Analysis of the 14C-fatty acids released by acid and alkaline hydrolysis of isolated LPS was performed as described below for LOS to determine the specific activity and composition of 14C-fatty acids in the isolated LPS. 3P. Prohinar, DeS. Zhang, and J. P. Weiss, unpublished data. [14C]LPSagg, [14C]LPS-sCD14, and [14C]LPS-MD-2 complexes were prepared as described above for [3H]LOS. In gel filtration chromatography, fractions (1 ml) were collected (flow rate 0.5 ml/min) at room temperature using AKTA Purifier™ FPLC. Aliquots of the collected fractions were analyzed by liquid scintillation spectroscopy using a Beckman LS liquid scintillation counter to detect radioactive LOS. Recoveries of LOS and LPS were >70%. All solutions used were pyrogen-free and sterile-filtered. After chromatography, selected peak fractions to be used in bioassays were pooled and passed through sterile syringe filters (0.22 or 0.45 μm) with greater than 90% recovery of radiolabeled material in the sterile filtrate. Fractions were stored under sterile conditions at 4 °C until needed. Sephacryl S200 columns were calibrated with Bio-Rad gel filtration standards that included thyroglobulin (Vo), γ-globulin, human serum albumin, ovalbumin, myoglobin, and vitamin B12 (Vi). AOAH Deacylation Assay—AOAH was stored at –80 °C, diluted in storage buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6, 0.9% NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100) (27Munford R.S. Erwin A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) immediately prior to usage and added to samples as indicated. The volume of AOAH in storage buffer added to samples was <1% of the total incubation volume. In addition to samples prepared in HBSS+, pH 7.4, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% HSA, LOSagg was incubated with AOAH in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 (27Munford R.S. Erwin A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as a positive control for AOAH activity. AOAH activity (1 microunit hydrolyzes 1 pmol fatty acid/min under the above detergent, acidic pH conditions) was assayed by determining release of radioactively labeled free fatty acids from metabolically labeled LOS or LPS. Duplicate samples (0.1 ml) of ∼1 nm [3H]LOS or 2 nm [14C]LPS were incubated with AOAH (750 pm, 15 microunits) for [3H]LOS or [14C]LPS for 2 h at 37 °C unless otherwise indicated. This amount of AOAH used/mol LOS (LPS) is similar to the ratios of enzyme and substrate previously used under detergent/acidic conditions (27Munford R.S. Erwin A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The quantity of fatty acid released was evaluated using the ethanol precipitation method (27Munford R.S. Erwin A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) wherein undigested and partially deacylated endotoxin are precipitated and released free fatty acids remain in the ethanol supernatant. Briefly, after incubation ± AOAH, samples (100 μl) were treated with 0.2 ml of ice-cold ethanol and kept at –20 °C overnight. Samples were spun for 10 min at 14,000 × g. Supernatants were removed; the pellets were washed with an additional 0.2 ml of ice-cold ethanol, incubated for 1 h at 0 °C, and spun for 10 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatant and rinses were combined for analysis of released radiolabeled free fatty acids by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Pellets were treated with 0.2 ml of 2% SDS for 30 min at 37 °C and then also evaluated by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Overall recovery of radioactivity was ≥90%. The results of reaction with AOAH are reported as % deacylation. Because only two of six moles of fatty acid of LOS/LPS attached to lipid A can be released by AOAH, 33% fatty acid release was defined as 100% deacylation. Fatty Acid Analysis—The 14C fatty acid content of various 14C-endotoxin and 14C-endotoxin-protein preparations was analyzed as previously described (22Post D.M. Zhang D. Eastvold J.S. Teghanemt A.

In brief, these complexes were subjected to acid hydrolysis (4 N HCl, 90 °C), neutralization, and base hydrolysis (4 N NaOH), followed by Bligh-Dyer extraction and recovery of the released 14C-labeled fatty acids in the chloroform phase. The 14C-fatty acids were resolved by reversephase TLC (0.2 mm HPTLC, RP-18; Merck) using acetonitrile/acetic acid (1/1) as the solvent system. 14C-fatty acids were identified by comparison to migration of 14C-fatty acid standards. Analysis was done using the Typhoon imaging system (GE Healthcare). LBP and sCD14 Increase LOS Susceptibility to AOAH—To determine whether LBP- and/or CD14-dependent alterations of endotoxin presentation render endotoxin more sensitive to AOAH, we examined the ability of AOAH to deacylate purified meningococcal LOS when LOS was presented either alone, as purified LOSagg, after treatment with LBP to produce LOSagg-LBP aggregates, or after sequential treatment with LBP and sCD14 to yield monomeric LOS-sCD14 complexes. All assays were performed in HBSS+, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% HSA, pH 7.4. The susceptibility of LOS to AOAH was markedly increased by pretreatment of LOSagg with LBP + sCD14 to convert LOSagg to monomeric LOS-sCD14 complex (Fig. 1A) (23Gioannini T.L. Zhang D. Teghanemt A. Weiss J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47818-47825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Incubation of LOSagg with LBP alone also markedly increased the susceptibility of LOS to AOAH at specific LBP:LOS ratios (Fig. 1B). The dose-dependence of LBP alone on AOAH susceptibility of LOSagg showed a complex bell-shaped curve (Fig. 1B) with maximum AOAH activity at a molar ratio of ∼1 mol LBP/100 mol LOS. At the concentration of LBP most favorable for AOAH activity, there was no detectable change in the gel sieving profile of the LOSagg (i.e. no detectable disaggregation of LOSagg) (28Iovine N. Eastvold J. Elsbach P. Weiss J.P. Gioannini T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7970-7978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The bell-shaped LBP dose-dependence of AOAH activity on LOSagg closely paralleled the bell-shaped LBP dose-dependence for extraction and delivery of LOS monomers to sCD14 (Fig. 1C). This suggests that LBP-catalyzed extraction and delivery of endotoxin monomers to sCD14 produce alterations in the orientation of endotoxin within LOSagg that favor access of AOAH to endotoxin, independent of CD14. In contrast to the effects of LBP, the closely related endotoxin-binding protein bactericidal permeability increasing protein (BPI) did not promote formation of LOS-sCD14 (28Iovine N. Eastvold J. Elsbach P. Weiss J.P. Gioannini T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7970-7978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or significantly increase LOSagg susceptibility to AOAH (Fig. 1B). Under optimal conditions, the susceptibility of LOSagg-LBP (100:1 mol/mol) and LOS-sCD14 to AOAH appeared to be similar (Fig. 1, A and B). We focused further biochemical characterization on the substrate properties of LOS-sCD14 because of the greater molecular homogeneity of LOS-sCD14 in comparison to LOSagg-LBP. Fig. 2 compares the rate of fatty acid release versus substrate concentration for two substrates, LOS-sCD14 and LOSagg. The data demonstrate a >10-fold increase in AOAH sensitivity conferred by extraction and delivery of endotoxin monomers from LOSagg to LOS-sCD14. Lineweaver-Burk analysis of the data for LOS-sCD14 indicated that the Km is ∼5 nm and the Vmax is 9.1 ± 0.05 fmol/min (n = 3). Reaction of LOS-sCD14 with AOAH Yields Partially Deacylated LOSAOAH-sCD14 Complex That Can React with MD-2 to Generate LOSAOAH-MD-2—The ability of LBP and CD14 to promote AOAH-dependent deacylation of LOS suggested a mechanism by which non-covalent host protein-mediated modifications in lipid A presentation might facilitate not only TLR4 activation but also AOAH-mediated lipid A deacylation that can reduce TLR4 activation (9Darveau R.P.

Zhang D. Levis E.N. Weiss J.P. Gioannini T.L. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 4669-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, provided the partially deacylated LOS remains bound to CD14 during and after AOAH treatment, deacylation of monomeric endotoxin-sCD14 complex (e.g. LOS-sCD14) could provide substrate for generation of AOAH-treated endotoxin-MD-2 complex (e.g. LOSAOAH-MD-2) that can then act as a TLR4 antagonist. Whether or not deacylated LOS remained associated with sCD14 could not be tested readily by comparing the gel sieving properties of the LOS-sCD14 complex before and after treatment with AOAH because of the closely similar Mr of sCD14 and AOAH. Therefore, we made use of a truncated form of recombinant CD14 (amino acid residues 1–156) containing a carboxyl-terminal hexapolyhistidine tag (sCD14-(1–156)-His6). This recombinant sCD14-(1–156)-His6 fully retains the reactivity of full-length sCD14 (356 residues) toward LOSagg-LBP and MD-2 (data not shown). LOS-sCD14-(1–156)-His6 was also a good substrate for AOAH (Fig. 3A). After AOAH treatment, the majority of the [3H]LOS cpm remained associated with sCD14-(1–156)-His6 as judged by gel sieving analysis (Mr ∼ 25,000) (Fig. 3B) and co-capture of [3H]LOSAOAH contained in the M"

The molecular mechanisms by which morphine decreases IL-2 are not fully understood. The production of IL-2 is tightly regulated by several transcription factors that bind to the IL-2 promoter.

Overexpression of either antisense CREM or CREB plasmid rescued morphine-induced inhibition of IL-2 promoter activity and protein production. In addition, we also found that chronic morphine treatment inhibited the acetylation and trimethylation of histones and decreased both DNA demethylation and accessibility of the IL-2 promoter.

Chronic morphine use and abuse has been documented to result in severe immune consequence and thus may pose a significant risk factor to opportunistic infection (1Roy S. Wang J. Keschenbach J.

IL-2 is a pivotal cytokine involved in T cell regulation, proliferation, and host defense mechanisms, and thus reduction in IL-2 synthesis may be a causative factor in the increased susceptibility to infections observed in the drug abused population. The expression of IL-2 is controlled almost entirely at the transcriptional level. IL-2 promoter studies with reporter constructs have shown that the essential elements for transcription lie within 300bp upstream of the start codon (11Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). This promoter region contains defined binding sites for many inducible transcription factors, such as NF-κB, NFAT, AP-1, and notably a cAMP-responsive element (CRE) site at –180 bp upstream of the start codon. Although all binding sites on the IL-2 promoter need to be occupied to ensure maximal transcription and production of IL-2 (12Powell J.D. Lerner C.G. Ewoldt G.R. Schwartz R.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6631-6639PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rothenberg E.V. Ward S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9358-9365Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); however, it has been shown that mutation of the CRE (cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) binding) site at position –180 bp completely abolishes IL-2 production (14Solomou E.E. Juang Y.T. Gourley M. Kammer G.M. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4216-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 15Solomou E.E. Juang Y.T. Tsokos G.C. J.

In addition, T cells of mice expressing a dominant negative form of CREB a marked decrease in the production of IL-2 was seen (16Barton K. Muthusamy N. Chanyangam M. Fischer C. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This CREB binding site also serves as the binding site for the transcriptional repressor, cAMP response element modulator (CREM), and/or the CREM isoform-inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) (12Powell J.D. Lerner C.G. Ewoldt G.R. Schwartz R.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6631-6639PubMed Google Scholar, 14Solomou E.E. Juang Y.T. Gourley M. Kammer G.M. Tsokos G.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4216-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The chromatin environment of a gene has a major influence on its transcription efficiency. In general genes that are packaged into highly compacted chromatin structures are maintained in a silent state, whereas highly expressed genes have a more loosely packaged chromatin conformation. Modification of the histones is performed by proteins that are also co-activators or co-repressors of gene transcription, such as the CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300. Rapid and transient induction of gene transcription is a feature of the response of immune cells to infection. Several studies have implicated histone modification to play a crucial role in IL-2 gene activation (17Chen X. Wang J. Woltring D. Gerondakis S. Shannon M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3209-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Wang L. Kametani Y. Katano I. Habu S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, many of the transcription factors that activate the IL-2 gene, such as NF-κB and NFAT, have been shown to interact with histone acetyltransferase proteins, such as CBP/p300, and to cooperate with these co-activators for transcriptional activation (19Ward S.B. Hernandez-Hoyos G. Chen F. Waterman M. Reeves R. Rothenberg E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2923-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Chronic morphine treatment of T cells leads to an increase in pertussis toxin-sensitive adenylyl cyclase activity and a subsequent increase in intracellular cAMP (20Wang J. Barke R.A. Charboneau R.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 6361-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is well established that cAMP signaling is inhibitory to T cell proliferation and effector functions. In particular, cAMP has been shown to inhibit the expression of T helper-1 cytokine genes (22Bodor J. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9544-9551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation coupled to the cAMP-dependent signal transduction pathways is mediated through a related family of DNA-binding proteins comprising the CREB, CREM (23De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 343-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CREM gene contains two alternatively utilized promoters, P1 and P2. The internal P2 promoter is activated by cAMP signaling to produce mRNAs encoding the ICER repressor isoforms, whereas the P1 promoter that encodes CREM isoforms is unresponsive to cAMP. These proteins encoded by CREM gene act as both activators and repressors of cAMP-mediated gene transcription. ICER is the most potent repressor (24Daniel P.B. Rohrbach L. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3923-3930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ICER protein consists mainly of the basic leucine zipper domain and, therefore, represses transcription either by heterodimerization with activating forms of CREB/CREM/ATF or other basic leucine zipper-containing transcription factors or by competition with these proteins for DNA binding (25Inada A. Hamamoto Y. Tsuura Y. Miyazaki J. Toyokuni S. Ihara Y. Nagai K. Yamada Y. Bonner-Weir S. Seino Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ICER induced by cAMP is a typical early response gene, with maximal expression levels being attained within 3–6 h of stimulation. In turn, ICER inhibits both its own transcription and the expression of other CRE-containing promoters (26Sassone-Corsi P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 355-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Induced expression of ICER through the cAMP signaling pathway has been implicated in several responses, including the suppression of T lymphocyte function, attenuation of Fas ligand expression in T and NK lymphocytes, and glucagon-mediated suppression of insulin gene expression in pancreatic B cell (27Bodor J. Bodorova J. Gress R.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Bodor J. Bodorova J. Bare C. Hodge D.L. Young H.A. Gress R.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 29Hussain M.A. Daniel P.B. Habener J.F. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this study, we show for the first time that morphine produces a dramatic increase in ICER expression in both naïve and activated T cells. Morphine-induced ICER competes with CREB in the context of CD28RE motif of IL-2 promoter. Since ICER lacks a transactivating domain, it fails to recruit CBP and p300. The CBP/p300 proteins, in addition to acting as co-activators, can also modulate histone acetylation, promote DNA demethylation, and increase accessibility to transcription factors. Since ICER expression fails to recruit CBP/p300 proteins, its expression results in a failure to maintain a transcriptionally competent conformation of chromatin state thus inhibiting activation of IL-2 transcription. These studies, therefore, indicate the existence of a potentially novel pathway for morphine-mediated suppression of IL-2 gene transcription. Experimental Animals—μ-Opioid receptor knock-out (MORKO) mice (129S × C57BL/6 genetic background) were produced as described previously by Loh and co-workers (30Roy S. Barke R.A. Loh H.H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 61: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Wild type (WT) mice (B6129SF2) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory. A maximum of four mice were housed per cage. Food and tap water were available ad libitum. The animal housing facilities were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle, with constant temperature (72 ± 1 °F) and 50% humidity. Preparation of T Lymphocytes and Treatment with Morphine—T lymphocytes from spleen and lymph node were enriched as described previously (20Wang J. Barke R.A. Charboneau R. Loh H.H. Roy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37622-37631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). T lymphocytes were treated for 24 h in medium (RPMI plus 10% NCS) containing either vehicle (control) or various concentrations of morphine (10 nm to 10 μm; National Institute on Drug Abuse, Rockville, MD). Cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 antibodies (2.5 μg/ml) and a rabbit anti-mouse cross-linking Ab (25 μg/ml) for varying periods, depending on the experiment. Three sets of experiments were performed, each in triplicate. Transfection and Detection of Luciferase Reporter Activity—In the transfection experiments involving primary lymphoid cells, murine splenic and lymph node T lymphocytes were harvested and treated with concanavalin A (3 μg/ml) for 18 h prior to transfection to allow uptake of DNA. T cells (2 × 107) were transiently transfected with 10 μg of IL-2 promoter firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (IL-2-GL3 –326 to +45; generous gift from Dr. Grabtrees's Laboratory, Stanford University) and 1 μg of control plasmid containing the pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) driving Renilla luciferase as an internal standard, in 0.8 ml of complete medium (RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin) by electroporation (BTX, 300 V, 50 ms, and 1 pulse). In the co-transfection experiments, 5 μg of plasmids (CREM α antisense, CREB, NF-κB p65, NFATc1) or appropriate control plasmids were used. After electroporation, the cells were rested for 2 h and then stimulated with anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (2.5 μg/ml) and a rabbit anti-mouse cross-linking Ab (25 μg/ml) or medium alone. In certain experiments, some cells were treated with morphine (10 nm to 10 μm) for 24 h prior to stimulation. Lysates were harvested at 6 h and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activity using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) with a luminometer (Turner TD20/20; Promega). All assays were done in triplicate, and luciferase values were normalized for transfection efficiency against Renilla luciferase activity as described previously (20Wang J. Barke R.A. Charboneau R. Loh H.H. Roy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37622-37631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Analysis—Binding of transcription factor CREM and CREB to the IL-2 promoter was investigated using the ChIP assay according to the protocol of Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, T lymphocytes were treated with 1% formaldehyde in tissue culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C. Cell samples were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cells were pelleted and lysed in SDS lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture). Samples were sonicated to shear DNA to lengths between 200 and 1000 bp. Subsequently, an aliquot of sheared DNA was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm sheared DNA length and standardize protein-DNA complex input for immunoprecipitation. The chromatin samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit antibody directed to CREM and p-CREB, CBP, p300, acetyl-histone H3, acetyl-histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnology), and trimethyl-histone H3 (lys4) (Abcam). Immune complexes were precipitated with salmon sperm DNA-bovine serum albumin-Sepharose beads. DNA was prepared by treatment with DNase- and RNase-free proteinase K and extraction with a QiaAmp DNA extraction kit. The following primer was used for PCR analysis of immunoprecipitated DNA as well as input samples: 5′-CCTAAATCCATTCAGTCAGTGTATGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGTGTGGCAGAAAGCATTACCT-3′ (reverse). This primer amplified a 93-bp region including the –180 and –160 site within –198 to –107 of IL-2 promoter. Western Blot—T lymphocytes were treated with morphine or vehicle for 24 h before stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 lasted for 2 h. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer. After one freeze/thaw cycle, lysates were centrifuged. Protein concentration was determined by a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. A quantity amounting to 5 μg of protein sample was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were then transferred to an ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by electroblotting. Incubating the membrane in Superblock (Pierce) for 1 h blocked nonspecific binding. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in primary Ab, CREM, CREB, and p-CREB. The blots were washed three times with TBST buffer and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-rabbit secondary Ab conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Western blot analysis was conducted according to standard procedures using Supersignal chemiluminescence detection substrate (Pierce). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—T lymphocytes from each mouse were adjusted to a final concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in 24-well plates and stimulated with anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (2.5 μg/ml) and a rabbit anti-mouse cross-linking Ab (25 μg/ml). The microtiter plates were then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Culture supernatant was analyzed using cytokine-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantification of ICER mRNA Transcripts by Reverse Transcriptase-PCR and Real-time PCR—ICER gene expression in T cells treated with morphine or vehicle was examined by RT and real-time PCR. The RT-PCR was conducted as described previously (20Wang J. Barke R.A. Charboneau R. Loh H.H. Roy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37622-37631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Real-time, SYBR Green PCR analysis was performed for ICER mRNA and 18 S rRNA, and relative quantification was performed using the ABI PRISM 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). ICER transcript levels were normalized to 18 S rRNA transcript levels from the same preparations of cDNA. Methylation-sensitive PCR Assay—Methylation-sensitive PCR assay was performed by using the promoter methylation PCR kit (Panomics, Redwood City, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions (31Esteve P.O. Chin H.G. Pradhan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, genomic DNA from T cells was prepared using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was digested with MseI (New England Biolabs). The methylated DNA fragments were isolated by a spin column affinity purification using MeCP2 and were amplified by PCR for subsequent visualization by agarose gel electrophoresis. The following primer was used for PCR analysis of methylated DNA: 5′-CCAGAGAGTCATCAGAAGAGGAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATAATATGGGGGTGTCACGA-3′ (reverse). This primer amplified a 109-bp region including the –68 CpG islands within –157 to –49 of IL-2 promoter. DNA Accessibility Assay—T cells were either treated with various concentrations of morphine or vehicle. Twenty-four hours after morphine treatment, T cells were stimulated with CD3 and CD28 for 18 h. T cells were harvested, resuspended in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA) with addition of Nonidet P-40. Nuclear pellets were harvested and washed in restriction enzyme buffer. Digestion was conducted at suggested temperatures with DraI for 1 h. DNA was extracted using a QIAmp DNA micro kit and amplified with primers flanking the IL-2 promoter that contained the digestion sites. Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. They were analyzed statistically by the unpaired t test between two groups and analysis of variance among multiple groups. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Chronic Morphine Treatment Inhibited Transcriptional Activation of IL-2 Promoter and IL-2 Protein Production—Prior studies have shown that IL-2 secretion and IL-2 mRNA expression can be inhibited in antigen-stimulated T cells by chronic treatment with morphine (10Wang J. Charboneau R. Balasubramanian S. Barke R.A. Loh H.H. Roy S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 527-536PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism for this mode of repression has never been defined, although previous work has established that c-fos and AP-1 was selectively inactivated in morphine-treated thymocytes (32Roy S. Chapin R.B. Cain K.J. Charboneau R.G. Ramakrishnan S. Barke R.A. Cell Immunol. 1997; 179: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Primary T cells respond to molecular signals that are initiated by the ligation of the T cell receptor and the CD28 class of co-receptors on its cell surface. These cell surface-initiated signaling events can be mimicked in vitro in primary T cells by the addition of anti-CD3 in the presence of antibodies that cross-link the CD28 surface receptor (33Coyle A.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Stimulation of primary T cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 leads to a significant increase in IL-2 gene activation and secretion as determined by transcriptional reporter assays and IL-2 enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent analysis, respectively. We initially investigated whether morphine treatment modulated IL-2 protein synthesis and gene transcription following activation of T cells with anti-CD3/CD28. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, morphine treatment inhibited both IL-2 promoter activity and IL-2 protein synthesis in activated T cells derived from WT mice in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of morphine were completely abolished in T cells derived from MORKO mice, suggesting that the effect of morphine is mediated through the μ-opioid receptor. Evaluation of the Effect of Exposure to Morphine on Intracellular cAMP Level—To address the possibility that the elevations of cAMP in morphine treated T lymphocytes induced the inhibition of IL-2 transcription, the effect of morphine on intracellular cAMP levels were examined. T lymphocytes were treated with morphine, the adenyly cyclase agonist forskolin, or morphine plus forskolin for 24 h, then cAMP was tested in naïve and 24-h anti-CD3/CD28 activated T cells. Morphine treatment resulted in detectable elevation of the cAMP levels in naïve T cells and markedly stimulated cAMP levels in activated T cells derived from WT mice. Morphine treatment also synergized with forskolin to result in a significant increase in intracellular cAMP (Fig. 1C). Chronic Morphine Treatment Induced ICER Expression in Both Naïve and Activated T Cells—We next investigated whether morphine-induced elevation in cAMP levels results in the induction of ICER expression in both naïve and activated T lymphocytes derived from WT mice. In untreated naïve T lymphocytes, ICER mRNA levels were undetectable. Treatment of naïve T lymphocytes with morphine for 24 h resulted in a modest increase in levels of ICER I-specific mRNA signal. However, morphine treatment in activated T lymphocytes induced both stronger ICER I and II specific mRNA signals (Fig. 2, A and B). Morphine treatment resulted in a parallel increase in ICER protein levels, which migrated at the expected band (13.5 kDa) (Fig. 2C; Ref. 34Liu Y. Kalintchenko N. Sassone-Corsi P. Aguilera G. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2006; 18: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast morphine treatment of activated T cells resulted in a significant decrease in phospho-CREB protein levels. Activation of T cells in the absence of morphine, however, resulted in time dependent increase in the phospho-CREB. Total CREB, however, was not altered following morphine treatment (Fig. 2D). Chronic Morphine Treatment Inhibited p-CREB and Enhanced CREM to Bind to the IL-2 Promoter in Activated T Cells—Because ICER/CREM was up-regulated and p-CREB was down-regulated by morphine in stimulated T cells, we wanted to determine whether morphine modulated the recruitment of these transcriptional factors to the IL-2 promoter in activated T cells. T cells derived from WT mice were treated with morphine (10 nm or 1 μm) for 24 h, then stimulated with anti-CD3 and CD28 for 6 h. T lymphocytes were fixed with formalin to cross-link DNA to proteins, sonicated, and the DNA-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated. The DNA was extracted and amplified with primers against a region of –198 to –107 of IL-2 promoter, including the –180 and –160 sites. Our results show that chronic morphine treatment inhibited the recruitment of p-CREB to the IL-2 promoter but promoted the recruitment of CREM to the IL-2 promoter (Fig. 3A). Although the CREM antibody recognizes all CREM isoforms, however, since only the ICER isoform is inducible by cAMP, it is very likely that the CREM antibody used for immunoprecipitation in the ChIP assay corresponds to ICER. Overexpression of CREB and Antisense CREM Achieved by Transfection of CREB and Antisense CREM-encoding cDNAs in Activated T Cells Abrogates the Morphine-induced Inhibition of IL-2 Transcription and Production—To further investigate whether CREB and ICER/CREM were involved in the suppression of IL-2 transcription and IL-2 protein production, we transfected activated T cells derived from WT mice with either a CREB overexpression plasmid or a CREM antisense plasmid. The empty vector containing plasmids served as controls. Transfection of T cells with the either the CREB overexpression plasmid or the CREM antisense plasmid resulted in enhanced transcriptional activity of IL-2 promoter and significant increase in IL-2 protein production. Overexpression of either CREB or antisense CREM/ICER significantly rescued morphine-induced inhibition of IL-2 promoter activity (Fig. 3C) and protein production (Fig. 3D). In contrast overexpression of NFAT and NF-κB p65 did not rescue the effect of morphine (Fig. 3, C and D). Overexpression of CREB and CREM knockdown was confirmed following transfection using Western blot analysis (Fig. 3C). Chronic Morphine Treatment Disrupted Recruitment of the CBP and p300 to the IL-2 Promoter—To further evaluate that the ICER isoform of CREM was associated with the –180 CRE site of IL-2 promoter, we investigated whether recruitment of CBP and p300 to the IL-2 promoter was disrupted following morphine treatment. Chronic morphine treatment resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the binding of CBP and p300 to the IL-2 promoter (Fig. 3B). These studies suggest that chronic morphine treatment enhances binding of ICER to the CRE. Since ICER lacks a transactivating domain, binding of ICER to the CRE leads to the uncoupling of CBP or its homologue, p300 (CBP/p300), abrogating early stages of transcriptional initiation of IL-2 promoter in activated T cells derived from WT mice. Morphine Treatment Decreased the Binding of Acetylated and Methylated Histones, thus Reducing Accessibility of IL-2 Promoter in Activated T Cells—Treatment of T cells with morphine has been shown to inhibit CD3 and CD28 activation of IL-2 gene transcription, which occur through the alteration of specific transcription factors, ICER and CREM. ICER and CREM, in turn, may function to recruit chromatin remodeling complexes. Since chromatin remodeling has been shown to be dependent on the modification of histone proteins by acetylation followed by trimethylation at K4 sites, we next examined the effect of morphine treatment on histone acetylation and trimethylation. Our results show that morphine treatment decreased binding of acetylated H3 and H4 and reduced binding of trimethylated H3K4 to the IL-2 promoter in T cell when compared with vehicle treated activated T cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Since histone acetylation of chromatin modulates the accessible status of a gene, we next investigated whether morphine treatment will inhibit the accessibility of the IL-2 gene to restriction endonucleases. T cells were treated with morphine and stimulated with anti-CD3 and CD28 for 24 h. Nuclei were prepared from these samples and incubated with restriction enzymes. As shown Fig. 4C, CD3 and CD28 leads to an increase in DraI accessibility for the primer set spanning the –180 and –160 site within –198 to –107 of IL-2 promoter. Morphine treatment of activated T cells significantly inhibited accessibility of IL-2 promoter to DraI (20–50% compared with morphine-untreated T cells) (Fig. 4C). Morphine Treatment Decreased the Demethylation of CpG Dinucleotides Induced by CD3 and CD28 within the IL-2 Promoter—Another epigenetic modulation that can affect IL-2 gene expression is methylation of genomic DNA at CpG dinucleotides; therefore, we next tested whether morphine might influence the level of DNA methylation at the IL-2 locus. We examined the DNA methylation status of the CpG island flanking the –68 region within the IL-2 promoter using methylation-sensitive PCR assay. As shown in Fig. 4D, morphine treatment prevented the demethylation of CpG dinuucleotides induced by CD3 and CD28 within the IL-2 promoter. Both innate and adaptive immune function requires careful regulation. In most case, regulation of immune response is mediated by cytokines. The majority of reports, including our previous studies, indicate that morphine treatment inhibits T helper 1 (Th1) immune responses, usually starting with the inhibition of IL-2 (35Sacerdote P. Limiroli E. Gaspani L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2003; 521: 106-116PubMed Google Scholar, 36Roy S. Wang J. Gupta S. Charboneau R. Loh H.H. Barke R.A. J. Neuroimmunol. 2004; 147: 78-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 37Roy S. Balasubramanian S. Sumandeep S. Charboneau R. Wang J. Melnyk D. Beilman G.J. Vatassery R. Barke R.A. Surgery. 2001; 130: 304-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which morphine down-regulates IL-2 expression remains to be established. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which morphine modulates IL-2 expression may lead to several important paradigms with relevant application to the developing of new approaches to the treatment of the devastating infection caused by drug abuse. Here we are first to demonstrate that ICER/CREM is a critical transcriptional factor for the negative regulation of IL-2 transcription following morphine treatment in CD3- and CD28-activated T cells. Intracellular cAMP accumulation induced by chronic morphine treatment has been reported in certain types of cells, including immune cells (20Wang J. Barke R.A. Charboneau R. Loh H.H. Roy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37622-37631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Roy S. Wang J. Charboneau R. Loh H.H. Barke R.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 6361-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous findings, we found that intracellular cAMP levels were elevated following chronic morphine treatment in both naïve and activated T cells. Moreover, we also found that the cAMP-mediated inhibition of IL-2 transcription induced by chronic morphine treatment correlated with ICER expression in both naïve and activated T cells. ICER is produced from the CREM gene using an alternative promoter located internally and the translated protein product structurally contains only the leucine zipper domain. ICER heterodimerizes with the CREB/ATF-1 family and the AP-1 family of transcription factors and represses their activity (38Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 39Della Fazia M.A. Servillo G. Sassone-Corsi P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 22-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 40Mioduszewska B. Jaworski J. Kaczmarek L. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Previous findings indicated that the CD28-responsive element (CD28RE), a composite DNA binding element consisting of NFAT and CRE-like motifs in position –180 of IL-2 promoter has a high affinity for ICER binding as well as NFAT/ICER complexes, suggesting that ICER directly mediates transcriptional attenuation of IL-2 expression (20Wang J. Barke R.A. Charboneau R. Loh H.H. Roy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37622-37631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, a direct role of ICER in cAMP-mediated inhibition of cytokine and chemokine gene expression has been demonstrated in transgenic mice expressing ICER under the control of the lymphocyte-specific proximal lck promoter. On stimulation, transgenic thymocytes overexpressing ICER exhibited reduced levels of IL-2 and IFN-γ and failed to express MIP-1α and MIP-1β. Moreover, splenic T cells from ICER transgenic mice showed a defect in proliferation and lacked a mixed lymphocyte reaction response, suggesting that ICER-mediated transcriptional attenuation of cytokine and chemokine gene expression may compromise the T cell response (41Bodor J. Feigenbaum L. Bodorova J. Bare C. Reitz Jr., M.S. Gress R.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 1053-1059PubMed Google Scholar). As we have shown here, chronic morphine treatment induced high levels of cAMP and with concurrent increase in ICER mRNA expression in both naïve and activated T cells. Western immunoblot analysis confirmed that in these conditions the ICER mRNA is translated efficiently into ICER protein. Furthermore, chronic morphine treatment inhibited p-CREB binding to IL-2 promoter at the –180 and –160 site and disrupted recruitment of CBP and p300 to the IL-2 promoter. These results, therefore, reveal that ICER may play an important role in morphine-induced transcriptional inhibition of IL-2. Significant chromatin remodeling occurs selectively across the IL-2 promoter upon T cell activation in both murine primary CD4+ T cells and EL-4 T cells. There appears to be an interdependence between chromatin remodeling and the formation and maintenance of stable transcription factor complexes on the promoter. Two models of chromatin remodeling on inducible IL-2 promoters have been presented by some groups. In the first model chromatin remodeling is dependent on the presence of specific transcription factors that recruit remodeling complexes to the promoter region (42Rao S. Gerondakis S. Woltring D. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3724-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the second model recruitment of remodeling complexes is preceded by other events on the chromatin such as post-translational modifications, for example by acetylation or phosphorylation, of the histone tails of nucleosomes on the IL-2 promoter (43Thomas R.M. Gao L. Wells A.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4639-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The CBP/p300 proteins in addition to acting as co-activators can also modulate histone acetylation. Although cAMP has been shown to inhibit transcription by preventing the binding of NFAT and NF-κB factors to the IL-2 promoter (44Tsuruta L. Lee H.J. Masuda E.S. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Arai N. Arai K. Yokota T. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5255-5264PubMed Google Scholar), we show here that overexpression of NFAT and NF-κB did not rescue chronic morphine-induced suppression of IL-2 transcription and production, but overexpression of CREB could rescue the inhibitory effects of morphine. Furthermore, ChIP assays demonstrate that chronic morphine treatment decreased the recruitment of CBP/p300 to the IL-2 promoter and reduced acetylated H3 and H4 associated with the IL-2 promoter. Since histone acetylation in the regulatory region of the IL-2 gene results in chromatin remodeling, promotes accessibility, and is closely correlated with IL-2 gene expression, from our data we conclude that chronic morphine treatment modulates IL-2 gene transcription both at the transcription and epigenetic levels. DNA methylation is inversely related to IL-2 transcriptional activity (45Bird A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 208-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). T cell activation results in the demethylation of CpG sites within IL-2 promoter (43Thomas R.M. Gao L. Wells A.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4639-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The epigenetic changes, including active demethylation of a specific CpG site, recruitment of Oct-1, and changes in histone modifications are necessary and sufficient to enhance the transcription of IL-2 promoter stimulated by CD3 and CD28 (46Murayama A. Sakura K. Nakama M. Yasuzawa-Tanaka K. Fujita E. Tateishi Y. Wang Y. Ushijima T. Baba T. Shibuya K. Shibuya A. Kawabe Y. Yanagisawa J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Our results show that morphine treatment decreased DNA demethylation at the –68 CpG islands within the IL-2 promoter following CD3 and CD28 activation. This site has been shown by several studies to be demethylated following T cell activation (43Thomas R.M. Gao L. Wells A.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4639-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 47Bruniquel D. Schwartz R.H. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies by Murayama et al. (46Murayama A. Sakura K. Nakama M. Yasuzawa-Tanaka K. Fujita E. Tateishi Y. Wang Y. Ushijima T. Baba T. Shibuya K. Shibuya A. Kawabe Y. Yanagisawa J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) show that methylation of this critical site decreased DNA accessibility and inhibited T cell activation. Our studies suggest that modulation of CpG demethylation at the –68 CpG island is a potential epigenetic mechanism by which morphine regulates IL-2 gene. In summary, chronic morphine treatment results in an increase in cAMP levels with a concurrent up-regulation of the cAMP-inducible repressor ICER/CREM and a down-regulation of p-CREB expression in activated T cells. Furthermore, ICER competes for p-CREB binding to the CREs. This leads to the uncoupling of CBP/p300, thereby abrogating IL-2 transcription. In addition, chronic morphine treatment decreased the acetylation of histones 3 and 4, decreased H3K4 trimethylation, prevented demethylation of a crtical CpG site, and decreased accessibility of the IL-2 promoter to endonuclease digestion. These studies show for the first time a transcriptional and epigenetic regulatatory mechanism involved in the inhibition of IL-2 by morphine. We thank Dr. Gerald R.

They share a large N-terminal domain and a C-terminal FATC domain in addition to the unique serine/threonine protein kinase (PIKK) domain that is different from classical protein kinases. However, structure-function relationships of PIKKs remain unclear. Here we have focused on one of the PIKK members, SMG-1, which is involved in RNA surveillance, termed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), to analyze the roles of conserved and SMG-1-specific sequences on the intrinsic kinase activity. Analyses of sets of point and deletion mutants of SMG-1 in a purified system and intact cells revealed that the long N-terminal region and the conserved leucine in the FATC domain were essential for SMG-1 kinase activity. However, the conserved tryptophan in the TOR SMG-1 (TS) homology domain and the FATC domain was not. In addition, the long insertion region between PIKK and FATC domains was not essential for SMG-1 kinase activity. These results indicated an unexpected feature of SMG-1, i.e. that distantly located N- and C-terminal sequences were essential for the intrinsic kinase activity.

NMD mediates rapid degradation of mRNAs bearing premature termination codons generated by genome mutations and by errors that occur during processes including transcription and splicing (5Maquat L.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). NMD removes aberrant mRNAs containing premature termination codons from cells, thereby protecting them from accumulation of non-functional or potentially harmful truncated proteins encoded by aberrant mRNAs. In mammals, SMG-1 directly phosphorylates Upf1, a central component of NMD, at the serine/threonine-glutamine-rich ((S/T)-Q-rich) motif in the C terminus of Upf1, followed by dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (3Yamashita A.

In addition to RNA surveillance, a recent study suggested the possible involvement of SMG-1 in genome surveillance in mammalian cells (8Brumbaugh K.M. Otterness D.M. Geisen C. Oliveira V. Brognard J.

PIKKs have intrinsic serine/threonine kinase activity and are distinguished from other kinases by their unique catalytic domain (PIKK domain) similar to lipid PI3K catalytic domain, and their huge molecular weight (270–470 kDa) (9Bakkenist C.J.

Care. 2005; 8: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PIKKs are also characterized by their highly conserved C-terminal region known as the FATC (FRAP, ATM, TRRAP, C-terminal) domain (13Bosotti R. Isacchi A. Sonnhammer E.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 225-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Except for SMG-1, the FATC domain is located nearby the PIKK domain and is critical for basal kinase activities of mTOR and DNA-PKcs (14Priestley A. Beamish H.J. Gell D. Amatucci A.G.

Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Although sequences are quite different among family members, the N-terminal region of PIKKs, including that of SMG-1, seems to have a similar structure. Computational and three-dimensional analyses predicted that N-terminal regions of DNA-PKcs, ATM, ATR, and mTOR contained many helical repeats such as HEAT (huntingtin, elongation factor 3, A subunit of PP2A, TOR1) repeat, TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat), and ARM (armadillo) repeats (18Perry J.

Biol. 2004; 145: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).In addition to common conserved features in PIKKs, SMG-1 has unique sequences. The TOR SMG-1 homology (TS) domain, which we renamed from FRBH (FKBP-rapamycin binding homology) domain of mTOR (supplemental Fig. 1A) (3Yamashita A. Ohnishi T. Kashima I. Taya Y. Ohno S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2215-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence suggesting that SMG-1 interacts with the FKBP-rapamycin complex (2Denning G. Jamieson L. Maquat L.E. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22709-22714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 3Yamashita A. Ohnishi T. Kashima I. Taya Y. Ohno S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2215-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the N-terminal region of SMG-1 shows unique conserved sequences (one-specific conserved region, OCR) among species (OCR1–OCR3) (supplemental Fig. 1B). In addition, human SMG-1 has a quite large insertion sequence between the PIKK domain and the FATC domain (supplemental Fig. 1A) (1Grimson A. O'Connor S. Newman C.L. Anderson P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7483-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 3Yamashita A. Ohnishi T. Kashima I. Taya Y. Ohno S.

Although these features suggest involvement of these unique sequences in the activity of SMG-1, structure-function relationships of SMG-1 remain completely unknown.In this study, we investigated the structure-activity relationships of human SMG-1. For this purpose, we constructed a variety of point and deletion mutants and evaluated their kinase activities both in vitro and in vivo. Our analysis revealed that the FATC domain was important for SMG-1 kinase activity, and the essential amino acid residue for SMG-1 kinase activity was different from that of mTOR, but another conserved amino acid was required. Surprisingly, the N terminus of SMG-1, which is far from the catalytic domain, strongly affected SMG-1 kinase activity. On the other hand, the long insertion region between the PIKK domain and the FATC domain was not critical for SMG-1 kinase activity. Taken together, this first comprehensive analysis of relationships of kinase activity and structural features of SMG-1 suggested that SMG-1 activity was provided through both the N-terminal region and FATC domains.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—The SR vector based on FLAG-SMG-1 wild type (WT) has been described previously (7Kashima I. Yamashita A. Izumi N. Kataoka N. Morishita R. Hoshino S. Ohno M. Dreyfuss G. Ohno S. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). FLAG-SMG-1 D2331A encoding a kinase-dead mutant of SMG-1 was created by subcloning His-SMG-1 D2331A (3Yamashita A. Ohnishi T. Kashima I. Taya Y. Ohno S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2215-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) digested with ApaI/SalI into FLAG-SMG WT digested with ApaI/XhoI. For FLAG-SMG-1 L3646A and W3653A, BglII/BamHI fragments encoding the C-terminal region of SMG-1 were subcloned into pBluescript, and point mutations were inserted by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Stratagene). FLAG-SMG-1 WT was digested with XhoI/NheI to remove the FATC domain, and the XhoI/NheI fragment of subcloned plasmids containing the mutation was inserted into it. For FLAG-SMG-1 W1962F, KpnI/EcoRI fragment encoding the TS domain of SMG-1 was subcloned into pBluescript, and point mutations were inserted by site-directed mutagenesis, as described above. FLAG-SMG-1 WT was digested with EcoRV, and the EcoRV fragment of the subcloned plasmid containing the mutation was inserted into it. For FLAG-SMG-1-(Δ1–152), -(Δ1–617), -(Δ1–800), -(Δ1–998), -(Δ1–1377), -(Δ1–1478), -(Δ1–1708), -(Δ1–1859), and -(Δ1–2066): SmaI/XhoI (Δ1–152), SpeI/XhoI (Δ1–617), Eco122I/XhoI (Δ1–800), HindIII/XhoI (Δ1–998), ApaI/XhoI (Δ1–1377), EcoRV/XhoI (Δ1–1478), KpnI/XhoI (Δ1–1708), or DraI/XhoI (Δ1–152) fragments from FLAG-SMG-1 WT were inserted into SR-FLAG vectors. For Δ631–649, Δ631–679, Δ631–791, and Δ746–791: the SpeI fragment encoding the OCR1 of SMG-1 was subcloned into pBluescript, and PCR-based deletion mutants were constructed using the primers for Δ631–649 (5′-TAGCGCCCACATCCCTATTA-3′ and 5′-GCTGTTCACTTCCCTGCCATT-3′); Δ631–679 (5′-TAGCGCCCACATCCCTATTA-3′ and 5′-TTTATCTCTAGTAGCCTCAGTT-3′); Δ631–791 (5′-TAGCGCCCACATCCCTATTA-3′ and CAGAGATGTGTCGATGTTTGC-3′); and Δ746–791 (5′-TGCGTATGTTTCAGACTTCC-3′and 5′-CAGAGATGTGTCGATGTTTGC-3′). Thereafter, the SpeI fragment of subcloned and deleted plasmids was inserted into FLAG-SMG-1 WT digested with SpeI. For Δ994–999, the SpeI fragment encoding OCR2 was subcloned into pBluescript and digested by EcoT22I and self-ligated. Afterward, the BstX1 fragment of deleted subcloned plasmids was inserted into SR-FLAG-SMG-1 WT digested with BstX1. For Δ912–967 and Δ912–1014, the SpeI/HindIII fragment encoding OCR2 was subcloned into pBluescript, and PCR-based deletion mutants were constructed using the primers for Δ912–967 (5′-AGATGCTGTCCTTTGGCAG-3′ and 5′-GGCCATGGTAACAACCAAC-3′) and Δ912–1014 (5′-AGATGCTGTCCTTTGGCAG-3′ and 5′-AATCGCCAAACTTGTCAGGAC-3′). Thereafter, the BstX1 fragment of deleted subcloned plasmids was inserted into SR-FLAG-SMG-1 WT digested with BstXI. For Δ1375–1477, FLAG-SMG-1 WT was digested by ApaI/HindIII, blunt-ended, and self-ligated, and for Δ1675–1708, FLAG-SMG-1 WT was digested by Eco52I and EcoRV, and also blunt-ended, and self-ligated. For Δ2771–3254, Δ2771–3359, Δ2513–3490, and Δ2513–3579, the BglII/BamHI fragment encoding the C-terminal and 3′UTR regions of SMG-1 were subcloned into pBluescript, and PCR-based deletion mutants were constructed using the primers for Δ2771–3254 (5′-GGTACAAAGGGCAGAAATAATA-3′ and 5′-CAGCGACTCAAGTGGGCAGG-3′); Δ2771–3359 (5′-GGTACAAAGGGCAGAAATAATA-3′ and 5′-ACTGGTCTTGAACATCCTATTG-3′); Δ2513–3490 (5′-TATTTCCTCCAGTAGTTTGCCC-3′ and 5′-ACCTTGAAAGAACTGAAAAC-3′); Δ2513–3579 (5′-TATTTCCTCCAGTAGTTTGCCC-3′ and 5′-AGTGTTGCTTGTAGTCCTAAA-3′). Thereafter, the EcoRI/XhoI fragments of the subcloned and deletion plasmid were inserted into FLAG-SMG-1 WT EcoRI/XhoI-digested plasmid.Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T cells and HeLa TetOff (Clontech) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics and were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For the in vitro kinase assay experiments, HEK293T cells (2 × 106 cells for the in vitro kinase assay and 1 × 107 cells for the kinase amount-dependent in vitro kinase assay) were transfected with the indicated FLAG-SMG-1 mutant plasmids using Polyfect (Qiagen) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), and cells were collected after 36–48 h.Depletion of endogenous proteins by RNA interference was carried out by using siRNAs as described by Usuki et al. (21Usuki F. Yamashita A. Kashima I. Higuchi I. Osame M. Ohno S. Mol. Ther. 2006; 14: 351-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), except the transfection reagents. The following target sequences were used: non-silencing (5′-AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′) and SMG-1 3′ UTR (5′-GGAAGAUUUGAUGCAUUCATT′-3′). Non-silencing siRNAs that were guaranteed to show no gene silencing activity were commercially prepared by Qiagen. HeLa TetOff cells were transfected with small interfering (siRNA) duplexes (as above) at a final concentration of 70 nm using RNAifect (Qiagen). At 36 h post-transfection, the cells were trypsinized and reseeded in 12-well plates. After a further 24 h, the cells were transfected with the same siRNAs together with 1 μg of the indicated FLAG-SMG-1 constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were harvested 48 h after the second transfection.Protein Detection and Quantification—Samples were separated by 5.5–12% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed using the indicated antibodies with a standard ECL system (GE Biosciences). Anti-SMG-1, Upf1, phospho-Upf1 (3B8), SMG-7 antibodies were generated as done previously (3Yamashita A. Ohnishi T. Kashima I. Taya Y. Ohno S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2215-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 6Ohnishi T. Yamashita A. Kashima I. Schell T. Anders K.R. Grimson A. Hachiya T. Hentze M.W. Anderson P. Ohno S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1187-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and the anti-FLAG M2 antibody was purchased from Sigma. Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining was performed according to standard procedures. To measure the amounts of immunopurified mutant proteins from ∼150 to 430 kDa, silver staining was used, because Western blotting efficiency was largely different for each molecular weight of mutants (supplemental Fig. 2). Silver staining was performed using the Silver Quest silver staining kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocols. Signals were scanned by LAS 3000 (Fuji film) and quantified by MultiGauge (Fuji film). Phosphoproteins were detected by autoradiography using BAS 2500 (Fuji film), and signals were quantified as described above.In Vitro Kinase Assay—FLAG-SMG-1 proteins were immunopurified from transiently transfected HEK293T cells. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer F (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 1.2 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 100 nm okadaic acid (Calbiochem), and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)), and FLAG-SMG-1 proteins were collected on anti-FLAG affinity gels (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in lysis buffer F and twice in kinase reaction buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH at pH 7.5, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MnCl2). Kinase reactions were performed for 15 min at 30 °C in 50-μl kinase reaction mixtures (kinase reaction buffer containing 5 μg of substrate, 5 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). As substrate, GST or GST fusion peptides containing Upf1 serine 1078 (3Yamashita A. Ohnishi T. Kashima I. Taya Y. Ohno S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2215-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) were used. To measure the kinase amount shown in Fig. 1, immunopurified FLAG-tagged mutants were eluted twice with 50 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 1 mg/ml FLAG peptide for 30 min at 4 °C. The eluted proteins and BSA (as control) were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Amounts of eluted proteins were calculated from a BSA standard curve, and eluted proteins were used in an in vitro kinase assay, as described above.To detect phosphorylated substrate, the reaction products were separated by 12% polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were stained with CBB. The gels were then dried, phosphoproteins were detected by autoradiography, and signals were quantified as described above. To measure the amount of SMG-1 proteins, the same reaction products were separated by 5.5% polyacrylamide gels, and Western blotting (Figs. 2 and 4B) or silver staining (Figs. 1, 3, and 4A) was performed to detect SMG-1 proteins. After that, the membranes or stained gels were subjected to autoradiography to measure autophosphorylation. The kinase activity or the autophosphorylation levels of SMG-1 proteins in Figs. 2, 3, 4 was corrected by phosphorylated signals of substrates or SMG-1 proteins themselves divided by the number of moles of SMG-1 proteins measured as descried above. Statistical analysis was performed by using Student's t test.FIGURE 4The N-terminal region of SMG-1 is essential for kinase activity.

Ohnishi T. Kashima I. Taya Y. Ohno S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2215-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) as a substrate. Previous reports showed that SMG-1 associated with other NMD-related proteins such as Upf1 and SMG-7 (3Yamashita A. Ohnishi T. Kashima I. Taya Y. Ohno S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2215-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 7Kashima I. Yamashita A. Izumi N. Kataoka N. Morishita R. Hoshino S. Ohno M. Dreyfuss G. Ohno S. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), but immunopurified recombinant SMG-1 did not show any signs of contaminations in silver staining (Fig. 1B, lanes 6–10) and Western blotting (data not shown), indicating the high purity of the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, substrate phosphorylation depended on the amount of FLAG-SMG-1 WT. Furthermore, the fact that FLAG-SMG-1 D2331A, a kinase inactive point mutant in the PIKK catalytic domain (3Yamashita A. Ohnishi T. Kashima I. Taya Y. Ohno S.

Similar results were also obtained when phosphate incorporation into SMG-1 was evaluated (data not shown). To simplify the assay system, we also performed a kinase assay without elution of FLAG-SMG-1 proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Important amino acids for SMG-1 kinase activity in the TS and FATC domains. A, kinase activity of FLAG-SMG-1 point mutants. HEK293T cells were transfected with either an empty vector, FLAG-SMG-1 WT, FLAG-SMG-1 D2331A, FLAG-SMG-1 W1962F, FLAG-SMG-1 L3646A, or FLAG-SMG-1 W3653F expression vector. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay with GST-Upf11072–1085 as substrate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Recombinant SMG-1 levels were determined by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody, and substrates were detected by autoradiography followed by CBB staining. B, results in A were quantified by densitometric analysis with the Image Gauge software and were normalized against data for the FLAG-SMG-1 WT-transfected sample. The black bars indicate the kinase activity of SMG-1 proteins for GST-Upf11072–1085, and the white bars indicate autophosphorylation levels of SMG-1 proteins.

Therefore, we first tested point mutants in which conserved amino acids between SMG-1 and PIKKs were changed using the above kinase assay system. We constructed the W1962F point mutant in which tryptophan at residue 1962 in the TS domain was replaced with phenylalanine. The corresponding residue in mTOR (Trp-2027) was critical for kinase activity (supplemental Fig. 1A) (22Vilella-Bach M. Nuzzi P. Fang Y. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); however, FLAG-SMG-1 W1962F retained kinase activity and autophosphorylation, and kinase activity was ∼50% compared with FLAG-SMG-1 WT (Fig. 1, C and D, and Fig. 2). This suggested that tryptophan 1962 in the TS domain was not critical for SMG-1 kinase activity, which was different from the results for mTOR.The next set of point mutants that we used were point mutants (L3646A and W3653F) in the FATC domain, in which conserved leucine or tryptophan between FATC domains in PIKKs were substituted with alanine or phenylalanine essential for the basal/regulatory kinase activity of mTOR (16Takahashi T.

https://openalex.org/W2130605611,"Ketopantoate reductase (KPR, EC 1.1.1.169) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of ketopantoate to pantoate, an essential step for the biosynthesis of pantothenate (vitamin B5). Inhibitors of the enzymes of this pathway have been proposed as potential antibiotics or herbicides. Here we present the crystal structure of Escherichia coli KPR in a precatalytic ternary complex with NADP+ and pantoate bound, solved to 2.3 A of resolution. The asymmetric unit contains two protein molecules, each in a ternary complex; however, one is in a more closed conformation than the other. A hinge bending between the N- and C-terminal domains is observed, which triggers the switch of the essential Lys176 to form a key hydrogen bond with the C2 hydroxyl of pantoate. Pantoate forms additional interactions with conserved residues Ser244, Asn98, and Asn180 and with two conservatively varied residues, Asn194 and Asn241. The steady-state kinetics of active site mutants R31A, K72A, N98A, K176A, S244A, and E256A implicate Asn98 as well as Lys176 and Glu256 in the catalytic mechanism. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies with these mutants further demonstrate the importance of Ser244 for substrate binding and of Arg31 and Lys72 for cofactor binding. Further calorimetric studies show that KPR discriminates binding of ketopantoate against pantoate only with NADPH bound. This work provides insights into the roles of active site residues and conformational changes in substrate recognition and catalysis, leading to the proposal of a detailed molecular mechanism for KPR activity."
https://openalex.org/W2078609739,"Abstract Human biliverdin reductase (hBVR), a dual specificity kinase (Ser/Thr/Tyr) is, as protein kinase C (PKC) βII, activated by insulin and free radicals (Miralem, T., Hu, Z., Torno, M. D., Lelli, K. M., and Maines, M. D. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 17084–17092; Lerner-Marmarosh, N., Shen, J., Torno, M. D., Kravets, A., Hu, Z., and Maines, M. D. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 102, 7109–7114). Here, by using 293A cells co-transfected with pcDNA3-hBVR and PKC βII plasmids, we report the co-immunoprecipitation of the proteins and co-purification in the glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay. hBVR and PKC βII, but not the reductase and PKC ζ, transphosphorylated in assay systems supportive of activity of only one of the kinases. PKC βII K371R mutant protein (“kinase-dead”) was also a substrate for hBVR. The reductase increased the Vmax but not the apparent Km values of PKC βII for myelin basic protein; activation was independent of phospholipids and extended to the phosphorylation of S2, a PKC-specific substrate. The increase in substrate phosphorylation was blocked by specific inhibitors of conventional PKCs and attenuated by sihBVR. The effect of the latter could be rescued by subsequent overexpression of hBVR. To a large extent, the activation was a function of the hBVR N-terminal chain of valines and intact ATP-binding site and the cysteine-rich C-terminal segment. The cobalt protoporphyrin-activated hBVR phosphorylated a threonine in a peptide corresponding to the Thr500 in the human PKC βII activation loop. Neither serine nor threonine residues in peptides corresponding to other phosphorylation sites of the PKC βII nor PKC ζ activation loop-derived peptides were substrates. The phosphorylation of Thr500 was confirmed by immunoblotting of hBVR·PKC βII immunocomplex. The potential biological relevance of the hBVR activation of PKC βII was suggested by the finding that in cells transfected with the PKC βII, hBVR augmented phorbol myristate acetate-mediated c-fos expression, and infection with sihBVR attenuated the response. Also, in cells overexpressing hBVR and PKC βII, as well as in untransfected cells, upon treatment with phorbol myristate acetate, the PKC translocated to the plasma membrane and co-localized with hBVR. hBVR activation of PKC βII underscores its potential function in propagation of signals relayed through PKCs."
https://openalex.org/W1995290686,"The low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1B (LRP1B) is a large endocytic receptor that was first identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene. In the current investigation we demonstrate that LRP1B undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis in a γ-secretase-dependent process. The released intracellular domain (ICD) then translocates to the nucleus via a nuclear localization signal that is present within this domain. ICD release first requires shedding of the LRP1B ectodomain, which appears to be catalyzed by a member of the metalloproteinase family. Employing site-directed mutagenesis studies, we identified lysine residues 4432 and 4435 and arginine 4442 as key amino acids important for ectodomain shedding of LRP1B. We also demonstrate that an LRP1B minireceptor as well as the ICD domain alone suppresses anchorage-independent growth of LRP1B-deficient neuroglioma cells (H4 cells). Interestingly, abrogating ectodomain shedding resulted in a loss of the ability of LRP1B minireceptors to suppress anchorage-independent growth.

Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar, 2Liu C.X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Yaklichkin S.Y. Lisitsyn N.A. Genomics. 2000; 69: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The LRP1B gene is frequently inactivated by homozygous genomic deletions or by the expression of aberrant mRNA transcripts (1Liu C.X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar). In human esophagus cancer cell lines and primary tumors the LRP1B gene was shown to be inactivated by transcriptional silencing through hypermethylation of its promoter CpG island (3Sonoda I. Imoto I. Inoue J. Shibata T. Shimada Y. Chin K. Imamura M. Amagasa T. Gray J.W. Hirohashi S. Inazawa J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3741-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Homozygous deletions of LRP1B have also been reported in human liver cancers (4Pineau P. Marchio A. Nagamori S. Seki S. Tiollais P. Dejean A. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and urothelial cancers (5Langbein S. Szakacs O. Wilhelm M. Sukosd F. Weber S. Jauch A. Lopez B.A. Alken P. Kalble T. Kovacs G. Lab. Investig. 2002; 82: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). By conventional and array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis, loss of the LRP1B allele was noted in endocervical adenocarcinomas of uterus (6Hirai Y. Utsugi K. Takeshima N. Kawamata Y.

Thus, collective data indicate that this gene is inactivated during cellular transformation, suggesting that LRP1B is a candidate tumor suppressor gene. Structurally, LRP1B is closely related to LRP1, a receptor that recognizes numerous ligands and is essential for normal development (7Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Like LRP1, LRP1B contains a furin cleavage site (REKR) within a β-propeller domain that is cleaved by furin during receptor trafficking (8Liu C.X. Li Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 29639-29646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The major structural differences between LRP1 and LRP1B occur within their intracellular domains (ICD). First, the LRP1B ICD contains an alternatively spliced exon (exon 90) that is not present in LRP1 (1Liu C.X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the LRP1B ICD contains a cluster of basic residues (KRKRRTK) that is similar to basic clusters in BRCA2 tumor suppressor which have been shown to function as a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (11Yano K. Morotomi K. Saito H. Kato M. Matsuo F. Miki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Currently, the physiological function of LRP1B remains unknown. In mice, LRP1B expression is primarily restricted to the brain, adrenal glands, salivary gland, and testis (12Marschang P. Brich J. Weeber E.J. Sweatt J.D. Shelton J.M. Rich-ardson J.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3782-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, in humans, LRP1B is widely expressed (13Li Y. Lu W. Bu G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Like LRP1, LRP1B is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells where it is thought to attenuate the migration of these cells by regulating activity and function of the PDGFR-β (9Tanaga K. Bujo H. Zhu Y. Kanaki T. Hirayama S. Takahashi K. Inoue M. Mikami K. Schneider W.J. Saito Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1422-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mice in which the LRP1B gene has been deleted develop normally (12Marschang P. Brich J. Weeber E.J. Sweatt J.D. Shelton J.M. Rich-ardson J.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3782-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), possibly due to its restricted expression pattern and functional compensation by other members of the LDL receptor superfamily. Studies using LRP1B minireceptors have revealed that this receptor recognizes ligands such as the receptor-associated protein, urokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activator (8Liu C.X. Li Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and Pseudomonas exotoxin A (15Pastrana D.V.

Acta. 2005; 1741: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that are also recognized by LRP1, revealing that LRP1B and LRP1 exhibit overlapping ligand specificity. A number of transmembrane receptors have been found to undergo regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). The common features of RIP involve ectodomain shedding of the transmembrane protein, generating a membrane-bound product with a short ectodomain, which is then cleaved within the transmembrane domain releasing the ICD. The first transmembrane proteins discovered to undergo RIP were Notch (16De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J.

To begin to investigate the biological function of LRP1B, we initiated studies to determine whether LRP1B also undergoes RIP. Our results revealed that LRP1B undergoes proteolytic processing via a γ-secretase-mediated release of the ICD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LRP1B suppresses anchorage-independent growth of neuroglioma cells (H4 cells) and that this function requires LRP1B proteolysis. LRP1B Expression Vector Constructs—All of the transmembrane domain-containing truncated constructs of mLRP1B4 (8Liu C.X. Li Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol.

The PCR fragments were cloned into the BamHI site and XhoI site of the pcDNA3 vector by using the following primer sets: LRP1B 425, 5′-AATAATGGATCCCCATGCTTGGATTTAGCATGCGAATTTCTT-3′ and 5′-TTTCATCTCGAGTTATGCCACTGTCTCTCTTATACCAATTTCTATT-3′; LRP1B 172, 5-TTTCATGGATCCGAAAGGCCAGCCCCAAAGAGCAGC-3′ and 5′-TTTCATCTCGAGTTATGCCAC TGTCTCTCTTATACCAATTTCTATT-3′. Constructs contained the signal peptide of LRP and an HA epitope fused to the N terminus of the expressed protein. In the case of LRP1B ICD, the PCR fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of pcDNA3 cloning vector (Invitrogen) with a neomycin-resistant gene. For the EGFP fusion constructs, the expression vector pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) was used; for C-terminal Gal4-VP16 (GV) fusion constructs, the GV coding sequence from pPM3VP16 Gal4/VP16 expression vector (Clontech). All of the constructs were validated by DNA sequencing. Constructs for shedding mutants of mLRP1B4 were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutation kit (Stratagene). For constructs of deletion mutants, PCR amplification and blunt end ligation were used without introduction of unexpected sequences into the coding sequences. All the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing after subcloning. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293, COS1, H4, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and furin-deficient CHO cell lines (a kind gift from Dr. Toni Antalis) were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All of the transient transfections of these cells with the indicated vector plasmids were performed with transfection reagent FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's procedure. Reporter Gene Assay—Cells grown overnight in 6-well plates were co-transfected with GV-fused protein expression constructs (0.5 μg), luciferase reporter plasmid pFR-Luc (0.5 μg) (Stratagene), and pCMV-LacZ expression vector (0.05 μg). pFR-Luc contains 5× upstream activation sequence Gal4 binding sites immediately upstream of the TATA box promoter, and the firefly luciferase open reading frame is driven by this promoter. pCMV-LacZ served as an internal control to normalize for transfection efficiency. Luciferase activity assay was performed on the cell lysates 24 h after transfection using the luciferase assay kit from Clontech. β-Galactosidase activity of the same lysates were assayed using Galacto-Light Plus chemiluminescent reporter assay purchased from Clontech. Normalized luciferase activity was obtained by dividing the relative light unit value of luciferase assay by the β-galactosidase value from the same lysate. To study the effect of γ-secretase inhibitor L485,658 on cleavage processing, the inhibitor was applied to the cells 16 h after transfection, and the reporter gene assays were performed 24 h after the treatment. All transfections for reporter gene assays were done in triplicate and repeated in at least three independent experiments. Antibodies, Cell Extract Preparation, and Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared using modified radioimmune precipitation cell lysate buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitors). Precast 10-20% Tricine or 4-20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) were used for Western blotting analysis. Mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against HA epitope were purchased from Sigma and Santa Cruz biotechnology. Rabbit anti-VP16 IgG was purchased from Clontech. Rabbit 489 polyclonal antibodies against C terminus LRP1B (intra cellular domain) was raised using a synthetic oligopeptide representing the C-terminal sequence of LRP1B (ELLPKKIEIGIRETVA). To analyze the soluble mLRP1B4 in the condition medium, cells transfected with wild type and mutant LRP1B constructs were cultured in advance Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 0.5% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Collected condition medium was concentrated using Centrprep 30 (Millipore). To the concentrated samples, an equal volume of 2× Nonidet P-40 cell lysis buffer was added and immunoprecipitated with 4 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibodies (Santa Cruz). Immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with monoclonal anti HA antibodies (Santa Cruz). Florescence Microscopy Analysis—H4 cells grown on cover-slips in 6-well plates were transiently transfected with the EGFP fusion constructs. 36 h after transfection the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0. The fluorescence analysis was performed using a Nikon ECLIPSE E800 microscope. Anchorage-independent Growth by Soft Agar Assay—The cell transformation detection assay kit from Chemicon International was used following the recommended procedure. Neuroglioma H4 cells were grown overnight in 150-cm culture dishes and transfected with (10 μg/plate) WT and mutant LRP1B constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). 72 h after transfection cells were selected in the presence of 600 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. Cell surface expression of LRP1B containing the transmembrane domain in these cells was analyzed by flow cytometry using a monoclonal anti-HA IgG (Sigma). After confirming the cell surface expression, 2.5 × 103 cells per well were mixed with the 0.4% top agar in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum and applied to the 0.8% base agar made with DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and grown for 18 days at 37 °C. After incubation, colonies were counted by size for transfectants of each indicated construct. LRP1B Is Cleaved by an γ-Secretase-like Activity—To systematically examine if LRP1B undergoes RIP we developed a set of plasmids capable of expressing different forms of LRP1B (Fig. 1). One expression plasmid encodes for a minireceptor, termed mLRP1B4, which contains the light chain of LRP1B along with the fourth cluster of ligand binding repeats that has been previously demonstrated to bind and endocytose ligands (8Liu C.X. Li Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Additional expression plasmids were generated that contain deletion mutants of mLRP1B4 and include LRP1B 425, a 425-amino acid-containing protein that includes 6 EGF repeats of the LRP1B light chain, the transmembrane domain, and the entire ICD. LRP1B 172 represents a receptor in which most of the ectodomain is deleted and is similar to the mNotch mutant described (41Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). As a control for our experiments, we also expressed the LRP1B ICD. LRP1B differs from LRP1 in the inclusion of an alternatively spliced exon 90 insertion within its ICD, and thus, in addition to these constructs, we also prepared LRP1B 172Δ in which the inserted sequence encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 90 was deleted from LRP1B 172. To assess cleavage analysis, a sensitive reporter gene assay was employed in which the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain and a VP16 transactivation domain from herpes simplex virus was fused to the C-terminal end of the cytoplasmic tail as described previously (38May P. Reddy Y.K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18736-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were transfected with the LRP1B plasmids, and LRP1B ICD cleavage was assessed by measuring luciferase activity, which is only expressed when the Gal4-VP16-fused LRP1B ICD is released from membrane tethering by proteolysis. The results (Fig. 2A) demonstrate that expression of LRP1B 425-GV, LRP1B 172-GV, and LRP1B 172Δ-GV all resulted in the generation of luciferase activity and the latter two at a level very close to that of the positive controls (LRP1B ICD-GV and GV). The data also showed that the alternative spliced form of LRP1B in which the sequence encoded by exon 90 was deleted (LRP1B 172Δ) was also cleaved as efficiently as wild type LRP1B 172-GV, revealing that both forms of the receptor undergo similar proteolytic processing, and that the cleavage site is not located within the sequence encoded by exon 90. To determine whether the cleavage was mediated by γ-secretase-like activity, the specific γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 was used. HEK 293 cells were transfected with LRP1B 172-GV plasmid and then treated with increasing concentrations of the γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458. After treatment, the luciferase activity was measured, and the results (Fig. 2B) show that the reporter gene activity generated from cleavage of LRP1B 172-GV was inhibited by L-685,458 in a dose-dependent manner, similar to the results obtained for the APP fused to the GV domains which served as a positive control in this experiment. These results suggest that the release of the GV-fused intracellular domain is mediated by γ-secretase cleavage. Similar results were obtained using H4 human neuroglioma cell lines (data not shown). Interestingly, the reporter gene activity from cells transfected with LRP1B 425-GV was consistently much lower than that of LRP1B 172-GV. These results were not due to higher protein expression by the shorter forms, as immunoblotting of cell extracts using anti-HA epitope located at the N-terminal portion of the expressed protein (Fig. 2C) or an antibody that recognizes the VP16-domain located at the C terminus (Fig. 2D) revealed that LRP1B 425-GV was expressed at equal or even higher levels than LRP1B 172-GV in the transfected cells. This difference in reporter gene activity between these two minireceptors suggests that LRP1B 172-GV is a direct substrate of γ-secretase, whereas LRP1B 425-GV may require an extra step of ectodomain shedding to generate the γ-secretase substrate. Finally, although the LRP1B ICD gave a signal in the luciferase assay, the ICD was not easily detected by immunoblot analysis, suggesting that it is rapidly degraded. The Putative γ-Secretase Substrate is a 21-kDa C-terminal Fragment Generated from LRP1B Ectodomain Shedding—To determine whether we could detect cleavage products of LRP1B, we next investigated the processing of mLRP1B4, LRP1B 425, and LRP1B 172 in the presence of γ-secretase inhibitors by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against the HA tag located at the N-terminal region of the receptor (Fig. 3B) as well as antibodies prepared against the C-terminal region of LRP1B (Fig. 3C). Cells transfected with mLRP1B4 constructs express the ∼160-kDa band of the unprocessed mLRP1B4 protein (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). A 96-kDa furin processed LRP1B light chain is detected when the extracts are immunoblotted with a C-terminal antibody (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 2). In the case of LRP1B 172, the expected 26-kDa polypeptide representing the mature form of this truncated receptor was detected (Fig. 3B, lane 3), whereas in the case of LRP1B 425, a 74-kDa polypeptide representing the intact protein was detected (Fig. 3B, lane 5). When the same immunoblots were probed with a C-terminal antibody, a 21-kDa band was observed to accumulate in the presence of L-685,458 (Fig. 3C, arrow, lanes 2, 4, and 6). Because this band accumulates only when γ-secretase inhibitor is present, we hypothesize that this 21-kDa band represents a substrate for γ-secretase that arises from shedding of the LRP1B ectodomain. Together with the reporter gene assay results, the data suggest that the LRP1B ICD is proteolytically released by a γ-secretase like activity. We also noted that the band density of unprocessed LRP1B-172 was dramatically increased in the presence of γ-secretase inhibitor (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that LRP1B 172 itself may be a direct substrate of γ-secretase, similar to the findings for truncated forms of Notch (41Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 43Shah S. Lee S.F. Tabuchi K. Hao Y.H. Yu C. LaPlant Q. Ball H. Dann III, C.E. Sudhof T. Yu G. Cell. 2005; 122: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The Ectodomain of LRP1B Is Shed by a Metalloproteinase—To identify the class of proteinase required for proteolytic processing of LRP1B, we examined the effect of various proteinase inhibitors on the generation of the 21-kDa γ-secretase substrate. When the cells were preincubated with TAPI-2, an inhibitor of ADAM 17 (TACE), we noticed a decrease in the levels of the 21-kDa fragment (Fig. 4) in the presence of the γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458. These results suggest that ectodomain shedding by ADAM 17 or a related proteinase is necessary to generate the 21-kDa γ-secretase substrate. Consistent with these results, we found that the general metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 also reduced the generation of the 21-kDa fragment. We also examined if inhibitors of other classes of proteinases could inhibit the generation of the 21-kDa C-terminal fragment. We found that the general serine proteinase inhibitor AEBSF reduced the amount of the 21-kDa fragment, suggesting an effect of serine proteinases on LRP1B proteolytic processing. Because AEBSF is known to inhibit furin, which activates ADAM17 by processing of the pro-domain, this is the most likely explanation for its effect on LRP1B shedding. Mutational Analysis Identifies Candidate Ectodomain Shedding Sites on LRP1B—Because LRP1B 172 contains a relatively small ectodomain and is processed to generate the 21-kDa membrane-bound fragment (see Fig. 3C, lane 4), the proteolytic cleavage site resulting in shedding of the ectodomain must be relatively close to the transmembrane domain. In LRP1B a stretch of amino acids linking the transmembrane domain with the first EGF repeat contains a number of basic residues ("
https://openalex.org/W2067944477,"Anandamide (AEA) is a lipid molecule belonging to the family of endocannabinoids. Various studies report neuroprotective activity of AEA against toxic insults, such as ischemic conditions and excitotoxicity, whereas some show that AEA has pro-apoptotic effects. Here we have shown that AEA confers a protective activity in N18TG2 murine neuroblastoma cells subjected to low serum-induced apoptosis. We have demonstrated that the protection from apoptosis by AEA is not mediated via the CB1 receptor, the CB2 receptor, or the vanilloid receptor 1. Interestingly, breakdown of AEA by fatty acid amide hydrolase is required for the protective effect of AEA. Furthermore, the ethanolamine (EA) generated in this reaction is the metabolite responsible for the protective response. The elevation in the levels of reactive oxygen species during low serum-induced apoptosis is not affected by AEA or EA. On the other hand, AEA and EA reduce caspase 3/7 activity, and AEA attenuates the cleavage of PARP-1. Taken together, our results demonstrate a role for AEA and EA in the protection against low serum-induced apoptosis. Anandamide (AEA) is a lipid molecule belonging to the family of endocannabinoids.

A wide range of physiological functions of endocannabinoids was discovered in recent years. It appears that the endocannabinoids play crucial roles in the central and autonomous nervous system, the reproductive system, the cardiovascular system, the gastrointestinal tract, and in microcirculation (1Di Marzo V. Bifulco M. De Petrocellis L. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 771-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar).The endocannabinoids, as well as plant-derived and synthetic cannabinoids, were shown to activate two distinct G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors, the CB1 receptor, which is present at high concentrations in the nervous system, and the CB2 receptor, which is located primarily in immune cells (2Howlett A.C. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2005; 168: 53-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The endocannabinoid AEA is also capable of activating the vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1) (3Smart D. Gunthorpe M.J. Jerman J.C. Nasir S. Gray J. Muir A.I. Chambers J.K. Randall A.D. Davis J.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). However, both cannabinoids and endocannabinoids were found to affect various physiological functions by mechanisms that are not dependent upon the receptor subtypes with which they are known to interact.Evidence has accumulated in recent years in support of involvement of cannabinoids in the modulation of cell fate-related processes, such as proliferation, death, and differentiation (4Maccarrone M. Finazzi-Agro A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 5Guzman M. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2005; 168: 627-642Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Lopez-Rodriguez M.L. Viso A. Ortega-Gutierrez S. Diaz-Laviada I. Mini. Rev. Med. Chem. 2005; 5: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Some studies report protective activity of the endocannabinoid AEA against apoptosis, whereas others describe AEA as an apoptosis inducer (4Maccarrone M. Finazzi-Agro A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). AEA was shown to induce apoptosis in cell lines from different origins, including neuronal cells (7Guzman M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Pro-apoptotic activity of AEA was documented in primary neurons, in PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells, and in CHP-100 neuroblastoma cells (8Maccarrone M. Lorenzon T. Bari M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agro A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31938-31945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 9Movsesyan V.A. Stoica B.A. Yakovlev A.G. Knoblach S.M. Lea P.M. Cernak I. Vink R. Faden A.I.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). On the other hand, neuroprotective activities of AEA have been implicated in various pathological conditions. For example, AEA protects cultured cerebral cortical neurons from the effects of a combination of hypoxia and glucose deprivation, conditions serving as an in vitro model of ischemia (11Sinor A.D. Irvin S.M. Greenberg D.A. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 278: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and Milton has demonstrated inhibition of β-amyloid toxicity by AEA, claiming a protective role in Alzheimer disease (12Milton N.G. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 332: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Interestingly, elevated levels of AEA were reported to accompany both neuronal apoptotic and necrotic cell death (13Hansen H.H. Ikonomidou C. Bittigau P. Hansen S.H. Hansen H.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, AEA levels were up-regulated in the hippocampus following glutamate excitotoxicity (14Marsicano G. Goodenough S. Monory K. Hermann H. Eder M. Cannich A. Azad S.C. Cascio M.G. Gutierrez S.O. van der Stelt M. Lopez-Rodriguez M.L. Casanova E. Schutz G. Zieglgansberger W. Di Marzo V. Behl C. Lutz B. Science. 2003; 302: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar), in models of Alzheimer and Parkinson disease (1Di Marzo V. Bifulco M. De Petrocellis L. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 771-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), and in focal cerebral ischemia (15Muthian S. Rademacher D.J. Roelke C.T. Gross G.J. Hillard C.J. Neuroscience. 2004; 129: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). At this stage, it is not clear whether the increase in AEA levels under these conditions could point to a protective effect of AEA or whether it might be part of the mechanism causing the pathological manifestation and/or its consequences.The mechanisms underlying the involvement of AEA in apoptosis or neuroprotection are not yet understood. The VR1 receptor was reported as a regulator of AEA-induced apoptosis in human cervix cancer cells as well as in human glioma and endothelial cells (16Contassot E. Tenan M. Schnuriger V. Pelte M.F.

Maruyama I. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 89: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in human cervix cancer and glioma cells, the pro-apoptotic effect of AEA via VR1 was coupled with a protective effect of AEA via the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 (16Contassot E. Tenan M. Schnuriger V. Pelte M.F. Dietrich P.Y. Gynecol. Oncol. 2004; 93: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Contassot E. Wilmotte R. Tenan M. Belkouch M.C. Schnuriger V. de Tribolet N. Burkhardt K. Dietrich P.Y. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 63: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Neuroprotection by AEA has been mainly attributed to CB1 receptor-mediated signaling. However, in some studies, the neuroprotective response to AEA was neither CB1 nor CB2 receptor-dependent (19Jackson S.J. Diemel L.T. Pryce G. Baker D. J. Neurol. Sci. 2005; 233: 21-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).In this report, we have examined the effect of AEA on low serum-induced apoptosis. Using N18TG2 murine neuroblastoma, a cell line known to contain high levels of the CB1 receptor (2Howlett A.C. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2005; 168: 53-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Abood M.E. Ditto K.E. Noel M.A. Showalter V.M. Tao Q. Biochem.

Brain Res. 1998; 53: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we have shown that AEA reverses the low serum-induced apoptosis and that this effect is not mediated via the CB1 receptor. AEA is degraded in the cells by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) to arachidonic acid (AA) and ethanolamine (EA) (22Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). We found that the degradation of AEA by FAAH is a step required for AEA-protective activity and that EA is the degradation product that mediates the protection from low serum-induced apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The N18TG2 cell line was grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The cells were transferred to Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 0.2% FCS for 24–48 h as detailed below.Chemicals and Antibodies—Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium was obtained from Invitrogen. Trypsin/EDTA was purchased from Biological Industries Ltd. (Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel). AEA was a kind gift from Prof. R. Mechoulam (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel). SR141716, a CB1 receptor antagonist, and SR144528, a CB2 receptor antagonist, were from RTI International (Research Triangle Park, NC). Propidium iodide (PI), AA, EA, N-mono methylethanolamine (MEA), N,N′-dimethylethanolamine (DEA), DNase-free RNase A, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), Hoechst 33342, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) were from Sigma. Capsazepine, a VR1 receptor antagonist, was from Tocris Cookson (Bristol, UK). URB597, an inhibitor of FAAH, was a generous gift from Dr. D. Piomelli (University of California, Irvine, CA). Stock solutions of AEA, SR141716, SR144528, AA, EA, MEA, and DEA were prepared in ethanol, and aliquots were stored at –80 °C. For experiments, alcoholic solutions were diluted in fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin as described previously (23Bayewitch M. Rhee M.H. Avidor-Reiss T. Breuer A. Mechoulam R. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9902-9905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Capsazepine and URB597 were prepared in Me2SO and diluted for experiments in PBS. The mouse monoclonal anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) antibody and the mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody were gifts from Profs. Y. Zick and I. Ginzburg (Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel), respectively.Hoechst Staining—Cultured cells were washed twice in PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS, incubated with PBS containing 6 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Cell nuclei were observed by fluorescence microscopy and photographed using an OLYMPUS IX81 microscope.Detection of Apoptotic DNA Fragmentation—DNA was extracted using the Apoptotic DNA Ladder Detection Kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) using their recommended protocol. Briefly, equal numbers of cells were seeded in culture dishes, and apoptosis was induced by low serum treatment for 48 h. The cells were counted, pelleted by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and lysed with Tris-EDTA lysis buffer by gentle pipetting. Lysates were then incubated with DNase-free RNase A at 37 °C for 10 min and with proteinase K at 50 °C for 30 min. Intact and fragmented DNA was precipitated by the addition of ammonium acetate solution and isopropyl alcohol at –20 °C. The DNA pellet was washed with ice-cold 70% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in DNA loading Buffer. DNA was then subjected to electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized by transillumination with UV light.FACS Analysis of Apoptosis—Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol-30% HBSS and stored at –20 °C. Cells were then washed once with HBSS, resuspended in HBSS containing 0.2 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. This RNase treatment was used to prevent PI binding to double-stranded RNA. Cells were then washed with HBSS and resuspended in HBSS containing 50 μg/ml PI. Cells were analyzed by FACS using the FACSort flow cytometer (excitation at a wavelength of 488 nm and emission at 600 nm) and the CellQuest list mode analysis software (BD Biosciences).Detection of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species—Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by flow cytometry using the cell-permeable ROS-specific dye DCFH-DA. This compound diffuses into the cell where it is cleaved by intracellular esterases to yield DCFH, which is trapped within the cell. This nonfluorescent molecule is then oxidized by low molecular weight peroxides to the fluorescent compound dichlorofluorescein. Therefore, the fluorescence intensity measured reflects the amount of ROS present in the cells (24Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar). Following the different treatments, cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 5 μm DCFH-DA in the appropriate medium for each treatment (10 or 0.2% FCS). The cells were then washed once with PBS and analyzed by FACS using the FACSort flow cytometer (excitation at a wavelength of 488 nm and emission at 525 nm) and the CellQuest list mode analysis software.Caspase 3/7 Assay—Caspase 3/7 activity was determined by the Apo-ONE™ homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). This assay is based on the cleavage of the substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-rhodamine 110 by caspases 3 or 7 and the analysis of the amount of fluorescent rhodamine liberated. Briefly, following treatment, the cells were harvested, and equal numbers of cells (1 × 105) were resuspended in 50 μl of medium (containing either 10 or 0.2% FCS, according to the treatment before harvesting) and loaded into each well of a black 96-well plate. Lysis buffer and the substrate (benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-rhodamine 110) were added to the cells and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The amount of rhodamine 110-leaving group was determined by excitation at 499 nm and measuring the emission at 521 nm. The amount of fluorescent product generated is proportional to the amount of caspase-3/7 cleavage activity present in the samples.Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), and the amount of protein in each sample was normalized by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Laemmli sample buffer was then added, and the samples were boiled for 10 min and loaded on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. Following gel electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry transfer cell (BioRad) and the blots incubated with anti-PARP-1 and anti-GAPDH antibodies. The protein-antibody complexes were detected using a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and the Super-signal-enhanced chemiluminescence assay system (Pierce).Data Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.D. of three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate.

Brain Res. 1998; 53: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and from which the CB1 receptor was cloned. Apoptosis was induced in N18TG2 neuroblastoma cells by replacing the normal growth medium (containing 10% FCS) with low serum medium (containing 0.2% FCS). AEA was added, unless otherwise indicated, concomitantly with the transfer of the cells to the low serum conditions. Staining with Hoechst 33342 (Fig. 1A) revealed that 36 h in low serum-containing medium induced apoptosis of the cells, manifested in an increased number of cells with condensed nuclei. Interestingly, treatment with AEA protected the cells from low serum-induced apoptosis. To verify that the DNA condensation observed using the Hoechst staining was indeed due to apoptosis, we have analyzed chromosomal DNA fragmentation by agarose gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1B, the low serum treatment induced the formation of distinct internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, one of the hallmarks of apoptosis. On the other hand, the addition of AEA to the 0.2% FCS-containing medium significantly inhibited the DNA fragmentation. To quantify the extent of AEA-induced protection, we evaluated the percentage of cell apoptosis by FACS-based staining with PI. Using this technique, we found that, under normal growth conditions, the addition of AEA to the medium did not affect cell cycle distribution (Fig. 2A). However, when the N18TG2 cells were grown in low serum for 48 h, a large sub-G1 population was detected, indicating that a significant fraction of the cells underwent apoptosis. Interestingly, the addition of AEA to the low serum-containing medium produced a pronounced protection from apoptosis. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2A, although the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis following 48 h in 0.2% FCS-containing medium was 78.2%, the addition of 1 μm AEA to the low serum medium lowered the apoptosis percentage to 21.4%. We then found (Fig. 2B) that AEA protects the N18TG2 cells from apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner and exerts almost full inhibition of apoptosis at a concentration of 5 μm. Moreover, AEA was still capable of conferring protection even when added 6 h after the replacement of the medium to low serum-containing medium. The addition of AEA at the time of serum reduction (or 6 h later) produced a similar degree of protection (data not shown).FIGURE 1AEA protects N18TG2 cells from apoptosis induced by serum reduction. A, representative images of N18TG2 cells stained with Hoechst 33342 following 36 h in 10% FCS or in 0.2% FCS containing 5 μm AEA or vehicle.

However, there is no documentation of CB2 or VR1 expression in these cells. Because AEA is known to interact with all of these receptor types, it was of interest to examine their possible involvement in the modulation of apoptosis by AEA. To this end, we first applied the CB1-specific antagonist, SR141716, or the CB2 specific antagonist, SR144528, before the addition of AEA. As can be seen in Fig. 3A, these antagonists had no effect on cell apoptosis by themselves. Moreover, AEA elicited similar protection against apoptosis in the presence of SR141716 or SR144528 as that observed when added alone, ruling out the possible involvement of either CB1 or CB2 receptors in this process.We next investigated whether VR1 could be involved in the AEA-induced anti-apoptotic effect. Capsazepine, a VR1 antagonist, did not affect the protective activity of AEA against low serum-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 3B). Thus, the VR1 receptor is not involved in the AEA protective activity. Taken together, AEA protective effect in N18TG2 cells maintained in low serum conditions is cannabinoid and vanilloid receptor-independent.Metabolism of AEA to Ethanolamine Is a Critical Step in AEA-induced Protection—FAAH is a key enzyme in the enzymatic degradation of AEA to AA and EA (22Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar, 25Cravatt B.F. Demarest K. Patricelli M.P. Bracey M.H. Giang D.K. Martin B.R. Lichtman A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9371-9376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). We utilized the FAAH inhibitor URB597 (26Kathuria S. Gaetani S. Fegley D. Valino F. Duranti A. Tontini A. Mor M. Tarzia G. Rana G. La Calignano A. Giustino A. Tattoli M. Palmery M. Cuomo V. Piomelli D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar) to address the possible requirement of AEA degradation for AEA anti-apoptotic activity. We found that blockade of FAAH activity by pretreatment with URB597 resulted in loss of AEA-protective effect (Fig. 4). Thus, we concluded that the activity of FAAH is critical for AEA-mediated protection.In light of these observations, it was of interest to investigate which of the AEA metabolites generated by FAAH is required for the protection from apoptosis. Therefore, following the induction of apoptosis by low serum, we treated the cells with either, AEA, AA, or EA (each at 1 μm). Interestingly, the EA produced a comparable decrease in apoptosis to AEA (Fig. 5A). The AA (at 1 μm concentration) had no effect on low serum-induced apoptosis. To further confirm the differential effects of EA and AA, we conducted dose-response experiments with EA and AA. As can be seen in Fig. 5B, treatment with AA did not affect low serum-induced apoptosis at the concentration range of 0.5–2.5 μm, whereas 5 μm AA produced some protection (of 28% of the apoptotic control). On the contrary, treatment with EA caused a decrease in low serum-induced apoptosis of N18TG2 cells already at 0.5 μm, reaching a very prominent percentage of protection (∼70%) at the concentration range of 1–5 μm. These results show that the EA produced from AEA acts as the major mediator of AEA-induced protection from apoptosis in these cells and that the AA produced has a very modest effect.Several studies have demonstrated protection against apoptosis by the methylated EA analogues MEA and DEA (27Brand A. Gil S. Yavin E. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1596-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Naujokaitis S.A. Fisher J.M. Rabinovitz M. J. Pharm.

Therefore, we examined the effect of these methyl derivatives of EA on low serum-induced apoptosis. As can be seen in Fig. 6, although 5 μm AEA or EA almost fully protected the cells from apoptosis, the methyl derivatives of EA at this concentration exerted no protection.AEA and EA Do Not Reduce ROS Production—The levels of ROS are elevated during serum deprivation-induced apoptosis (30Satoh T. Sakai N. Enokido Y. Uchiyama Y. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1996; 733: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether AEA protection against apoptosis is mediated via modulation of ROS levels. The N18TG2 cells were transferred to low serum-containing medium, treated with AEA or EA, and assayed for ROS production using the DCFH-DA dye, known to be oxidized by H2O2 and low molecular weight peroxides. The amount of oxidized fluorescent dichlorofluorescein generated by this reaction was measured by flow cytometry. As can be seen in Fig. 7, ROS production was significantly increased following 6 h of incubation in low serum-containing medium. The exposure to 5 μm AEA or EA, a concentration that rescues the N18TG2 cells from apoptosis, did not affect the levels of intracellular ROS. The same result was observed when the cells were maintained in low serum for 24 h. ROS levels remained high and were not influenced by the addition of AEA or EA (data not shown). In conclusion, AEA anti-apoptotic effect is not mediated by regulation of ROS producti"
https://openalex.org/W2117004070,"Activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (phox) requires the association of cytosolic proteins (p67-phox, p47-phox, p40-phox, and Rac1/2) with the membrane cytochrome b558, leading to a hemoprotein conformation change. To clarify this mechanism, the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex was isolated through cytochrome b558 purification after three chromatographic steps. The purified neutrophil complex was constitutively active in the absence of an amphiphile agent with a maximum turnover (125 mol O2(-) x s(-1) x mol heme b(-1)), indicating that cytochrome b558 has been activated by cytosolic proteins and is in an ""open conformation,"" able to transfer a maximum rate of electrons. In contrast, the phox complex prepared with B lymphocyte cytosol shows a lower constitutive turnover (approximately 50 mol O2(-) x s(-1) x mol heme b(-1)). Analysis of phox complex components by Western blot and mass spectrometry showed the presence of cytosolic factors (especially p67-phox) and structural proteins (moesin, ezrin). To investigate the difference in activity of phox complexes, we evaluated the effect of MRP8 and MRP14, specifically expressed in neutrophils, on the activity of the B lymphocyte complex. MRPs induce the switch between the partially and the fully ""open"" cytochrome b558 conformation. Moreover, their effect was independent of p67-phox. Data point out two potential cytochrome b558 activation states."

This implies that these circulating, systemically infused cells must respond to serum-derived cues that direct their ultimate biodistribution. The molecular players regulating cellular mobilization, chemotaxis, and cell survival of BMSC have received little attention. Among the mediators known to exert potent cellular chemotactic effects, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is one of the most important bioactive lysophospholipids secreted in blood plasma either upon platelet activation (11Yatomi Y. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2006; 12: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or from brain tumor-derived glioma cells (12Van Brocklyn J.R. Jackson C.A. Pearl D.K. Kotur M.S. Snyder P.J. Prior T.W. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 64: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In fact, we have demonstrated that BMSC chemotaxis was very strong in response to S1P (13Annabi B.

Cancer Cell Int. 2006; 6: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we hypothesized whether MT1-MMP and G6PT might share some common molecular and cellular impact on the regulation of BMSC chemotaxis and ECM degradation. Since its discovery, G6PT has been shown to integrate and regulate many metabolic functions such as glycemia, lipidmia, uricemia, and lactic acidemia (20Chou J.Y. Matern D. Mansfield B.C. Chen Y.T.

Currie J.C. Desgagnes J. Annabi B. Cancer Cell Int. 2006; 6: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We decided to investigate the potential molecular and functional link that may exist between MT1-MMP and G6PT functions. Materials—SDS, bovine serum albumin (BSA), Hoechst 33258, and propidium iodine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Cell culture media was obtained from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Electrophoresis reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The ECL reagents were from Amersham Biosciences (Baie d’Urfé;, Qué;bec, Canada). Micro bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagents were from Pierce. The polyclonal antibody against MT1-MMP was from Chemicon (AB815), while the polyclonal antibody against G6PT was generated against the 5GYGYYRTVIFSAMFGGY21 peptide derived from the human G6PT primary sequence (GenBank™ accession number AAD19898) (25Chen L.Y. Pan C.J. Shieh J.J. Chou J.Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3199-3207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at the Biotechnology Research Institute (Montreal, Qué;bec, Canada). All other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich Canada. Cell Culture—BMSC were isolated from the whole femur and tibia bone marrow of either C57BL/6 female mice or from a colony of Egr-1-/- (null) C57BL/6 female mice (gift of Dr. Lorraine E. Chalifour, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research) (26Saadane N. Yue P. Alpert L. Mitmaker B. Kirby G.M. Chalifour L.E. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2001; 79: 533-544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured and characterized as described previously (14Meriane M. Duhamel S. Lejeune L. Galipeau J. Annabi B. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 2557-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Analysis by flow cytometry performed at passage 14 revealed that BMSC expressed CD44, yet were negative for CD45, CD31, KDR/flk1 (VEGF-R2), flt-4 (VEGF-R3), and Tie2 (angiopoietin receptor) (data not shown). Chemotactic Cell Migration Assay—BMSC, which had been mock-transfected or transfected with siMT1-MMP, were trypsinized and seeded at 105 cells/filter on 0.15% gelatin/PBS-precoated Transwells (Corning/Costar; Acton, MA; 8-μm pore size) assembled in 24-well Boyden chambers, which were filled with 600 μl of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented or not with 1 μm S1P or of growth factor-enriched medium isolated from serum-starved U87 glioblastoma cells in the lower compartment. Cell migration was allowed to proceed for 6 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Non-migrating cells that remained on the upper side of the Transwell filters were carefully removed with cotton swabs. Cells that had migrated to the lower side of the filters were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet, 20% MeOH and counted. The migration was quantified by analyzing at least ten random fields per filter for each independent experiment using Northern Eclipse 6.0 software (Empix Imaging Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) for computer-assisted imaging. RNA Interference—RNA interference experiments were performed using Lipofectamine 2000. A small interfering RNA against MT1-MMP (siMT1-MMP) and mismatch small interfering RNA (siRNA) were synthesized by EZBiolab Inc. (Westfield, IN) and annealed to form duplexes. The sequence of the siMT1-MMP used in this study is conserved between human (GenBank™ accession number NM_004995) and murine (GenBank™ accession number NM_008608) genes and is as follows: 5′-CCAGAAGCUGAAGGUAGAAdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-UUCUACCUUCAGCUUCUGGdTdT-3′ (antisense) (27Neth P. Ciccarella M. Egea V. Hoelters J. Jochum M. Ries C. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 1892-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Knockdown of MT1-MMP expression, as assessed by RT-PCR, ranged routinely from 75 to 90% efficiency (data not shown). Total RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cultured BMSC using TRIzol reagent. One microgram of total RNA was used for first strand cDNA synthesis followed by specific gene product amplification with the One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). Primer sequences for MT1-MMP, G6PT, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase)-β, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase have been validated and published elsewhere (19Belkaid A. Currie J.C. Desgagnes J. Annabi B. Cancer Cell Int. 2006; 6: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). PCR conditions were optimized so that the gene products were examined at the exponential phase of their amplification, and the products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Gelatin Zymography—Gelatin zymography was used to assess the extent of pro-MMP-2 activation in the culture medium as described previously (19Belkaid A. Currie J.C. Desgagnes J. Annabi B. Cancer Cell Int. 2006; 6: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Gelatinolytic activity was detected as unstained bands on a blue background. Immunoblotting Procedures—Proteins from control and treated cells were separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes which were then blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 0.3% Tween 20 (TBST). Membranes were further washed in TBST and incubated with primary antibodies (1/1,000 dilution) in TBST containing 3% bovine serum albumin, followed by a 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1/2,500 dilution) in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Immunoreactive material was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Analysis of Cell Cycle by Flow Cytometry—Distribution of BMSC throughout the cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometry (28McLaughlin N. Annabi B. Lachambre M.P. Kim K.S. Bahary J.P. Moumdjian R. Beliveau R. J. Neurooncol. 2006; 80: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Serum-fasting preparation was performed prior to analysis, and therefore the cell populations were synchronous. Cells were harvested by gentle scraping, pelleted by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold PBS/EDTA (5 mm), then resuspended in 1 volume of PBS/EDTA and fixed with 100% ethanol overnight. Three volumes of staining solution, containing propidium iodine (PI, 50 μg/ml) and DNase-free RNase (20 μg/ml), were added. The fraction of the population in each phase of the cell cycle was determined as a function of the DNA content using a BD Biosciences FACS Calibur flow cytometer equipped with CellQuest Pro software. In particular, the characteristics of cell distribution in the sub-G1 region were studied on the DNA histogram. Analysis of Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry—Cells floating in the supernatant and adherent cells were harvested by trypsin solution and gathered to produce a single cell suspension. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with PBS. Then, 2 × 105 cells were pelleted and suspended in 200 μl of buffer solution and stained with annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and PI as described by the manufacturer (BD Biosciences). The cells were diluted by adding 300 μl of buffer solution and processed for data acquisition and analysis on a BD Biosciences FACS Calibur flow cytometer using CellQuest Pro software. The x and y axes indicated the fluorescence levels of annexin-V and PI, respectively. It was possible to detect and quantitatively compare the percentages of gated populations in all of the four regions delineated. Cell death was monitored in the early stages of apoptosis (annexin-V+/PI-), in late apoptosis (annexin-V+/PI+), and in necrotic cells (annexin-V-/PI+). The percentage of apoptotic and necrotic cells was also evaluated by fluorescence microscopy using Hoechst 33258/PI cell staining (29Zhang L. Mizumoto K. Sato N. Ogawa T. Kusumato M. Niiyama H. Tanaka M. Cancer Lett. 1999; 142: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Statistical Data Analysis—Data are representative of three or more independent experiments. Statistical significance was assessed using Student’s unpaired t test and was used to compare the Ilomastat effect to vehicle-treated cells. Probability values of less than 0.05 were considered significant, and an asterisk identifies such significance in Figs. 2 and 4.FIGURE 4Induction of necrosis by MT1-MMP requires intracellular signaling through its intact intracellular domain. BMSC were transiently transfected with empty plasmid cDNA or cDNA encoding the full-length (Wt) or cytoplasmic truncated (Δ-Cyto) GFP-fused MT1-MMP. A, representative pictures showing transfection efficiency and expression of the GFP-MT1-MMP recombinant proteins. B, because of the staining with annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate, BMSC were transfected with plasmids cDNA encoding the non-GFP recombinant Wt and Δ-Cyto MT1-MMP. BMSC were then serum-starved for 18 h in the presence or absence of 10 μm Ilomastat and conditioned medium harvested to assess pro-MMP-2 activation using gelatin zymography. C and D, cell death was then assessed in transfected BMSC and quantified in the presence (black bars) or absence (white bars) (D) of Ilomastat through staining with annexin-V and propidium iodine as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MT1-MMP-mediated Activation of Latent Pro-MMP-2 by Concanavalin A Correlates with a Decrease in G0/G1 and an Increase in Sub-G1 Cell Cycle Phases—Lectins such as concanavalin A (ConA) and wheat germ agglutinin are known to regulate MT1-MMP-mediated pro-MMP-2 and to induce cell death (30Kim M. Rao M.V. Tweardy D.J. Prakash M. Galili U. Gorelik E. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 31Gervasi D.C. Raz A. Dehem M. Yang M. Kurkinen M. Fridman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ConA, in particular, is further well documented to promote MT1-MMP trafficking from a storage pool to the cell surface (32Zucker S. Hymowitz M. Conner C.E. DiYanni E.A. Cao J. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 1673-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and is, thus, routinely used to assess the MT1-MMP-mediated processes involved in pro-MMP-2 activation (13Annabi B. Thibeault S. Lee Y.T. Bousquet-Gagnon N. Eliopoulos N. Barrette S. Galipeau J. Beliveau R. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 640-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Gingras D. Page M. Annabi B. Beliveau R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1497: 341-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A dose-response to ConA was performed in BMSC, and pro-MMP-2 activation was assessed by zymography. Latent pro-MMP-2 was increasingly processed to its active MMP-2 form (Fig. 1A) and, concomitantly, MT1-MMP proteolytic processing to its inactive 43-kDa form was also induced (Fig. 1B). Furin inhibition with the synthetic furin inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone confirmed the nature of the active MT1-MMP build-up (data not shown) as reported previously (33Zucker S. Hymowitz M. Conner C. DeClerck Y. Cao J. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because pro-MMP-2 activation is thought to interfere with cell survival and proliferation (34Hinoue A. Takigawa T. Miura T. Nishimura Y. Suzuki S. Shiota K. Anat. Rec. A Discov. Mol. Cell. Evol. Biol. 2005; 282: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 35Preaux A.M. D'ortho M.P. Bralet M.P. Laperche Y. Mavier P. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we also sought to investigate the effect of ConA on BMSC cell cycle progression. Cells were treated with various doses of ConA, staining was performed with PI, and flow cytometry was used to assess the proportion of cells found in the G0/G1,S,G2/M, and sub-G1 cell cycle phases (Fig. 1C). ConA induced a dose-dependent decrease in G0/G1 that was concomitantly observed with an increase in sub-G1 (Fig. 1D). While the S and G2/M cell cycle phases remained unaffected, these observations suggest that ConA triggers some cell death process. Ilomastat Inhibits Concanavalin A-induced Pro-MMP-2 Activation and Cell Necrosis/Late Apoptosis—In light of our previous observation that ConA potentially decreased BMSC survival, we next assessed whether cell apoptosis or necrosis was involved. First, cells were treated (or not) with ConA in the presence or absence of Ilomastat, a broad range MMP inhibitor. Gelatin zymography shows that Ilomastat efficiently inhibited both pro-MMP-2 activation and MT1-MMP proteolytic activation by ConA (Fig. 2A). Apoptosis as revealed by Hoechst staining was not changed between all the conditions tested (Fig. 2B, lower blue panels). In contrast, necrosis/late apoptosis staining of the cells with PI showed increased cell death in ConA-treated cells, which was significantly reduced in the presence of Ilomastat (Fig. 2B, middle green panels). When cell death was assessed through annexin-V/PI staining and analyzed by flow cytometry, we observed that only cell necrosis (Fig. 2C, open circles) was induced by ConA treatment, while cell apoptosis was unaffected (Fig. 2C, open triangles). Interestingly, only partial inhibition (∼65%) by Ilomastat was observed when cells were treated with both ConA and Ilomastat (Fig. 2C, closed circles), while the combined treatment did not affect cell apoptosis (Fig. 2C, closed triangles). The differential inhibitory efficacies of Ilomastat on pro-MMP-2 activation and cell necrosis/late apoptosis suggests that inhibiting the catalytic function of cell surface MT1-MMP is not sufficient to completely inhibit ConA-induced cell necrosis/late apoptosis. Gene Silencing of MT1-MMP Diminishes Concanavalin A Ability to Induce Cell Necrosis/Late Apoptosis—To further investigate the role of MT1-MMP in ConA-mediated activation of pro-MMP-2 and in cell necrosis/late apoptosis, we specifically down-regulated MT1-MMP gene expression using siRNA or isolated BMSC from early growth response-1-deficient (Egr-1-/-) mice, Egr-1 being the transcription factor that tightly regulates MT1-MMP gene expression. Egr-1 protein expression in BMSC was validated (36Annabi B. Lee Y.T. Turcotte S. Naud E. Desrosiers R.R. Champagne M. Eliopoulos N. Galipeau J. Beliveau R. Stem Cells. 2003; 21: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and cells assumed to have two normal alleles of Egr-1 wild type (Wt) (Egr-1+/+) gene. These were either transfected with scrambled nucleotide siRNA or with siMT1-MMP and compared with BMSC isolated from Egr-1-/- mice. Upon treatment with ConA, pro-MMP-2 was significantly activated in Egr-1 Wt BMSC, while a significant reduction in pro-MMP-2 activation was noticed in Egr-1-/- BMSC and in BMSC in which MT1-MMP expression was silenced (Fig. 3A). When these same sets of cells were assessed for ConA-induced cell death, ConA was unable to trigger cell necrosis in siMT1-MMP-transfected cells and in Egr-1-/- BMSC (Fig. 3B). Next, total RNA was isolated from cells under the same conditions and assessed for G6PT and MT1-MMP gene expression. We observed that ConA, as expected, induced MT1-MMP gene expression in mock and still was able to induce the remaining low endogenous MT1-MMP gene expression in siMT1-MMP-transfected cells (Fig. 3C). However, while ConA down-regulated glucose 6-phosphate transporter (G6PT) gene expression in mock-transfected cells, it had no inhibitory effect on the G6PT mRNA level in BMSC transfected with siMT1-MMP or isolated from Egr-1-/- BMSC (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that MT1-MMP and its transcription factor regulator Egr-1 are required in the G6PT gene expression regulation. Induction of Cell Death by MT1-MMP Requires an Intact Intracellular Domain—To test the hypothesis that alternate domains in MT1-MMP are involved in signaling cell death in BMSC, we transiently transfected cells with cDNAs encoding recombinant forms of a GFP-fused, full-length Wt MT1-MMP as well as of a GFP-fused cytoplasmic-truncated MT1-MMP (Δ-Cyto) (37Cao J. Chiarelli C. Kozarekar P. Adler H.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 93: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the recombinant fluorescent forms of MT1-MMP confirmed that BMSC are efficiently transfectable (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, when annexin-V/PI staining of the cells was performed, a significant (∼8.5-fold increase) proportion of the cells overexpressing the Wt MT1-MMP shifted into necrosis, while overexpression of the Δ-Cyto MT1-MMP only partially (∼3-fold increase) triggered cells into necrosis (Fig. 4B). Functionality of the membrane-bound, recombinant MT1-MMP forms was also confirmed by their capacity to activate latent pro-MMP-2 into MMP-2 as shown by gelatin zymography, and this catalytic function was inhibited by Ilomastat (Fig. 4C). Notably, when cell necrosis was assessed in the MT1-MMP transfected cells, Ilomastat, as it did in ConA-treated cells, partially inhibited the Wt MT1-MMP-induced cell death and completely antagonized the slig"
https://openalex.org/W2109597306,"Angiogenesis is a feature of chronic lung diseases such as asthma and pulmonary fibrosis; however, the pathways controlling pathological angiogenesis during lung disease are not completely understood. Adenosine is a signaling molecule that has been implicated in the exacerbation of chronic lung disease and in the regulation of angiogenesis; however, the relationship between these factors has not been investigated. The current study utilized adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficient mice to determine whether chronic elevations in adenosine in vivo result in pulmonary angiogenesis. Results demonstrate substantial angiogenesis in the tracheas of ADA-deficient mice in association with adenosine elevations. ADA replacement enzyme therapy resulted in a lowering of adenosine levels and reversal of tracheal angiogenesis, indicating that the increases in vessel number are dependent on adenosine elevations. Levels of the angiogenic chemokine CXCL1 (mouse functional homologue of human IL-8) were found to be elevated in an adenosine-dependent manner in the lungs of ADA-deficient mice. Neutralization of CXCL1 and its receptor, CXCR2, resulted in the inhibition of angiogenic activity, which suggests that CXCL1 signaling through the CXCR2 receptor mediated the observed increases in angiogenesis. Our findings suggest that adenosine plays an important role, via CXCL1, in the induction of pulmonary angiogenesis."

NOS is known to catalyze more than one reaction: the NO-producing reaction is considered to be the coupled reaction, and the uncoupled reactions are those that produce reactive (reduced) oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide anion (O¯·2) and/or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). As an oxygenase, NOS has been known for more than two decades, yet there is no complete description of oxygen stoichiometry. The present paper is focused on oxygen stoichiometry and the effects of cofactor binding on the neuronal isoform (nNOS) on oxygen uptake and product formation. Products of the uncoupled reactions are analyzed using diacetyldeuteroheme-substituted horseradish peroxidase as a trapping agent for both O¯·2 and H2O2. The addition of calmodulin not only stimulated the oxygen uptake rate but also changed the product of the uncoupled reaction, supporting the possibility of two different sites for electron leakage to molecular oxygen. Quantitative analysis of the uncoupled (substrate-free) reaction revealed a stoichiometry close to the theoretical value, and adding l-arginine not only initiates the coupled reaction, but also inhibits oxygen uptake.

Structurally, all NOS isoforms have an N-terminal heme or oxygenase domain and a C-terminal flavin or reductase domain connected by a calmodulin binding region (1Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E.

These enzymes catalyze the conversion of l-arginine to nitric oxide (NO) and l-citrulline through a series of two monooxygenase reactions (3Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev.

Electron flow commences upon the oxidation of NADPH, and electrons pass through FAD to FMN. Upon binding of Ca2+/calmodulin, electrons are passed from the reductase domain to the heme domain where NO is formed. NO plays an important role in both physiological and pathological processes (5Snyder S.H. Bredt D.S. Trends Pharmacol.

To form NO, oxygen must bind to the heme of NOS, where it is subsequently activated and split; one atom of oxygen is inserted into the substrate and one combines with two protons to form H2O. This reaction is said to be “coupled” when all the electrons from NADPH are utilized in the formation of monooxygenated product and H2O. In an “uncoupled” reaction, electrons leak to O2, producing superoxide anion and other reactive oxygen species (ROS). Fully coupled NO production (3Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev.

Arginine + 2O2 + 3/2(NADPH + H+) → NO + citrulline + 3/2 NADP+ + 2 H2O Reaction 1 This reaction is a two-step monooxygenation reaction that involves Nω-hydroxy-l-arginine (NOHA) as a tightly bound intermediate. First step of the reaction is as follows. Arginine + O2 + NADPH + H+ → NOHA + H2O + NADP+ Reaction 2 The second step of the reaction is shown as Reaction 3. NOHA + O2 + ½ (NADPH + H+ → NO + L-citrulline + H2O + ½ NADP+ Reaction 3 When NOS is fully coupled with its substrate l-arginine, the theoretical value of [O2]/[NADPH] = 2/1.5 = 1.33. The uneven number means not only NADPH, but also l-arginine is oxidized by molecular oxygen. When NOHA is added as substrate, the theoretical value becomes [O2]/[NADPH] = 1/½ = 2.0. In practice, the rate of NADPH consumption is generally faster than that of proportional NO formation. Explanations of this phenomena include the uncoupled reaction (10Pou S. Keaton L. Surichamorn W.

Theoretically, the uncoupled reaction can be described as Reactions 4 and 5, 2 O2 + NADPH + H+ → 2 O¯middot;2 + NADP+ 2 H+ Reaction 4 O2 + NADPH + H+ → H2O2 + NADP+ Reaction 5 for the single electron reduction (superoxide) and 2-electron reduction (hydrogen peroxide), respectively. Taking into account the spontaneous dismutation of O¯·2 to H2O2 (k = ∼2 × 105 m–1 s–1 at pH 7.4), and the catalase activity of NOS, even the uncoupled reactions generate a complex mixture in which determination of stoichiometry is difficult. When l-arginine or NOHA is added, the reactions become even more complicated. NO, the product of the coupled reaction, can react with O¯·2, one product of the uncoupled reaction, to form peroxynitrite (ONOO–) (24Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P.

To simplify the system and obtain meaningful stoichiometry, excessive amounts of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase may be added to scavenge O¯·2 and H2O2. Upon addition of SOD, O¯·2 is converted to H2O2 and oxygen (32Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). 2 O¯·2 + 2 H+ → H2O2 + O2 Reaction 6 The enzyme catalase further breaks down H2O2 to water and oxygen. 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O2 + O2 Reaction 7 In a system that contains sufficient amounts of SOD and catalase, oxygen in the uncoupled reaction is fully reduced to water (33Reif A. Shutenko Z.V. Feelisch M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 988-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Regardless of whether O¯·2 and/or H2O2 is the initial product, the overall reaction will be as shown. O2 + 2 NADPH + 2 H+ → 2 H2O + 2 NADP+ Reaction 8 From the reactions above, we calculate the theoretical value of [O2]/[O¯·2] to be 1/1 when O¯·2 is the initial product of the uncoupled reaction; and uncoupled [O2]/[NADPH] = 1/2 in the presence of SOD and catalase. Diacetyldeuteroheme-substituted horseradish peroxidase, or dHRP, is an artificial trapping agent used by Ishimura’s group (34Nakamura Y. Ohtaki S. Makino R. Tanaka T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol.

Use of dHRP to determine ROS formed by NADPH-consuming enzymes has been limited due to interference by high concentrations of NADPH (36Desandro V. Dupuy C. Kaniewski J. Ohayon R. Deme D. Virion A.

In the present study, we used dHRP with an NADPH regeneration system, consisting of cytosolic NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDP-2) (38Cunningham M.A. Bash P.A. Biophys.

Another advantage of the regeneration system is to keep NADP+ “feedback inhibition” negligible. According to structural studies, arginine and oxygen bind in close proximity in the oxygenase domain of NOS (40Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C.Q. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A.

We, therefore, attempted to compare the Km values for oxygen in both coupled and uncoupled reactions.

The presently accepted function of BH4 is to act as a one-electron donor during reductive activation of the oxyferrous complex of the heme. Although there are many publications about the roles of BH4, there is no report of its effect on the Km of oxygen with NOS. In this study we report a decreased apparent Km value for oxygen when both arginine and BH4 are absent. Chemicals—NADPH was purchased from Alexis (San Diego, CA). Tetrahydrobiopterin was from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Fe(III) 2,4-diacetyl deuteroporphyrin IX chloride was purchased from Porphyrin. Trizma base (Tris base), l-arginine, cytochrome c (horse heart), K3Fe(CN)6, dl-isocitric acid trisodium salt, and other commercial chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Enzymes—nNOS was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described by Roman et al. (54Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martásek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The enzyme preparation was concentrated to 50 μm after being purified using the 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B column, and then dialyzed to remove 2′-AMP, arginine, and BH4. IDP-2 was prepared as described by Ding et al. (38Cunningham M.A. Bash P.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: A133-A134Google Scholar, 39Xu X. Zhao J.Y. Xu Z. Peng B.Z. Huang Q.H. Arnold E. Ding J.P. J. Biol.

The His-tagged protein was purified from a nickel column and concentrated to 8 mg/ml. Activity was tested by monitoring NADPH formation at 340 nm. Purified IDP-2 has stoichiometric NADP+ bound. dHRP was prepared using the method described by Makino et al. (35Makino R. Tanaka T. Iizuka T. Ishimura Y. Kanegasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11444-11447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Makino R. Yamazaki I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1972; 72: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Native HRP was bought from Toyobo Inc. (Japan). SOD and catalase were purchased from Sigma. dHRP Experiments—dHRP trapping of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide was monitored by an Agilent 8453 diode array UV-visible spectrophotometer. The standard reaction buffer consists of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 200 μm CaCl2, and 50 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. The reaction was carried out in a glass cuvette and measurements were taken every 10 s. A typical reaction mixture contained the standard reaction buffer and 100 μm dHRP, 200 μm MgCl2, 0.65 μm nNOS (BH4- and arginine-free), 2 μm IDP-2; and 10 mm dl-isocitric acid (trisodium salt) was added to start the reaction immediately prior to the first optical measurement. Where needed, calmodulin (7 μm) and SOD (23 μg/ml) were added as described in the figure legends. Control experiments were performed in the absence of nNOS. Quantitative analysis of the uncoupled [O2]/[O¯·2] ratio was performed using simultaneous measurements of oxygen consumption and the abovementioned dHRP trapping of superoxide anion. The reaction was carried out in an air-tight cuvette (2.22 ml), and the oxygenated standard reaction buffer was premixed with 160 or 100 μm dHRP, 200 μm MgCl2, 2.3 μm nNOS (BH4- and arginine-free), and 2 μm IDP-2; 10 mm dl-isocitric acid was added to start the reaction. The rate of compound III accumulation was calculated using the 583 nm extinction coefficient of 3.8 μm–1 cm–1 reported by Makino et al. (35Makino R. Tanaka T. Iizuka T. Ishimura Y. Kanegasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11444-11447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the corresponding oxygen consumption was recorded by the oxygen sensing system described below. Oxygen Consumption—The uptake of molecular oxygen was measured at 24 °C using a fluorescence-based oxygen sensing system consisting of an SD2000 dual channel spectrophotometer combined with an LS-450 Blue LED light source and a Foxy-18G probe, all from Ocean Optics (Dunedin FL). The oxygen sensing system depends on the fluorescence of a ruthenium complex in a sol-gel to measure the partial pressure of oxygen. As a triplet molecule, oxygen is able to quench efficiently the fluorescence from the ruthenium complex; when the oxygen concentration decreases, the fluorescence intensity increases accordingly, giving rise to a measurable signal to the spectrofluorometer. Measurements of oxygen concentration were calibrated by following the standardized protocols provided by Ocean Optics; the reactions were carried out in an air-tight cuvette (2.22 ml), designed and fabricated in the laboratory. After each experiment, a computer algorithm converted the fluorescence intensity to oxygen concentration, generating an oxygen trace over time. The standard reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 200 μm CaCl2, and 50 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) was stirred gently overnight to ensure full oxygenation. A typical reaction mixture contained 7 μm calmodulin, 23 μg/ml SOD, 1.7 μm catalase, 5.5 μm BH4, and 0.3–0.5 μm nNOS. To study the coupled reaction, either 500 μml-arginine or NOHA may be added. The reaction was started by the addition of NADPH to a final concentration of 440 μm. Determination of the [O2]/[NADPH] ratio was performed by injecting a small volume of NADPH quantitatively and monitoring the oxygen concentration trace. The reaction was carried out in the abovementioned oxygen apparatus. Standard reaction buffer containing 7 μm calmodulin, 23 μg/ml SOD, 1.7 μm catalase, 5.5 μm BH4, and 0.3–0.5 μm nNOS was mixed before multiple stepwise injections of NADPH, which started the reaction. Each injection contained a precisely determined amount of NADPH, and could only reduce a certain amount of oxygen. The [O2]/[NADPH] ratio was determined under three conditions: 1) totally uncoupled reaction in the absence of l-arginine or NOHA; 2) in the presence of 500 μml-arginine as substrate; and 3) in the presence of 500 μm NOHA as substrate. It is noteworthy that excessive amounts of SOD and catalase were present to avoid accumulation of ROS. Each experiment contains multiple injections of NADPH and the results were averaged; at the end of each experiment, an excessive amount of sodium dithionite was added to ensure depletion of oxygen. At least two different preparations of nNOS were used to confirm stoichiometry. Data Analysis—Oxygen consumption experiments generate an oxygen concentration trace, and its derivative as a rate trace (Fig. 4, B–D), from which the apparent Km value for oxygen is derived. Without knowing the exact site(s) for oxygen reduction, the apparent Km is a composite term that contains contributions from all possible sites (more in the discussion section). Basic enzyme kinetics equations were used in calculations. V = Vmax × [O2] / (Km +[O2]) Eq. 1 The apparent Km value for oxygen is defined as the oxygen concentration at which the velocity equals to half of the initial velocity. In the absence of l-arginine or NOHA, the reaction was totally uncoupled. When either l-arginine or NOHA was added, nNOS was partially uncoupled (more in the discussion section), and the overall oxygen consumption equals the weighted sum of both the coupled and uncoupled reactions. The apparent Km value we report in this study is a composite term that contains contributions from all underlying oxygen-consuming reactions. Qualitative Analysis of the Uncoupled Reaction—To identify the reactive oxygen species produced by nNOS, the basic uncoupled reaction was performed in the presence of dHRP and nNOS free of calmodulin, BH4, and l-arginine. The resultant spectra show the formation of compound III of dHRP (Fig. 1A), indicating O¯·2 formation by nNOS. With the reaction in progress, the spectrum of the ferric dHRP (λmax = 507 and 640 nm) changed to that of dHRP compound III (λmax = 550 and 585 nm). Sharp isosbestic points at 480, 530, and 605 nm conform to those reported in the literature (35Makino R. Tanaka T. Iizuka T. Ishimura Y. Kanegasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11444-11447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Makino R. Yamazaki I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1972; 72: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and indicate that O¯·2 was the only product formed under these conditions. The control experiment, performed in the absence of nNOS, showed no spectral change in 10 min. SOD converts O¯·2 to H2O2 at a rate that is diffusion limited (32Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar, 56Klug D. Rabani J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4839-4842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and would, presumably, convert the O¯·2 produced by nNOS to H2O2 before it could be used for compound III formation. The resultant H2O2 could then bind dHRP, forming compound II. As expected, the basic uncoupled reaction performed with SOD gave rise to typical compound II spectra of dHRP (λmax = 533 and 570 nm, isosbestic points 520 and 626 nm, Fig. 1B). Because SOD is present in this experiment, any change in the identity of the ROS produced would be masked, and sharp isosbestic points indicate adequate SOD activity. As shown in Fig. 1C, a plot of absorbance at 570 nm from Fig. 1B, addition of calmodulin during the time course of measurement accelerated the rate of H2O2 formation. To determine the effect of calmodulin on the formation of O¯·2 and H2O2, the basic uncoupled reaction was performed in the presence of calmodulin but not SOD (Fig. 1D). The reaction began by producing mostly superoxide anion in the first minute, as evidenced by the compound III spectra, but progressively more hydrogen peroxide was produced as the reaction proceeded in the next 6 min. A mixture of O¯·2 and H2O2 was evidenced by the conversion of the compound III spectra to spectra exhibiting a mixture of dHRP compound II and III features, such as the constant shifts of isosbestic points, from 530 to 520 nm, and from 605 to 626 nm (Fig. 1D). Further confidence in the formation of compound II was obtained by successful reconstruction of the experimental spectra with mathematically generated composite spectra, which contains spectral contributions from ferric dHRP, dHRP compound II, and dHRP compound III (simulation not shown). Quantitative Analysis of the Uncoupled Reaction—To analyze quantitatively the uncoupled [O2]/[O¯·2] stoichiometry, the rate of oxygen consumption was compared with the rate of O¯·2 formation, as derived from the formation of compound III. Difference spectra of dHRP compound III were produced by subtracting the spectrum of ferric dHRP from those recorded every 10 s after the reaction started (Fig. 2A). The sharp isosbestic points in Fig. 2A confirm that compound III formation is the only reaction occurring during the time course of 4 min. The oxygen consumption trace, performed simultaneously on the same sample, is shown in Fig. 2B; and Fig. 2C is the time-aligned simultaneous measurement in the first 80 s of the reaction. The rate of O¯·2 formation was calculated at 43 μm/min and O2 consumption 45 μm/min, representing a stoichiometry very close to the theoretical value of [O2]/[O¯·2] = 1/1. When a spectrum was recorded, the burst of light from the diode array spectrophotometer slightly interfered with the oxygen sensor, leaving small ticks visible on the oxygen concentration trace at 10-s intervals (Fig. 2, B and C); time alignment was achieved using these small ticks as an internal reference. The determination of the [O2]/[NADPH] ratio is shown in Fig. 3. At each step, 106 μm NADPH was added and the value of [O2]/NADPH determined. For example, in the second step, hydrolysis of 106 μm NADPH utilized (229–175) = 54 μm O2, giving the ratio of [O2]/NADPH = 54/106 = 0.51. The average of such measurements is shown in Table 1. In the absence of l-arginine or NOHA, the reaction was fully uncoupled, and the measured [O2]/[NADPH] ratio was 0.51, very close to the theoretical value 0.50 (Table 1). Unlike the uncoupled reaction, the measured [O2]/[NADPH] ratio with l-arginine or NOHA was significantly lower than the theoretical value (Table 1).TABLE 1Oxygen stoichiometry of nNOSSubstrate[O2]/[NADPH] ratioExperimental valueTheoretical valueNo l-arginine or NOHA0.51 ± 0.010.50l-Arginine1.14 ± 0.021.33NOHA1.44 ± 0.042.00"
https://openalex.org/W2058923987,"The use of pharmacologically active short peptide sequences is a better option in cancer therapeutics than the full-length protein. Here we report one such 44-mer peptide sequence of SMAR1 (TAT-SMAR1 wild type, P44) that retains the tumor suppressor activity of the full-length protein. The protein transduction domain of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, Tat protein was used here to deliver the 33-mer peptide of SMAR1 into the cells. P44 peptide could efficiently activate p53 by mediating its phosphorylation at serine 15, resulting in the activation of p21 and in effect regulating cell cycle checkpoint. In vitro phosphorylation assays with point-mutated P44-derived peptides suggested that serine 347 of SMAR1 was indispensable for its activity and represented the substrate motif for the protein kinase C family of proteins. Using xenograft nude mice models, we further demonstrate that P44 was capable of inhibiting tumor growth by preventing cellular proliferation. P44 treatment to tumor-bearing mice prevented the formation of poorly organized tumor vasculature and an increase in hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression, both being signatures of tumor progression. The chimeric TAT-SMAR1-derived peptide, P44, thus has a strong therapeutic potential as an anticancer drug."
https://openalex.org/W2032583013,"Mitochondrial gene expression in Trypanosoma brucei involves the coordination of multiple events including polycistronic transcript cleavage, polyadenylation, RNA stability, and RNA editing. Arg methylation of RNA binding proteins has the potential to influence many of these processes via regulation of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Here we demonstrate that Arg methylation differentially regulates the RNA binding capacity and macromolecular interactions of the mitochondrial gene regulatory protein, RBP16. We show that, in T. brucei mitochondria, RBP16 forms two major stable complexes: a 5 S multiprotein complex and an 11 S complex consisting of the 5 S complex associated with guide RNA (gRNA). Expression of a non-methylatable RBP16 mutant protein demonstrates that Arg methylation of RBP16 is required to maintain the protein-protein interactions necessary for assembly and/or stability of both complexes. Down-regulation of the major trypanosome type 1 protein arginine methyltransferase, TbPRMT1, disrupts formation of both the 5 and 11 S complexes, indicating that TbPRMT1-catalyzed methylation of RBP16 Arg-78 and Arg-85 is critical for complex formation. We also show that Arg methylation decreases the capacity of RBP16 to associate with gRNA. This is not a general effect on RBP16 RNA binding, however, since methylation conversely increases the association of the protein with mRNA. Thus, TbPRMT1-catalyzed Arg methylation has distinct effects on RBP16 gRNA and mRNA association and gRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complex (gRNP) formation.

Kinetoplastid editing entails insertion and deletion of uridine residues at numerous editing sites as directed by mitochondrially encoded, trans-acting guide RNAs (gRNAs). 3The abbreviations used are: gRNA, guide RNAs; RNAi, RNA interference; CYb, apocytochrome b; PRMT, protein arginine methyltransferase; ND4, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4; COI, cytochrome oxidase I; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; gRNP, gRNA-containing RNP complex; CAPS, (cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid; WT, wild-type; TRI, triple mutant; A6, ATPase subunit 6. 3The abbreviations used are: gRNA, guide RNAs; RNAi, RNA interference; CYb, apocytochrome b; PRMT, protein arginine methyltransferase; ND4, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4; COI, cytochrome oxidase I; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; gRNP, gRNA-containing RNP complex; CAPS, (cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid; WT, wild-type; TRI, triple mutant; A6, ATPase subunit 6. During editing, the gRNA 5′ anchor region base pairs with the target mRNA 3′ of the editing site. An internal information coding region, present within the gRNA, guides uridine insertion and deletion through base pairing. A post-transcriptionally added poly(U) tail, present on the 3′ end of all mature gRNAs, provides stabilization of mRNA-gRNA interactions. This transcript maturation progresses in a 3′-5′ direction and is catalyzed by a large multisubunit complex termed the editosome (4Stuart K.D. Panigrahi A.K. Mol.

The enzymatic reactions involved in editing include endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA, uridine insertion or deletion, and religation of the 3′ and 5′ mRNA fragments. Although the core components of the editosome are under intense study, accessory proteins that augment and/or regulate editing have only just begun to be identified (9Pelletier M. Read L.K. RNA (N.

In accordance with its multifunctional nature, RBP16 is classified as a member of the Y-box family, which includes proteins that perform multiple roles in gene expression. For example, the mammalian Y-box protein, YB-1, acts in transcription, RNA stability, translation, and RNA packaging (13Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P.

Cells depleted for RBP16 via RNA interference (RNAi) display severe defects in growth as well as a dramatic and specific down-regulation in the editing of the mitochondrial apocytochrome b (CYb) transcript (9Pelletier M. Read L.K. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, CYb RNA editing is stimulated in vitro by addition of recombinant RBP16 at, or prior to, the endonucleolytic cleavage of mRNA (12Miller M.M. Halbig K. Cruz-Reyes J. Read L.K. RNA (N. Y.). 2006; 12: 1292-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). RBP16 also plays a complex role in RNA stabilization in T. brucei mitochondria. The stability of the never-edited mitochondrial transcripts cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) is decreased upon RBP16 down-regulation (9Pelletier M. Read L.K. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), while overexpression of RBP16 serves to stabilize edited and unedited CYb and cytochrome oxidase III mRNAs (11Goulah C.C. Pelletier M. Read L.K. RNA (N. Y.). 2006; 12: 1545-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).In mitochondria, RBP16 is associated with ∼30% of the total gRNA pool, 9 S and 12 S rRNAs, and several mitochondrial mRNA species, as demonstrated by in organello cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation from mitochondrial extract (18Hayman M.L.

The CYb transcript, whose editing is RBP16-dependent, is minimally edited and thus presumably utilizes a very small percentage of the total gRNA (20Riley G.R. Corell R.A. Stuart K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6101-6108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The disparity between the percentage of gRNAs involved in CYb editing and the large percentage of the total gRNA population that is bound by RBP16 in vivo suggests an additional function for RBP16 relating to the packaging and protection of gRNA and/or the delineation of their usage. Furthermore, the transcript-specific facets of RBP16 action in combination with its broad RNA binding properties strongly argues that RBP16 functions in association with additional mitochondrial proteins, some of which may confer sequence specificity (9Pelletier M. Read L.K. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Militello K.M. Hayman M.L. Read L.K. Int. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1266-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).RBP16 is post-translationally modified by arginine methylation on three residues in its RG-rich C terminus. Genetic experiments demonstrated that methylation is important for many of the RNA stabilization functions of RBP16 (11Goulah C.C. Pelletier M. Read L.K. RNA (N. Y.). 2006; 12: 1545-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In yeast and mammals, Arg methylation has been associated with a variety of cellular processes including signal transduction, subcellular localization, transcription, and RNA processing (23Bedford M.T.

The effects of Arg methylation on these processes are mediated primarily through the regulation of protein-protein and, less commonly, protein-RNA interactions (28Li H. Park S. Kilburn B.

Ceman S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 15: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Arg methylation has also been recognized as a targeting signal in the process of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex assembly (32Friesen W.J. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Massenet S. Pesiridis G.S. Van Duyne G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8289-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 33Meister G. Eggert C. Buhler D. Brahms H. Kambach C. Fischer U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1990-1994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The role of Arg methylation in RBP16 protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions has not been explored at the biochemical level.In this paper, we demonstrate that native RBP16 is almost entirely present in two macromolecular complexes of 5 and 11 S, the larger of which is a gRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complex (gRNP). The 11 S gRNP is reduced toa5S complex upon RNase treatment. These data, along with the inability to identify gRNA in the endogenous 5 S complex, indicate that the 5 S complex is a protein subunit of the 11 S gRNP. Exogenously expressed non-methylatable RBP16 is compromised for 5 and 11 S complex formation, in a similar fashion as endogenous RBP16 in cells down-regulated for the major trypanosome type 1 protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT), TbPRMT1. Thus, Arg methylation of RBP16 is necessary for the proper macromolecular interactions involved in formation of both endogenous complexes. Our data are consistent with a model in which Arg methylation is required for maintenance of RBP16 protein-protein interactions. We also show that, in contrast to its role in facilitating RBP16 protein-protein interactions, Arg methylation significantly decreases the ability of RBP16 to associate with gRNA. This does not reflect a general inhibition of RBP16-RNA interactions, however, since methylation strongly increases the association of RBP16 with specific mRNAs. Together, our data demonstrate distinct roles for RBP16 methylation in specific protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions. Thus, Arg methylation of RBP16 has the potential to regulate the actions of this multifunctional protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Oligonucleotides—For poisoned primer extension analyses, the following oligodeoxynucleotides were used: A6-3′ NE (5′-GCGGATCCATTTGATCTTATTCTATAACTCC-3′), CYb-RT-GP (5′-CAACCTGACATTAAAAGAC-3′), COI-RT (5′-GTAATGAGTACGTTGTAAAACTG-3′), ND4-RT (5′-GATAAAAATATTAGTGACATTG-3′).Trypanosome Growth, Transfection, and Induction of Myc-RBP16—Procyclic T. brucei strain 29-13 (provided by George Cross), which contains integrated genes for T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor, was grown in SDM-79 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum as described (34Brun R. Schonenberg M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar), in the presence of G418 (15 μg/ml) and hygromycin (50 μg/ml). The Myc-RBP16-WT, Myc-RBP16-TRI (11Goulah C.C. Pelletier M. Read L.K. RNA (N. Y.). 2006; 12: 1545-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and TbPRMT1 RNAi cell lines (36Pelletier M. Pasternack D.A. Read L.K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 144: 206-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were supplemented with phleomycin (2.5 μg/ml). Exogenous protein expression and RNAi was induced by adding 2.5 μg/ml tetracycline and allowing the cultures to grow for 4 days prior to mitochondrial harvesting (11Goulah C.C. Pelletier M. Read L.K. RNA (N. Y.). 2006; 12: 1545-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were purified as described (37Harris M.E. Moore D.R. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11368-11376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation—Mitochondrial extract was obtained from 1 × 1010 cell equivalents by adding 500 μl of mitochondrial lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgOAc, 100 μm ATP, 1% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, Complete® EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) and 40 units of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen) (note: RNaseOUT not added to samples to be RNase-treated)) to purified mitochondria and rocking for 5 min at 4 °C prior to clarification by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. Samples that were RNase A-treated were incubated with 100 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) at 37 °C for 15 min prior to loading onto gradients. His-RBP16 was purified as described previously (38Miller M.M. Read L.K. Exp. Parasitol. 2003; 105: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Five-hundred μl of purified mitochondrial extract or 1.6 μg of recombinant His-RBP16 was layered onto a 12-ml 5–20% linear glycerol gradient (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgOAc, 100 μm ATP, Complete® EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) and 5 or 20% glycerol). The gradient was centrifuged for 20 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW-41 rotor at 35,000 rpm. Twenty-four fractions (500 μl) were collected from the top of the tube.Western Blotting—For analysis of 29-13, Myc-RBP16-WT, and Myc-RBP16-TRI extracts fractionated by glycerol gradient sedimentation, 10-μl aliquots of each fraction were separated by 17% SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) at 50 V for 35 min in 10 mm CAPS buffer (pH 11.0) containing 10% methanol. The membrane was probed using either polyclonal anti-RBP16 (21Hayman M.L. Read L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12067-12074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or polyclonal anti-Myc (Covance) antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution in Tris-buffered saline with 2% dry milk. Primary antibodies were detected using goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce Endogen), and detected by ECL (GE Healthcare).Immunoprecipitation and Isolation of Associated RNA—Ten μg of purified anti-RBP16 (21Hayman M.L. Read L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12067-12074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), anti-Myc (Covance), or IgG purified from pre-immune serum was incubated with 250 μl of mitochondrial extract or 500 μl of pooled gradient fractions with rocking at 4 °C for 1 to 2 h. Twenty μl of rProtA-Sepharose (50% slurry) (GE Healthcare) washed twice in mitochondrial lysis buffer (see above) was added to each tube and incubated with rocking at 4 °C for 1 to 2 h. The bead bound material was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min and the non-bound supernatant transferred to a separate tube. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of mitochondrial lysis buffer and resuspended in a volume of mitochondrial lysis buffer equivalent to the non-bound supernatant. For protein analysis, 10% of each fraction was mixed with an appropriate volume of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue, and 400 mm dithiothreitol). For RNA analysis, the remainder of each fraction was incubated with 0.5% SDS (final), 50 μg/ml of proteinase K (final) (Promega), and 2 units of RNaseOut. After 30 min at 37 °C, RNA was twice extracted with phenol/chloroform and salt/ethanol-precipitated. Immunoprecipitation of total mitochondrial extract and 5 and 11 S complexes, as well as subsequent bound RNA analysis (see below), was performed three to four times, using at least two different mitochondrial preparations, with similar results.Guanylyltransferase Labeling—An aliquot of each RNA sample was labeled by incubation with 10 μCi of α-[32P]GTP and 2.2 pmol of recombinant guanylyltransferase from vaccinia virus (a generous gift of Ed Niles) (39Blum B. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 62: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 40Higman M.A. Bourgeois N. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16430-16437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 30 min at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 6 mm KCl, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 40 units of RNaseOUT. An equal volume of 90% formamide loading buffer was added to each sample and one third of each reaction was separated on a 7 m urea/10% polyacrylamide gel in 0.6× TBE. Gels were analyzed by overnight exposure to a Bio-Rad Phosphor Imaging Screen K and scanning by Bio-Rad Personal FX with densitometry analysis using Bio-Rad Quantity One software. Differential RNA species were identified based on previously published sizes (21Hayman M.L. Read L.K. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8174-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as compared with labeled markers. The percent bound for each lane was calculated by adding the relative abundance of the bound and not bound lanes and dividing by the sum. The amount specifically bound was calculated by subtracting the percent bound by the preserum from the percent bound by the purified antibody.Poisoned Primer Extension Analyses—Poisoned primer extensions were performed essentially as described (11Goulah C.C. Pelletier M. Read L.K. RNA (N. Y.). 2006; 12: 1545-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), except using immunoprecipitated RNA and 0.5 pmol of 5′-32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide primer.His-RBP16/gRNA Binding Assay—The gCYb[558] clone was described previously (20Riley G.R. Corell R.A. Stuart K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6101-6108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was synthesized in vitro using the Ambion Megascript kit and gel-purified on a 7 m urea, 6% acrylamide gel. One-hundred fmol (1.6 μg) of purified His-RBP16 (38Miller M.M. Read L.K. Exp. Parasitol. 2003; 105: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was incubated alone or with either 100 fmol (2.2 μg) of gCYb[558] (1:1 molar ratio) or 1 nmol (22 μg) of gCYb[558] (10:1 molar ratio) at 27 °C for 20 min in mitochondrial lysis buffer prior to glycerol gradient fractionation.RESULTSRBP16 Is Present in Two Complexes of 5 and 11 S—To identify RBP16 macromolecular interactions we analyzed the ability of RBP16 to form multicomponent complexes by glycerol gradient sedimentation. Mitochondrial extract from procyclic strain 29-13 T. brucei cells was fractionated on a linear 5–20% gradient. Analysis of gradient fractions by anti-RBP16 Western blot revealed two RBP16-containing complexes of ∼5 and 11 S, based on sedimentation of markers in a parallel gradient (Fig. 1, top). In contrast, recombinant His-RBP16 displayed a sedimentation coefficient of ∼1.2 S (Fig. 1, bottom), confirming previous results that free RBP16 does not form homomultimers (18Hayman M.L. Miller M.M. Chandler D.M. Goulah C.C. Read L.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 43Schnaufer A. Ernst N. O'Rear J. Salavati R. Stuart K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 307-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, the majority of native RBP16 is present in complexes with other macromolecules.To determine whether the 5 S and/or 11 S complex contains an RNA component, we pretreated mitochondrial extract with RNase A for 15 min at 37 °C prior to gradient fractionation. As shown in Fig. 1 (middle), the 11 S complex was completely disrupted following RNase treatment, while the 5 S complex was apparently unaffected. These data indicate that the 11 S complex contains an unprotected RNA component, while the 5 S complex is either lacking an RNA component or contains an RNA that is protected from RNase A treatment.The RBP16 11 S Complex Contains gRNA—Because RBP16 has previously been shown to bind ∼30% of the total gRNA pool in vivo (9Pelletier M. Read L.K. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Hayman M.L. Read L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12067-12074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether the RNA component of the major RBP16-containing complexes was gRNA. We first asked whether a substantial portion of total mitochondrial gRNA co-sediments with either the 5 or 11 S complex. To this end, RNA from each fraction of a 5 to 20% glycerol gradient was extracted and labeled with α-[32P]GTP using recombinant guanylyltransferase from vaccinia virus (40Higman M.A. Bourgeois N. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16430-16437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure only labels primary transcripts that possess a 5′ di- or triphosphate (44Ensinger M.J. Martin S.A. Paoletti E. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2525-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and has been previously shown to label primarily gRNAs in kinetoplastid mitochondria (39Blum B. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 62: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, while gRNAs were broadly distributed across the gradient, the majority of gRNAs sedimented in two peaks of ∼11 S and >19 S. The larger peak may represent the association of gRNA with the multiprotein editosome complex. The gRNA peak at 11 S suggests that the 11 S RBP16-containing complex may contain gRNA.FIGURE 2The 11 S complex contains gRNA. A, total RNA from each of the glycerol gradient fractions from Fig. 1 was isolated by ethanol/salt precipitation and labeled with α-[32P]GTP using recombinant guanylyltransferase, which specifically labels gRNA. Radiolabeled products were separated on an 7 m urea, 10% acrylamide gel and visualized by phosphorimager analysis. B, peak RBP16-containing glycerol gradient fractions (3–6 for 5 S and 11–14 for 11 S) were pooled and immunoprecipitated with preimmune IgG or anti-RBP16 antibodies, and the associated RNA was isolated. RNA was labeled with guanylyltransferase as described for A. The left panel shows RNA present in the total (T) and immunoprecipitated 5 S region of the gradient, while the right panel corresponds to the 11 S region of the gradient. Percent bound and percent specifically bound were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The images shown are representative of the results. The values under each lane are the average quantification of the percent bound from three experiments. The percent of specifically bound gRNA in each complex is shown in parentheses below the figures and represents the average and standard deviation from three experiments.

RNA from each fraction was labeled with α-[32P]GTP using recombinant guanylyltransferase as described above (Fig. 2B). Examination of the total gRNA from the pooled fractions confirmed that there is significantly more gRNA in the 11 S region than in the 5 S region (Fig. 2B, lanes T). Analysis of the RNA in anti-RBP16 immunoprecipitates from these regions of the gradient revealed that an average of 21% of the gRNA in the 11 S region of the gradient is specifically associated with RBP16 (Fig. 2B, right panel), while the 5 S RBP16-containing complex contains little more than background levels of gRNA (Fig. 2B, left panel) (for calculation of specifically bound RNA, see “Experimental Procedures”). Together, these data suggest that the 5 S complex is devoid of RNA and consists of RBP16 associated with at least one other protein, while the 11 S complex contains both gRNA and additional protein(s).Non-methylated RBP16 Fails to Form Endogenous Complexes—RBP16 is methylated on three arginine residues in its C-terminal RG-rich domain (Arg-78, Arg-85, Arg-93) (11Goulah C.C.

Exposure of untransfected C5N keratinocytes and transfected HEK293 cells to phorbol esters (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)) increased PED/PEA-15 cellular content and enhanced its phosphorylation at serine 116 in a time-dependent fashion. Ser-116 → Gly (PEDS116G) but not Ser-104 → Gly (PEDS104G) substitution almost completely abolished TPA regulation of PED/PEA-15 expression. TPA effect was also prevented by antisense inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC)-ζ and by the expression of a dominant-negative PKC-ζ mutant cDNA in HEK293 cells. Similar to long term TPA treatment, overexpression of wild-type PKC-ζ increased cellular content and phosphorylation of WT-PED/PEA-15 and PEDS104G but not of PEDS116G. These events were accompanied by the activation of Ca2+-calmodulin kinase (CaMK) II and prevented by the CaMK blocker, KN-93. At variance, the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin mimicked TPA action on PED/PEA-15 intracellular accumulation and reverted the effects of PKC-ζ and CaMK inhibition. Moreover, we show that PED/PEA-15 bound ubiquitin in intact cells. PED/PEA-15 ubiquitinylation was reduced by TPA and PKC-ζ overexpression and increased by KN-93 and PKC-ζ block. Furthermore, in HEK293 cells expressing PEDS116G, TPA failed to prevent ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the protein. Accordingly, in the same cells, TPA-mediated protection from apoptosis was blunted. Taken together, our results indicate that TPA increases PED/PEA-15 expression at the post-translational level by inducing phosphorylation at serine 116 and preventing ubiquitinylation and proteosomal degradation.

Cancer cells feature both excessive proliferation and abandonment of the ability to die (1Duke R.C. Ojcius D.M. Young J.D. Sci.

Thus, alterations of genes involved in the control of apoptosis have been implicated in a number of human malignancies. In certain lymphomas, for example, cell death is blocked by excessive production of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 (2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar). Similarly, some tumors prevent apoptosis by up-regulating the expression of anti-apoptotic death effector domain (DED) 2The abbreviations used are: DED, death effector domain; PED/PEA, phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes/phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; PKB, protein kinase B; PKC, protein kinase C; CaMK, calmodulin kinase; FADD, Fas-associated death domain; HA, hemagglutinin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ab, antibody; ASO, antisense oligonucleotides; DN, dominant-negative; WT, wild type; SO, scrambled.-containing proteins, which, in turn, inhibit Fas from conveying signals to the death machinery (3Barnhart B.C.

The molecular mechanism of PED/PEA-15 anti-apoptotic action has been extensively investigated. In several cell types, PED/PEA-15 blocks Fas- and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis by competing with its DED with the interaction between FADD and caspase 8 (10Condorelli G. Vigliotta G.

In addition, in several cell lines of human glioma, PED/PEA-15 inhibits tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis, thereby generating resistance to this anti-neoplastic agent (9Hao C.

It has recently been shown that PED/PEA-15 phosphorylation at specific sites controls the ability of the protein to form complexes with specific intracellular interactors (21Renganathan H. Vaidyanathan H. Knapinska A. Ramos J.W. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).

However, the precise function of these phosphorylation sites in controlling PED/PEA-15 expression is currently unknown. Recent evidence indicates that abnormal accumulation of PED/PEA-15 may lead to derangement of cell growth and metabolism (15Formisano P. Perruolo G. Libertini S. Santopietro S. Troncone G.

In this study, we have shown that phorbol esters, which are tumor promoters and inhibitors of insulin action, up-regulate PED/PEA-15 expression by inhibiting its ubiquitinylation and proteasomal targeting. This effect involves activation of CaMKII and subsequent phosphorylation of PED/PEA-15 at Ser-116. PKC-ζ activity is required for phorbol ester-induced activation of CaMKII and for the regulation of PED/PEA-15 degradation.

Western blotting and ECL reagents and radiochemicals were from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were from Sigma. Plasmid Preparation, Cell Culture, and Transfection—The PEDS104G and PEDS116G mutant cDNAs were prepared by using pcDNAIIIPEDY1 cDNA (pcDNAIII containing His6-Myc-tagged PED/PEA-15) as template with the site-directed mutagenesis kit by Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable expression of the mutants and wild-type PEDY1 cDNAs in HEK293 cells (293PEDY1) was achieved as reported in Condorelli et al. (11Condorelli G. Trencia A. Vigliotta G. Perfetti A. Goglia U.

The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU of penicillin/ml, 100 IU of streptomycin/ml, and 2% l-glutamine in a humidified CO2 incubator. Transient transfection of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides and plasmid DNA in HEK293 cells was accomplished by using the Lipofectamine method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were cultured in 60-mm-diameter dishes and incubated for 24 h in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 3 μg of cDNA and 15 μl of Lipofectamine reagent. An equal volume of DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum was then added for 5 h followed by replacement with DMEM supplemented with 10% serum for 24 h before the assays. Western Blot Analysis—For Western blotting, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4PO7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mg of aprotinin/ml, 1 mm leupeptin) for 60 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were clarified at 5,000 × g for 15 min. Solubilized proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto 0.45-μm-pore size Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Upon incubation with the primary (PED, etc.) antibody and secondary antibodies, immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time RT-PCR Analysis—Total cellular RNA was isolated from C5N cells by the use of RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For real-time RT-PCR analysis, 1 μg of cell RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR reaction mixes were analyzed using SYBR Green mix (Invitrogen). Reactions were performed using Platinum SYBR Green quantitative PCR Super-UDG using an iCycler IQ multicolor real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). All reactions were performed in triplicate, and β-actin was used as an internal standard. Primer sequences used were as follows: PED/PEA-15, forward, 5′-TTCCCGCTGTTCCCTTAGG-3′, and PED/PEA-15, reverse 5′-TCTGGCTCATCCGCATCC-3′. Immunoprecipitation of PED/PEA-15—Cells grown in 100-mm Petri dishes were treated as indicated and washed once with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in lysis buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Then, lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 20 min. 500 μg of protein lysates was immunoprecipitated with Myc or PED antibodies for 16 h. The precipitates were incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h with shaking. Beads were precipitated by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed five times with ice-cold washing buffer. After the final wash, the pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of 1× SDS electrophoresis buffer and heated to 95 °C for 5 min prior to protein separation by 15% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed as described above. Purification of Ubiquitin-PED/PEA-15 Conjugates—Cellular ubiquitinylation assay was performed as described by Musti et al. (29Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Science. 1997; 275: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transfection, cells expressing His-tagged-PED/PEA-15 (PED/PEA-15Y1) and HA-ubiquitin were harvested in 2 ml of 6 m guanidium-HCl, 0.1 m Na2 HPO4/NaH2 PO4 (pH 8) plus 5 mm imidazole/100-mm dish and sonicated with a Branson micro-tipped sonifier for 30 s to reduce viscosity. Lysates were mixed on a rotator with 0.2 ml (settled volume) of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 4 h at room temperature. The slurry was applied to a Bio-Rad Econo-Column. The column was successively washed with the following: 1 ml of 6 m guanidium-HCl, 0.1 m Na2 HPO4, NaH2 PO4 (pH 8); 2 ml of 6 m guanidium-HCl, 0.1 m Na2 HPO4, NaH2 PO4 (pH 5.8); 1 ml of 6 m guanidium-HCl, 0.1 m Na2 HPO4, NaH2 PO4 (pH 8); 2 ml of (6 m guanidium-HCl, 0.1 m Na2 HPO4, NaH2 PO4 (pH 8), protein buffer) 1:1; 2 ml of (6 m guanidium-HCl, 0.1 m Na2 HPO4, NaH2 PO4 (pH 8), protein buffer) 1:3; 2 ml of protein buffer; 1 ml of protein buffer plus 10 mm imidazole.

The eluate was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated for further analysis by Western blot with HA antibody. Cell Death Analysis by Flow Cytometry—Cells were harvested and suspended in the sample buffer (PBS + 2% fetal bovine serum; PBS + 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and washed and resuspended in 0.3 ml of PBS. After adding 0.7 ml of cold absolute ethanol, cells were fixed for at least 2 h at –20 °C, washed twice, and resuspended in 0.4 ml of PBS. Samples were then incubated with 20 μl of propidium iodide (1 mg/ml stock solution) and 2 μl of RNaseA (500 mg/ml stock solution) in dark for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were stored at 4 °C until analyzed by flow cytometry. Regulation of PED/PEA-15 Protein Expression by Phorbol Esters—The expression of PED/PEA-15 is up-regulated by phorbol myristate acetate (TPA) in the mouse skin upon experimental carcinogenesis as well as in different human tumors (7Condorelli G.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating PED/PEA-15 expression, HEK-293 cells, stably transfected with PED/PEA-15 cDNA (293PEDY1), were incubated with serum-free medium in the absence or in the presence of 1 μm TPA. Treatment of 293PEDY1 cells with TPA increased PED/PEA-15 levels in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Serum deprivation alone was sufficient to reduce PED/PEA-15 protein levels by >3-fold (Fig. 1B). This decrease was totally reverted by the simultaneous exposure to TPA. Pretreatment of the cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (40 μg/ml) reduced TPA effect by only 25% (Fig. 1B, left panel). Similar results were also obtained by evaluating the levels of PED/PEA-15 in C5N keratinocytes, expressing only the endogenous compendium of the protein (Fig. 1B, right panel). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2, PED/PEA-15 mRNA was also increased in untransfected C5N cells following 6 and 20 h of TPA treatment. Thus, TPA up-regulates PED/PEA-15 mRNA and protein expression. However, TPA regulation is, at least in part, independent of protein synthesis.FIGURE 2TPA effect on PED/PEA-15 mRNA levels. The abundance of mRNAs for PED/PEA-15 was determined by real-time RT-PCR analysis of total RNA isolated from C5N cells following treatment with TPA (1 μm) for the indicated times, using β-actin as internal standard. The mRNA levels in TPA-stimulated cells are relative to those in control cells. Each error bar represents the mean ± S.D. of four independent experiments in each of which reactions were performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Regulation of PED/PEA-15 Expression by Serine Phosphorylation—It has been shown that PED/PEA-15 expression is tightly regulated by its phosphorylation state (22Trencia A. Perfetti A. Cassese A. Vigliotta G. Miele C. Oriente F. Santopietro S. Giacco F. Condorelli G. Formisano P. Beguinot F. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4511-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether TPA could induce PED/PEA-15 phosphorylation. To this end, protein extracts of TPA-stimulated 293PEDY1 and C5N cells were immunoblotted with antibodies against the phosphorylated forms of Ser-104 and Ser-116 (Fig. 3A). In 293PEDY1 cells, Ser-104 phosphorylation increased within the initial 30 min of TPA exposure, declining thereafter. At variance, Ser-116 phosphorylation was barely detectable at 30 min and progressively raised for up to 20 h after TPA exposure. Similarly, in C5N keratinocytes, 20 h of TPA treatment led to a significant increase of Ser-116 phosphorylation, with almost undetectable changes of Ser-104 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). To assess the relevance of those phosphorylation sites, PED/PEA-15 mutants bearing Ser-104 → Gly (PEDS104G) or Ser-116 → Gly (PEDS116G) substitutions were transfected in HEK293 cells. TPA treatment increased the levels of the wild-type PED/PEA-15 (PEDWT) and of PEDS104G by about 4-fold. At variance, PEDS116G expression was increased by only 2-fold upon TPA exposure (Fig. 3B), suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser-116 is required for TPA regulation of PED/PEA-15 expression. PKC Regulation of PED/PEA-15 Expression—To identify the kinase responsible for the regulation of PED/PEA-15 expression, 293PEDY1 cells were treated with specific phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) toward individual PKC isoforms (Fig. 4). Based on Western blot experiments, ASO for PKC-α, -β, and -δ did not significantly affect PED/PEA-15 expression levels when compared with scrambled (SO) oligonucleotide controls. The expression of the targeted PKC isoform was selectively reduced by >50%, however. At variance, ASO-mediated silencing of PKC-ζ expression (PKCζ-ASO) was accompanied by a significant 70% decrease of PED/PEA-15 levels (Fig. 4). A scrambled oligonucleotide (PKCζ-SO) did not induce any detectable change (Fig. 4). A reduction of PED/PEA-15 expression was also observed when 293PEDY1 cells were transfected with a dominant-negative (DN) PKC-ζ mutant or with PKCζ-ASO and stimulated with TPA for 20 h (Fig. 5A). CaMKII and Akt/PKB have been shown to directly phosphorylate PED/PEA-15 at Ser-116 (22Trencia A. Perfetti A. Cassese A. Vigliotta G. Miele C. Oriente F. Santopietro S. Giacco F. Condorelli G.

Interestingly, a 75% decrease of PED/PEA-15 expression was also detected in 293PEDY1 cells treated with the CaMK inhibitor, KN-93 (Fig. 5A). Similarly, in C5N keratinocytes, TPA-induced up-regulation of PED/PEA-15 protein expression was reduced by about 70% by KN-93 treatment (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5Regulation of PED/PEA-15 expression levels by PKCζ and CaMK. 293PEDY1 (A) and C5N (B) cells were serum-starved and treated with 1 μm TPA or with 10 μm KN-93 for 20 h in the absence or in the presence of PKCζ-ASO and PKCζ-SO or DN-PKCζ, as indicated. Cell lysates were then analyzed by PKC-ζ (upper part) or PED Ab (lower part) immunoblot, and the results were quantitated by laser densitometry. The autoradiographs shown are representative of four (A) and three (B) independent experiments.

In this regard, CaMKII phosphorylation (Fig. 6A) was induced by TPA and well correlated with increased PED/PEA-15 expression levels and Ser-116 phosphorylation in 293PEDY1 cells (Figs. 1A and 3A). Consistently, 20 h of TPA treatment of C5N cells was accompanied by a 2.5-fold increase of CaMKII phosphorylation (Fig. 6"

Heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase (HS-2OST) transfers the sulfo group from 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the 2-OH position of the hexauronic acid that is adjacent to N-sulfated glucosamine, whereas chondroitin sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase (CS-2OST) transfers the sulfo group to the hexauronic acid that is adjacent to N-acetylated galactosamine.

Growing evidence suggests that glycosaminoglycans have diverse roles in regulating embryonic development, neuron development, blood coagulation, immune response, carcinogenesis, virus infection, wound repair, etc., mainly through the HS or CS chains with specific structures (1Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar, 2Liu J. Thorp S.C. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The diverse structures of HS and CS are synthesized by complex biosynthetic pathways, which take place in the Golgi apparatus. The HS backbone is synthesized as a copolymer of GlcUA and N-acetylated glucosamine (GlcNAc) by HS copolymerase EXT1 and EXT2, followed by various modifications. These modifications include N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of GlcNAc, C5 epimerization of glucuronic acid to form IdoUA residues, 2-O-sulfation of or GlcUA residues, and 6-O-sulfation and 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues (3Kusche-Gullberg M.

The modifications of CS chain include 4-O-sulfation or 6-O-sulfation on GalNAc, C5 epimerization of GlcUA to IdoUA, and 2-O-sulfation on GlcUA or IdoUA (3Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. Curr. Opin.

The 2-O-sulfation of IdoUA by HS-2OST is necessary for the binding to many members of the fibroblast growth factor family, essential for the initiation of fibroblast growth factor-mediated signal transduction pathways (7Kreuger J.

The HS-2OST knock-out mice show renal agenesis and die in the neonatal period, and they have over-mineralized skeletons and show retardation of eye development (9Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, HS-2OST has been determined to be essential for cell migration and nervous system development (10Bulow H.E. Hobert O. Neuron. 2004; 41: 723-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 11Kinnunen T. Huang Z. Townsend J. Gatdula M.M. Brown J.R. Esko J.D. Turnbull J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Various functions of CS-2OST have also been identified by several studies. The 2-O-sulfation of IdoUA in a highly sulfated chondroitin sulfate B (dermatan sulfate) hexasaccharide sequence has been determined to contribute to heparin cofactor II binding, regulating the blood coagulation cascade (12Maimone M.M. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18263-18271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been implicated that a polysaccharide structure containing IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc(4S), IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S), or GlcUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S) units exerts potent neurite out-growth-promoting activities. These structural motifs contain 2-O-sulfated glucuronic or 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid residues, which are biosynthesized by CS-2OST, suggesting an important role of CS-2OST in the development of the mammalian central nervous system (13Bao X.

Although HS-2OST and CS-2OST sulfate different polysaccharide substrates, they are strikingly homologous. Human HS-2OST and CS-2OST share 32% identity and 56% similarity in their sulfotransferase (ST) domain. Both enzymes have only one isoform in most of the genome-sequenced organisms (with the exception of fish), in contrast to multiple isoforms for almost all other HS and CS STs. HS-2OST and CS-2OST are also conserved across species. Human HS-2OST shares 75% similarity to insect HS-2OSTs and 67% to C. elegans HS-2OST, whereas all vertebrate CS-2OSTs share greater than 85% similarity in the ST domain. HS-2OST transfers the sulfo group from PAPS to the 2-OH position of the hexauronic acid, with a preference for iduronic acid, which is adjacent to an N-sulfated glucosamine (GlcNS) residue (15Rong J. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5548-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whereas CS-2OST transfers the sulfo group to the 2-OH position of the hexauronic acid that is adjacent to an N-acetylated galactosamine residue (GalNAc) carrying either a 6-O or 4-O sulfo group (16Kobayashi M.

In this study, we report a systematic mutagenesis study of HS-2OST and CS-2OST based on their structural homology to other members of the ST superfamily. We have identified six residues in each enzyme that participate in PAPS binding, five residues that potentially mediate substrate binding in HS-2OST, and four residues in CS-2OST. Additionally, we identified two histidine residues that are essential for the catalytic functions of HS-2OST, although one histidine residue was identified in CS-2OST. The unique structural feature in the catalytic sites of HS-2OST and CS-2OST led us identify a homologous protein in Drosophila, dmHs2st, as the Drosophila HS-2OST. Analysis of the previously suggested HS-2OST from Drosophila (18Sen J. Goltz J.S. Stevens L. Stein D. Cell. 1998; 95: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the gene product of pipe, displays neither HS-2OST nor CS-2OST activity. Preparation of HS-2OST and CS-2OST Bacterial Expression Plasmids (HS-2OST-pET21b and CS-2OST-pET32b)—The catalytic domains of HS-2OST of Chinese hamster (Glu28-Asn356) and human CS-2OST (Asn84-Arg406) were cloned into the pET21b and pET32b vectors (Novagen), respectively, using the EcoRI and HindIII sites to construct a C-terminal His6-tagged HS-2OST protein and an N-terminal thioredoxin-His6-tagged CS-2OST fusion protein. The full-length cDNA of hamster HS-2OST and human CS-2OST were gifts from Dr. Rosenberg (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Preparation of Drosophila dmHs2st, pip-PA, and pip-PF Bacterial Expression Plasmids—The Drosophila cDNA clones encoding dmHs2st (GH20044) and pip-PF (RE07829) were ordered from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL), and the cDNA clone encoding for pip-PA (LD12641) was ordered from Drosophila Genomics Resource Center (Indiana University). The cDNA fragment encoding for the catalytic domain of dmHs2st (Arg39-Lys349) was amplified and cloned into pET32b vector using EcoRI and SalI sites to generate an N-terminal thioredoxin-His6-tagged dmHs2st fusion protein. The cDNA fragments encoding for the putative catalytic domain of pip-PA(Met106-Asn413) and pip-PF(Ser102-Phe397) were amplified and cloned into pMAL-c2X vector (New England Biolabs) using the EcoRI and HindIII sites to generate N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tagged pipPA as well as pipPF fusion proteins. Preparation of HS-2OST and CS-2OST Mutants—The mutants of HS-2OST and CS-2OST were prepared using HS-2OST-pET21b and CS-2OST-pET32b as the templates, respectively, and a method modified from Stratagene Quickchange mutagenesis kit has been described elsewhere (19Zheng L. Baumann U. Reymond J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). The primers for preparing mutants were synthesized by Invitrogen. The resultant constructs were sequenced to confirm the anticipated mutation (University of North Carolina Genomic Analysis Facility). Expression and Purification of HS-2OST and CS-2OST Proteins—The expression plasmids for various mutants or wild type were carried out in Origami-B cells (Novagen) carrying pGro7 (Takara, Japan) plasmid expressing chaperonin proteins GroEL and GroES of Escherichia coli. Transformed cells were typically grown in 100 ml of LB medium supplemented with 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline, 15 μg/ml kanamycin, 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at 37 °C. When the A600 reached 0.4-0.7, isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside (at the final concentration of 0.15 mm) and l-arabinose (at the final concentration of 1 mg/ml) were added to induce the expression of HS-2OST (or CS 2-OST) and chaperonin proteins, respectively. Then the cells were allowed to shake overnight at 22 °C. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 8 ml of a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 30 mm imidazole. Cells were disrupted by sonication then spun down as described (20Edavettal S.C. Lee K.A. Negishi M. Linhardt R.J. Liu J. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25789-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the supernatant was applied to a 1-ml Ni-Sepharose 6 fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The purified proteins were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of imidazole from 30 to 300 mm in 15 ml. The purity of the resultant proteins was typically greater than 80% for HS-2OST and between 50 and 90% pure for CS-2OST as determined by 10% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad). About 0.5-2-liter cultures were used to obtain sufficient amount of proteins for the analysis by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) or 3′,5′-ADP (PAP)-agarose chromatography (Sigma). Expression and Purification of dmHs2st, pip-PA, and pip-PF—The expression vectors of dmHs2st, pip-PA, and pip-PF were prepared as described above. The purification method of dmHs2st is identical to that of HS-2OST, whereas MBP-pip-PA and MBP-pip-PF were purified using a method described previously (21Chen J. Avci F.Y. Muñoz E.M. McDowell L.M. Chen M. Pedersen L.C. Zhang L. Linhardt R.J. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42817-42825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Determination of the Sulfotransferase Activity—Sulfotransferase activity was determined by incubating 200 ng of purified mutant or wild type HS-2OST proteins with 10 μg of completely desulfated N-sulfated (CDSNS) heparin (gift from Dr. Linhardt, RPI) and 2-5 × 105 cpm of [35S]PAPS (10 μm) in 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mm MES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 5mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and quenched by the addition of 6 m urea and 100 mm EDTA. The sample was then subjected to a 200-μl DEAE-Sepharose chromatograph to purify the [35S]HS. The quantity of [35S]HS was then determined by liquid scintillation counting. The procedures determining the activity of CS-2OST were essentially identical to those of HS-2OST, except the substrate used in the assay is dermatan sulfate (porcine skin; Sigma). For substrate specificity measurement of HS-2OST and CS-2OST, the CDSNS heparin and the N-sulfoheparosan were pretreated with chondroitinase ABC, whereas the chondroitin sulfate A and C (Sigma) and dermatan sulfate were pretreated with heparin lyases in order to eliminate potential cross-contamination between heparin and chondroitin sulfates. Determination of the Binding Constant (KD) of HS-2OST to PAP by ITC—ITC was performed on a MicroCal VP-ITC. Solutions were cooled to 20 °C and degassed under vacuum before use. Experiments were conducted using 20-30 μm protein in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 100 mm arginine, and 100 mm glutamate at 20 °C. Titrations were performed by injecting 5 μl of 0.7 mm PAP (Sigma) in the same buffer. Data analysis was completed using Origin software. Determination of PAP Binding Affinity Using PAP Chromatography—PAP-agarose affinity chromatography was used to determine the binding affinity of the wild type and mutant proteins of CS-2OST to PAP using an AKTA-FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Approximately 300 μg of proteins in 5 ml of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.2, and 100 mm NaCl (buffer A) was loaded onto a PAP-agarose column (7 × 52 mm) pre-equilibrated with buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Unbound material was removed by washing with 8 ml of buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0.1 to 1.5 m in 15 ml, and the eluent was monitored by A280 nm. The NaCl concentration at the central position of the eluted CS-2OST peak was recorded as the elution concentration. Disaccharide Analysis of 2-O-[35S]HS—The 2-O-[35S]HS prepared from HS-2OST- and dmHs2st-modified HS was degraded with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 followed by reduction with sodium borohydride (22Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The disaccharides were resolved by a C18-reversed phase column (0.46 × 25 cm) (Vydac) under the reverse-phase ion-pairing HPLC (RPIP-HPLC) condition (23Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Colliec-Jouault S.

The identities of the disaccharides were determined by coeluting with appropriate 3H-labeled IdoUA2S-AnMan (23Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Colliec-Jouault S. Liu J. Mulligan R.C. Birinyi L.K. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24941-24952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where AnMan represents 2,5-anhydromannitol. The catalytic domains of HS-2OST and CS-2OST were expressed in E. coli. The substrate specificities of HS-2OST and CS-2OST were determined using five different polysaccharide substrates. As shown in Table 1, HS-2OST exhibited excellent activity toward CDSNS heparin (94.7 pmol/μg of substrate) and moderate activity toward N-sulfoheparosan (9.3 pmol/μg), although it showed no activity toward chondroitin sulfate A and C, and only trace amounts of activity toward chondroitin sulfate B (0.4 pmol/μg). CS-2OST showed the best activity toward chondroitin sulfate A (61.2 pmol/μg) and chondroitin sulfate B (31.1 pmol/μg) and moderate activity toward chondroitin sulfate C (16.9 pmol/μg), and it displayed only trace amounts of activity toward CDSNS heparin and N-sulfoheparosan. The structures of the disaccharide repeating unit of the polysaccharide substrates are shown in Fig. 1B. It is important to note that the observed CS-2OST substrate profile is largely consistent with the one described in a recent report where CS-2OST was expressed in COS-7 cells, observing that the chondroitin sulfate A is the best substrate among tested chondroitin/dermatan sulfates (17Ohtake S. Kimata K. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39115-39123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, our results showed that chondroitin sulfate B (dermatan sulfate) can also serve as a substrate for CS-2OST, which is consistent with another report on the substrate specificity of CS 2-OST expressed in insect cells (16Kobayashi M. Sugumaran G. Liu J. Shworak N.W. Silbert J.E. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10474-10480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results suggest that bacterially expressed recombinant proteins specifically transfer the sulfo group to the hexauronic acid that is linked to GlcNS residue (for HS-2OST) and GalNAc residue (for CS-2OST), respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 1A.TABLE 1Substrate specificities analysis of HS-2OST and CS-2OSTSubstratesaThe structures of the disaccharide repeating unit of the polysaccharide substrates are shown in Fig. 1B.Sulfate transferred by HS-2OSTSulfate transferred by CS-2OSTpmol/μgpmol/μgCDSNS heparin94.71.4N-Sulfoheparosan9.30.7Chondroitin sulfate A<0.161.2Chondroitin sulfate B0.431.1Chondroitin sulfate C<0.116.9a The structures of the disaccharide repeating unit of the polysaccharide substrates are shown in Fig. 1B. Open table in a new tab The PAP-binding Site of HS-2OST—Based on the structures of estrogen sulfotransferase (EST) and HS 3-OSTs, we built a homology model of HS-2OST (Fig. 2A). A set of amino acid residues in HS-2OST was identified to be involved in the hydrogen bonding with PAPS. The residues predicted to contribute to the binding to the 5′-phosphosulfate group of PAPS include the following: Lys83, Thr84, Ser86, and Thr87 (Fig. 2B). Each of these residues was then mutated to alanine to test how the mutations affected the enzymatic activity (Table 2). The mutants exhibited impaired activities but to different extents. The K83A and S86A mutations abolished the activity, whereas T87A and T84A show less potent but noticeable impairment to the activity. As expected, the mutant proteins do not bind to PAP as determined by ITC (Table 2), suggesting that the loss or significant impairment of the sulfotransferase activity is because of the decrease in the binding affinity to PAPS.TABLE 2Analysis of HS-2OST and CS-2OST mutants defective in PAPS bindingHS-2OST mutantsActivity levelExpression levelPAP KDCS-2OST mutantsActivity levelExpression levelPAP column elution salt concentration%%μm%%mmWT10010017.3 ± 1.9WT1001001100K83A<150NDaND indicates not detectable under the conditions used, usually has a KD value greater than 200 μm.K112A<130780T84A12 ± 250NDC113A15 ± 570690S86A<1100NDS115A<185820T87A6 ± 375NDR116A2 ± 185730R164A3 ± 2100NDR189A<1100630S172A7 ± 1100NDS197A7 ± 2110730a ND indicates not detectable under the conditions used, usually has a KD value greater than 200 μm. Open table in a new tab Residues involved in binding to the 3′-phosphate group of PAPS were identified to be Arg164 and Ser172 (Fig. 2B). The alanine mutants of these two residues showed significantly decreased enzymatic activity, and the binding affinity to PAP is abolished as determined by ITC. These results suggest that both Arg164 and Ser172 are involved in binding to PAPS. PAP is the product of sulfotransferase-catalyzed reactions. Because of the chemical instability of PAPS, we only measured binding affinity of the mutated HS-2OST to PAP, provided that this approach was used for characterizing 3-OST-1 (20Edavettal S.C. Lee K.A. Negishi M. Linhardt R.J. Liu J. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25789-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Km value of wild type HS-2OST toward PAPS was determined to be 18.5 μm, which is very close to the binding affinity to PAP (KD = 17.3 μm), suggesting that this approach is applicable to HS-2OST. PAPS-binding Site of CS-2OST—Because CS-2OST and HS-2OST have very homologous amino acid sequences, the residues involved in binding to the 5′-phosphosulfate in CS-2OST are believed to be those corresponding residues in HS-2OST as described above. The residues in CS-2OST include Lys112, Cys113, Ser115, and Arg116 (see Fig. 2B for the amino acid sequence alignment). The residues were mutated to alanine, and the mutants showed diminished sulfotransferase activity in a very similar pattern to that observed for the HS-2OST mutants (Table 2). Because the solubility of CS-2OST is low, we could not determine the binding affinity (KD) to PAP using ITC. Instead, we decided to estimate the binding affinity of the mutant to PAP using PAP-agarose affinity chromatography eluted with a concentration gradient of NaCl (20Edavettal S.C. Lee K.A. Negishi M. Linhardt R.J. Liu J. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25789-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All tested mutants were eluted from the PAP column at a lower concentration compared with the wild type protein (Table 2), suggesting that mutation at these residues decreased binding affinity to PAP. Both Arg189 and Ser197 are predicted to bind to the 3′-phosphate of PAPS based on the homology alignment (Fig. 2B). Indeed, mutants R189A and S197A displayed diminished enzymatic activity and reduced binding affinity to PAP (Table 2). It has been suggested that a catalytic base is beneficial for facilitating the deprotonation of the acceptor substrate to allow the sulfotransfer reaction to occur (24Negishi M. Pedersen L.G. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Gorokhov A. Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). A structural neighbor search of HS-2OST and CS-2OST through GenTHREADER (25McGuffin L.J. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2003; 19: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) reveals that the enzymes are structurally more similar to human EST than to HS 3-OSTs, especially in the β7 region of EST (Fig. 2B). Within this region, the catalytic base of EST, His107, aligns with His142 of HS-2OST and His168 of CS-2OST, suggesting that His142 and His168 may serve as a catalytic base for HS-2OST and CS-2OST, respectively. Indeed, His142 is conserved among all HS-2OST from different species and so is His168 in CS-2OST, suggesting that they are essential for enzymatic activities. His142 and His140 in HS-2OST—To address the role of His142 in HS-2OST, a H142A mutant was prepared. This mutant retained around 5% of the wild type HS-2OST activity rather than completely abolishing the activity (Table 3), suggesting other residues may be involved in the deprotonation step. Based on the homology model, His140 may also be located near the catalytic site and have a similar distance between the sulfo group of PAPS and the acceptor site His142 (as illustrated in Fig. 3). Further investigation found that the corresponding residue of EST, Lys105, has been suggested to play a role in the catalysis of EST (26Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Like His142, His140 in HS-2OST is also conserved across species, suggesting that this residue is critical for the sulfotransferase activity. An H140A mutant was prepared and exhibited about 4% of the WT HS-2OST activity (Table 3). To this end, a H140A/H142A double mutant was prepared, and indeed, this mutant resulted in a complete loss of HS-2OST activity (<1%) (Table 3). To rule out the possibility that His140 and His142 bind to PAPS, the mutants H140A, H142A, and H140A/H142A were subjected to ITC analysis. The result indicated that all of the mutants retained similar PAP binding affinity to that of WT HS-2OST protein (Table 3). Taken together, the results suggest that both histidines are important for the activity of HS-2OST.TABLE 3Analysis of HS-2OST and CS-2OST mutants defective in the catalytic functionHS-2OST MutantsActivity levelExpression levelPAP KDCS-2OST mutantsActivity levelExpression levelPAP column elution salt concentration%%μm%%mmWT10010017.3 ± 1.9WT1001001100H140A4 ± 112022.8 ± 1.5T166A10070NAaNA indicates not applicable.H142A5 ± 215013.8 ± 0.8R167A22 ± 270NAH140A/H142A<110024.6 ± 2.3H168A<11301180a NA indicates not applicable. Open table in a new tab Role of His168 in CS-2OST—The mutation at His168 in CS-2OST that corresponds to His107 in hEST resulted in a complete loss of sulfotransferase activity (Table 3). The binding affinity of H168A mutant to PAP was also estimated by subjecting to a PAP-affinity column. The mutant H168A and wild type CS-2OST eluted at similar salt concentrations suggesting they have very similar binding affinity for PAP. These results support the hypothesis that His168 is a potential catalytic base for the CS-2OST. Residues Thr166 and Arg167 that are proximate to His168 were also tested for contributions to catalysis because they align close to His140 in the sequence of HS-2OST. T166A and R167A displayed similar or moderately decreased sulfotransferase activity compa"

Recent evidence suggests that S6K1, rather than S6K2, controls cell growth (7Pende M. Um S.H. Mieulet V. Sticker M. Goss V.L. Mestan J. Mueller M. Fumagalli S. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). S6K1 is regulated by phosphorylation on multiple residues, including Thr-229 in the activation loop and Thr-389 within a conserved hydrophobic motif in the linker region (8Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp.

S6K1 is thought to facilitate protein translation by positively regulating the eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2) by phosphorylating and inhibiting eEF2 kinase (14Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N. Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 15Wang X. Proud C.G. Physiology. 2006; 21: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 acts as a platform to coordinate mTOR signaling with phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4EBP-1 and subsequent S6K1 phosphorylation of the 40 S ribosomal subunit S6 and eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (16Holz M.K. Ballif B.A. Gygi S.P. Blenis J. Cell. 2005; 123: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Although the physiological requirement for S 6 phosphorylation by S6K1 in protein synthesis remains unclear, its role in regulating cell size is well established (17Ruvinsky I. Sharon N. Lerer T. Cohen H. Stolovich-Rain M. Nir T. Dor Y. Zisman P. Meyuhas O. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2199-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). There has been substantial progress in defining the molecular mechanisms that control mTOR/S6K1 signaling. Most evident is the finding that the TSC gene products TSC1 and TSC2 function as GTPase-activating proteins for the small GTPase Rheb (18Avruch J. Lin Y. Long X. Murthy S. Ortiz-Vega S. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2005; 8: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In turn, Rheb binds mTOR directly and stimulates its kinase activity (19Long X. Ortiz-Vega S. Lin Y. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23433-23436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 20Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Yonezawa K. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). In addition, the energy-sensing serine/threonine kinase AMPK phosphorylates and activates TSC2, resulting in the inhibition of mTOR/S6K1 under conditions of low energy (21Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3034) Google Scholar). These findings collectively demonstrate that TSC1/TSC2, Rheb, and AMPK are upstream energy-sensing components in the mTOR/S6K1 pathway. The reversible tyrosyl phosphorylation of intracellular signaling pathways is a key mechanism regulating cell growth and cell cycle progression. Mitogenic stimuli that activate receptor tyrosine kinases that engage the PI3K/Akt pathway also regulate the mTOR/S6K1 pathway (3Richardson C.J. Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, receptor tyrosine kinases are implicated in the regulation of mTOR/S6K1. Whether protein tyrosine phosphatases are involved in the regulation of mTOR/S6K1, however, remains to be determined. A potential candidate protein tyrosine phosphatase for the regulation of the mTOR/S6K1 pathway is the SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, which contains two NH2-terminal SH2 domains and a COOH-terminal protein tyrosine phosphatase domain (reviewed in Ref. 22Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Multiple biochemical and genetic epistasis experiments have demonstrated that SHP-2 functions as a positive signal enhancer downstream of a number of receptor tyrosine kinases to regulate the Ras/Raf/ERK cascade (reviewed in Refs. 22Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 23Feng G.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). SHP-2 also has been shown to promote activation of the PI3K signaling cascade (24Zito C.I. Kontaridis M.I. Fornaro M. Feng G.S. Bennett A.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 199: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 25Zhang S.Q. Tsiaras W.G. Araki T. Wen G. Minichiello L. Klein R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell.

Hence, we speculated that SHP-2 might also be involved in the regulation of the S6K1 pathway. In this report we show that SHP-2 negatively regulates S6K1 activity and subsequently limits cell growth (accumulation of cell mass). Moreover, it appears that these effects are mediated by SHP-2 in a manner that is, at least in part, responsive to changes in energy status through AMPK. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—SHP-2+/+ and SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts have been described previously (24Zito C.I. Kontaridis M.I. Fornaro M. Feng G.S. Bennett A.M. J. Cell.

For immunoblotting, cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). All primary antibodies were used by first blocking Immobilon-P membranes with 5% nonfat dried milk or 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST (Tris-buffered saline Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.

S6K1 was immunoprecipitated using the C3 antibody (Dr. John Blenis, Harvard Medical School). All primary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were coupled to either anti-rabbit Ig horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey antibodies or anti-mouse Ig horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep antibodies and visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents from either Amersham Biosciences or PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cell Size Assays—Cells were collected, pelleted by centrifugation at 1,800 × g, and re-suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with either 0.1% or 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 5 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). Cell diameter was determined using a BD Biosciences Coulter Multisizer. Statistical significances were calculated by performing a two-tail t test assuming unequal variances. Adenoviral Infections and siRNA Transfections—Recombinant wild type (WT) and catalytically inactive (ΔP and RM) adenoviruses have been described previously (28Kontaridis M.I. Liu X. Zhang L. Bennett A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3875-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells were infected at 5–6 × 107 optical particle unit/1 × 106 cells. Synthetic siRNA duplexes were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO) and targeted the SHP-2 sequence 5′-CCCAAAAAGAGUUACAUUGCC-3′. The control siRNA is siCONTROL, a non-targeting siRNA (D-001210–01; Dharmacon). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with either 50 nm SHP-2 siRNA or siCONTROL using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 2 days, cells were growth factor-deprived for an additional 18–24 h before immunoblot analysis. Transient Transfections and Cell Sorting—Cells were transfected with pIRES, pIRES-SHP-2(myc), or pIRES-SHP-2-EA(myc) plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000. The next day, cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline before growth factor deprivation. After an additional 24 h, cells were collected by trypsinization and GFP-positive cells were sorted using a BD Biosciences flow cytometer. S6K1 in Vitro Kinase Assays—S6K1 was immunoprecipitated using the C3 antibody and protein A-Sepharose. Immune complexes were washed twice with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, once with STE (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA), and twice with kinase wash buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2). Kinase reactions were carried out using glutathione S-transferase-S6 as a substrate for 12 min at 30 °C in kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 ng/μl protein kinase A inhibitor, 50 μm ATP, 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP). Reactions were stopped by the addition of sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. SHP-2 Negatively Regulates S6K1 Activity—SHP-2 is required for the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (24Zito C.I. Kontaridis M.I. Fornaro M. Feng G.S. Bennett A.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 199: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 25Zhang S.Q. Tsiaras W.G. Araki T. Wen G. Minichiello L. Klein R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4062-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 26Wu C.J. O'Rourke D.M. Feng G.S. Johnson G.R. Wang Q. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6018-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 27Hakak Y. Hsu Y.S. Martin G.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3164-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that SHP-2 might play a role in PI3K-mediated signaling to positively regulate S6K1 activity and subsequently promote cell growth (cell size and cell mass). We first determined whether S6K1 activation is perturbed in SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts following stimulation with IGF-1. SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts contain a deletion within exon 3 of SHP-2 resulting in the truncation of the amino-terminal SH2 domain (29Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In all cases examined, SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts behave phenotypically as SHP-2 loss-of-function cells (22Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). S6K1 activation was assessed as a function of Thr-389 phosphorylation. As shown previously (24Zito C.I. Kontaridis M.I. Fornaro M. Feng G.S. Bennett A.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 199: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Wu C.J. O'Rourke D.M. Feng G.S. Johnson G.R. Wang Q. Greene M.I. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6018-6025Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts were inhibited in their ability to stimulate Akt and ERK activation in response to IGF-1 as compared with SHP-2+/+ fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). SHP-2+/+ fibroblasts induced S6K1 phosphorylation in response to IGF-1, as expected (Fig. 1A). In contrast, SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts appeared to be less responsive to IGF-1-induced S6K1 phosphorylation; this was presumably due to the observation that these cells had markedly higher levels of S6K1 phosphorylation under growth factor-deprived conditions as compared with SHP-2+/+ fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). This result was supported by immune complex S6K1 activity assays that also demonstrated that SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts exhibited increased S6K1 activity when growth factor-deprived (Fig. 1B). As expected, IGF-1-inducible S6K1 activity was sensitive to rapamycin in both SHP-2+/+ and SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts (Fig. 1B). Next, we examined S6K1 phosphorylation during G1 progression to establish the kinetics of S6K1 activation in SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 1C, SHP-2+/+ fibroblasts displayed a transient increase in S6K1 phosphorylation following IGF-1 stimulation. In SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts, S6K1 phosphorylation was elevated prior to IGF-1 stimulation (Fig. 1C). When SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts were released into G1 upon IGF-1 stimulation, S6K1 phosphorylation increased further and remained elevated throughout G1 (Fig. 1C). To further substantiate the argument that SHP-2 suppresses S6K1 phosphorylation under conditions of growth factor deprivation, the expression of SHP-2 was depleted using siRNA. Transfection of 3T3 fibroblasts with siRNA oligonucleotides reduced SHP-2 expression (Fig. 1D). Accordingly, SHP-2 siRNA-treated fibroblasts were impaired in their ability to activate ERK in response to IGF-1 stimulation (Fig. 1D). S6K1 phosphorylation in SHP-2 siRNA-treated fibroblasts under conditions of growth factor deprivation enhanced S6K1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). Collectively, these results demonstrate that SHP-2 negatively regulates S6K1 phosphorylation under conditions of growth factor deprivation and during G1 progression. SHP-2 Cooperates with mTOR in the Regulation of S6K1—To begin elucidating the pathways that link SHP-2 to the regulation of S6K1, we utilized the pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR, wortmannin and rapamycin, respectively. In Fig. 2, the enhanced levels of S6K1 phosphorylation in growth factor-deprived SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts as compared with SHP-2+/+ fibroblasts were inhibited by both wortmannin and rapamycin, whereas IGF-1 stimulation of Akt was inhibited by wortmannin but not rapamycin (Fig. 2). These results suggest that in growth factor-deprived cells SHP-2 lies upstream of, and/or parallel to, both PI3K and mTOR in the control of S6K1 phosphorylation. We next attempted to rescue the enhanced S6K1 phosphorylation in growth factor-deprived SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts. In Fig. 3A, we show that this defect could be rescued by re-introduction of wild type SHP-2 into SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts; S6K1 phosphorylation in wild type SHP-2 expressing SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts was reduced to levels that were undetectable as compared with GFP adenoviral infected control cells. In addition, expression of a constitutively active mutant of SHP-2 (SHP-2-E76A) into SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts also suppressed S6K1 activity relative to GFP control infectants under conditions of growth factor deprivation (Fig. 3A). These results support the interpretation that SHP-2 negatively regulates S6K1 in growth factor-deprived cells. To address whether SHP-2 inhibition of S6K1 phosphorylation in response to growth factor deprivation was a function of SHP-2 phosphatase activity, we infected 3T3 fibroblasts with recombinant adenoviruses expressing two distinct catalytically inactive mutants of SHP-2 that serve as dominant-negatives; SHP-2(ΔP) contains a deletion within the phosphatase domain (30Tang T.L. Freeman R.M. O'Reilly A.M. Neel B.G. Sokol S.Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 473-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and SHP-2(RM) is an Arg-495 to Met-495 mutation within the protein tyrosine phosphatase domain (31Kontaridis M.I. Eminaga S. Fornaro M. Zito C.I. Sordella R. Settleman J. Bennett A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5340-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Under conditions of growth factor deprivation, GFP control infected 3T3 fibroblasts exhibited low levels of S6K1 activity (Fig. 3B), whereas cells infected with either SHP-2(ΔP) or SHP-2(RM) had increased levels of S6K1 activity in growth factor-deprived fibroblasts to levels similar to that of IGF-1-inducible S6K1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that the catalytic activity of SHP-2 is necessary for the suppression of S6K1 under conditions of growth factor deprivation. SHP-2 Negatively Regulates Cell Size—S6K1 is a critical regulator of cell size (3Richardson C.J. Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 5Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3151-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 9Martin K.A. Blenis J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 86: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Because SHP-2 negatively regulates S6K1 phosphorylation we determined whether this resulted in an increase in the size of SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts. SHP-2+/+ and SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts were growth factor-deprived for 72 h, and cell size was determined. SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts were found to be larger in size than SHP-2+/+ fibroblasts as depicted by a rightward shift in the size distribution of these cells (Fig. 4A, left panel). Quantitation of these data showed that there was a significant increase, ∼10%, in the size of SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts as compared with SHP-2+/+ fibroblasts (Fig. 4A, right panel). Similar results were obtained under proliferating conditions (data not shown). We next sought to demonstrate that the increased cell size of SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts was due specifically to the loss of functional SHP-2. SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts were transfected with GFP control, GFP-SHP-2 (WT), or GFP-SHP-2 (EA). Growth factor-deprived GFP-positive SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts were collected by cell sorting using flow cytometry, and the diameter of those cells was analyzed. SHP-2 (WT) and SHP-2 (EA) were expressed to equivalent levels (Fig. 4B). Expression of SHP-2 (WT) in SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts resulted in a reduction in cell size as compared with GFP control-expressing cells (Fig. 4B). Additionally, SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts expressing the constitutively active mutant of SHP-2 (EA) exhibited a more pronounced decrease in cell size as compared with SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts expressing SHP-2 (WT) (Fig. 4B). Next, we used rapamycin to test whether the increased cell size of SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts was dependent upon the activity of mTOR. These results showed that rapamycin significantly attenuated the increased cell size in SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts (Fig. 4C), arguing that SHP-2 negatively regulates cell size either upstream of, and/or parallel to, mTOR. Consistent with the larger size of SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts (Fig. 4), we found that these cells had significantly increased levels of protein content per cell as compared with SHP-2+/+ fibroblasts (Fig. 5A). In mammalian cells, protein synthesis is regulated through the eukaryotic initiation factors and elongation factors (eEFs). Phosphorylation of eEF2 by eEF2 kinase leads to its inhibition, whereas dephosphorylation of eEF2 correlates with an increase in its activity and an increase in protein translation (14Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N. Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 15Wang X. Proud C.G. Physiology. 2006; 21: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 32Proud C.G. Wang X. Patel J.V. Campbell L.E. Kleijn M. Li W. Browne G.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S6K1 promotes protein translation by phosphorylating eEF2 kinase, resulting in its inactivation and thus promoting eEF2 activation (8Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 14Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N. Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 15Wang X. Proud C.G. Physiology. 2006; 21: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). We utilized a phospho-specific antibody to examine eEF2 activity. Dephosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr-56 correlates with its increased protein translation activity (33Marin P. Nastiuk K.L. Daniel N. Girault J.-A. Czernik A.J. Glowinski J. Nairn A.C. Premont J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts displayed markedly reduced levels of eEF2 phosphorylation throughout G1 in response to IGF-1 as compared with SHP2+/+ fibroblasts. Collectively, these data indicate that SHP-2 negatively regulates S6K1 activity and subsequently the activity of eEF2. SHP-2 Is Required for AMPK-dependent Suppression of S6K1—Energy sensing is mediated through the actions of the 5′-AMPK that is activated in response to reduced energy availability (34Kahn B.B. Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar, 35Carling D. Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Growth factor deprivation results in the depletion of cellular ATP and hence an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio (36Gottlieb E. Armour S.M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12801-12806Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). AMPK when activated by an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio phosphorylates TSC2, enhancing its GTPase activity, thereby inhibiting mTOR/S6K1 (21Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3034) Google Scholar, 37Kimura N. Tokunaga C. Dalal S. Richardson C. Yoshino K. Hara K. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Mimura O. Yonezawa K. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 38Bolster D.R. Crozier S.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23977-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that under conditions of growth factor deprivation SHP-2 promotes AMPK activity and subsequently inactivation of S6K1. AMPKα activity levels were assessed by measuring the phosphorylation status of its regulatory T-loop phosphorylation site (Thr-172) (39Crute B.E. Seefeld K. Gamble J. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35347-35354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) in SHP-2Ex3–/– and SHP-2+/+ fibroblasts. Under conditions of growth factor deprivation (lowered energy status), AMPK phosphorylation in SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts was found to be markedly lower as compared with SHP-2+/+ fibroblasts (Fig. 6A). AMPK phosphorylation was stimulated in SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts upon treatment with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR) which activates AMPK in an LKB1-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). Significantly, AICAR treatment suppressed the enhanced level of S6K1 phosphorylation in SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts (Fig. 6B). These results support the interpretation that SHP-2 promotes AMPK activity, providing a potential link between SHP-2 and its ability to suppress S6K1. S6K1 is a major effector of mTOR, and mice lacking S6K1 are reduced in size at birth (40Kozma S.C. Thomas G. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 41Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrating a role of S6K1 in the regulation of cell and organism size. We have found that SHP-2 suppresses S6K1 activity under conditions of growth factor deprivation in SHP-2 loss-of-function fibroblasts and by knock down of SHP-2 expression in fibroblasts by siRNA. Further, the enhanced level of S6K1 activity was rescued by re-introduction of wild type SHP-2 into SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts. Importantly, we show that under conditions of growth factor deprivation overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-2 was sufficient to enhance S6K1 activity. During G1 progression S6K1 activity was also enhanced in SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts, suggesting that SHP-2 negatively regulates S6K1 during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Consistent with these observations we found that SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts were larger in size than wild type fibroblasts. Together, these results demonstrate that SHP-2 functions to attenuate cell size by limiting S6K1 activity in growth factor-deprived cells and during cell cycle progression. The observation that SHP-2 suppresses S6K1 activity was somewhat surprising because we and others have shown that SHP-2 is required for activation of the PI3K pathway (24Zito C.I. Kontaridis M.I. Fornaro M. Feng G.S. Bennett A.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 199: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 25Zhang S.Q. Tsiaras W.G. Araki T. Wen G. Minichiello L. Klein R. Neel B.G. Mol.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3164-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that promotes S6K1 activation. However, the enhanced levels of S6K1 activity were inhibited by wortmannin. It remains possible that a wortmannin-sensitive PI3K family member might contribute to the regulation of S6K1 downstream of SHP-2. In this regard, it has been shown that mTOR signaling by amino acids can be mediated by the class 3 PI3K family member hVps34 (42Nobukuni T. Joaquin M. Roccio M. Dann S.G. Kim S.Y. Gulati P. Byfield M.P. Backer J.M. Natt F. Bos J.L. Zwartkruis F.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14238-14243Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 43Byfield M.P. Murray J.T. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33076-33082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Whether SHP-2 regulates hVps34 signaling in the control of nutrient and/or energy-sensing activation of S6K1 remains to be determined. SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts were found to be significantly larger in size as compared with wild type fibroblasts. Rapamycin rescued this defect, providing support for the assignment of SHP-2 acting either upstream of, and/or parallel to, mTOR. SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts contained increased levels of protein/cell as compared with wild type fibroblasts, consistent with the enhanced S6K1 activity and increased activity of eEF2 (14Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N. Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 32Proud C.G. Wang X. Patel J.V. Campbell L.E. Kleijn M. Li W. Browne G.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Marin P. Nastiuk K.L. Daniel N. Girault J.-A. Czernik A.J. Glowinski J. Nairn A.C. Premont J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the interpretation that under growth factor-deprived conditions SHP-2 limits protein translation by inhibiting S6K1. Because the elongation step in protein translation consumes a large amount of energy, suppression of S6K1 activity by SHP-2 under conditions of growth factor deprivation (where energy levels are low) would retard elongation and thus save energy. Both S6K1 and SHP-2 are required for cell cycle progression (4Fingar D.C. Richardson C.J. Tee A.R. Cheatham L. Tsou C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 200-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 44Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). When cells proliferate, cell size must be strictly maintained, and once a cell has “registered” its correct size, further growth is attenuated (2Stocker H. Hafen E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Failure to regulate cell growth coordinately with cell cycle progression is critical for faithful cell division. Interestingly, SHP-2 is uncoupled from its positive signaling effects to ERK late in G1 (44Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Therefore, SHP-2 might serve to limit cell growth by suppressing S6K1 activity at the later stages of G1 as part of a temporally distinct signaling pathway (independent of ERK) during cell proliferation. We also found that a constitutively active mutant of SHP-2 had a more potent effect in rescuing the increased cell size in SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts than wild type SHP-2. This suggests that the catalytic activity of SHP-2 is sufficient to suppress cell size. Consistent with this we have observed that fibroblasts derived from mice harboring the Noonan syndrome-associated mutation D61G in which SHP-2 is constitutively active (45Araki T. Mohi M.G. Ismat F.A. Bronson R.T. Williams I.R. Kutok J.L. Yang W. Pao L.I. Gilliland D.G. Epstein J.A. Neel B.G. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) also appear to be smaller than wild type fibroblasts (data not shown). Provocatively, the D61G Noonan syndrome knock-in mice (45Araki T. Mohi M.G. Ismat F.A. Bronson R.T. Williams I.R. Kutok J.L. Yang W. Pao L.I. Gilliland D.G. Epstein J.A. Neel B.G. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), as well as patients harboring Noonan syndrome-associated SHP-2-activating mutations, exhibit proportionate short stature. Whether the mTOR/S6K1-signaling axis is disrupted in Noonan syndrome-associated SHP-2 mutant mice requires further investigation. Our data reveal a potential link through which SHP-2 negatively regulates S6K1. It has been shown that AMPK activity inhibits S6K1 via direct phosphorylation of TSC2 (21Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3034) Google Scholar). AMPK, which is regulated by changes in the AMP:ATP ratio (34Kahn B.B. Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar, 35Carling D. Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), is reduced in its level of phosphorylation in SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts as compared with wild type cells when growth factor levels are low. Given that growth factor deprivation results in the depletion of cellular energy (36Gottlieb E. Armour S.M. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12801-12806Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), our results implicate a role for SHP-2 in energy sensing. How SHP-2 serves to sense energy changes is unclear; SHP-2 has been found to be expressed in mitochondria, suggesting a potential role for SHP-2 in the management of energy status (46Salvi M. Stringaro A. Brunati A.M. Agostinelli E. Arancia G. Clari G. Toninello A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. (CMLS). 2004; 61: 2393-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Treatment of SHP-2Ex3–/– fibroblasts with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside rescues the enhanced S6K activity, demonstrating that SHP-2 is unlikely to be controlling AMPK in a LKB1-dependent manner, consistent with the current perception that LKB1 does not appear to be regulated. S6K1 activates eEF2 kinase by direct phosphorylation. eEF2 kinase then phosphorylates and inactivates eEF2 (14Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N. Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 32Proud C.G. Wang X. Patel J.V. Campbell L.E. Kleijn M. Li W. Browne G.J. Biochem. Soc.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of SHP-2, eEF2 phosphorylation is reduced, which supports the interpretation that SHP-2 attenuates protein translation. These data are also in line with the observation that AMPK phosphorylates and activates eEF2 kinase (47Browne G.J. Finn S.G. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12220-12231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In light of our recent findings that demonstrate that SHP-2 regulates Ca2+ signaling (48Uhlen P.

However, we cannot rule out the possibility that SHP-2 might also regulate mTOR/S6K1 signaling via an AMPK-independent mechanism. Further studies will be required to fully define the mechanism of SHP-2 signaling in the energy-sensing pathway. In particular, it will be important to understand how SHP-2 activity is regulated by changes in energy status and subsequently the substrates dephosphorylated by SHP-2 in this pathway. In summary, we define a novel function for SHP-2 in the regulation of S6K1 signaling whereby SHP-2 acts to coordinate the early signaling events involved in the regulation of macromolecular biosynthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2122268747,"Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) is a key cytosolic enzyme in the salvage pathway for dTTP synthesis. In mitotic exit, human TK1 (hTK1) is degraded via the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)-Cdh1 pathway to limit dTTP production. In this study, we show that thymidine binding stabilizes hTK1 during growth arrest. By in vitro degradation, ubiquitination, and Cdh1 binding analyses, we provide direct evidence that thymidine binding protects wild-type hTK1 protein from APC/C-Cdh1-mediated destruction. In contrast, mutant-type hTK1 protein defective in thymidine binding ability could still be polyubiquitinated by APC/C-Cdh1 in the presence of thymidine. These results suggest that the status of thymidine binding to hTK1 protein determines its susceptibility to degradation due to APC/C targeting. Our in vivo experimental data also demonstrated that thymidine treatment abolished Cdh1/proteasome-responsive suppression of hTK1 expression. Moreover, exposure of mitotic-arrested K562 cells to thymidine (100 microM) stabilized endogenous TK1, causing nucleotide imbalance in the early G1 phase and an increase of S phase accumulation. In conclusion, thymidine is not only a substrate of TK1 but also acts as its expression regulator by modulating its proteolytic control during mitotic exit, conferring a feed-forward regulation of dTTP formation."
