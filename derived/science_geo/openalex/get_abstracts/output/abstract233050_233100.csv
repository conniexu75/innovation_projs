https://openalex.org/W2071202857,"Fruit flies are attracted by a diversity of odors that signal the presence of food, potential mates, or attractive egg-laying sites. Most Drosophila olfactory neurons express two types of odorant receptor genes: Or83b, a broadly expressed receptor of unknown function, and one or more members of a family of 61 selectively expressed receptors. While the conventional odorant receptors are highly divergent, Or83b is remarkably conserved between insect species. Two models could account for Or83b function: it could interact with specific odor stimuli independent of conventional odorant receptors, or it could act in concert with these receptors to mediate responses to all odors. Our results support the second model. Dendritic localization of conventional odorant receptors is abolished in Or83b mutants. Consistent with this cellular defect, the Or83b mutation disrupts behavioral and electrophysiological responses to many odorants. Or83b therefore encodes an atypical odorant receptor that plays an essential general role in olfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2059275312,"Adipocytes hold the body's major energy reserve as triacylglycerols packaged in large lipid droplets. Perilipins, the most abundant proteins on these lipid droplets, play a critical role in facilitating both triacylglycerol storage and hydrolysis. The stimulation of lipolysis by β-adrenergic agonists triggers rapid phosphorylation of perilipin and translocation of hormone-sensitive lipase to the surfaces of lipid droplets and more gradual fragmentation and dispersion of micro-lipid droplets. Because few lipid droplet-associated proteins have been identified in adipocytes, we isolated lipid droplets from basal and lipolytically stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and identified the component proteins by mass spectrometry. Structural proteins identified in both preparations include perilipin, S3-12, vimentin, and TIP47; in contrast, adipophilin, caveolin-1, and tubulin selectively localized to droplets in lipolytically stimulated cells. Lipid metabolic enzymes identified in both preparations include hormone-sensitive lipase, lanosterol synthase, NAD(P)-dependent steroid dehydrogenase-like protein, acyl-CoA synthetase, long chain family member (ACSL) 1, and CGI-58. 17-β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, type 7, was identified only in basal preparations, whereas ACSL3 and 4 and two short-chain reductase/dehydrogenases were identified on droplets from lipolytically stimulated cells. Additionally, both preparations contained FSP27, ribophorin I, EHD2, diaphorase I, and ancient ubiquitous protein. Basal preparations contained CGI-49, whereas lipid droplets from lipolytically stimulated cells contained several Rab GTPases and tumor protein D54. A close association of mitochondria with lipid droplets was suggested by the identification of pyruvate carboxylase, prohibitin, and a subunit of ATP synthase in the preparations. Thus, adipocyte lipid droplets contain specific structural proteins as well as lipid metabolic enzymes; the structural reorganization of lipid droplets in response to the hormonal stimulation of lipolysis is accompanied by increases in the relative mass of several proteins and the recruitment of additional proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2158226583,"Learning and memory depend on dendritic spine actin assembly and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an essential n-3 (omega-3) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PFA). High DHA consumption is associated with reduced Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, yet mechanisms and therapeutic potential remain elusive. Here, we report that reduction of dietary n-3 PFA in an AD mouse model resulted in 80%–90% losses of the p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the postsynaptic actin-regulating protein drebrin, as in AD brain. The loss of postsynaptic proteins was associated with increased oxidation, without concomitant neuron or presynaptic protein loss. N-3 PFA depletion increased caspase-cleaved actin, which was localized in dendrites ultrastructurally. Treatment of n-3 PFA-restricted mice with DHA protected against these effects and behavioral deficits and increased antiapoptotic BAD phosphorylation. Since n-3 PFAs are essential for p85-mediated CNS insulin signaling and selective protection of postsynaptic proteins, these findings have implications for neurodegenerative diseases where synaptic loss is critical, especially AD."
https://openalex.org/W2017650269,"We have used rat cDNA microarrays to identify adipocyte-specific genes that could play an important role in adipocyte differentiation or function. Here, we report the cloning and identification of a 2.0-kb mRNA coding for a putative protein that we have designated as desnutrin. The novel gene is expressed predominantly in adipose tissue, and its expression is induced early during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Desnutrin mRNA levels were regulated by the nutritional status of animals, being transiently induced during fasting. In vitro desnutrin gene expression was up-regulated by dexamethasone in a dose-dependent manner but not by cAMP, suggesting that glucocorticoids could mediate the increase in desnutrin mRNA levels observed during fasting. Desnutrin mRNA codes for a 486-amino acid putative protein containing a patatin-like domain, characteristic of many plant acyl hydrolases belonging to the patatin family. Confocal microscopy of enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged desnutrin protein-transfected cells showed that the fusion protein localized in the cytoplasm. Moreover, cells overexpressing desnutrin by transfection showed an increase in triglyceride hydrolysis. Interestingly, we also found that the desnutrin gene expression level was lower in ob/ob and db/db obese mouse models. Overall, our data suggest that the newly identified desnutrin gene codes for an adipocyte protein that may function as a lipase and play a role in the adaptive response to a low energy state, such as fasting, by providing fatty acids to other tissues for oxidation. In addition, decreased expression of desnutrin in obesity models suggests its possible contribution to the pathophysiology of obesity.

Triglycerides serve as the most efficient form of energy storage in times of caloric excess in many organisms. During periods of energy demand, triglycerides can be rapidly mobilized by the hydrolytic action of lipases, releasing free fatty acids that are oxidized to meet the energy requirement of the organism. In mammals, adipose tissue serves as the major lipid storage site. Whereas white adipose tissue (WAT) 1The abbreviations used are: WAT, white adipose tissue; BAT, brown adipose tissue; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; EST, expressed sequence tag; contig, group of overlapping clones; HA, hemagglutinin; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; MIX, methylisobutylxanthine; C/EBP, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein. stores triglycerides that can be mobilized, producing fatty acids to be used by peripheral tissues, brown adipose tissue (BAT) itself uses the accumulated lipids to generate heat, a process known as adaptative thermogenesis (1Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). In addition, WAT plays an important role as an endocrine organ, secreting a wide variety of factors that are involved in various aspects of physiology, including appetite control, peripheral metabolism, immune response, and vascular function (2Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar, 3MacDougald O.A. Mandrup S. Trends Endocrinol.

Physiol. 2001; 280: E827-E847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of adipose tissue is dependent on the energy requirements and is tightly controlled by nutrient, neural, and hormonal signals. The crucial contribution of adipose tissue to the energy metabolism and function of an organism is manifested by pathological conditions in which dysregulation of adipose function leads to the development of severe diseases such as insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease (5Unger R.H. Orci L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The adipocyte is the main cell type present in adipose tissue. During adipose tissue development, precursor cells differentiate to generate adipocytes fully equipped with the enzymatic machinery and regulatory proteins that are needed to carry out their function in controlling fat metabolism and energy homeostasis. The adipogenic process entails dramatic morphological and biochemical changes and alteration in the expression of hundreds of genes (6Burton G.R. Nagarajan R. Peterson C.A. McGehee Jr., R.E. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 329: 167-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Guo X. Liao K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 251: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 8Sadowski H.B. Wheeler T.T. Young D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4722-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This includes increases in the expression of genes involved in the specialized role of adipose tissue in lipid metabolism, hormone responsiveness, the extracellular matrix, and secretion of endocrine and regulatory factors (2Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). Moreover, some of the genes are expressed only in adipose tissue and constitute a unique functional trait of this tissue. Identification of such genes or gene products is of crucial importance in unraveling the regulatory mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation and function. It is also a requirement for fully understanding the etiology of the pathologies associated with adipose tissue malfunction. To identify novel genes that have a role in adipocyte differentiation or function, we have used several approaches based on differential gene expression. By differential screening and differential display techniques using the adipogenic 3T3-L1 cell line and primary preadipocytes, we previously cloned two regulatory proteins involved in the control of adipocyte differentiation, Pref-1 (9Smas C.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11252-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), an adipocyte-specific secreted factor that inhibits adipocyte differentiation in vitro and in vivo (12Kim K.-H.

Here, we report the cloning and identification of the full-length cDNA coding for a putative protein that we named desnutrin. This novel gene is induced early during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and is expressed predominantly in adipose tissue. Desnutrin mRNA levels are under the control of the nutritional status of animals, being transiently induced during fasting. In vitro, desnutrin gene expression was regulated by dexamethasone, but not by cAMP, suggesting that glucocorticoids could mediate the increase in desnutrin mRNA during fasting. Desnutrin mRNA codes for a 486-amino acid protein containing a patatin-like domain, characteristic of many plant acyl hydrolases that belong to the patatin family. We found that ectopic overexpression of desnutrin increased triglyceride hydrolysis in the cell, suggesting the function of desnutrin as a lipase and its role in the adaptive response of adipose tissue to the low energy state of fasting, releasing substrates for oxidation to meet the energy requirement for other tissues. Genefilter Microarray Analysis—Identification of genes expressed exclusively in adipose tissue was achieved by comparing the gene expression patterns of different mouse tissues using rat Genefilter membranes (Research Genetics) as described previously (12Kim K.-H. Lee K. Moon Y.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11252-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Briefly, filters were hybridized with 33P-labeled cDNAs synthesized by reverse transcription using 5 μg of total RNA from WAT, brain, muscle, and liver. Only those spots found exclusively in filters hybridized with WAT cDNAs were further analyzed. Cloning of Desnutrin cDNA and 3′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)—A BLASTn search (15Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) conducted using the identified rat expressed sequence tag (EST) clone sequence (GenBank™/EBI accession number AI059513) as a query in the mouse genome data base of NCBI revealed a single match located on the mouse chromosome 7 contig. The gene was identified as the 0610039C21Riken gene, and from now on, we will refer to it as desnutrin. The corresponding annotated mRNA sequence of the 0610039C21Riken gene (accession number NM_025802) was used to design PCR primers for cloning the cDNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame. Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA from WAT was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) in a total volume of 20 μl. Two μl of the reaction was used as the template, and desnutrin partial cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GACAGCGTCTCCGCCTCCGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GACAGGATCTTGTTCCACCCC-3′ (reverse). The 1634-bp PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega), and the insert fragment was fully sequenced. We performed 3′-RACE to obtain the 3′-end of desnutrin cDNA using the desnutrin-specific primer 5′-TGTCCTTCACCATCCGCTTGTTG-3′, oligo(dT), and WAT cDNA as the template. PCR was carried out for 35 cycles of denaturation (at 95 °C for 45 s), annealing (at 42 °C for 45 s), and extension (at 72 °C for 1 min). The resulting fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T-Easy vector and sequenced. Construction of Plasmids—To obtain a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged desnutrin expression vector, PCR was carried out using the cDNA containing the entire coding region (described above) as the template and primers 5′-CGCGGAGACCCCAAGGTATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTACAAGCTGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAGCAAGGCGGGAGGCCAGGTGGATCCTGTGGGGT-3′ (reverse). The PCR fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T-Easy vector and then subcloned into the NotI site of the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) for mammalian expression. A fusion protein construct bearing the coding region of desnutrin was prepared by subcloning a reverse transcription-PCR product of desnutrin into the pEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences) in-frame with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Briefly, PCR was performed using 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNA as the template and primers 5′-TCCGGACTCAGATCTATGTTCCCGAGGGAGACCAAGTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGTACCGTCGACTGCAAGCTGTAATCTGGAACATC-3′ (reverse). The PCR product was purified on agarose gel, digested with BglII and SalI, and cloned into the BglII/SalI sites of the pEGFP-N1 vector. Animals—For tissue distribution of desnutrin mRNA and its regulation by fasting and refeeding, male C57BL/6 mice were used. In the fasting/refeeding experiments, mice were fasted for a period of up to 48 h, after which they were killed, and tissues were extracted for RNA analysis. Mice were refed a high carbohydrate diet for 12 h after 48 h of fasting before being killed. Desnutrin mRNA levels was also determined by reverse transcription-PCR and Northern blot analysis in gonadal adipose tissue obtained from ob/ob and db/db male mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) fasted for 12 h. Separation of the Stromal Vascular Fraction and Adipocytes of WAT—Inguinal WAT from mice was isolated, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and minced prior to digestion with 2 mg/ml collagenase and 2% bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Digestion was carried out for 20–30 min at 37 °C under constant agitation until tissue integrity was disrupted. The cell suspension was filtered through a 70-μm mesh filter to remove undigested tissue fragments, and mature adipocytes were separated from the stromal vascular fraction by flotation. The stromal vascular fraction was collected with a syringe, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. Cells were immediately processed for RNA extraction. Cell Culture and Transfection—3T3-L1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% calf serum. To induce differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes, 2-day post-confluent preadipocytes (day 0) were treated with 1 μm dexamethasone (DEX) and 0.5 μm methylisobutylxanthine (MIX) for 48 h. After the induction period, cells were switched to differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum) and maintained for 5–7 days, at which point 90% of the cells exhibited the typical adipocyte morphology. For the experiments examining the effect of glucocorticoids on desnutrin expression, confluent preadipocytes were treated with dexamethasone, MIX, dibutyryl cAMP, or dexamethasone/MIX at the concentrations indicated. COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfection of COS-7 cells with desnutrin-EGFP or HA-desnutrin expression vectors was carried out by the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method as described previously (16Gulick T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from mouse tissues or cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Northern blot analysis, 5–15 μg of total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on formaldehyde-containing 1.2% agarose gel and transferred onto Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Blot hybridization was carried out in ExpressHyb solution (Clontech) using 32P-labeled cDNA-specific probes for desnutrin, adiponutrin, fatty-acid synthase, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aFABP/aP2), CAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. Confocal Microscopy—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with desnutrin-EGFP (0.7 μg of DNA) as described above and grown on glass coverslips. Thirty-six h post-transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The samples were briefly equilibrated with PBS, and nuclei were counterstained with 0.3 μm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes) for 3–4 min. The samples were rinsed several times with PBS and mounted on glass microscope slides using Antifade and Prolong mounting media (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As a positive control, the empty pEGFP-N1 vector expressing only EGFP was used. Images were captured using a Zeiss 510 UV-visible laser scanning confocal microscope. Subcellular Fractionation by Differential Centrifugation and Western Blot Analysis—COS-7 cells transfected with an expression vector for HA-tagged desnutrin were washed three times with PBS and twice with 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm triethanolamine, and 10 mm acetic acid (pH 7.8). Cells were harvested in ice-cold 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm acetic acid, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.8) and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. The crude nuclear fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min to obtain the mitochondrial fraction, and the resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate the microsomal fraction from the cytosolic fraction. Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) for immunodetection using anti-HA antibody (Covance). Separation of Lipids from Transfected COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were transfected with the HA-desnutrin expression vector or the control pcDNA3.1 vector as described above. Thirty-six h post-transfection, cells were incubated for 4 h in serum-free medium (DMEM) containing fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml) and [U-14C]palmitic acid (final volume of 0.1 μCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences). Cells were washed with PBS and harvested for lipid extraction (time 0) or further incubated with serum-containing medium for an additional 4, 8, and 16 h. Lipids from cells and media were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (17Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) and separated by TLC using solvent system A (hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:2)) to resolve neutral lipids or solvent system B (chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide/water (65:35:5: 1)) to separate polar lipids. Radioactive lipids were detected by autoradiography. To measure the radiolabeled lipids released to the media by cells, 1 ml of cell culture medium was collected at the end of each time point and mixed with 20 ml of CytoScint (Fisher), and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Cloning of Full-length Mouse Desnutrin cDNA—We performed microarray analysis using EST cDNA filter microarrays to identify those genes expressed exclusively in adipose tissue. We compared the gene expression patterns in brain, muscle, liver, and adipose tissue using rat EST cDNA arrays and identified a set of genes that showed signal only on the arrays that were hybridized with WAT cDNAs. Candidate EST clones were sequenced, and adipose tissue-specific expression was verified by Northern blot analysis using RNA from liver, brain, muscle, and WAT (data not shown). One of these clones showed exclusive expression in WAT. Using the 434-bp sequence of the selected EST clone (GenBank™/EBI accession number AI059513) as a query, the BLASTn search of the mouse genome data base of NCBI identified a single match on the 3′-region of the 0610039C21Riken gene, located in chromosome 7. We used the sequence of the annotated 0610039C21Riken gene mRNA (accession number NM_025802) for the design of a set of primers to amplify the coding region of the gene using mouse cDNA reverse-transcribed with RNA prepared from WAT. In addition, the 3′-end was further characterized by carrying out 3′-RACE. A total of nine amplification products were sequenced, and the resulting consensus 3′-end sequence was used for PCR to generate the full-length desnutrin cDNA of 1965 bp (Fig. 1). Desnutrin encodes a protein with a length of 486 amino acids and an estimated molecular mass of 53.6 kDa. The cDNA contains a short 5′-untranslated region of 80 bases and a long 3′-untranslated region of 426 bases with a single polyadenylation signal (Fig. 1). The homology search revealed the presence of related proteins in a wide range of organisms, including animals and plants. In humans, two proteins with a high degree of homology (88%) to desnutrin have been identified. These proteins, named TTS2.2 (GenBank™/EBI accession number CAC01132) and TTS2.1 (accession number CAC01131), appear to be distinct proteins and have been implicated in the vesicular transport and secretion of the ICAM-3 (intercellular adhesion molecule-3) cell-surface receptor. In addition, two other putative human proteins sharing high homology with desnutrin have been identified: GS2-like protein (accession number NP_620169) and the hypothetical chromosome 22 open reading frame (accession number NP_079501). In mouse, two homologous proteins can be found: a hypothetical protein (accession number XP_128189) that appears to be the mouse homolog of the human GS2-like protein and adiponutrin. Adiponutrin has been recently cloned (18Baulande S. Lasnier F. Lucas M. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33336-33344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) as an adipose tissue-specific protein whose expression is up-regulated during adipocyte differentiation, but down-regulated during fasting in mice. Two homologous proteins are found in Drosophila melanogaster and four in Caenorhabditis elegans. Interestingly, additional putative proteins sharing some degree of homology are present in Arabidopsis thaliana, such as the protein At1g33270 (accession number NP_977474), and in prokaryotes, including Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (accession number NP_809687) and Bacillus subtilis (accession number NP_389387). The presence of desnutrin homologs and other related proteins in such a variety of organisms suggests that desnutrin belongs to a family of proteins whose members are widely expressed in all organisms, and this points toward a basic function of these proteins that is not exclusive of higher organisms. Desnutrin mRNA Is Expressed Predominantly in Adipose Tissue—Northern blot analysis was performed to determine the expression pattern of desnutrin in various types of mouse tissues. Hybridization of mouse RNAs with a desnutrin probe spanning nucleotides 20–1632 revealed a single mRNA of ∼2.0 kb in size (Fig. 2A). The appearance of a single band is in agreement with the presence of a single polyadenylation signal in the desnutrin cDNA sequence. Considering the average poly(A) length, we conclude that our desnutrin cDNA sequence represents full-length cDNA. As shown in Fig. 2A, desnutrin mRNA was highly expressed in various depots of WAT as well as BAT. Low but detectable desnutrin levels were also found in other tissues such as heart and testis, whereas desnutrin mRNA was found at a very low, barely detectable level in liver, spleen, thymus, kidney, brain, skeletal muscle, and lung. Therefore, although ubiquitously expressed, desnutrin is highly expressed in adipose tissues only. It is interesting to note that the desnutrin expression levels differed depending on the type or location of adipose tissue. Overall, BAT showed higher desnutrin mRNA levels than WAT. Among the white adipose depots, gonadal fat showed the highest level of expression compared with inguinal and renal WAT. Adiponutrin, a closely related gene known to be expressed exclusively in adipose tissue, showed a pattern of expression similar to that of desnutrin in the different adipose depots, with a higher level of expression in BAT and gonadal WAT (Fig. 2A). We next examined desnutrin gene expression in gonadal fat from the genetically obese mouse models ob/ob and db/db by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2B) as well as by reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). We observed ∼50% lower desnutrin mRNA levels in db/db mice and 80% lower levels in ob/ob mice compared with wild-type C57BL/6 mice, suggesting a possible significance of desnutrin function in obesity. To identify the cell type that is responsible for the high expression level of desnutrin mRNA in adipose tissue, cellular components of inguinal WAT were fractionated into adipocytes and a stromal vascular fraction containing preadipocytes as well as endothelial cells and resident macrophages. As shown in Fig. 2C (left panels), the desnutrin transcript was not detected in the stromal vascular fraction, but was found exclusively in the adipocyte fraction, along with adipocyte markers such as fatty-acid synthase, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein/aP2, C/EBPα, and adiponutrin. The adipocyte-specific expression of desnutrin mRNA was corroborated in 3T3-L1 cells, an established cell line that can be induced to differentiate into adipocytes upon appropriate hormone treatment and used as a model system for adipogenesis. Desnutrin mRNA was found only in mature adipocytes, but not in proliferating or confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Fig. 2C, right panels). We next examined desnutrin gene expression during the course of conversion of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes. As predicted and shown in Fig. 3, desnutrin mRNA was not detected in preadipocytes (day 0). However, its expression was rapidly increased when cells were induced to differentiate. The maximal level of desnutrin mRNA was reached after 6 days, when cells were fully differentiated into adipocytes, as judged by accumulation of lipids and expression of adipocyte markers such adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein/aP2, fatty-acid synthase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, C/EBPα, and adiponutrin. Interestingly, a detectable level of desnutrin mRNA could be observed in 3T3-L1 cells as early as 24 h after induction of differentiation, preceding the expression of the various late adipocyte markers. Thus, desnutrin is an adipocyte gene induced early during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Induction of Desnutrin mRNA by Fasting and by Glucocorticoids—Expression of the adiponutrin gene, which is closely related to desnutrin, is dramatically down-regulated by fasting, and its levels are restored upon refeeding (18Baulande S. Lasnier F. Lucas M. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33336-33344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Because of the homology between the two putative proteins, we decided to investigate whether desnutrin gene expression could also be regulated by the nutritional status of the organism. WAT from animals subjected to fasting/refeeding was analyzed for desnutrin expression. As shown in Fig. 4A, the levels of desnutrin mRNA were higher in 24-h fasted mice than in mice that underwent food deprivation for the same time period and then were refed for 12 h. These results show evidence of nutritional regulation of desnutrin gene expression. To determine whether desnutrin expression is down-regulated during refeeding or up-regulated by food deprivation, a set of time course experiments were conducted in which mice were fasted for 12, 24, and 48 h or fed for 12 additional h after 48 h of fasting. As shown in Fig. 4B, compared with fed mice, desnutrin mRNA levels increased rapidly after 12 h of fasting, reaching a maximal level and then gradually decreasing to basal levels 48 h after fasting was initiated. Interestingly the expression pattern of the desnutrin gene was inversely correlated with that of the adiponutrin gene, whose expression practically disappeared when mice were fasted, but was induced upon refeeding. The fatty-acid synthase gene, known to be tightly regulated by fasting and refeeding (19Sul H.S. Wang D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 331-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), was used as a control. As predicted, fatty-acid synthase mRNA levels were not detectable during fasting, but increased drastically during the refeeding period. Together, these results indicate that desnutrin gene expression is rapidly and transiently induced in WAT by fasting. During fasting, circulating glucagon and glucocorticoids levels are elevated, and these hormones serve as mediators of the adaptive response to starvation by inducing changes in gene expression to face the new metabolic conditions. Because desnutrin mRNA is induced during fasting, we investigated whether cAMP, the mediator of glucagon action, or glucocorticoids can regulate desnutrin expression. Confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, which do not have detectable levels of desnutrin mRNA, were treated for 48 h with dexamethasone, MIX, dibutyryl cAMP, or dexamethasone/MIX. As shown in Fig. 5A, neither MIX (an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase) nor the cAMP analog dibutyryl cAMP induced expression of the desnutrin gene, indicating that cAMP and glucagon are not involved in the induction of desnutrin mRNA during fasting. However, dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, was ab"

The radial glial cell, a transient embryonic cell type known for its crucial role in neuronal migration, has recently been shown to function as a neuronal progenitor cell and appears to produce most cortical pyramidal neurons. Radial glial cell modulation could thus affect neuron production, neuronal migration, and overall cortical architecture; however, signaling mechanisms among radial glia have not been studied directly. We demonstrate here that calcium waves propagate through radial glial cells in the proliferative cortical ventricular zone (VZ). Radial glial calcium waves occur spontaneously and require connexin hemichannels, P2Y1 ATP receptors, and intracellular IP3-mediated calcium release. Furthermore, we show that wave disruption decreases VZ proliferation during the peak of embryonic neurogenesis. Taken together, these results demonstrate a radial glial signaling mechanism that may regulate cortical neuronal production."

By blocking or slowing this bursting activity, via in ovo drug applications at precise developmental periods, we show that such activity is also required at much earlier stages for spinal motoneurons to accurately execute their first major dorsal-ventral pathfinding decision. Blockade or slowing of rhythmic bursting activity also prevents the normal expression patterns of EphA4 and polysialic acid on NCAM, which may contribute to the pathfinding errors observed. More prolonged (E2–5) blockade resulted in a downregulation of LIM homeodomain transcription factors, but since this occurred only after the pathfinding errors and alterations in guidance molecules, it cannot have contributed to them."
https://openalex.org/W2083440806,"During protein biosynthesis, nascent polypeptide chains that emerge from the ribosomal exit tunnel encounter ribosome-associated chaperones, which assist their folding to the native state1,2. Here we present a 2.7 Å crystal structure of Escherichia coli trigger factor, the best-characterized chaperone of this type, together with the structure of its ribosome-binding domain in complex with the Haloarcula marismortui large ribosomal subunit. Trigger factor adopts a unique conformation resembling a crouching dragon with separated domains forming the amino-terminal ribosome-binding ‘tail’, the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase ‘head’, the carboxy-terminal ‘arms’ and connecting regions building up the ‘back’. From its attachment point on the ribosome, trigger factor projects the extended domains over the exit of the ribosomal tunnel, creating a protected folding space where nascent polypeptides may be shielded from proteases and aggregation. This study sheds new light on our understanding of co-translational protein folding, and suggests an unexpected mechanism of action for ribosome-associated chaperones."

Using multimodal neuroimaging, we identified a neural mechanism underlying the WS visuoconstructive deficit. Hierarchical assessment of visual processing with fMRI showed isolated hypoactivation in WS in the parietal portion of the dorsal stream. In the immediately adjacent parietooccipital/intraparietal sulcus, structural neuroimaging showed a gray matter volume reduction in participants with WS. Path analysis demonstrated that the functional abnormalities could be attributed to impaired input from this structurally altered region. Our observations confirm a longstanding hypothesis about dorsal stream dysfunction in WS, demonstrate effects of a localized abnormality on visual information processing in humans, and define a systems-level phenotype for mapping genetic determinants of visuoconstructive function."
https://openalex.org/W2105430025,"The existence of two classes of cells, simple and complex, discovered by Hubel and Wiesel in 1962, is one of the fundamental features of cat primary visual cortex. A quantitative measure used to distinguish simple and complex cells is the ratio between modulated and unmodulated components of spike responses to drifting gratings, an index that forms a bimodal distribution. We have found that the modulation ratio, when derived from the subthreshold membrane potential instead of from spike rate, is unimodally distributed, but highly skewed. The distribution of the modulation ratio as derived from spike rate can, in turn, be predicted quantitatively by the nonlinear properties of spike threshold applied to the skewed distribution of the subthreshold modulation ratio. Threshold also increases the spatial segregation of ON and OFF regions of the receptive field, a defining attribute of simple cells. The distinction between simple and complex cells is therefore enhanced by threshold, much like the selectivity for stimulus features such as orientation and direction. In this case, however, a continuous distribution in the spatial organization of synaptic inputs is transformed into two distinct classes of cells."

https://openalex.org/W2148992247,"The crystal structure of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα, NR3B1) complexed with a coactivator peptide from peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) reveals a transcriptionally active conformation in the absence of a ligand. This is the first x-ray structure of ERRα LBD, solved to a resolution of 2.5 Å, and the first structure of a PGC-1α complex. The putative ligand binding pocket (LBP) of ERRα is almost completely occupied by side chains, in particular with the bulky side chain of Phe328 (corresponding to Ala272 in ERRγ and Ala350 in estrogen receptor α). Therefore, a ligand of a size equivalent to more than ∼4 carbon atoms could only bind in the LBP, if ERRα would undergo a major conformational change (in particular the ligand would displace H12 from its agonist position). The x-ray structure thus provides strong evidence for ligand-independent transcriptional activation by ERRα. The interactions of PGC-1α with ERRα also reveal for the first time the atomic details of how a coactivator peptide containing an inverted LXXLL motif (namely a LLXYL motif) binds to a LBD. In addition, we show that a PGC-1α peptide containing this nuclear box motif from the L3 site binds ERRα LBD with a higher affinity than a peptide containing a steroid receptor coactivator-1 motif and that the affinity is further enhanced when all three leucine-rich regions of PGC-1α are present.

Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6081) Google Scholar). Although the transcriptional activity of NRs is often regulated by specific ligands, several members of the superfamily have no known natural ligands and are therefore referred to as orphan NRs (2Giguere V. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 689-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα; NR3B1) was the first orphan NR to be identified on the basis of its similarity with estrogen receptor α (ERα; NR3A1) (3Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). ERRα and its relatives ERRβ (NR3B2) and ERRγ (NR3B3) form a small family of orphan NRs that are evolutionarily related to the estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ. ERRs preferentially bind to DNA sites composed of a single half-site preceded by three nucleotides with the consensus sequence TNAAGGTCA, referred to as an ERR response element. It has been shown that ERRα also efficiently binds to estrogen response elements and that these receptors share common target genes (4Vanacker J.M. Pettersson K. Gustafsson J.-A. Laudet V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4270-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). This observation was further supported by studies demonstrating cross-talk between the ER and ERR pathways (reviewed in Ref. 5Giguere V. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 220-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The most striking feature observed in the phenotype of mice lacking ERRα is their resistance to high fat diet-induced obesity and the impaired activity of enzymes implicated in lipid metabolism. This finding led to the hypothesis that ERRα could be implicated in obesity or metabolic diseases (6Luo J. Sladek R. Carrier J. Bader J.-A. Richard D. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7947-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). A function of ERRα on bone metabolism has also been suggested (7Bonnelye E. Vanacker J.-M. Dittmar T. Begue A. Desbiens X. Denhardt D.T. Aubin J.E. Laudet V. Fournier B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8Bonnelye E. Merdad L. Kung V. Aubin J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Finally, recent publications show that ERRα and ERRγ are associated with biomarkers of breast cancer and further emphasize the importance of ER-ERR cross-talk (9Ariazi E.A. Clark G.M. Mertz J.E. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6510-6518PubMed Google Scholar). Despite their overall sequence similarity with the ERs, ERRs seem to regulate transcription in the absence of known natural agonist ligands. The presence of a phenylalanine residue (Phe328 on H3) in the ligand binding pocket (LBP) has been found to be essential for the constitutive activity of ERRα, because its mutation to alanine abolishes constitutive activity (10Chen S. Zhou D. Yang C. Sherman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28465-28470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, alanine residues are found at the corresponding positions of ERRβ and ERRγ, indicating either different structural reasons for the apparent constitutive activity or a different mode of regulation for these other ERR isotypes. Searches for ERR ligands have so far mostly identified antagonists. Two organochlorine pesticides, toxaphene and chlordane, were reported to be antagonists for ERRα (11Yang C. Chen S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4519-4524PubMed Google Scholar). Also 4-hydroxytamoxifen, which binds to ERRβ and ERRγ but not to ERRα, and diethylstilbestrol (DES), which is reported to bind to all three ERRs, were shown to inhibit the ability of ERRs to activate transcription (12Tremblay G.B. Kunath T. Bergeron D. Lapointe L. Champigny C. Bader J.A. Rossant J. Giguere V. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 13Lu D. Kiriyami Y. Lee K.Y. Giguere V. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6755-6761PubMed Google Scholar). Coward et al. (14Coward P. Lee D. Hull M.V. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8880-8884Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) reported that DES, at a concentration of 10 μm, disrupted the steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) binding to ERRα but did not observe any inhibition of ERRα transcriptional activity even at high DES concentrations. The binding of DES to ERRα has also been challenged by the model proposed by Chen et al. (10Chen S. Zhou D. Yang C. Sherman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28465-28470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Suetsugi et al. (15Suetsugi M. Su L. Karlsberg K. Yuan Y.C. Chen S. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 13: 981-991Google Scholar) have reported that flavone and isoflavone phytoestrogens display agonistic activity in an ERRα transactivation assay. The recent elucidation of the crystal structures of ERRγ ligand binding domain (LBD) bound to an SRC-1 peptide (16Greschik H. Wurtz J.M. Sanglier S. Bourguet W. van Dorsselaer A. Moras D. Renaud J.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), as well as of ERRγ LBD bound to the antagonists DES and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (17Greschik H. Flaig R. Renaud J.P. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33639-33646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggests that the ERRs assume the conformation of ligand-activated nuclear receptors (NRs) in the absence of ligand and that agonist ligands may not be required (but rather that ERRs might be ligand-inactivated instead). The cavity volume of the ligand binding pocket (LBP) for unliganded ERRγ was reported as 220 Å3 (16Greschik H. Wurtz J.M. Sanglier S. Bourguet W. van Dorsselaer A. Moras D. Renaud J.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), which was the smallest observed value for an NR LBP at that time. These findings in general raised the question of how the activity of ERRs is regulated in vivo. Recently, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) was reported to be not only an efficient coactivator of ERRα, but also to induce expression of ERRα (18Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Brogli K. Uhlmann T. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9013-9018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 19Laganiere J. Tremblay G.B. Dufour C.R. Giroux S. Rousseau F. Giguere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18504-18510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the absence of PGC-1α, ERRα is a very weak activator of transcription (18Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Brogli K. Uhlmann T. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9013-9018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Coexpression of PGC-1α enables potent transcriptional activation by ERRα. These findings suggested that ERRα is not a constitutively active receptor and that transformation into an active form is favored by binding to protein ligands, such as PGC-1α, rather than to small lipophilic ligands. The mapping of the PGC-1α coactivator for ERRα binding regions revealed three leucine-rich nuclear box motifs. Mutagenesis studies indicated a major role for the L3 site (18Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Brogli K. Uhlmann T. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9013-9018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 20Huss J.M. Kopp R.P. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40265-40274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), which contains an inverted LXXLL motif (namely a LLXYL motif) and is the most important site of interaction between ERRα and PGC-1α. Even though PGC-1α appears to be a coactivator for a broad range of nuclear receptors (e.g. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, ERα, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4, thyroid receptor α, and retinoic acid receptor α), it seems to have a distinct binding interface with ERRα, compared with other nuclear receptors. Indeed, although the L3 site seems to be the hallmark of the PGC-1α binding to ERRα, the binding of PGC-1α to hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 and ERα occurs via the L2 motif (20Huss J.M. Kopp R.P. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40265-40274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). PGC-1α function has been implicated in the control of energy metabolism, because PGC-1α expression stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and modulates mitochondrial function and utilization of energy (reviewed in Ref. 21Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). It was then reported that ERRα and PGC-1α cooperate to induce mitochondrial biogenesis and to regulate the oxydative phosphorylation pathway (22Schreiber S.N. Emter R. Hock M.B. Knutti D. Cardenas J. Podvinec M. Oakeley E.J. Kralli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6472-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 23Mootha V.K. Handschin C. Arlow D. Xie X. St. Pierre J. Sihag S.

A. 2004; 101: 6570-6575Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In the latter study also a novel synthetic inhibitor of ERRα was reported, and it was suggested that ERRα agonists may ameliorate insulin resistance in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (23Mootha V.K. Handschin C. Arlow D. Xie X. St. Pierre J. Sihag S. Yang W. Altshuler D. Puigserver P. Patterson N. Willy P.J. Schulman I.G. Heyman R.A. Lander E.S. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6570-6575Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Here we report the first crystal structure of the human ERRα LBD, bound to a PGC-1α coactivator peptide (containing the L3 site) at 2.5-Å resolution. In the crystal, the ERRα LBD adopts a transcriptionally active conformation in the absence of any ligand. The LBP of ERRα is almost completely filled with side chains, and in particular Phe328 occupies the central part of the hypothetical LBP. Docking of DES into the LBP shows that binding would only be possibly upon a major conformational rearrangement of ERRα, involving in particular also H12 (implying that if DES binds, it would act as an antagonist of ERRα). Because the unoccupied volume in the LBP is only 100 Å3, a hypothetical agonist of ERRα (binding to the LBP) would likely have to be composed of at most four to five non-hydrogen atoms. The interactions of PGC-1α with ERRα also reveal for the first time the atomic details of how a coactivator peptide containing an inverted LXXLL motif (namely a LLXYL motif) binds to a NR LBD. Protein Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The ERRα LBD (amino acids 290–519, numbering according to Swiss-Prot P11479) was amplified by PCR under the conditions given by the manufacturer of the enzyme. At the 5′-end of each oligonucleotide, the nucleotides necessary for the integration of the final PCR fragment into the template baculovirus transfer vector were added by following the rules we described (24Geiser M. Cebe R. Drewello D. Schmitz R. BioTechniques. 2001; 31: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and the PCR fragment was finally integrated into the BacPAK8™ transfer vector (Clontech) resulting in plasmid pXI392. The correctness of the construction was verified by DNA sequence analysis. Insect cells were transfected by using the BacPAK8™ Baculovirus expression system kit. The resulting recombinant Baculovirus with the ERRα LBD gene was plaque-cloned and amplified to a titer of 1.2–1.4 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml as described elsewhere (25Strauss A. Bitsch F. Cutting B. Fendrich G. Graff P. Liebetanz J. Zurini M. Jahnke W. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 26: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Precultures for production of Sf9 cells adapted to serum-free medium SF900 II (Invitrogen) were cultivated as 100-ml shake flask cultures for 3 days, at 27 °C, shaken at 90 rpm. Production cultures with 1-liter final volume in 5-liter Erlenmeyer flasks (100 ml of preculture plus 900 ml of SF900 II medium) were cultivated for 3 days, at 28 °C and 90 rpm, to a cell density of 3–4 × 106 cells/ml. After diluting the culture with SF900 II medium to a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml, cells were infected with recombinant Baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1, and the 1-liter cultures were cultivated post-infection for 3 days, at 28 °C and 90 rpm. ERRα LBD-expressing cells were harvested by centrifugation in 500-ml portions in 1-liter centrifuge bottles at 400 × g at 20 °C for 20 min, pelleted cells were re-suspended in 30 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.2, with a protease inhibitor mix (Complete®, Roche Applied Science) in 50-ml plastic tubes, centrifuged again under the same conditions, frozen and stored at –80 °C. ERRα LBD expression in cultures was monitored by SDS-PAGE analysis as described elsewhere (25Strauss A. Bitsch F. Cutting B. Fendrich G. Graff P. Liebetanz J. Zurini M. Jahnke W. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 26: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), with Coomassie-staining and Western blotting using anti-penta-His antibodies (Qiagen). For purification, frozen Sf9 cell pellets were homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the protease inhibitor mixture Complete® without EDTA (Roche Applied Science), then sonicated and centrifuged before affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen). The protein was eluted with a step gradient of 500 mm imidazole and was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography (ResQ-6 ml) and size exclusion chromatography (Superdex SPX75/16/60, Amersham Biosciences). The ERRα LBD in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol was concentrated to 15.4 mg/ml prior crystallization. The resulting protein was estimated to be >95% pure and homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Mass spectrometry was performed on a Q-Tof (Micromass, Manchester, UK) quadrupole time-of-flight hybrid tandem mass spectrometer equipped with a Micromass Z-type electrospray ionization source. The measured molecular mass of 27,042.2 Da of the protein corresponded to acetyl-GSSHHHHHHLEVLFQGP-ERRα-LBD-(290–519). The purified protein is a homodimer as evidenced by size-exclusion chromatography coupled to light scattering measurement using the minDawn Tristar (Wyatt Technology Corp.) and by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry operated under native conditions. In some initial experiments, the N-terminal polyhistidine tag of ERRα LBD was cleaved after the affinity chromatography step, by the PreScission™ protease (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions (2 units/100 μg of protein). SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analysis of the cleaved protein showed a homogeneous protein that however failed to crystallize. The PGC-1α plasmid was a kind gift from A. Kralli (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) and has been described in a previous study (18Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Brogli K. Uhlmann T. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9013-9018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The domain of the PGC-1α protein containing all three nuclear boxes (amino acids 126–288) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli by standard procedures. The hexa-His-tagged thioredoxin-A fusion protein was purified from frozen cell pellets by affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography as described above. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—For crystallization, a 3:1 stoichiometric excess of PGC-1α peptide containing the L3 site (Neosystem; sequence: RPASELLKYLTT, i.e. amino acids 205–216 of PGC-1α with the mutation C207A) was added to the protein solution. Crystals were obtained at 4 °C by the vapor diffusion method in 1-μl hanging drops containing equal volumes of protein (15.4 mg/ml ERRα LBD, 1.7 mm PGC-1 peptide, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and crystallization buffer (0.45 m NaCl, 0.33 m potassium iodide, 15% w/v polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.075 m sodium MES, pH 6.5). Crystals with hexagonal dipyramidal morphology and maximal dimensions of ∼0.1 mm appeared after 2–3 weeks. Diffraction data at 100 K were collected at the Swiss Light Source (beamline X06SA), using a Marresearch charge-coupled device detector and an incident monochromatic x-ray beam with 0.8000-Å wavelength. Raw diffraction data were processed and scaled with the HKL program suite version 1.96.1 (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38556) Google Scholar).

Bioconjugate Techniques. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 320-322Google Scholar): PGC-1α-(205–216): RPCSELLKYLTT; SRC-1-(682–697): SLTARHKILHRLLQEG. Peptide ligand binding to ERRα LBD was measured with the confocal research reader RR04 from Evotec Technologies as described before (35Schilb A. Riou V. Schoepfer J. Ottl J. Mueller K. Chene P. Mayr L. Filipuzzi I. J. Biomol. Screening. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The final binding buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 3 mm dithiothreitol. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—DSC analysis was performed on buffer solutions (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing the ERRα LBD:PGC-1α-(205–216) peptide complex (1:20 molar ratio), the ERRα LBD:PGC-1α-(126–288) protein complex (1:1 molar ratio), and the ERRα LBD complexes with several flavones (1:20 molar ratios; purchased from Indofine Chemicals Co.), respectively. The ERRα LBD concentration was 40 μm and typically 400 μl of protein complex solution were consumed per analysis. DSC scans were obtained using a MicroCal VP-capDSC system (MicroCal, LLC, Northampton, MA) at a scan rate of 250 °C/h. Structure Determination of the Complex between ERRα LBD and a PGC-1α Peptide—We have expressed human ERRα LBD (PreScission™ cleavable N-terminal His tag followed by residues Val290-Asp519 of ERRα) in the Baculovirus system. Whereas our attempts to express ERRα LBD in E. coli were unsuccessful (giving not properly folded protein), the level and quality of the ERRα LBD expressed in Baculovirus-infected insect cells was sufficiently high for structural studies. Protein expression analysis of the production cultures by SDS-PAGE showed a dominant band on Coomassie-stained gels at a molecular mass of ∼28 kDa, corresponding to a strong, single band on Western blots treated with anti-penta-His antibody. All the expressed ERRα LBD protein was soluble, and no sign of degradation products could be detected. Expression levels were ∼30 mg/liter. The protein was prepared in a three-step purification and without cleaving off the N-terminal tag. Extensive crystallization trials with an SRC-1 peptide or without adding a coactivator peptide did not yield usable crystals. Based on the increasing evidence that the transcriptional activity of ERRα is strongly dependent on the coactivator PGC-1α (in particular its L3 site, which contains an inverted LXXLL motif), we decided to attempt ERRα crystallization together with such a PGC-1α peptide. We added a 3:1 stoichiometric excess of PGC-1α peptide containing the L3 site (sequence RPASELLKYLTT, i.e. with mutation C207A) and crystallized the complex. Crystals belonging to the hexagonal space group P6522 (unit cell: a = b = 110.0 Å, c = 104.7 Å, 1 complex/asymmetric unit) reached maximal dimensions of up to 0.1 mm in hanging drops at 4 °C within 3 weeks. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of ERRγ LBD (16Greschik H. Wurtz J.M. Sanglier S. Bourguet W. van Dorsselaer A. Moras D. Renaud J.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and refined to 2.5-Å resolution. The Overall Structure of the Complex between ERRα LBD and PGC-1α Peptide Reveals a Transcriptionally Active Conformation in the Absence of a Ligand in the LBP—The results of the crystallographic refinement are summarized in Table I. In general the electron density for the ERRα LBD is well defined, except for the His tag, residues Pro309-Pro319 (loop L2-L3), residues Arg462-Glu470 (loop L9-L10), and the C-terminal residues Met517-Asp519 (all of which were not modeled). The protein part of the refined model consists of the PreScission™ site (LEVLFQG) followed by amino acids Val290-Met308, Ala320-Gly461, and Arg471-Ala516 of the ERRα LBD. The refined model also contains 83 water molecules, 1 iodine, and residues Ser208-Thr216 of the PGC-1α peptide. The asymmetric unit contains one ERRα LBD monomer complexed to a peptide containing the L3 site of PGC-1α (Fig. 1A). Two ERRα LBD monomers form via a crystallographic 2-fold axis a dimer. The ERRα LBD adopts the canonical three-layered α-helical sandwich structure (Fig. 1A). The nomenclature of the secondary structure elements is based on the retinoid X receptor LBD crystal structure (36Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar) and is identical to the one used for ERRγ LBD (16Greschik H. Wurtz J.M. Sanglier S. Bourguet W. van Dorsselaer A. Moras D. Renaud J.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). ERRα LBD bound to the PGC-1α peptide is in an agonist state (without a ligand bound in the putative LBP), as judged by the position of H12 (37Renaud J.P. Moras D. Cell. Mol. Life"
https://openalex.org/W1978626949,"Dscam is an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily member that regulates axon guidance and targeting in Drosophila. Alternative splicing potentially generates 38,016 isoforms differing in their extracellular Ig and transmembrane domains. We demonstrate that Dscam mediates the sorting of axons in the developing mushroom body (MB). This correlates with the precise spatiotemporal pattern of Dscam protein expression. We demonstrate that MB neurons express different arrays of Dscam isoforms and that single MB neurons express multiple isoforms. Two different Dscam isoforms differing in their extracellular domains introduced as transgenes into single mutant cells partially rescued the mutant phenotype. Expression of one isoform of Dscam in a cohort of MB neurons induced dominant phenotypes, while expression of a single isoform in a single cell did not. We propose that different extracellular domains of Dscam share a common function and that differences in isoforms expressed on the surface of neighboring axons influence interactions between them."

However, the mechanism that causes the increase in VEGF expression still remains to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that activation of PI3K signaling mediated VEGF protein expression at the transcriptional level through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) expression in human ovarian cancer cells. We found that inhibition of PI3K activity by LY294002 decreased VEGF transcriptional activation and that forced expression of AKT completely reversed the inhibitory effect. HDM2 and p70S6K1 are two downstream targets of AKT that mediate growth factor-induced VEGF transcriptional activation and HIF-1α expression.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were maintained in EGM endothelial cell medium (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ). All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator, and trypsin (0.25%) was used to detach adherent cells for subculture. LY294002 and wortmannin were obtained from Calbiochem, and rapamycin was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Immunoblotting Analysis—Cells were washed in cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm NaF) supplemented with 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm leupeptin, 2 mm aprotinin, and 2 mm pepstatin on ice for 30 min. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Total cellular protein concentration was assayed using Bio-Rad® protein assay reagent. Aliquots (40 μg) of protein were loaded onto a SDS/polyacrylamide gel and resolved by gel electrophoresis. Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with 150 mm glycine and 20% (v/v) methanol. Membranes were blocked with either 5% nonfat dry milk in 1× Tris-buffered saline or 5% bovine serum albumin in 1× Tris-buffered saline and incubated with protein specific antibodies. Proteins were detected via horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and visualized through enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). cDNA Constructs—HIF-1α wild type and HIF-1α dominant negative were cloned into the pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen) as we described previously (1Paley P.J. Staskus K.A. Gebhard K. Mohanraj D. Twiggs L.B. Carson L.F. Ramakrishnan S. Cancer. 1997; 80: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The human VEGF reporter was constructed by inserting a 2.65-kb KpnI-BssHII fragment of human VEGF gene promoter into the pGL2-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) (pVEGF-Luc). The pMAP11wt VEGF reporter was constructed by PCR amplification of a fragment of the VEGF promoter from –985 to –939. This fragment regulates VEGF transcription in response to hypoxia and contains the HIF-1 binding site. The pMAP11mut was constructed by substituting 3 bp in the HIF-1 binding sequence of the pMAP11wt VEGF reporter. This 3-bp substitution abolishes HIF-1 binding to the region. The β-galactosidase gene driven by the CMV promoter was used as a control plasmid for transfection efficiency. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—OVCAR-3 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at a density of 0.3 × 106 cells/well the day before the transfection. The cells were washed twice with warm Hank's buffered salt solution (Invitrogen) and then transfected with LipofectAMINE (Sigma) per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the DNA was incubated with 5 μl/well LipofectAMINE in serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) for 30 min. This solution was then added to the cells and allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 4.5 h. The LipofectAMINE was then removed, and cells were cultured as described above. For the luciferase assays, cells were transfected with VEGF promoter reporter and pCMV-β-galactosidase (control). The cells were cultured for 12 h after transfection followed by incubation in the absence or presence of LY294002 or rapamycin. At the end of incubation, the cells were collected in luciferase lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 250 μl of luciferase lysis buffer was added to each well and placed at –70 °C until frozen. Cells and lysis buffer were allowed to thaw and then collected and stored at –70 °C until use. Aliquots of protein samples were used for luciferase assay using luciferase substrate (Promega, Madison, WI) and measured by a monolight luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was determined using 40 μg of cellular protein extracts by the hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl-b-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 1 h. Stable Transfection—A2780/CP70 cells were transfected using pcDNA3 vector alone or pcDNA3-HDM2, which contains a neomycin resistance cassette. The cells were cultured overnight after transfection followed by the addition of G418. The G418 resistant cells were pooled after 2 weeks and cultured as described above in media supplemented with G418. VEGF ELISA—Media were collected from cells and centrifuged at 800 rpm for 4 min at room temperature to remove any cellular debris and then stored at –70 °C. Wells of a 96-well plate were coated with VEGF polyclonal capture antibodies (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) overnight at 4 °C. Aliquots of media were then added to each well and allowed to incubate at room temperature. VEGF monoclonal detection antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (R&D Systems) was added to the wells and incubated. The wells were washed, the levels of VEGF were detected using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzathione-6-sulfonic acid as substrate, and 1% H2O2 was then added. The color change was then measured in a 96-well micro plate reader and compared with the VEGF standard in the same assay. The PI3K Inhibitor LY294002 Inhibited VEGF Transcriptional Activation and Protein Expression in Ovarian Cancer Cells—Increased VEGF expression is an important factor for inducing ovarian tumorigenesis; however, the mechanism of its elevation still remains to be elucidated. To determine whether PI3K activity plays a role in VEGF transcriptional activation, OVCAR-3 cells were transfected with a VEGF promoter reporter containing a 2.6-kb human VEGF promoter. Inhibition of PI3K activity by LY294002 inhibited the VEGF reporter activity (Fig. 1, A and B). This result indicates that PI3K activity is required for VEGF transcriptional activation. It is known that VEGF transcription is mainly regulated by HIF-1 in response to hypoxia. To test whether the HIF-1 binding site at the VEGF promoter is important for PI3K-mediated VEGF transcriptional activation, we constructed a VEGF reporter containing a functional promoter fragment with the HIF-1 binding site. Inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 also inhibited the VEGF reporter in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, C and D). Mutation of the HIF-1 binding site abolished the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on VEGF transcriptional activity (Fig. 1E). Thus, the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on VEGF transcriptional activation requires the HIF-1 binding site at the VEGF promoter. To determine whether LY294002 treatment affects VEGF protein levels, OVCAR-3 and A2780/CP70 cells were treated with LY294002. A2780/CP70 cells contain the lost function of p53 protein, which would test the effect of PI3K inhibition without p53 activity in the cells. The VEGF protein levels in the medium were measured by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1, F and G, LY294002 treatment significantly decreased VEGF protein levels in both cell lines.Fig. 1The effects of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (LY) on VEGF transcriptional activation and VEGF protein level.A and B, OVCAR-3 cells were seeded at 0.5 × 106 cells/well on a 6-well plate the day before the transfection. To test VEGF transcriptional activation, the cells were co-transfected with pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid and a VEGF reporter containing a 2.6-kb human VEGF promoter fragment in the pGL2 vector, pVEGF-Luc. After the transfection, the cells were cultured for 12 h followed by incubation in the absence or presence of LY294002 at the indicated concentrations for 24 (A) and 36 h (B). The relative luciferase activity was determined by the ratio of luciferase:β-galactosidase activity and normalized to the control in the cells. C and D, cells were co-transfected with pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid and a VEGF reporter containing a 46-bp functional human VEGF promoter with the HIF-1 binding site, pMAP11wt. The cells were cultured and treated with LY294002 for 24 h (C) and 36 h (D) as described above. E, the cells were co-transfected with pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid and the pMAP11mut, which contained 3-bp substitutions at the HIF-1 binding site of pMAP11wt. The cells were treated with LY294002 as described above for 36 h. F and G, OVCAR-3 (F) and A2780/CP70 (G) cells were treated with Me2SO or LY294002 for 24 and 36 h. VEGF protein levels were analyzed by ELISA using 100 μl of media as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the values were normalized to the control. * indicates a significant difference from the control (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) LY294002-inhibited VEGF transcriptional Activation Was Reversed by HIF-1α—To further study whether the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on VEGF transcriptional activation depends on HIF-1α expression, the cells were co-transfected with VEGF promoter reporters and HIF-1α plasmids. Transfection with HIF-1α alone significantly increased the VEGF reporter activity, completely reversed LY294002-inhibited VEGF transcriptional activation, and resulted in even higher levels of activity (Fig. 2A). This result shows that HIF-1α is sufficient to induce VEGF transcriptional activation in the cells. To test whether HIF-1 activity is required for the VEGF expression, the cells were transfected with HIF-1α dominant negative construct, which inhibited the VEGF promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). The inhibition was not affected significantly by combined treatment with LY294002 and the HIF-1 dominant negative construct (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that LY294002-inhibited VEGF transcriptional activation depends on HIF-1α expression. HIF-1α Protein Expression in Ovarian Cancer Cells Required PI3K Activity—To determine whether HIF-1α expression is mediated by PI3K in ovarian cancer cells, HIF-1α protein levels were measured in several ovarian cancer cells in the absence or presence of LY294002. HIF-1α protein levels in human endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) were used as a negative control. HIF-1α expression levels in all ovarian cancer cell lines were much higher than those in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Fig. 3A). LY294002 treatment specifically inhibited HIF-1α, but not HIF-1β expression, indicating that HIF-1α expression in these cells required PI3K activation. To determine whether PI3K is required for growth factor-induced HIF-1α expression, the cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h followed by the addition of 10% serum, insulin, or IGF-1. Treatment with serum, insulin, or IGF-1 greatly increased HIF-1α expression in OVCAR-3, A2780/CP70, and A2780 cell lines, and the induced HIF-1α expression was inhibited by LY294002 (Fig. 3, B and C). Due to the high basal level in SKOV-3 cells, HIF-1α expression was not induced by IGF-1 but induced by insulin (Fig. 3C). Both the basal level and induced HIF-1α expression were inhibited by LY294002 treatment. These data further confirm that PI3K mediates VEGF transcriptional activation through HIF-1α but not HIF-1β levels in the ovarian cancer cells with different properties. AKT Is Essential for PI3K-mediated VEGF Transcriptional Activation—AKT is a known target of PI3K. To confirm that AKT was activated by serum and inhibited by LY294002 in the ovarian cancer cells, the cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h, pretreated with LY294002 for 30 min, and then stimulated by serum for 1.5 h. AKT activation, indicated by its protein phosphorylation, was increased by serum stimulation and inhibited by LY294002 (Fig. 4A). To determine whether expression of active form of AKT is sufficient to restore LY294002-inhibited VEGF transcriptional activation, OVCAR-3 cells were transfected with VEGF reporter and myristylated AKT. Transfection of AKT significantly increased VEGF reporter activity and completely reversed LY294002-inhibited VEGF reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4, B and C). Because the full activation of AKT still requires PI3K activity, the reporter activity is much lower in the presence of LY294002 than that in the absence of LY294002 (Fig. 4). These data indicate that AKT is a sufficient target of PI3K for mediating VEGF expression. Rapamycin Decreased VEGF Transcriptional Activation and VEGF Protein Production—Rapamycin is a specific inhibitor for mammalian target of rapamycin and p70S6K1. To investigate whether rapamycin inhibited VEGF transcriptional activation, OVCAR-3 cells were transfected with the VEGF reporter followed by the treatment with solvent alone or rapamycin. VEGF reporter activity was decreased by rapamycin treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that activation of mammalian target of rapamycin and p70S6K1 is involved in VEGF transcriptional activation. To determine whether rapamycin treatment also inhibited VEGF protein levels in ovarian cancer cells, the cells were treated with rapamycin, and VEGF levels were analyzed by ELISA. Rapamycin treatment decreased VEGF protein levels in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5, C and D). P70S6K1 Was Sufficient to Reverse LY294002-inhibited VEGF Transcriptional Activation—To test whether expression of an active form of p70S6K1 is sufficient to reverse LY294002-inhibited VEGF transcriptional activation, OVCAR-3 cells were transfected with a VEGF reporter and a constitutively active form of p70S6K1. As shown in Fig. 6, forced expression of p70S6K1 greatly increased VEGF reporter activity and reversed LY294002-inhibited VEGF transcriptional activation in a dose-dependent manner. These data indicate that p70S6K1 is an important downstream target of PI3K and AKT for inducing VEGF transcriptional activation in ovarian cancer cells. Rapamycin Inhibited HIF-1α, but Not HIF-1β, Expression in OVCAR-3 and A2780/CP70 Cells—To determine whether rapamycin inhibits HIF-1α and HIF-1β expression in response to growth factor stimulation, OVCAR-3 and A2780/CP70 cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h followed by the addition of serum, IGF-1, or insulin. Rapamycin specifically inhibited HIF-1α but not HIF-1β expression in response to serum, IGF-1, and insulin (Fig. 7). This result indicates that rapamycin may inhibit VEGF transcriptional activation through a decrease of HIF-1α expression in the cells. Inhibition of PI3K Decreased HDM2 Phosphorylation and Expression in Ovarian Cancer Cells—Previous studies have indicated that AKT may up-regulate the function of HDM2 via phosphorylation (41Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 42Ogawara Y. Kishishita S. Obata T. Isazawa Y. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21843-21850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibition of PI3K/AKT by LY294002 affects HDM2 phosphorylation and protein levels, OVCAR-3 cells were treated with LY294002 and analyzed by immunoblotting for HDM2 expression. Both HDM2 phosphorylation and protein expression were inhibited by LY294002 (Fig. 8). Forced Expression of HDM2 Reversed LY294002-inhibited VEGF Transcriptional Activation, VEGF Expression, and HIF-1α Expression—To determine whether HDM2 acts downstream of PI3K to affect VEGF transcriptional activation, OVCAR-3 cells were transfected with VEGF reporter and HDM2 plasmids. After the transfection, the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of LY294002. Forced expression of HDM2 reversed LY294002-inhibited VEGF reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner (9A), indicating that HDM2 was sufficient to restore LY294002-inhibited VEGF transcriptional activation. To test whether the HIF-1 binding site is required for HDM2-mediated VEGF reporter activity, we used the mutant VEGF reporter at the HIF-1 DNA binding site. Neither LY294002 nor HDM2 affected the mutant VEGF reporter activity (Fig. 9B), indicating that LY294002 and HDM2 regulate the reporter activity through the HIF-1 binding site. HDM2 Restored LY294002-inhibited VEGF Protein Production—To study whether HDM2 reversed LY294002-inhibited VEGF protein expression, the cells were transiently transfected with vector alone or HDM2 followed by treatment with LY294002. HDM2 partially reversed the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on VEGF protein levels (Fig. 10). These data indicate that HDM2 plays an important role in PI3K-mediated VEGF transcriptional activation and VEGF protein expression. To determine whether HDM2 restores LY294002-inhibited HIF-1α expression, A2780/CP70 cells stably expressing HDM2 or vector alone were cultured in serum-free medium and then treated with 10% serum in the presence or absence of LY294002. Expression of HDM2 in the cells reversed LY294002-inhibited HIF-1α expression (Fig. 11). Taken together, these results suggest that PI3K and AKT mediate VEGF transcriptional activation through HIF-1α expression and that HDM2 and p70S6K1 signaling pathways are two parallel pathways that mediate this process. It is known that VEGF plays an important role in ovarian tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. However, the mechanism by which VEGF expression is elevated is not completely understood. Genes encoding PI3K are frequently amplified in copy number in ovarian cancer cells, leading to activation of PI3K signaling (35Shayesteh L. Lu Y. Kuo W.L. Baldocchi R. Godfrey T. Collins C.

Phillips W.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7426-7429PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that VEGF protein expression and transcriptional activation were induced by PI3K activation in ovarian cancer. To understand the mechanism of the increased VEGF expression, we found that PI3K signaling up-regulated VEGF expression through HIF-1α. VEGF and HIF-1 are known to increase tumor growth and angiogenesis. Thus, PI3K may increase ovarian tumor growth and angiogenesis through VEGF and HIF-1 expression. To identify the downstream mediators of PI3K necessary for regulating HIF-1α and VEGF expression in ovarian cancer cells, we investigated potential downstream targets of PI3K in response to growth factor stimulation. We found that AKT was essential for VEGF transcriptional activation in the cells. In this study, we were particularly interested in the downstream targets of AKT that mediate VEGF transcriptional activation in ovarian cancer cells. We found that p70S6K1 and HDM2 are two parallel pathways that mediate growth factor-induced VEGF transcriptional activation and HIF-1α expression. These results are consistent with recent studies demonstrating that AKT activation increased HDM2 phosphorylation and its activity (41Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 42Ogawara Y. Kishishita S. Obata T. Isazawa Y. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21843-21850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). These results may provide useful information to understand VEGF and HIF-1 regulation in other human cancer cells. Overall, these results identify a novel mechanism by which the observed PI3K activation and other oncogenic signals in ovarian cancer cells may increase VEGF expression, which in turn induces angiogenesis and tumor growth. We have identified several members of the signaling molecules including AKT, HDM2, and p70S6K1 that are necessary for VEGF transcriptional activation and HIF-1α expression. This study may also provide useful information and potential targets for anti-ovarian cancer therapy in the future. We thank Dr. John Blenis and Dr. Zhi-Min Yuan (Harvard Medical School, MA) for kindly providing p70S6K1 and HDM2 constructs, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2040570333,"Besides 19,008 possible ectodomains, Drosophila Dscam contains two alternative transmembrane/juxtamembrane segments, respectively, derived from exon 17.1 and exon 17.2. We wondered whether specific Dscam isoforms mediate formation and segregation of axonal branches in the Drosophila mushroom bodies (MBs). Removal of various subsets of the 12 exon 4s does not affect MB neuronal morphogenesis, while expression of a Dscam transgene only partially rescues Dscam mutant phenotypes. Interestingly, differential rescuing effects are observed between two Dscam transgenes that each possesses one of the two possible exon 17s. Axon bifurcation/segregation abnormalities are better rescued by the exon 17.2-containing transgene, but coexpression of both transgenes is required for rescuing mutant viability. Meanwhile, exon 17.1 targets ectopically expressed Dscam-GFP to dendrites while Dscam[exon 17.2]-GFP is enriched in axons; only Dscam[exon 17.2] affects MB axons. These results suggest that exon 17.1 is minimally involved in axonal morphogenesis and that morphogenesis of MB axons probably involves multiple distinct exon 17.2-containing Dscam isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W2070814481,"Cross-talk between G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling systems is widely established in a variety of normal and transformed cell types. Here, we demonstrate that the EGFR transactivation signal requires metalloproteinase cleavage of epidermal growth factor-like growth factor precursors in fibroblasts, ACHN kidney, and TccSup bladder carcinoma cells. Furthermore, we present evidence that blockade of the metalloproteinase-disintegrin tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17) by a dominant negative ADAM17 mutant prevents angiotensin II-stimulated pro-HB-EGF cleavage, EGFR activation, and cell proliferation in ACHN tumor cells. Moreover, we found that in TccSup cancer cells, the lysophosphatidic acid-induced transactivation signal is mediated by ADAM15, demonstrating that distinct combinations of growth factor precursors and ADAMs (adisintegrin and metalloproteinases) regulate GPCR-EGFR cross-talk pathways in cell lines derived from urogenital cancer. Our data show further that activation of ADAMs results in discrete cellular responses; whereas GPCR agonists promote activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway and cell proliferation via the EGFR in fibroblasts and ACHN cells, EGFR transactivation pathways regulate activation of the survival mediator Akt/protein kinase B and the susceptibility of fibroblasts and TccSup bladder carcinoma cells to proapoptotic signals such as serum deprivation, death receptor stimulation, and the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Thus, ADAM15 and -17 function as effectors of GPCR-mediated signaling and define critical characteristics of cancer cells.

The molecular mechanisms of EGFR transactivation pathways are, however, poorly defined. In some cellular systems, the GPCR-EGFR signal transmission appears to rely on cytoplasmic, ligand-independent mechanisms (13Kraus S. Benard O. Naor Z. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32618-32630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the GPCR-EGFR cross-talk involves a triple membrane-passing signaling mechanism in COS-7 and PC-3 cells (i.e. the cell surface processing of pro-HB-EGF by metalloproteinases of the ADAM (adisintegrin and metalloproteinase) family in response to GPCR stimulation) (14Prenzel N.

High expression levels of EGFR and HER2 are associated with resistance of tumors to treatment with cytotoxic drugs (22Navolanic P.M. Steelman L.S. McCubrey J.A. Int. J.

It has been demonstrated that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt/PKB and the Ras-MAPK cascades are major downstream pathways of activated growth factor receptors mediating resistance to proapoptotic stimuli (26Samanta A.K.

Furthermore, we identify HB-EGF and ADAM17 as critical mediators of the transactivation signal in ACHN cells. Importantly, we provide evidence that GPCR-EGFR cross-talk pathways are mediated by ADAM15 in TccSup bladder carcinoma cells and regulate the susceptibility of TccSup cells and fibroblasts toward proapoptotic stimuli such as serum deprivation, death receptor activation, and chemotherapeutic agents.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—AG1478 was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals, and bradykinin was purchased from Calbiochem.

Polyclonal anti-ADAM15 antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with a peptide consisting of amino acids 757–773 of the protease.RNA Interference and Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Transfection of 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes (Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO) for targeting endogenous genes was carried out using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) and 1.9 μg of siRNA duplex per 6-well plate with 150,000 TccSup cells/well seeded 1 day ahead in serum-free medium. The expression level of ADAM metalloproteinases was monitored 48 h after transfection by enrichment of glycoproteins with concanavalin A-Sepharose and detection with ADAM antibodies as well as reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Sequences of siRNA used were CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAdTdt (control, GL2), CUCCAUCUGUUCUCCUGACdTdT and AUUGCCAGCUGCGCCCGUCdTdT (ADAM15), and GUUUGCUUGGCACACCUUdTdT and GUAAGGCCCAGGAGUGUUdTdT (ADAM17). RNA isolated using the RNeasy MiniKit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science). PuReTaq Ready-To-Go PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences) were used for PCR amplification. Primers (Sigma) were as follows: CAGCACAGCTGCCAAGTCATT and CCAGCATCTGCTAAGTCACTTCC (ADAM-17) and GCCTCTGAGCCCAGAGGCGGTGGCGATGGACACCCAGGAGCC and CAGCCCGATGGCACTCGG (ADAM15). PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel, and DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining.Cell Culture and Retroviral Infections—Rat1 fibroblasts (Genentech, Inc.) and the bladder and kidney carcinoma cell lines TccSup (DSMZ) and ACHN (ATCC) were cultured as recommended by the supplier. The pLXSN constructs encoding dominant negative ADAMs lacking the pro- and metalloproteinase domain have been described before (21Gschwind A. Hart S. Fischer O.M. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2411-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). All protease constructs included a C-terminal HA tag, detectable with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Babco). For retroviral infections, the amphotropic packaging cell line Phoenix was transfected with expression plasmids by calcium phosphate/chloroquine as described previously (30Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). 36 h after transfection, the viral supernatant was collected and used to infect subconfluent target cells (1 × 105 cells/6-cm dish). Polyclonal ACHN kidney cancer cell lines stably expressing dominant negative ADAM17 or wild type ADAM17 were generated by selecting retrovirally infected cells in medium containing G418 (1 g/ml) for 2 weeks.Stimulation of Cells, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting— Prior to lysis, cells grown to 80% confluence were serum-starved and subjected to 20-min preincubation with AG1478 (250 nm), BB94 (5 μm), or Me2SO. Next, cells were stimulated with LPA (10 μm), thrombin (2 units/ml), bradykinin (5 μm), endothelin I (100 nm), angiotensin II (1 μm), or EGF (3 ng/ml) for 3 min unless otherwise stated and lysed for 10 min on ice in HNTG buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were diluted with an equal volume of HNTG buffer and subsequently immunoprecipitated using the respective antibodies and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 4 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed three times with 0.5 ml of HNTG buffer, suspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to gel electrophoresis on 7.5% or 10% gels. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted with the respective antibodies. Signals were developed by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Filters were stripped and reprobed to confirm equal protein loading.Distribution of Cell Cycle Phases and Apoptosis Assay—Serumstarved cells (1 × 105/6-well plate) were treated with inhibitors and growth factors as indicated. Apoptosis was induced by adding doxorubicin (1 μg/ml) or anti-CD95/FasL (50 μg/ml). After the indicated time periods, cells were collected and incubated in hypotonic buffer containing 0.1% sodium acetate, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 20 μg/ml propidium iodide for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScalibur flow cytometer.Incorporation of [3H]Thymidine into DNA—Rat1 fibroblasts (1 × 105/12-well plate) and ACHN cells (1 × 104/12-well plate) were serum-starved for 18 and 48 h, respectively, and treated with inhibitors and growth factors as indicated. After 18 h, cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) for 4 h. Thymidine incorporation was measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and subsequent liquid scintillation counting.Pro-HB-EGF Ectodomain Cleavage—Pro-HB-EGF shedding was analyzed as described before (14Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were seeded at 7 × 104 cells/6-well plate, grown for 24 h, and serum-starved for 24 h. After treatment with growth factors, cells were collected and stained with ectodomain-specific antibodies against HB-EGF (R&D Systems) for 1 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies for 15 min, washed again with phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used to compare data between two groups. Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. of at least triplicate samples. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSGPCR Agonists Stimulate Cell Cycle Progression via an EGFR- and Metalloproteinase-dependent Pathway in Rat1 Fibroblasts—It has previously been demonstrated that GPCR signals lead to activation of the ERK/MAPK cascade as well as cell proliferation via the EGFR in Rat1 fibroblasts (1Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar, 31Santiskulvong C. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C886-C898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thatEGFRtransactivationpathwaysinvolveanEGF-likeligand-dependent mechanism in COS-7 cells (14Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential role of metalloproteinases in GPCR-induced mitogenesis and cell proliferation, we treated Rat1 fibroblasts with the metalloproteinase inhibitor batimastat (BB94) or the EGFR-specific tyrphostin AG1478 prior to stimulation with GPCR ligands. The results showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR and of the downstream adapter protein SHC as well as activation of the MAPK ERK1/2 in response to LPA, thrombin, bradykinin, and ET-1 was abolished by BB94 and AG1478 (Fig. 1A). Next, we investigated the effect of these inhibitors on GPCR-induced cell cycle progression of quiescent Rat1 cells by flow cytometric analysis. We found that BB94 and AG1478 completely abolished S phase progression in response to LPA, thrombin, and ET-1 (Fig. 1B). S phase entry by direct EGF stimulation, however, remained unaffected by BB94 treatment. For further quantification of mitogenic signaling in response to GPCR ligands, we measured the rate of DNA synthesis by a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. Both BB94 and AG1478 completely inhibited DNA synthesis induced by GPCR agonists (Fig. 1C). Together, these data demonstrate the critical involvement of a metalloproteinase activity in transactivation of the EGFR, downstream SHC adapter protein recruitment, activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway, and cell proliferation induced by the GPCR agonists LPA, thrombin, bradykinin, and ET-1 in Rat1 fibroblasts.EGFR Signal Transactivation Involves Distinct Combinations of ADAM Metalloproteinases and EGF-like Ligands in Kidney and Bladder Carcinoma Cell Lines—Given that metalloproteinase-dependent EGFR transactivation pathways are broadly established in Rat1 fibroblasts (Fig. 1) and COS-7 cells (14Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that metalloproteinases play functional roles in GPCR-induced transactivation of the EGFR in human cancer cells. Recently, the EGFR signaling network has been implicated in mediating critical cancer cell characteristics such as sustained cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis in tumors of the urogenital tract (32Gleave M.E. Hsieh J.T. Wu H.C. Hong S.J. Zhau H.E. Guthrie P.D. Chung L.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5300-5307PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the responsiveness of ACHN kidney cancer and TccSup bladder cancer cells to GPCR agonists. As shown in Fig. 2A, a variety of prominent GPCR ligands including angiotensin II and LPA rapidly induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in these tumor cell lines. In analogy to the data obtained in Rat1 fibroblasts (Fig. 1), BB94 abrogated the EGFR transactivation signal in ACHN and TccSup cells, whereas EGFR stimulation with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate or with EGF was not affected (Fig. 2B, top). Moreover, pretreatment of ACHN kidney cancer and TccSup bladder cancer cells with the monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody ICR-3R, which blocks binding of EGF-like ligands to the EGFR ectodomain (28Mateo C. Moreno E. Amour K. Lombardero J. Harris W. Perez R. Immunotechnology. 1997; 3: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), specifically abolished GPCR- and EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR (Fig. 2B, bottom). Together, these results demonstrate that both a metalloproteinase activity and the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the EGFR are involved in EGFR activation by GPCR stimuli and suggest the GPCR-EGFR signal transmission to occur through an EGF-like ligand-dependent mechanism in ACHN kidney and TccSup bladder carcinoma cells.Fig. 2GPCR-induced EGFR transactivation requires shedding of EGF-like ligands by ADAM17 and -15.A, ACHN kidney and TccSup bladder cancer cell were serum-starved for 48 and 24 h, respectively, and treated with various GPCR ligands (1 μm angiotensin II, 200 nm bombesin, bradykinin, 1 mm carbachol, ET-1, LPA, and thrombin) or EGF for 3 min. After immunoprecipitation (IP), the EGFR was immunoblotted (IB) with anti-phosphotyrosine (PY) and reprobed against total EGFR. B, quiescent ACHN and TccSup cells were pretreated with BB94 or the monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody ICR-3R for 1 h. Then cells were stimulated with the ligands or pervanadate (PV; 1 mm) for 3 min. Tyrosinephosphorylated EGFR was detected as described for A. C, effect of neutralizing antibodies on the transactivation signal. Quiescent TccSup or ACHN cells were preincubated with 20 μg/ml amphiregulin, 20 μg/ml HB-EGF, or 1 μg/ml TGFα-blocking antibodies for 1 h and stimulated with LPA, angiotensin II, or EGF for 3 min. The EGFR was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. D, ACHN as well as TccSup cell lines were infected with pLXSN constructs encoding dominant negative mutants (ΔMP) of ADAM10, -12, -15, and -17. Quiescent cells were stimulated with LPA, angiotensin II, or EGF for 3 min, and tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR was detected by immunoblotting (top). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs encoding ADAM15 and ADAM17, respectively. Glycoproteins from total cell lysates were enriched by precipitation with concanavalin A-Sepharose and immonoblotted against ADAM15 and ADAM17 under reduced and nonreduced SDS-PAGE conditions (middle). To show specific down-regulation of endogenous ADAMs, total lysate of TccSup cells infected with pLXSN constructs encoding ΔMP15 and -17 was enriched with concanavalin A-Sepharose and immunoblotted against ADAM15 as well as ADAM17 (*, unspecific band). To further demonstrate the specificity of the ADAM15 antiserum, TccSup cells were transfected with siRNAs against ADAM15 and -17 or control siRNA. Gene expression was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR or immunoblot with ADAM15 and -17 antibodies. Determination of the expression level of ADAM15 in A498 and ACHN kidney as well as 5637 and TccSup bladder cancer cell lines (bottom) is shown. Cell lysates containing 400 μg of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted against ADAM15. To ensure loading of equal protein amounts, the membrane was reprobed with anti-tubulin antibody. Signals were quantified using a Fuji 1000 CCD camera and the “Image Gauge” program. E, flow cytometric analysis of pro-HB-EGF ectodomain cleavage.

Preincubation with amphiregulin or TGFα-neutralizing antibodies attenuated the LPA-induced transactivation signal in TccSup cells, whereas direct stimulation of the EGFR by EGF was not affected (Fig. 2C). In ACHN cells, EGFR stimulation by angiotensin II was completely inhibited by the HB-EGF-neutralizing antibody; pretreatment with amphiregulin or TGFα blocking antibodies, however, showed no effect. These findings demonstrate that EGFR activation in response to GPCR agonists involves both TGFα and amphiregulin in TccSup bladder cancer and HB-EGF in ACHN kidney cancer cells.To identify metalloproteinases that are involved in angiotensin II and LPA-induced cleavage of EGF-like ligand precursors in ACHN and TccSup cells, respectively, we investigated the effect of dominant negative mutants of ADAM10, -12, -15, and -17 (ΔMP10, -12, -15, and -17) (21Gschwind A.

https://openalex.org/W2005456200,"Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is involved in the transfer of triglycerides, cholesterol esters, and phospholipids to newly synthesized apolipoprotein (apo) B. It is therefore essential for lipoprotein synthesis and secretion in the liver and the small intestine. Although several recent experiments have revealed the transcriptional regulation of the MTP gene, little has been revealed to date about hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4)-dependent regulation. We here report that the human MTP gene promoter contains a pair of functional responsive elements for HNF-4 and HNF-1, the latter of which is another target gene of HNF-4. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays provide evidence that endogenous HNF-4 and HNF-1 can bind these elements in chromatin. In Hep G2 cells overexpression of either a dominant negative form of HNF-4 or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against HNF-4 dramatically reduces the activities of both the wild type and the HNF-4 site mutant MTP promoter. This suggests that HNF-4 regulates MTP gene expression either directly or indirectly through elevated HNF-1 levels. When Hep G2 cells were cultured with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), a ligand for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), mRNA levels for MTP and apo B were reduced because of increased expression of the factor small heterodimer partner (SHP), which factor suppresses HNF-4 activities. Chenodeoxycholic acid, but not a synthetic FXR ligand, attenuated expression of HNF-4, bringing about a further suppression of MTP gene expression. Over time the intracellular MTP protein levels and apo B secretion in the culture medium significantly declined. These results indicate that two nuclear receptors, HNF-4 and FXR, are closely involved in MTP gene expression, and the results provide evidence for a novel interaction between bile acids and lipoprotein metabolism.

These findings clearly indicate that changes in MTP activities under various physiological conditions can modulate lipoprotein production and secretion in the liver and intestine. HNF-4 is a highly conserved member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. It is a liver-enriched transcription factor that, together with other factors, plays a key role in the tissue-specific expression of a large number of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. The active form of HNF-4 is a homodimer, and it does not appear to heterodimerize with other members of the nuclear receptor family. Recent investigations have shown that coenzyme A derivatives of certain fatty acids activate the receptor, and these derivatives thus have been characterized as endogenous ligands for HNF-4 (9Hertz R. Mangeheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 10Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23988-23999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A crucial role for HNF-4 in metabolic homeostasis was demonstrated by the finding that mutations in the HNF-4 gene cause the disorder known as maturity onset diabetes of the young (11Yamagata K.

Conditional HNF-4 gene knock-out mice, which were produced using the Cre-loxP method with an albumin-Cre transgene, exhibit a great reduction in serum cholesterol and triglycerides because of the decreased levels of MTP and several apolipoproteins (12Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.-H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Although this result indicates that MTP gene expression is under the control of HNF-4, little is known about the specific step. It has been shown that the transcriptional activity of HNF-4 is regulated by interaction with small heterodimer partner (SHP), an atypical negative nuclear receptor lacking a DNA-binding domain (13Seol W.

SHP, induced by FXR together with bile acids, controls the transcriptional activity of several other nuclear receptors including the constitutive androstane receptor, thyroid receptor, retinoid X receptor (RXR), retinoic acid receptor, estrogen receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, the liver X receptor, and the liver receptor homolog-1 (14Lee Y.K.

Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30708-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to examine the effect of bile acids, which activate FXR and eventually induce SHP gene expression, on the HNF-4-dependent transcription of the MTP gene. We here show that MTP gene expression is regulated by HNF-4 and HNF-1, which bind to the individual responsive element in the promoter of the human MTP gene. We also demonstrate that bile acids can down-regulate MTP transcription by impairing the transactivation potential of HNF-4 through the interaction with SHP and suppressing HNF-4 gene expression. In response to attenuated HNF-4 activity the transcription of other HNF-4-responsive genes including HNF-1 and apo B is also reduced, leading to decreased VLDL secretion. Taken together, this evidence suggests that bile acids are able to control lipoprotein synthesis and secretion via the FXR- and HNF-4-mediated pathways. Materials—CDCA, anti-FLAG M2 antibody, and lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) were purchased from Sigma. An FXR ligand, GW4064, was custom synthesized. Cell Culture—Hep G2 and HEK293 cells were cultured with a medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in collagen-coated dishes as described previously (23Sato R. Okamoto A. Inoue J. Miyamoto W.

An expression construct of a dominant negative (DN) form of HNF-4, pDN-HNF4, which lacks the 110 amino acids from Arg2 to Gln111, was made from pHNF4. To generate plasmids of human HNF-1α (pHNF1) and SHP (pSHP), 1.9- and 1.8-kb fragments obtained by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA from Hep G2 cells were ligated into a pME18S vector (25Sato R.

An expression plasmid pGal4-HNF4 was constructed by inserting the fragment encoding human HNF-4α2 into a Gal4 DNA-binding domain expression vector, pM (Clontech).

All of the mutant reporter constructs (pMTP-AKO, -BKO, and -CKO and pMTPΔHNF1) were synthesized by a PCR-assisted method using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. All of the mutant HNF-4 and HNF-1 sites were replaced by the sequence shown by the italicized letters in Fig. 1. To generate pHNF4-1000, an 1-kb fragment containing the 5′-flanking region of the human gene (–1014 to +55) was inserted into a pGL3 basic vector (Promega).

HEK293 cells were transfected with 0.2 μg of the indicated reporter construct, 0.01 μg of pRL-CMV, an expression plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase (Promega), and 0.6 μg of either pHNF4 or pHNF1. Hep G2 cells were transfected with 2 μg of the indicated reporter construct and 0.1 μg of pRL-CMV. In reporter assays in Fig. 8, Hep G2 cells were cultured with a medium containing 10% charcoalstripped FBS (20Nakahara M. Fujii H. Maloney P.R. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol.

After incubation for 48 h, the Dual-Luciferase™ reporter system (Promega) was used to determine luciferase activity. When Hep G2 cells were transfected with siRNA expression constructs, cells were harvested after 72 h of incubation. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (24Misawa K. Horiba T. Arimura N. Hirano Y. Inoue J. Emoto N. Shimano H. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol.

To obtain recombinant HNF-4, HNF-1, and DN-HNF-4, HEK293 cells were transfected with one of the expression constructs, pFLAG-HNF4, pHNF1, or pDN-HNF4, and then their nuclear extracts were prepared. 32P-Labeled DNA probes (5′-GCGCTGGGCAAAGGTCACCTGC-3′) containing a consensus HNF-4 binding sequence (28Ueda A. Takeshita F. Yamashiro S. Yoshimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19339-19347Google Scholar), (5′-CTGCAGCCCACCTACGTTTAATCATTAATAGTGAGCCCTTCAG-3′) corresponding to the HNF-1 binding site of the human MTP gene, (5′-AGTGACTGGTTACTCTTTAACGTATCCAC-3′) containing a consensus HNF-1 binding sequence, and (5′-GATTTTGGAGTTTGGAGTCTGACCTTTC-3′) corresponding to the HNF-4 B site in the human MTP promoter were used. In competition assays, excess amounts of unlabeled fragments (30-, 100-, or 300-fold) were added prior to addition of the labeled probe. Northern Blot Analysis—Hep G2 cells were set up on day 0 in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. On day 1, the medium was removed, and the cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and refed with medium A containing 5% LPDS supplemented with the indicated concentration of CDCA. After a 6-, 12-, 18-, or 24-h culture, total RNA was extracted, and Northern blotting was performed as described previously (20Nakahara M. Fujii H. Maloney P.R. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol.

Western Blot Analysis—Hep G2 cells were cultured as described above. On day 1, the cells were refed with medium A containing 5% LPDS supplemented with 100 or 200 μm CDCA. On day 5, the cells were harvested, and Western blot analysis was carried out using a polyclonal antibody against human MTP (RS001, Ref. 25Sato R. Miyamoto W. Inoue J. Terada T. Imanaka T. Maeda M.

To analyze apo B secretion, on day 4, the cells were refed with the same medium, and then the culture medium was collected on day 5. Western blot analysis was performed using a polyclonal antibody against human apo B (Chemicon International Inc.) as described previously (20Nakahara M. Fujii H. Maloney P.R. Shimizu M. Sato R. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 16809-16819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—Hep G2 cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 10 min, lysed, and sonicated (29Arimura N. Horiba T. Imagawa M. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10070-10076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Soluble chromatin prepared with a ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against acetyl histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology), human HNF-4α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8987), human HNF-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8986), or the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-575). Purified samples were used as templates for PCR performed for 44 cycles. Oligonucleotide primers composed of the sequences 5′-GTGAGAGACTGAAAACTGCAGC-3′ and 5′-CATCCAGTGCCCAGCTAGGAG-3′ (205 bp) for MTP (upstream and downstream) were used for PCR. HNF-4-dependent Regulation of the Human MTP Promoter— As it has been reported that all of the putative positive and negative response elements for the liver-specific MTP gene expression are localized within the human MTP promoter –142 bp region (30Hagan D.L. Kienzle B. Jamil H. Hariharan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28737-28744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we focused on the promoter activity of the first 200 bp 5′ to the transcription start site to identify the cis acting element for HNF-4. We found three putative HNF-4-responsive elements in this region (Fig. 1) and performed luciferase assays using wild type or mutant versions of reporter genes to confirm certain functional element(s) among them. When Hep G2 cells, which endogenously express HNF-4, were transfected with one of the reporter genes, the luciferase activities were significantly decreased only by disruption of the B site (Fig. 2A). When HEK293 cells were transfected, the promoter activity was undetectable unless an HNF-4 expression plasmid was introduced, suggesting that HNF-4 is responsible for cell type-specific expression of the MTP gene (Fig. 2B). Only mutation at the B site elicited a tremendous suppression of luciferase activities in the presence of HNF-4. These results indicate that the B site is important for the HNF-4-dependent induction of the MTP promoter activity. HNF-4 Can Bind to the B Site in the Human MTP Promoter— Next, gel mobility shift assays were performed to demonstrate direct binding of HNF-4 to the B site. Fig. 3 shows that a nucleotide probe that carried the binding sequence for HNF-4 (28Ueda A. Takeshita F. Yamashiro S. Yoshimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19339-19347Google Scholar) was shifted after the addition of nuclear extracts of HEK293 cells transfected with an expression plasmid for FLAG-tagged HNF-4 and was supershifted by the addition of anti-FLAG antibodies (lanes 1–3). Excess amounts of unlabeled A site or C site probes (wild type and mutant forms) did not affect the formation of DNA-HNF-4 complex (Fig. 3, lanes 4–6 and lanes 10–12). However, the addition of excess amounts of an unlabeled B site probe (wild type), but not the mutant variant, inhibited the formation of the complex (Fig. 3, lanes 7–9), suggesting that the –49 to –61 region is a binding site for HNF-4. These results are in good accord with the results in Fig. 2. HNF-1-dependent Regulation of the Human MTP Promoter— Because there exists a putative HNF-1-responsive element in the 200-bp promoter region (Fig. 1), we examined whether this site is functional. Reporter assays showed that the luciferase activities in Hep G2 cells transfected with a mutant version of reporter gene lacking the HNF-1-responsive element were much lower than those with a wild type reporter gene (Fig. 4A). To determine whether HNF-1 can bind to the putative HNF-1-responsive element, gel shift assays were performed with a nucleotide probe covering this element. A specific protein-DNA complex, which was not detected with the nuclear extracts from mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4B, lane 1), was detected in the presence of the nuclear extracts from FLAG-HNF-1-expressing cells (lane 2). This band was migrated to the same position as a control complex with a probe containing a consensus HNF-1 binding sequence (Fig. 4B, lane 6). The addition of excess amounts of unlabeled wild type probe (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4) inhibited the formation of the complex, whereas the addition of unlabeled mutant probe did not affect it (lane 5). These results clearly indicate that the –98 to –111 region is a binding site for HNF-1 and crucial for the MTP promoter activity. To investigate whether both endogenous HNF-1 and -4 bind to the MTP promoter, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 4C, endogenous HNF proteins bound to the promoter of the MTP gene (second and third lanes). An unrelated anti-Gal4 DNA-binding domain antibody did not generate any PCR products (Fig. 4C, fourth lane). These data indicate that MTP gene expression is driven by the binding of endogenous HNF-1 and -4 to the individual responsive element in chromatin. Endogenous HNF-4 Plays a Crucial Role for MTP Gene Expression—Although Figs. 2 and 3 clearly show that the MTP promoter activity requires both the HNF-4 and HNF-1 functions, we do not know how these factors coordinately regulate MTP gene expression. HNF-1 has been shown to be a direct transcriptional target of HNF-4 in liver (31Kuo C. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Therefore, one reasonable hypothesis is that HNF-4 stimulates MTP gene expression indirectly by increasing HNF-1 levels, which in turn activates the MTP promoter. To confirm the role of HNF-4, we constructed an expression plasmid for DN-HNF-4 that possesses a functional domain but lacks a DNA-binding domain and therefore suppresses the activity of endogenous HNF-4. As shown in gel mobility shift assays (Fig. 5A), a complex of HNF-4 and a probe containing the B site in the MTP promoter (lane 1) was replaced by the addition of excess amounts of DN-HNF-4 (lane 4), suggesting that this dominant negative form suppresses the activity of HNF-4. To distinguish a direct action of HNF-4 from an indirect action mediated through HNF-1, we compared the activity of wild type and mutant promoters in the presence or absence of DN-HNF-4 in Hep G2 cells (Fig. 5B). The activities of wild type and ΔHNF1 promoters significantly declined by expression of DN-HNF-4 through the intact B site. Furthermore, expression of DN-HNF-4 led to reduction in the activity of the promoter with the mutation in the HNF-4 site, confirming that HNF-4 also stimulates MTP gene expression through an indirect effect via HNF-1. Alternatively, endogenous HNF-4 functions were repressed by specific siRNAs, which had already been shown to be effective in our previous report (24Misawa K. Horiba T. Arimura N. Hirano Y. Inoue J. Emoto N. Shimano H. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36176-36182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It turns out that quite similar results were obtained by both methods, i.e. weakening of endogenous HNF-4 activities (Fig. 5, B and C). Although in these assay systems it is difficult to compare quantitatively the direct with the indirect action of HNF-4, the significant effects of DN-HNF-4 and siRNAs clearly indicate that both actions are substantial. CDCA Affects MTP Gene Expression—It has been shown that CDCA induces SHP gene expression through activation of FXR and that SHP in turn inactivates HNF-4 functions (14Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Taking into account the fact that apo B is also one of the target genes for HNF-4, it might be that bile acids reduce MTP-mediated secretion of apo B-containing lipoproteins from hepatocytes. To investigate this possibility, Hep G2 cells were cultured with a medium containing CDCA for 24 h, and Northern blot analyses were carried out. Because of a long cascade from FXR to MTP through SHP and HNF-4, we analyzed changes in mRNA levels for several genes up to 24 h so as not to overlook any effects of CDCA (Fig. 6). In addition, because we had demonstrated previously that CDCA activates the MAPK pathway (20Nakahara M. Fujii H. Maloney P.R. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37229-37234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the cells were cultured with the indicated CDCA concentration to stimulate this pathway. As shown in Fig. 6, after a 6-h incubation, only mRNA levels for SHP, a target gene of FXR, were upregulated, whereas the others were unaffected. MTP mRNA levels were reduced after 12 h and longer incubation with 100 μm CDCA, and the levels were reduced more robustly with 200 μm CDCA. Similar patterns were observed in terms of apo B, HNF-1, and HNF-4, which are all direct transcriptional targets of HNF-4. These results imply that the FXR-mediated activation of SHP might lead to suppression of HNF-4 target gene expression. It is likely that SHP mRNA levels were reduced after 24 h because of a self-regulatory mechanism (32Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjas K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). SHP Suppresses Transcription of the MTP Gene—To investigate the direct effect of SHP on MTP promoter activity, luciferase assays were performed. When Hep G2 cells were transfected with an SHP expression plasmid, the MTP promoter activity was reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A). It appears that overexpressed SHP directly inhibits HNF-4 activities. To confirm an SHP-mediated reduction of HNF-4 activit"

The 2-hydroxylation occurs during de novo ceramide synthesis and is catalyzed by fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (also known as fatty acid α-hydroxylase). In mammals, 2-hydroxysphingolipids are present abundantly in brain because the major myelin lipids galactosylceramides and sulfatides contain 2-hydroxy fatty acids. Here we report identification and characterization of a human gene that encodes a fatty acid 2-hydroxylase. Data base searches revealed a human homologue of the yeast ceramide 2-hydroxylase gene (FAH1), which we named FA2H. The FA2H gene encodes a 372-amino acid protein with 36% identity and 46% similarity to yeast Fah1p. The amino acid sequence indicates that FA2H protein contains an N-terminal cytochrome b5 domain and four potential transmembrane domains. FA2H also contains the iron-binding histidine motif conserved among membrane-bound desaturases/hydroxylases. COS7 cells expressing human FA2H contained 3–20-fold higher levels of 2-hydroxyceramides (C16, C18, C24, and C24:1) and 2-hydroxy fatty acids compared with control cells. Microsomal fractions prepared from transfected COS7 cells showed tetracosanoic acid 2-hydroxylase activities in an NADPH- and NADPH: cytochrome P-450 reductase-dependent manner. FA2H lacking the N-terminal cytochrome b domain had little activity, indicating that this domain is 5a functional component of this enzyme. Northern blot analysis showed that the FA2H gene is highly expressed in brain and colon tissues. These results demonstrate that the human FA2H gene encodes a fatty acid 2-hydroxylase. FA2H is likely involved in the formation of myelin 2-hydroxy galactosylceramides and -sulfatides. 2-Hydroxysphingolipids are a subset of sphingolipids containing 2-hydroxy fatty acids.

Sphingolipids are a large class of lipids found in all eukaryotic cells and are involved in a variety of cellular processes. The structural diversity of sphingolipids stems from over 300 known distinct head groups as well as modifications of the hydrophobic ceramide moiety. One of the common modifications of the ceramide moiety is 2-hydroxylation of the N-acyl chain. Sphingolipids with 2-hydroxy fatty acid are found in most organisms including plants, yeast, worms, vertebrate animals, and some bacterial species. In mammals, 2-hydroxy fatty acid-containing sphingolipids are uniquely abundant in nervous and epidermal tissues. In mammalian central and peripheral nervous systems, galactosylceramides and sulfatides (3-sulfate ester of galactosylceramide) are major lipid components of myelin (1Nonaka G. Kishimoto Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 572: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 2Norton W.T. Cammer W. Morell P. Myelin. Plenum Press, New York1984: 147-195Crossref Google Scholar). These glycosphingolipids contain a high proportion (∼50%) of 2-hydroxy fatty acid (3Hoshi M. Williams M. Kishimoto Y. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and are critical components of myelin (4Stoffel W. Bosio A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 654-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 5Coetzee T. Suzuki K. Popko B. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 126-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In mammalian epidermal tissues, there are several unique, very long chain ceramides with 2-hydroxy fatty acids, which are critical for the permeability barrier function of epidermis (6Wertz P.W. Downing D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 759-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Downing D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 301-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several biophysical studies (8Pascher I. Sundell S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1977; 20: 175-191Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 9Boggs J.M. Koshy K.M. Rangaraj G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 938: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Lofgren H. Pascher I. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1977; 20: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the 2-hydroxyl group in sphingolipids has a profound effect in the lipid organization within membranes because of its hydrogen-bonding capability. The participation of the 2-hydroxyl group in hydrogen bonds with neighboring lipids was shown by analysis of the crystal structure of synthetic glycosphingolipids with 2-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (8Pascher I. Sundell S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1977; 20: 175-191Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and by analysis of the phase transition temperature (9Boggs J.M. Koshy K.M. Rangaraj G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 938: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The monolayer behavior of synthetic ceramides showed that the 2-hydroxyl group promotes condensation to a close-packed arrangement (10Lofgren H. Pascher I. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1977; 20: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These studies provide a physical basis for the effects of 2-hydroxysphingolipids in biomembranes. The 2-hydroxylation of sphingolipid N-acyl chains occurs during de novo ceramide synthesis and is catalyzed by the enzyme fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (also known as fatty acid α-hydroxylase). Biochemical properties of this enzyme have been studied in rat brain postnuclear (11Hoshi M. Kishimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4123-4130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or microsomal fractions (12Akanuma H. Kishimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1050-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rat brain fatty acid 2-hydroxylase requires molecular oxygen, Mg2+, pyridine nucleotides (NADPH or NADH), and a microsomal electron transport system (13Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 14Shigematsu H. Hisanari Y. Kishimoto Y. Int. J. Biochem. 1990; 22: 1427-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Insensitivity to carbon monoxide indicates that the rat brain fatty acid 2-hydroxylase is not a P-450 enzyme but another type of mixed function oxidase (11Hoshi M. Kishimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4123-4130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae most sphingolipids contain 2-hydroxy fatty acid. The 2-hydroxylation is dependent on the FAH1 (also known as SCS7) gene, which has been identified as a gene containing a cytochrome b5-like sequence (15Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28281-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and as a suppressor of the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype of csg2 mutants (16Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Yeast fah1 mutants show increased resistance to pore-forming antifungal agents, presumably because of altered plasma membrane properties (17Hama H. Young D.A. Radding J.A. Ma D. Tang J. Stock S.D. Takemoto J.Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Yeast Fah1p is a member of the membrane-bound desaturase/hydroxylase family with the conserved histidine motif (HX(3–4)HX(7–41)HX(2–3)-HHX(61–189)(H/Q)X(2–3)HH), which is thought to coordinate a non-heme di-iron cluster at an active site (13Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The reactions catalyzed by the enzymes in this family require electron donors and molecular oxygen (13Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). For yeast Fah1p, the terminal electron donor is likely the intramolecular cytochrome b5 domain. It is notable that the predicted properties of yeast Fah1p are consistent with the biochemical properties of rat brain fatty acid 2-hydroxylase. Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that mammalian fatty acid 2-hydroxylases are encoded by FAH1 homologues. Here we report identification and characterization of the human FA2H gene, which was identified based on the sequence similarity to the yeast FAH1 gene. Fatty acid 2-hydroxylase activity was found in COS7 cells expressing the human FA2H gene. Materials—Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Atlanta Biologicals (Norcross, GA). [α-32P]dCTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Deuterated (3,3,5,5-D4)-tetracosanoic acid was purchased from Larodan Fine Chemicals (Malmö, Sweden). A synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 20 amino acids of FA2H (NH2-KLWDYCFHTLTPEKPHLKTQ-COOH) was synthesized by AnaSpec (San Jose, CA). Anti-hFA2H polyclonal antibodies for the C-terminal peptide were generated in rabbits and affinity purified using immobilized antigen. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) 1The abbreviations used are: HRP, horseradish peroxidase; GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.-linked anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies (A8592) were purchased from Sigma. HRP-linked sheep anti-mouse IgG (NXA931), HRP-linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934), and the ECL Western blotting detection reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Goat anti-rabbit cytochrome b5 antibodies (RDI-CYTOB5abG) and HRP-linked donkey anti-goat IgG antibodies (RDI-705035147) were purchased from Research Diagnostics, Inc. (Flanders, NJ). Purified human cytochrome b5 was purchased from PanVera (Madison, WI). Purified human NADPH:P-450 reductase and NADPH regenerating system solutions were purchased from BD Biosciences. Cell Culture—COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose and l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Human FA2H Expression Plasmid—A human gene with significant similarity to the yeast FAH1 gene was identified by BLAST analyses. A human FA2H cDNA clone was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC no. MGC-10804). The original data base entry indicated the open reading frame starting at the methionine 93 (Fig. 1). The FA2H open reading frame was amplified accordingly by PCR using a pair of oligonucleotides (5′-GCAGGGATCCATGGAGAACGAGCCTGTAGC-3′ and 5′-TGGGAATTCTCACTGCGTCTTCAGGTGGGG-3′), which were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into pBluescript II vector, resulting in pBS-hFA2HΔN. Later, a sequence comparison among the human, mouse, and rat homologues revealed an N-terminal extension of 92 amino acids corresponding to a cytochrome b5 domain. To create a full-length recombinant human FA2H containing the N-terminal cytochrome b5 domain, a 276-bp NcoI fragment corresponding to the N-terminal 92 amino acids was inserted into the NcoI site of pBS-hFA2HΔN, resulting in pBS-hFA2H. Following sequence verification, the two versions of FA2H (hFA2HΔN and hFA2H) were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), resulting in pcDNA3-hFA2HΔN and pcDNA3-hFA2H, respectively. To introduce an N-terminal FLAG tag, the BamHI-EcoRI fragment of pBS-hFA2H was subcloned into pYES2-FLAG (18Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawski J. Becker K.P. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Hu W. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31184-31191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), resulting in pYES2-FLAG-hFA2H. The FLAG-hFA2H fragment was cut out with HindIII and EcoRI and subcloned into pcDNA3, resulting in pcDNA3-FLAG-hFA2H. Transfection—COS7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3, pcDNA3-hFA2H, pcDNA3-hFA2HΔN or pcDNA3-FLAG-hFA2H using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection by trypsin-EDTA treatment for lipid analyses or were directly lysed in 6-well culture dishes for Western blot analyses. Cell Fractionation—COS7 cells were transfected in 6-well culture dishes. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were harvested by trypsin-EDTA treatment, resuspended in a solution of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and lysed by freezing-thawing followed by sonication (amplitude 29%, 5 s on, 0.1 s off, 12 cycles) (Fisher Sonic Dismembrator Model 500). Cell lysate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove unbroken cells and large debris. The supernatant (low speed supernatant) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h to separate the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) and the pellet (membrane fraction). Western Blot Analysis—COS7 cells were transfected in 6-well culture dishes. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with 100 μl of SDS-PAGE lysis buffer/well (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 25 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with HRP-linked anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies (1:500) or anti-human FA2H polyclonal antibodies (1:1000) followed by incubation with HRP-linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000). Protein bands were detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents. For detection of cytochrome b5, goat anti-rabbit cytochrome b5 antibodies and HRP-linked donkey anti-goat IgG antibodies were used. Purified human cytochrome b5 was used as a positive control. Ceramide Determination by Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Approximately 1 × 106 COS7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-hFA2H, harvested by trypsin-EDTA treatment, and washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and phosphate-buffered saline. Internal standards were added to the cells, and lipids were extracted with ethyl acetate/isopropanol/water (60:30:10, v/v). A small aliquot of each lipid extract was set aside for phosphate quantitation. Lipid extracts were evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in 100 μl of methanol. The reconstituted samples were injected onto a Thermo Finnigan Surveyor liquid chromatography system with a BDS Hypersil C8 column (150 × 3.2 mm, 3-μm particle size) and eluted with a mobile phase consisting of 1 mm methanolic ammonium formate and 2 mm aqueous ammonium formate. Electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectroscopic analysis of ceramides was performed on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in a multiple reaction monitoring positive ionization mode. Peaks of the target analytes and internal standards were collected and processed using the Xcalibur software system. Calibration curves were constructed by plotting peak area ratios of the target analyte to their respective internal standard against concentration using a linear regression model. Lipid phosphates were determined by the method of Van Veldhoven and Bell (19Van Veldhoven P.P. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 959: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Ceramide contents were normalized to the lipid phosphate. Fatty Acid Determination by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry—COS7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-hFA2H, harvested, and lysed as described above. Crude cell lysate (0.5 ml) was mixed with a set of internal standards (C15, C17, C19, C21, and C23 fatty acids), and free fatty acids were extracted three times with 1 ml of diethyl ether. Combined diethyl ether extracts were dried under nitrogen. To prepare fatty acid methyl esters, 1 ml of anhydrous methanolic HCl was added to each sample and incubated at 65 °C for 45 min, and samples were dried under nitrogen. To prepare trimethylsilyl derivatives of hydroxyl groups, 100 μl of Tri-Sil reagent (Pierce) was added to each sample and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. One to 2 μl of each sample was applied to a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph with a Restek RTX-5 column (5% diphenyl, 95% dimethyl polysiloxane, 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25 μm D.F., 30 m). The injection port and the transfer line were maintained at 250 °C, and the oven temperature was increased from 110 to 300 °C at 10 °C/min. Mass spectra data were obtained on a VG-70S magnetic sector mass spectrometer. Peaks of the target analytes and internal standards were collected and processed using the Opus software system (Micromass Information Systems, Modesto, CA). Calibration curves were constructed by plotting peak area ratios of the target analytes to their respective internal standard against concentration, using linear regression analysis. Fatty Acid 2-Hydroxylase Assay—Membrane fractions were prepared as described under “Cell Fractionation.” Membrane pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of the lysis buffer by brief sonication in a bath sonicator. The assay mixture contained microsomal fractions (100 μg of proteins), 2.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1.28 mm NADP+, 3.3 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 3.3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 unit of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1 μg of human NADPH:cytochrome P-450 reductase, and 1 μg (2.7 nmol) of (3,3,5,5-D4)-tetracosanoic acid (stock solution was prepared as 10 μg/ml in 1.5 mm α-cyclodextrin) in a total volume of 1.5 ml. The assay mixture was placed in a 50-ml polypropylene tube and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with shaking (100 rpm) to facilitate the diffusion of oxygen. At the end of incubation, 50 pmol of C23 fatty acid (internal standard) was added to each sample, and fatty acids were extracted three times with 2 ml diethyl ether. The combined diethyl ether extracts were brought to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. Fatty acids were derivatized and quantified as described under “Fatty Acid Determination by GC/MS.” The ions monitored for 2-hydroxy-(3,3,5,5-D4)-tetracosanoic acid had a mass of 415 and 459, corresponding to M-15 and M-59, respectively. The activities were calculated as picomoles of 2-hydroxy-(3,3,5,5-D4)-tetracosanoic acid/mg of protein/min. Northern Blot Analysis—Premade Northern blots containing poly(A)+ RNA from human tissues (Clontech) were probed with FA2H cDNA or a human β-actin control cDNA. The FA2H cDNA probe was a 862-bp fragment obtained by PCR with oligonucleotides FA2H-FBam (5′-GCAGGGATCCATGGAGAACGAGCCTGTAGC-3′) and FA2H-RR1 (5′-TGGGAATTCTCACTGCGTCTTCAGGTGGGG-3′). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Identification of Human FA2H Gene—BLAST sequence analyses identified several human cDNA sequences that had significant similarity to yeast FAH1 (also known as SCS7), a gene required for 2-hydroxylation of sphingolipid-associated very long chain fatty acids (15Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28281-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 20Dunn T.M. Haak D. Monaghan E. Beeler T.J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). All the cDNA clones were derived from the same gene located in the human chromosome 16 (NCBI locus identification, 79152), which we named FA2H for fatty acid 2-hydroxylase. The FA2H gene product is a 372-amino acid protein (42.8 kDa) that has 36% identity and 46% similarity to yeast Fah1p (Fig. 1). Yeast Fah1p contains an N-terminal cytochrome b5 domain (NCBI conserved domain data base accession no. 22935), four potential transmembrane domains, and the characteristic histidine motif conserved among membrane-bound desaturases/hydroxylases (consensus: HX(3–4)HX(7–41)HX(2–3)-HHX(61–189)(H/Q)X(2–3)HH) (13Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 15Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28281-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Dunn T.M. Haak D. Monaghan E. Beeler T.J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These histidines are thought to coordinate the non-heme di-iron cluster at an active site (13Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Similarly, human FA2H protein contains a cytochrome b5 domain at its N terminus (amino acids 1–92). Within this domain is the conserved heme-binding domain (His-Pro-Gly-Gly), suggesting that it is functional as an electron carrier. The cytochrome b5 domains of yeast Fah1p and human FA2H lack a membrane anchor, which is present in the microsomal cytochrome b5. The C-terminal three quarters of FA2H are highly homologous to the sphingolipid fatty acid hydroxylase domain (NCBI conserved domain data base accession no. 9675). This domain is found in previously identified FAH1 homologues in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Caenorhabditis elegans (15Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28281-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), as well as in hypothetical proteins in the fungi Magnaporthe grisea and Neurospora crassa, the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, Drosophila melanogaster, the nematode C. briggsae, Xenopus laevis, Mus musculus, and Rattus norvegicus (NCBI conserved domain architecture retrieval tool). All of these proteins contain the eight conserved histidines (Fig. 1, consensus sequence asterisks) and an N-terminal cytochrome b5 domain with the exception of the A. thaliana homologue, which lacks a cytochrome b5 domain (15Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28281-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). 2-Hydroxyceramides and 2-Hydroxy Fatty Acids in COS7 Cells Expressing Human FA2H—To show that human FA2H is involved in the formation of 2-hydroxysphingolipids, the levels of ceramides and 2-hydroxyceramides in COS7 cells transfected with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-hFA2H were determined. Total cellular lipids were extracted 24 h after transfection, and ceramides were fractionated on a reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography column and quantified by a tandem mass spectrometer. Fig. 2 shows the levels of ceramides and 2-hydroxyceramides with five different fatty acid chain lengths. Ceramides with normal (non-hydroxy) fatty acids are comparable with or slightly decreased in FA2H-expressing cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 2A). Cellular 2-hydroxyceramides in FA2H-transfected cells increased 3–20-fold, except for 2-hydroxyceramide C20:0 (Fig. 2B). The levels of 2-hydroxyceramides continued to increase after 24 h and reached as much as 40-fold over control cells in 72 h in the case of C16:0 ceramide (data not shown). These results provide evidence that FA2H is involved in the formation of 2-hydroxysphingolipids. The fatty acid 2-hydroxylation is believed to occur prior to ceramide synthesis in mammals. However, it has not been clearly demonstrated whether 2-hydroxylation occurs on free fatty acids. To determine whether 2-hydroxylation occurs on free fatty acids, we measured free 2-hydroxy fatty acids in control and FA2H-transfected cells along with non-hydroxy fatty acids. Because free 2-hydroxy fatty acids were expected to be minor species, a high-resolution GC/MS assay was developed for the quantification of the fatty acids. 2-Hydroxy fatty acids were derivatized as trimethylsilyl ether of methyl esters. Fig. 3 shows the mass spectrum of trimethylsilyl ether of 2-hydroxytetracosanoic acid methyl ester. Electron impact ionization generated two distinct ions with masses of 411 and 455 (Fig. 3, inset). The limit of detection by this method was at the femtomol level. Using this method, non-hydroxy and 2-hydroxy fatty acids were quantified in transfected COS7 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, non-hydroxy fatty acid levels were indistinguishable between control and FA2H-transfected cells. Consistent with the presence of 2-hydroxyceramides shown in Fig. 2, low levels of 2-hydroxy fatty acids were present in control cells. Among the six different free 2-hydroxy fatty acids analyzed, the levels were 2.3–5.4-fold higher in FA2H-transfected cells over control cells, except for C20 fatty acid (1.5-fold). The highly elevated free 2-hydroxy fatty acid levels are consistent with the possibility that FA2H-dependent 2-hydroxylation occurs on free fatty acids.Fig. 4Fatty acids and 2-hydroxy fatty acids in transfected COS7 cells. Fatty acids were extracted from COS7 cell transfected with pcDNA3 (open bars) or pcDNA3-hFA2H (filled bars). Non-hydroxy fatty acids (A) and 2-hydroxy fatty acids (B) were quantified by GC/MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The average and standard deviation of three measurements are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Western Blot Analysis—The amino acid sequence of human FA2H indicated that it was a membrane-bound, 43-kDa protein. There was another potential translation initiation site at methionine 93, which had been noted as a translation initiation site in some data base entries for the same gene. Interestingly, methionine 93 is located between the N-terminal cytochrome b5 domain and the sphingolipid fatty acid hydroxylase domain. It is conceivable that translation initiation at methionine 93 produces a catalytically active 33-kDa protein, based on the fact that the Arabidopsis homologue, lacking a cytochrome b5 domain, is active when expressed in yeast (15Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28281-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To test whether the cytochrome b5 domain is necessary for catalytic activity of recombinant human FA2H, full-length and truncated FA2H, starting from methionine 1 and methionine 93, respectively, were constructed. FLAG-tagged FA2H was also constructed to confirm the presence of the N-terminal portion with anti-FLAG antibodies. When expressed in COS7 cells, the three versions of FA2H were 43, 33, and 44 kDa, as expected (Fig. 5A). There was no detectable endogenous FA2H in COS7 cells, indicating low abundance of endogenous FA2H in these cells and/or poor conservation of the C-terminal portion of FA2H, which was used to generate the antibodies. Western blot with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies detected FLAG-tagged FA2H, confirming that the entire N-terminal portion is present in this construct (Fig. 5B). The overexpressed FA2H was exclusively fractionated in the membrane fraction (Fig. 5C) as expected from the presence of four putative transmembrane domains. Anticytochrome b5 antibodies did not cross-react with the full-length human FA2H expressed in COS7 cells (data not shown). In Vitro Fatty Acid 2-Hydroxylase Activity—To show that FA2H-dependent 2-hydroxylation occurs on free fatty acids, we have developed a sensitive and specific in vitro assay using GC/MS for the detection of reaction products. Based on previous studies (14Shigematsu H. Hisanari Y. Kishimoto Y. Int. J. Biochem. 1990; 22: 1427-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 21Shigematsu H. Kishimoto Y. Int. J. Biochem. 1987; 19: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) of the rat brain enzyme, fatty acid 2-hydroxylation is coupled with a microsomal electron transport system involving NADH:cytochrome b5 reductase or NADPH: cytochrome P-450 reductase. The requirement of an electron transport system is also predicted from the presence of the cytochrome b5 domain in the human FA2H protein. Because NADPH is a more effective electron donor than NADH for the rat brain enzyme (21Shigematsu H. Kishimoto Y. Int. J. Biochem. 1987; 19: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), our assay system included purified recombinant human NADPH:cytochrome P-450 reductase and an NADPH regeneration system (NADP+, glucose 6-phosphate, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). With these components, electron transport would occur in the following sequence: NADPH → NADPH:cytochrome P-450 reductase → cytochrome b5 domain of FA2H → the catalytic di-iron of FA2H. Because human FA2H is a membrane-bound protein as shown above, microsomal fractions of transfected COS7 cells were used as enzyme sources. To distinguish exogenously added substrate from endogenous fatty acids present in microsomal fractions, we used a deuterated fatt"
https://openalex.org/W2169961890,"Rhodopsin (Rho) resides within internal membrane structures called disc membranes that are found in the rod outer segments (ROS) of photoreceptors in the retina. Rho expression is essential for formation of ROS, which are absent in knockout Rho-/- mice. ROS of mice heterozygous for the Rho gene deletion (Rho+/-) may have a lower Rho density than wild type (WT) membranes, or the ROS structure may be reduced in size due to lower Rho expression. Here, we present evidence that the smaller volume of ROS from heterozygous mice is most likely responsible for observed electrophysiological response differences. In Rho+/- mice as compared with age-matched WT mice, the length of ROS was shorter by 30–40%, and the average diameter of ROS was reduced by ∼20%, as demonstrated by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Together, the reduction of the volume of ROS was ∼60% in Rho+/- mice. Rho content in the eyes was reduced by ∼43% and 11-cis-retinal content in the eye was reduced by ∼38%, as determined by UV-visible spectroscopy and retinoid analysis, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained disc membranes from Rho+/- mice indicated a typical morphology apart from the reduced size of disc diameter. Power spectra calculated from disc membrane regions on such electron micrographs displayed a diffuse ring at ∼4.5 nm-1, indicating paracrystallinity of Rho. Atomic force microscopy of WT and Rho+/- disc membranes revealed, in both cases, Rho organized in paracrystalline and raftlike structures. From these data, we conclude that the differences in physiological responses measured in WT and Rho+/- mice are due to structural changes of the whole ROS and not due to a lower density of Rho.

Transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained disc membranes from Rho+/- mice indicated a typical morphology apart from the reduced size of disc diameter. Power spectra calculated from disc membrane regions on such electron micrographs displayed a diffuse ring at ∼4.5 nm-1, indicating paracrystallinity of Rho. Atomic force microscopy of WT and Rho+/- disc membranes revealed, in both cases, Rho organized in paracrystalline and raftlike structures. From these data, we conclude that the differences in physiological responses measured in WT and Rho+/- mice are due to structural changes of the whole ROS and not due to a lower density of Rho.

The mechanistic view of how these receptors operate is complicated by the fact that only the crystal structure of inactive, dark-adapted Rho has been available in the last few years (3Krebs A.

Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and their micromolecular assembly has been deduced from low resolution radiation inactivation experiments (12Schlegel W. Kempner E.S. Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5168-5176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The classical hypothesis for GPCR operation proposes formation of a one-to-one complex between a GPCR and a G protein. Arguments for this model include activity of the receptor in a very dilute detergent-containing medium where a single receptor per micelle is assumed to be present per G protein. A multitude of biophysical measurements such as rotational and lateral mobility studies of Rho, electron paramagnetic resonance, and fluorescence measurements were explained in the light of a one-to-one complex (e.g. see Ref. 13Chabre M. Cone R. Saibil H. Nature. 2003; 426: 30-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, peptide competition experiments were interpreted in a framework of one-to-one complexes (reviewed in Ref. 14Hargrave P.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3-9PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative hypothesis, now rapidly gaining acceptance, proposes that the dimers of GPCRs are the interacting units with a single trimeric G-protein. A set of biochemical and biophysical methods have addressed the question on the oligomeric state of GPCRs, and hetero- and homodimers of GPCRs were observed in a number of experiments (15Angers S.

The best studied system for GPCR signaling has been the visual system of rod photoreceptors, which are highly differentiated neurons. Rho, the light receptor molecule of rod photoreceptor cells, resides within internal membrane structures called disc membranes, which are located in the rod outer segment (ROS) and are enveloped by the plasma membrane (reviewed in Refs. 26Filipek S. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Palczewski K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 851-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar and 27Molday R.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 2491-2513PubMed Google Scholar). A single ROS consists of a large number of these discs, ranging from ∼900 in mouse to ∼2000 in frog photoreceptors. In addition to its signaling role, Rho is also a structural protein, because its presence at a very high concentration (∼3 mm) is essential for the normal development of ROS and disc membranes. Direct AFM imaging of Rho in native membranes revealed that the protein is organized in large paracrystalline structures with a dimeric elementary unit (28Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Nature. 2003; 426: 31Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 29Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K.

Nature. 2003; 421: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The size of the platform formed by the dimer provides the structural fit of the GPCR with a single G-protein or arrestin (32Ridge K.D. Abdulaev N.G. Sousa M. Palczewski K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 33Filipek S. Krzysko K.A. Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 628-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A molecular model of arrangement of rhodopsin in the membranes was proposed (29Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 30Liang Y. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Palczewski K. Engel A. J. Biol.

Photobiol. Sci. 2004; 3: 628-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This model is consistent with the biochemical results obtained on the organization of α1-adrenergic receptor (34Carrillo J.J. Lopez-Gimenez J.F. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, crosslinking studies confirmed that Rho forms dimers and/or higher order structures in native membranes (35Medina R. Perdomo D. Bubis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39565-39573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition to early biophysical studies that suggested unobstructed diffusion of Rho in the native membranes (13Chabre M. Cone R. Saibil H. Nature. 2003; 426: 30-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), phototransduction events were investigated in heterozygote mice with the Rho gene deletion (36Calvert P.D. Govardovskii V.I. Krasnoperova N. Anderson R.E. Lem J. Makino C.L. Nature. 2001; 411: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Calvert et al. (36Calvert P.D. Govardovskii V.I. Krasnoperova N. Anderson R.E. Lem J. Makino C.L. Nature. 2001; 411: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) speculated that a high packing density of Rho may impede phototransduction by restricting the lateral movement and decreasing the rate of encounters between Rho and its cognate G protein. The authors found that the heterozygous knockout of Rho in transgenic mice accelerated the rising phases and recoveries of flash responses by about 1.7-fold in vivo. From these findings, they suggested that the response onset and recovery are set by the diffusional encounter frequency between proteins on the disc membrane. Here, we employed a number of structural methods to investigate the differences between wild type (WT) and Rho+/- mice and to understand how lower expression of Rho impacts the structure and physiology of photoreceptor cells. We found that the reduction in the Rho expression level leads to morphological and structural changes of the ROS. All animal experiments employed procedures approved by the University of Washington Animal Care Committee. Rho+/- and WT C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Dr. J. Lem (Tufts University, Boston, MA) and the Jackson Laboratory, respectively. Rho+/- mice were genotyped as described previously (37Lem J. Krasnoperova N.V. Calvert P.D. Kosaras B. Cameron D.A. Nicolo M. Makino C.L. Sidman R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). All animals (12 weeks old) were maintained in complete darkness for >120 min before being sacrificed. The eyes were removed, and the retinas were isolated in complete darkness with the aid of night vision goggles (LAMBDA 9; ITT Industries). Twelve mouse retinas were placed in a tube with 120 μl of 8% OptiPrep (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway) in Ringer's buffer (130 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 2.4 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and 0.02 mm EDTA) and vortexed for 1 min. The sample was centrifuged at 200 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant containing the ROS was gently removed. The pellet was dissolved in 120 μl of 8% OptiPrep, vortexed, and centrifuged again. The vortex and sedimentation sequence was repeated six times. The collected supernatants (∼1.5 ml) containing ROS were combined, overlaid on a 10–30% continuous gradient of OptiPrep in Ringer's buffer, and centrifuged for 50 min at 26,500 × g. ROS were harvested as a second band (about two-thirds of the way from the top), diluted three times with Ringer's solution, and centrifuged for 3 min at 500 × g to remove the cell nuclei. The supernatant containing ROS was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged for 30 min at 26,500 × g. The pelleted material contained pure, osmotically intact ROS. ROS were burst in 2 ml of 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at 0 °C or at room temperature for 15 h, and the discs were isolated employing a 15–40% continuous gradient of OptiPrep in Ringer's buffer. The sample was centrifuged for 50 min at 26,500 × g and the discs were collected from a faint band located about two-thirds of the way from the top of the gradient. The harvested intact discs were diluted three times with Ringer's solution and pelleted for 30 min at 26,500 × g. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (38Ohguro H. Chiba S. Igarashi Y. Matsumoto H. Akino T. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3241-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mouse eyecups were primarily fixed by immersion in 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m cacodylate sodium buffer (pH 7.3) for 24 h. The eyecups were then washed with 0.1 m cacodylate sodium buffer and secondarily fixed with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m cacodylate sodium buffer. ROS and discs were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 1% OsO4, 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) for 1 h, washed three times with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, and collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 3 min. ROS and disc pellets were suspended in molten 5% phosphate-buffered low temperature gelling agarose solution, collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 3 min, and cooled. ROS and disc pellets were secondarily fixed with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The eyecups, ROS, and discs were dehydrated with ethanol and embedded in Eponate12 Resin (Ted Pella, CA). Thin sections (1.0 μm) were cut, stained with 10% Richardson's blue solution, and subjected to light microscopy. Ultrathin sections (0.07 μm) were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate solution. Samples were inspected, and electron micrographs were recorded with a Philips CM-10 TEM. The retinas without the retinal pigment epithelium cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m cacodylate sodium buffer, 2% sucrose (pH 7.4) for 6 h. All samples were washed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, 2% sucrose, fixed with 1% OsO4 in washing buffer, dehydrated with ethanol, dried using a critical point drying method, sputter-coated with a 5–10-nm-thick gold layer, and analyzed employing a JSF-6300F or a XL SFEG scanning electron microscope (FEI Sirion; Philips). Disc membranes were adsorbed to mica in 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) for 15–20 min at room temperature and washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2. AFM experiments were performed in the dark with a Nanoscope Multimode AFM (Veeco/Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with a red laser head, fluid cell, and oxide-sharpened silicon nitride cantilevers (OMCL-TR400PSA; Olympus), calibrated as described previously (39Muller D.J. Amrein M. Engel A. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 172-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Topographs were acquired in contact mode at minimal loading forces (≤100 piconewtons). Trace and retrace signals were recorded simultaneously at line frequencies ranging between 4.1 and 5.1 Hz. All procedures were performed under dim red light as described previously (40Van Hooser J.P. Aleman T.S. He Y.G. Cideciyan A.V. Kuksa V. Pittler S.J. Stone E.M. Jacobson S.G. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12012-12019Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Retinoids were separated by normal phase HPLC (Beckman; Ultrasphere-Si; 4.6 × 250 mm) with 10% ethyl acetate, 90% hexane at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min using an HP1100 HPLC system with a diode array detector and HP Chemstation A.03.03 software. Typically, two mouse eyes were used per Rho measurement. Mouse eyes were enucleated and rinsed with distilled H2O. The lenses were removed, and the eyes were cut into 3–4 pieces and frozen immediately on a dry ice/EtOH bath. Rho was extracted with 0.9 ml of 20 mm BisTris propane (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm dodecyl-β-maltoside and 5 mm freshly neutralized NH2OH·HCl. The sample was homogenized with a Dounce tissue homogenizer and shaken for 5 min at room temperature (Eppendorf mixer 5432). The sample was then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5415C). The supernatant was collected, and the pellet was extracted one more time. The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 10 min (Beckman Optima TLX centrifuge/TLA100.3 fixed angle rotor), and absorption spectra were recorded before and after a 12-min bleach (60-watt incandescent bulb). The concentration of Rho was determined by the decrease in absorption at 500 nm using the molar extinction coefficient ϵ = 42,000 m-1 cm-1. Prior to recording, mice were dark-adapted overnight. Under a safety light, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection using 20 μl/g body weight of 6 mg/ml ketamine and 0.44 mg/ml xylazine diluted with 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm NaCl. The pupils were dilated with 1% tropicamide. A contact lens electrode was placed on the eye, and a reference electrode and ground electrode were placed in the ear and on the tail. ERGs were recorded with the universal testing and electrophysiologic system UTAS E-3000 (LKC Technologies, Inc.). The light intensity was calibrated by the manufacturer and computer-controlled. The mice were placed in a Ganzfeld chamber, and scotopic and photopic responses to flash stimuli were each obtained from both eyes simultaneously. Single-flash Recording—Flash stimuli had a range of intensities (-3.7–2.8 log cd s m-2), and white light flash duration was adjusted according to intensity (from 20 μs to 1 ms). Three to five recordings were made with >10-s intervals, and for higher intensity intervals, intervals were 10 min or as indicated. There were no significant differences between the first and the fifth flash. Light-adapted responses were examined after bleaching at 1.4 log cd m-2 for 15 min. Typically, 4–8 animals were used for the recording of each point in all conditions. Double-flash Recording—The double-flash recording was used to study the recovery of photoreceptors. The protocol was followed as previously published with some modifications (43Howes K.A. Pennesi M.E. Sokal I. Church-Kopish J. Schmidt B. Margolis D. Frederick J.M. Rieke F. Palczewski K. Wu S.M. Detwiler P.B. Baehr W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1545-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A test flash was delivered to suppress the circulating current of the rod photoreceptors. The recovery of this current was monitored by delivering a second flash, termed the probe flash. The interval time between two flashes was varied from 100 to 2000 ms. The intensity of the test flash and probe flash was 0.4 and 1.6 log cd s m-2, respectively. Each trial was performed separately with a 120-s interval time for dark adaptation. The amplitude of the probe flash alone was confirmed throughout the experiment to ensure that this time was sufficient. These probe flashes were also used to normalize the response of probe flashes following a test flash. The normalized amplitude of the probe flash a-wave versus the time between two flashes was plotted and fitted by the linear regression algorithm in the SigmaPlot 2002 version 8.02 program. Leading edges of the ERG responses were fitted with a model of rod phototransduction activation as described previously (40Van Hooser J.P. Aleman T.S. He Y.G. Cideciyan A.V. Kuksa V. Pittler S.J. Stone E.M. Jacobson S.G. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8623-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The results were examined using the one-way analysis of variance test. Visual Responses in Rho+/- Mice—The mice used in our experiments were originally generated by Lem et al. (37Lem J. Krasnoperova N.V. Calvert P.D. Kosaras B. Cameron D.A. Nicolo M. Makino C.L. Sidman R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological single cell recordings from rod photoreceptors of Rho+/- mice were consistent with the earlier finding by Calvert et al. (36Calvert P.D. Govardovskii V.I. Krasnoperova N. Anderson R.E. Lem J. Makino C.L. Nature. 2001; 411: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) that the transgenic mice displayed accelerated kinetics of rod responses and higher sensitivity. 2F. Rieke and K. Palczewski, unpublished results. To further characterize photoreceptor activities, dark- and light-adapted Rho+/- mice were tested using an ERG. Fig. 1A illustrates subsets of a typical family of ERG responses to Ganzfeld stimuli at a wide range of intensities for dark-adapted WT and Rho+/- mice. The initial corneal-negative a-wave reflecting photoreceptor activities plotted for the entire range of the test light showed slightly lower amplitude for Rho+/- mice, particularly at higher light intensities (Fig. 1B). Lower a-wave amplitudes also evoked a smaller amplitude of the b-wave (Fig. 1B), representing responses of the secondary retinal neurons. The leading edges of the a-wave of the ERG responses in dark-adapted conditions were fitted with a model of rod phototransduction activation as described previously (40Van Hooser J.P. Aleman T.S. He Y.G. Cideciyan A.V. Kuksa V. Pittler S.J. Stone E.M. Jacobson S.G. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8623-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and two parameters, maximum a-wave amplitude and sensitivity, were calculated. Rho+/- mice showed significantly higher sensitivity (p < 0. 01), whereas maximum a-wave amplitude revealed no significant difference (p > 0.1) compared with WT mice (Table I). Cone responses, as measured in light-adapted conditions when rods were desensitized by the background light, revealed an unchanged a-wave; however, noticeable differences were observed for the b-wave (Supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). The difference in the b-wave could result from the differences initiated by abnormal rod function (e.g. a lower density of rods), but the connection remains unclear.Table IQuantitative parameters of ERG a-wave ERG were recorded as described under “Materials and Methods.” Leading edges (initial 5–20 ms depending on response) of dark-adapted ERG photoresponses evoked by 2.8 log cd s m-2 flashes are fitted with a model of phototransduction. The amplitude and sensitivity of the Rho+/- mouse photoresponses are reduced from maximal responses. The time for 50% recovery of a-wave Rho+/- mice was estimated from normalized a-wave recovery. Rho+/- show significantly higher sensitivity and faster recovery. Maximum a-wave amplitude, sensitivity parameters, and time for 50% recovery of a-wave in Rho+/- mice compared with WT mice are shown.WTRho+/-Maximum a-wave amplitude (μV)964.6 ± 48.4818.4 ± 67.3Sensitivity (log cd-1 m2 s-3)4.8 ± 0.56.1 ± 0.17ap < 0.01, one-way analysis of variance, when compared with WT miceTime between flashes for 50% a-wave amplitude recovery (ms)893.3 ± 47.8469.7 ± 14.2bp < 0.0001, one-way analysis of variance, when compared with WT micea p < 0.01, one-way analysis of variance, when compared with WT miceb p < 0.0001, one-way analysis of variance, when compared with WT mice Open table in a new tab The rod function was further examined using paired flash responses. Whereas the test flash desensitized rod photoreceptors, the probe light measured the sensitivity of rods during the course of Rho* inactivation and recovery of prebleach conditions (Fig. 2A). The time for 50% recovery of the a-wave was estimated using normalized a-wave amplitude recovery time. Photoreceptors in Rho+/- mice recovered significantly faster compared with WT (p < 0. 0001; Rho+/-, 469.7 ± 14.2 ms; WT, 893.3 ± 47.8 ms) after the test flash (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the recovery of sensitivity was significantly faster for Rho+/- mice. Morphological Differences—To understand the underlying reasons for the measured physiological differences in rods from WT and Rho+/- mice, a full morphological characterization of the retina, including Rho content and retinoid levels, was carried out. Light microscopy of the retina from WT and Rho+/- mice revealed the most profound changes in the outer segments (Fig. 3A). For example, the thickness of OS was plotted as a distance from the optic nerve head in the superior and inferior direction (see Fig. 3B). In mice, this layer is constituted mostly of rod cells, since the cone component is only ∼3% (44Carter-Dawson L.D. LaVail M.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1979; 188: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 45Carter-Dawson L.D. LaVail M.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1979; 188: 245-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The ratio of OS layer lengths in the retina of WT and Rho+/- mice was 1.72 ± 0.37 across the retina. Similar results were obtained when nasal and temporal sections were analyzed (data not shown). This morphological observation suggests a reduction of the length of ROS by ∼40% in Rho+/- mice compared with those of WT mice. There was a slight change in the thickness of the outer plexiform layer and the number of photoreceptor nuclei, from ∼11–12 per row in WT (n = 12) to 9–10 per row in Rho+/- (n = 12 eyes). The change in the thickness of OS should result in a decreased number of rods and thus decrease in Rho content in the retina. If the density of Rho was unchanged, a shortening of the ROS would result in a proportional decrease in the Rho content. Rho in mice can be measured very precisely by retinoid analysis, since the majority of the 11-cis-retinal pool is bound to opsin in the eye (46McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The retinoid analysis revealed that the eye extract from Rho+/- mice had 325 ± 28 pmol/eye or ∼38% reduction of 11-cis-retinal compared with 527 ± 21 pmol/eye for the age-matched eye extract from WT mice (n = 6). A typical chromatogram is shown in Fig. 4. Rho amounts were also measured employing difference spectra calculated from spectra measured before and after bleaching. The homogenate from the retina of Rho+/- had 320 ± 35 pmol/eye of Rho, a ∼43% decrease in comparison with the 560 ± 33 pmol/eye from the age-matched retinal extract from WT mice (n = 8).

In addition, stability of IFNAR1 is regulated by its binding to Tyk2 kinase. Here we characterize the determinants of IFNAR1 ubiquitination and degradation. We found that the integrity of two Ser residues at positions 535 and 539 within the specific destruction motif present in the cytoplasmic tail of IFNAR1 is essential for the ability of IFNAR1 to recruit β-Trcp as well as to undergo efficient ubiquitination and degradation. Using an antibody that specifically recognizes IFNAR1 phosphorylated on Ser535 we found that IFNAR1 is phosphorylated on this residue in cells. This phosphorylation is promoted by treatment of cells with IFNα. Although the cytoplasmic tail of IFNAR1 contains seven Lys residues that could function as potential ubiquitin acceptor sites, we found that only three (Lys501, Lys525, and Lys526), all located proximal to the destruction motif, are essential for ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR1. Expression of Tyk2 stabilized IFNAR1 in a manner that was dependent neither on its binding to β-Trcp nor IFNAR1 ubiquitination. We discuss the complexities and specifics of the ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR1, which is a β-Trcp substrate that undergoes degradation via a lysosomal pathway.

We discuss the complexities and specifics of the ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR1, which is a β-Trcp substrate that undergoes degradation via a lysosomal pathway. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis plays an important regulatory role in many biological processes including cell cycle progression, transcription, and signal transduction (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar). The process of protein ubiquitination is catalyzed by three distinct enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligases (E3). The E1 enzyme activates ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent reaction and then transfers ubiquitin to an E2. The E2 enzyme then cooperates with an E3 ligase to catalyze the formation of an isopeptide bond between ubiquitin and substrate. E3 ligases, which bind both cognate E2 and the substrates, are responsible for conferring substrate specificity in the ubiquitination reaction. Proteins polyubiquitinated by these enzymes are degraded by the 26 S proteasome (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar, 2Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). Alternately, oligo- or monoubiquitinated transmembrane proteins are endocytosed and degraded via the lysosomal pathway (3Terrell J. Shih S. Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol.

Recently we have shown that the SCFβ-Trcp E3 ubiquitin ligase mediates ligand-induced ubiquitination of the IFNAR1 subunit of the type I interferon receptor complex.

This mechanism plays a pivotal role in the negative regulation of IFN signaling (9Kumar K.G. Tang W. Ravindranath A.K. Clark W.A. Croze E. Fuchs S.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5480-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box) E3 ligases represent the best studied family of E3s known so far (10Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Members of the F-box protein family β-transducin repeat-containing proteins (β-Trcp, including β-Trcp1 and β-Trcp2/HOS) interact with Skp1 via the 42–48-amino acid F box motif and bind phosphorylated substrates through C-terminal WD40 repeats to mediate ubiquitination of their substrates, including inhibitors of NF-κB (IκB), β-catenin, and others that contain the DSG(XX)2+nS destruction motif (Fig. 1, reviewed in Ref. 11Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Kumar K.G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Substrates of β-Trcp-dependent ubiquitination are characterized by phosphorylation of Ser residues within the destruction motif (11Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Kumar K.G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Whereas the integrity of Ser535 within the IFNAR1 destruction motif is essential for its ubiquitination and degradation (9Kumar K.G. Tang W. Ravindranath A.K. Clark W.A. Croze E. Fuchs S.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5480-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the importance of the second Ser residue (Ser539) remains obscure. Our previous findings suggest that down-regulation of IFNAR1 in response to type I IFN is promoted by phosphorylation of IFNAR1. However, there is no definitive report that IFNAR1 is actually phosphorylated on Ser535 in a ligand-dependent manner. Apart from phosphorylation, the efficiency of protein substrate ubiquitination depends on the availability of ubiquitin acceptor sites. Unlike many substrates of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which can be promiscuously ubiquitinated on various Lys residues (e.g. c-Jun, Ref. 12Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), substrates of the SCFβ-Trcp E3 ligases are preferentially ubiquitinated on lysines that are located proximal to the destruction motif. Data from recent structural studies of this complex indicate the requirement for such Lys residues as ubiquitin acceptor sites and predict that the lysine destruction motif spacing serves as a determinant of ubiquitination efficiency (13Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the case of IκBα, a pair of lysines (Lys21,22) have been shown to act as ubiquitin acceptor sites. These are necessary and sufficient to support ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα (Fig. 1) (14Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11259-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Similarly positioned Lys19, within human β-catenin, is required for β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation (13Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Furthermore, introduction of analogous Lys residues into the Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1, which is a pseudosubstrate of β-Trcp, converts this protein into a substrate for β-Trcp-mediated ubiquitination and degradation by the 26 S proteasome (15Tang W. Pavlish O.A. Spiegelman V.S. Parkhitko A.A. Fuchs S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48942-48949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be seen whether a similar preference for ubiquitin acceptor sites exists in other β-Trcp substrates, such as IFNAR1 (9Kumar K.G. Tang W. Ravindranath A.K. Clark W.A. Croze E. Fuchs S.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5480-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and prolactin receptor (16Li Y. Kumar K.G. Tang W. Spiegelman V.S. Fuchs S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4038-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which are degraded through the lysosomal pathway. In human cells, internalization and lysosomal degradation of IFNAR1 is also regulated by its binding to the Janus kinase family member Tyk2. The interaction between IFNAR1 and Tyk2 sustains the cell surface localization of IFNAR1 and is required for maintaining the overall expression levels of IF-NAR1. Interestingly, the kinase activity of Tyk2 is not required for this function (17Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G. Richter M.F. Uze G. Ling L. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11839-11844Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Ragimbeau J. Dondi E. Alcover A. Eid P. Uze G. Pellegrini S.

A. 2000; 97: 8991-8996Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although it is tempting to speculate that Tyk2 may affect the IFNAR1 turnover either by inhibiting β-Trcp-mediated ubiquitination or independently of β-Trcp, these possibilities remain to be investigated. Because of its membrane location, IFNAR1 is expected to impose potentially novel structural constraints for ubiquitination by SCFβ-Trcp E3 ligase; such constraints might not be present in the cytoplasmic or nuclear substrates of β-Trcp. Therefore, it is of major importance to understand the structural determinants that contribute to the ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR1. In this study, we characterize IFNAR1 as a substrate for the SCFβ-Trcp E3 ligase and identify such determinants. We show that both Ser535 and Ser539 residues within the DSGNYS destruction motif are required for recognition of IFNAR1 by β-Trcp as well as for ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR1. Phosphorylation of Ser535 is induced by treatment of cells with IFNα. Furthermore, we identify the specific Lys residues that are essential for IFNAR1 ubiquitination and proteolysis. In addition, we demonstrate that Tyk2 binds to IFNAR1 and stabilizes this receptor subunit without interfering with β-Trcp-mediated IFNAR1 ubiquitination and in a manner that is independent of IFNα. Plasmids—Constructs for expression of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged β-Trcp2/HOS, HA-tagged Tyk2, and FLAG-tagged human IFNAR1 (wild-type and S535A mutant) were previously described (9Kumar K.G. Tang W.

Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from D. Bohmann. Site-directed mutagenesis of FLAG-IFNAR1wt cDNA was carried out using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The integrity of all resulting mutants was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfections—293T and HeLaS3 cells were kindly provided by Z. Ronai. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and high humidity. Transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations 36 h prior to harvesting. The amount of plasmid DNA was equalized in all transfection reaction by adding empty vector (pCDNA3, Invitrogen). Antibodies and Immunotechniques—Antibodies against HA (Roche Applied Science), FLAG (M2, Sigma), and IFNAR1 (H-11, Santa Cruz) were purchased. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were carried out as previously described (21Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Xiong Y. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A phospho-Ser535 antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated Ser535 within the DSGNYS motif of human IFNAR1 was raised in rabbits using synthetic monophosphopeptide EDHKKYSSQTSQDpSGNYSNEDESES (522–546) in collaboration with PhosphoSolutions Inc. (Golden, CO). Antibody was further affinity purified using monophosphopeptide affinity columns and tested for specificity by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting reactions. To determine phosphorylation of endogenous IFNAR1, 293T cells were treated with IFNα (500 units/ml) for the indicated time, harvested, and subjected to denaturing lysis by boiling in 1% SDS-containing Tris-buffered saline, followed by sonication. After 10-fold dilution with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, lysates were incubated with protein A beads for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged. Supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation with phospho-Ser535 antibody and immunoblotting analysis with IFNAR1 antibody. Digital images were processed with Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assays—293T cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and FLAG-tagged IFNAR1 plasmids. Cells were subjected to denaturing lysis as described previously (16Li Y. Kumar K.G. Tang W. Spiegelman V.S. Fuchs S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4038-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and analyzed by immunoprecipitations with M2 antibody followed by immunoblotting with HA antibody to detect ubiquitinated IFNAR1 proteins. The blots were stripped and re-probed with M2 antibody to detect IFNAR1. Pulse-Chase Analysis—Pulse-chase analysis was carried out with 293T cells as described elsewhere (9Kumar K.G. Tang W. Ravindranath A.K. Clark W.A. Croze E. Fuchs S.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5480-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 16Li Y. Kumar K.G. Tang W. Spiegelman V.S. Fuchs S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4038-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in 100-mm diameter dishes and transfected with the indicated plasmids. After starvation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and cysteine and metabolic labeling with a [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), cells were harvested at various time points of a chase with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%) and unlabeled methionine and cysteine (2 mm). Lysates from harvested cells were immunoprecipitated with M2 antibody, separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. Ser Residues within the Destruction Motif of IFNAR1 Are Required for β-Trcp Binding, Ubiquitination, and Degradation—We have recently found that β-Trcp mediates the ubiquitination, endocytosis, and lysosomal degradation of IFNAR1. Our findings implicated the integrity of Ser535 within the putative destruction motif 534DSGNYS539 in the recognition of IFNAR1 by β-Trcp and suggested that phosphorylation of Ser residues within this motif is required for this recognition (9Kumar K.G. Tang W. Ravindranath A.K. Clark W.A. Croze E. Fuchs S.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5480-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A similar extracellular stimuli-induced phosphorylation of Ser32,36 within IκBα induces its interaction with β-Trcp (23Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4058) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether analogous Ser535 and Ser539 residues are required for interaction between IFNAR1 and β-Trcp. To test this possibility we generated the IFNAR1S539A mutant and compared its binding to β-Trcp with the wild-type receptor by co-immunoprecipitating FLAG-tagged IFNAR1 and HA-tagged β-Trcp2 that had been co-expressed in 293T cells. We found that, consistent with our earlier data (9Kumar K.G. Tang W. Ravindranath A.K. Clark W.A. Croze E. Fuchs S.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5480-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), β-Trcp2 interacted with IFNAR1wt but did not bind to the IFNAR1S535A mutant (Fig. 2A, upper panel, lane 2 versus 3). Similar to the IFNAR1S535A protein, the IFNAR1 mutant that harbors the Ser539 substitution to Ala also failed to bind to β-Trcp (Fig. 2A, upper panel, lane 4). These results suggest that both Ser535 and Ser539 are important for β-Trcp binding to IFNAR1. We next examined the ubiquitination of these mutant receptors. Co-expression of HA-tagged ubiquitin and FLAG-tagged IFNAR1 in 293T cells followed by denaturing lysis and immunoprecipitation allowed us to detect ubiquitination of IFNAR1 in vivo (Fig. 2B). In agreement with our earlier observations (9Kumar K.G. Tang W. Ravindranath A.K. Clark W.A. Croze E. Fuchs S.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5480-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the extent of ubiquitination of IFNAR1S535A was decreased compared with that of IFNAR1wt (Fig. 2B, lane 4 versus 5). In addition, we observe a noticeable decrease in the extent of ubiquitination of IFNARS539A (Fig. 2B, lane 6). Given an important role of β-Trcp in the ubiquitination of IFNAR1 (9Kumar K.G. Tang W. Ravindranath A.K. Clark W.A. Croze E. Fuchs S.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5480-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), these results further indicate that both Ser535 and Ser539 residues within the destruction motif of IFNAR1 are required for E3 ligase recruitment and β-Trcp-mediated ubiquitination of IFNAR1. Ubiquitination of IFNAR1 in a β-Trcp-dependent manner was shown to target IFNAR1 for degradation (9Kumar K.G. Tang W. Ravindranath A.K. Clark W.A. Croze E. Fuchs S.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5480-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To examine whether mutation of Ser539 within the DSGNYS motif would affect the stability of IFNAR1, we carried out pulse-chase analysis. Consistently with our previous studies, IFNAR1wt was degraded efficiently whereas degradation of IFNAR1S535A was noticeably delayed. Remarkably similar to IFNAR1S535A, IFNAR1S539A exhibited substantial stabilization compared with IFNAR1wt (Fig. 2C). These results, together with the co-immunoprecipitation data and in vivo ubiquitination experiments suggest that, similar to the requirement of both Ser residues in IκB and β-catenin, the integrity of both Ser535 and Ser539 is crucial for the interaction of β-Trcp with IFNAR1, as well as for ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR1. Phosphorylation of IFNAR1 on Ser535 Is Promoted by Ligand Treatment—It has been well documented that phosphorylation of Ser residues within the DSG(X)2+nS motif is a prerequisite for the binding of β-Trcp to its substrates such as IκB, β-catenin, ATF4, Emi1, and others (11Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Kumar K.G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We previously found that the interaction between IFNAR1 and β-Trcp also depends on IF-NAR1 phosphorylation and that this interaction is promoted by treatment of cells with IFNα. We hypothesized that recruitment of β-Trcp by IFNAR1 (followed by its ubiquitination and down-regulation) is a result of IFNAR1 phosphorylation on Ser residues within the destruction motif by an as yet to be identified IFNα-activated kinase. To investigate whether ligand-induced phosphorylation of Ser residues within the DSGNYS motif of IFNAR1 indeed occurs in cells, we used a polyclonal antibody that would specifically recognize IFNAR1 phosphorylated on Ser535. This antibody was raised against a synthetic phosphopeptide encompassing the DpSGNYS motif and then affinity purified. We carried out experiments to characterize this reagent using FLAG-tagged IFNAR1 proteins expressed in 293T cells and purified with anti-FLAG antibody. These experiments showed that the antibody indeed specifically recognizes IFNAR1 phosphorylated on Ser535 but not on Ser539 in both immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 3A). We then investigated the phosphorylation status of endogenous IFNAR1. HeLaS3 (chosen for these experiments because they express higher levels of endogenous IFNAR1 than 293T cells) 2K. G. S. Kumar and S. Y. Fuchs, unpublished observations. were stimulated with IFNα (1000 units/ml) for the indicated times, and immunoprecipitation was carried out on the cell lysates using the antiphospho-Ser535 antibody, followed by immunoblotting with an antibody against IFNAR1. We found that IFNα promotes the phosphorylation of IFNAR1 within 15–30 min of treatment (Fig. 3B). This result (along with the data indicating that integrity of Ser535 is essential for IFNAR1 binding to β-Trcp as well as ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR1, see Fig. 2) suggests a mechanism for the ligand-dependent down-regulation of IFNAR1 that involves IFNα-stimulated phosphorylation of IFNAR1 within the destruction motif followed by recruitment of β-Trcp and ubiquitination of IFNAR1. Three Lys Residues Located Proximally to the Destruction Box Are Essential for IFNAR1 Ubiquitination and Degradation—Previous studies on cytoplasmic substrates of the SCFβ-Trcp E3 ligase demonstrated the requirement for acceptor lysines that are positioned appropriately from the recognition motif (11Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Kumar K.G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In the case of IκBα, two adjacent lysines (Lys21 and Lys22) positioned 10 and 9 residues upstream of the destruction motif have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for ubiquitination and degradation (14Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11259-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Also, structural studies using a β-catenin-derived phosphopeptide as a substrate, which contains acceptor lysines positioned similarly to IκBα, indicated that the rate of ubiquitination depends on the proper positioning of the lysines in proximity for the ubiquitin transfer from E2 enzymes (13Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the ubiquitination acceptor lysine residues and the precise mechanism of ubiquitination of membrane receptor substrates such as IFNAR1 remain to be determined. The cytoplasmic tail of IFNAR1 consists of 100 amino acids with a total of seven lysine residues including Lys458, Lys473, Lys488, Lys501, Lys525, Lys526, and Lys547 (Fig. 1). We noted that Lys525 and Lys526 within the cytoplasmic tail of IFNAR1 are located approximately at the same position from the destruction motif as seen in IκBα (Fig. 1) and β-catenin. Thus, we investigated whether these lysines act as ubiquitin acceptor sites in IFNAR1. To this end, we created a FLAG-tagged IFNAR1K525R/K526R mutant by site-directed mutagenesis and analyzed the effect of this mutation on receptor stability and ubiquitination. FLAG-tagged IFNAR1 proteins were expressed in 293T cells and their stability was analyzed by pulsechase assay. Surprisingly the IFNAR1K525R/K526R mutant protein did not exhibit any change in stability and was degraded as efficiently as the wild-type receptor (Fig. 4A). However, an additional mutation of Lys501 stabilized the triple IFNAR1K501R/K525R/K526R mutant whereas the single IFNAR1K501R mutant underwent efficient degradation (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that three Lys residues at positions 501, 525, and 526 are essential for IFNAR1 proteolysis. We next examined the ubiquitination of various IFNAR1 lysine mutants. In vivo ubiquitination of exogenously expressed IFNAR1 receptors was assessed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mutation of lysine 501 alone did not result in noticeable changes in the efficiency of ubiquitination of this mutant (Fig. 4B). Whereas the extent of ubiquitination of the IFNAR1K525R/K526R protein was noticeably reduced compared with IFNAR1wt, the IFNAR1K501R/K525R/K526R mutant exhibited an even more substantial decrease in the extent of its ubiquitination (Fig. 4B). This result suggests that the three Lys residues at positions 501, 525, and 526 are essential for ubiquitination of IFNAR1 in vivo. We next investigated the possibility that these Lys-Arg substitutions bring about gross structural changes in the receptor that might affect its interaction with β-Trcp, and thereby result in reduced ubiquitination and degradation. To this end, we assessed the binding of β-Trcp2 to the IFNAR1K501R/K525R/K526R mutant using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 4C, efficiency of β-Trcp2 binding to the IFNAR1K501R/K525R/K526R mutant was similar to the interaction between β-Trcp2 and the wild-type IFNAR1. This finding indicates that an inhibitory effect of the Lys-Arg substitutions on IFNAR1 ubiquitination and turnover does not arise from the lack of binding to β-Trcp. Together with results of the pulse-chase analysis and in vivo ubiquitination assays, these data suggest a role for Lys at positions 501, 525, and 526 as potential ubiquitin acceptor sites in ubiquitin conjugation to IFNAR1 mediated by β-Trcp. Tyk2 Increases the Level of IFNAR1 Independently of the Ability of IFNAR1 to Recruit β-Trcp or Undergo Ubiquitination—Previous studies have clearly established that the Tyk2 Janus kinase plays an important role in sustaining the levels of IFNAR1 by counteracting its internalization and lysosomal degradation (17Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G. Richter M.F. Uze G. Ling L. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11839-11844Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Ragimbeau J. Dondi E. Alcover A. Eid P. Uze G. Pellegrini S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of stabilization of IF-NAR1 by Tyk2 remain to be determined. Constitutive association of Tyk2 with IFNAR1 is essential for IFN signaling; we have previously mapped the Tyk2-binding domain (amino acids 465–511) within the intracellular tail of IFNAR1 (22Yan H. Krishnan K. Lim J.T. Contillo L.G. Krolewski J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this region is adjacent to IFNAR1 ubiquitination sites determined here (Fig. 4). We sought to investigate whether the IFNAR1 stabilization effect of Tyk2 is mediated by inhibition of β-Trcp recruitment by IFNAR1, resulting in a decrease in β-Trcp-dependent ubiquitination of IFNAR1. Co-expression of HA-tagged Tyk2 and FLAG-tagged IFNAR1 constructs, followed by co-immunoprecipitation allowed us to detect Tyk2 binding to IFNAR1wt. An increase in the levels of IFNAR1 in cells co-expressed with Tyk2 was seen in some experiments (Fig. 5A, middle panel, lane 3 versus lane 2). This data are in line with results of Ragimbeau et al. (18Ragimbeau J. Dondi E. Alcover A. Eid P. Uze G. Pellegrini S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) who showed that such an increase reflects the ability of Tyk2 to inhibit internalization and degradation of IFNAR1. If binding of β-Trcp to IFNAR1 prevents its interaction with Tyk2 we would expect that the IFNAR1S535A mutant that is incapable of association with β-Trcp would exhibit more efficient binding to Tyk2. However, we found that the interaction between Tyk2 and the IFNAR1S535A mutant was comparable to the binding of this kinase to the wild-type receptor (Fig. 5A, upper panel, lane 3 versus lane 5). Furthermore, co-expression of Tyk2 led to an increase in the levels of this IFNAR1 mutant as well (Fig. 5A, middle panel, lane 4 versus lane 5). This result suggests that stabilization of IFNAR1 by Tyk2 is not likely to be mediated by interfering with recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligase by IFNAR1. Co-expression of Tyk2 also increased the levels of the IFNAR1K501R/K525R/K526R mutant protein (Fig. 5B, middle panel, lane 4 versus 5). Furthermore, this mutant interacted with Tyk2 with efficiency similar to IFNAR1wt (Fig. 5B, upper panel, lane 3 versus 5). Given that ubiquitination of IFNAR1K501R/K525R/K526R is substantially impaired (Fig. 4B), this finding indicates that the stabilizing effects of Tyk2 on IFNAR1 are independent of ubiquitination status of IFNAR1. Since IFNα promotes β-Trcp binding as well as ubiquitination and subsequent endocytosis of IFNAR1 (9Kumar K.G. Tang W. Ravindranath A.K. Clark W.A. Croze E. Fuchs S.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5480-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), we investigated whether treatment with the ligand may result in dissociation of Tyk2 from IFNAR1. Such dissociation could hypothetically expose an otherwise unavailable endocytosis motif within IFNAR1. Using FLAG-tagged-IFNAR1wt and IFNAR1S535A we tested the effect of IFNα on Tyk2 binding to the receptor. We observed that Tyk2 remained associated to both wild type and the mutant receptor even after 60 min of IFNα treatment, indicating that at least under this experimental setting, treatment of cells with the ligand does not affect the interaction between Tyk2 and IFNAR1 (Fig. 5C). This result further suggests that Tyk2 stabilizes IFNAR1 and elevates its levels by other mechanisms than counteracting the ligand-stimulated IFNAR1 ubiquitination. We next directly tested this possibility by assessing the effects of Tyk2 expression on ubiquitination of IFNAR1 in vivo. To estimate this effect, the levels of immunoprecipitated IFNAR1 were evaluated by a pilot immunoblot analysis with M2 antibody (data not shown) prior to loading the normalized volumes of material that contains comparable IFNAR1 amounts on a second gel (Fig. 5D). As evident from this figure, ubiquitination of IFNAR1 was not inhibited by expression of Tyk2. Collectively these data indicate that Tyk2 affects the stability and level of IFNAR1 either independently of β-Trcp-mediated ubiquitination of IFNAR1 or that it acts downstream of this ubiquitination. SCF E3 ligases consist of Skp1 tethering protein, the Cullin1-ROC1/Rbx1 complex that enables core ligase activity and an F box protein that acts as the substrate recognition subunit. Phosphorylation-dependent structural determinants that are present in a substrate confer recognition of this substrate by specific F-box proteins (10Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). In addition, availability of convenient Lys residues, which serve as acceptor sites for ubiquitin conjugation, often determines whether a recruited protein will be defined as a pseudosubstrate or will indeed undergo ubiquitination (15Tang W.

SCFβ-Trcp E3 ubiquitin ligase facilitates ubiquitination of phosphorylated substrates such as IκB and β-catenin, which undergo subsequent degradation via the 26 S proteasome (10Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 11Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Kumar K.G.

Identification of a membrane receptor as a substrate for β-Trcp adds to the structural complexity of substrate recognition and ubiquitination facilitated by these F box proteins. In the present study, we investigated the structural characteristics required for β-Trcp-dependent ubiquitination of the IFNAR1 subunit of the Type I IFN receptor that undergoes degradation via the lysosomal pathway (9Kumar K.G. Tang W. Ravindranath A.K. Clark W.A. Croze E. Fuchs S.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5480-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We found that, similar to IκB and β-catenin, the integrity of both Ser535 and Ser539 residues within the DSG(X)2+nS destruction motif located in the cytoplasmic tail of IFNAR1 is required for recruitment of β-Trcp. Interestingly, whereas the Ser residue within the DSG sequence is critically important for recruitment of β-Trcp, the requirement for the second Ser residue is less evident in some β-Trcp-interacting proteins including Vpu (26Coadou G. Gharbi-Benarous J. Megy S. Bertho G. Evrard-Todeschi N. Segeral E. Benarous R. Girault J.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14741-14751Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and Cdc25A (27Jin J. Shirogane T. Xu L. Nalepa G. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3062-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), although the composure of the destruction motif within Cdc25A requires further clarification (28Busino L. Donzelli M. Chiesa M. Guardavaccaro D. Ganoth D. Dorrello N.V. Hershko A. Pagano M. Draetta G.F. Nature. 2003; 426: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Similar to IκB and β-catenin, the recruitment of β-Trcp depends on both Ser535 and Ser539, which are essential for ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR1 (Fig. 2). However, unlike IκB and β-catenin, which are degraded by 26 S proteasome (10Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 11Fuchs S.Y. Spiegelman V.S. Kumar K.G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), ubiquitination of IFNAR1 leads to its endocytosis and lysosomal degradation (9Kumar K.G. Tang W. Ravindranath A.K. Clark W.A. Croze E. Fuchs S.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5480-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Extracellular signal-induced phosphorylation of serines within the destruction motif of IκBbyIκB kinases provides the hallmark signature recognized by β-Trcp (23Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4058) Google Scholar). Using phosphospecific antibody, we found that IFNAR1 is similarly phosphorylated within the DSGNYS motif. Our current data indicate that phosphorylation of IFNAR1 on Ser535 within the destruction motif is promoted by ligand treatment (Fig. 3). This finding suggests a mechanism for IFNα-induced down-regulation of its receptor. Such a mechanism requires activation of a yet to be identified kinase in response to IFNα treatment, phosphorylation of IFNAR1 within the destruction motif, recruitment of β-Trcp to phosphorylated IFNAR1, and ubiquitination of IFNAR1 followed by its endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. Future studies will be required to identify the nature of the IFNα-activated kinase that mediates phosphorylation of INFAR1 within the destruction Ser535, and to explore the mechanisms by which IFNα activates such a kinase. Ubiquitination of plasma membrane receptors on their intracellular domains leads to internalization of these proteins (4Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 5Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 7Hicke L. Dunn R.

Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of IFNAR1 contains seven Lys residues, however, mutation of only three is sufficient to dramatically inhibit ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR1 (Fig. 4, A and B). Recent structural studies indicate that SCF E3 ligases that complex with a phosphorylated substrate and recruit the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme exhibit a fairly rigid conformation. This suggests that ubiquitin-accepting lysine residues within a substrate should be optimally aligned toward E2 (29Orlicky S. Tang X. Willems A. Tyers M. Sicheri F. Cell. 2003; 112: 243-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 30Schulman B.A. Carrano A.C. Jeffrey P.D. Bowen Z. Kinnucan E.R. Finnin M.S. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W.

Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). This positioning model predicts an optimal spacing between a degradation motif and a lysine residue as a key characteristic of a bona fide SCF substrate. Indeed, IκB contains specific Lys (Lys21,22) residues in a position 9–10 amino acid residues proximal to the destruction motif (Fig. 1). Integrity of these Lys residues is essential for degradation of IκB (14Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11259-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been recently shown that efficient ubiquitination of a β-catenin-derived phosphopeptide by SCFβ-Trcp requires such specific spacing (13Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Our data showing that a mutation in similarly spaced Lys525 and Lys526 substantially decreased the extent of IFNAR1 ubiquitination (Fig. 4B) is consistent with the positioning model and its prediction of the preferred use of specific ubiquitin-acceptor sites by the SCFβ-Trcp E3 ligase. However, unlike IκB, despite noticeable decrease in ubiquitination of the IFNAR1K525R/K526R mutant, degradation of this mutant remains efficient. Mutation of another Lys residue, at position 501 along with K525R/K526R substitution, is required to yield a stabilized IFNAR1 protein (Fig. 4A). This difference between IκB and IFNAR1 could be attributed to different modes of degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. In IκB, efficient polyubiquitination is essential for its targeting to the 26 S proteasome, whereas a less efficient mono- or oligoubiquitination of plasma membrane receptors (including IFNAR1) is sufficient to provide an endocytic signal (4Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 5Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Thus, it is plausible that elimination of all ubiquitin acceptor sites, including those that are ubiquitinated less efficiently, is required for stabilization of IFNAR1. Nevertheless, considering that a single ubiquitin moiety is sufficient to trigger endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins (4Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 6Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 7Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), the selectivity of ubiquitin acceptor sites (three out of seven) within the intracellular domain of IFNAR1 that are essential for its degradation is intriguing. Since well characterized substrates of the SCFβ-Trcp, such as IκB and β-catenin, also exhibit preferential ubiquitination of a subset of Lys residues, these data further corroborate our previous results suggesting that IFNAR1 is a bona fide substrate of the SCFβ-Trcp E3 ligase. Future studies are needed to determine whether IFNAR1 undergoes mono- or polyubiquitination and the relative importance of these processes for regulation of the endocytosis and stability of IFNAR1. Tyk2, a member of the Janus tyrosine kinase family, is constitutively associated with the cytoplasmic domain of IFNAR1 and is important for Type I IFN signaling. Previous studies have demonstrated that, apart from exhibiting kinase activity that regulates IFNα signaling, Tyk2 plays a key role in sustaining the level of IFNAR1 (17Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G. Richter M.F. Uze G. Ling L. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11839-11844Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Tyk2 expression prevents internalization and lysosomal degradation of IFNAR1 thereby stabilizing it at the cell surface (18Ragimbeau J. Dondi E. Alcover A. Eid P. Uze G. Pellegrini S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We investigated potential cross-talk between Tyk2- and β-Trcp-dependent mechanisms in the regulation of IFNAR1 stability. As evident from Fig. 5, Tyk2 does not act upstream of β-Trcp-mediated ubiquitination of IFNAR1. Expression of Tyk2 did not interfere with ubiquitination of IFNAR1 (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, whereas β-Trcp-dependent ubiquitination relies on IFNα-inducible phosphorylation of IFNAR1 (Fig. 2 and Ref. 9Kumar K.G. Tang W. Ravindranath A.K. Clark W.A. Croze E. Fuchs S.Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5480-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), regulation of IFNAR1 levels by Tyk2 seems to be independent of the presence of ligand (18Ragimbeau J. Dondi E. Alcover A. Eid P. Uze G. Pellegrini S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Consistent with the latter data, we did not find any appreciable changes in the binding of Tyk2 to IFNAR1 upon treatment of cells with IFNα (Fig. 5C). It is plausible that Tyk2 stabilizes IFNAR1 in a β-Trcp-independent manner. However, the possibility that Tyk2 might act downstream of β-Trcp-mediated ubiquitination cannot be ruled out. Such a possibility would predict that Tyk2 binding to IFNAR1 facilitates recruitment of other factor(s), which might prevent endocytosis of the receptor by masking endocytosis motifs within IFNAR1 (including ubiquitinated lysines) and impeding recognition by the endocytic machinery. These hypothetical factors, in turn, could be released from the IFNAR1-Tyk2 complex in response to IFNα treatment, thereby allowing internalization and lysosomal degradation of IFNAR1. Further studies are required to address this scenario as well as to delineate how Tyk2 regulates the endocytosis and degradation of IFNAR1. We thank D. Bohmann and Z. Ronai for providing reagents and V. Spiegelman for comments on the manuscript."

One of the central components of innate immunity is the complement system. Activation of the complement pathways (i.e. classical, mannose binding lectin, or alternative pathways) can lead to opsonization and phagocytosis of invading pathogens, and in a majority of cases, complement mediates lysis and cell death (26Haviland D.L. Wetsel R.A. Creighton T.E. Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 525-532Google Scholar). Furthermore, complement component byproducts (e.g. C3a and C5a) can serve as potent chemoattractants for numerous inflammatory cells (27Prodinger W.M. Wurzner R. Erdei A. Dierich M.P. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. 4th Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1999: 967-995Google Scholar). A central component to all three pathways is the complement protein C3 (26Haviland D.L. Wetsel R.A.

C3 is not only critical for complement pathway activation, but it also plays a pivotal role in the interface between innate and acquired immune responses (28Lambris J.D. Immunol. Today. 1988; 9: 387-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Patients with a C3 deficiency have a significantly impaired complement system and have an increased susceptibility to infections from a variety of organisms (29Botto M. Walport M.J. Int. Rev.

To date most work describing the interactions between S. aureus and complement components has primarily focused on the role of the capsule as a means of preventing C3 deposition and C3-mediated opsonization of S. aureus (50Cunnion K.M. Zhang H.M. Frank M.M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 51Cunnion K.M. Lee J.C. Frank M.M. Infect.

However, many virulent S. aureus strains do not form a capsule (53Sopolinsky D. Samra Z. Karakawa W.W. Vann W.F. Schneerson R. Malik Z. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1985; 22: 828-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Na'was T. Hawwari A. Hendrix E. Hebden J. Edelman R. Martin M. Campbell W. Naso R. Fattom A.I. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1998; 36: 414-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that other complement-inhibitory strategies are likely. A recent report from our laboratory demonstrated that the S. aureus protein Efb binds to C3b and inhibits both complement-mediated lysis and opsonophagocytosis via a mechanism that inhibits C3b deposition onto activator surfaces (17Lee L.Y. Höök M. Haviland D. Wetsel R.A. Yonter E.O. Syribeys P. Vernachio J. Brown E.L. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 190: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Efb is a secreted, constitutively expressed protein that also binds fibrinogen. In addition, the efb gene was present in all S. aureus isolates examined but not identified in any other staphylococcal species (21Bodén Wastfelt M.K. Flock J.I. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 2347-2352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Investigations into the roles of Efb in vivo have resulted in various hypotheses describing functions for Efb and include roles for Efb in potentiating S. aureus survival by delaying wound healing and by inhibiting platelet aggregation via its interactions with fibrinogen and the platelet receptor GPIIb/IIIa (23Palma M.

Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these studies suggest that the fibrinogen binding domains were located at the N terminus of Efb and consist of two 22-amino acid repeats with homology to the fibrinogen binding domains of coagulase from S. aureus (20Bodén M.K. Flock J.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A third fibrinogen binding domain was also reported to reside in the C-terminal end of the protein; however, the fibrinogen binding activity of this site was less well defined since binding was dependent on whether fibrinogen was soluble or plate-bound (22Palma M. Wade D. Flock M. Flock J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13177-13181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 57Shannon O. Flock J.I. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 91: 779-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 58Wade D. Palma M. Lofving-Arvholm I. Sallberg M. Silberring J. Flock J.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Data presented in this report suggest that only the N-terminal half of Efb contains fibrinogen binding activity and that this domain is not involved in C3b binding. To define the C3b binding region(s), we engineered four recombinant forms of Efb that spanned the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively, and examined them in various binding assays for C3b and fibrinogen. Data presented in this report describe the C3 binding region in Efb to be located in the C terminus and that Efb binds specifically to the C3d fragment of C3 with high affinity. Furthermore, secondary structure analysis of recombinant Efb (rEfb) using circular dichroism spectroscopy suggested that the C3 binding region is primarily composed of α-helices and may represent a novel C3 binding motif. Cloning of and Expression of the Efb Truncations from S. aureus Strain Newman—The efb gene and efb truncations were amplified by PCR using S. aureus strain Newman DNA as a template. The following oligonucleotide primers were used for efb, efb104, efb120, and efb165, respectively (IDT Inc., Coralville, IA): 5′-CGC GGA TCC CCA AGA GAA AAG AAA CCA GTG AGT A-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AAC TGC AGA GTT TTA TTT AAC TAA TCC TTG-3′ (reverse primer); 5′-CCAGCAGCGAAAACTGATGCAA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AAGTTTTATTTAACTAATCCTTG-3′ (reverse primer); 5′-CGC GGA TCC CCA AGA GAA AAG AAA CCA GTG AGT A-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AAC TGC AGT TAT TCT CTC ACA AGA TTT TGA GCT TG-3′ (reverse primer); 5′-CCA GCA GCG AAA ACT GAT GCA ACT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AAC TGC AGA GTT TTA TTT AAC TAA TCC TTG-3′ (reverse primer). The resulting PCR products were subsequently cloned using the TA expression kit into the pCRT7/NT-TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen) and designated pCRT7/NT-rEfb, pCRT7/NT-rEfb104, pCRT7/NT-rEfb120, and pCRT7/NT-rEfb165. Nucleotide sequencing of efb, efb104, efb120, and efb165 was performed by automated sequencing (Molecular Genetics Core Facility, University of Texas-Houston Medical School). The recombinant proteins rEfb (17Lee L.Y. Höök M. Haviland D. Wetsel R.A. Yonter E.O. Syribeys P. Vernachio J. Brown E.L. J. Infect.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy, and proteins were stored at –20 °C until use. Western Blot Analysis—Recombinant proteins C3b, iC3b, C3c, or C3d (Advanced Research Technologies, San Diego, CA) (4 μg each) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and examined by staining with 0.05% Coomassie Brilliant Blue or electrotransferred onto a 0.45-μm Immobilon-P™ PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as described previously (17Lee L.Y. Höök M. Haviland D. Wetsel R.A. Yonter E.O. Syribeys P. Vernachio J. Brown E.L. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 190: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Membranes subjected to Western blot analysis were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 7.4) and probed accordingly and then developed with 10 ml of 1-Step™ nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate solution (Pierce). All incubations were performed in 15 ml of 1% TBST for 1 h with shaking at room temperature, and membranes were washed in TBST between all steps. Labeling with digoxigenin was performed as described previously according to the manufacturer's instructions (17Lee L.Y. Höök M. Haviland D. Wetsel R.A. Yonter E.O. Syribeys P. Vernachio J. Brown E.L. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 190: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). ELISA-type Binding Assays—Immulon-1B microtiter plate wells (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) were coated with either 0.25 μg of C3b or fibrinogen in 100 μl of PBS overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed and blocked with 200 μl of Super Block (Pierce) for 1 h. Recombinant proteins (0–500 nm in 100 μl final volume/well) were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. In the next step 100 μl of anti-His antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) (1:5000) were added and incubated for 1 h followed by 100 μl of goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated antibodies (1:5000). Alternatively, for digoxigenin-labeled proteins, 100 μl of AP-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies ((Fab fragment) Roche Diagnostics) (1:5000) were added. Next, 100 μlof a 1 mg/ml Sigma 104 phosphatase substrate (Sigma) dissolved in 1 m diethanolamine, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.8, was added, and the plates were allowed to develop for 1 h. Plates were read at 405 nm using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Plates were washed between all steps with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and all incubations took place at 37 °C. All dilutions were made using Super Block unless otherwise specified. Inhibition ELISA—Immulon-1B microtiter plate wells (Dynatech Laboratories) were coated with either 0.25 μg of C3b or C3d (Advanced Research Technologies) in 50 μl of PBS overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed and blocked with 200 μl of Super Block (Pierce) for 1 h. Increasing concentrations of either rEfb or the control protein decorin-binding protein A (DbpA) from B. burgdorferi (0–500 nm in 50 μl final volume/well) were added to C3b- or C3d-coated wells and incubated for 1 h followed by the addition of 50 μl of human Factor H (Advanced Research Technologies) (1 or 5 μg) and allowed to incubate for an additional hour. A 1:1000 dilution of goat-anti human Factor H was subsequently added (100 μl) and incubated for 1 h followed by 100 μlof rabbit anti-goat alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated antibodies (1: 5000). Plates were washed between all steps with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 unless otherwise indicated, and all incubations took place at 37 °C. All dilutions were made using Super Block unless otherwise specified. Complement Activity Assays—The EZ Complement CH50 clinical diagnostic assay kit (Diamedix, Miami, FL) was used to evaluate the effects of the rEfb truncations on classical complement pathway activation and used as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, human serum (5 μl of complement reference serum) was incubated in the presence of 5 μg of each recombinant protein at a final volume of 20 μl at 37 °C for 1 h before a 1-h incubation at room temperature with antibody-coated sheep red blood cells (RBCs) (3 ml). After incubating, the RBCs were centrifuged (1800 rpm for 10 min), and the absorbance of the supernatants (150 μl) was measured at 405 nm using a microplate reader as described above to determine the percent lysis of each sample. The data are expressed as percent lysis of the standard reference serum, and the values were derived using the equation, absorbance of sample/absorbance of reference serum × CH50 value of reference (Diamedix) (17Lee L.Y. Höök M. Haviland D. Wetsel R.A. Yonter E.O. Syribeys P. Vernachio J. Brown E.L. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 190: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism (CD)—rEfb, rEfb104, rEfb120, and rEfb165 were dialyzed twice in 2 liters of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and their respective concentrations were determined using UV spectroscopy. CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Inc., Easton, MD) calibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, using a round 0.2-mm quartz cell. The CD spectra were collected at a scan speed of 20 nm/min at 1-nm intervals with a 1-s response and a bandwidth of 1 nm. CD data were collected across a wavelength range of 180–260 nm and repeated through 20 iterations. The rEfb CD spectra were normalized by subtracting the CD spectra of buffer only, presented as units of mean residue ellipticity θMRW, and calculated by using the equation, θMRW = θ × 100 × MRW/c × d, where θ is the ellipticity in millidegrees, MRW is the mean residue weight of the recombinant protein, c is the concentration of the protein in mg/ml, and d is the cell path length in centimeters. Prediction of the secondary structure was obtained by combining data derived from three deconvolution programs (mean and S.E. were determined): self-consistent (Selcon) method, neural network (NN), and CONTIN (Sofsec version 1.2, Softwood Co., Brooksfield, CT) as described previously (61Sreerama N.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10250-10257Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Measurements—The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of 1.3 μm C3d in PBS was examined using a LS50B spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 25 °C. The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm (5-nm slit width) while monitoring emissions from 310–370 nm (4-nm slit width). Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence after the addition of rEfb (from 60 nm to 3.5 μm) was analyzed according to the modified plot of Stern-Volmer (63Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar) the F0/(F0 – F) ratio, where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities at 335 nm in the absence or presence of rEfb, respectively. The F0/(F0 – F) ratio determined for each concentration of rEfb was plotted against the reciprocal of the rEfb concentrations, which yielded a straight line wh"
https://openalex.org/W1967230265,"Neurons often possess elaborate axonal and dendritic arbors. Why do these arbors exist and what determines their form and dimensions? To answer these questions, I consider the wiring up of a large highly interconnected neuronal network, such as the cortical column. Implementation of such a network in the allotted volume requires all the salient features of neuronal morphology: the existence of branching dendrites and axons and the presence of dendritic spines. Therefore, the requirement of high interconnectivity is, in itself, sufficient to account for the existence of these features. Moreover, the actual lengths of axons and dendrites are close to the smallest possible length for a given interconnectivity, arguing that high interconnectivity is essential for cortical function."
https://openalex.org/W2065397704,"Circadian rhythms of physiology and behavior are generated by biological clocks that are synchronized to the cyclic environment by photic or nonphotic cues. The interactions and integration of various entrainment pathways to the clock are poorly understood. Here, we show that the Ras-like G protein Dexras1 is a critical modulator of the responsiveness of the master clock to photic and nonphotic inputs. Genetic deletion of Dexras1 reduces photic entrainment by eliminating a pertussis-sensitive circadian response to NMDA. Mechanistically, Dexras1 couples NMDA and light input to Gi/o and ERK activation. In addition, the mutation greatly potentiates nonphotic responses to neuropeptide Y and unmasks a nonphotic response to arousal. Thus, Dexras1 modulates the responses of the master clock to photic and nonphotic stimuli in opposite directions.

Here we found that FasL induces production of the inflammatory chemokine IL-8 without inducing apoptosis in HEK293 cells. Reporter gene assays involving wild-type and mutated IL-8 promoters and NF-κB- and AP-1 reporter constructs indicated that an FasL-induced NF-κB and AP-1 activity are required for maximal promoter activity. FasL induced NF-κB activation with slower kinetics than did TNF-α, yet this response was cell autonomous and not mediated by secondary paracrine factors. The death domain of Fas, FADD, and caspase-8 were required for NF-κB activation by FasL. A dominant-negative mutant of IKKγ inhibited the FasL-induced NF-κB activation. However, TRADD and RIP, which are essential for the TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation, were not involved in the FasL-induced NF-κB activation. Moreover, CLARP/FLIP inhibited the FasL- but not the TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. These results show that FasL induces NF-κB activation and IL-8 production by a novel mechanism, distinct from that of TNF-α. In addition, we found that mouse FADD had a dominant-negative effect on the FasL-induced NF-κB activation in HEK293 cells, which may indicate a species difference between human and mouse in the FasL-induced NF-κB activation.

A subset of this family called death receptors possesses a characteristic cytoplasmic region named death domain (DD) (1Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). Activation of these receptors induces recruitment of the death-inducing signaling complex, which consists of adaptor molecules (such as FADD and/or TRADD) and upstream caspases (such as caspase-8 and -10); this complex in turn initiates the activation cascade of caspases, which eventually results in apoptotic cell death. Like other members of the TNF receptor family, all the death receptors (TNF receptor type I (TNFR1), Fas, DR3, DR4, DR5, and DR6) have been reported to induce the activation of NF-κB (2Rensing-Ehl A.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), one of the most important transcription factors for the activation and regulation of the immune system. However, how these receptors activate NF-κB is still obscure. Fas (Apo1/CD95), a prototype of the death receptors, directly recruits FADD and strongly induces apoptosis in a variety of cell types upon its ligation by FasL (1Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). The Fas-FasL system plays pivotal roles in various aspects of immune regulation and function, such as self-tolerance, and cell-mediated cytotoxicity (9Suda T. Nagata S. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1997; 100: S97-S101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that FasL is expressed in “immune privileged” organs (such as the eye and testis) and protects them from destructive inflammation by counterattacking inflammatory cells (10Griffith T.S. Brunner T. Fletcher S.M. Green D.R. Ferguson T.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar, 11Bellgrau D. Gold D. Selawry H. Moore J. Franzusoff A. Duke R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). In contrast, ectopic expression of FasL by genetic engineering induces inflammation accompanied by massive neutrophil infiltration in animals (12Seino K. Kayagaki N. Okumura K. Yagita H. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 13Kang S.M. Schneider D.B. Lin Z. Hanahan D. Dichek D.A. Stock P.G. Baekkeskov S. Nat.

Furthermore, FasL seems to play detrimental roles in various inflammatory diseases such as hepatitis, graft-versus-host diseases, and pulmonary fibrosis (16Kondo T. Suda T. Fukuyama H. Adachi M. Nagata S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 17Miwa K. Hashimoto H. Yatomi T. Nakamura N. Nagata S. Suda T. Int.

Investig. 1999; 104: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). To clarify how FasL induces inflammation, we have been investigating the molecular mechanism of FasL-induced inflammation. We previously reported that FasL simultaneously induces apoptosis and the conversion of inactive pro-IL-1α into its active form; both of these processes are mediated by caspases (15Miwa K. Asano M. Horai R. Iwakura Y. Nagata S. Suda T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). This active IL-1α plays an important role in the FasL-induced inflammation. On the other hand, several reports have shown that some normal and transformed cell lines produce IL-8, a chemokine for neutrophils, upon Fas ligation by an anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (mAb) or FasL (19Abreu-Martin M.T.

Hepatol. 2001; 16: 1060-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB is correlated with the FasL-induced IL-8 production; however, there is no direct evidence that NF-κB activation is essential for this response. Furthermore, it has not been investigated whether FasL induces NF-κB activation directly or indirectly through the induction of another cytokine, such as IL-1. In this study, we have found that FasL induces cell-autonomous NF-κB activation and IL-8 production without inducing detectable apoptosis in HEK293 cells. Subsequent experiments using this cell line revealed that FasL induces NF-κB activation by a mechanism distinct from that of TNF-α.

The cDNAs for hIKKγ (IMAGE:2820134) was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). To generate cDNAs encoding FLAG-tagged proteins, full-length and truncated cDNAs were cloned into pCMV-Tag2 (Stratagene). The cDNAs encoding FLAG-tagged proteins were then subcloned into pEF-BOS to generate pEF-FLAG-hFADD (full-length), pEF-Flag-hFADD-DD (amino acids 80–208), pEF-Flag-hFADDΔC (amino acids 1–181), pEF-Flag-mFADD (full-length), pEF-Flag-p84-DD (amino acids 465–657), and pEF-Flag-IKKγ-DN (amino acids 135–419), respectively. To generate fusion molecules of hFADD and mFADD, recombinant PCR was performed as described previously (31Shudo K. Kinoshita K. Imamura R. Fan H. Hasumoto K. Tanaka M. Nagata S. Suda T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 2504-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) using the following fusion primers: for m/hFADD1 consisting of amino acids 1–80 from mFADD and amino acids 81–208 from hFADD, sense 5′-CTGCAGCGCCTGGACGACTTCGAG-3′ and antisense 5′-CTAGAAGTCGTCCAGGCGCTGCAG-3′; for m/hFADD2 consisting of amino acids 1–137 from mFADD and amino acids 138–208 from hFADD, sense 5′-GTCTGACAGAGCGTGTGC-3′ and antisense 5′-TCTGTCAGACTTCGGGGGT-3′. The PCR products were cloned into pCMV-Tag2 and then subcloned into pEF-BOS. The expression vector (pEF-TRADD-296S) carrying a dominant negative mutant of hTRADD (amino acids 196–312 with alanine substitution at amino acids 296–299) was constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis as described previously (34Park A. Baichwal V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9858-9862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The pcDNA3-HA-caspase8-mut (C377S), pcDNA3-Flag-CLARP(L), pcDNA3-Flag-CLARP(S), and pcDNA3-Myc-RIP-DD (amino acids 558–671) were kindly provided by Dr. N. Inohara (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI). The pCAGGS-Bcl-XL was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Tsujimoto (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). The CLARP-L and CLARP-S used in this study are identical with FLIP-L (GenBank™ accession number U97074) and FLIP-S (GenBank™ accession number U97075), respectively. To generate pNF-κB-GFP, the luciferase gene from pNF-κB-Luc was replaced with the GFP gene from pEGFP-1 (Clontech). Determination of the Cell Viability—Cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were cultured with recombinant mouse soluble FasL or TNF-α in flat-bottomed 96-well plates. Fifteen hours later, 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt and 1-methoxy-5-methylphenazinium methylsulfate (Dojin Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) were added to final concentrations of 5 and 0.2 mm, respectively, and further incubated for 4 h. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader. Measurement of IL-8 —The amount of IL-8 in culture supernatant was determined using an ELISA kit (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). RT-PCR Analysis—Single-strand cDNAs were prepared from 2 μgof total RNA using an oligo(dT) primer. Specific cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the following primers: IL-8 sense, 5′-CAGTTTTGCCAAGGAGTGCTAA-3′, antisense, 5′-AACTTCTCCACAACCCTCTGC-3′; FADD sense, 5′-CTGCAGCGCCTGGACGACTTCGAG-3′, antisense, 5′-AAAGCAGCGGCCCATCAGGA3′; α-actin sense, 5′-TGCGTGACATTAAGGAGAAG-3′, antisense, 5′-CGGATGTCCACGTCACACTT-3′. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—EMSA were carried out as described previously (35Masuda E.S. Tokumitsu H. Tsuboi A. Shlomai J. Hung P. Arai K. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7399-7407Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), except that the double-strand oligonucleotides containing the following NF-κB-binding sequence were used (sequence overhangs are lowercase): forward, 5′-gatcTGGGGACTTTCCGC-3′; reverse, 5′-gatcGCGGAAAGTCCCCA-3′. Competitive binding experiments were performed with a 50-fold excess of cold double-strand oligonucleotides with the wild-type or a mutated NF-κB-binding sequence (forward, 5′-gatcTGTTGACTTTTCGC-3′; reverse, 5′-gatcGCGAAAAGTCAACA-3′). Reporter Assays—HEK293 or 293T cells were transfected with one of the firefly luciferase reporter plasmids described above and pRL-TK using the TransIT-LT1 reagent (TAKARA, Otsu, Japan). Stable transfectants of HEK293 cells harboring the NF-κB-Luc construct and a hygromycin B resistance gene was also generated using the TransIT-LT1 reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Jurkat and Jurkat-derived cell lines were transfected with pNF-κB-Luc and pRL-TK using the LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). In some experiments, cells were cotransfected with one of the tester plasmids described above and/or an empty vector as a control. The total amount of transfected DNA per culture was kept constant within an experiment. Cells were harvested 24 h after the transfection, and then assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) in a LB9501 Lumat luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity. In some experiments, HEK293 cells were transfected with pNF-κB-GFP and the internal control plasmid pCMV-DsRed-Express (Clontech) using the LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent. Twenty-four hours after the transfection, cells were subjected to flow cytometry analyses using a FACSCalibur® (BD Biosciences) equipped with a 488-nm argon laser. The DsRed-positive cells were gated and their mean fluorescent intensity of GFP and DsRed was calculated using CELLQuest software. Relative NF-κB activity was assessed as follows; mean fluorescent intensity of GFP/mean fluorescent intensity of DsRed × 100. Western Blotting—Western blotting was carried out as previously described (36Suda T. Nagata S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) using the M2 mAb against FLAG peptide (Sigma), the 5F7 mAb against hcaspase-8 fragment (MBL, Nagoya, Japan), or a mAb against mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, Chemicon, Temecula CA). Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—The siRNA targeting hFADD (sense, 5′-GAUU GGAGAAGGCUGGCUCTT-3′; antisense, 5′-GAGCCAGCCUUCUCCAAUCTT-3′) and control siRNA (sense, 5′-CUCGGUCGGAAGAGGUUAGTT-3′; antisense, 5′-CUAACCUCUUCCGACCGAGTT-3′) were custom-synthesized (JBioS, Osaka, Japan). The siRNA targeting hcaspase-8 (sense, 5′-GGAACAACUGGACAGUGAAGAUCUGAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CAGAUCUUCACUGUCCAGUUGUUCCAU-3′) was custom-synthesized (iGENE, Tsukuba, Japan). HEK293 cells were transfected with double-stranded siRNA with or without various plasmids using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24 or 48 hours after the transfection, the cells were harvested and subjected to a flow cytometry, Western blotting, or RT-PCR analysis as described above. FasL Induces Delayed IL-8 Expression at the mRNA Level—We tested various human cell lines for their potential to produce IL-8 in response to FasL stimulation, and found that HEK293 cells exhibit this response without showing any evidence of apoptosis (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, U937 and HeLa cells produced IL-8 upon FasL stimulation only when apoptosis was inhibited by a pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (data not shown). A neutralizing mAb against FasL inhibited the FasL-induced but not the TNF-α-induced IL-8 production (Fig. 1A), confirming that FasL was responsible for this response. The artificial soluble mFasL (27Suda T. Tanaka M. Miwa K. Nagata S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3918-3924PubMed Google Scholar) used in these experiments has strong cytotoxic activity, resembling the membrane-bound form rather than the soluble form of FasL. To investigated which form of FasL is responsible for its IL-8-inducing activity, we transfected HEK293 cells with expression vectors carrying a FasL cDNA producing both membrane-bound and soluble forms (FasLDC), the membrane-bound form only (FasLDC2), or a soluble form only (FasLS) (31Shudo K. Kinoshita K. Imamura R. Fan H. Hasumoto K. Tanaka M. Nagata S. Suda T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 2504-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C, left panel). As expected, the cytotoxicity of FasL was detected in culture supernatant of the cells expressing FasLDC and FasLS but not FasLDC2, which is not released into the culture medium (Fig. 1C, right panel). Transfection of FasLDC and FasLDC2 but not FasLS induced IL-8 production, indicating that the membrane-bound form mediates the IL-8-inducing activity. TNF-α induced significant IL-8 production within 1.5 h, which lasted more than 12 h; in contrast, significant IL-8 production was detected starting 6 h after the FasL addition (Fig. 1D). Consistent with this, strong IL-8 mRNA expression was detected as early as 1.5 h after TNF-α stimulation, whereas weaker IL-8 mRNA expression was detected beginning 3 h after the FasL addition by RT-PCR analyses (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that FasL, compared with TNF-α, induces IL-8 expression more slowly at the mRNA level. NF-κB and AP-1 Binding Elements Are Required for the IL-8 Promoter Activation by FasL and NF-κB Activation Is Required for the FasL-induced IL-8 Production—The IL-8 promoter region contains three important cis-acting elements for IL-8 gene transcription, namely NF-κB, AP-1, and NF-IL-6 binding sites (29Ishikawa Y. Mukaida N. Kuno K. Rice N. Okamoto S. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4158-4164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and IL-8 transcription required either the combination of NF-κB and NF-IL-6 or that of NF-κB and AP-1 sites, depending on the type of cells or stimulation (37Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Mahe Y. Mukaida N. Kuno K. Akiyama M. Ikeda N. Matsushima K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13759-13763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Yasumoto K. Okamoto S. Mukaida N. Murakami S. Mai M. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22506-22511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contribution of these individual elements to the FasL-induced IL-8 promoter activity was examined using a luciferase reporter gene construct controlled under the minimal essential promoter region of the IL-8 gene (–133 to –44 bp) containing all three elements (40Okamoto S. Mukaida N. Yasumoto K. Rice N. Ishikawa Y. Horiguchi H. Murakami S. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8582-8589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a series of constructs with mutation in each of the elements (Fig. 2A). FasL induced strong luciferase activity in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the construct containing the wild-type IL-8 promoter. The mutation in the NF-κB-binding site completely abolished the FasL-induced luciferase activity. The mutation in the AP-1 binding site inhibited it strongly but not completely. In contrast, the mutation in the NF-IL-6 binding site had no effect on it. These results strongly suggest that the NF-κB site is essential, and the AP-1 site is partially required for the FasL-induced IL-8 promoter activation. Consistent with these results, FasL induced the expression of a luciferase gene controlled under the NF-κB or AP-1 elements in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). In agreement with the results shown in Fig. 1, addition of an anti-FasL mAb completely abolished the FasL-induced and NF-κB-driven expression of luciferase (Fig. 2B), and FasL induced slow NF-κB activation compared with TNF-α (data not shown). Furthermore, proteasome inhibitor lactacystin and expression of proteasome-resistant IκBα mutant (IκBα super-repressor) inhibited both NF-κB activation and IL-8 production induced by FasL or TNF-α (Fig. 2, D–G and data not shown). Considering the transfection efficiency in these experimental conditions (about 70%), the inhibition of IL-8 production by IκBα superrepressor is almost completely. These results indicate that NF-κB activation is essential for the FasL-induced IL-8 production. Induction of NF-κB Activity and IL-8 Promoter Activity by FasL Is a Cell-autonomous Response and Neither Transcriptional nor Translational Events Are Required—The delayed time course of FasL-induced IL-8 production and NF-κB activation raised the possibility that the effect of FasL might be indirect. To determine whether some secretory factor is involved in the FasL-induced NF-κB activation in a paracrine manner, we examined the potential of culture supernatant from FasL-treated HEK293 cells to activate transcription driven by NF-κB sites after the neutralization of FasL (Fig. 3A). We detected no induction of the NF-κB activity, indicating that there was no stable secondary mediator in the supernatant. TNF-α-treated supernatant induced NF-κB activity because of the carryover of TNF-α, serving as a positive control. However, these results do not rule out the possibility that the secondary mediator was unstable or a membrane-bound. To exclude this possibility, we mixed two HEK293 cell cultures that had been separately transfected with mFas cDNA and either the NF-κB reporter or IL-8 promoter reporter construct, and then cultured them with or without Jo2, the agonistic mAb specific for mFas (Fig. 3B). Jo2 did not induce luciferase activity when the reporter constructs were transfected alone, because Jo2 cannot activate the endogenous hFas of HEK293 cells (lane 2). However, the cotransfection of mFas and reporter constructs induced luciferase activity (lanes 5 and 7) and Jo2 enhanced it (lanes 6 and 8). In contrast, significant luciferase activity was not detected when mFas cDNA and a reporter construct were separately transfected, even after Jo2 stimulation (lanes 9 and 10). Consistent with reporter assays shown in Fig. 2B, FasL as well as TNF-α induced NF-κB-specific DNA binding activity in the nuclear extract of HEK293 cells, as revealed by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 3C). Importantly, pretreatment with actinomycin D or cycloheximide had no effect on NF-κB DNA binding activity induced either FasL or TNF-α. Therefore, neither transcriptional nor translational events are required for FasL- and TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. These results indicate that no secondary mediator is essential for the FasL-induced NF-κB activation. Consistent with a previous report (25Manos E.J. Jones D.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 433-438PubMed Google Scholar), addition of anti-p65 and -p50 antibodies resulted in the supershift of the nuclear NF-κB induced by either FasL or TNF-α (data not shown), suggesting that FasL and TNF-α induce a similar NF-κB complex. The DD of Fas and FADD Play a Critical Role for the FasL-induced NF-κB Activation—To clarify which cytoplasmic region of the Fas receptor was responsible for the FasL-induced NF-κB activation, we expressed a set of mutants of hFas in HEK293 cells. Comparable expression of the wild-type and mutant Fas on the cell surface of transfectants was confirmed by FACS analysis (see Supplemental Fig. S1). Consistent with previous reports, overexpression of hFas activated NF-κB (Fig. 4A). Deletion of the C-terminal 15 amino acids from hFas up-regulates its ability to induce apoptosis (32Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this deletion did not affect its capacity to induce NF-κB activation. On the other hand, the further deletion of Fas up to a part of the DD (FD7 and FD2) or the lprcg-type point mutation (Val238 to Asn) in the DD (FP1), which abolishes its apoptosis-inducing capacity (32Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also abrogated its ability to activate NF-κB. These results indicate that the C-terminal 15 amino acids of hFas are dispensable, but the DD of Fas is indispensable for its ability to activate NF-κB. We next addressed the role of FADD, which is essential to recruit caspase-8 and to induce apoptosis upon Fas ligation (28Kawahara A. Ohsawa Y. Matsumura H. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1353-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 41Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), in the FasL-induced NF-κB activation. As shown in Fig .4B, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of FADD (FADD-DD) efficiently blocked the FasL- but not TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. Because overexpression of FADD-DD might interfere with Fas to recruit signaling molecules other than FADD, we sought to suppress FADD expression specifically using siRNA. The effect of siRNA to endogenous FADD was validated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4C). FADD-targeting siRNA but not a control siRNA with the reverse sequence of the FADD-targeting siRNA reduced the expression of FADD gene. In addition, the specificity of our FADD-targeting siRNA was confirmed by its ability to diminish the"

We and others have previously reported that cytokine- and growth factor-mediated signal transduction is involved in the growth and progression of MM. Here, we identified a pathway that involves stem cell factor (SCF)/c-Kit/Slug in mediating multidrug resistance of MM cells. When we compared gene expression profiles between five MM cells and their multidrug-resistant (MM DX) sublines, we found that MM DX cells expressed both SCF and c-Kit and had higher mRNA levels of Slug. Knockdown of c-Kit or Slug expression with their respective small interfering RNA sensitized MM DX cells to the induction of apoptosis by different chemotherapeutic agents, including doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and vincristine. Transfection of c-Kit in parental MM cells in the presence of SCF up-regulated Slug and increased resistance to the chemotherapeutic agents. Moreover, MM cells expressing Slug showed a similar increased resistance to the chemotherapeutic agents. These results indicate that induction of Slug by autocrine production of SCF and c-Kit activation plays a key role in conferring a broad spectrum chemoresistance on MM cells and reveal a novel signal transduction pathway for pharmacological or genetic intervention of MM patients.

MM is characterized by overexpression of several cytokines, growth factors, and tyrosine kinase receptors (1Carbone M. Kratzke R.A. Testa J.R. Semin. Oncol. 2002; 29: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Some of these are proto-oncogenes and key regulators for proliferation, differentiation, and motility of MM cells (2Catalano A. Gianni W. Procopio A. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hemat. 2004; 50: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Whether cytokines and growth factors may control other mechanisms of MM progression remains to be determined.MM is poorly responsive to chemotherapy, and median patient survival is 8–18 months (3Nowak A.K. Lake R.A. Kindler H.L. Robinson B.W. Semin. Oncol. 2002; 29: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). MM cells exhibit resistance in vitro and in vivo to many anti-cancer agents, including doxorubicin and cisplatin, which are nevertheless widely used to treat MM (4Tomek S. Emri S. Krejcy K. Manegold C. Br. J. Cancer. 2003; 88: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In most cases, this is the consequence of overexpression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including MDR1 (ABCB1), MRP1 (ABCC1), and MRP2 (5Baldini N. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 378-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, ABC transporters cannot completely explain the widespread MDR phenotype of MM cells (6Ogretmen B. Bahadori H.R.

Oncol. 2001; 12: 1239-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting that other factors may be involved.The tyrosine kinase receptor c-Kit and its ligand stem cell factor SCF are essential to the maturation of hemopoietic and primordial germ cell precursors and melanocytes during embryonic development (8Witte O.N.

A. 1993; 90: 3760-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, aberrant expression of c-Kit and/or SCF has been reported in several tumors, such as acute myeloid leukemia (10Furitsu T. Tsujimura T. Tono T. Ikeda H. Kitayama H. Koshimizu U.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3049-3053PubMed Google Scholar), and breast carcinomas (14Hines S.J. Organ C. Kornstein M.J. Krystal G.W. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 769-779PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, constitutive activation of c-Kit is also involved in tumor progression.Multiple cellular functions are affected by c-Kit-dependent signals including cell survival, proliferation, adhesion, and differentiation (15Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Leuk. Res. 1998; 22: 1097-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). SCF augments the derivation of melanocytes from embryonic stem cells (16Yamane T. Hayashi S. Mizoguchi M. Yamazaki H. Kunisada T. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 216: 450-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Kit activation was found to suppress apoptosis of normal murine melanocyte precursors (17Hachiya A. Kobayashi A. Ohuchi A. Takema Y. Imokawa G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 578-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), soft tissue sarcomas of neuroectodermal origin (18Ricotti E. Fagioli F. Garelli E. Linari C.

Blood. 1998; 91: 2397-2405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and normal and malignant human hemopoietic cells (19Zeuner A. Pedini F. Signore M. Testa U. Pelosi E. Peschle C. De Maria R. Blood. 2003; 102: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This antiapoptotic activity of SCF/c-Kit signals is mediated, at least in part, by the zinc finger transcription factor Slug (20Perez-Losada J. Sanchez-Martin M. Perez-Caro M. Perez-Mancera P.A. Sanchez-Garcia I. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4205-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which functions as transcriptional repressor (21Hemavathy K. Ashraf S.I. Ip Y.T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, we can find very little or no documentation regarding the expression of SCF/c-Kit system or Slug in human MM tissue.In this study, we set out to gain insights into the control of MDR in MM cells. We determined whether cytokines, growth factors, or their receptors can activate and consequently protect MM cells against chemotherapeutic injury, and, if so, we dissected the molecular mechanisms underlying this cytoprotection. We identified the SCF/c-Kit signaling pathway as a component of the MDR program induced by chemotherapy and provide evidence that this signal acts in the MDR phenotype, in part, by modulating the activity of Slug.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—All of the primary antibodies used, excluding anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (by Sigma) and monoclonal anti-MDR1 antibody (Calbiochem), were obtained from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). The antineoplastic agents doxorubicin (adriamycin), paclitaxel (taxol), and vincristine as well as verapamil were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant human SCF was obtained from Sigma. The pBabePuro plasmid was a gift from Dr. G. J. Clark (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified.Cell Lines—We used a panel of five human MM cell lines (22Catalano A. Graciotti L. Rinaldi L. Raffaelli G. Rodilossi S. Betta P. Gianni W. Amoroso S. Procopio A. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 109: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Catalano A. Romano M. Martinotti S. Procopio A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). MM1, MM3, MM4, and MM5 cells were derived from previously untreated patients and identified morphologically and by extensive phenotypic analysis as previously described (24Orengo A.M. Spoletini L. Procopio A. Favoni R.E. De Cupis A. Ardizzoni A. Castagneto B. Ribotta M. Betta P.G. Ferrini S. Mutti L. Eur. Respir. J. 1999; 13: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). They were then expanded and utilized for the experiments. H-Meso cell lines (MM2) have been characterized previously (25Reale F.R. Griffin T.W. Compton J.M. Graham S. Townes P.L. Bogden A. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3199-3205PubMed Google Scholar). MM DX cells were selected from their parental cells by stepwise increases in doxorubicin concentrations from 0.0001 to 0.3 μm, as detailed elsewhere (26Monti F. Lalli E. Contadini A. Szymczuk S. Pini E. Tononi A. Fattori P.P. Facchini A. Ravaioli A. J. Chemother. 1994; 6: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). MM DX cells were then maintained in the presence of 2.5 μm doxorubicin. All cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (complete medium) (all from HyClone, Rome, Italy) at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Proliferation Assays—Chemotherapy sensitivity was assessed by MTT assay as previously described (22Catalano A. Graciotti L. Rinaldi L. Raffaelli G. Rodilossi S. Betta P. Gianni W. Amoroso S. Procopio A. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 109: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cells were pulse-exposed to different concentrations of doxorubicin, vincristine, or paclitaxel for 24 h. The cells were then cultured for an additional 36 h in culture medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. After this time, the remaining cells were stained with MTT (Promega, Madison, WI) using the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbances were normalized, and LC90 values were calculated by nonlinear regression. Normalized data and nonlinear regression curves were plotted graphically as a percentage of viable cells. Alternatively, cells were incubated with chemotherapeutic drugs for 24 h. Cells were then collected after different times, stained with trypan blue, and counted.Apoptosis—Cells (5 × 105) were plated 24 h before treatment. Cells were then exposed to the indicated chemotherapeutic agents for 24 h. At the end of treatment, cells were washed twice with phosphate buffer with calcium and magnesium (PBS), and apoptosis was determined using the cell death detection ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instruction.Reverse Transcription and Real Time PCR—For real time PCR, total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) and reverse-transcribed, and the cDNA was quantified using the TaqMan system (Applied Biosystems, Milan, Italy). Values for each mRNA were normalized to the relative quantity of GAPDH mRNA in each sample. The PCRs were carried out in a Chromo4 sequence detector (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). The primer and probe sets used for the amplification of the investigated genes were supplied by Applied Biosystems. Details of sequences and thermal cycle conditions are available upon request.To analyze the expression of Slug and Snail in cell lines, reverse transcription (RT) was performed as previously described (20Perez-Losada J. Sanchez-Martin M. Perez-Caro M. Perez-Mancera P.A. Sanchez-Garcia I. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4205-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thermocycling parameters for PCR and the sequences of the specific primers were as follows: Slug, 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, sense primer 5′-GCCTCCAAAAAGCCAAACTA-3′, antisense primer 5′-CACAGTGATGGGGCTGTATG-3′; Snail, 30 cycles at 95 °C for 2 min, 60 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, sense primer 5′-CAGCTGGCCAGGCTCTCGGT-3′, antisense primer 5′-GCGAGGGCCTCCGGAGCA-3′. Amplification of β-actin RNA served as a control to assess the quality of each RNA sample.Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and ELISA—Proteins (50–75 μg/lane) were separated on 7.5–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Transfers were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat milk in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the primary antibody diluted (1:1000) in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20. The transfers were rinsed with TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:5000 in 5% nonfat milk in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20. The immunoblots were developed with the Super Signal reagent (Pierce). Protein concentration was determined by standard Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). All Western blots were reprobed with human β-actin antibody (sc-1616; 1:1000) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) to confirm equivalent loading of protein samples. Human SCF levels in cell lysates and culture supernatants were determined using an ELISA kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions.For analysis of c-Kit receptor autophosphorylation, cells were rapidly lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 1 m NaF, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium vanadate) on ice for 20 min. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 × g, and protein content was quantitated as described above. One mg of total protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Kit antibody and detected by Western blotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis—Cells (1 × 105) were washed three times in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (PBS buffer) and then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with appropriate amounts of anti-c-Kit monoclonal antibody (R&D Systems). Cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (Fab)2 goat anti-mouse IgG. After three washes, samples were analyzed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences). A minimum of 10,000 events/sample was analyzed. As a negative control, an isotypematched monoclonal antibody with irrelevant specificity was used.Plasmids—The full-length c-Kit cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3 plasmid vector and transfected into MM5 cells by LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfected cells were selected in 400 μg/ml Geneticin and further subcloned as previously described (27Catalano A. Romano M. Robuffo I. Strizzi L. Procopio A. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The expression of c-Kit protein in the single-cell clones (G5 and G12) was characterized by Western blotting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis.Full-length cDNA for human Slug (GenBank™ accession number BC014890) and Snail (GenBank™ accession number NM005985) were amplified from RNA of MM cell lines by reverse transcription-PCR, and a COOH-terminal FLAG epitope tag was added by PCR as previously described (28Hajra K.M. Chen D.Y. Fearon E.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1613-1618PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs were subcloned into the pBabePuro plasmid. The identities of all plasmid inserts and vector boundary regions were confirmed by sequence analysis. Details of the construct are available upon request. Transient transfection with Slug and Snail constructs and culturing of transduced cells were performed by standard procedures.Generation of c-Kit siRNA and Slug d-siRNA for Transfection—c-Kit siRNA was synthesized to target the c-Kit sequence (5′-AAGGCCGACAAAAGGAGATCT-3′). The sense and antisense c-Kit siRNAs were 5′-GGCCGACAAAAGGAGAUCUdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGAUCUCCUUUUGUCGGCCdTdT-3′ (antisense) (Qiagen, Milan, Italy). A nonspecific control siRNA (CsiRNA) was also synthesized (5′-GCGCGCUUUGUAGGAUUCGdTdT-3′ and 3′-dTdTCGCGCGAAACAUCCUAAGC-5′) (Qiagen, Milan, Italy).To generate Slug d-siRNA, full-length cDNA of human Slug with T7 promoters at both ends were made by PCR and subjected to in vitro transcription to produce large double-stranded RNA as previously described (29Myers J.W. Jones J.T. Meyer T. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Then Slug d-siRNA was produced using an r-Dicer kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For transfection, cells (105 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates, grown in antibiotic-free medium overnight, and then transfected with specific siRNA using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 24 or 48 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized, replated, and incubated overnight before treatment.Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy). Electrophoretic separation and membrane transfer of RNA were carried out by standard methods. For use as probes, Slug, Snail, and GAPDH cDNA fragments were labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) by random priming with the RediPrime II kit (Amersham Biosciences). Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out in Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences), the membrane was washed, and the blot was exposed to BioMax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.).Statistical Analysis—All values were expressed as mean ± S.D. Comparison of results between different groups was performed by one-way analysis of variance and paired t test using StatView 5.0 (NET Engineering, Pavia, Italy).RESULTSCharacterization of the Multidrug-resistant Malignant Mesothelioma Cells (MM DX Cells)—Five MM DX sublines were selected from their parental MM cell lines by exposure to stepwise increases in doxorubicin concentrations. Their drug sensitivity profile to doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and vincristine are shown in Table I. The concentration of drug lethal for 90% of treated cells (LC90) was calculated from dose-response curves for each drug tested using the MTT assay. MM DX cells with an LC90 value ≥3-fold greater than that of parental cells were considered resistant.Table ILC90 values of parental MM cell lines and MM DX sublinesCell linesLC90 valuesaThe cells were pulse-exposed to increasing concentrations of doxorubicin (from 0 to 2.5 μm), paclitaxel (from 0 to 0.5 μm), and vincristine (from 0 to 0.5 μm) for 24 h. The cells were then cultured for an additional 36 h in culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

Open table in a new tab All of the five MM DX sublines expressed an elevated amount of MDR1 protein (also known as P-glycoprotein) (Fig. 1A). To investigate to what extent P-glycoprotein expression determines MDR phenotype, we treated MM DX sublines with verapamil, a substance that antagonizes P-glycoprotein activity through competitive block of calcium channels. Contemporary application of doxorubicin and 5 μm verapamil, a concentration known not to have a cytotoxic effect, did not significantly modify the LC90 value of MM1 DX or MM2 DX sublines as determined by trypan blue exclusion (Fig. 1, B and C) and MTT assay (data not shown). These results indicated that MM DX cells acquired an MDR phenotype, which was independent by MDR1 expression.Cytokines, Growth Factors, and Their Receptor Expression in MM DX and MM Cells—Differential cytokine and growth factor mRNA expression between MM DX and MM cells were determined by real time PCR analysis. Four of five MM DX sublines showed a 2–4-fold increase in the expression of SCF (Fig. 2A). By contrast, MM DX and parental cells expressed equal amounts of VEGF, TGF-β, insulin-like growth factor-1, PDGF, and FGF-2 (Fig. 2A) as well as TGF-α and hepatocyte growth factor (data not shown). Expression of SCF protein was confirmed by Western blotting analysis. Membrane-bound SCF showed a marked increase in the MDR sublines compared with the parental cells, whereas soluble SCF was not detectable in all cell types (Fig. 2B, inset). Accordingly, increased amounts of SCF were detected by ELISA in the cell lysates (Fig. 2B), but not in conditioned media (data not shown), of four of five MM DX sublines.Fig. 2Expression of cytokines and growth factors in MM DX and MM cells. A, total RNA (200 ng/μl) was isolated from MM DX sublines and parental cells and used for real-time PCR analyses for SCF, VEGF, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), TGF-β, PDGF, and FGF-2 transcripts. The mRNA levels of house-keeping gene GAPDH were used as internal control (not shown). B, cell lysates obtained from MM DX and parental cells were solubilized in Nonidet P-40/SDS buffer. 50 μg of protein of each extract were electrophoresed and analyzed by Western blotting for SCF and actin proteins (inset). Cell lysates of MM DX sublines and MM cells were collected at 48 h and assayed for SCF using the ELISA kit. *, p ≤ 0.05 MM DX sublines versus the relative parental MM cells, paired t test, n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The expression of tyrosine kinase receptors in both MM DX and MM cells was then evaluated by real time PCR, and most of the MDR sublines expressed higher mRNA levels of the SCF receptor c-Kit than parental cells (Fig. 3A). VEGF receptor-1 (Flt-1) and PDGF receptor-α mRNA increased in three of five MM DX cells, whereas VEGF receptor-2 (KDR), FGF receptor-1 and PDGF receptor-β decreased in four of five MDR sublines compared with parental cells (Fig. 3A). In addition, MM DX cells did not modify mRNA levels of EGF receptor (c-erbB2) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET) compared with parental cells (data not shown). Consistently, c-Kit protein expression was higher in four of five MM DX sublines with respect to parental cells with the exception of MM3 DX cells (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Expression of tyrosine kinase receptors in both MM DX and MM cells. A, total RNA (200 ng/μl) was isolated from MM DX and MM cells and then analyzed for c-Kit, Flt-1, VEGF receptor-2 (KDR), FGF receptor-1, and PDGF receptor-α and -β expression by real time PCR. Values for each mRNA were normalized to the relative quantity of GAPDH mRNA in each sample. B, cell surface expression of c-Kit was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis in all MM cell types. Results are representative of three similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Down-regulation of c-Kit Expression or Function by Small Interfering RNA and Neutralizing Anti-c-Kit Antibody Restore Sensitivity to Anticancer Agents in MM DX Sublines—The co-expression of SCF and its receptor c-Kit in some of the MM DX cells suggested that this pathway could confer MDR to anticancer compounds by an autocrine/paracrine mechanism. To address this hypothesis, we knocked down c-Kit with small interfering RNA (c-Kit siRNA) duplexes. Exposure of MM1 DX or MM2 DX cells to c-Kit siRNA was associated with down-regulation of c-Kit expression (Fig. 4A). There was no detectable down-regulation of c-Kit in MM1 DX or MM2 DX sublines exposed to a control siRNA (CsiRNA) (Fig. 4A). Neither c-Kit siRNA nor CsiRNA inhibited MDR1 protein expression in MM1 DX (Fig. 4B) as well as in MM2 DX sublines (data not shown), suggesting no functional association between MDR1 and SCF/c-Kit signals.Fig. 4Transient down-regulation of c-Kit expression sensitizes MM DX cells to drug-induced apoptosis. A, MM1 DX and MM2 DX cells were treated with CsiRNA or c-Kit siRNA and harvested 48 h after transfection. Lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Kit and anti-actin antibodies. B, moreover, cell lysates (50 μg of proteins) of treated MM1 DX cells were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-MDR1 antibody C219 or anti-actin antibody. As control, detection of MDR1 in cell lysates of parental MM1 cells was also performed. C, MM1 DX, MM2 DX, MM1, and MM2 cells were treated with CsiRNA or c-Kit siRNA. After 24 h, cells were pulse-exposed for an additional 24 h to the indicated concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents (1.5 μm doxorubicin, 0.3 μm paclitaxel, or 0.3 μm vincristine) followed by an additional 16-h drug-free culture period. Apoptosis was then determined by a cell death detection ELISA kit. *, p ≤ 0.01 versus CsiRNA, ANOVA, n = 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)MM1 DX or MM2 DX sublines and their parental cells exposed to CsiRNA or c-Kit siRNA were then analyzed for nucleosome formation, a marker of apoptosis (30Yu J. Zhang L. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2004; 16: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MM1 DX, MM2 DX, or parental cells exposed to c-Kit siRNA exhibited no significant increase in nucleosome formation compared with controls (Fig. 4C). By contrast, MM1 DX and MM2 DX cells exposed to c-Kit siRNA responded to doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or vincristine with an increase in apoptosis compared with that obtained with cells exposed to CsiRNA (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained by adding neutralizing anti-c-Kit antibody (5 μg/ml), whereas an antibody with irrelevant specificity had no effect (data not shown). These findings indicate that blocking the autocrine activity of SCF or knocking down c-Kit expression increased sensitivity to genotoxic agents in the MDR sublines.Activation of the c-Kit-dependent Pathway by SCF Confers MDR in MM Cells—To further determine the role of SCF/c-Kit signaling in mediating the resistance of MM cells, MM5 cells lacking endogenous c-Kit (see Fig. 3) were engineered to stably express a wild-type, full-length c-Kit receptor. We used representative clones G5 and G12 in our studies, which had high c-Kit protein levels as well as MM5 DX sublines (Fig. 5A). G12 or G5 cells were treated with SCF (100 ng/ml) for 10 min, and autophosphorylation of c-Kit was examined by immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Kit antibody followed by Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. In the presence of SCF, autophosphorylation of c-Kit was detected in G12 cells, indicating c-Kit activation (Fig. 5B). Notably, MM5 DX cells also showed c-Kit autophosphorylation in the absence of SCF (Fig. 5B), sugg"

GATA4, a cardiac-enriched dual zinc finger transcription factor, plays a critical role in regulating cardiac-specified genes. Here, we demonstrated that GATA4 is sumoylated by small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO-1), which resulted in enhanced GATA4 transcriptional activity. We further revealed that lysine 366 of GATA4 constituted a major sumyolation site. Conversion of lysine 366 to arginine 366 resulted in reduced GATA4 nuclear occupation, suggesting that SUMO modification may also modulate GATA4 nuclear localization. In GATA4 sumoylation, PIAS1 served as an E3 ligase and positively modulated GATA4 transactivation via its RING finger domain. In the presence of SUMO-1 and/or PIAS1, GATA4 triggered the activation of cardiogenic genes in pluripotent 10T1/2 fibroblast. GATA4 was identified as a SUMO-1-targeted transcription factor and together with PIAS1 was shown to be a potent regulator of cardiac gene activity.

There is a growing belief that posttranslational modifications by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) 1The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; PIAS, protein inhibitor of activated STAT; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase. act as important regulators of transcription factor activity (1Pichler A. Melchior F. Traffic. 2002; 3: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). SUMO modification is accomplished by the reversible attachment of SUMO family members to the acceptor lysine residue(s) located in the target proteins, with the help of activating enzyme SAE1/2 and conjugating enzyme Ubc9. The process of sumoylation is similar to ubiquitination, but instead of directing the target protein toward proteolysis, it alters the functional activity of targets by regulating protein-protein interactions (2Matunis M.J.

In general, the most frequent lysine residue for sumoylation is localized in the SUMO-recognizable canonical sequence ΨKXE (12Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol.

SAE1/2 and Ubc9 were found to be sufficient to direct the SUMO ligation of some targets, whereas SUMO E3 ligase may also stimulate sumoylation efficiency and direct substrate specificity for SUMO modification (1Pichler A.

There are three different classes of SUMO E3 ligase represented by the PIAS (protein inhibitors of activated STAT) family (25Jackson P.K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the nucleoporin RanBP2 (26Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F.

Among these, only PIAS proteins are found to facilitate sumoylation via the RING finger domain, which is similar to the one contained in the E3 ligase involved in ubiquitination. The PIAS superfamily is composed of five members, PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASxa, PIASxb, and PIASy, all of which have been proven to possess E3 ligase activity linked to their conserved RING finger domains (28Kotaja N.

GATA4 is a transcription factor belonging to the GATA superfamily composed of six members with GATA1, -2, and -3 largely restricted to hematopoietic lineage and GATA4, -5, and -6 abundant in heart. This family of transcription factors is characterized by the existence of two centrally located zinc finger domains that recognize the consensus motif (A/T)GATA(A/G) found in the regulatory region of target genes such as α-myosin heavy chain (33Molkentin J.D. Kalvakolanu D.V. Markham B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ANF (34Nemer G. Nemer M. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Gene targeting and null mutation studies have revealed that GATA4 plays a critical role in the regulation of embryogenesis as well as heart development. Mice with deletion of the GATA4 locus exhibit embryonic lethality at E9.5 with a defect in fusion of two primordial tubes (35Narita N. Bielinska M. Wilson D.B. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), whereas selective overexpression of GATA4 in the heart results in cardiac hypertrophy (36Liang Q. De Windt L.J. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30245-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Recent studies also show that GATA4 serves as a survival factor for cardiomyocytes, which protects the heart from doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (37Aries A. Paradis P. Lefebvre C. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6975-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The transcriptional function of GATA4 is modulated via protein-protein interaction and/or posttranslational modifications. For instance, interaction of GATA4 with another GATA family member, GATA6, cooperatively activates ANF and BNP promoters (38Charron F. Paradis P. Bronchain O. Nemer G. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4355-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation on Ser-105 in GATA4 by mitogen-activated protein kinase enhances its function of promoting cardiomyocyte differentiation as well as cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (39Liang Q. Wiese R.J. Bueno O.F. Dai Y.S. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7460-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 40Charron F. Tsimiklis G. Arcand M. Robitaille L. Liang Q. Molkentin J.D. Meloche S. Nemer M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2702-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), suggesting that the posttranslational modification on GATA4 is critical for its functional performance in the cellular physiological as well as pathological processes. GATA2 was shown to be a substrate for SUMO1/2, and PIASy suppressed GATA2 activation capacity without significantly affecting its DNA binding ability (41Chun T.H. Itoh H. Subramanian L. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Nakao K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). More recently, GATA1 was also shown to be a SUMO-1 target and PIASy again specifically repressed the activation of GATA-dependent promoters (21Collavin L. Gostissa M. Avolio F. Secco P. Ronchi A. Santoro C. Del Sal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8870-8875Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These studies support the idea that SUMO modification may be implicated in modulating functional activity of other GATA family members. We initiated this study to determine whether SUMO modification would alter GATA4 functional activity. We found that GATA4 is indeed modified by SUMO-1 both in vivo and in vitro, with E3 ligase PIAS1 strongly enhancing the sumoylation efficiency. In striking contrast to studies of GATA1 and GATA2, SUMO modification resulted in enhanced GATA4 transcriptional activation and strongly induced the transcriptional activity of endogenous cardiac-specific genes in pluripotent 10T1/2 fibroblast cells. Given that GATA4 plays a pivotal role in heart development, this study has provided novel insight into the potential role of the SUMO family in facilitating cardiac gene activity. Expression Vectors, Reporter Genes, and siRNA—An atrial natriuretic factor gene promoter luciferase reporter construct (ANF-Luc) was kindly provided by Dr. Mona Nemer. GST·Ubc9 and GST·SUMO-GG were gifts from Dr. Jorma J. Palvimo, and GST·SAE1/2 was a gift from Dr. Ron T. Hay. Myc-tagged full-length mouse GATA4 was described (42Chang D.F. Belaguli N.S. Iyer D.

Mammalian expression plasmids for FLAG-SUMO-1 and HA-PIAS1 and its Ring domain mutant were described (24Liang M. Melchior F. Feng X.H. Lin X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22857-22865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The GATA4 point mutant was generated by PCR using an oligonucleotide primer with a mutated site from lysine to arginine, on lysine 366. The PCR-generated DNA product was inserted into a pCDNA3.1-GATA4 expression vector by using restriction enzymes NotI and XbaI. The mutation was verified by sequencing. The sequence of this primer for point-targeted mutagenesis is available upon request. Ubc9 siRNA was detailed previously (3Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Brunicardi F.C. Feng X.H. J. Biol.

Antibodies—All antibodies used in the present study were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology unless otherwise stated. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Neonatal cardiomyocytes were generously provided by Dr. Motoaki Sano and handled as described previously (43Sano M. Abdellatif M. Oh H. Xie M. Bagella L. Giordano A. Michael L.H. DeMayo F.J. Schneider M.D. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). CV1 or HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed in 12-well/plate using LipofectAMINE 2000 based on the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Reporter constructs (200 ng) and different expression vectors if needed were transfected into CV1 cells in Opti-MEM I medium, using empty expression vectors to keep the total amount of DNA constant per well. CV1 cells were harvested 48 h posttransfection, and then luciferase activity assays were carried out with Monolight™3010 (Amersham Biosciences). Promoter activity was expressed as the ratio of luciferase activity induced by the presence of specific factor(s) to the control group with only the presence of empty vector. Data shown are expressed as mean ± S.E. from at least two independent assays, each carried out in duplicate. Transdifferentiation Assays—Pluripotent 10T1/2 fibroblasts were maintained at low density (<30%) in 10% fetal bovine serum plus Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in 6-cm plates prior to transfection. Transfections were performed 24 h later with GATA4 and mutants in the presence or absence of SUMO-1/PIAS1 plasmid-based expression vectors. Medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 2% horse serum to reduce proliferation. RNA was then purified from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen); 5 μg of RNA was used for reverse transcription followed by PCR assays. The sequences of all specific primers used in PCR are available upon request. Sumoylation Assay in Vitro—Recombinant proteins GST·SAE1/2, GST·Ubc9, GST·SUMO-1-GG were produced in Escherichia coli and purified using the Pierce GST purification kit according to the protocol provided by the company. In a typical sumoylation assay, 300 ng of GST·SAE1/2, 500 ng of GST·Ubc9, 500 ng of GST·SUMO-1-GG were incubated with 2 μl of 35S-labeled in vitro translated GATA4 for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCL, 5 mm MgCl2, ATP 1 mm. The reactions were terminated by addition of Nupage LDS buffer sample (Invitrogen) and subject to 10% SDS-PAGE. The results were visualized by autoradiography. Sumoylation Assay in Vivo—Wild type GATA4 or the GATA4 point mutant was transfected into HeLa cells in 6-cm plates with FLAG-SUMO-1-GG or its mutant, FLAG-SUMO-1-ΔGG. To determine whether PIAS1 potentiated the sumoylation of GATA4 in vivo, the transfections were done in the presence of PIAS1 or its RING finger mutant expression vectors. Whole cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection in the presence of 25 mm isopeptidase inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide, which prevents sumoylated proteins from desumoylation. Proteins were analyzed by PAGE and Western blotting. To detect sumoylation of endogenous GATA4, whole cell lysates were collected from neonatal cardiomyocytes and then subjected to 4-12% gradient SDS-PAGE. All blots were first tested with goat GATA4 antibody and then stripped using Western blot strip solution (Pierce) and reprobed with rabbit SUMO-1 antibody. All Western blots were visualized using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts (5 μg) purified from HeLa cells transfected with wild type GATA4 or K366R expression vector were used in binding assays performed at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of 500 ng of poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer composed of 120 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 50,000 cpm of double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides containing the GATA binding motif with the forward oligo sequence, 5′-CCCTGATAAAT GAACCCCAGCACTTTTTCGGACTACA-3′. In supershift assay, the protein was incubated for 30 min in the presence of specific GATA4 antibody. Hot probes were end-labeled by using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified through chromatography columns provided by Bio-Rad. The bindings were revealed by autoradiography. Immunobiochemistry—HeLa cells were seeded onto the glass coverslips and transfected with Myc-tagged GATA4 wild type or its mutant K366R or wild type GATA4 in the presence of Ubc9 siRNA. 48 h after transfection, the cells were rinsed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in methanol for 30 min. After they were blocked in 5% nonfat milk overnight, these cells were probed with antibodies against Myc followed by Oregon Red-labeled secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). DAPI was used to detect the location of nuclei. Images were captured in an inverted fluorescent Zeiss microscope. SUMO Modification Potentiated GATA4 Activity—Fig. 1 shows promoter transactivation assays conducted on CV1 cells cotransfected with ANF promoter luciferase reporter genes together with expression vectors driving GATA4 or SUMO-1 transcription. GATA4 or SUMO-1 alone only activated the target promoter to a small degree, whereas SUMO-1 enhanced GATA4 activation in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal level of ∼50-fold, indicating that SUMO-1 was able to up-regulate GATA4 transcriptional activity. To determine whether GATA4 was a direct substrate of SUMO-1, an in vitro assay was performed with translated 35S-labeled GATA4 protein co-incubated with recombinant sumoylation pathway components as indicated in Fig. 1B. GATA4 migrated as a single band when incubated with GST alone or in the presence of one or even two of the three sumoylation factors. A slower migrating form of GATA4 on PAGE was detected when SAE1/2, Ubc9, and SUMO-1 were present together in the reaction mixture, indicative of GATA4 acting as a SUMO-1 target (Fig. 1B, lane 5). The slower migrated GST fusion protein band was ∼45 kDa heavier than GATA4, suggesting that one moiety of GST·SUMO-1 was linked to GATA4. To verify whether GATA4 was sumoylated in vivo, Western blots were performed on lysates extracted from HeLa cells transfected with GATA4 or SUMO-1 alone or in combination with these two expression vectors and with increasing doses of SUMO-1 (0.5, 1, or 1.5 μg, respectively; Fig. 1C, lanes 3-5). Additionally, as a negative control, GATA4 was also co-transfected with various amounts of SUMO-1-ΔGG expression vector (Fig. 1C, lanes 6-8), which differed from the wild type SUMO-1-GG by the removal of two C-terminal glycines that are required for SUMO conjugation to its targets. As shown in Fig. 1C, a slower migrating band was readily observed in the presence of GATA4 and SUMO-1 by specific GATA4 antibody. Moreover, the increase in SUMO-1 levels resulted in increased intensity of the retarded band (Fig. 1C, lanes 3-5), but the band was not detected in the presence of GATA4 alone or GATA4 and SUMO-1-ΔGG (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 6-8). To further confirm that the slower migrating band observed was a SUMO-1 conjugate, the same blot was stripped and then probed with SUMO-1 antibody. Indeed, the same band was revealed as by the SUMO-1 antibody. Again, this species was not detected in the presence of GATA4 and SUMO-1-ΔGG. To further investigate the existence of the sumoylated form of endogenous GATA4, Western blots were performed on whole cell lysates purified in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide from cardiomyocytes that contain abundant GATA4. As shown in Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3, two protein bands were initially detected by GATA4 antibody, and the upper band was also detected by SUMO-1 antibody on the same blot after being stripped. Taken together, these data demonstrated that GATA4 is a SUMO-1 substrate and SUMO modification potentiated GATA4 transcriptional efficiency. Lysine 366 in GATA4 Is the Major Sumoylation Site—The SUMO-targeted lysine lies within a canonical sequence, ΨKXE. The presence of one consensus sequence conserved in GATA4 was detected in five different vertebrate species (Fig. 2A). Informatics guided our attention to lysine 366 localized in the C-terminal transactivation domain of GATA4. To determine whether lysine 366 in GATA4 is the acceptor for SUMO-1, a single point mutant was generated at Lys-366 (from K → R) in GATA4 and then tested in a sumoylation assay in vivo by cotransfections with plasmid GATA and SUMO-1 expression vectors. As shown in Fig. 2B, a sumoylated form of GATA4 was present on wild type GATA4 but not on K366R. Clearly, these data demonstrated that the major sumoylation site on GATA4 is lysine residue 366. We then asked whether the mutated sumoylation site would affect the activation capacity of the GATA4 mutant. As shown in Fig. 2C, only wild type GATA4 with SUMO-1 increased ANF promoter activation and K366R was unable to drive promoter activity, suggesting that the sumoylation site influenced GATA4 activity. These data indicated that the function of GATA4 was enhanced via sumoylation on lysine residue 366 and was depressed by the mutation on that site. Mutation on Major Sumoylation Site of GATA4 Did Not Affect Its DNA Binding Activity but Impacted Its Nucleocytoplasmic Translocation—One of the mechanisms by which SUMO regulates the function of its target proteins is to alter DNA binding activity (9Goodson M.L. Hong Y. Rogers R. Matunis M.J. Park-Sarge O.K. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18513-18518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 44Melchior F. Hengst L. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of DNA binding affinity for GATA4 transcriptional function, we asked whether the mutated SUMO target site would affect GATA4 DNA binding affinity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was conducted on the nuclear extract prepared from CV1 cells transfected with GATA4 wild type or K366R. The oligo tested here is from Nkx2.5 enhancer containing one GATA binding site. The results show that mutant K366R exhibited the same DNA binding intensity as wild type GATA4 (Fig. 3A, upper panel) when they are equivalently expressed in the nucleus (Fig. 3A, lower panel). GATA4 binding specificity was further confirmed by the application of GATA4-specific antibody. Another mechanism by which SUMO might alter its target function would involve changing its nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation (3Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Brunicardi F.C. Feng X.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31043-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We asked whether the mutated sumoylation sites would influence GATA4 nuclear localization, because GATA4 is usually localized to the nucleus. Immunofluorescent staining was performed on HeLa cells transfected with Myc-tagged GATA4 wt or K366R or wild type GATA4 together with Ubc9 siRNA (Fig. 3B). Myc antibody was used to verify the GATA4 location. DAPI was applied to identify the nucleus. ∼15% of the GATA4-transfected cells showed diffused cytoplasmic and nuclear staining under our experimental conditions. However, mutation on Lys-366 resulted in an increase of cytoplasmic staining up to 23%. To further investigate whether sumoylation pathway contributes to GATA4 nuclear localization, Ubc9 siRNA, which specifically inhibited Ubc9 function in HeLa cells (3Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Brunicardi F.C. Feng X.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31043-31048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), was cotransfected with wild type GATA4 into HeLa cells. Inhibition of Ubc9 led to an increase in GATA4 diffusion to cytoplasm up to 33%, indicating that SUMO conjugation played a role in GATA4 nuclear translocation. These data suggest that GATA4 nuclear occupancy is at least partially attributable to the SUMO modification of GATA4 on lysine 366. PIAS1 Regulated GATA4 Sumoylation via Its RING Finger—E3 ligases, such as the PIAS family, may substantially enhance the efficiency of sumoylation. To investigate the role of PIAS1 in GATA4 sumoylation in vivo, HeLa cells were transfected with wild type GATA4 and SUMO-1 in the presence or absence of PIAS1. As indicated in Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 3, intensified multisumoylated forms of GATA4 were observed that depend upon the presence of PIAS1. As a negative control, SUMO-1-ΔGG abolished the slower migrated GATA4-SUMO bands induced by the presence of PIAS1 (Fig. 4A, lane 5), thus indicating that the two retarded bands were SUMO-1 conjugates. We then asked which domain in PIAS1 was responsible for potentiating GATA4 sumoylation reaction. The RING domain contains E3 ligase activity (28Kotaja N. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5222-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and the PIAS1 mutant in the RING finger (C345S/C350S/C355S) led to the loss of intensified slower migrating bands as observed with wild type PIAS1 (Fig. 4A, compare lane 3 with 4); thus, enhanced SUMO modification of GATA4 by PIAS1 is attributable to its RING domain. As shown in Fig. 4B, mutation on Lys-366 caused the loss of two sumoylated forms of GATA4 by PIAS1, suggesting that lysine 366 is the primary SUMO target site located in GATA4 enhanced by PIAS1. Because PIAS1 stimulated GATA4 sumoylation, did PIAS1 also affect GATA4 functional activity? GATA4, SUMO-1, or PIAS1 were transfected alone or in various combinations into CV1 cells together with the ANF promoter-driving luciferase reporter construct as shown in Fig. 4C. PIAS1 alone hardly activated the ANF promoter and neither did SUMO-1. A modest synergy was observed between PIAS1 and GATA4 or GATA4 and SUMO-1 in stimulating the target promoter. However, the highest level of cooperative activation of the ANF promoter was observed among the co-transfectants, SUMO1, PIAS1, and GATA4, by ∼35-fold. To further confirm that the RING domain of PIAS1 was critical to the combinatorial synergy among these three factors, we substituted wild type PIAS1 with the RING finger mutant exhibiting no E3 ligase activity in the transactivation assay, which reduced the synergy achieved by wild type PIAS1 from ∼35-fold to less than 10-fold. Taken together, PIAS1 regulated GATA4 transcriptional activation capacity through enhancement of SUMO modification of GATA4 via its conserved RING finger domain. GATA4 Induced Cardiac-specific Genes Expression in Fibroblast 10T1/2 Cells in the Presence of SUMO-1 and/or PIAS1— Because of the pivotal role GATA4 plays in cardiomyocyte gene activity and differentiation, we asked whether SUMO-1 and GATA4 were sufficient to drive endogenous cardiac-specified gene activity in 10T1/2 fibroblasts, as a"
https://openalex.org/W2019324150,"Statins are drugs widely used in humans to treat hypercholesterolemia. Statins act by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis resulting in the activation of the transcription factor sterol-responsive element-binding protein-2 that controls the expression of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Statin therapy also decreases plasma triglyceride and non-esterified fatty acid levels, but the mechanism behind this effect remains more elusive. Liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) plays a role in the influx of long-chain fatty acids into hepatocytes. Here we show that L-FABP is a target for statins. In rat hepatocytes, simvastatin treatment induced L-FABP mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, L-FABP promoter activity was induced by statin treatment. Progressive 5′-deletion analysis revealed that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-responsive element located at position –67/–55 was responsible for the statin-mediated transactivation of the rat L-FABP promoter. Moreover, treatment with simvastatin and the PPARα agonist Wy14,649 resulted in a synergistic induction of L-FABP expression (mRNA and protein) in rat Fao hepatoma cells. This effect was also observed in vivo in wild-type mice but not in PPARα-null animals demonstrating the direct implication of PPARα in L-FABP regulation by statin treatment. Statin treatment resulted in a rise in PPARα mRNA levels both in vitro and in vivo and activated the mouse PPARα promoter in a reporter assay. Altogether, these data demonstrate that L-FABP expression is up-regulated by statins through a mechanism involving PPARα. Moreover, PPARα might be a statin target gene. These effects might contribute to the triglyceride/non-esterified fatty acid-lowering properties of statins. Statins are drugs widely used in humans to treat hypercholesterolemia.

Statins are competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. The resulting lower intracellular cholesterol concentration after statin treatment leads to a proteolytic activation of the transcription factor sterol responsive element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), 1The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol responsive element-binding protein; LDL, low density lipoproteins; LDLr, LDL receptor; TG, triglycerides; NEFA, non-esterified fatty acids; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; L-FABP, liver fatty acid-binding protein; LCFA, long-chain fatty acid; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; WT, wild type; FCS, fetal calf serum; ACO, acyl-CoA oxidase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PPRE, PPAR-responsive element; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; SRE, sterol regulatory element.1The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol responsive element-binding protein; LDL, low density lipoproteins; LDLr, LDL receptor; TG, triglycerides; NEFA, non-esterified fatty acids; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; L-FABP, liver fatty acid-binding protein; LCFA, long-chain fatty acid; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; WT, wild type; FCS, fetal calf serum; ACO, acyl-CoA oxidase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PPRE, PPAR-responsive element; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; SRE, sterol regulatory element. which up-regulates several genes controlling cholesterol homeostasis, including the LDL receptor (LDLr) (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Induction of LDLr in the liver enhances clearance of circulating LDL resulting in decreased plasma LDL-cholesterol levels. Statins also increase, at least in part via a PPARα-dependent mechanism (2Martin G. Duez H. Blanquart C. Berezowski V. Poulain P. Fruchart J.C. Najib-Fruchart J. Glineur C. Staels B. J. Clin.

By contrast, it is not known if statins control the cellular uptake and the metabolic fate of lipids. Moreover, the NEFA lowering effect of statins is not yet explained.Liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) is a cytoplasmic protein exhibiting a strong affinity for long-chain fatty acids (LCFA). It is highly expressed in liver, where it represents more than 5% of cytosolic proteins (14Veerkamp J.H. Maatman R.G. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 17-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The transcription rate of the L-FABP gene is tightly regulated and induced by both fibrate hypolipidemic drugs and LCFA through a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-responsive element located in the proximal part of the promoter. Several lines of evidence show that L-FABP participates in the cellular uptake and trafficking of LCFA. Using stably transfected L-cell fibroblasts it was shown that L-FABP overexpression leads to an increased uptake of LCFA (15Murphy E.J. Prows D.R. Jefferson J.R. Schroeder F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Conversely, antisense L-FABP knock-down reduced cellular LCFA influx in a dose-dependent manner in HepG2 cells (16Wolfrum C. Buhlmann C. Rolf B. Borchers T. Spener F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). L-FABP expression can also affect the metabolic fate of LCFA. Indeed, overexpression of L-FABP was reported to be associated with an induced β-oxidation activity in McA-RH7777 hepatoma cells (17Linden D. Lindberg K. Oscarsson J. Claesson C. Asp L. Li L. Gustafsson M. Boren J. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23044-23053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the mouse, targeted deletion of the L-FABP gene resulted in a reduced rate of LCFA uptake by the liver under conditions of high lipid supply (e.g. intravenous LCFA bolus or prolonged fasting) (18Martin G.G.

Fasted L-FABP-null mice were characterized by lower hepatic TG synthesis and fatty acid oxidation than wild-type controls (19Newberry E.P. Xie Y. Kennedy S. Han X. Buhman K.K. Luo J. Gross R.W.

FASEB J. 2004; 18: 347-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This phenotype is likely caused by the limitation of cellular LCFA availability for further metabolic use (i.e. esterification and oxidation) under high fatty acid load.Altogether, these findings highlight the pivotal role exerted by L-FABP in hepatic lipid disposal and metabolic utilization. In the present study, we evaluated whether the hypolipidemic effect of statins is associated with an up-regulation of L-FABP expression in liver.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterials—Simvastatin was kindly provided by Merck Research Laboratories (Rahway, NJ). Fenofibrate and Wy14,643 were purchased from Sigma. All products for cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen.Triglyceride Measurement—Plasma triglyceride concentrations were determined by an enzymatic assay adapted to microtiter plates using commercially available reagents (Roche Applied Science).Animals and Experimental Treatments—French guidelines for the use and care of laboratory animals were followed. Wild-type or PPARα-null mice in the SV129 background (a kind gift of F. Gonzalez, Laboratory of Metabolism, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) were used. Animals were housed individually in a controlled environment (constant temperature and humidity, darkness from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.) and fed ad libitum a standard chow (UAR A04, Usine d'Alimentation Rationnelle). PPARα(+/+) and PPARα(–/–) mice were force-fed for 5 days with simvastatin (100 mg/kg) and/or fenofibrate (40 mg/kg). Controls received the vehicle alone (1% carboxymethyl cellulose) by the same route. After sacrifice, livers were removed, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until RNA extraction.Cell Culture and Treatments—Rat hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion according to the modified procedure of Seglen (21Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 82: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were plated in 60-mm dishes in Williams E medium (Invitrogen) containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). After an attachment period of 6 h, the culture medium was replaced by serum-free medium, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h with 2.4–24 μm simvastatin. Control cultures received the vehicle alone (2 μl/ml ethanol).Rat Fao hepatoma cells (passages 20–30) were cultured in a controlled environment (37 °C, 5% CO2) in Ham's F-12 medium, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin supplemented with 10% FCS. On the first day of confluency, cells were incubated for 24 h in the culture medium in the presence of Wy14,643 (10 μm) or simvastatin (12 μm) alone or in combination. Control cultures received the vehicle alone (2 μl/ml ethanol).Caco-2 cells (passages 35–45), used for transfection experiments, were cultured in a controlled environment (37 °C, 5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 4 mm glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin supplemented with 20% FCS. Medium was changed every 2 days.Northern Blotting—Total RNAs were extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and then transferred to GeneScreen membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using previously published procedures (22Besnard P. Mallordy A. Carlier H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Rat L-FABP and rat acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, ICN) using the Prime-It RmT Random Primer Labeling kit (Stratagene). A 24-residue oligonucleotide specific for rat 18 S rRNA was used as probe to ensure that equivalent amounts of RNAs were loaded and transferred. This oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, ICN).Real Time Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—PPARα and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA or 28 S rRNA levels were determined by real time reverse transcriptase-PCR. RNA integrity was checked by ethidium bromide staining after electrophoresis. The cDNA was produced from total RNA (1 μg) by reverse transcription using Superscript reverse transcriptase (200 units, Invitrogen) in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 1× Superscript buffer (Invitrogen), 1 mm dNTP, 20 ng of random hexamers, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 units of RNase inhibitors. After 50 min at 42 °C incubation, the reaction was stopped (10 min at 70 °C). PCR amplification of PPARα and GAPDH or 28 S used Syber PCR master mix and the following primer sequences: PPARα (forward, 5′-CCTCTTCCCAAAGCTCCTTCA-3′; reverse, 5′-GTACGAGCTGCGCATGCTC-3′), GAPDH (forward, 5′-TTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGA-3′), 28 S (23Bonazzi A.

Optimized PCR consisted of 40 cycles of amplification at 95 °C for 15 s followed by amplification at 60 °C for 1 min using the Abi Prism 7700 Sequence detection system (Qiagen). Significant PCR fluorescent signals were normalized for each sample to a PCR fluorescent signal obtained using GAPDH or 28 S rRNA as control. The comparative ΔΔCT method was used for the relative mRNA quantification.Relative quantification of the target normalized to an endogenous reference gene (GAPDH or 28 S) and to a relevant control was calculated as follows: relative quantification = 2–ΔΔCT, with ΔΔCT defined as the difference between the mean ΔCT(sample) and the mean ΔCT(control), and ΔCT as the difference between the mean CT(PPARα) and the CT(GAPDH or 28 S) as the endogenous control (CT = threshold cycles).Relative L-FABP Protein Quantification—Liver homogenates were prepared in ice-cold 0.154 m KCl, 0.01 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, using a glass Teflon potter. Proteins were quantified using the BCA Assay kit according the manufacturer's protocol (Uptima, Interchim). 100 μg of sample was used for L-FABP dosage using the Rat L-FABP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test kit (Hycult Biotechnology).Plasmid Construction—The –4000/+22 rat L-FABP promoter (kindly provided by Dr. J. I. Gordon, St Louis, MO) was cloned into the pCAT3-basic vector (Promega). L-FABP 4000wt was used to generate the following promoter sequences by PCR: L-FABP 275wt, L-FABP 225wt, L-FABP 175wt, L-FABP 125wt, and L-FABP 75wt. Constructs harboring mutations of the PPAR-responsive element (PPRE) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CGACAATCACTGAGCGGCCGCCTATTTTGAGGAGGAAGAAGCCC-3′ for L-FABP 275mut (PPRE in bold, point mutations are underlined) and 5′-GGCCATAAAGAAATCAAATCACTATATTTGAGGAGGAAGAAGCC-3′ for L-FABP 275del (PPRE deleted), respectively. All constructs were checked by restriction digestion analysis. The –1000/+60 (mPPARα) bp fragment of the mouse PPARα promoter (24Pineda Torra I. Claudel T. Duval C. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pCAT3-basic vector.Transfection Assays—Caco-2 cells were plated in 6-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS at 40–50% confluency. Transfection mixes contained 4 μg of L-FABP-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or mPPARα-CAT reporter plasmid and 500 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector. Cells were transfected overnight by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The medium was changed, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was supplemented with 1% of lipoprotein-depleted serum alone or with various simvastatin concentrations (from 2.4–24 μm) was added to the cells for an additional 24-h period.

Statistically, significant differences between groups were determined by Student's t test.RESULTSSimvastatin Induces L-FABP mRNA Levels in Primary Rat Hepatocytes—To determine whether the expression of L-FABP gene is regulated by statins, rat hepatocytes were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of simvastatin. As shown in Fig. 1, L-FABP mRNA levels were increased in a dose-dependent manner by simvastatin. Indeed, a 1.9- and 2.9-fold rise of L-FABP mRNA was found after incubation with 12 and 24 μm simvastatin, respectively.Simvastatin-responsiveness of the L-FABP Promoter Is Mediated by Its PPRE—Statins act on gene transcription by activating SREBP-2, which specifically up-regulates genes containing sterol regulatory elements (SRE) and/or E-boxes (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 25Shimano H. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Three putative SREBP-binding sites were localized in the rat L-FABP promoter by in silico analysis: two SRE-like sequences located at positions –801/–790 and –245/–233, respectively, and an E-box at position –306/–301 (Fig. 2A). To explore their respective functionality, the effect of progressive 5′-deletions of the L-FABP promoter on the capacity of simvastatin to transactivate the CAT reporter gene was determined by transfection analysis. Surprisingly, activation by simvastatin was observed even when constructs that did not contain any SRE or E-box (Fig. 2B). This unexpected result demonstrates that these putative sequences are not SREBP-binding sites. The fact that the L-FABP 75wt sequence contains a PPRE known to be crucial for the regulation of the L-FABP gene by fibrates led us to evaluate the possible involvement of this PPAR-binding site in this regulation. Interestingly, mutations in the PPRE (L-FABP 275mut and L-FABP 275del) fully abolished the activation of the L-FABP promoter by simvastatin (Fig. 2C). This unresponsiveness was not caused by functional alterations of the promoter constructs used because the L-FABP gene regulator hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (26Akiyama T.E. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27117-27122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was still able to transactivate a reporter gene driven by the mutated or deleted promoters (data not shown). Taken together these data suggest that the PPRE is implicated in the up-regulation of L-FABP by simvastatin.Fig. 2The PPAR-responsive element mediates statin induction of rat L-FABP promoter activity.A, the rat L-FABP promoter sequence was analyzed in silico using MatInspector. The proximal part of promoter (–821/+19) revealed the existence of two putative sterol responsive elements (SRE 1 and 2) located at position –801/–790 and –245/–233 and one E-box at –306/–301. The previously identified PPRE is located at position –67/–55. B, Caco-2 cells were transiently transfected with 5′-progressive deleted constructs of the L-FABP promoter (L-FABP 4000wt, L-FABP 275wt, L-FABP 225wt, L-FABP 175wt, L-FABP 125wt, and L-FABP 75wt). C, Caco-2 cells were transiently transfected with the various constructs harboring ponctual or total mutations of the PPRE (L-FABP 275mut, L-FABP 275del). Cells were transfected in 10% FCS medium for 12 h. Cells were cultured for an additional 24 h in medium containing 1% lipoprotein-deprived serum in presence or absence of 12 μm simvastatin.

This cell line was chosen because it was previously used to study PPAR-mediated regulation of the L-FABP gene by LCFA (27Meunier-Durmort C. Poirier H. Niot I. Forest C. Besnard P. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As observed in primary rat hepatocyte cultures, simvastatin robustly induced L-FABP mRNA levels to an extent similar as Wy14,643. Co-treatment with simvastatin and the PPARα agonist triggered a synergistic rise of L-FABP mRNA levels, which were induced by more than 60-fold compared with controls (Fig. 3). Interestingly, similar effects were also found for ACO, the rate-limiting enzyme of peroxisomal β-oxidation, a prototypical PPARα target gene (28Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). These observations demonstrate that this regulatory pathway is not restricted to the L-FABP gene (Fig. 3).Fig. 3L-FABP mRNA levels are synergistically induced by simvastatin and PPARα agonists in vitro. Fao cells were cultured for 24 h in standard culture medium containing 10 μm Wy14,643 (WY) or 12 μm simvastatin (Sim) or both 10 μm Wy14,643 and 12 μm simvastatin (Sim+WY). Control cultures received the vehicle alone (2 μl/ml ethanol). Total RNAs were extracted with TRIzol reagent. 30 μg were used for Northern blotting analysis using L-FABP and ACO probes.

In wild-type mice, in line with the results obtained in Fao cells, simvastatin and fenofibrate alone up-regulated L-FABP mRNA levels, and co-treatment exerted a drastic synergistic effect (Fig. 4A). These changes were associated with a rise in L-FABP protein amounts, although combined treatment did not produce an additive induction (Fig. 4B). These treatments also induced ACO mRNA levels (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, whereas plasma triglycerides did not change when simvastatin or fenofibrate were given alone, combined treatment resulted in a significant drop in plasma TG levels (81 ± 5 in simvastatin/fenofibrate treated animals versus 117 ± 12 mg/dl in controls, Fig. 5). By contrast, deletion of the PPARα gene fully abolished the statin-mediated up-regulation of L-FABP expression (mRNA and protein levels, Fig. 4, A and B), ACO mRNA levels (Fig. 4C) and the decrease of plasma TG (Fig. 5), demonstrating the crucial role of PPARα in the induction of L-FABP gene expression by statins.Fig. 4PPARα mediates the synergistic up-regulation of L-FABP gene expression by simvastatin/fenofibrate. SV129 PPARα (+/+) or PPARα (–/–) mice (n = 6/group) were force fed daily with 200 μl of simvastatin (100 mg/kg, Sim) and/or fenofibrate (40 mg/kg, Feno) for 5 days.

As shown in Fig. 6A, expression of this nuclear receptor was significantly induced by simvastatin in Fao cells as well as in wild-type mice. To further investigate the mechanism by which this regulation takes place, transfection studies were performed using a construct containing the mouse PPARα promoter cloned upstream of the CAT reporter gene. Increasing concentrations of simvastatin produced a dose-dependent transactivation of the reporter gene (Fig. 6B), which strongly supports the hypothesis of a transcriptional control of PPARα gene expression by statins.Fig. 6PPARα mRNA and promoter activity are up-regulated by simvastatin.A, PPARα mRNA levels were evaluated in Fao hepatoma cells and in liver from wild-type mice by real time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR.

Statins act through the activation of SREBP-2 that controls genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Statin treatment also normalizes blood TG and NEFA levels, but the mechanism is not yet fully understood. Although the expression of the LDLr, known to be involved in the LDL clearance, is induced by statins (29Makar R.S. Lipsky P.E. Cuthbert J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1647-1654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this change cannot fully explain the hypotriglyceridemic action of these drugs. Indeed, TG levels are still decreased by statins in patients suffering from familial hypercholesterolemia in which the LDLr is not functional (30Raal F.J. Pappu A.S. Illingworth D.R. Pilcher G.J.

A phenylurea series of chemical inhibitors of XIAP was recently generated by our laboratories (Schimmer, A. D., Welsh, K., Pinilla, C., Bonneau, M., Wang, Z., Pedersen, I. M., Scott, F. L., Glinsky, G. V., Scudiero, D. A., Sausville, E., Salvesen, G., Nefzi, A., Ostresh, J. M., Houghten, R. A., and Reed, J. C. (2004) Cancer Cell 5, 25–35). We examined the mechanisms of action of these chemical compounds using biochemical, molecular biological, and genetic methods. Active phenylurea-based compounds dissociated effector protease caspase-3 but not initiator protease caspase-9 from XIAP in vitro and restored caspase-3 but not caspase-9 enzymatic activity. When applied to tumor cell lines in culture, active phenylurea-based compounds induced apoptosis in a rapid, concentration-dependent manner, associated with activation of cellular caspases. Apoptosis induced by active phenylurea-based compounds was blocked by chemical inhibitors of caspases, with inhibitors of downstream effector caspases displaying more effective suppression than inhibitors of upstream initiator caspases. Phenylurea-based XIAP antagonists induced apoptosis (defined by annexin V staining) prior to mitochondrial membrane depolarization, in contrast to cytotoxic anticancer drugs. Consistent with these findings, apoptosis induced by phenylurea-based compounds was not altered by genetic alterations in the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins that control mitochondria-dependent cell death pathways, including over-expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL and genetic ablation of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak. Conversely, conditional over-expression of an active fragment of XIAP or genetic ablation of XIAP expression altered the apoptosis doseresponse of the compounds. Altogether, these findings indicate that phenylurea-based XIAP antagonists block interaction of downstream effector caspases with XIAP, thus inducing apoptosis of tumor cell lines through a caspase-dependent, Bcl-2/Bax-independent mechanism. XIAP is member of the IAP family of anti-apoptotic proteins and is known for its ability to bind and suppress caspase family cell death proteases.

Defects in apoptosis play important roles in cancer pathogenesis and progression and have been linked to chemoresistance, radioresistance, and hormonal therapy failures (1Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar, 2Lowe S.W. Lin A.W. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). A need exists therefore to reduce the roadblocks to apoptosis in advanced cancers, placing tumor cells into a more vulnerable state and making them easier to eradicate. Caspases are the principal mediators of apoptosis (3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar, 4Cryns V. Yuan Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 12: 1551-1570Crossref Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). These intracellular proteases become activated in response to various cell death stimuli, triggering a characteristic set of biochemical reactions responsible for cellular demise in the context of normal cell turnover and immune-based elimination of virus-infected and malignant cells. Caspases cleave and activate each other in proteolytic networks, characterized by upstream initiator proteases (e.g. caspases 2, 8, 9, and 10) and downstream effector proteases (e.g. caspases 3, 6, and 7) (5Salvesen G.S.

We recently described small molecule chemical inhibitors of the IAP family member XIAP, showing that these compounds induce apoptosis of cancer cell lines and primary leukemia specimens in culture and display anti-tumor activity in mouse xenograft models (44Schimmer A.D. Welsh K. Pinilla C. Bonneau M. Wang Z. Pedersen I.M. Scott F.L. Glinsky G.V. Scudiero D.A. Sausville E. Salvesen G. Nefzi A. Ostresh J.M. Houghten R.A. Reed J.C. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 25-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Here, we have extended these studies, exploring the mechanisms of action of these chemical inhibitors and addressing questions about the apoptosis pathways that they activate in tumor cells and the roadblocks to apoptosis that these compounds bypass or overcome. Altogether, the results show that these IAP-binding compounds activate a downstream point in apoptosis pathways, releasing effector caspases to induce apoptosis and thus functioning distal to the actions of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, which are commonly over-expressed in chemoresistant cancers. Chemical Compounds—XIAP antagonist polyphenylurea compounds were identified by screening mixture-based combinatorial chemical libraries for compounds that reversed XIAP-mediated repression of caspase-3 in a high-throughput enzyme derepression assay in vitro (44Schimmer A.D. Welsh K. Pinilla C. Bonneau M. Wang Z. Pedersen I.M. Scott F.L. Glinsky G.V. Scudiero D.A. Sausville E. Salvesen G. Nefzi A. Ostresh J.M. Houghten R.A. Reed J.C.

Individual compounds were synthesized by solid-phase methods, purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and analyzed by mass spectrometry to confirm identity and >90% purity. Data for prototype active XIAP antagonists are based on more than one independent preparation of purified compound. All compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and stored at -20 °C. Compounds were subsequently diluted in RPMI 1640 medium so that the final concentration of Me2SO was in all cases <0.05% (v/v). Cell Culture—Jurkat, MDA-MB-468, and HeLa cells were maintained in either RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. 697-neo and 697-Bcl-2 stable transfectants have been described (45Miyashita T.

Mouse fibroblasts established from bax-/-bak-/- or xiap-/- embryos by transformation with SV40 large T antigen have been described (46Wei M.C. Zong W.-X. Cheng E.H.-Y. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V.

HeLa Tet-on cells that stably express reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) regulator protein or HeLa Tet-off cells that stably express tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) were obtained from Clontech, Inc. Plasmid Construction and Cell Transfections—The tetracycline-inducible or -repressible plasmids, pTRE2-hyg expression vectors, were obtained from Clontech, Inc. cDNAs encoding full-length CrmA, Bcl-XL, or BI-1 or encoding a fragment of XIAP encompassing the BIR2 and BIR3 domains (residues 124–356) were subcloned into pTRE2-hyg vectors. Plasmids were transfected into HeLa-tet-on or HeLa-tet-off cells using LipofectAMINE-Plus, and stable clones derived from individual colonies were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% of Tet-system-approved fetal bovine serum (Clontech) in the presence of 400 μg/ml hygromycin. To test for the induced expression of these genes, stable clones were left untreated or treated for 24 h with 1 μg/ml doxycycline, harvested, and analyzed for expression of the appropriate protein by immunoblot as described. For each case, several clones displaying conditional expression were identified. Apoptosis and Cell Death Assays—For annexin V assays, 106 cells were double-stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide using a kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bivision, Moutain View, CA). The percentage of apoptotic (annexin V positive) cells was determined by flow cytometric analysis (BD Biosciences). Alternatively, cell viability was assessed by a dye exclusion method using a 96-well compatible flow cytometer and the ViaCount assay reagent (Guava Technologies, Inc.). Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was monitored by flow cytometry using 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar) (48Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Marchetti P. Hirsch T. Gomez-Monterrey I. Castedo M. Guido K. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Caspase Activity Assays—Effector caspase activity in cell lysates was examined using substrates acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AFC) according to a standard protocol (Bio-Rad). Activity was measured using fMax spectrofluorometer plate reader (excitation at 405 nm and emission at 510 nm) (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) to measure relative fluorogenic product, normalized relative to total protein content. Protein Interaction Assays—GST pull-down experiments were performed using the ProFound pull-down GST protein-protein interaction kit (Pierce). Purified GST-XIAP protein (1 μg) and caspase-3 or caspase-9 (0.5 μg) were incubated with 20 μl of glutathione beads for 1 h in 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) solution followed by three washes with 1 ml of PBS. Various amounts of chemical or peptide XIAP antagonists were then added to the beads, and the mixture was incubated for another 2 h. After five washes, the bound proteins were eluted using 100 mm free reduced glutathione in PBS. Each sample was separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE in an acrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the resulting blots were incubated with various antibodies as described below. Immunoblotting—Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (49Krajewski S. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In brief, for each sample, 25 μg of protein/lane was separated by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE (ISC Bio-Expree, Kaysville, UT) and electroblotted to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). Blots were incubated in PBS-Tween 20 (0.05%) supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated for 2 h in fresh blocking solution with an appropriate dilution of primary antibodies as follows: polyclonal rabbit-antihuman caspase-3, 1:1000 (50Krajewska M.

Blots were washed three times for 5 min in PBS-Tween 20 and then incubated with a 1:2000 (v/v) dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) for 1 h. Blots were again washed three times for 5 min in PBS-Tween 20 and then developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). We exploited the ability of IAPs to suppress active caspases in vitro, developing a high throughput screening assay for identification of compounds that block the caspase-suppressing activity of these anti-apoptotic proteins (44Schimmer A.D. Welsh K. Pinilla C. Bonneau M. Wang Z. Pedersen I.M. Scott F.L. Glinsky G.V. Scudiero D.A. Sausville E. Salvesen G. Nefzi A. Ostresh J.M. Houghten R.A. Reed J.C. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 25-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This assay utilized purified protein components in an enzyme derepression assay employing human XIAP and caspase-3. Compounds were identified that inhibited XIAP by releasing caspase-3 to cleave the fluorogenic peptide substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC. We reported an initial characterization of a series of active phenylureas, including 1396-11, and 1396-34 and inactive structural analogs such as 1396-28, showing that active (but not inactive) compounds induce apoptosis of a wide range of human tumor cell lines in culture (44Schimmer A.D. Welsh K. Pinilla C. Bonneau M. Wang Z. Pedersen I.M. Scott F.L. Glinsky G.V. Scudiero D.A. Sausville E. Salvesen G. Nefzi A. Ostresh J.M. Houghten R.A. Reed J.C.

Here we extended those studies to further characterize the mechanism of action of these XIAP-inhibitory compounds using a combination of cellular, biochemical, and genetic methods. IAP-inhibitory Compounds Displace Effector but Not Initiator Caspases from XIAP—The XIAP protein comprises three tandem BIR domains followed by a C-terminal RING domain. Previous studies showed that the BIR2 domain and an upstream flanking segment of XIAP are sufficient to bind and inhibit caspase-3 (17Takahashi R. Deveraux Q.L. Tamm I. Welsh K. Assa-Munt N.

We therefore compared the ability of our active phenylurea series compounds to displace effector protease caspase-3 and an initiator protease caspase-9 from BIR2 and BIR3 of XIAP, respectively, making comparisons with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N terminus of SMAC, an endogenous antagonist of IAPs (54Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L. Wu J.-W. Du C. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Active compounds such as 1396-11 displaced caspase-3 from GST-BIR2, as assessed in GST pull-down assays (Fig. 1A), and although structurally related, inactive control compounds such 1396-28 did not. NMR-based binding assays also showed that active (but not inactive) analogs of the compounds directly bind purified recombinant BIR2 of XIAP but not caspase-3. 2Z. Wang, K. Welsh, C. Pinilla, M. Pellechia, and J. C. Reed, unpublished observations. In contrast to caspase-3, active phenylurea-based XIAP antagonists did not displace caspase-9 from GST-BIR3. By comparison, SMAC peptide displaced both caspase-3 and caspase-9 as predicted (54Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L. Wu J.-W. Du C. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 55Chai J. Du C. Wu J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 56Shi Y. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Consistent with these protein binding data, active phenylurea series compounds such as 1396-11 restored caspase-3 but not caspase-9 activity in XIAP-inhibited reactions in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B), consistent with our recently reported data (44Schimmer A.D. Welsh K. Pinilla C. Bonneau M. Wang Z. Pedersen I.M. Scott F.L. Glinsky G.V. Scudiero D.A. Sausville E. Salvesen G. Nefzi A. Ostresh J.M. Houghten R.A. Reed J.C. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 25-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). To determine whether the compounds could activate pro-caspase-3 in vitro, purified pro-caspase-3 was incubated with various concentrations of active XIAP inhibitors. As expected, none of our compounds induces activation of procaspase-3 in vitro (data not shown). We conclude therefore that our phenylurea series compounds selectively target the BIR2 domain of XIAP. Furthermore, in vitro competition assays showed that these active compounds do not bind the same site as SMAC peptide on full-length XIAP and on the isolated BIR2 domain (44Schimmer A.D. Welsh K. Pinilla C. Bonneau M. Wang Z. Pedersen I.M. Scott F.L. Glinsky G.V. Scudiero D.A. Sausville E. Salvesen G. Nefzi A. Ostresh J.M. Houghten R.A. Reed J.C. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 25-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Thus, the phenylurea series XIAP antagonists are not SMAC mimics. XIAP Antagonists Induce Cellular Apoptosis through a Caspase-dependent Pathway—We characterized the effects of XIAP antagonists at the cellular level. Active XIAP antagonists such as 1396-11 induced rapid, concentration-dependent apoptosis of a variety of tumor cell lines in culture, including HeLa cervical cancer, MDA-MB-468 breast cancer, and Jurkat leukemia cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, inactive phenylureas such as 1396-28 did not induce apoptosis. The concentration of active phenylurea-based compounds required to induce apoptosis of 50% of tumor cells within 24 h ranged from 5 to 10 μm. Apoptosis was detected as early as 4–8 h after addition of active compounds, indicating a rapid onset of action. The apoptosis induced by these active phenylurea-based compounds was associated with activation of caspases, as measured in cell lysates with a fluorogenic substrate peptide, Ac-DEVD-AFC (Fig. 3A). The activation of caspases was suppressible by co-culturing the cells with a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, prior to producing cell lysates (Fig. 3A). Active XIAP antagonists such as 1396-11 also induced proteolytic cleavage of effector protease caspase-3, as demonstrated by immunoblotting methods (Fig. 3C). To further characterize the mechanism of our XIAP antagonists, we compared the ability of various peptidyl caspase inhibitors to block apoptosis induced by active compounds such as 1396-11. Selective caspase-3 and -7 inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-fmk) was compared with partially selective inhibitors of upstream initiator proteases caspase-8 and -10 (Ac-IETD-fmk), caspase-9 (Ac-LEHD-fmk), and downstream effector caspase-6 (Ac-VEID-fmk). Although DEVD effectively blocked apoptosis induction by active phenylurea-based IAP antagonists, the other selective inhibitors, IETD, LEHD, and VEID, did not (Fig. 3D). In contrast, when we used the kinase inhibitor staurosporine (STS), a known activator of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway for apoptosis (11Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the caspase-9-selective inhibitor Ac-LEHD-fmk partially inhibited apoptosis. Also, when TRAIL protein (representing an activator of the extrinsic death-receptor pathway for apoptosis) was used, all of the caspase inhibitors displayed anti-apoptotic activity (Fig. 3D).

We previously cloned the promoter region of the COMP gene and delineated a minimal negative regulatory element (NRE) that is both necessary and sufficient to repress its promoter (Issack, P. S., Fang, C. H., Leslie, M. P., and Di Cesare, P. E. (2000) J. Orthop. Res. 18, 345–350; Issack, P. S., Liu, C. J., Prazak, L., and Di Cesare, P. E. (2004) J. Orthop. Res. 22, 751–758). In this study, a yeast one-hybrid screen for proteins that associate with the NRE led to the identification of the leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF), a transcriptional repressor that contains a POZ (poxvirus zinc finger) domain, as an NRE-binding protein. LRF bound directly to the NRE both in vitro and in living cells. Nine nucleotides (GAGGGTCCC) in the 30-bp NRE are essential for binding to LRF. LRF showed dose-dependent inhibition of COMP-specific reporter gene activity, and exogenous overexpression of LRF repressed COMP gene expression in both rat chondrosarcoma cells and bone morphogenetic protein-2-treated C3H10T1/2 progenitor cells. In addition, LRF also inhibited bone morphogenetic protein-2-induced chondrogenesis in high density micromass cultures of C3H10T1/2 cells, as evidenced by lack of expression of other chondrocytic markers, such as aggrecan and collagen types II, IX, X, and XI, and by Alcian blue staining. LRF associated with histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1), and experiments utilizing the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A revealed that LRF-mediated repression requires deacetylase activity. LRF is the first transcription factor found to bind directly to the COMP gene promoter, to recruit HDAC1, and to regulate both COMP gene expression and chondrogenic differentiation.

The differentiation of uncommitted mesenchymal cells into musculoskeletal tissues, including chondrocytes, osteoblasts, tenocytes, and ligament cells, is a fundamental molecular event of both embryonic development and repair of cartilage, ligament, tendon, and bone (1Ferguson C.M.

To delineate cis-elements in the COMP promoter necessary for expression in any of these tissues, we cloned the murine COMP promoter and identified cis-elements necessary for expression in the chondrocytic cell line Swarm rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) (35Issack P.S. Fang C.H. Leslie M.P. Di Cesare P.E. J. Orthop. Res. 2000; 18: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We have shown that COMP mRNA and protein are expressed in RCS cells, but not in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. A COMP promoter fragment containing ∼1.9 kb of 5′-flanking sequence is specifically active in RCS cells. In cell culture experiments, deletion analysis of the distal region of the COMP promoter identified a silencer region situated between –1775 and –1716 that specifically binds protein complexes expressed in non-chondrocytic cells, but not in RCS cells. Competition gel shift experiments localized the binding site to within 30 bp (–1775 to –1746; negative regulatory element (NRE)). This site is necessary and sufficient to repress COMP expression in fibroblast cell lines (35Issack P.S. Fang C.H. Leslie M.P. Di Cesare P.E. J. Orthop.

Yeast one-hybrid screening has proven to be an effective tool to identify DNA-binding proteins (40Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Frampton J. Graf T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3347-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that interact with the NRE in the promoter region of the COMP gene, we screened a yeast expression cDNA library using a tandem repeat of four NREs as bait. These experiments identified the leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF) transcriptional repressor as a binding protein at the NRE. LRF is a nuclear protein with an N-terminal POZ (poxvirus zinc finger) domain and a C-terminal Krüppel-like zinc finger DNA-binding domain (44Davies J.M. Hawe N. Kabarowski J. Huang Q.H. Zhu J. Brand N.J. Leprince D. Dhordain P. Cook M. Morriss-Kay G. Zelent A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). LRF was found to be the mouse counterpart of human FBI-1 (factor that binds to the HIV-1 inducer of short transcripts) (45Pessler F. Pendergrast P.S. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the rat osteoclast-derived zinc finger (OCZF) protein (48Kukita A. Kukita T. Ouchida M. Maeda H. Yatsuki H. Kohashi O. Blood. 1999; 94: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with identical functionally important molecular domains. Many transcription factors repress transcription by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) to chromatin. HDACs are classified into two groups based on structural and functional similarities. Class I HDACs, including HDAC1, are expressed in the nuclei of cells in most tissues (49Gao L. Cueto M.A. Asselbergs F. Atadja P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25748-25755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In this study, we discovered the transcriptional repressor LRF as a novel regulator controlling COMP gene expression and chondrogenesis and demonstrate that HDAC1 is involved in LRF-mediated gene transcription. LRF, which associates with HDAC1, is the first transcription factor found to bind directly to the COMP gene promoter and to regulate COMP gene expression and chondrogenic differentiation. Plasmid Constructs—Yeast reporter vectors (pHISi, pHISi-1, and pLacZi; Clontech) were used to generate NRE-specific reporter constructs. Briefly, a synthetic DNA oligomer containing four tandem repeats of the NRE sequence (AGCCTGGGAGAGGGTCCCTGCCCTATGGAA) was cloned into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of pHISi, pHISi-1, and pLacZi to produce pHISi-4NRE, pHISi-1-4NRE, and pLacZi-4NRE, respectively. The bacterial expression vector pGEX-3X (Invitrogen) was used to produce recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. cDNA fragments encoding a segment of LRF (amino acids (aa) 207–277) located between the POZ domain and zinc fingers motifs and two segments of HDAC1 (aa 51–452 and 51–467) were amplified by PCR and subcloned in-frame into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-3X to produce plasmids pGEX-LRF-(207–277), pGEX-HDAC1-(51–452), and pGEX-HDAC1-(51–467), respectively, which express glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in bacteria. The COMP-specific luciferase expression reporter constructs (–1925COMPluc, –1775COMPluc, and –592COMPluc) have been described previously (35Issack P.S. Fang C.H. Leslie M.P. Di Cesare P.E. J. Orthop. Res. 2000; 18: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The –Δ1925COMPluc plasmid, in which the NRE was deleted, was generated by fusion PCR. Two primers with deletion flanking sequences complementary to one another (5′-GACAGCAGGGAGAGGTTGTCCAATTGTAAGAGCCCCAGC-3′ and 5′-CTTACAATTGGACAACCTCTCCCTGCTGTCCCCTCCCTA-3′) were used in combination with end primers 5′-CGGGGTACCACTGGAGGCCTGGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-GTTGGGCCCTAAAGGGAGCTGTGGGAAAG-3′ to generate fragments on either side of the region to be deleted. The two fragments were then annealed to one another in a second PCR using the primers at each end of the sequence. The resultant fragment was digested with KpnI and ApaI and subcloned into the KpnI/ApaI sites in –1925COMPluc to generate the –Δ1925COMPluc plasmid. The 4xN-REpGL2-Promoter plasmid contains four tandem repeats of the NRE inserted upstream of the SV40 promoter. This construct was generated by subcloning PCR-amplified tandem repeats of four 30-bp sequences (–1775 to –1746) into the KpnI/XhoI sites in the polylinker of the pGL2-Promoter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The mammalian expression constructs pFLAG-LRF and pFLAG-LRFΔPOZ were kindly provided by Drs. R. L. Widom and A. Zelent (44Davies J.M. Hawe N. Kabarowski J. Huang Q.H. Zhu J. Brand N.J. Leprince D. Dhordain P. Cook M. Morriss-Kay G. Zelent A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Yeast One-hybrid Screening—A one-hybrid library screen (Clontech) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The pHISi-4NRE, pHISi-1-4NRE, and pLacZi-4NRE bait plasmids were linearized and integrated into the genome of yeast strain YM4271 by homologous recombination. The yeast strain was then transformed with a pPC86 vector-based mouse embryo day 10.5 cDNA library (Invitrogen). Approximately 2.5 × 106 yeast transformants were plated on synthetic complete medium lacking histidine and tryptophan and supplemented with 45 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Selected clones were subjected to the β-galactosidase assay using the colony lift filter method. Plasmids from putative positive clones were recovered from yeast and individually transformed into E. coli DH10B cells for amplification. To eliminate false-positive results, these plasmids were separately introduced into yeast cells containing either bait or the p53-binding site (Clontech), and transformants were tested by β-galactosidase assay. Inserts were sequenced, and the DNA sequences were used to query the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank. Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—For expressing GST fusion proteins, plasmid pGEX-LRF-(207–277), pGEX-HDAC1-(1–432), pGEX-HDAC1-(51–482), pGEX-HDAC1-(51–452), or pGEX-LRF-(51–467) was transformed into E. coli DH5α (Invitrogen). The GST fusion protein was affinity-purified on glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (50Liu C.-J. Wang H. Lengyel P.

Preparation and Characterization of Affinity-purified Anti-LRF Antibodies—The GST-LRF-(207–277) fusion protein, encoding a segment (aa 207–277) between the POZ domain and zinc finger motifs of LRF, was expressed in E. coli DH5α, purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column, and subjected to preparative scale SDS-PAGE. The major band was excised and used to immunize rabbits for polyclonal antiserum production (Zymed Custom Antibody, Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). To affinity-purify anti-LRF antibodies, the anti-GST activity in the rabbit antiserum was depleted using GST protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. The depleted serum was incubated with Affi-Gel-10 beads (Bio-Rad) to which purified GST-LRF-(207–277) was covalently linked. The bound antibodies were eluted from the beads with 0.15 m glycine buffer (pH 2.5) and immediately neutralized with 1.5 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) (55Liu C.-J. Wang H. Zhao Z. Yu S. Lu Y.B. Meyer J. Chatterjee G. Deschamps S. Roe B.A. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7024-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The affinity-purified antibodies were characterized using in vitro translated LRF in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared from C3H10T1/2 cells and RCS cell lines transfected with the pFLAG-LRF expression plasmid. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, proteinase inhibitors, and 0.3% Nonidet P-40). After 5 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pelleted nuclei were washed with lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgC12, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 25% glycerol), and NaCl was added to obtain a final concentration of 400 mm. After incubation at 4 °C for 10 min, the nuclei were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant fraction was used as the nuclear extract. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Complementary oligonucleotides for the NRE and its serial mutants (see Fig. 5A for sequences) were synthesized and annealed by heating to 70 °C for 5 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature. Probes were prepared by end labeling oligonucleotides with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The binding reaction was achieved by preincubating nuclear extracts with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)/poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer containing 20 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.9), 70 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, and 5 μmol/liter p-amidinophenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at room temperature for 20 min as described previously (51Liu C.-J. Ding B. Wang H. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Three nanograms of end-labeled probes were added to the reaction mixture containing the nuclear extract and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. For competition experiments, excess unlabeled DNA was incubated with the reaction mixture for 15 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. In supershift assays, 5 μg of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) were incubated with the reaction mixture for 15 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. The samples were subjected to 4% PAGE in 0.5% buffer (45 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA) at 15 V/cm for 3 h at room temperature. The gel was dried, and autoradiography was performed at –70 °C. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—In vivo binding of LRF to the NRE of the COMP promoter was investigated using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Confluent human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transfected with the COMP-specific reporter construct –1925COMPluc and expression plasmid pFLAG-LRF. These transformed HEK cells and murine C3H10T1/2 progenitor cells were cultured on 10-mm dishes and then treated with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) to cross-link LRF to the DNA. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)). The lysate was sonicated to shear DNA to a length between 200 and 1000 bp. The sonicated supernatant was diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), and 150 mm NaCl) and incubated with anti-FLAG antibody (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), anti-LRF or anti-HDAC1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or preimmune serum overnight at 4 °C with rotation. To collect DNA/proteins complexes, salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry was added to the mixture and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation, and the DNA/protein A-agarose was pelleted by centrifugation. After extensive washing of the pellet with a series of wash buffers, the pellet was dissolved with 250 μl of elution buffer and centrifuged to remove the agarose. The supernatant was treated with 20 μl of 5 m NaCl and heated to 65 °C for 4 h to reverse the LRF-DNA cross-link. After treatment with EDTA and proteinase K, the supernatant was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol to recover the DNA. For PCR of the COMP promoter region using the chromatin-immunoprecipitated DNA, one-tenth of the DNA was PCR-amplified using forward primer 5′-GTAGTCAATAGGCCTGGGAAGA and reverse primer 5′-GGAAAGGGAGTCAGAACTGAAG. Thirty-five cycles of PCR at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s were performed. PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gel. Reporter Gene Assay—RCS cells grown to ∼50% confluence in 35-mm culture dishes were transfected with 1 μg of reporter construct (-1925COMPluc, –1775COMPluc, –Δ1925COMPluc, –592COMPluc, or 4xNREpGL2-Promoter) along with 1 μg of pSVGal plasmid (internal control) and various amounts of pFLAG-LRF expression plasmid. To examine whether HDACs are involved in the LRF-mediated repression, various amounts of trichostatin A (TSA) (see Fig. 10C) were added to the medium. At 48 h aft"
https://openalex.org/W2054481440,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses multiple phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx)-like proteins in the absence of a classical glutathione peroxidase (cGPx), providing a unique system for dissecting the roles of these enzymes in vivo. The Gpx3 (Orp1/PHGpx3) protein transduces the hydroperoxide signal to the transcription factor Yap1, a function that could account for most GPX-dependent phenotypes. To test this hypothesis and ascertain what functions of Gpx3 can be shared by cGPx-like enzymes, we constructed a novel cGPx-like yeast enzyme, cGpx3. We confirmed that the “gap” sequences conserved among cGPxs but absent from aligned PHGPx sequences are the principal cause of the structural and functional differences of these enzymes. Peroxidase activity against a cGPx substrate was high in the cGpx3 construct, which was multimeric and had a peroxidase catalytic mechanism distinct from Gpx3; but cGpx3 was defective for phospholipid hydroperoxidase and signaling activities. cGpx3 did not complement the sensitivity to lipid peroxidation of a gpxΔ mutant, and the resistance to lipid peroxidation conferred by Gpx3 was independent of Yap1, establishing a functional role for Gpx3 phospholipid hydroperoxidase activity. Using the comparison between cGpx3 and Gpx3 in conjunction with other constructs to probe lipid peroxidation as a toxicity mechanism, we also ascertained that lipid peroxidation-dependent processes are a principal cause of cellular cadmium toxicity. The results demonstrate that phospholipid hydroperoxidase and Yap1-mediated signaling activities of Gpx3 have independent functional roles, although both functions depend on the absence of cGPx-like subunit interaction sites, and the results resolve more clearly the potential drivers of the differential selective evolution of GPx-like enzymes.

All aerobic organisms require protection from reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; GPx, glutathione peroxidase; cGPx, classical GPx; PHGPx, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase; t-BHP, tert-butyl hydroperoxide; PCOOH, phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide; 18:3, linolenic acid; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid; CRR, cyanide resistant respiration. which are generated continually as byproducts of cellular metabolism. Such protection can be especially important during exposure to stressors that may promote ROS production, such as pro-oxidants, metals, and other xenobiotics (1Dawes I.W. Dickinson J.R. Schweizer M. The Metabolism and Physiology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Taylor & Francis, London1999: 277-326Google Scholar, 2Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine,3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). Thus, organisms express an array of non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidant defense mechanisms. Peroxidases such as catalases, glutathione peroxidases (GPxs), and other thiol-dependent peroxidases are important enzymatic defense systems that reduce hydroperoxides (e.g. tert-butyl hydroperoxide, H2O2). The GPxs are commonly considered to be the most important peroxidases or ROS defense because they have broader substrate specificities and stronger affinity for H2O2 than catalases (1Dawes I.W. Dickinson J.R. Schweizer M. The Metabolism and Physiology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Taylor & Francis, London1999: 277-326Google Scholar, 3Brigelius-Flohé R. Flohé L. Biofactors. 2003; 17: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Two of the main types of GPx that have been characterized in cells are the classical GPx (cGPx) and the phospholipid hydroperoxide GPx (PHGPx). cGPx is multimeric (commonly tetrameric) and soluble, whereas PHGPx is monomeric and often membrane-associated (4Ursini F. Maiorino M. Brigelius-Flohé R. Aumann K.D. Roveri A. Schomburg D. Flohé L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Diverse functions in signaling and cellular differentiation (including spermatogenesis) have been reported for PHGPxs, but not for cGPxs (3Brigelius-Flohé R. Flohé L. Biofactors. 2003; 17: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M.B. Vinh J. Toledano M.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). In addition, whereas cGPx has specificity for glutathione as a reducing substrate, PHGPx re-reduction may be coupled to alternative systems such as the thioredoxin pathway (5Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M.B. Vinh J. Toledano M.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 6Brigelius-Flohé R. Free Radic. Biol.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 2414-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Moreover, in addition to the inorganic and organic hydroperoxides that are substrates for the enzymatic activities of both proteins, PHGPx alone reduces lipid hydroperoxides esterified to biomembranes. Thus, PHGPx is often considered the principal cellular enzyme capable of repairing membrane lipid peroxidation, the highly damaging process that has been linked to pathological conditions such as ischemic injury, atherosclerosis, and carcinogenesis (2Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine,3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). However, it has been questioned increasingly in recent years whether the phospholipid hydroperoxidase activity is the physiologically relevant function of PHGPx in vivo, or whether more diversified roles may be of greater importance (3Brigelius-Flohé R. Flohé L. Biofactors. 2003; 17: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Brigelius-Flohé R. Maiorino M. Flohé L. Cadenas E. Packer L. Handbook of Antioxidants. Marcel Dekker, New York2001: 633-664Google Scholar). PHGPx is less ubiquitous than cGPx in higher eukaryotes (9Brigelius-Flohé R. Wingler K. Müller C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is widely used for studying cellular responses to ROS, expresses three GPX genes (10Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K.-I. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) all of which were found to encode only the PHGPx-like proteins Gpx1, Gpx2, and Gpx3 (11Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The latter conclusion was based on protein sequence comparisons, analyses of the substrate specificities of the purified GPX1–3 products, and the susceptibilities to lipid peroxidation (arising from linolenic acid supplementation) of gpx3Δ and gpx1Δ/gpx2Δ/gpx3Δ S. cerevisiae mutants. Further studies have underscored the central role of GPx-like function in the antioxidant defense of yeast. It has been established that purified yeast glutaredoxins also have high GPx activity (12Collinson E.J. Wheeler G.L. Garrido E.O. Avery A.M. Avery S.V. Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16712-16717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), although this may make only a small contribution to total GPx activity in yeast under standard growth conditions (10Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K.-I. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 11Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Moreover, Delaunay et al. (5Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M.B. Vinh J. Toledano M.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) identified a novel role for yeast Gpx3 (which they term Orp1) as a sensor and transducer of the stress response to hydrogen peroxide. This occurs via Gpx3-mediated oxidation of the Yap1 transcription factor; the proposed model involves the sensing of high H2O2 concentrations at the Cys36 residue of Gpx3, which forms a disulfide-linked intermolecular complex with Cys598 in Yap1 that, after rearrangement of the disulfide bond, resolves to yield Yap1(Cys303-Cys598) and re-reduced Gpx3. Yap1 may alternatively be activated by thiol reactive chemicals via a Gpx3-independent pathway (13Azevedo D. Tacnet F. Delaunay A. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Toledano M.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It was shown that Gpx3-dependent resistance to H2O2 was due to its signaling function and not to its peroxidase activity as suggested previously (5Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M.B. Vinh J. Toledano M.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The role of the redox-transducing function in protection against phospholipid hydroperoxides was not tested in those studies. The expression of three PHGPx-like enzymes combined with the absence of a cGPx is, to our knowledge, unique to S. cerevisiae. This finding was proposed to indicate that S. cerevisiae may have been under a particular selective pressure to evolve and sustain a high capacity for the enzymatic repair of membrane lipid peroxidation specifically (11Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The alternative function(s) of Gpx3 outlined above has now raised additional possible explanations for the concentration of PHGPx-like versus cGPx-like activity in S. cerevisiae, though it has not yet been tested whether Gpx3-mediated signaling via Yap1 has the potential to be undertaken by a cGPx-like protein. Another important and related question is whether the latter activity of Gpx3 accounts entirely for Gpx3-dependent phenotypes in cells, including resistance to lipid peroxidation (5Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M.B. Vinh J. Toledano M.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 14Georgiou G. Cell. 2002; 111: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), or does the phospholipid hydroperoxidase activity of Gpx3 (and other PHGPx-like enzymes) have a functional role? To help resolve these issues and gain further insight into the role of PHGPx versus cGPx activity in cells, here we constructed a novel cGPx-like protein derived from yeast Gpx3. We confirmed the hypothesis (15Brigelius-Flohé R. Aumann K.-D. Blöcker H. Gross G. Kiess M. Klöppel K.D. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Schuckelt R. Ursini F. Wingender E. Flohé L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7342-7348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the “gap” sequences conserved among cGPx enzymes but absent from aligned PHGPx sequences distinguish these groups of enzymes structurally and functionally. The phospholipid hydroperoxide reductase and Yap1-mediated signaling activities of Gpx3 were shown to have independent functional roles, which were both lost in the cGPx-like derivative despite an elevated general (non-phospholipid) hydroperoxidase activity. Finally, the genetic uncoupling of phospholipid hydroperoxidase activity from other Gpx3 functions allowed us to show the importance of that activity in protecting cells against lipid peroxidation and also against toxicants such as cadmium for which a lipid peroxidation-dependent mode of action was established. Yeast Strains and Preparation of Yeast Cell Extracts—S. cerevisiae BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) and the derivative deletion mutants gpx1Δ and yap1Δ were obtained from Euroscarf (Frankfurt, Germany). An isogenic gpx1Δ/gpx2Δ/gpx3Δ triple mutant was constructed previously (11Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A yap1Δ/gpx3Δ double mutant in the BY4741 background was constructed by short flanking homology PCR (16Wach A. Brachat A. AlbertiSegui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar); the URA3 marker was used to disrupt GPX3 in the yap1Δ deletion strain from Euroscarf (primer sequences are available on request). A gpx1Δ/gpx2Δ/gpx3Δ (gpx1::URA3, gpx2::HIS3, gpx3::KanMX4) triple mutant derived from S. cerevisiae S150–2B (MATa his3Δ1 leu2–3,112 trp1–289 ura3-52) was constructed in this study, as outlined previously for BY4741 (11Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae YPH98 (MATa leu2-Δ1 trp1-Δ1 ura3-52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre) and the isogenic derivative gpx3Δ, in addition to the vector pRS316-HA-Gpx3C82S (5Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M.B. Vinh J. Toledano M.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by M. B. Toledano (CNRS, Gif-sur-Yvette Cedex, France). Yeast cell extracts were prepared as described previously (11Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Construction of cGpx3—Splice overextension PCR (19Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-529PubMed Google Scholar) was used to introduce the putative subunit interaction sequences (which are well conserved in cGPxs) of human cGPx1 into yeast Gpx3, using pET14b-GPX3 (11Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) as the plasmid template. To insert coding sequences for the amino acid sequence LNSLKYVRPGGGFEPN in place of AQFCQLNYGVT from Gpx3 (Fig. 1A), a ∼5.6 Kb DNA fragment was amplified using KOD DNA polymerase (Novagen) with the forward and reverse primers 5′-ATGTTAGACCAGGTGGTGGTTTTGAACCAAATTTCCCCATTATGAAAAAAATTGACG-3′ and 5′-ACCACCTGGTCTAACATATTTCAAAGAATTCAAAATTTCTTCATCAGAGCCAGGTTCTTGG-3′, respectively. Purified PCR products were digested overnight with DpnI (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C to remove all methylated DNA. Competent Escherichia coli (Top 10) was transformed directly with the digestion mix. Colony direct PCR (20Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, 2004Google Scholar) with GPX3-specific primers was used to detect appropriately modified plasmids in transformants, giving a PCR product of 514 bp versus 499 bp with the unmodified plasmid (a 100-bp ladder from New England Biolabs was used as marker). The sequence was verified by automatic DNA sequencing. Modified plasmids were then used as the template to insert coding sequences for the second amino acid sequence of interest. Here the sequence REALPAPSDDATALMTDPKLITWSPVCRNDVA was used to replace the sequence KSQKSGMLGLRGIK (Fig. 1A). The primers were 5′-GATGACTGATCCAAAATTGATTACTTGGTCTCCAGTTTGTAGAAATGATGTTGCATGGAATTTTGAAAAATTCTTAGTCGATAAAAAGGG-3′ and 5′-ATCAATTTTGGATCAGTCATCAAAGCAGTTGCATCATCAGATGGTGCTGGCAATGCTTCTCTCAAAAACTTGTAAACAGGGTCCTCATTGCC-3′. All other steps were as described above for insertion of the first sequence of interest; a 568-bp PCR product indicated the appropriately modified plasmids in this case. Gpx3p and cGpx3p Expression and Purification from Escherichia coli—The plasmids pET14b-GPX3 and pET14b-cGPX3 (see above) were used for expression of His-tagged Gpx3 and cGpx3 in E. coli BL21 (DE3; Promega), as we have described previously (11Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The His-tagged proteins were purified from E. coli cell extracts according to the manufacturer's instructions using 1-ml HiTrap chelating affinity columns (Amersham Biosciences) charged with 0.1 m NiSO4. The procedures were as described previously (11Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Fractions containing the protein peaks (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar) were assayed immediately for enzymatic activity. Soluble recombinant protein was also analyzed by SDS-PAGE after affinity purification using standard protocols (20Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, 2004Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Chromatography—Gel filtration chromatography was used to estimate the molecular masses of the native Gpx3 and cGpx3 proteins in their active states. A commercial GPx (bovine cGPx; Sigma) was also analyzed for comparison. Fractions that contained peak activities from affinity purification (above) were pooled and passed through a desalting column (5 ml; Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted with 0.02 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. The eluate (∼2 ml) was collected and applied to a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.02 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Protein was eluted at 0.5 ml min–1 and collected in 1-ml fractions. Protein concentrations in the fractions were determined (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar), and the molecular masses of the proteins were determined by comparison with standards (MW-GF-200, molecular mass range 12,000–200,000 Da; Sigma). Gpx3p and cGpx3p Expression in S. cerevisiae—GPX3 was cloned into the multicopy yeast episomal vector YEp351 using the Gateway Clonase system (Invitrogen). Briefly, a fragment comprising the GPX3 open reading frame together with 959 bp of an upstream promoter sequence was amplified from yeast genomic DNA with PCR, incorporating primer-encoded attB sites near the 5′-termini of the PCR product (primer sequences are available on request). The PCR product was cloned into the vector pDONR using the BP Clonase enzyme mix (Invitrogen) to produce an “entry” vector. Reading frame cassette B containing attR sites (Invitrogen) was ligated into the SmaI site of YEp351 to produce a “destination” vector. The GPX3 fragment was cloned from the entry vector into the destination vector using the LR Clonase enzyme mix (Invitrogen), creating YEp351-Gpx3. YEp351-cGpx3 was constructed by splice overextension PCR using exactly the same procedures as described under “Construction of cGpx3” (above) but with YEp351-cGpx3 as the plasmid template. Appropriate sequences for all modified plasmids were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Plasmids were transformed into S. cerevisiae using the lithium acetate method (21Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on yeast nitrogen base medium with appropriate supplements. Enzyme Assays—Phospholipid hydroperoxidase activity in vitro was determined spectrophotometrically according to NADPH oxidation, which is coupled with the reduction of phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide to the corresponding hydroxyphospholipid (9Brigelius-Flohé R. Wingler K. Müller C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 347: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Glutathione (GSH) was favored over thioredoxin (5Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M.B. Vinh J. Toledano M.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) as the reducing system in this study because GSH, but not thioredoxin, serves as a substrate for both PHGPx-like and cGPx-like enzymes, allowing direct comparison of activities. GSH-dependent GPx activity in yeast extracts has been reported in several studies (10Inoue Y. Matsuda T. Sugiyama K.-I. Izawa S. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27002-27009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 11Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2003; 134: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but the sensitivity of detection is relatively low, so relatively large amounts of protein are included in assays (11Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (PCOOH) was generated and purified as described previously (11Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activities in crude cell extracts or activities of purified recombinant protein, with either PCOOH or t-BHP as substrates, were assayed exactly as described previously (11Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed in S. cerevisiae cells transformed with the vector pyTRX2 (a gift from D. J. Jamieson, Heriot-Watt University) in which the lacZ structural gene is expressed under the control of the Yap1-responsive TRX2 promoter of S. cerevisiae (23Stephen D.W.S. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected in yeast nitrogen base-Leu medium and grown to exponential phase (A600 ∼ 1). β-Galactosidase activity was determined (20Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, 2004Google Scholar) before and at intervals after exposing cells to 0.4 mm H2O2. Phenotype Analyses—Organisms were cultured to mid/late-exponential phase (A600 ∼ 2) either in liquid YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) medium or, for experiments involving plasmid-bearing strains, in yeast nitrogen base medium supplemented with the appropriate amino acids or nucleic acid bases (20Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, 2004Google Scholar). For spotting experiments with H2O2 or cadmium, the cultures were adjusted to an A600 of ∼1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001 for each strain. Samples (5 μl) from each dilution were spotted on YEPD agar supplemented with H2O2 or Cd(NO3)2 as specified. For all experiments involving linolenic acid (18:3), media were prepared with Tergitol to solubilize the fatty acid, and 1-μl aliquots were spotted from dilution series starting at A600 ∼ 5. The final Tergitol concentration was 1% (w/v); Tergitol has no adverse effect on yeast growth (17Howlett N.G. Avery S.V. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2971-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth was examined after incubation for 4 days at 30 °C. The Insertion of Putative cGPx Subunit Interaction Sequences to Gpx3 Yields a cGPx-like Protein—Sequence alignments of PHGPx proteins against cGPxs produce two characteristic sequence gaps in the PHGPxs (11Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15Brigelius-Flohé R. Aumann K.-D. Blöcker H. Gross G. Kiess M. Klöppel K.D. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Schuckelt R. Ursini F. Wingender E. Flohé L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7342-7348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These gaps correspond closely to the predicted subunit interaction sites of cGPx enzymes (15Brigelius-Flohé R. Aumann K.-D. Blöcker H. Gross G. Kiess M. Klöppel K.D. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Schuckelt R. Ursini F. Wingender E. Flohé L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7342-7348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which form α-helix and loop structures that are incomplete or absent in PHGPx-like enzymes (4Ursini F. Maiorino M. Brigelius-Flohé R. Aumann K.D. Roveri A. Schomburg D. Flohé L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Consequently, it was proposed that the gaps at these sites might dictate the monomeric nature and the substrate range of PHGPxs (15Brigelius-Flohé R. Aumann K.-D. Blöcker H. Gross G. Kiess M. Klöppel K.D. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Schuckelt R. Ursini F. Wingender E. Flohé L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7342-7348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We tested this hypothesis by inserting the subunit interaction sequences from human cGPx (hGPx1) at the corresponding gap positions of Gpx3 (Fig. 1A), the principal phospholipid hydroperoxidase of S. cerevisiae (11Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The inserted sequences were codon-optimized for yeast and were the minimum fragment lengths estimated to be necessary for introducing the conserved cGPx α-helix and loop structures to Gpx3 (4Ursini F. Maiorino M. Brigelius-Flohé R. Aumann K.D. Roveri A. Schomburg D. Flohé L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Appropriate modification of the GPX3 open reading frame was confirmed with PCR and automatic DNA sequencing. Analysis of the wild type and modified proteins by denaturing PAGE, after heterologous expression in E. coli and affinity purification, confirmed that the inserted sequences were incorporated into the novel full-length protein product, which was termed cGpx3 (Fig. 1B). Size exclusion chromatography under nondenaturing conditions was used to estimate the native molecular masses of Gpx3 and cGpx3 expressed in E. coli. The purified proteins could be readily discriminated according to size under these conditions (Fig. 1C). By comparison with protein standards, the molecular masses of native Gpx3 and cGpx3 were calculated as ∼22 and ∼49 kDa, respectively. Compared with the molecular masses obtained with denaturing gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 1B), these results corresponded to a multimeric (dimeric) structure for cGpx3 in contrast to that of Gpx3, which is monomeric (11Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). All documented cGPx-like enzymes from other organisms form dimers or tetramers (4Ursini F. Maiorino M. Brigelius-Flohé R. Aumann K.D. Roveri A. Schomburg D. Flohé L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 24Styblo M. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1992; 34: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 25Nagai T. Yukimoto T. Suzuki N. Z. Naturforsch. 2002; 57: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As a positive control, we confirmed the tetrameric structure of a commercially available bovine cGPx according its molecular mass (∼80 kDa) using the same procedures as above. Initial enzymatic assays with proteins induced heterologously in E. coli revealed that purified cGpx3 had an ∼7-fold higher relative activity with a generic GPx substrate (t-BHP) than with a PHGPx-specific substrate (PCOOH) as compared with purified Gpx3 (data not shown). Moreover, the detection of strong peroxidase activity with cGpx3 was despite the replacement of Cys82, a residue essential for the peroxidase activity of Gpx3 (5Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M.B. Vinh J. Toledano M.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). This result was consistent with a peroxidase catalytic mechanism in cGpx3 similar to that of other cGpxs and distinct from Gpx3 (see “Discussion”). This finding prompted us to substantiate the above results by comparing the enzymatic activities under more native conditions, i.e. in S. cerevisiae and expressed under the control of the GPX3 promoter. Most of the analyses were with cells overexpressing Gpx3 or cGpx3 from multi-copy plasmids in order to maxim"
https://openalex.org/W2056426490,"Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) modulate G protein activity by functioning as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for α-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. RGS14 regulates G protein nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis by acting as a GAP through its RGS domain and as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) through its GoLoco motif. RGS14 exerts GDI activity on Gαi1, but not Gαo. Selective interactions are mediated by contacts between the αA and αB helices of the Gαi1 helical domain and the GoLoco C terminus (Kimple, R. J., Kimple, M. E., Betts, L., Sondek, J., and Siderovski, D. P. (2002) Nature 416, 878–881). Three isoforms of Gαi exist in mammalian cells. In this study, we tested whether all three isoforms were subject to RGS14 GDI activity. We found that RGS14 inhibits guanine nucleotide exchange on Gαi1 and Gαi3 could, but not Gαi2. Gαi2 be rendered sensitive to RGS14 GDI activity by replacement of residues within the α-helical domain. In addition to the contact residues in the αA and αB helices previously identified, we found that the αA/αB and αB/αC loops are important determinants of Gαi selectivity. The striking selectivity observed for RGS14 GDI activity in vitro points to Gαi1 and Gαi3 as the likely targets of RGS14-GoLoco regulation in vivo. Regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) modulate G protein activity by functioning as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for α-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. RGS14 regulates G protein nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis by acting as a GAP through its RGS domain and as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) through its GoLoco motif. RGS14 exerts GDI activity on Gαi1, but not Gαo. Selective interactions are mediated by contacts between the αA and αB helices of the Gαi1 helical domain and the GoLoco C terminus (Kimple, R. J., Kimple, M. E., Betts, L., Sondek, J., and Siderovski, D. P. (2002) Nature 416, 878–881). Three isoforms of Gαi exist in mammalian cells. In this study, we tested whether all three isoforms were subject to RGS14 GDI activity. We found that RGS14 inhibits guanine nucleotide exchange on Gαi1 and Gαi3 could, but not Gαi2. Gαi2 be rendered sensitive to RGS14 GDI activity by replacement of residues within the α-helical domain. In addition to the contact residues in the αA and αB helices previously identified, we found that the αA/αB and αB/αC loops are important determinants of Gαi selectivity. The striking selectivity observed for RGS14 GDI activity in vitro points to Gαi1 and Gαi3 as the likely targets of RGS14-GoLoco regulation in vivo. Signal transduction mediated by heterotrimeric G proteins is regulated by cycles of nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis. Activated receptors act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on Gα. Binding of GTP induces a conformational change in Gα, dissociating it from Gβγ and freeing both subunits to interact with effectors. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP by Gα returns the protein to its inactive conformation, which promotes its association with Gβγ subunits (1Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The rates of nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis are modulated by exogenous factors.

GAP activity is harbored in a protein domain of ∼120 amino acids that is the defining feature of a family of greater than 20 proteins in mammalian organisms (2Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 3Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar).Recently, a second protein domain has been identified that impinges upon the nucleotide regulatory cycle of Gα subunits. A conserved 19-amino acid sequence motif named Gi/o-Loco (GoLoco) or G protein-regulatory (GPR) binds to members of the Gαi family of G protein α subunits and acts as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) (4Willard F.S. Kimple R.J. Siderovski D.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 925-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). GoLoco was identified in the Drosophila RGS protein Loco as a Gαi-binding domain independent of the RGS domain (5Granderath S. Stollewerk A. Greig S. Goodman C.S. O'Kane C.J. Klambt C. Development. 1999; 126: 1781-1791PubMed Google Scholar). Homology searches revealed that similar domains were present in other proteins, including those known to regulate G protein signaling: RGS12, the mammalian ortholog of Loco, RGS14, and Rap1GAP (6Siderovski D.P. Diverse-Pierluissi M. De Vries L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 340-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 7Ponting C.P. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The GPR motif was recognized in AGS3, a protein identified in a screen for receptor-independent activators of Gβγ-dependent signaling in yeast (8Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). AGS3 contains an N-terminal half with seven tetratricopeptide repeats followed by four tandem repeats designated GPR in the C-terminal half of the protein. The human protein LGN and Drosophila protein PINS (partner of inscrutable) have similar domain architecture (4Willard F.S. Kimple R.J. Siderovski D.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 925-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 8Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

A single GoLoco/GPR motif is found in the Caenorhabditis elegans proteins GPR-1 and GPR-2 (9Colombo K. Grill S.W. Kimple R.J. Willard F.S. Siderovski D.P. Gonczy P. Science. 2003; 300: 1957-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 10Srinivasan D.G. Fisk R.M. Xu H. van den Heuvel S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1225-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Tandem GoLoco/GPR motifs are found in G18 and Pcp2 (Purkinje cell protein-2) (4Willard F.S. Kimple R.J. Siderovski D.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 925-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The physiological roles of GoLoco proteins are only beginning to emerge. Studies in model organisms reveal a role for GoLoco domain-containing proteins in the regulation of mitotic spindle organization and force generation (9Colombo K. Grill S.W. Kimple R.J. Willard F.S. Siderovski D.P. Gonczy P. Science. 2003; 300: 1957-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 10Srinivasan D.G. Fisk R.M. Xu H. van den Heuvel S.

AGS3 has recently been implicated as a regulator of prefrontal cortex function in neuroplasticity and cocaine-seeking behavior (12Bowers M.S. McFarland K. Lake R.W. Peterson Y.K. Lapish C.C. Gregory M.L. Lanier S.M. Kalivas P.W. Neuron. 2004; 42: 269-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).The targets of the GoLoco/GPR motifs are members of the Gαi family (Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, Gαo, Gαz, Gαg, and Gαt) (4Willard F.S. Kimple R.J. Siderovski D.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 925-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). GoLoco/GPR proteins display two general patterns of selectivity. Pcp-2, LGN, and Rap1GapII bind to and act as GDIs for Gαi and Gαo subunits, although in most cases activity is greatly reduced toward Gαo (13Natochin M. Gasimov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5322-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). RGS12, RGS14, and G18 are selective for Gαi and do not interact with Gαo (14Kimple R.J. De Vries L. Tronchere H. Behe C.I. Morris R.A. Gist Farquhar M. Siderovski D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29275-29281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 15Kimple R.J. Willard F.S. Hains M.D. Jones M.B. Nweke G.K. Siderovski D.P. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional crystal structure of the RGS14 GoLoco peptide (RGS14-GL) bound to Gαi1-GDP gives insight into the mechanism by which this motif regulates G protein function (16Kimple R.J. Kimple M.E. Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). RGS14-GL contains 36 amino acids corresponding to residues 496–531 of the rat sequence. The core 19-amino acid GoLoco peptide constitutes an N-terminal α-helix that inserts into the Ras-like domain of Gαi1 between the α3 helix and switch II and the conserved acidic-glutamine-arginine triad that makes direct contact with the α- and β-phosphates of GDP and is essential for GDI activity. Residues C-terminal to the arginine triad contact the α-helical domain of Gαi. These residues are not highly conserved among GoLoco proteins and are not included in the 19-amino acid consensus sequence. Contacts between the GoLoco/GPR peptide and the α-helical domain are responsible for Gα selectivity as documented by domain swapping experiments (16Kimple R.J. Kimple M.E. Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 17Natochin M. Gasimov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Gαo becomes a substrate for the GDI activity of RGS14 when its α-helical domain is replaced with that of Gαi1 (16Kimple R.J. Kimple M.E. Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).To date, there has been little biochemical evidence that Gαi isoforms exhibit differences in their interactions with effectors or regulatory molecules. Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3 are virtually undistinguishable in their ability to inhibit adenylyl cyclase types V and VI (18Taussig R. Tang W.J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or to be substrates for the GAP activity of RGS4 (19Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). This is not surprising, in that Gαi1 and Gαi3 are 94% identical in their amino acid sequence, and they are 88 and 85% identical, respectively, to Gαi2 (20Jones D. Reed R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14241-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the α-helical domains of Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3 display greater sequence divergence than the Ras-like domain, suggesting the possibility of isoform-specific interactions with this domain.In developing assays to study the effect of potential regulators of RSG14 GDI activity, we found that guanine nucleotide exchange on Gαi2 was insensitive to the presence of RGS14. This finding was unexpected based on previous reports describing Gαi2 association with the RGS14 GoLoco domain in yeast two-hybrid assays (14Kimple R.J. De Vries L. Tronchere H. Behe C.I. Morris R.A.

Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we report the Gαi isoform selectivity of RGS14 and identify new structural features that are necessary for a productive interaction between the RGS14 GoLoco domain and Gαi.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Plasmids Encoding Gα Subunits—Standard molecular biology procedures were used to construct the plasmids (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of the plasmid inserts was verified. Wild type and mutant Gαi2 proteins were expressed as fusion proteins with a hexahistidine tag at the N terminus. HisGαi2 was generated by PCR amplification of the rat cDNA (20Jones D. Reed R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14241-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using primers ML1062 and ML1043 (Table I). This yields an EcoRI (5′)-HindIII (3′) fragment with a ribosomal binding site and encodes a hexahistidine tag followed by a single alanine residue in frame with the coding sequence of Gαi2. The PCR product was inserted into pCR2.1 Topo TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and designated HisGαi2/Topo. Following digestion with EcoRI and HindIII, the Gαi2 insert was ligated into plasmid pQE60 (Qiagen) digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was designated HisGαi2/pQE60.Table IPCR and mutagenic oligonucleotide primersPrimerSequenceaBoldface and underlined characters denote mutations made in Gαi2 sequence to generate Gαi1 residue.ML1062 (Gαi2 Fwd)5′-GAATTCATTAAAGAGGAGAAATTAACCATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGCCATGGGCTGCACCGTGAGCGCC-3′ML1043 (Gαi2 Rev)5′-CCCCCCAAGCTTTCAGAAGAGGCCACAGTC-3′ML1106 (Gαi2/Gαi1 C1 Rev)5′-ACGAGCAGCGTCTCCAAAGTCGATTTTCAATCTCCCCATGGCTCTAATGATGGCAATGATAGACTGGATGGTGTT-3′ML1107 (Gαi1/Gαi2 C1 Fwd)5′-ATCATTGCCATCATTAGAGCCATGGGGAGATTGAAAATCGACTTTGGAGACGCTGCTCGTGCGGATGATGCCAGG-3′ML1026 (Gαi2 S111A Fwd)5′-CTGTTCGCACTGGCCTGTGCTGCCGAG-3′ML1027 (Gαi2 S111A Rev)5′-CTCGGCAGCACAGGCCAGTGCGAACAG-3′ML1177 (Gαi2 M82I/V85I Fwd)5′-GCAACACCATCCAGTCTATCATAGCCATCATCAAAGCCATGGGC-3′ML1178 (Gαi2 M82I/V85I Rev)5′-GCCCATGGCTTTGATGATGGCTATGATAGACTGGATGGTGTTGC-3′ML1072 (Gαi2 S111A/C112G ΔQ117 Fwd)5′-GCTGTTCGCACTGGCCGGTGCTGCCGAGGAGGGCATGCTTCCG-3′ML1073 (Gαi2 S111A/C112G ΔQ117 Rev)5′-CGGAAGCATGCCCTCCTCGGCAGCACCGGCCAGTGCGAACAGC-3′ML1083 (Gαi2 P120T/E121A Fwd)5′-GCCGAGGAGGGCATGCTTACGGCAGACCTGTCGGGC-3′ML1084 (Gαi2 P120T/E121A Rev)5′-GCCCGACAGGTCTGCCGTAAGCATGCCCTCCTCGGC-3′ML11 (Gαi1 Sense Linker)5′-AATTCTAAGGAGGTTTAACCATGGCACATCACCATCACCATCACGC-3′ML12 (Gαi1 Antisense Linker)5′-CATGGCGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTGCCATGGTTAAACCTCCTTAG-3′a Boldface and underlined characters denote mutations made in Gαi2 sequence to generate Gαi1 residue. Open table in a new tab To generate the triple mutant HisGαi2 (M82I/V85I/S111A), HisGαi2/Topo was used as a template with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). In an initial round of mutagenesis, primers ML1026 and ML1027 were used to generate HisGαi2 (S111A)/Topo. The HisGαi2 (S111A)/Topo template was subjected to a second round of mutagenesis using primers ML1177 and Ml1178 to create HisGαi2 (M82I/V85I/S111A).The Gαi2 cluster 1 (C1) mutant in which amino acids 80–100 of Gαi2 are replaced by those of Gαi1 was generated using an overlapping PCR strategy. HisGαi2/Topo was used as a template for primers ML1062 and ML1106 to generate an N-terminal Gαi fragment. Primers ML1107 and ML1043 were used to generate a C-terminal Gαi fragment. The resultant products were used in an overlapping PCR with primers ML1062 and ML1043. The final product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into pQE60 digested with the same enzymes, producing HisGαi2(C1)/pQE60.The Gαi2 cluster 2 (C2) mutant contains the following amino acid changes: S111A, C112G, ΔQ117, P120T, and E121A. The HisGαi2(S111A)/Topo template was subjected to mutagenesis using primers ML1072 and ML1073 to add the C112G substitution and delete the codon for Gln117. The final replacements, Pro120 → Thr and Glu121 → Ala, were introduced using primers ML1083 and ML1084 in a third cycle of mutagenesis. HisGαi2(C2)/Topo was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into pQE60, generating HisGαi2(C2)/pQE60.The Gαi2(C1/C2) mutant was generated using Gαi2(C2)/Topo as a template in an overlapping PCR. Primers ML1062 and ML1106 were used to amplify an N-terminal fragment; primers ML1107 and ML1043 were used to generate a C-terminal fragment. The products were used in an overlapping PCR with primers ML1062 and ML1043. This final product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII, ligated into pQE60 digested with the same enzymes, and designated HisGαi2(C1/C2)/pQE60.HisGαi1 was generated by inserting a double-stranded oligonucleotide linker (ML11 and ML12) into Gαi1/NpT7-5 (23Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 264: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) digested with EcoRI and NcoI. This creates an N-terminal fusion with the sequence Met-Ala-His6-Ala- in frame with the first methionine of the rat Gαi1 sequence (20Jones D. Reed R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14241-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The internal NcoI site 260 nucleotides from the beginning of the coding sequence in the Gαi1/NpT7-5 template was removed by silent mutagenesis.Protein Purification—Plasmid DNA containing mouse RGS14 fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) was kindly provided by J. de Gunzburg (Paris, France) (24Traver S.

Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) harboring MBP-RGS14 was grown to an A600 of 0.5 and induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Calbiochem). After 3 h, cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation, flash frozen, and stored at –80 °C. Cell pellets were suspended in TENB (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and disrupted using a French pressure cell at 1000 p.s.i. Unbroken cells and particulate matter were removed by centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant fraction was diluted 5-fold in TENB and applied to amylose resin (New England Biolabs) equilibrated in TENB. Unbound protein was removed by washing with 10 column volumes of TENB. Bound protein was eluted with 10 mm maltose in TENB. Fractions containing MBP-RGS14 were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in TED (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). Dialyzed protein was applied to Q-Sepharose Fast Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear salt gradient (0–0.5 m NaCl in TED). Purified MBP-RGS14 was concentrated and buffer-exchanged into 50 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, using an Amicon pressure cell apparatus (Millipore Corp.), and stored at –80 °C.His-tagged Gαi subunits were purified as described by Lee et al. (25Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 237: 146-164Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) harboring Gαi were grown to an A600 of 0.4 and induced with 30 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and in the presence of 1 μg/ml chloramphenicol for ∼16 h. Cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation and frozen at –80 °C. Cell pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol) and lysed using a French pressure cell at 1000 p.s.i. Unbroken cells and particulate matter were removed by high speed (100,000 × g) centrifugation for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol). The column was washed with 50 column volumes of buffer B (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol), and Gαi subunits were eluted using a linear gradient of imidazole (10–200 mm) in buffer A. Fractions containing Gαi were pooled and desalted into Q buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) using an Amicon 50 pressure cell. Protein was applied to Resource Q resin (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear salt gradient (0–500 mm NaCl in Q buffer). Purified Gαi was concentrated and buffer-exchanged into 50 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol using an Amicon pressure cell apparatus and stored at –80 °C.N-Myristoylated Gα subunits were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) by the coexpression of Gα and yeast N-myristoyltransferase and purified as described (26Mumby S.M. Linder M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). All G protein α-subunits were purified to near homogeneity and exhibited a stoichiometry of [35S]GTPγS binding ranging from 0.4 to 0.9. No differences were observed between N-myristoylated Gα subunits and their His-tagged counterparts in assays measuring RGS14 GDI activity. 2V. Mittal, unpublished observations.GTPγS Binding Assays—Gα subunits were diluted (100 nm final concentration) into buffer containing 50 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% C12E10, 10 mm MgSO4, and 2 μm [35S]GTPγS (2500 cpm/pmol). Gαi subunits were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min; Gαo subunits were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. At the end of the incubation period, 50-μl aliquots of proteins were removed (in triplicate), and reactions were stopped with ice-cold wash buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2). Reactions were applied to BA85 nitrocellulose filters (Midwest Scientific) and washed with ice-cold wash buffer. Bound radioactive nucleotide was measured by liquid scintillation counting. To monitor GDI activity, assays were performed as above except that purified MBP-RGS14 was added to Gα subunits on ice prior to dilution into the binding mixture. In Figs. 1B and 4B, where RGS14 concentration was varied, reactions were supplemented with bovine serum albumin to maintain a constant protein concentration.Fig. 4Substitution of Gαi1 residues in both cluster 1 and cluster 2 in Gαi2 is required to restore sensitivity to RGS14 GDI activity. A, [35S]GTPγS binding in the absence (black bars) or presence (gray bars) of RGS14 (1 μm) was assessed as in Fig. 1A. B, RGS14 elicits a dose-dependent response on Gαi2 (C1/C2). HisGαi1 (circles), HisGαi2 (C1) (triangles), and HisGαi2 (C1/C2) (squares) were incubated with increasing amounts of RGS14 as in Fig. 1B. Plots shown are representative of at least three independent experiments for HisGαi1 and HisGαi1 (C1/C2) and two independent experiments in the case of HisGαi2 (C1).

After protein induction, bacteria were pelleted and suspended in 50 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% C12E10 supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma). Following a 30-min incubation on ice, suspensions were passed through a 25-gauge needle six times. Soluble and particulate fractions were separated by high speed (200,000 × g) centrifugation. Active Gαi in the lysate was quantitated by [35S]GTPγS binding. Sensitivity to the GDI activity of RGS14 was assayed as described above using a 10-fold molar excess of RGS14.GAP Assays—Gα protein was diluted (200 nm final concentration) into buffer containing 50 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% C12E10, 1 μm [γ-32P]GTP (10,000 cpm/pmol) to load the G protein with radiolabeled nucleotide. Gαo was incubated for 20 min at 25 °C, Gαi2 was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, and Gαi3 was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. To initiate GTP hydrolysis, one-tenth volume of 150 mm MgSO4 and 1.5 mm GTP (unlabeled)-containing buffer, RGS4 (100 nm, final concentration), or MBP-RGS14 (200 nm, final concentration) was added to the Gα mix on ice. Single aliquots (50 μl) were removed at the indicated times, and the reactions were quenched in 750 μl of ice-cold activated charcoal. Quenched reactions were centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 rpm in a Beckman GS-15R tabletop centrifuge. Released [32P]Pi was measured by liquid scintillation counting.

In the first instance, the coordinates of the human Gαi2 were extracted from the crystal structure of Gαi1-GDP bound to the RGS14-GL peptide (Protein Data Bank code 1KJY) (16Kimple R.J. Kimple M.E. Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) using chain A. In the second example, a model of Gαi2-GDP was made using the coordinates of rat Gαi1-GDP (Protein Data Bank code 1BOF) (30Coleman D.E. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14376-14385Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In both cases, this generates a model with an root mean square value of 0.10 Å, due to the relatively high global homology between these two proteins.Gαi2-GoLoco Complex Modeling—Protein Data Bank files for the two models of Gαi2 and either Gαi1-GDP or Gαi1-RGS14-GL were combined using the Swiss PDB viewer (DeepView) (27Schwede T.

Features of the model are described under “Discussion.”RESULTSRGS14 Selectively Inhibits Nucleotide Exchange on Gαi Isoforms—To test whether RGS14 is a GDI for all Gαi isoforms, we assayed whether RGS14 could suppress the rate of GDP dissociation from Gαi1, Gαi2, or Gαi3. The rate of binding of [35S]GTPγS is an indirect measure of GDP dissociation, which in the absence of activated receptor is the rate-limiting step in the G protein cycle (31Ferguson K.M. Higashijima T. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7393-7399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confirming previous studies (14Kimple R.J. De Vries L. Tronchere H. Behe C.I.

However, Gαi2 was resistant to the GDI activity of RGS14 (Fig. 1A). RGS14 inhibition of nucleotide exchange on Gαi1 was dose-dependent, with an IC50 of ∼75 nm (Fig. 1B), similar to published values (14Kimple R.J. De Vries L. Tronchere H. Behe C.I. Morris R.A.

Inhibition was not time-dependent and extended throughout the exchange reaction, decreasing the rate of nucleotide exchange more than 90% (Fig. 1C).RGS14 is a GAP for Gαi2—The unexpected selectivity of RGS14 GDI activity for Gαi1 and Gαi3 prompted us to determine whether the RGS domain was selective for certain Gαi isoforms. The RGS domain of RGS14 is known to be a GAP for both Gαo and Gαi1 (24Traver S. Bidot C. Spassky N. Baltauss T. de Tand M.-F. Thomas J.-L. Zalc B. Janoueix-Lerosey I. de Gunzburg J. Biochem.

We measured the ability of RGS14 to accelerate GTP hydrolysis by recombinant Gαi2 in a single-turnover GAP assay. In agreement with other reports (24Traver S. Bidot C. Spassky N.

https://openalex.org/W2081823691,"The human mda-7/IL-24 gene product is normally expressed in melanocytes and certain lymphocyte populations. Loss of expression, a distinctive feature of many tumor suppressor genes, has been documented at RNA and protein levels in association with melanoma progression both in vitro as well as in human tumor-derived material. The MDA-7/IL-24 protein undergoes post-translational processing, including removal of an amino-terminal 48-residue signal peptide and extensive glycosylation prior to its secretion by producing cells. Its inherent cytokine properties have been documented in multiple reports, which have identified and characterized its cognate receptors and activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway following ligand/receptor docking. A notable and incompletely understood property of MDA-7/IL-24 is its ability to induce apoptosis in transformed cells, while having marginal growth suppressive effects on normal primary or immortalized cell lines. MDA-7/IL-24 has been delivered to cells, tumor xenografts and patients in clinical trials via a nonreplicating adenovirus (Ad.mda-7). Studies utilizing eukaryotically expressed and purified MDA-7/IL-24 protein from several sources have recapitulated some of the molecule's reported properties including receptor binding and JAK/STAT activation. Here, we report the properties and characteristics of a bacterially expressed and purified GST-MDA-7 fusion protein. These studies reveal that GST-MDA-7 retains its cancer-selective apoptosis-inducing properties, thereby providing a new reagent that will assist in defining the mechanism of action of this novel cytokine. In addition, retention of tumor-specific activity of GST-MDA-7 suggests that this protein may also have therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2041270909,"GTP is essential for eukaryotic translation termination, where the release factor 3 (eRF3) complexed with eRF1 is involved as the guanine nucleotide-binding protein. In addition, eRF3 regulates the termination-coupled events, eRF3 interacts with poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1) and the surveillance factor Upf1 to mediate normal and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. However, the roles of GTP binding to eRF3 in these processes remain largely unknown. Here, we showed in yeast that GTP is essentially required for the association of eRF3 with eRF1, but not with Pab1 and Upf1. A mutation in the GTP-binding motifs of eRF3 impairs the eRF1-binding ability without altering the Pab1- or Upf1-binding activity. Interestingly, the mutation causes not only a defect in translation termination but also delay of normal and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, suggesting that GTP/eRF3-dependent termination exerts its influence on the subsequent mRNA degradation. The termination reaction itself is not sufficient, but eRF3 is essential for triggering mRNA decay. Thus, eRF3 is a key mediator that transduces termination signal to mRNA decay."
https://openalex.org/W2003808022,"Survivin is a unique member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, and its expression is regulated by p53. Recent identification of several functionally divergent survivin variants augments the complexity of survivin action as well as its regulation. Here we report that survivin-2B (retaining a part of intron 2 as a cryptic exon) is positively regulated by p53, and its overexpression plays a role in sensitizing leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Doxorubicin treatment activated p53, downregulated survivin and survivin-DeltaEx3 but upregulated survivin-2B in EU-3, an acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cell line with wild-type (wt)-p53 phenotype. In contrast, doxorubicin treatment failed to induce these alterations in EU-6 cells, a mutant-p53 ALL cell line. To specify the role of wt-p53 in regulating survivin and its variants, a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant plasmid p53-143 was transfected into EU-4, a p53-null ALL cell line, to establish a subline EU-4/p53-143. When EU-4/p53-143 cell culture was shifted from 37.5 degrees C to the wt-p53-permissive temperature (32.5 degrees C), the expression of survivin and survivin-DeltaEx3 was decreased whereas survivin-2B expression was increased, confirming the distinct regulatory effect of p53 on survivin and its variants. To clarify the role of survivin-2B in the process of apoptosis, survivin-2B cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3HA vector and transfected into EU-4 cells. Enforced expression of survivin-2B in EU-4 cells inhibited cell growth and sensitized these cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that survivin-2B variant is a proapoptotic factor and its expression is upregulated by p53."

Most mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome and synthesized as precursor proteins in the cytosol. Precursors to most matrix proteins and some proteins in the inner membrane possess a cleavable N-terminal presequence, which functions as a mitochondrial targeting signal and is cleaved by a matrix-processing peptidase in the matrix. Protein import into mitochondria is mediated by the translocator complex in the outer membrane, the TOM (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane) complex, and the complexes in the inner membrane, the TIM23 and TIM22 complexes (1Herrmann J.M.

Accumulated evidence suggests that the TOM complex contains multiple binding sites for mitochondrial precursor proteins on both the cytosolic and the IMS sides of the outer membrane. In particular, the binding sites for mitochondrial presequences on the cytosolic side and the IMS side are called the “cis site” and the “trans site,” respectively (5Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R.

Indeed, the expressed and purified cytosolic fragments of Tom20 and Tom22 exhibit binding abilities to mitochondrial presequences as well as to precursor proteins. On the other hand, although the negatively charged cytosolic part of Tom5 may well interact with positively charged presequences downstream of Tom20 and Tom22 along the import pathway, a recent report showed that this part is dispensable for the normal cell growth of yeast cells (17Horie C. Suzuki H. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41462-42471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial presequence recognized by the cis site of the TOM complex is subsequently guided to the TOM channel, which is mainly composed of Tom40 for translocation across the outer membrane. The TOM complex also contains the trans site, a binding site for mitochondrial presequences on the IMS side. The trans site consists of or is close to the IMS-facing region of Tom40 and Tom22 (6Rapaport D. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol.

The trans site functions as a second receptor for mitochondrial presequences located downstream of the cis site to enhance the specificity and fidelity of the mitochondrial targeting signal recognition. The trans site may also be important for efficient transfer of the presequence from the TOM complex to the presequence binding site in the TIM complex (8Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Nakai M. Shin I.

Precursor binding to the cis and trans sites of the TOM complex can be characterized by analyses of the translocation intermediates accumulated at the TOM complex. To generate such translocation intermediates, the translocation of precursor proteins across the inner membrane is blocked by dissipation of the membrane potential across the inner membrane (Δψ), which is essential for the presequence passage across the inner membrane. When pSD-(1–69), a fusion protein consisting of the 69-residue presequence of subunit 9 of the Fo-ATPase (pSu9) and mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), is incubated with de-energized mitochondria without Δψ, the fusion protein is accumulated at two distinct stages, stages A and B, depending on the folding state of the mature DHFR domain (Fig. 1) (8Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Nakai M. Shin I. Schultz P.G. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3634-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because the DHFR domain is more labile at higher temperatures, the mature DHFR domain undergoes transient unfolding, and the unfolded form is trapped by the Tom40 channel, which has a chaperone-like function (20Esaki M. Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Shin I. Schultz P.G. Endo T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), at 30 °C. At this point, the presequence has already passed the Tom40 channel to reach and bind to the trans site of the TOM complex (stage B). On the other hand, at 0 °C the mature DHFR domain is tightly folded and cannot enter the Tom40 channel. However, the 69-residue presequence of pSu9 is long enough to cross the outer membrane, and its N-terminal part reaches and binds to the trans site of the TOM complex (stage A). In the present study, we tested to find out whether fusion proteins with a presequence that is too short to reach the trans site could form cis site intermediates when incubated with de-energized (–Δψ) mitochondria. Obtained results showed that the presequence binding to the cis site of the TOM complex alone is not strong enough to generate stable cis site intermediates. We also tried to characterize the components that constitute the trans site. The TOM subunit that had been shown previously to be cross-linked to the trans site intermediates was thus identified as Tom7. We found that Tom7 and the C-terminal IMS domain of Tom22 (Tom22C) share overlapping functions at the trans site for the presequence binding and/or transfer of the presequence from the trans site to the TIM23 complex. Plasmids and Yeast Strains—The DNA for the fusion proteins (pSD) between various lengths of pSu9 and DHFR were constructed as follows. The DNA fragments for the first 38, 48, 58, 63, 78, 85, or 93 amino acid residues of pSu9 were amplified by PCR and replaced with the fragment for the first 69 amino acid residues of pSu9-(1–69)-DHFR (8Kanamori T.

The transformant was grown on a plate containing 1 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid, and the cells containing the TOM22Δ120–152 gene, but not the authentic TOM22 gene in the genome (strain Δtom22C), were selected. The TOM7 gene in strain Δtom22C was replaced with the HIS3 gene of Candida glabrata to yield the mutant strain Δtom22C/Δtom7. A DNA fragment for Tom7 with the C-terminally tagged influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope YPYDVPDYA and its upstream noncoding region of 580 bp was amplified by PCR and introduced into the KpnI-SacI site of pYO324 (26Qadota H.

The samples were halved, and one aliquot was treated with 100 μg/ml proteinase K on ice for 30 min. After the addition of 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, the mitochondria were isolated by centrifugation, and the proteins in the supernatant fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid.

The resin was isolated by centrifugation and washed once with the same buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 300 mm instead of 30 mm imidazole. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and radioimaging for detection of the radiolabeled proteins or by immunoblotting for dTom20. Miscellaneous—Photo-cross-linking experiments with pSD-(1–69) bearing dl-2-amino-5-p-benzoylpentanoic acid (BPA) were performed as described previously (8Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Nakai M. Shin I. Schultz P.G. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3634-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE) was performed by the method described previously (28Dekker P.J.T. Martin F. Maarse A.C. Bomer U. Muller H. Guiard B. Meijer M. Rassow J. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5408-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) The N-terminal 14 Residues of the Su9 Presequence Are Required for Generating the Stage A Intermediate—Translocation of mitochondrial precursor proteins across the outer membrane is guided by the transfer of their presequences from the cis site to the trans site of the TOM complex. We first asked what element in the presequence is required for the presequence binding to the cis and/or trans sites. We thus used derivatives of the model mitochondrial precursor protein pSD-(1–69). Fig. 2A shows the comparison of the in vitro import into mitochondria of pSD-(15–69), the pSD fusion protein lacking the first 14 residues in the presequence, with that of pSD-(1–69), which has the full-length presequence. Although pSD-(15–69) was imported into mitochondria, the import rate was significantly reduced as compared with that of pSD-(1–69). This is not due to the difference in the amounts of soluble import-competent forms (29Asai T. Tkahashi T. Esaki M. Nishikawa S. Ohtsuka K. Nakai M. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19464-19470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) between pSD-(1–69) and pSD-(15–69), because both proteins lose import competence during prolonged incubation in import buffer in a similar manner (data not shown). We then analyzed the binding of pSD-(15–85) and pSD-(1–85) to mitochondria in the absence of Δψ (Fig. 2B). Here we used pSD-(15–85) instead of pSD-(15–69) to make sure that the presequence-containing segment that precedes the DHFR domain is long enough to reach the trans site (30Gaume B. Klaus C. Ungermann C. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6497-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When incubated with mitochondria with dissipated Δψ at 30 °C, both pSD-(15–85) and pSD-(1–85) bound to mitochondria but were sensitive to digestion with protease added outside the mitochondria, suggesting that the DHFR domain was unfolded upon binding to the mitochondria (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 7). This finding indicates that deletion of the N-terminal 14 residues does not affect generation of the stage B intermediate. In contrast, when incubated with mitochondria without Δψ at 0 °C, although pSD-(1–85) bound to mitochondria (33.9%; Fig. 2B, lane 2) as efficiently as at 30 °C (50.9%; Fig. 2B, lane 5), the binding of pSD-(15–85) (7%; Fig. 2B, lane 2) was significantly suppressed as compared with that at 30 °C (37.4%; Fig. 2B, lane 5). The bound pSD-(1–85) contained the protease-resistant or tightly folded DHFR domain, indicating formation of the stage A intermediate (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 4). The N-terminal 14 residues are therefore essential for generating the stage A intermediate through interactions of the presequence with the trans site of the TOM complex. The cis Site-bound Form Is Not Stable in in Organello Experiments—We next tried to identify the region in the presequence that is essential for cis site binding to isolated mitochondria. Because the presequence of pSD-(1–69) is long enough to span the outer membrane (30Gaume B. Klaus C. Ungermann C. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6497-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and allows transfer of the presequence from the cis site to the trans site, only the trans site intermediate, but not the cis site intermediate, is accumulated upon incubation with de-energized mitochondria (8Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Nakai M. Shin I. Schultz P.G. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3634-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We thus made the fusion protein pSD-(1–38), with a 38-residue presequence that is too short to reach the trans site, for analyzing its possible cis site binding to de-energized mitochondria. Prior to the binding experiments, the import of pSD-(1–38) into mitochondria was compared with that of pSD-(1–69) (Fig. 2A). Although the import rate was much smaller for pSD-(1–38) than for pSD-(1–69), pSD-(1–38) was substantially imported into mitochondria. When incubated with mitochondria with dissipated Δψ at 30 °C, pSD-(1–38) bound to mitochondria (36.4%; Fig. 2B, lane 5). The DHFR domain was sensitive to externally added protease, suggesting that the DHFR domain is unfolded and, like the stage B intermediate, is likely trapped by the Tom40 channel (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 7). On the other hand, when incubated at 0 °C, pSD-(1–38) nearly failed to bind to de-energized mitochondria (2.6%; Fig. 2B, lane 2). We tested the ability of pSD-(1–38) to bind directly to the cytosolic domain of rat Tom20 (dTom20), the receptor subunit of the TOM complex that is supposed to form the cis site. The results show that pSD-(1–38) bound to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin only after preincubation with the cytosolic domain of Tom20 with C-terminally tagged hexahistidine and was eluted specifically with imidazole (Fig. 2C). Because the binding of pSD-(1–38) to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin strictly depended on the presence of Tom20 (Fig. 2C), and DHFR alone cannot bind to Tom20 (data not shown), the presequence of pSD-(1–38) possesses the binding region for the isolated Tom20 domain. The efficiency of pSD-(1–38) binding to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-bound Tom20 (∼50%) is not significantly reduced as compared with those of pSD-(1–58) and pSD-(1–63). Therefore, although pSD-(1–38) binds to purified dTom20, it does not bind to Tom20 in intact mitochondria under the present experimental conditions. pSD-(15–38) did not bind to mitochondria at 0 °C (1.2%; Fig. 2B, lane 2), but it still did at 30 °C (8.1%; Fig. 2B, lane 5), indicating a less important role of the presequence in the stage B binding than in the stage A binding. To reveal the dependence of the formation of surface-bound intermediates on the lengths of the presequences of the pSD-(1–69) derivatives in more detail, we made a series of fusion proteins (pSD-(1-x)) containing the N-terminal 38, 48, 58, 63, 69, 78, 85, and 93 residues of the pSu9 presequence and DHFR (pSD-(1–38), pSD-(1–48), pSD-(1–58), pSD-(1–63), pSD-(1–69), pSD-(1–78), pSD-(1–85), and pSD-(1–93)) together with another series of fusion proteins (pSD-(15-x)) containing the segments starting from residue 15 to residue 38, 48, 58, 69, 78, or 85 and DHFR (pSD-(15–38), pSD-(15–48), pSD-(15–58), pSD-(15–69), pSD-(15–78), and pSD-(1–85)). We analyzed the binding of these fusion proteins to de-energized mitochondria at 0 and 30 °C (Fig. 3, A and B). Although all pSD-(1-x) bound to de-energized mitochondria efficiently at 30 °C irrespective of “x,” pSD-(1-x) of x ≥ 63, but not pSD-(1-x) of x ≤ 58, bound to mitochondria at 0 °C (Fig. 3A). In the presence of MTX, a ligand for the DHFR domain, the DHFR domain of pSD-(1-x) is expected to fold tightly even at 30 °C. We thus tested the binding of pSD-(1-x) (x = 48, 69, and 85) to de-energized mitochondria at 30 °C in the presence of MTX and found that pSD-(1–48) did not bind to mitochondria, whereas pSD-(1–69) and pSD-(1–85) bound to the mitochondria efficiently (Fig. 3C). At 30 °C, the DHFR part may well become transiently unfolded so that the unfolded DHFR domain can be trapped by the Tom40 channel (20Esaki M. Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Shin I. Schultz P.G. Endo T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) irrespective of the length of the presequence, thereby yielding efficient binding to the mitochondrial surface. On the other hand, at 0 °C or in the presence of MTX, although the presequences of ≥63 residues can reach to and bind to the trans site and yield the stage A intermediate, presequences of ≤58 residues are too short to reach the trans site without the unfolding of the DHFR domain, and the folded DHFR domain cannot interact with the Tom40 channel either. Therefore, in the absence of stable presequence binding to the trans site of the TOM complex, the folded fusion proteins cannot associate with the TOM complex any more. In other words, the presequence binding to the cis site of the TOM complex alone is not strong enough to tether the fusion proteins to the mitochondrial surface. In the cases of pSD-(15-x), because the presequences lack the binding site for the trans site, the fusion proteins cannot bind to the mitochondrial surface unless the DHFR domain is unfolded and trapped by the Tom40 channel at 30 °C (Fig. 3B). Tom7 Is Close to the trans Site for Presequence Binding—Next, we asked the question of what is the requirement of the TOM complex for efficient stage A binding and stage B binding of mitochondrial precursor proteins. To address this question, we re-analyzed the TOM components located in the proximity of stage A and stage B intermediates by photo-cross-linking. Previous studies suggested that the IMS side of Tom40 and the IMS domain of Tom22 (Tom22C) likely constitute or are close to the trans site (8Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Nakai M. Shin I. Schultz P.G. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3634-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, deletion of Tom22C only mildly affects the cell growth and the in vitro import of mitochondrial proteins (18Court S.A. Nargang F. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Moczko M. Bömer U. Kübrich M. Zudall N. Hönlinger A. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6574-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Yamamoto H. Esaki M. Kanamori T. Tamura Y. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Cell. 2002; 111: 519-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This suggests that the deletion of Tom22C is compensated by the presence of the unknown component that shares the common functions with Tom22C. Indeed, in the site-specific photo-cross-linking experiments, the presequence of pSD-(1–69) that accumulated at both stage A and stage B was cross-linked to Tom40, Tom22C, and an as yet unidentified small protein X with a molecular mass of ∼5 kDa (8Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Nakai M. Shin I. Schultz P.G. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3634-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A, lane 2). Because protein X could be one of the three small Tom proteins, Tom5, Tom6, or Tom7, we performed cross-linking experiments by using mitochondria isolated from the strains Δtom5, Δtom6, or Δtom7 with a single deletion of the Tom5, Tom6, or Tom7 gene, respectively (Fig. 4A). pSu9-(1–69), which carried BPA (an unnatural amino acid with a photoactive benzophenone side chain) at position 18, was incubated with wild-type (WT), Δtom5, Δtom6, and Δtom7 mitochondria at 30 °C in the absence of Δψ and subjected to UV light irradiation. The stage B intermediates formed with WT, Δtom5, and Δtom6 mitochondria were cross-linked to protein X to generate a 34-kDa product upon UV light irradiation, whereas that formed with Δtom7 mitochondria was not cross-linked to protein X. To rule out the possibility that the deletion of Tom7 indirectly affected the cross-linking patterns, we made a yeast strain that expressed Tom7 with C-terminally tagged HA (Tom7-HA) instead of wild-type Tom7. Tom7-HA is fully functional because the growth of the strain with the deletion of both Tom7 and Tom22C but with the expression of Tom7-HA was similar to that of the strain with the deletion of Tom22C alone (data not shown). When incubated with mitochondria with Tom7-HA, BPA at residues 15 and 18 generated a cross-linked product with X, which was slightly larger than those with WT mitochondria (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 11). The cross-linked product was immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody (Fig. 4B, lanes 6 and 12). Similar results were obtained for BPA at residues 6, 8, and 14 of pSD-(1–69) (data not shown). These results indicate that protein X is Tom7 and that Tom7 is close to or constitutes the trans site of the TOM complex. Tom7 and Tom22C Have Overlapping Functions to Facilitate Protein Translocation—To probe the role of Tom7 and Tom22C around the trans site in mediating the protein import, we constructed mutant strains in which Tom7 and/or Tom22C were deleted. The strain with deleted Tom22C (Δtom22C) and the strain with deleted Tom7 (Δtom7) grew, like the WT strain, on both fermentable and non-fermentable carbon sources at 23, 30, and 37 °C (Fig. 5). On the other hand, the strain with the deletion of both Tom22C and Tom7 (Δtom22C/Δtom7) could grow only on fermentable media at low temperatures (23 and 30 °C), and could not grow on a fermentable source at high temperatures (37 °C) or on a non-fermentable source even at a low temperature (23 °C) (Fig. 5). The respiratory defect of the double deleted strain (Δtom22C/Δtom7) was not due to loss of the mitochondrial DNA (data not shown). The synthetic defects due to deletion of Tom7 and Tom22C suggest their overlapping functions. We next tested the effects of the double deletion of Tom7 and Tom22C on mitochondrial protein import in vivo. Total cell extracts were prepared from wild-type, Δtom7, Δtom22C, and Δtom22C/Δtom7 cells and were subjected to analyses by immunoblotting for various mitochondrial proteins (Fig. 6). The amounts of the subunits of the TOM complex, Tom40, Tom70, and Tom20 (Fig. 6A), and those of the TIM23 and TIM22 complexes, Tim50, Tim23, and Tim22 (Fig. 6B), were not significantly affected by the deletion of Tom7 and/or Tom22C (Fig. 6B). The band of Tom22 that lacked the C-terminal IMS domain was fainter than those of full-length Tom22, probably because the anti-Tom22 antibodies used here partly recognize its IMS domain. The precursor forms of the mitochondrial matrix proteins, Mdj1p, Ssc1p, mtHsp60, and Yge1p, were observed for the double deletion strain, Δtom22C/Δtom7, but not for the single deletion strains Δtom22C and Δtom7 and the WT stain (Fig. 6C). The amounts of the inner membrane protein PiC (phosphate carrier), as well as the peripheral inner membrane protein on the matrix side, pCox4p, also decreased in Δtom22C/Δtom7 cells. Interestingly, the amount of the outer membrane protein, porin, moderately decreased in Δtom22C cells and more significantly decreased in Δtom22C/Δtom7 cells. These results indicate that Tom7 and Tom22C facilitate mitochondrial protein import in vivo. Tom22C Is Important for Stabilization of the 440-kDa TOM Complex—Although we revealed that Tom7 and Tom22C are close to or constitute the trans site of the TOM complex and that they mediate mitochondrial protein import in vivo, their roles in mitochondrial protein import may not be necessarily limited to facilitation of the presequence binding to the trans site. Indeed, it has been shown that Tom7 contributes to assembly of the TOM complex (27Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tom22 also promotes assembly of the TOM complex (31van Wilpe S. Ryan M.T. Hill K. Maarse A.C. Meisinger C. Brix J. Dekker P.J. Moczko M. Wagner R. Meijer M. Guiard B. Honlinger A. Pfanner N. Nature. 1999; 401: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), although which domain of Tom22 is required for the assembly is not clear. We thus examined the effects of the deletion of Tom7 and/or Tom22C on the stability of the TOM complex. Total membrane fractions were isolated from WT, Δtom7, Δtom22C, and Δtom22C/Δtom7 cells and solubilized with the non-ionic detergent digitonin. The solubilized proteins were subjected to analyses by BN-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Tom40 antibodies (Fig. 6D). In wild-type cells, the holo-TOM complex was detected as a 440-kDa complex on the BN-PAGE gel. The TOM complex with deleted Tom7 exhibited slightly faster mobility than the wild-type TOM complex, probably because of the lack of Tom7 from the 440-kDa complex. On the other hand, the deletion of Tom22C led to the shift of the TOM complex from the 440-kDa complex to a 120-kDa complex, suggesting that Tom22C is important for the stability of the 440-kDa TOM complex. An additional deletion of Tom7 from the TOM complex without Tom22C exhibited mobility similar to that found with deletion of Tom22C alone. Therefore, Tom22C contributes to the stability of the 440-kDa TOM complex. In the present study, we analyzed the requirements of presequences and subunits of the TOM complex in the presequence binding to the cis and trans sites of the TOM complex. The cis site for mitochondrial presequences has been suggested to consist of Tom20, Tom22, and Tom5. Among these subunits, Tom20 is the best characterized with respect to interactions with presequences. The NMR structure of the cytosolic domain of rat Tom20 (dTom20) has a hydrophobic groove where amphiphilic presequence peptides can bind through hydrophobic interactions (16Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The affinity (Kd) between mitochondrial presequences and/or precursor proteins and dTom20 has been reported; Kd values were determined as 20–30 μm by NMR titration analyses (16Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), 0.003 μm by sucrose density gradient analyses (13Komiya T. Rospert S. Koehler C. Looser R. Schatz G. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3886-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and ∼0.05–0.12 μm by surface plasmon resonance measurements (14Iwata K. Nakai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 649-652Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, we could not detect the cis site-bound form after incubation of pSD fusion proteins bearing a short presequence with de-energized mitochondria (Fig. 2). Why are the cis site-bound forms unstable? In Fig. 2 we used 5 μm of dTom20 for binding assays with the purified Tom20 domain (Fig. 2C), and the concentration of Tom20 in intact mitochondria for cis site binding assays (Fig. 2B) is estimated to be 0.03 μm (32Dekker P.J. Ryan M.T. Brix J. Muller H. Honlinger A. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6515-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Under the present experimental conditions, a Kd of 20 μm leads to binding of 20% of pSD-(1–69) to purified dTom20 and that of 0.15% to Tom20 in mitochondria. Therefore, our present results are consistent with the submicromolar range of Kd (such as those determined by NMR titration analyses) for interactions between mitochondrial precursor proteins and Tom20. On the other hand, two types of the trans site-bound forms are efficiently generated for pSD with a long presequence; the fusion protein is anchored to the TOM complex only through its presequence at stage A, whereas both the presequence and the unfolded mature domain are involved in binding to the TOM complex at stage B. We found here that the first 14 residues of the pSu9 presequence are essential for anchoring the fusion protein as a stage A intermediate to the TOM complex by its binding to the trans site. Because the stage A intermediate is sensitive to salt treatment, interactions of the presequence with the trans site should be mainly electrostatic. This probability is consistent with the fact that the first 14 residues of the presequence contain a segment (residues 10–27) that could form a positively charged amphiphilic helix (not shown). The site-specific photo-cross-linking of stage A and stage B intermediates of pSD-(1–69) showed that the trans site consists of or is close to Tom7 as well as Tom40 and Tom22C. We found by BN-PAGE that the deletion of Tom7 did not affect the stability of the 440-kDa TOM complex but that the deletion of Tom22C (the C-terminal 33 residues) destabilized the TOM complex to generate a 120-kDa complex. The 120-kDa TOM complex remains the same even after the additional deletion of Tom7. In contrast, the previous report showed that the TOM complex with Tom22 without the C-terminal 31 residues still formed the 440-kDa complex (19Moczko M. Bömer U. Kübrich M. Zudall N. Hönlinger A. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6574-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 33Frazier A.E. Chacinska A. Truscott K.N. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7818-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These apparently divergent results could perhaps suggest that residues 32 and 33 from the C terminus of Tom22 may be important for the stabilization of the 440-kDa TOM complex. We observed that the deletion of Tom7 and Tom22C caused synthetic defects in cell growth on a non-fermentable medium (Fig. 5) and on mitochondrial protein import in vivo (Fig. 6). What is the overlapping function of Tom7 and Tom22C that is responsible for the synthetic defects? It may not be stabilization of the 440-kDa TOM complex, because a single deletion of Tom22C did not accumulate precursor proteins, although it caused dissociation of the 440-kDa complex. Because Tom22C mediates transfer of the precursor protein from the TOM complex to the TIM23 complex (8Kanamori T. Nishikawa S. Nakai M. Shin I. Schultz P.G. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3634-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 18Court S.A. Nargang F. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6574-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), Tom7 likely facilitates the TOM to TIM23 transfer of precursor proteins as well. Monitoring the effects of the double deletion of Tom7 and Tom22C on mitochondrial protein import in vitro would be helpful for further understanding of the mechanistic roles of Tom7 and Tom22C in protein translocation across the outer membrane. However, an attempt to do this was unfortunately unsuccessful, because Tom40 in mitochondria without Tom7 and Tom22C is highly susceptible to proteolysis during preparation of the mitochondria. Therefore, much about the precise roles of cooperation played by Tom7 and Tom22C in mitochondrial protein import is still open for future study. We thank P. G.

Hydroxylation of the β-carbon of dopamine consumes 1 mol of oxygen and 2 mol of ascorbate, yielding norepinephrine plus 2 mol of semidehydroascorbate. DBM was purified, sequenced, and studied in detail before it was cloned (4Dhariwal K.R. Black C.D.V. Levine M. J. Biol.

The second member of this family, peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM; EC 1.14.17.3), catalyzes the α-hydroxylation of the C-terminal Gly residue in many different secreted peptides (6Cuttitta F.

The 315-amino acid catalytic core of PHM, defined by truncation mutagenesis, is 28% identical to the corresponding region of DBM (9Southan C. Kruse L.I. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Structural studies on the catalytic core of PHM defined the active site and revealed key roles for six copper-binding ligands (10Eipper B.A. Park L.P. Dickerson I.M. Keutmann H.T. Thiele E.A.

Science. 1997; 278: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Enzymes homologous to DBM and PHM are not found in yeast or bacteria.Although the reactions catalyzed by DBM and PHM use very different substrates and produce very different products, the chemistry involved is similar and both enzymes produce products stored in regulated secretory granules and used for intercellular communication. Both enzymes are essential for survival. Genetically engineered mice lacking DBM are not viable (13Thomas S.A. Matsumoto A.M. Palmiter R.D. Nature. 2002; 374: 643-646Crossref Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Mice lacking PHM develop massive edema at about embryonic day 14, with no live progeny produced (14Czyzyk T.A. Morgan D.J. Peng B. Zhang J. Karantzas A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Drosophila lacking a functioning PHM gene generally die as late embryos (15Jiang N. Kolhekar A.S. Jacobs P.S. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Taghert P.H. Dev. Biol. 2000; 226: 118-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Both enzymes function in the lumen of the secretory pathway, and both require adequate supplies of substrate, reduced ascorbate, and copper. The vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT1 and VMAT2) couple uphill transport of dopamine to efflux of protons, to deliver dopamine to the lumen of the secretory pathway (16Nirenberg M.J. Liu Y. Peter D. Edwards R.H. Pickel V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8773-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Ugarte Y.V. Rau K.S. Riddle E.L. Hanson G.R. Fleckenstein A.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 472: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The peptidylglycine substrates of PHM are produced from prepropeptides synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and subject to endo- and exoproteolytic processing as they progress through the secretory pathway (6Cuttitta F. Anat. Rec. 1993; 236: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Oyarce A.M. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3270-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).A third family member, monooxygenase X (MOX), was identified in a search for genes whose expression was altered in senescent human fibroblasts (19Chambers K.J. Tonkin L.A. Chang E. Shelton D.N. Linskens M.H. Funk W.D. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 218: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although key active site residues are conserved, the published sequence for human MOX has no signal sequence, making it difficult to see how it could function in a manner similar to DBM or PHM. A screen for genes involved in neural crest development yielded chicken MOX (also known as dopamine β-hydroxylase-related, DBHR) (20Knecht A.K. Bronner-Fraser M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which includes an N-terminal signal sequence. A potential homolog identified in the mouse genome (BAA95089), also includes an N-terminal signal sequence. No substrate has been identified for human or chicken MOX.Because both DBM and PHM produce essential signaling molecules, it was tempting to speculate that MOX plays a similarly important role in signaling. Although very little is known about the MOX protein, transcripts encoding hMOX are prevalent in brain, kidney, and lung, with levels increasing in some lines of senescent fibroblasts (19Chambers K.J. Tonkin L.A. Chang E. Shelton D.N. Linskens M.H. Funk W.D. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 218: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Knecht A.K. Bronner-Fraser M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the developing chick embryo, MOX transcripts are expressed in newly differentiating neural crest cells, most migrating neural crest cells, and in non-neuronal tissues such as the myotome. The properties of the MOX protein have not been explored.We undertook these studies to determine whether a human MOX signal sequence could be identified. Monooxygenase family members present in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila were identified. We next determined the sites of expression of MOX in adult mouse tissues and compared the pattern of MOX expression to that of DBM and PHM. Using several antisera to MOX, we characterized the expression of exogenous MOX in endocrine and non-endocrine cells. The unique features of MOX suggest that it functions in the endoplasmic reticulum.MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation of RNA and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Tissues dissected from adult male and female C57/bl6 mice were extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) for preparation of RNA. cDNA was prepared from total RNA (1 μg) using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). This cDNA (5% of the product) was amplified using primers specific for mMOX, mDBH, mPHM, and mDBHL. For mMOX: forward primer, 5′-TCACTGCACTCTGGAGTGCCT; reverse primer, 5′-GGTACCCACCCATCTCTCCA. For mDBM: forward primer, 5′-CTGAGGGCAATGAGGCCCTG; reverse primer, 5′-GCCATCCCTGGCGAGCACAG. For mPHM: forward primer, 5′-CGCCAGCCTTGCCCTTGCCC; reverse primer, 5′-TGAGTATGGACTCGGTAGGC. Because an mDBHL transcript was not detected after 38 cycles of amplification, we used a nested PCR with 30 cycles for first primer pair and 25 cycles for the second pair: first forward primer, 5′-CGGATCAGCACCTTCTGGATG; first reverse primer, 5′-CCAGCTCATTGGTCACATAG; nested forward primer, 5′-ACCAAAGATGAGTCGGGAGCA; nested reverse primer, 5′-TTGCAGAGCTTGCACACCC.To study the tissue-specific expression of human MOX mRNA and to verify the N-terminal splice variants, we designed three forward primers: 5′-ACCTATCCGCACCGGACCCT for N-terminal hMOX long form; 5′-GGACCTGATTCCCCAGTTGGA for N-terminal hMOX short form; 5′-GCACTGTGAGAGTGATCTGGG for the common region. A reverse primer (5′-GCCTCTCTGTATCACTGGCTC) in the common region was paired with the three forward primers to generate PCR products specific for long form (620 bp), the short form (600 bp), and both forms (250 bp). Human tissue total RNA was purchased from Clontech, and cDNA was prepared as described above. Amplification with β-actin-specific primers was used as an internal standard (21McPherson C.E. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 284: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Construction of Expression Vectors—To generate an expression vector encoding full-length mMOX, we used a pair of primers with appended restriction enzyme sites (underlined): the forward primer included a Pci1 site, 5′-TACATGTGCGGCTGGCCACTGCT; the reverse primer included a NotI site, 5′-AGCGGCCGCGTACCCACCCATCTCTCCA. Mouse brain first strand cDNA was used as the PCR template, and the product was subcloned into the PCR II vector (TA-cloning vector, Invitrogen) and digested with Pci1 and NotI (New England Biolabs) to release the 1.8-kb mMOX insert. The pEAK10 expression vector (Edge Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD) was digested with NcoI and NotI to receive the mMOX insert. The insert was sequenced in its entirety by the Molecular Core at the University of Connecticut Health Center. To visualize mMOX in live cells, we fused GFP to the C terminus of mMOX (MOX-GFP). To evaluate the role of the C-terminal hydrophobic region (Leu597-Leu613), mMOX truncated at Arg596 was fused to GFP (MOX-Arg596-GFP) in the pEGFP-N2 vector (Clontech). Vectors encoding these MOX-GFP fusion proteins were prepared from the mMOX pEAK10 vector using a forward primer that contained the pEAK10 HindIII site just upstream of the translational start site, 5′-TCTCAAGCCTCAGACAGTGGTTCA. Both reverse primers included a KpnI site: for MOX-GFP, 5′-CGGGGTACCGCAAGCCCTGGCTGCTCAGGA; for MOX596s-GFP, 5′-CGGGGTACCACCGGAGGGAGAAAATGCCGTG. The PCR products were subcloned into the TA-cloning vector; inserts released with HindIII and KpnI were inserted into pEGFP-N2 vector digested with these same enzymes and sequenced.MOX Antibodies—Four MOX peptides were synthesized, and each was linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using glutaraldehyde: CT45 was raised to mMOX(243SSNFNDSVLDFGHE256); the mMOX(448KDRAVMTWGGLSTR461) and mMOX(346SLFHTIPPGMPEF358) peptides yielded no useable antibodies; CT164 was raised to mMOX(90YFTNADRELEKDAQQDY106). Production of antisera was carried out by Covance (Denver, PA). pEAK RAPID cells transiently transfected with vectors encoding GFP or mMOX were used to characterize the antisera. CT45 recognized native, but not SDS-denatured MOX; no signal was detected on Western blots of transiently transfected cells, but MOX could be visualized in paraformaldehyde-fixed transfected cells or immunoprecipitated from cell extracts. CT164 visualized a band of the expected mass only in cells expressing mMOX; samples prepared by denaturation at 37 °C or 50 °C exhibited substantially less aggregation than samples prepared by denaturation at 100 °C.Transfection of Cells—AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 10% NuSerum (Collaborative Research, Waltham MA). pEAK RAPID cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection, cells were grown to 80% confluence and rinsed with complete serum-free medium (CSFM) (22Steveson T.C. Zhao G.C. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40326-40337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23El Meskini R. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3020-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Expression vectors were incubated with LipofectAMINE 2000 (4 μg of DNA/10 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000; Invitrogen) for 20 min at room temperature, mixed with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and incubated with cells for 4–6 h. Two days after transfection, cells were harvested for analysis.Subcellular Fractionation—Transfected cells were harvested into ice-cold homogenization buffer (150 mm sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5) (0.5 ml/well of a 6-well plate) containing protease inhibitors and processed with a ball-bearing homogenizer (H&Y Enterprises, Redwood City, CA). Differential centrifugation yielded a series of pellets (P): P1, 4000 × gav for 5 min; P2, 14200 × gav for 15 min, a fraction enriched in secretory granules; P3, 355000 × gav for 15 min, a fraction enriched in lighter membrane compartments (22Steveson T.C.

Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3020-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); and the final supernatant (cytosol). Equal proportions of each fraction were subjected to Western blot analysis.Metabolic Labeling, Extraction, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Replica wells of pEAK RAPID cells were transiently transfected with mMOX.pEAK10. After 48 h, cells were rinsed with CSFM, incubated in medium lacking Met for 10 min, and then incubated in medium containing [35S]Met (0.7 mCi/ml) for 30 min (Pulse). After the pulse labeling, cells were rinsed with CSFM and either harvested immediately (Pulse) or further incubated in CSFM for the designed amount of time (Chase). Cells were extracted in 0.5 ml of TM buffer (20 mm sodium N-tris(hydroxymethy)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, 10 mm mannitol, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors) (24Oyarce A.M. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 287-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant (soluble fraction) was collected and the pellets (particulate fraction) were solubilized with 0.5 ml of TMT buffer (TM with 1% Triton X-100), followed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was kept in fresh tubes. Spent chase medium was collected, and protease inhibitors were added. For immunoprecipitation, samples were incubated with MOX antibody CT45 or CT164 for 2 h on ice; antigen/antibody complexes were isolated using Protein A-Sepharose beads. Bound proteins were dissociated by boiling the resin in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and fractionated on 4–15% SDS gels (Bio-Rad); gels were soaked in Enhance and Amplify (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to film. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, pEAK RAPID cells transiently expressing mMOX were extracted as above and MOX was isolated using CT164. Immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and visualized using antisera to MOX (CT164, 1:1000), calnexin (BD Biosciences, 1:1000), or calreticulin (BD Biosciences, 1:2500).To assess glycosylation, immunoprecipitates of metabolically labeled soluble and particulate MOX were heated at 100 °C for 5 min in 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and then diluted 2-fold with 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5). After treatment with endoglycosidase H (500 units/μl, New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 1 h, samples were analyzed using 4–15% SDS-PAGE and fluorography. pEAK RAPID cells transiently transfected with the mMOX.pEAK10 vector for 48 h were pretreated with 2 μg/ml of tunicamycin for 3.5 h. Cells were then incubated in medium containing [35S]Met and processed as described above.Membrane Fractionation and Sodium Carbonate Extraction—Isolation of intracellular membranes and extraction with sodium carbonate was described (25Zhai L. Chaturvedi D. Cumberledge S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33220-33227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). pEAK RAPID cells were transfected with pEAK10-MOX, pCIS-PAM-3, or pCIS-PAM-1 expression vectors for 48 h and harvested into TM buffer. After a 5-min centrifugation at 5,000 × g to remove debris, the supernatants were centrifuged at 355,000 × g for 30 min to separate the soluble fractions and pellets. Pellets were resuspended in 100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0, for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 355,000 × g for 1 h to generate sodium carbonate insoluble fraction, which was then sonicated into TMT buffer, and a sodium carbonate soluble fraction. Equal amounts of each fraction were subjected to Western blot analysis with CT164 for MOX, GFP polyclonal antibody (AbCam, 1:2500) for MOX-GFP and MOX-Arg596-GFP, and PAM polyclonal antibody 1761 (1:1000) for PAM-3 and PAM-1.Immunofluorescence—AtT-20 cells transiently transfected with mMOX.PEAK10 or mMOX.GFP vectors were fixed with 4% formalin 48 h after transfection. Following permeabilization with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and blocking with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, MOX-GFP was visualized directly and MOX was visualized using affinity-purified or crude CT164 (1:1000) and Cy3-anti-rabbit-IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory Inc., 1:1000). At the same time, various marker proteins were visualized: BiP (Affinity BioReagents, rabbit polyclonal, 1:100); ACTH (NOVACASTRA, monoclonal antibody, 1:500); and syntaxin 6 (BD Transduction Laboratories, monoclonal antibody, 1:300). Images were obtained under oil using a 60× lens on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope with a Hamamatsu Orca ER Digital charge-coupled device camera operated in Open Lab (Improvision, Lexington, MA); z-stacks were subjected to deconvolution using Volocity software (Improvision).Sucrose Gradient Fractionation—Continuous sucrose gradients were prepared using solutions of 5 and 20% sucrose in TMT buffer; a cushion of 50% sucrose in the same buffer was placed below the 1878 μl of gradient. Samples of metabolically labeled MOX (250 μl of a 30-min Pulse sample) and culture medium from a stably transfected DBM cell line were placed above the gradient. Before application to the gradients, samples were either treated with dithiothreitol (1 mm for DBM; 10 mm for MOX; 30 min at 37 °C) or not. Gradients were centrifuged for 5 h at 214,000 × g in a Ti-55 swinging bucket rotor (22Steveson T.C. Zhao G.C. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40326-40337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For calibration, a sample containing cytochrome c, ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin, catalase, and apoferritin (200 μg each) was analyzed simultaneously. After centrifugation, samples were collected starting from the top of the gradient; 1× Laemmli sample buffer was used to recover protein that reached the bottom of the gradient. MOX was immunoprecipitated from each fraction using CT45 and fractionated on a 10% SDS gel. For DBM, equal aliquots of each fraction were fractionated on a 10% SDS gel and detected with a DBM antibody (1:1000, Ab3125).RESULTSDistinguishing Features among Copper Monooxygenase Family Members—Although their catalytic cores are highly homologous, the topologies predicted for MOX, DBM, and PAM are distinctly different (Fig. 1). Although mouse MOX is predicted to have a cleaved signal sequence, human MOX lacks a signal sequence (19Chambers K.J. Tonkin L.A. Chang E. Shelton D.N. Linskens M.H. Funk W.D. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 218: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Both mouse and human MOX have a stretch of 17 hydrophobic residues near their C termini. DBM has a signal anchor, and its disulfide-linked dimers form tetramers (26Robertson J.G. Adams G.W. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11563-11575Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PAM is a Type 1 membrane protein with an N-terminal signal sequence and a transmembrane domain near its C terminus (27Husten E.J. Eipper B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similar disulfide bonding patterns have been identified in DBM and PAM, and these Cys residues are conserved in MOX (Fig. 1).Both the human genome and the Drosophila genome contain three copper monooxygenase family members (Table I). Consistent with their size and predicted topologies, the catalytic core of MOX is more similar to DBM than to PHM. The mouse genome contains a fourth copper monooxygenase family member, DBHL, which is slightly more similar to MOX than to DBM. Although the intron/exon boundaries of mDBHL are similar to those of hMOX and hDBM, a gene resembling mDBHL could not be identified in the human genome. The functions of two of the Drosophila copper monooxygenases have been studied: the catalytic core of dPHM is 39% identical to that of hPHM, and the catalytic core of Drosophila tyramine β-hydroxylase is 50% identical to that of hDBM (Table I). The third family member in Drosophila is almost equally identical to hMOX and hDBM and is designated dMOX. The C. elegans genome encodes only two family members. C. elegans PHM is 38% identical to hPHM. The protein encoded by C. elegans cosmid H13N06 (19021–24000 bp) is 48% identical to hDBM, identifying it as part of the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway. In C. elegans, as in Drosophila, the major function of this enzyme is hydroxylating tyramine to produce octopamine (28Monastirioti M. Linn Jr., C.E. White K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3900-3911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table IThe copper monooxygenase family (catalytic core)% IdentityhMOXhDBMhPHM%MOX human1003925Mouse814226Drosophila353424DBM human3910028Mouse378027TBH Drosophila345025C. elegans354828PHM human2528100Mouse252895Drosophila252639C. elegans202338DBHL mouse413723 Open table in a new tab Knowledge of the crystal structure of PHMcc and biochemical modification of DBM provide another means of analyzing MOX (Table II). The six ligands that interact with the two essential copper atoms in PHM are completely conserved among all family members. The active site residues that interact with the peptidylglycine substrate have been identified (1Prigge S.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Amzel L.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1236-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 12Prigge S.T. Kolhekar A.S. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Amzel L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In addition, molecular modeling has predicted residues in DBM that may interact with its substrate, dopamine (1Prigge S.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Amzel L.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1236-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). When the homologous residues in MOX are identified, it is striking that all are hydrophobic. For example, Arg240, which binds the peptide carboxylate in PHMcc, is Gln395 in hDBM and Leu319 in hMOX. Similarly, Asn316 in PAM is another Leu in MOX. If the active site of MOX resembles that of PHM, its substrate is unlikely to be charged or highly polar.Table IICopper and substrate binding residues Rat PHM: CuA, CuB, and substrate interacting residues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Open table in a new tab Expression of MOX Is Widespread—We next set out to determine where MOX was expressed and to compare its expression pattern to those of PAM and DBM (Fig. 2). Total RNA prepared from the indicated adult mouse tissues was reverse-transcribed, and the cDNA used as a PCR template (Fig. 2). Genespecific primers were designed for PAM (420 bp), DBM (520 bp), MOX (420 bp), and DBHL (702 bp). MOX transcripts were readily identified in a wide variety of adult tissues. Levels were highest in the salivary gland and ovary, with lower levels in olfactory bulb, cerebellum/brain stem, parietal cortex, pituitary, atrium, ventricle, adrenal, thymus, testis, and kidney. Still lower levels of MOX transcript were detected in lung, lymph nodes, spleen, and liver (Fig. 2). Expression of DBM is much more restricted, with significant signal detected only in adrenal and detectable amounts in brainstem. As expected from similar studies in the rat, PAM transcripts are widely expressed, with highest levels in pituitary, atrium, ventricle, lung, and adrenal (Fig. 2). Expression of DBHL is very low and highly restricted. Signal was detected only in the thymus and the testis, and only after a nested PCR; the smaller PCR product detected in the testis could be nonspecific or a splice variant.Fig. 2MOX transcripts are expressed in a wide variety of adult tissues. cDNA prepared from the adult mouse tissues indicated was reverse-transcribed and used for PCR. Primer sets specific for mouse MOX, DBM, PAM, and DBHL were used to compare patterns of expression. PCR amplification: PAM, 25 cycles; DBM, 30 cycles; MOX, 35 cycles; DBHL with nested PCR, 30 cycles followed by 25 cycles. Actin levels in all samples were comparable (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)hMOX Can Include an N-terminal Signal Sequence—Following the identification of human MOX (hMOX; GenBank™ accession number AY007239), homologous genes were identified in mouse (mMOX; GenBank™ accession number: BAA95089), and chicken (GenBank™ accession number AF327450) (20Knecht A.K.

Several studies have shown that the levels of expression of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) or cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) are altered in cultured VSMC. In this study the mechanisms involved in the coordinated expression of sGC and PKG were examined. Pro-inflammatory cytokines that increase the expression of type II NO synthase (inducible NO synthase, or iNOS) decreased PKG expression in freshly isolated, non-passaged bovine aortic SMC. However, in several passaged VSMC lines (i.e. bovine aortic SMC, human aortic SMC, and A7r5 cells), PKG protein expression was not suppressed by cytokines or NO. sGC was highly expressed in non-passaged bovine aortic SMC but not in passaged cell lines. Restoration of expression of sGC to passaged bovine SMC using adenovirus encoding the α1 and β1 subunits of sGC restored the capacity of the cells to increase cGMP in response to NO. Furthermore, treatment of these sGC-transduced cells with NO donors for 48 h resulted in decreased PKG protein expression. In contrast, passaged rat aortic SMC expressed high levels of NO-responsive sGC but demonstrated reduced expression of PKG. Adenovirus-mediated expression of the PKG catalytically active domain in rat aortic SMC caused a reduction in the expression of sGC in these cells. These results suggest that there is a mechanism for the coordinated expression of sGC and PKG in VSMC and that prolonged activation of sGC down-regulates PKG expression. Likewise, the loss of PKG expression appears to increase sGC expression. These effects may be an adaptive mechanism allowing growth and survival of VSMC in vitro.

The nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP signaling pathway plays a critical role in vascular function (1Wong S.K. Garbers D.L. J. Clin.

Cyclic GMP is a second messenger that is generated by cytoplasmic soluble guanylyl cyclases (sGCs), 1The abbreviations used are: sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSM); PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; Cat, active catalytic domain of PKG-I; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; iNOS, inducible NO synthase; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL-Iβ, interleukin Iβ; DETA NONOate, (Z)-1-[2-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate; DEA NONOate, 2-(N,N-diethylamino)-diazenolate-2-oxide; HuAoSMC, human aortic smooth muscle cells; A7r5, rat embryonic thoracic aortic smooth muscle cells; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Ad, adenovirus; SNAP, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection. which are activated by NO, or particulate guanylyl cyclases, which are activated by peptide hormones such as atrial natriuretic peptide. sGC is a heterodimer that consists of two subunits, termed α and β, which are linked by disulfide bonds, and has a prosthetic heme group covalently bound to the heterodimer (1Wong S.K. Garbers D.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 2Denninger J.W. Marletta M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). NO activates cGMP synthesis by binding to the heme, leading to the conversion of GTP to cGMP. Although two isoforms of each subunit have been cloned from rat and bovine lung, the a1b1 heterodimer has been found in most tissues and cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) (3Harteneck C.

NO and cGMP are involved in many physiological processes such as VSMC relaxation, apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix production (7Garg U.C. Hassid A. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 83: 1774-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1997) Google Scholar, 8Sarkar R. Meinberg E.G. Stanley J.C. Gordon D. Webb R.C. Circ.

Circulation. 1997; 95: 1101-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An important cGMP receptor protein expressed in VSMC is cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), which is ultimately responsible for mediating the effects of cGMP in vascular smooth muscle relaxation (11Schlossmann J. Feil R. Hofmann F. Ann. Med. 2003; 35: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). There are two distinct genes encoding PKG in mammalian cells, the type I and type II genes (12Wernet W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 13Francis S.H. Woodford T.A. Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Second Messengers Phosphoproteins. 1988; 12: 301-310PubMed Google Scholar). Type I, which is the gene product expressed in VSMC, exists as two isoforms, PKG Iα and PKG Iβ, generated by alternate mRNA splicing of the type I gene (13Francis S.H. Woodford T.A. Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Second Messengers Phosphoproteins. 1988; 12: 301-310PubMed Google Scholar). There is much current interest in the regulation of gene expression by NO and cGMP (14Pilz R.B. Casteel D.E. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 1034-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, less is known about the regulation of PKG and sGC gene expression in VSMC. This is particularly important because several studies demonstrate that sGC and PKG expression are altered in VSMC in culture. Indeed, we have suggested that the loss of PKG expression in cultured rat aortic VSMC may be responsible in part at least for the phenotypic modulation of the cells from a more differentiated, contractile phenotype to a dedifferentiated, synthetic phenotype (15Boerth N.J. Dey N.B. Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Vasc. Res. 1997; 34: 245-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Several studies show that PKG expression is decreased in VSMC after balloon catheter injury in vivo (16Sinnaeve P. Chiche J.D. Gillijns H. Van Pelt N. Wirthlin D. Van De Werf F. Collen D. Bloch K.D.

Recently our laboratory demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), biological modulators associated with inflammation, suppressed PKG I gene expression in VSMC through a mechanism involving the expression of inducible, type II NO synthase (iNOS). Other studies show that sGC is down-regulated in various cells in response to various stimuli (18Ujiie K. Hogarth L. Danziger R. Drewett J.G. Yuen P.S. Pang I.H. Star R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 761-767PubMed Google Scholar, 19Takata M. Filippov G. Liu H. Ichinose F. Janssens S. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol.

In rat pulmonary artery SMC, for instance, NO donors were found to reduce sGC subunit mRNA levels, and this effect was inhibited by the addition of a selective sGC inhibitor (20Filippov G. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Additionally, sGC has been shown to be down-regulated in young and aging rats that are spontaneously hypertensive (21Ruetten H. Zabel U. Linz W. Schmidt H.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of sGC and/or PKG would be expected to impair the ability of NO to regulate VSMC functions, potentially contributing to the excessive proliferation and secretory activity of VSMC in vascular disorders. In the current study we have examined the role of sGC activity on PKG expression in cultured VSMC. We found in several lines of VSMC expressing high levels of PKG that pro-inflammatory cytokines and NO donor compounds were unable to induce cGMP synthesis or reduce PKG expression. This lack of responsiveness was determined to be due to loss of sGC activity and protein expression. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of α1 and β1 sGC subunits followed with NO treatment decreased PKG protein expression in VSMC. Materials—Fetal bovine serum (FBS), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), penicillin-streptomycin, and gentamicin were purchased from Invitrogen. Human recombinant IL-Iβ and TNF-α were purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). LPS was obtained from Sigma. (Z)-1-[2-(2-Aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DETA NONOate) and 2-(N,N-diethylamino)-diazenolate-2-oxide (DEA NONOate) were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HuAoSMC) were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Rat embryonic thoracic aortic VSMC (A7r5) were purchased from American Type Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All other reagents were purchased from Fisher or VWR Scientific (West Chester, PA). Cell Culture—Aortas from freshly sacrificed cattle were generously provided by Kimbrell Slaughterhouse (Saraland, AL) and Richardson Meat (Tuscaloosa, AL). Bovine aortic VSMC were prepared from the anterior region below the aortic arch. Briefly, cells were propagated in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B, 200 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin and grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Most experiments were conducted using passaged bovine aortic VSMC (passage 2–10). HuAoSMC were grown according to the manufacturer's specifications and protocol. A7r5 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 50 μg/ml gentamicin in a 10% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Rat aortic VSMC were isolated and cultured as previously described (22Dey N.B. Boerth N.J. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Chang P.L. Prince C.W. Lincoln T.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Rat aortic VSMC were grown in DMEM containing 5% FBS, 5% calf serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin in a 10% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The routine subculturing procedure was to remove the cells using buffered trypsin and to plate the cells at as 35,000 cells/cm2 plating density. Viability was assessed after each experiment using trypan blue exclusion. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis—Cultured VSMC were extracted with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μm leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, and 10 mm benzamidine. After centrifugation, the supernatants (10 μg) were mixed with an equal volume of 2× sample loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.9, 4% SDS, 50% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue and 1.4% β-mercaptoethanol). The proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were blocked in 5% nonfat milk and probed with anti-PKG (Stressgen, Carlsbad, CA), anti-sGC (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), or anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibodies as previously described (22Dey N.B. Boerth N.J. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Chang P.L. Prince C.W. Lincoln T.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Isolation of RNA and Northern Analysis—Total cellular RNA was isolated from cell monolayers using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Valencia, CA) as instructed by the manufacturer's protocol. RNA (15 μg) was resolved on 1% formaldehyde agarose gels, and Northern analysis was performed as previously described (22Dey N.B. Boerth N.J. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Chang P.L. Prince C.W. Lincoln T.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were then washed with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature, 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C, and 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS at 65 °C, consecutively. All values were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase values, which served as the housekeeping gene for quantitative analysis. The probes for bovine iNOS and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were generated as purified insert DNAs and labeled using the Stratagene Random Prime DNA labeling kit (La Jolla, CA). Amplification of Adenovirus—Adenoviruses (Ad) expressing the α1 and β1 subunits of sGC or the catalytic domain of PKG were generated as previously described (23Sinnaeve P. Chiche J.D. Nong Z. Varenne O. Van Pelt N. Gillijns H. Collen D. Bloch K.D. Janssens S. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, Adα1, Adβ1, Ad-Cat, and AdLacZ are E1-deleted replication-defective adenoviruses. Ad α1 contains the cDNA encoding the 82-kDa α1 subunit of sGC. Ad β1 contains the cDNA encoding the 70-kDa β1 subunit of sGC. Ad-Cat contains the coding sequence for the PKG-1 catalytic domain (residues 336–671 of the α isoform). AdLacZ carries the lacZ gene encoding a nuclear-localizing variant Escherichia coli β-galactosidase. Adenovirus was amplified based on a method developed by Becker (24Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). All peak fractions were combined, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin was added. The virus titer was analyzed by plaque assay, and aliquots were stored at –80 °C to prevent degradation. Adenovirus Infection of Aortic SMC—Bovine aortic VSMC (passage 2–10) were plated at a 15,000 cells/cm2 density and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were infected with AdLacZ (200 m.o.i.) or co-infected with Adα1 and Adβ1 (m.o.i. 50–100 each) for 4 h in DMEM without serum at 37 °C. Culture medium containing 10% FBS was added to each plate, and cells were allowed to grow for 48 h. Infection efficiency was measured using the Stratagene in situ β-galactosidase immunohistochemical staining kit (La Jolla, CA) and by immunostaining for the β1 subunit of sGC. Similar to previous studies using rat aortic SMC infected with PKG-containing adenovirus (15Boerth N.J. Dey N.B. Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Vasc. Res. 1997; 34: 245-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we found that for sGC subunit expression, an m.o.i. of 100–200 was sufficient to infect >90% of the cells. For infection of rat aortic SMC with Ad-Cat, an m.o.i. of 200 was sufficient to infect 90% of the cells. Cyclic Nucleotide Radioimmunoassay—cGMP levels were quantified using the radioimmunoassay method as previously described (25Cornwell T.L. Arnold E. Boerth N.J. Lincoln T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in 35-mm dishes and treated with cytokines or NO donors. Cells were extracted with 750 μl of 0.1 n HCl, 50% methanol. The extracts were lyophilized and resuspended in 500 μl of water for determination of cGMP levels. Tubes were counted for 1 min in a Cobrell Auto Gamma counter (Packard), and data were analyzed using Assay Zap software (Biosoft). Each plate was scraped with 0.1 n NaOH and assayed for protein concentration by the Bradford method. Sample values were compared with protein concentration and expressed as pmol of cGMP per mg of protein. Soluble Guanylyl Cyclase Activity Assay—Intracellular activity of sGC was measured using a modified method developed by Murad and co-workers (4Buechler W.A. Nakane M. Murad F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested with 1.0 ml of 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl buffer, pH 7.6. Samples were homogenized, sonicated for 20 s at 50% power, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Sample supernatants were collected, and protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. Each reaction contained 30 μg of sample in a final volume of 100 μl of 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 7.5 mm creatine phosphate containing 5 units of creatine phosphokinase. Each reaction was preincubated in the absence or presence of 10 μm DEA-NONOate for 10 min at 37 °C. Assays were initiated by the addition of 4 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm GTP. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and terminated by the addition of 900 μl of ice-cold 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0. Samples were placed on ice for 5 min. Supernatants were collected, and a cGMP radioimmunoassay was performed. Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Each experiment was performed in duplicate with n = 3. Statistical differences between values were evaluated by Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance. Statistical significance was then determined by Tukey's post-test using GraphPad Prism software with significant probabilities at p < 0.05. Effect of Cytokines on PKG Expression—Initial studies were conducted to identify smooth muscle cell model systems for examining the relationship between PKG expression and cytokine-dependent elevations in cGMP concentrations. In primary bovine aortic SMC, cytokines, such as IL-Iβ and TNF-α, as well as LPS increased intracellular cGMP levels and decreased PKG mRNA and protein expression (25Cornwell T.L. Arnold E. Boerth N.J. Lincoln T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, similar studies performed with bovine aortic SMC that had been passaged several times (2–9 passages) yielded entirely different results. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment with IL-Iβ, TNF-α, or LPS had no significant effect on PKG protein expression in passaged bovine aortic SMC. Similar results were obtained when this experiment was conducted in HuAoSMC and A7r5 cells (not shown). To determine the reasons for the differences observed between primary and passaged bovine aortic SMC, the effects of cytokines and LPS on the NO-cGMP-signaling pathway were more closely examined. As shown in Fig. 2, TNF-α, IL-Iβ, or LPS increased iNOS mRNA expression in passaged bovine aortic SMC. The fold-increase in iNOS mRNA expression was difficult to quantify because non-treated cells express little if any measurable iNOS. Nevertheless, these findings confirmed those of other laboratories and demonstrated that the cytokine signaling pathway that is responsible for iNOS expression was present in both the primary and the passaged VSMC (25Cornwell T.L. Arnold E. Boerth N.J. Lincoln T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Beasley D. Eldridge M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1197-R1203PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2Effect of cytokines and LPS on iNOS mRNA expression. Passaged bovine aortic VSMC were stimulated with IL-Iβ (10 ng/ml), TNF-α (10 ng/ml), or LPS (100 μg/ml) for 24 h, and iNOS mRNA levels were measured by Northern blot analysis. CTL, control; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Effect of Cytokines and NO Donors on cGMP Production—We examined the effects of cytokines on cGMP levels in primary and passaged bovine aortic SMC. Cells were treated with cytokines and LPS for 24 h, and cGMP levels were assessed. As shown in Fig. 3A, cytokines and LPS increased cGMP levels 10–20-fold in primary, non-passaged bovine aortic SMC, whereas in the passaged cultures of bovine aortic SMC the cytokines had no significant effect on cGMP levels (Fig. 3B). To determine whether these results could have been due to sGC that was unresponsive to the effects of cytokines bovine aortic SMC were treated with different NO donors, and cGMP levels were measured. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, NO donors SNP (10 μm), SNAP (100 μm), and DEA-NONOate (1 and 5 μm) had no effect on cGMP levels in passaged bovine aortic SMC or HuAoSMC, respectively. In contrast, treatment of passaged rat aortic SMC with these NO donors resulted in a more than 100-fold elevation in cGMP levels (Fig. 4C). The actions of SNP and SNAP depend on cell metabolism to release NO, whereas DEA NONOate directly releases NO, suggesting that the lack of response to the various NO donor drugs was not due to defects in the capacity of the cells to produce NO from NO donors but, rather, from decreases in NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase.Fig. 4Effect of NO donors on cGMP production in VSMC. Cells were treated for 3 min with DEA NONOate (1 or 5 μm) or for 5 min with SNP (10 μm) or SNAP (100 μm), and cGMP levels were measured using radioimmunoassay. Panel A represents passaged bovine aortic SMC (passage 5), panel B represents passaged human aortic SMC (HuA-oSMC), and panel C represents passaged rat aortic SMC (passage 16–21).

To explain this decrease in sGC activity, we analyzed sGC protein expression by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5B, immunoblotting using antibodies that detect primarily the β1 of sCG indicated that high levels of sGC protein were expressed in rat lung, passaged rat aortic SMC, pulverized bovine aorta, and primary bovine aortic SMC. However, sGC protein expression was undetectable in passaged bovine aortic SMC and HuAoSMC. It is also important to note that the expression of PKG was high in both primary and passaged bovine aortic SMC and HuAoSMC but was virtually absent in passaged rat aortic SMC (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that except for freshly plated primary cultures of bovine aortic SMC, the expression of PKG and sGC may be inversely correlated in cultured VSMC. Restoration of Soluble Guanylyl Cyclase Expression Using Adenovirus—The activity of sGC is dependent upon expression of both the α and β subunits of the enzyme. Adenoviruses expressing each subunit, Adα1 and Adβ1, were utilized to restore sGC protein expression in passaged bovine aortic SMC. Co-infection with Adα1 and Adβ1 restored sGC expression in passaged bovine aortic SMC (Fig. 6A). To determine whether restoration of sGC protein expression yielded an active enzyme, adenoviral-infected cells were stimulated with DEA-NONOate (10 μm) for 3 min, and cGMP levels were measured. As shown in Fig. 6B, treatment of infected cells with DETA-NONOate increased cGMP production more than 100-fold, thus confirming the findings of Sinnaeve et al. (16Sinnaeve P. Chiche J.D. Gillijns H. Van Pelt N. Wirthlin D. Van De Werf F. Collen D. Bloch K.D. Janssens S. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2911-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Control infected cells contained no sGC activity and lacked NO responsiveness. Effect of NO on PKG Expression—To examine the possible role of sGC and NO in the regulation of PKG expression in VSMC, the sGC-expressing SMC infected with adenoviruses containing the coding sequences for the sGC subunits were treated with DETA NONOate (10 μm) for 48 h, and PKG expression was measured using immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 7, passaged bovine aortic SMC infected with AdLacZ, which served as a control, demonstrated no change in PKG protein expression in the presence of a NO donor. However, PKG expression was decreased more than 60% in cells co-infected with Adα1 and Adβ1 and stimulated with NO. These results suggest that NO-stimulated sGC and cGMP production inhibits PKG protein expression in passaged bovine aortic SMC and that sGC expression mediates PKG suppression in these cells. Effect of PKG on sGC Expression—To examine the role of PKG in regulating SGC expression we used passaged rat aortic SMC that express high levels of sGC but low levels of PKG (see Fig. 5). Infection of these cells expressing the active catalytic domain of PKG-I resulted in suppression the expression of the β1 subunit of sGC, whereas the α1 subunit was only marginally reduced by the presence of active PKG (Fig. 8). AdLacZ, which served as a control, had no effect on sGC subunit expression. These results suggest that active PKG-I can inhibit sGC activity by down-regulating the expression of the β1 subunit. The overall purpose of this study was to examine the role of sGC in regulating PKG levels in VSMC. Previously, our laboratory has shown that repetitively passaged rat aortic SMC express little or no PKG but are highly responsive to NO donors with large elevations in cGMP (25Cornwell T.L. Arnold E.

However, during the course of these investigations, we found that several other VSMC cultures, i.e. passaged bovine aortic SMC, HuAoSMC, and A7r5 cells, still express high levels of PKG. In this study, when attempting to activate PKG in these later cell lines by adding cytokines (Fig. 3) or NO donor compounds (Fig. 4), we were unable to increase cGMP levels above base line. Furthermore, incubation of these cell cultures with NO donors plus cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as isobutyl methylxanthine, did not greatly increase cGMP levels. 2N. C. Browner, N. B. Dey, K. D. Bloch, and T. M. Lincoln, unpublished observations. These findings have led us to conclude that in some passaged VSMC lines, PKG expression is not reduced but sGC is. Examination of sGC activity and protein expression revealed that several lines of passaged VSMC express no detectable levels of sGC. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of a1 and b1 sGC subunits restored expression and NO-dependent cyclase activity in passaged bovine aortic SMC. These results suggest that the reason for the loss in the capacity of these cell lines to respond to cytokines and NO donors with increases in cGMP is due to the loss in expression of sGC protein. A significant finding of the current study is that after restoration of sGC expression to passaged bovine aortic SMC, we could now readily down-regulate the expression of PKG in these cells by stimulating sGC (Fig. 7). In primary bovine aortic SMC that have been in culture for less than 24 h, both sGC and PKG are expressed, presumably reflecting the physiologic balance between these two proteins. However, within one passage, sGC expression is suppressed, whereas PKG expression is intact. Conversely, in rat aortic SMC where PKG expression is very low but sGC expression and activity are high, transduction of constitutively active PKG down-regulates sGC β1 subunit expression. Chen et al. (31Chen L. Daum G. Fischer J.W. Hawkins S. Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Gabbiani G. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) also found that decreased expression of the β1 subunit of sGC was sufficient to block NO-mediated cGMP formation in SMC from aged rats. The mechanism of such suppression is not well understood but may involve suppression of sGC subunit mRNA synthesis (18Ujiie K. Hogarth L. Danziger R. Drewett J.G. Yuen P.S. Pang I.H. Star R.A. J.

Recently, Kloss, Srivastava, and Mulsch (38Kloss S. Srivastava R. Mulsch A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1440-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have shown that activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) inhibits the expression of mRNA-stabilizing protein, HuR, in rat aortic smooth muscle. Similar effects could be operating for the NO/cGMP-mediated down-regulation of sGC. Thus, the current study has revealed a new dynamic balance between the expression of sGC and PKG. In culture, rat aortic SMC lose PKG expression but express very robust sGC activity and protein levels. A7r5 cells, HuAoSMC, and passaged bovine aortic SMC retain PKG expression but lose sGC expression. These findings suggest that in culture at least, VSMC may develop these adaptive mechanisms to control the NO-cGMP pathway to increase survival of the cells in culture. It is generally acknowledged that an active NO/cGMP signaling pathway can be either growth inhibitory for VSMC (28Jeremy J.Y. Rowe D. Emsley A.M. Newby A.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 580-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) or can promote apoptosis in VSMC (9Pollman M.J. Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Gibbons G.H. Circ.

Endogenous mechanisms that disrupt the NO/cGMP/PKG pathway in culture may allow growth and survival of cultured VSMC. Recent evidence suggests that sGC expression is decreased during vascular dysfunction. Kloss et al. (30Kloss S. Bouloumie A. Mulsch A. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) found that sGC expression is decreased in old and hypertensive strains of rats and that NO-dependent vasodilation was impaired. Decreased expression of the β1 subunit of sGC also prevented NO-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis from VSMC from older rats (31Chen L. Daum G. Fischer J.W. Hawkins S. Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Gabbiani G. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Overexpression of endothelial NO synthase in transgenic mice was found to decrease sGC activity (32Yamashita T. Kawashima S. Ohashi Y. Ozaki M. Rikitake Y. Inoue N. Hirata K. Akita H. Yokoyama M. Hypertension. 2000; 36: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and sGC was found to be desensitized by NO within seconds (33Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Filippov et al. reported that NO decreases sGC mRNA and protein levels in pulmonary arterial SMC by a cGMP-dependent mechanism (20Filippov G. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These results suggest that PKG itself may inhibit sGC expression, analogous to the effects of sGC to suppress PKG expression. There are a number of studies using cultured VSMC to define pathways that may be involved in the expression of genes that determine specific phenotypes of the cells. In culture, for instance, rat aortic SMC rapidly lose contractile function and become highly proliferative and secretory. Coincident with this change in phenotype, there is a decrease in the expression of PKG. Restoration of PKG expression to these cells by transfection or adenoviral gene transfer causes the cells to assume a more contractile phenotype again (15Boerth N.J. Dey N.B. Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Vasc. Res. 1997; 34: 245-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cultured bovine aortic SMC and HuAoSMC express abundant contractile phenotype markers such as smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. Likewise, these cells still express PKG and still have basal levels of cGMP present (although sGC expression is negligible). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the endogenous PKG, which has been shown by Corbin and co-workers (34Smith J.A. Reed R.B. Francis S.H. Grimes K. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 154-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) to exist in a partially active state, may be responsible in part at least for the expression of contractile phenotype markers in these cells. Loss of PKG expression, on the other hand, would lead to the loss in ability of the cells to maintain contractile phenotype markers even with robust sGC activity present. Other studies have demonstrated the importance of regulation of PKG expression in the development of vascular disease. Pfeifer et al. (35Pfeifer A. Klatt P. Massberg S. Ny L. Sausbier M. Hirneiss C. Wang G.X. Korth M. Aszodi A. Andersson K.E. Krombach F. Mayerhofer A. Ruth P. Fassler R. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) have shown that deletion of the PKG gene in mice resulted in hypertension and increased platelet adhesion and aggregation. Other studies have shown that PKG expression is decreased after vascular injury (16Sinnaeve P. Chiche J.D. Gillijns H. Van Pelt N. Wirthlin D. Van De Werf F. Collen D. Bloch K.D. Janssens S.

McNamara D.B. Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. Arteriosclerosis, Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2192-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These findings were similar to those reported by Sinnaeve et al. (16Sinnaeve P. Chiche J.D. Gillijns H. Van Pelt N. Wirthlin D. Van De Werf F. Collen D. Bloch K.D. Janssens S. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2911-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) in rat carotid arteries. Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of the PKG I catalytic domain reduced neointima formation in rats after balloon catheter injury (16Sinnaeve P. Chiche J.D. Gillijns H. Van Pelt N. Wirthlin D. Van De Werf F. Collen D. Bloch K.D. Janssens S. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2911-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because loss of sGC or PKG leads to enhanced development of vascular disease, it is possible that restoration of sGC or PKG function might effect disease progression. Although the results of these studies are consistent with an antiproliferative, proapoptotic role for the NO/cGMP/PKG pathway in vascular SMC, a recent report by Wolfsgruber et al. (36Wolfsgruber W. Feil S. Brummer S. Kuppinger O. Hofmann F. Feil R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13519-13524Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) suggests that the NO/cGMP/PKG pathway may also be pro-proliferative for vascular SMC. Both an in vivo mouse model and in vitro studies with cultured mouse aortic SMC were used to demonstrate such a role for PKG. It is not known, however, whether the high concentration of cGMP analogs used in this study could alter expression of enzymes in this pathway, making the cells more susceptible to growth factor-induced proliferation. Because the results of this study opposes many other studies regarding the role of the NO/cGMP/PKG pathway in vascular SMC growth, more studies will need to be done to more clearly assess the real biological role of cGMP and PKG on SMC growth and gene regulation. In summary, the aim of the current study was to examine molecular mechanism involved in the coordinated expression of sGC and PKG in VSMC. We found that pro-inflammatory cytokines and LPS decrease PKG protein expression in primary bovine aortic VSMC. However, PKG protein expression was not suppressed by cytokines or LPS in several lines of passaged VSMC. Detailed analysis of these passaged cell lines revealed that these lose expression and activity of sGC with cell passage. In contrast, rat aortic VSMC lose expression of PKG but maintain sGC activity and expression. Using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, sGC expression was restored in passaged bovine aortic VSMC. Additionally, chronic NO treatment of sGC-transduced cells resulted in a decrease in PKG expression. These results demonstrate that there is a coordination of sGC and PKG expression in VSMC, and our findings suggest an important role in the regulation of the NO-cGMP signaling pathway in the development of survival mechanism of VSMC in vitro."

Here, we report that cross-talk between CCR1-mediated signaling pathway and FcϵRI-mediated signaling pathway affects degranulation positively but affects chemotaxis of mast cells adversely. Costimulation via FcϵRI engagement with IgE/antigen and CCR1 engagement with recombinant human CCL3 synergistically enhanced degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells expressing human CCR1 (RBL-CCR1). Interestingly, FcϵRI engagement inhibited CCL3-mediated chemotaxis and membrane ruffling of RBL-CCR1 cells. Small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family, Rac, Cdc42, and Rho control chemotaxis by mediating the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Both a Rho inhibitor C3 exoenzyme and a Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 inhibited chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 cells toward CCL3, indicating that activation of the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway is required for the CCL3-mediated chemotaxis of the cells. Costimulation with IgE/antigen and CCL3 enhanced Rac and Cdc42 activation but decreased ROCK activation in RBL-CCR1 cells compared with that in the cells stimulated with CCL3 alone. These results suggest that costimulation via FcϵRI and CCR1 engagements induced 1) inhibition of membrane ruffling, 2) decreased ROCK activation, and 3) reciprocal imbalance between Small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family, which result in the inhibition of chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 cells. The cross-talk between FcϵRI-mediated signaling pathway and CCR-mediated signaling pathway would induce optimal activation and arrested chemotaxis of mast cells, thus contributing to allergic inflammation.

The cross-talk between FcϵRI-mediated signaling pathway and CCR-mediated signaling pathway would induce optimal activation and arrested chemotaxis of mast cells, thus contributing to allergic inflammation. Mast cells and basophils play an important role in IgE-associated allergic disorders and immune responses to parasites. FcϵRI cross-linking is a key event in the activation of mast cells and basophils. The FcϵRI is composed of three subunits: an α chain, a β chain, and a pair of γ chains, joined by a disulfide bond. The association of allergen with IgE bound to FcϵRI induces the transphosphorylation of cytoplasmic domains in the β- and γ-chains called immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs via Lyn activation, which trigger signaling cascades leading to activation of kinases, phosphatases, or GTPases (1Turner H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1999; 402: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 2Tkaczyk C. Gilfillan A.M. Clin. Immunol. 2001; 99: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). FcϵRI-mediated signaling induces a variety of events such as degranulation, increased gene transcription, and cytoskeleton rearrangement in mast cells and basophils (3Prussin C. Metcalfe D.D. J. Allergy. Clin. Immunol. 2003; 111: S486-S494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 4Kawakami T. Galli S.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Apart from the classical FcϵRI-mediated mechanism, mast cells and basophils are also activated by other substances such as chemokines and histamine-releasing factors (5Ono S.J. Nakamura T.

Chemokines are a superfamily of small, structurally related cytokine molecules characterized by their ability to affect trafficking of immune cells. Some chemokines, such as CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein-1α), CCL5 (RANTES), or CCL11 (eotaxin-1) have been reported to activate mouse, rat, or human mast cells and basophils in vitro (7Conti P.

In allergic inflammatory tissues, abundant expression of chemokines such as CCL3, CCL5, and CCL11 is observed both in the acute and late phase reactions (12Rothenberg M.E. Zimmermann N. Mishra A.

Immunol. 2001; 1: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that FcϵRI and chemokine receptor engagement either occurs simultaneously or in relatively rapid succession in mast cells and basophils in vivo. Recently, Laffargue et al. (14Laffargue M. Calvez R. Finan P. Trifilieff A. Barbier M. Altruda F. Hirsch E. Wymann M.P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) have shown that CCL3 or CCL5 significantly enhanced FcϵRI-mediated degranulation via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ-mediated signaling pathway in bone marrow-derived mast cells. The simultaneous engagement of FcϵRI and CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 1The abbreviations used are: CCR, CC chemokine receptor; DNP, dinitrophenyl; HSA, human serum albumin; MBS, myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; ROCK, Rho kinase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; Ag, antigen (DNP-HSA). appears to be important for optimal degranulation of mast cells in vitro and physiologically relevant levels of mast cell activation in vivo. However, it has not yet been established whether and how the simultaneous engagement of FcϵRI and CCR affects events other than degranulation of mast cells. In this paper, we show that costimulation via FcϵRI and CCR1 engagement synergistically enhances degranulation but inhibits CCL3-mediated chemotaxis using rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells. Family members of the Rho-like GTPases, Rac, Cdc42, and Rho control cell motility by mediating the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (15Nobes C.D. Hall A.

The costimulation via FcϵRI and CCR1 resulted in the imbalance of Rac, Cdc42, and Rho, which affected reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton that is normally required for optimal chemotaxis. The implications of these data on the biology of mast cell- or basophil-driven inflammatory responses and anti-inflammatory drug design are also discussed. Cell Culture—RBL-2H3 cells expressing human CCR1 (RBL-CCR1) (18Richardson R.M. Pridgen B.C. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9201-9208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 1 mg/ml G418. Tissue culture media and cell culture supplies were from Invitrogen. Degranulation Assay—Cells (3 × 105 cells/ml) were cultured with or without 25 ng/ml anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE mAb (SPE7; Sigma) in 24-well plates overnight. After washing, the cells were stimulated with 10.0 ng/ml dinitrophenyl human serum albumin (DNP-HSA; Sigma) and/or various concentrations of recombinant human CCL3 (R&D Systems Europe, Ltd., Abingdon, UK) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 20 min. After the stimulation, β-hexaminidase activity in the supernatants was measured with p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamide (Sigma) in 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.5) for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.2 m glycine buffer (pH 10.5). The release of 4-p-nitrophenol was detected by absorbance at 405 nm. Total β-hexaminidase activity was determined by lysing the cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% Triton. Chemotaxis Assay—The assay was performed using 24-well Trans-well™ cell culture chambers with 8.0-μm pore size (Corning Glass). After collecting with a cell scraper, cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were sensitized with anti-DNP-IgE in a 15-ml tube for 6 h. In some experiments, the cells were also incubated with C3 exoenzyme (Sigma) for 2 h or Y-27632 (Sigma) for 30 min. After washing, the sensitized cells (2 × 104 cells) in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin were seeded in the upper compartment, and the lower compartment was filled with 600 μl of the same medium containing recombinant human CCL3 and/or DNP-HSA. The chambers were incubated for 100 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The reaction was stopped with cold PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde. The number of cells that passed through the membrane was quantified by staining with Giemsa stain solution (BDH Laboratory Supplies, Dorset, UK) and counting the number of cells present in at least eight microscope fields (×40 objective). Scanning Electron Microscopy Analyses—RBL-CCR1 cells were allowed to adhere to glass coverslips and sensitized with anti-DNP-IgE overnight. After stimulation with DNP-HSA and/or recombinant human CCL3, the cells were fixed with 0.07 m sodium cacodylate-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 3% glutaraldehyde and 1% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then washed with cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), osmicated with a 1% aqueous solution of osmium tetroxide, rinsed in deionized water, dehydrated through ascending alcohols (1 × 10 min at 50–90% and 3 × 10 min at 100%), critical point-dried, and sputter-coated with gold prior to observation in a JEOL Model 6100 Scanning Electron Microscope operating at 15 kV. Immunostaining—After sensitization and stimulation as described above, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. The cells were then washed with PBS and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100. After blocking with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, the cells were stained with 0.1 μg/ml TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) for 30 min. Measurement of Rac and Cdc42 Activation—Rac1 and Cdc42 activation were assessed by pull-down assay (19Benard V. Bokoch G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). RBL-CCR1 cells (5 × 106 cells for Rac measurement or 1.0 × 107 for Cdc42 measurement) were cultured in complete medium overnight and were sensitized with anti-DNP-IgE mAb in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1.0% fetal bovine serum for 6 h. The cells were then stimulated with CCL3 and/or DNP-HSA. After washing with cold PBS, the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol), and an equal amount of lysate was incubated with glutathione S-transferase-p21-activated kinase binding domain-coupled glutathione-Swell Gel (Pierce) for 60 min at 4 °C. Proteins complexed to the gels or beads were recovered, resuspended in sample buffer, and heated at 95 °C for 5 min, after which they were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with mouse anti-RAC1 mAb (Pierce) or mouse anti-Cdc42 mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Pierce) and enhanced chemiluminescent kit (Pierce). Measurement of Rho-associated Coiled-coil-forming Protein Kinase (ROCK) Activation—ROCK activation was assessed by CycLex Rhokinase assay kit (Cyclex Co., Ltd.). After the sensitization with anti-DNP IgE and stimulation with CCL3 and/or DNP-HSA, 1.0 × 107 of RBL-CCR1 cells was lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% β-mercaptoethanol). The lysates were incubated with reaction buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm EGTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm ATP) in wells coated with myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (MBS) for 60 min at 30 °C. After washing, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phospho-MBS threonine-696 specific antibody was applied into wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Tetramethylbenzidine was used as a substrate, and the absorbance was read at 450 nm after the enzyme reaction was stopped with 0.5 n H2SO4. To examine total ROCK in lysates, the lysates were resolved by 8.0% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with goat anti-ROCKII mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and enhanced chemiluminescent kit. Statistical Analyses—Statistical significance was determined using analysis of variance. Costimulation via FcϵRI and CCR1 Engagement Enhances Degranulation but Inhibits Chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 Cells— Because the expression level of CCR1, a receptor of CCL3, on wild type RBL-2H3 cells was low, we used RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing human CCR1 (RBL-CCR1) to examine the effect of costimulation via FcϵRI and CCR1 engagement on mast cell events. As shown in Fig. 1, the costimulation via FcϵRI and CCR1 synergistically enhanced degranulation in RBL-CCR1 cells. FcϵRI-mediated stimulation using the anti-DNP IgE/DNP-HSA (Ag) system under optimal conditions induced 21.4 ± 0.8% of total degranulation in RBL-CCR1. Simultaneous stimulation with IgE/Ag and 300 ng/ml CCL3 induced 80.1 ± 2.1% of total degranulation in RBL-CCR1, whereas stimulation with 300 ng/ml CCL3 alone induced 22.1 ± 5.0% of degranulation (Fig. 1). The results indicate that there is cross-talk between the CCR1-mediated signaling pathway and FcϵRI-mediated signaling pathway in RBL-CCR1 cells. Therefore, we used the RBL-CCR1 cells as a model to examine the effect of simultaneous engagement of FcϵRI and CCR on events other than degranulation of mast cells. CCL3 induces a chemotaxis response of RBL-CCR1 cells, with the maximum motility observed at a concentration of 1.0 ng/ml (Fig. 2A). Next, we examined whether costimulation with Ag and CCL3 affects the chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 cells. Interestingly, the chemotaxis was decreased when RBL-CCR1 cells was sensitized with anti-DNP IgE mAb and costimulated with Ag and CCL3. Because the gradient of allergen proteins would be formed in tissues, especially in surface of tissues, we examined the effect of Ag stimulation with or without gradient on CCL3-mediated chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 cells by application of Ag to the upper and/or the bottom wells of the chamber for chemotaxis assay. The inhibition was observed when Ag was applied to the upper and/or the bottom wells (Fig. 2, A and B). Comparable chemotaxis toward CCL3 was observed between IgE-sensitized and IgE-nonsensitized RBL-CCR1 cells, indicating that IgE sensitization itself does not affect the CCL3-mediated chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 cells (data not shown). The chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 cells toward Ag alone was not observed after incubation for 100 min (Fig. 2B). The results indicate that FcϵRI engagement inhibits CCL3-mediated chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 cells. FcϵRI Engagement Inhibits CCL3-mediated Ruffling of RBL-CCR1 Cells—The rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is a crucial component of chemotaxis (15Nobes C.D. Hall A.

The inhibitory effect of FcϵRI engagement on chemotaxis suggests that costimulation with Ag and CCL3 affect reorganization of actin cytoskeleton of RBL-CCR1 cells. We therefore examined the effects of the costimulation on actin reorganization of RBL-CCR1 cells by immunostaining with TRITC-labeled phalloidin. As shown in Fig. 3A (a), RBL-CCR1 cells stimulated with 1.0 ng/ml CCL3 (optimal concentration for chemotaxis) dramatically showed membrane ruffling at 90 s. In contrast, RBL-CCR1 cells costimulated with 10.0 ng/ml Ag (optimal condition for degranulation) and 1.0 ng/ml CCL3 or stimulated with Ag alone exhibited less membrane ruffling compared with CCL3-stimulated cells (Fig. 3A, b and c). To examine the morphological changes in stimulated cells in more detail, we observed the cells using scanning electron microscopy. The most extensive membrane ruffling was observed in RBL-CCR1 cells at 90 s after stimulation with 1.0 ng/ml CCL3 (Fig. 3B (a)) or 10.0 ng/ml CCL3 alone (data not shown). When RBL-CCR1 cells were costimulated with 10.0 ng/ml Ag and 1.0 ng/ml CCL3, ruffling response of RBL-CCR1 cells was reduced (Fig. 3B (b)), compared with that of cells stimulated with CCL3 alone (Fig. 3B (a)). Ag-stimulated cells also exhibited less membrane ruffling compared with CCL3-stimulated cells (Fig. 3B (c)). In unstimulated cells, obvious morphological change was not observed at 90 s (Fig. 3B (d)). The results indicate that FcϵRI engagement inhibits pronounced CCL3-induced ruffling response of RBL-CCR1 cells. Costimulation via FcϵRI and CCR1 Decreases ROCK Activation but Enhances RAC and Cdc42 Activation in RBL-CCR1 Cells—Small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 control chemotaxis by mediating the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (15Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3743) Google Scholar, 16Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5225) Google Scholar, 17Ridley A.J.

It has been reported that Rho-dependent activation of ROCK was required for chemotaxis of mice mast cells toward Ag (20Ishizuka T. Okajima F. Ishiwara M. Iizuka K. Ichimonji I. Kawata T. Tsukagoshi H. Dobashi K. Nakazawa T. Mori M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2298-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Hence, we examined activation of ROCK, Rac1, and Cdc42 in RBL-CCR1 cells after stimulation with CCL3 and/or Ag. ROCK activation was examined by measuring the kinase activity to phosphorylate MBS. The kinase activity was detected in the lysate derived from CCL3-stimulated RBL-CCR1 cells at 1 min after the stimulation. As shown in Fig. 4, treatment of RBL-CCR1 cells with Y27632, a ROCK inhibitor, decreased the kinase activity, confirming that ROCK activation was involved in the phosphorylation of MBS. When RBL-CCR1 cells were costimulated with Ag and 1.0 or 10 ng/ml of CCL3, the kinase activity was reduced, compared with that in cells stimulated with CCL3 alone. Rac1 and Cdc42 activation in RBL-CCR1 cells was detected by a pull-down assay (19Benard V. Bokoch G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The maximum Rac1 and Cdc42 activation was detected at 1 min after stimulation of RBL-CCR1 cells with CCL3. Consistent with the chemotaxis assay, the optimal concentration of CCL3 for Rac1 and Cdc42 activation was 1.0 ng/ml (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the Rac1 and Cdc42 activation in RBL-CCR1 cells was rather enhanced by the costimulation with 1.0 ng/ml CCL3 and Ag. These results indicate that costimulation with Ag and CCL3 inhibits ROCK activation but enhances Rac and Cdc42 activation in RBL-CCR1 cells. It has been reported that ROCK-related signaling antagonizes Rac activity in fibroblasts (21Tsuji T. Ishizaki T. Okamoto M. Higashida C. Kimura K. Furuyashiki T. Arakawa Y. Birge R.B. Nakamoto T. Hirai H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether inhibition of ROCK affects Rac activation in RBL-CCR1 cells using Y27632. As shown in Fig. 5B, Rac activation in CCL3-stimulated RBL-CCR1 cells was enhanced by treatment with Y27632. The result suggests that the ROCK-related signaling pathway antagonizes Rac activity in RBL-CCR1 cells. Rho/ROCK Activation Pathway Is Required for CCL3-mediated Chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 Cells—Next, we examined whether a Rho/ROCK activation pathway was related to the chemotaxis ability of RBL-CCR1 cells in response to CCL3 and/or Ag using C3 exoenzyme, a Rho inhibitor, and Y-27632. As shown in Fig. 6, both C3 exoenzyme and Y-27632 inhibited CCL3-induced chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 cells. The inhibitory effect of C3 exoenzyme and Y-27632 was also observed in decreased chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 cells by costimulation with CCL3 and Ag. The inhibition ratio of both inhibitors on chemotaxis upon costimulation with Ag and CCL3 was comparable with that on chemotaxis upon stimulation with CCL3 alone. These results suggest that activation of Rho/ROCK pathway is required for CCL3-induced chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 cells. In this study, we demonstrate that FcϵRI engagement inhibits CCL3-mediated chemotaxis of RBL-2H3 cells expressing CCR1 (RBL-CCR1) (Fig. 2). The movement of cells toward chemoattractants requires actin cytoskelton rearrangement and polarization such as formation of leading edge and membrane ruffles. Costimulation with Ag and CCL3 decreases ruffle formation of RBL-CCR1 cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that the decreased ruffling response involves the inhibition of chemotaxis by the costimulation. At signal transduction level, CCL3-mediated chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 cells requires activation of the Rho/ROCK pathway (Fig. 6). We found that costimulation with Ag and CCL3 enhanced Rac and Cdc42 activation but decreased ROCK activation in RBL-CCR1 cells (Figs. 4 and 5). Decreased ROCK activation would be a mechanism by which FcϵRI engagement inhibits CCL3-mediated chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 cells. As well as ROCK activation, Rac activation is essential for CC chemokine-mediated chemotaxis of RBL-2H3 cells, as shown by inhibition of CCL11-induced chemotaxis via CCR3 with dominant negative Rac (22Woo C.H. Jeong D.T. Yoon S.B. Kim K.S. Chung I.Y. Saeki T. Kim J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cdc42 also appears to be required for directional motility during chemotaxis of immune cells (23Allen W.E. Zicha D. Ridley A.J. Jones G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 24Srinivasan S. Wang F. Glavas S. Ott A. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Kalman D. Bourne H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Interestingly, costimulation with CCL3 and Ag enhanced Rac and Cdc42 activation, although chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 cells was inhibited by the costimulation. The results indicate that reciprocal balance between Small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family is important to induce optimal chemotaxis of mast cells and basophils. It has been reported that the Rac- and Cdc42-related signaling pathway antagonizes Rho activity, whereas the Rho-ROCK signaling pathway antagonizes Rac activity in fibroblast (21Tsuji T. Ishizaki T. Okamoto M. Higashida C. Kimura K. Furuyashiki T. Arakawa Y. Birge R.B. Nakamoto T. Hirai H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25Tashiro A.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). In our study, treatment with ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632) enhanced Rac activation in RBL-CCR1 cells. The results could reflect antagonism between Rac/Cdc42-related and Rho/ROCK-related signaling pathways. It is likely that costimulation with CCL3 and Ag enhances Rac and Cdc42 activation, which results in reduced ROCK activation, and vice versa. FcϵRI engagement inhibited not only CCL3-mediated chemotaxis but also CCL3-induced membrane ruffling of RBL-CCR1 cells (Figs. 2 and 3). With the Rho GTPase family, Rac is the main regulator of membrane ruffling in RBL-2H3 cells, as shown by a significant decrease of membrane ruffling in the cells expressing dominant negative Rac (27Guillemot J.C. Montcourrier P. Vivier E. Davoust J. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2215-2225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the role of Rac in membrane ruffling formation, costimulation with CCL3 and Ag was expected to reduce Rac activation in RBL-CCR1 cells. However, Rac activation in the cells was enhanced by the costimulation. Recently, Doughman et al. (28Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J. Wojtasiak M.L. Bunce M.W. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23036-23045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) have showed that not only Rac signaling but also phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate synthesis by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase Iα was required for membrane ruffling. Rac stimulates Arp2/3 complex-induced actin polymerization through WAVE/SCAR proteins, leading to formation of branching actin filament networks found in membrane ruffling (29Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Smith L.G. Li R. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R109-R111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate produced by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase Iα is suggested to be essential for the formation of the actin filament polymerization through the Arp2/3 complex (28Doughman R.L.

Abrams C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34059-34065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have clearly shown that Rho but not Rac directly induces activation and membrane translocation of the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase Iα. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase Iα may not be activated enough for formation of membrane ruffling due to reduced ROCK activation by costimulation with CCL3 and Ag. Further study is required to elucidate the detailed mechanisms involved in the inhibition of membrane ruffling by FcϵRI engagement. The costimulatory effect of CCL3 and Ag upon mast cell degranulation has been observed in bone marrow-derived mast cells (14Laffargue M. Calvez R. Finan P. Trifilieff A. Barbier M. Altruda F. Hirsch E. Wymann M.P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In this paper, we confirm and extend the observations by showing that CCR1 can mediate the synergistic effect of CCL3 on degranulation of RBL-CCR1 (Fig. 1). In contrast, the costimulation with CCL3 and IgE/Ag decreased chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 cells toward CCL3 (Fig. 2). The chemotaxis of mast cells to a site of inflammation and the subsequent release of chemical mediators such as histamine and proteases upon degranulation are crucial to eliciting allergic inflammation. Considering the role of mast cells and basophils in allergic inflammation, these results are consistent with the biology of this response. Mast cells and basophils would migrate toward the chemokine gradient at a site of inflammation but stop and accumulate at the site where allergen concentration is high. Meanwhile, the degranulation of mast cells and basophils is enhanced by the costimulation with CCL3 and allergen at the site where the cells accumulate, thereby focusing the inflammatory response. Our results suggest that costimulation by CCL3 and Ag play important roles in the orchestration and focusing of the allergic response. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the cross-talk between the CCR1-mediated signaling pathway and FcϵRI-mediated signaling pathway affects not only degranulation but also actin reorganization and chemotaxis of RBL-CCR1 cells. The observed impact of costimulation of mast cells via CCR1 and FcϵRI is consistent with a model of chemokine-mediated recruitment followed by antigen “focusing.” The molecular basis of the antigen focusing would appear to involve a putative “stop signal” illustrated by impaired polarization and chemotaxis. Once recruited to a site of parasitic infection or allergen exposure, the accumulated mast cells and basophils are optimally activated by antigen and chemokine. A corollary to this work is that CCRs and signal transduction pathways downstream of CCRs may represent a new class of mast cell stability compounds for immunotherapy.

Either overexpression of a dominant-negative vitamin D receptor (VDR) or deletion of this sequence of 17 A-T base pairs abolished the repressive effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 by attenuating basal promoter activity, indicating that this region mediates the 1,25(OH)2D3 response and is involved in basal transcription. South-western blot analysis and DNA affinity purification show that an unidentified 110 kDa nuclear protein binds to the poly(A) element. Because 1,25(OH)2D3-liganded VDR neither binds to the polyadenine region of the PHEX promoter nor directly influences the association of the 110 kDa transfactor, we conclude that 1,25(OH)2D3 indirectly decreases PHEX expression via VDR-mediated repression (or modification) of this novel transactivator. Thus, we have identified a cis-element required for PHEX gene transcription that participates in negative feedback control of PHEX expression and thereby modulates the actions of phosphatonin.

Thus, we have identified a cis-element required for PHEX gene transcription that participates in negative feedback control of PHEX expression and thereby modulates the actions of phosphatonin. Bone mineral homeostasis is achieved by the concerted actions of several hormones that control the circulating levels of calcium and phosphate, as well as directly affect osteoblast-mediated mineralization and/or osteoclast-driven resorption (1Harada S. Rodan G.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 2Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4929) Google Scholar). Thus, skeletal mineral integrity is maintained by the availability of calcium and phosphate ions and by a coupled balance between the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Prominent among the endocrine factors that regulate bone mineral is the sterol, 1α-25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3), 1The abbreviations used are: 1,25(OH)2D3, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; VDR, vitamin D receptor; PHEX, phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome; XLH, X-linked hypophosphatemia; Hyp mice, the murine homologue of XLH, deficient in PHEX; PTH, parathyroid hormone; GH, growth hormone; SA-PMP, Streptavidin MagneSphere Paramagnetic Particles; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; N.P., nuclear protein extract; DNVDR, dominant-negative point mutant of hVDR; VDREs, vitamin D responsive elements; nVDREs, negative 1,25(OH)2D3 response elements; PAP110, PHEX activating protein 110; ARID, AT-rich interacting domain; TBE, Tris borate/EDTA., the active renal metabolite of vitamin D3 (3Haussler M.R.

Osteoblasts represent another target for 1,25(OH)2D3, where the sterol acts via VDR to induce bone remodeling proteins such as osteocalcin (6Terpening C.M. Haussler C.A. Jurutka P.W. Galligan M.A. Komm B.S. Haussler M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and osteopontin (7Noda M. Vogel R.L. Craig A.M. Prahl J. DeLuca H.F. Denhardt D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kitazawa S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 650-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, as a calcemic and phosphatemic hormone, 1,25(OH)2D3 operates directly to resorb/remodel bone, and we show in the present communication that this sterol paradoxically also inhibits mineralization by cultured osteoblasts. The mechanism whereby 1,25(OH)2D3 limits bone mineralization is herein characterized as the apparent up-regulation of a novel phosphaturic peptide(s), termed phosphatonin, via a repression in osteoblasts of the expression of a gene encoding a neutral endopeptidase PHEX (phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome) that is hypothesized to normally inactivate phosphatonin by proteolysis. Phosphatonin, an uncharacterized phosphaturic hormone that may include in part FGF23 (9Strewler G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5945-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), is an inhibitor of osteoblastic mineralization, which also blocks renal 25-OH-vitamin D3 bioactivation to 1,25(OH)2D3, and elicits hypophosphatemia by repressing the renal type IIa sodium phosphate cotransporter (NaPi-IIa) (10Drezner M.K. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 9-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The PHEX gene encodes an endopeptidase that is predominantly expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes (11The_Hyp_Consortium Nat.

Phenotypically, inactivating mutations in the PHEX gene results in vitamin D-resistant, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (X-linked hypophosphatemia; XLH) (11The_Hyp_Consortium Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). This familial disorder manifests as hypophosphatemia, low circulating 1,25(OH)2D3 levels for the prevailing blood phosphate, high serum alkaline phosphatase, and osteomalacia (13Rasmussen H. Tenenhouse H. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 6th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1989Google Scholar). A theoretical model postulates that phosphatonin regulates Pi reabsorption through changes in renal NaPi-IIa cotransporter expression. PHEX normally inactivates phosphatonin, limiting Pi excretion; in XLH, the mutant PHEX fails to inactivate phosphatonin, resulting in phosphaturia and hypophosphatemia (10Drezner M.K. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 9-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The defects in bone associated with XLH are not fully attributable to hypophosphatemia, and there is evidence for an intrinsic abnormality in the osteoblast (14Xiao Z.S. Crenshaw M. Guo R. Nesbitt T. Drezner M.K. Quarles L.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E700-E708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the observation that osteoblasts from Hyp mice (the murine homologue of XLH, deficient in PHEX), fail to mineralize in media supporting mineralization of normal osteoblasts. Further, when co-cultured with Hyp osteoblasts, normal osteoblasts exhibit a significant decrease in mineralization (14Xiao Z.S. Crenshaw M. Guo R. Nesbitt T. Drezner M.K. Quarles L.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E700-E708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, targeted expression of PHEX in Hyp mice osteoblasts is not sufficient to rescue the Hyp phenotype (15Liu S.G. Guo R. Tu Q.S.

These observations highlight the significance of the PHEX endopeptidase gene product in promoting osteoblastic mineralization, presumably by inactivating the phosphatonin antimineralization peptide. Regulation of PHEX both in vivo and in vitro by several hormones important for skeletal homeostasis has been reported. Up-regulation of PHEX expression was observed with IGF-I (17Zoidis E. Zapf J.

Conversely, PHEX was found to be down-regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) in UMR-106 osteoblastic cells (20Vargas M.A. St-Louis M. Desgroseillers L.

Desbarats M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and more recently in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated rats (22Brewer A.J. Canaff L. Hendy G.N. Tenenhouse H.S. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F739-F748Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In primary osteoblasts and MC3T3-E1 cells, 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated PHEX down-regulation was independent of the mineralization state of the cells (21Ecarot B. Desbarats M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, 1,25(OH)2D3 has also been reported to decrease mineralization in osteoblasts grown in culture (21Ecarot B. Desbarats M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Siggelkow H. Schenck M. Rohde M. Viereck V. Tauber S. Atkinson M.J. Hufner M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 279-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Finally, an altered mineralization response to 1,25(OH)2D3 was observed in osteoblasts isolated from Hyp mice compared with those isolated from normal mice (24Yamamoto T. Ecarot B. Glorieux F.H. Bone. 1992; 13: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These studies highlight the physiological relevance of PHEX in osteoblast function and point to the important effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on PHEX expression in these bone-mineralizing cells. We have previously cloned ∼3000 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the murine PHEX gene and have shown that it is sufficient to drive reporter gene expression in UMR-106 rat, osteoblast-like, osteosarcoma cells (25Hines E.R. Collins J.F. Ghishan F.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We thus undertook the current investigation to verify that 1,25(OH)2D3 represses both PHEX expression and mineralization, and to determine the molecular mechanism by which 1,25(OH)2D3 decreases PHEX expression. To this end, we examined the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on PHEX mRNA levels in mice, and on the expression and stability of PHEX mRNA in UMR-106 cells. Reporter gene assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were used to identify and characterize the PHEX promoter region involved in 1,25(OH)2D3 regulation of gene expression. Our results demonstrate a novel 1,25(OH)2D3 transcriptional regulatory mechanism involving VDR-mediated repression of an unidentified transacting factor(s) that binds to a polyadenine element in the 5′-flanking region of the murine PHEX gene. Our data further indicate that this transfactor is required for optimal transcriptional initiation of the PHEX gene. Experimental Animals—4–5-week-old male C57BL/6 mice in groups of 3–4 were subcutaneously injected once with 1,25(OH)2D3 (Sigma) at a dosage of 6 μg/kg b.w. or with an equal volume of vehicle (1:4, ethanol:propylene glycol) (26Xu H. Bai L. Collins J.F. Ghishan F.K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C487-C493Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Animals were supplied with food and water ad libitum. The mice were sacrificed 24 h after injection by CO2 narcosis followed by cervical dislocation. Calvaria were removed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C. Chemicals and Reagents—10× TBE, 20× SSC, 100 mm sodium pyruvate, 100× antibiotic-antimycotic, restriction enzymes, Superscript II, 6% DNA retardation gels, dNTPs, random hexamers, TRIzol reagent, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). DME high glucose medium and fetal bovine serum were from Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA). [α-32P]dATP and [γ-32P]ATP were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Taq polymerase was from Continental Laboratory Products (San Diego, CA). DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). PHEX and 18 S Taqman primer/probe sets, and TaqMan universal PCR master mix were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Streptavidin MagneSphere Paramagnetic Particles (SA-PMP) and polynucleotide kinase were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Gels and reagents for SDS-PAGE were from Bio-Rad. All other reagents, unless otherwise indicated, were purchased from Fisher Scientific or Sigma. Northern Blot Analyses—Total RNA was prepared from mouse calvaria or UMR-106 cells using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. 10 μg of total RNA were fractionated on a 1% formaldehyde gel and downward transferred to a Zeta-Probe GT nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). Antisense PHEX and GAPDH radiolabeled, single-stranded DNA probes were generated using the PCR EZ strip kit (Ambion; Austin, TX). The PHEX probe was synthesized using PHEX reverse primer 5′-TGTCATGTTCAGCTCGAGAG-3′, with a mouse PHEX cDNA template from –816 bp to –1443 bp (97% homology between mouse and rat) (GenBank™ accession number NM_011077), and [α-32P]dATP. The GAPDH probe was synthesized using GAPDH reverse primer 5′-CAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCA-3′, with a mouse GAPDH DNA template from –1060 bp to –1635 bp (GenBank™ accession AF106860), and [α-32P]dATP. Membranes were hybridized with radiolabeled probe and washed as previously described (19Hines E.R. Collins J.F. Jones M.D. Serey S.H. Ghishan F.K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283: F356-F363Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and then exposed to x-ray film (Pierce) at –70 °C. Resulting films were analyzed using a Bio-Rad GS-700 Imaging Densitometer with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). PHEX hybridization band intensities were normalized for GAPDH hybridization band intensities on the same membrane. Experiments were repeated three times with different groups of mice or with cells grown at different times. Real-time PCR—10 μg of total RNA were treated with DNase I according to the DNA free kit protocol (Ambion). The resulting RNA was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis and concentrations were adjusted according to densitometric analysis of the 18 S rRNA band. 250 ng of DNase I-treated RNA were reverse-transcribed using Superscript II and random primers (Invitrogen; according to the manufacturer's protocol). Subsequently, 20-μl PCR reactions were set up in 96-well plates containing 10 μl of TaqMan universal PCR master mix, 1 μl of TaqMan primer/probe set, 2 μl of cDNA synthesis reaction (out of a 20-μl total volume), and 7 μl of molecular grade water. Reactions were run and analyzed on a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR detection system. Cycling parameters were determined, and resulting data were analyzed according to ABI protocols. Briefly, data were analyzed using the comparative Ct method as means of relative quantitation, normalized to an endogenous reference (18 S ribosomal RNA) and relative to a calibrator (normalized CT value obtained from vehicle-treated UMR-106 cells or mice) and expressed as 2–ΔΔCT according to Applied Biosystems User Bulletin 2: Rev B Relative Quantitation of Gene Expression. Reporter Gene Constructs—Progressive promoter deletions, with the same 3′-ends, were generated between –1064 and –133 bp of the PHEX promoter (25Hines E.R. Collins J.F. Ghishan F.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) by PCR, and cloned into pαGal-Basic (Clontech; Palo Alto, CA) as previously described (25Hines E.R. Collins J.F. Ghishan F.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A poly(A) deletion construct was generated by two step PCR using primers with the polyadenine region deleted, forward 5′-CTTCGTCTTCCTGTTCCAGTCCAAACC-3′ reverse 5′-GGTTTGGACTGGAACAGGAAGACGAAG-3′, as previously described (19Hines E.R. Collins J.F. Jones M.D. Serey S.H. Ghishan F.K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283: F356-F363Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the resulting PCR product was cloned into pαGal-Basic. All promoter/reporter gene constructs were sequenced to confirm fidelity. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Rat osteogenic sarcoma cells (UMR-106) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-1661) and were cultured in DME high glucose media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For analysis of endogenous PHEX gene expression, cells were seeded on 100-mm plates at 2 × 106 cells per plate, and treated with 10–7m 1,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle 48 h post-seeding. Where indicated, 1 μg/ml of actinomycin D (Calbiochem; San Diego, CA) was added 30 min prior to 1,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle treatment and continued throughout the treatment period. For transfection experiments, cells were seeded onto 24-well plates (62,500 cells/well), and each well was transfected with 0.3 μg of reporter vector DNA using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI). 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with 10–7m 1,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle, and 48 h later, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then frozen at –70 °C. For cotransfections, 0.6 μg of empty pSG5 vector or dominant-negative human vitamin D receptor (DNVDR)-expressing vector (27Jurutka P.W. Hsieh J.C. Remus L.S. Whitfield G.K. Thompson P.D.

Cell extracts were assayed for α-galactosidase activity using the Galacto-Star α-galactosidase reporter gene assay system (Tropix; Bedford, MA). Protein concentrations for each transfection were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Promoter activity is expressed as α-galactosidase activity per microgram of protein. In each experiment, the results from three wells for 24-well plates or from two 100-mm plates were averaged and considered as n = 1. Analysis of in vitro mineralization was performed as described by Hale et al. (28Hale L.V. Ma Y.F. Santerre R.F. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2000; 67: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded at 3 × 104 cells per well in 6-well plates and cultured as described above, supplemented with 10 mm α-glycerophosphate and 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid. Three days after seeding, cells were treated with 10–7m 1,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle. Media containing 1,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle were changed every 48 h. After 24, 48, or 72 h of treatment, these media were replaced with media containing 1 μg of calcein and incubated an additional 4 h. For analysis of bound calcein, cells were washed three times with calcium-magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline, overlaid with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and fluorescence was read on a Fluorskan Ascent FL plate reader (Labsystems; Helsinki, Finland) (excitation 485 nm, emission 527 nm). EMSA—Nuclear protein (N.P.) for EMSA was prepared from UMR-106 cells as previously described (29Slomiany B.A. Kelly M.M. Kurtz D.T. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 938-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Double-stranded, synthetic oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP. For each reaction, 50,000 dpm of probe were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 2.5 μg of nuclear protein, 4 μl of 5× binding buffer (125 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 500 mm KCl, 20% Ficoll, 25 μm ZnCl2) (29Slomiany B.A. Kelly M.M. Kurtz D.T. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 938-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), 1 μg of poly(d(I-C)) (Sigma), and H2O to a final volume of 20 μl. For competition studies, 100× cold probe was also added to the reaction. For EMSA with purified human VDR (hVDR) and human retinoid X receptor α (hRXRα) (30Hsieh J.C. Nakajima S. Galligan M.A. Jurutka P.W. Haussler C.A. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), 100 ng of hVDR and 100 ng of hRXRα were substituted for nuclear protein, and 1,25(OH)2D3 was added to a final concentration of 10–7m. Subsequently, 5 μl of DNA loading buffer (0.25× TBE, 60%; glycerol, 40%; bromphenol blue, 0.2% (w/v)) were added, and the reaction was loaded on a 6% DNA retardation gel (Invitrogen) and electrophoresed at 250 volts in 0.5× TBE. Gels were dried and then exposed to x-ray film (Pierce) at –70 °C. Oligonucleotides used for EMSAs are described below in Fig. 6. Southwestern Blot Analysis—Nuclear protein was prepared as described above for EMSA, and was fractioned on 7.5% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immobilized proteins were then renatured overnight at room temperature in 1× EMSA buffer containing 5% nonfat, dried milk. Blots were then washed for 15 min three times with 1× EMSA buffer with 5% milk. Blots were then incubated overnight at room temperature with rocking, in the presence of 1× EMSA buffer containing 5% milk and 1 × 107 dpm of 32P end-labeled DNA probe. Following hybridization, blots were washed three times for 15 min in 1× EMSA buffer and then exposed to x-ray film. DNA Affinity Protein Enrichment—A probe corresponding to –134 to –85 bp of the PHEX promoter region was generated by annealing a 5′ biotin-labeled –134/–85 GS oligonucleotide (see Fig. 6) with an unlabeled complementary oligonucleotide. 200 μl of Streptavidin Magne-Sphere® Paramagnetic Particles (SA-PMPs) were separated from storage buffer in a magnetic field, and storage buffer was removed. SA-PMPs were resuspended in 500 μl of 1× EMSA buffer. 10 nm biotinylated probe and 1 mg of bovine serum albumin were added to the SA-PMPs, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature with rotation for 1 h. 16 μg of UMR-106 nuclear protein were then added to the reaction and incubated 1 h at room temperature with rotation. Following incubation, SA-PMPs were separated from supernatant in a magnetic field, the supernatant was removed, and SA-PMPs were resuspended in 1× EMSA buffer. This washing procedure was repeated twice. After washing, SA-PMPs were resuspended in 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing α-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and the supernatant was electrophoresed on a 7.5% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained overnight with SYPRO Ruby (Molecular Probes; Eugene, OR) and subsequently destained for 30 min according to the manufacturer's protocol. Gels were then scanned to provide digital images (Bio-Rad FX Molecular Imager®). Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by the Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by Fisher's PLSD, using the Statview software package version 4.53 (SAS Institute; Cary, NC). Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Repression of PHEX Expression and Inhibition of Mineralization by 1,25(OH)2D3 in UMR-106 Osteoblast-like Cells—The PHEX gene has previously been shown by Ecarot and Desbarats (21Ecarot B. Desbarats M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to be down-regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 in both primary mouse osteoblasts isolated from calvaria and in the clonal, murine preosteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1, upon differentiation. We first determined whether the endogenously expressed PHEX gene was similarly repressed by 1,25(OH)2D3 in rat UMR-106 cells (25Hines E.R. Collins J.F. Ghishan F.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of UMR-106 cells treated with 10–7m 1,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle revealed a time-dependent decrease in PHEX mRNA expression, with a maximal decrease of ∼75% after 48 h of treatment (Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, real-time PCR analysis of the same RNA used for Northern blot analysis displayed virtually identical decreases in PHEX mRNA expression at 24, 48, and 72 h of 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment (Fig. 1C), i.e. significant repression at 24 h and a near maximal decrease at 48 h. The potential biological relevance of 1,25(OH)2D3 down-regulation of PHEX in UMR-106 cells was investigated by assessing the effect of the sterol hormone on mineralization. As seen in Fig. 2, the mineralization of cultured UMR-106 osteoblasts is dramatically attenuated by treatment of the cells with 10–7m 1,25(OH)2D3, to ∼80% by 72 h. The temporal association between PHEX repression (Fig. 1) and inhibition of mineralization at 24–72 h by 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 2) suggests, but does not prove, that the repression of PHEX endopeptidase activity results in higher effective concentrations of phosphatonin to in turn inhibit mineralization. Thus, UMR-106 cells are a biologically valid osteoblast model in which to investigate PHEX regulation, and we have previously shown that the murine PHEX promoter is active when transfected into these cells (25Hines E.R. Collins J.F. Ghishan F.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). 1,25(OH)2D3 Suppression of PHEX mRNA Expression in Mouse Calvaria—In order to demonstrate the physiological relevance of 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated repression of PHEX gene expression, we next verified that the endogenous PHEX gene was also repressed by 1,25(OH)2D3 in mice, in vivo. 4–5-week-old mice were treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 (or vehicle) and then total RNA was isolated from calvaria. Real-time PCR analysis revealed an approximate 35% decrease in PHEX mRNA expression after 24 h of 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment (data not shown), which was similar to the decrease observed with 24 h of 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment of UMR-106 cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Furthermore, this in vivo decrease in PHEX mRNA expression is in agreement with the approximate 40% decrease in PHEX mRNA and protein expression reported by Brewer et al. (22Brewer A.J. Canaff L. Hendy G.N. Tenenhouse H.S. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: F739-F748Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in the tibia of 1,25(OH)2D3-treated rats. Therefore, both murine and rat PHEX genes are repressed by 1,25(OH)2D3 in bone, in vivo. Transcriptional Regulation of the PHEX Gene by 1,25(OH)2-D3—To determine whether the repression of PHEX by 1,25(OH)2D3, in vitro and in vivo, occurs at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, we assessed the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on PHEX mRNA transcript stability. UMR-106 cells were pretreated with actinomycin D, exposed to 1,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle, and then assayed for PHEX mRNA levels at various time points up to 24 h. Real-time PCR indicated no difference in the rate of PHEX mRNA degradation between 1,25(OH)2D3 and vehicl"

The initially transcribing complex is relatively unstable, releasing short abortive products. After synthesis of a minimal length of RNA (∼10–12 bases in the T7 system), RNA polymerases complete the transition to a processive (highly stable) elongation phase and lose the initial promoter contacts. The current study strongly supports a model for T7 RNA polymerase in which initial bubble collapse from position –4 to position +3 is responsible for initiating RNA displacement in the transition process. More specifically, collapse of the bubble from position –4 to position –1 indirectly and energetically facilitates the direct strand invasion offered by collapse at positions +1 to +3. Parallel work shows that promoter release, another key event occurring during this stage of transcription, begins after translocation to position +8 and is largely complete upon translocation to about position +12. The timing of promoter release agrees with the timing of initial bubble collapse determined by our previous fluorescence studies, suggesting that these two events are closely related.

After synthesis of a minimal transcript length, RNA polymerases complete the transition to a processive (highly stable) elongation phase and release the initial promoter contacts. The single subunit phage T7 RNA polymerase carries out de novo transcription in a highly efficient manner, with key mechanistic features very similar to those of the structurally unrelated multi-subunit RNA polymerases (1McAllister W.T. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 385-391PubMed Google Scholar). The polymerase binds specifically to a small duplex DNA element within the promoter (from position –17 to position –5 relative to the start site), melts open the immediate downstream region to form an initial bubble of ∼7–8 base pairs, and begins transcription at the start site within the initial bubble (2Strothkamp R.E.

Biochemical studies of T7 RNA polymerase have provided mechanistic information on the process of promoter escape. When the RNA transcript is ∼2–8 nucleotides in length, the initially transcribing complex is relatively unstable and tends to release the transcript and restart transcription (6Milligan J.F.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3966-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This abortive cycle is a defining feature of the initiation phase of transcription (8Gralla J.D. Carpousis A.J.

In contrast to the initially transcribing complex, the elongation complex is highly stable, allowing transcripts to be extended over thousands of bases with little premature termination. Finally, within the elongation phase, transcription shows sequence-dependent termination, completing the synthesis of the RNA transcript (16Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 17Macdonald L.E. Zhou Y. McAllister W.T. J. Mol.

Crystal structures of an early initially transcribing complex (with a three-base transcript) and two elongation complexes provide abundant information on the initial and final states in the transition process (19Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 20Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A.

Comparing all three structures, it is seen that the conformation of the enzyme, in particular in the N-terminal region (residues 1–266), changes dramatically from an early initially transcribing complex to an elongation complex. The change in structure facilitates growth of a longer RNA-DNA hybrid (∼8 nucleotides), creates an RNA exit pathway, and disrupts the initial promoter binding region. This finding suggests that promoter release and initial RNA displacement are important in the transition process. Biochemical studies also provide insight into the transition from initiation to elongation in T7 RNA polymerase (11Mentesana P.E. Chin-Bow S.T. Sousa R. McAllister W.T. J. Mol.

Brieba L.G. Sousa R. Cell. 2002; 110: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Promoter release is thought to be required for the transition to elongation, and footprinting experiments have shown that initial promoter contacts are lost in translocation between positions +6 and +15 (22Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because there is some evidence that specific contacts with promoter bases around positions –9 and –5 are thought to be lost upon translocation to position +7 (23Place C. Oddos J. Buc H. McAllister W.T. Buckle M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4948-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the loss of the contact with promoter bases near position –17 might be the final signature of promoter release. Exonuclease footprinting experiments have shown that upon translocation to position +8 the entire DNA region from position –17 to position –5 becomes accessible for exonuclease digestion in some population (∼5–20%) of the complexes. Upon translocation to positions +9 and +10, the population increases to ∼40–90%, indicating that the contact around position –17 is absent or weak at this stage (26Brieba L.G. Sousa R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6826-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, these studies argue that promoter release occurs upon translocation beyond position +7. Fluorescence experiments demonstrate that the collapse of the initially melted DNA bubble occurs upon translocation beyond position +8 (13Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2725-2731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the size of the bubble increases from ∼7–8 base pairs in the initial promoter melting to ∼13 base pairs upon translocation to position +8 without any collapse at the upstream edge of the bubble. The upstream edge of the bubble begins to collapse upon translocation beyond position +8, and by the time the complex has reached position +15 (or sooner) the bubble has collapsed back to ∼8 base pairs (13Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2725-2731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Ma K. Temiakov D. Jiang M. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. J. Biol.

It seems logical that the initial bubble collapse would help to drive initial RNA displacement via direct strand invasion, and, indeed, initial RNA displacement has been shown to occur at about this point in translocation (13Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2725-2731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Promoter release, initial bubble collapse, and initial RNA displacement are likely associated with one another, accompanied by the conformational rearrangements of the enzyme in the final stage of the transition process. But the precise translocational timing of these three events, the relationship between them, and what movement of the enzyme drives or facilitates them remain elusive. Various results provide important insight into their relationship. Avoiding initial bubble collapse by removing or altering the relevant nontemplate DNA (by creating partially single-stranded, mismatched, or nicked constructs) impairs RNA displacement, resulting in an increase in 11–13-mer products during normal runoff transcription (7Martin C.T. Muller D.K. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3966-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12Jiang M. Rong M. Martin C. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Results from similar partially single-stranded DNA constructs suggested the formation of an extended RNA-DNA hybrid in complexes stalled at position +13 (29Gopal V. Brieba L.G. Guajardo R. McAllister W.T. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 411-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, the 11–13-mer products seen during the above runoff experiments likely arise from improper initial RNA displacement. The possibility that improper RNA displacement could limit forward translocation is also suggested in the mismatched bubble elongation complex models. On different nucleic acid scaffolds without complementarity in the nontemplate strand within the template-RNA hybrid region, efficient elongation of the RNA primers is possible but is limited to only 3–5 bases (30Daube S.S. von Hippel P.H. Science. 1992; 258: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 31Temiakov D. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47035-47043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), suggesting that without the assistance of DNA annealing at the upstream edge of the bubble, the polymerase has difficulty in properly initiating the process of RNA displacement. This interpretation is strengthened by a recent study in which a scaffold was generated containing a complementary nontemplate strand (32Jung Y. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52084-52092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this case, bubble collapse and displacement of the upstream end of the RNA should be near normal, and the assembled complexes experience no limitation in elongation. In the current study, our first goal is to address the relationship between initial bubble collapse and initial RNA displacement and to understand their importance in the transition process. Paralleling earlier studies (7Martin C.T. Muller D.K. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3966-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12Jiang M. Rong M. Martin C. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Gopal V. Brieba L.G. Guajardo R. McAllister W.T. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 411-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), different DNA constructs were used in a transcription assay to investigate the importance of the nontemplate region of the DNA in initial RNA displacement. The results suggest that reannealing of the DNA from position –4 to position +3 is important for proper displacement of the 5′-end of the RNA. The second goal is to determine the timing of promoter release using a sink challenge assay (33Diaz G.A. Rong M. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10837-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). By allowing transcription to stall at every translocational position from position +6 to position +15, we show that promoter release begins upon translocation beyond position +8 and is largely complete upon translocation to position +12. Protein Expression and Purification—His-tagged wild type T7 RNA polymerase was prepared from Escherichia coli strain BL21 carrying the plasmid pBH161 (kindly supplied by William T. McAllister) and purified using a Qiagen nickel-nitrilotriacetic column (34He B. Rong M. Lyakhov D. Gartenstein H. Diaz G. Castagna R. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Protein purity was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. The purified protein was concentrated and dialyzed against 20 mm KH2PO4-K2HPO4, 50% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.8; the concentration was calculated from the measured absorbance at 280 nm using the molar extinction coefficient of 1.4 × 105m–1 cm–1, dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the sample was then stored at –20 °C. Activity was determined by the transcription assay described below. Oligonucleotide Synthesis and Purification—DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized trityl-off using an Applied Biosystems Expedite 8909 DNA synthesizer, purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, excised from the gel, and eluted using an Elu-Trap® device (Schleicher and Schuell Inc.). Concentrations of single-stranded DNAs were calculated using the weight sums of the three different measured molar extinction coefficients for each base at 253, 259, and 267 nm (35Schick C. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4275-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNAs were stored in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, and 1 mm EDTA) at –20 °C. Partially Single-stranded or Double-stranded DNA Construction— Nontemplate DNA and the relevant template DNA strands were combined in equal molar concentrations, heated to 75 °C, and then cooled slowly (about 2 h) to room temperature for annealing. Annealed DNA constructs were stored in TE buffer at –20 °C. Transcription Assays—Transcription reactions were carried out in a total volume of 16 μl at 37 °C for 5 min before being quenched with an equal volume of formamide stop solution (95% formamide, 40 mm EDTA, and 0.02% bromphenol blue). Equal molar concentrations of DNA construct and enzyme were used at final concentrations of 0.125 μm in a reaction buffer containing 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 15 mm magnesium acetate, 25 mm potassium glutamate, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Tween 20. Reactions were initiated by the addition of NTPs to a final concentration of 400 μm each and labeled with [α-32P]GTP. RNA transcripts were resolved by 20% polyacrylamide and 7 m urea gel electrophoresis and visualized and quantified on a Storm Phosphor-Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Sink Challenge Assays—In these studies, reactions were carried out as those described above for 1 min before the addition of the sink. Buffer conditions and concentrations of DNA and enzyme before the addition of the sink were the same as described above. Reactions were initiated by the addition of GTP, ATP, and CTP to a final concentration of 400 μm each. After allowing transcription (in the absence of radiolabel) for 1 min, 2 μl of TE buffer containing 20 μm sink DNA and [α-32P]ATP was added. The reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of formamide stop solution 1 min after the addition of the sink. RNA transcripts were resolved, visualized, and quantified as described above. The following experiments address the interrelationship between three fundamental events in transcription, i.e. initial displacement of the 5′-end of the RNA, collapse of the upstream edge of the initial transcription bubble, and release of specific protein-promoter contacts. The transcription bubble in T7 RNA polymerase begins as a 7–8 base pair bubble and grows to ∼12–13 base pairs as the initially transcribing complex synthesizes up to a 7–8-base RNA (13Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2725-2731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The following explores the relationship between the initial collapse of the upstream edge of the bubble and the displacement of the 5′-end of the nascent RNA transcript. By analogy to the deficiencies in the elongation of scaffold or mismatched bubble elongation complexes, analysis of the results presented below uses the premature release of 11–13-mer RNA products as a sign of improper initial RNA displacement. More specifically, the molar ratio of 11–13-mer to 11–20-mer products is taken to assess the initial RNA displacement. Of the complexes that have successfully extended past position +10, this ratio represents the fraction that terminates prematurely at positions +11 to +13. Partially Single-stranded Constructs—To address the relationship between initial bubble collapse (upstream DNA reannealing) and initial RNA displacement, a set of partially single-stranded DNA constructs was designed for comparison with the control DNA construct (fully double-stranded) in a transcription assay. All DNA constructs encode the identical runoff 20-mer RNA. As shown in Table I, partially single-stranded DNA constructs were prepared in which the nontemplate strand extends from position –22 upstream (in all constructs) to positions ranging from –5 to +3 downstream (constructs PSS[–5] to PSS[+3]). It is expected that constructs lacking nontemplate strand bases at positions where collapse is critical to invasion-mediated displacement of the 5′-end of the RNA will be impaired in RNA displacement. As the critical nontemplate strand bases are restored, RNA displacement will be restored.Table IPartially single-stranded DNA transcripts Open table in a new tab The results presented in Fig. 1 show that in a construct containing the nontemplate strand downstream only to position –5, 11–13-mer products are substantially increased relative to transcription from the fully double-stranded control, which is consistent with previous results (12Jiang M. Rong M. Martin C. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The data in lanes 1–5 of Fig. 1 show that as the nontemplate strand is extended from position –5 to position –1, the accumulation of 11–13-mer products remains at high levels (>4-fold above native levels). Collapse in this region is not expected to compete directly with RNA in the heteroduplex. As the nontemplate strand is lengthened downstream to positions +2 and +3, the levels of 11–13-mer products drop to near those of the double-stranded control (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8), demonstrating that the reannealing of the DNA bases from position –5 to position +3 is sufficient for proper initial RNA displacement. Extension of the nontemplate strand farther downstream does not alter the levels of 11–13-mer products. 1P. Gong and C. T. Martin, unpublished results. More importantly, the molar ratio of 11–13-mer to 11–20-mer products mirrors these trends, confirming that premature termination at positions +11 to +13, a property of complexes lacking the nontemplate strand, is fully rescued by extension of the nontemplate strand to only position +2. Mismatched Bubble Constructs—To confirm the generality of the results from the partially single-stranded constructs, a set of DNA constructs was designed, each containing a window of four mismatched bases with the window centered at various positions from –4 to +20 (Table II; constructs MM[–4,–1] to MM[+16, +20]).Table IILocalized mismatch-containing DNA constructs Open table in a new tab Constructs with the mismatched bases in the initially melted region, MM[–4,–1] and MM[+1, +4], both give high ratios (∼3-fold above the native level) of 11–13-mer to 11–20-mer products (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3), indicating an impairment in RNA displacement. The results for the MM[+1, +4] construct are consistent with a model in which bubble collapse from position +1 to position +3 is essential. The observation that a construct with a mismatch bubble from position –4 to position –1 also yields high levels likely reflects that the reannealing of bases in the –4 to –1 region cooperatively facilitates reannealing of the DNA from position +1 to position +3. As the mismatched region is moved downstream as seen in constructs MM[+5, +8] and MM[+9, +12], the ratio of 11–13-mer to 11–20-mer products is less than that observed for mismatches around the start site and close to that of fully duplex DNA (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5), indicating that on these constructs RNA displacement proceeds with a minimal disturbance. As expected, mismatching of the region farthest downstream, as in construct MM[+17, +20], brings the ratio of 11–13-mer to 11–20-mer products to the native level (Fig. 2, lane 6). Together with the results from the partially single-stranded constructs, we conclude that reannealing of the DNA in the initially melted region (from position –4 to position +3) is the primary determinant for proper initial RNA displacement. Energetic Cooperativity in Bubble Collapse—The data presented in Fig. 1 suggest that the reannealing of the DNA bases at position +2 has the largest impact on the production of 11–13-mer products. In particular, the ratio of 11–13-mer to 11–20-mer products drops the most for the extension of the nontemplate strand from position +1 to position +2. Based on this observation, we expect that the reannealing of the DNA at this position and the positions immediately upstream (positions +1 and –1) is most critical for proper RNA displacement. To test this assumption, a set of DNA constructs was designed containing single or double base pair mismatches as summarized in Table III. Introducing different adjacent two-base mismatches in this critical region results in the highest (∼3-fold above native level) ratios of 11–13-mer to 11–20-mer products (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, any single base mismatch in this region also leads to a high ratio (>2-fold above native level) of 11–13-mer to 11–20-mer products (Fig. 3, lanes 4–6). These results demonstrate that even a small weakening of bubble collapse in this region is sufficient to impair proper RNA displacement.Table IIIMismatches very near the start site Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Critical regions for proper RNA displacement. Transcription from constructs with mismatched bases in the proposed critical DNA region (lanes 2–6) is compared with that of control construct (lane 1). Transcription from constructs with mismatched bases and/or designed GC pairs (lanes 7–10) is compared with that from the control construct (lane 1). Construct nomenclature is that of Table III (a star denotes the position of the GC dinucleotide step). Transcripts are indicated as described in the legend of Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The strong effect of the single base mismatch at position –1 supports our earlier proposal that the reannealing of DNA immediately upstream of the initial RNA displacement site (+1) facilitates the strand invasion immediately downstream. To confirm that the collapse of bases from position –4 to position –1 helps the downstream collapse, another set of DNA constructs was designed. Mismatches at either positions –4/–3 or positions –2/–1 induce a high ratio of 11–13-mer to 11–20-mer products (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 9), implying that collapse of the bubble 1–4 bases upstream of the RNA facilitates its release. This appears to be a simple matter of energetics, however, in that the energetics can be restored by replacement of the adjacent AT pairs by GC pairs. Specifically, the construct MM[–4,–3]GC[–2,–1] shows near native ratios of 11–13-mer to 11–20-mer RNA products (Fig. 3, lane 8). Thus, collapse of the upstream edge of the initial bubble from position –4 to position –1 contributes to the overall driving force to facilitate collapse at positions downstream. Finally, replacement of the TA step at positions –2 and –1 by a GC step in an otherwise wild type construct leads to ratios of 11–13-mer to 11–20-mer products lower than those seen in the fully duplex wild type construct (Fig. 3, lane 10). Promoter release, initial bubble collapse, and initial RNA displacement are expected to be closely related to one another in translocational timing. The results presented here suggest that initial bubble collapse and, presumably, the consequent displacement of the 5′-end of the RNA from the initial hybrid are most critical for allowing the proper transition. But how is promoter release involved in this process? Is promoter release coupled to initial bubble collapse or initial RNA displacement or both? Determination of the translocational timing of promoter release would help to address these questions. The occurrence of promoter release was previously localized between translocational positions +7 and +15 by footprinting and UV photo cross-linking studies (22Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 23Place C. Oddos J. Buc H. McAllister W.T. Buckle M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4948-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Preventing promoter release by the introduction of a covalent cross-link between the polymerase and the –17 template base of the promoter DNA results in substantial accumulation of 12–13-mer products (36Esposito E.A. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; (DOI 10.1074/jbc.M407688200)Google Scholar), suggesting that promoter release likely happens or has to happen at some point before the complex steps to position +12 or +13. In an attempt to precisely determine the timing of promoter release, a set of DNA constructs derived from the T7 ϕ10 promoter was designed and is shown in Table IV. These constructs allow transcription to stall at every position from +6to +15 in the presence of only GTP, ATP, and CTP. In translocation of the complex to positions +6 and +7, the promoter has not been released (22Ikeda R.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3614-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 23Place C. Oddos J. Buc H. McAllister W.T. Buckle M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4948-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 4, if RNA dissociates but polymerase and DNA remain associated, the polymerase is then able to resume the starting conformation and start a second round of transcription without rebinding to the promoter. In this mode, the complex is resistant to the challenge of a competitive promoter sink (33Diaz G.A. Rong M. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K.

They have been shown to form a physical complex on the cell surface that responds directly to LPS. However, the functional region of TLR4 required for association with MD-2 and LPS responsiveness is poorly understood. To identify the region of TLR4, we created a series of mutants with deletions in the extracellular domain and examined their activities in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. A mutant with a 317-amino acid deletion from the membrane proximal region of TLR4 was capable of associating with MD-2, while only a 9-amino acid truncation of the N terminus severely impaired the interaction. The association between the two molecules was well correlated with TLR4 maturation into an endoglycosidase H-resistant form and the cell surface expression. Mouse MD-2 bound to human TLR4, but its activity to facilitate the cell surface expression of TLR4 and confer LPS responsiveness was much weaker than that of human MD-2, indicating species specificity. A chimeric receptor composed of the N-terminal region of human TLR4 and the adjacent region of mouse TLR4 showed preference for human MD-2 in its transport to the cell surface and responsiveness to LPS.

Innate immunity is the first line of host defense in the mammalian immune system and is conserved among multicellular organisms from plants and insects to humans (1Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 295-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar, 2Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). While adaptive immunity responds to specific antigens, innate immunity recognizes certain molecular patterns specific to microorganisms, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), 1The abbreviations used are: PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; PRR, pattern recognition receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR, toll-like receptor; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; HEK, human embryonic kidney.1The abbreviations used are: PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; PRR, pattern recognition receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR, toll-like receptor; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; HEK, human embryonic kidney. via germ line-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Therefore, the recognition of PAMPs by PRRs underlies self/nonself discrimination by multicellular organisms. Despite the biological significance of PRRs, only limited information is currently available regarding the molecular mechanisms of PRRs for recognition of PAMPs and the subsequent activation of downstream mediators. In Drosophila, the crystal structure of peptidoglycan recognition protein, a PRR for peptidoglycan, has recently been determined (3Kim M.S. Byun M. Oh B.H. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms for activation of the protease cascade leading to induction of antimicrobial peptides and/or melanin formation remain to be determined. In another arthropod, horseshoe crabs, factor C and factor G, PRRs for the hemolymph coagulation cascade, are synthesized as serine protease zymogens and converted to active proteases upon binding to their target PAMPs, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and β-glucan, respectively (4Muta T. Iwanaga S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). While the tertiary structures of some LPS-binding proteins/peptides have been determined (5Kawano K.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3351-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), the crystal structures of factor C and factor G have not been solved. A growing body of evidence has indicated that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are central transducers for various PAMPs to invoke mammalian innate immunity (7Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar, 8Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38105-38108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). TLRs are type I transmembrane proteins with an extracellular domain composed of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and a cytoplasmic domain called the toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which shares similarity with that of the interleukin-1 receptor. Upon stimulation, a homotypic interaction(s) between the TIR domain of TLR and a cytosolic adaptor molecule(s) harboring a TIR domain leads to the activation of downstream signaling (8Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38105-38108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Activation of TLRs culminates in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and co-stimulatory molecules that induce acute inflammation or subsequent activation of the adaptive immune system. LPS, a major cell wall constituent of Gram-negative bacteria, is well known as one of the strongest elicitors of the innate immune system (9Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar).

TLR4 alone is not sufficient for the LPS signaling, and a secretory protein, MD-2, has also been identified as an essential component (18Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). MD-2 binds to the extracellular domain of TLR4 to form an active complex on the cell surface. Despite the established physiological roles for TLR4 and MD-2, biochemical characterization of LPS recognition by the TLR4·MD-2 complex remains obscure. While LPS binding to LPS-binding protein or CD14 was clearly detected (10Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W. Wright S.D. Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J.

Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3350) Google Scholar), efficient LPS binding to the TLR4·MD-2 complex expressed on cells has not been observed despite its capacity for LPS responsiveness. Nevertheless, several groups have attempted to reveal the molecular mechanisms for ligand recognition by the TLR4·MD-2 complex, although the results are controversial. Several LPS derivatives such as lipid IVA and Salmonella lipid A and a plant-derived antitumor agent, Taxol, act as TLR4 agonists on mouse cells, although they are inactive or antagonistic on human cells. In reconstitution experiments with TLR4 and MD-2 derived from the two species, the species-specific responses to these compounds are attributable to the origin of MD-2, indicating that MD-2 is directly involved in the recognition and discrimination of the TLR4 ligands (19Akashi S.

On the other hand, other groups have reported that the species-specific responses to lipid IVA or Rhodobacter sphaeroides lipid A are ascribed to the species of TLR4 (22Lien E. Means T.K. Heine H. Yoshimura A. Kusumoto S. Fukase K. Fenton M.J. Oikawa M. Qureshi N. Monks B. Finberg R.W. Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Clin.

Furthermore other studies have indicated that MD-2 binds to LPS and that the complex of MD-2 and LPS behaves as an active ligand for TLR4 (26Viriyakosol S. Tobias P.S. Kitchens R.L. Kirkland T.N. J.

While the biological significance of the TLR4·MD-2 complex in the LPS responses is becoming clear, little is known about the structure-function relationships of the ectodomain of TLR4. In the present study, as a first step toward understanding the mechanisms of TLR4 for recognizing LPS and transferring an activation signal downstream, we carried out molecular dissection of the extracellular domain of TLR4. We provide evidence that the amino-terminal region of TLR4 is a crucial determinant of its association with MD-2, which is essential for the cell surface expression of the receptor and hence the recognition of LPS. This is the first report to determine the functional region of TLR4 that associates with MD-2. Cells and Reagents—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 was purchased from List Biological Laboratories Inc. (Campbell, CA). Plasmids—The expression plasmids for human TLR4 have been described previously (17Muta T. Takeshige K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4580-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A cDNA for mouse TLR4 was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from RAW264.7 cells, and a fragment encoding its mature protein portion was subcloned into pFLAG-CMV-1 (Sigma). cDNAs for human and mouse MD-2 were obtained from THP-1 cells and RAW264.7 cells, respectively, and sub-cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with a carboxyl-terminal Myc tag. Truncated and chimeric mutants were created by polymerase chain reactions. pELAM1-Luc (29Irie T. Muta T. Takeshige K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and pRL-TK (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) were used as a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) reporter and an internal control reporter, respectively. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged TLR4 or its mutant (5 μg) with or without Myc-tagged MD-2 (5 μg) by the calcium phosphate method (30Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant with an empty vector. Two days after transfection, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, and 0.2 mm Na3VO4 supplemented with Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) on ice for 15 min. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2)-agarose (Sigma) or protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with an anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma) or released by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer under reducing conditions. In some experiments, the eluted samples were treated with endoglycosidase H (Endo H, Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were resolved by 10 or 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.), and probed with peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) or anti-c-Myc (9E10, Roche Diagnostics) monoclonal antibodies. Flow Cytometric Analyses—Cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged TLR4 or its mutants (2 μg) with or without Myc-tagged MD-2 (8 μg) by the calcium phosphate method (30Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant with an empty vector. Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin on ice for 30 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were stained with goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor® 488 (Invitrogen) on ice for 30 min. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur™, BD Biosciences). Luciferase Assay—HEK293 cells (1.5×105 cells/well) were plated in a 24-well plate and transfected with TLR4 (0.1 μg) with or without Myc-tagged human or mouse MD-2 (0.1 μg) together with the pELAM1-Luc reporter plasmid (0.125 μg) and pRL-TK control plasmid (0.05 μg) by the calcium phosphate method (30Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant with an empty vector. Two days after transfection, the cells were stimulated with or without 1 μg/ml LPS for 6 h, and their luciferase activities were measured using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corp.). The NF-κB reporter activity was divided by the activity of the Renilla control reporter to normalize the transfection efficiency. Data are shown as the mean ± S.E. of duplicate samples and are representative of two independent experiments. The Amino-terminal Region of TLR4 Is Essential for Association with MD-2—Since MD-2 stably associates with the extracellular domain of TLR4 (18Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar), we first analyzed the association between the two molecules. For efficient and specific immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, we utilized aminoterminally FLAG-tagged human TLR4 (17Muta T. Takeshige K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4580-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) in which the mature polypeptide of TLR4 (predicted to begin with amino acid 25) was preceded by the signal sequence of preprotrypsin and a FLAG epitope (Fig. 1A, Full-length). The FLAG-tagged TLR4 responded to LPS resulting in NF-κB activation, indicating that it was functionally active (data not shown). We cotransfected FLAG-tagged TLR4 or TLR2 and Myc-tagged MD-2 into HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated FLAG-TLR4 or FLAG-TLR2 with an anti-FLAG antibody. In contrast to TLR2, the transfected TLR4 appeared as two bands on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the upper band was slightly increased by coexpression of MD-2. The MD-2 coprecipitated with TLR4 was visualized by immunoblotting with an anti-Myc antibody. Consistent with previous reports (18Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar, 31Re F. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23427-23432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), MD-2 specifically coprecipitated with TLR4 but not with TLR2, indicating a specific association (Fig. 1B). The amount of MD-2 in the cell lysate was not altered by transfection of TLR4 or TLR2. To explore the functional region of TLR4, we constructed a series of human TLR4 mutants with deletions from the amino or carboxyl terminus of the extracellular domain (Fig. 1A). A small deletion of the first 3 amino-terminal amino acids (Δ25–27) did not affect TLR4 expression but significantly impaired its association with MD-2 (Fig. 1C). A further deletion (Δ25–33) completely abolished the association. On the other hand, mutant TLR4 molecules with large deletions in the carboxyl-terminal region of the extracellular domain (Δ314–637 and Δ321–637) were still capable of associating with MD-2. Truncations from the carboxyl-terminal region gradually diminished the association with MD-2. We also analyzed an internal deletion mutant of TLR4 (Δ151–175), and no association with MD-2 was observed (data not shown). Thus, the amino-terminal region of the extracellular region of TLR4 up to amino acid 320 is indispensable for the association with MD-2. The Amino-terminal Region of TLR4 Is Required for Its Cell Surface Expression—Nagai et al. (32Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) reported that transport of TLR4 to the cell surface is impaired in MD-2-deficient cells. A reconstitution experiment also showed that surface labeling of TLR4 is enhanced by expression of MD-2 (24da Silva Correia J. Soldau K. Christen U. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21129-21135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next analyzed the effect of the association between TLR4 and MD-2 on the cell surface expression of the receptor. FLAG-tagged TLR4 was transfected with or without MD-2, and the cell surface TLR4 was stained with an anti-FLAG antibody followed by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 2A). When FLAG-TLR4 alone was transfected, a histogram with the anti-FLAG antibody staining produced a right shoulder compared with the histogram for mock-transfected cells, indicating that a certain amount of TLR4 reached the cell surface. Coexpression of MD-2 resulted in a further right shift of the histogram, demonstrating enhancement of the surface expression of TLR4. On the other hand, mutants of TLR4, Δ25–33 and Δ300–637, that were unable to associate with MD-2 did not appear on the cell surface even when cotransfected with MD-2. In contrast to these mutants, the other mutants with the 3-amino acid deletion at the amino terminus (Δ25–27) and with the large deletion in the carboxyl-terminal region (Δ321–637) that were capable of associating with MD-2 were expressed on the surface, and this expression was further enhanced by cotransfection of MD-2. The lack of cell surface expression of the Δ25–33 and Δ300–637 mutants was not due to their degradation in the cells (Fig. 1C). A previous report showed that TLR4 accumulates in the Golgi apparatus in the absence of MD-2 (32Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). To analyze the intracellular transport of TLR4 from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane, we examined the sensitivity of the transfected TLR4 to Endo H treatment (Fig. 2B). Endo H treatment of the full-length TLR4 without MD-2 resulted in a shift of the main band to a lower molecular weight band, indicating that the full-length TLR4 contained Endo H-sensitive carbohydrate chains. Thus, it is strongly suggested that this molecular species enters the secretory pathway and is glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum but does not reach the medial Golgi compartment where the carbohydrate chains on glycoproteins are modified to Endo H-resistant forms. Coexpression of MD-2 increased the amount of the upper minor band, which was Endo H-resistant. Taken together with the results of the flow cytometric analyses, the band is likely to be the mature TLR4 on the cell surface. On the other hand, the Δ25–33 and Δ300–637 mutants, which were unable to bind to MD-2, were entirely sensitive to Endo H in the presence or absence of MD-2. The other mutants, Δ25–27 and Δ321–637, also exhibited an Endo H-sensitive band in the absence of MD-2. However, cotransfection of MD-2 with these mutants that could associate with MD-2 resulted in the generation of the Endo H-resistant molecular species. These results strongly suggest that the association of MD-2 with the amino-terminal region of TLR4 is required for the cell surface expression of the receptor. Both the Amino-terminal and the Carboxyl-terminal Regions of TLR4 Are Required for the LPS Responsiveness—We next measured the signaling capability of these mutants to examine whether the capacity of the TLR4 mutants to bind to MD-2 and to be delivered to the cell surface correlates with their LPS responsiveness. We transfected HEK293 cells with wild type or the mutants of TLR4 together with an NF-κB reporter plasmid. The transfected cells were stimulated with LPS, and the resulting reporter activity was measured (Fig. 3). The cells transfected with the full-length TLR4 responded to LPS as shown by elevated NF-κB reporter activity. As expected, the mutants that did not bind to MD-2 and therefore did not reach the cell surface (Δ25–33, Δ300–637, Δ307–637, and Δ314–637) barely responded to LPS. On the other hand, the amino-terminal deletion mutant (Δ25–27) with MD-2 binding capacity showed the LPS responsiveness. However, the other mutant (Δ321–637) acted as a constitutively active mutant that activated the signaling in the absence of the stimulation and did not exhibit the LPS responsiveness, although it retained the ability to bind to MD-2 (Fig. 1C). Species-specific Effect of MD-2 on the Surface Expression of TLR4—Several lines of evidence have suggested that species-specific cellular responses against LPS derivatives or Taxol can be attributed to the species of MD-2 (19Akashi S.

Qureshi N. Monks B. Finberg R.W. Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 23Poltorak A. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Citterio S. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2163-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to examine whether the activity of MD-2 to enhance the surface expression of TLR4 was also species-specific. We transfected human or mouse TLR4 together with MD-2 from either of the two species and analyzed the cell surface expression of TLR4 by flow cytometric analysis and the Endo H sensitivity assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, the surface expression of the full-length human TLR4 was specifically enhanced by human MD-2 but not by mouse MD-2. The Endo H sensitivity of the human TLR4 was not detectably affected by mouse MD-2, supporting the species specificity (Fig. 4B). In contrast to human TLR4, the cell surface expression of mouse TLR4 was similarly enhanced by either human or mouse MD-2. Consistent with these observations, both human and mouse MD-2 increased the Endo H-resistant form of mouse TLR4. The inability of mouse MD-2 to enhance the cell surface expression of human TLR4 was not attributed to a defect in its association with human TLR4 since mouse MD-2 efficiently associated with both human and mouse TLR4 (data not shown). A Chimeric Receptor with the Amino-terminal Region of Human TLR4 Collaborates with MD-2 in a Species-specific Manner—The different behaviors of human and mouse TLR4 stimulated us to analyze the sequences of the TLR4 ectodomain. Careful comparison of the amino acid sequences of human and mouse TLR4 revealed a less conserved region between the two molecules (amino acids 293–343 of human TLR4). To determine the region of TLR4 responsible for the species-specific collaboration with MD-2 in the transport of TLR4, we constructed a chimeric TLR4 molecule consisting of the aminoterminal portion of human TLR4 (amino acids 25–343) and the adjacent region of mouse TLR4 (amino acids 342–835) (Fig. 5A, NhCm). The chimera contained the region of human TLR4 required for association with MD-2. The cell surface expression of the chimeric TLR4 was preferentially enhanced by human MD-2 rather than mouse MD-2 in flow cytometric analyses (Fig. 5B). As expected, human MD-2, but not mouse MD-2, generated the Endo H-resistant form of TLR4, indicating facilitation of the transport to the cell surface (Fig. 5C). These results strongly suggest that the surface expression of TLR4 on HEK293 cells requires the complex formation between the amino-terminal region of TLR4 and MD-2. Species-specific Enhancement of TLR4 Surface Expression by MD-2 Is Essential for the LPS Signaling—Next we examined the effect of MD-2 on the activation of TLR4. Since TLR4-mediated cellular signaling culminates in activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, we measured NF-κB activity by reporter analysis. While the cells expressing human TLR4 alone responded weakly to LPS, cotransfection of human MD-2 dramatically enhanced the response as previously reported (Fig. 6) (18Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). The effect of MD-2 on human TLR4 was species-specific since mouse MD-2 did not enhance the LPS response at all. As expected from the transport analyses (Fig. 4), the LPS responsiveness of mouse TLR4 did not show species selectivity since both human and mouse MD-2 acted equally on mouse TLR4 to augment the LPS response (Fig. 6). The LPS signaling by the chimeric TLR4 (NhCm) was augmented by human MD-2 but not by mouse MD-2, similar to the results for its cell surface expression shown in Fig. 5. These results are consistent with the conclusion that the amino-terminal region of TLR4 forms a complex with MD-2, which is required for the intracellular transport of TLR4 to the cell surface, a prerequisite for the LPS signaling.

The importance of manganese in Rhodobacter capsulatus acetone carboxylase has been established through a combination of physiological, biochemical, and spectroscopic studies. Depletion of manganese from the R. capsulatus growth medium resulted in inhibition of acetone-dependent but not malate-dependent cell growth. Under normal growth conditions (0.5 μm Mn2+ in medium), growth with acetone as the carbon source resulted in a 4-fold increase in intracellular protein-bound manganese over malate-grown cells and the appearance of a Mn2+ EPR signal centered at g = 2 that was absent in malate-grown cells. Acetone carboxylase purified from cells grown with 50 μm Mn2+ had a 1.6-fold higher specific activity and 1.9-fold higher manganese content than cells grown with 0.5 μm Mn2+, consistently yielding a stoichiometry of 1.9 manganese/α2β2γ2 multimer, or 0.95 manganese/αβγ protomer. Manganese in acetone carboxylase was tightly bound and not removed upon dialysis against various metal ion chelators. The addition of acetone to malate-grown cells grown in medium depleted of manganese resulted in the high level synthesis of acetone carboxylase (15–20% soluble protein), which, upon purification, exhibited 7% of the activity and 6% of the manganese content of the enzyme purified from acetone-grown cells. EPR analysis of purified acetone carboxylase indicates the presence of a mononuclear Mn2+ center, with possible spin coupling of two mononuclear sites. The addition of Mg·ATP or Mg·AMP resulted in EPR spectral changes, whereas the addition of acetone, CO2, inorganic phosphate, and acetoacetate did not perturb the EPR. These studies demonstrate that manganese is essential for acetone carboxylation and suggest a role for manganese in nucleotide binding and activation.

Despite more than 60 years of research on the subject and direct evidence for enzymatic conversion of acetone to acetoacetate and acetol, the physiological significance of acetone metabolism in mammals remains unclear (2Argilés J.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 61-65Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Kalapos M.P. Med. Hypotheses. 1999; 53: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The role of acetone metabolism in bacteria is more clearly defined, in that a variety of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria are able to grow using acetone as their primary source of carbon and energy (14Ensign S.A. Small F.J. Allen J.R. Sluis M.K. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 169: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Despite some early evidence suggesting that acetol is an intermediate in aerobic acetone metabolism by some bacteria (4Taylor D.G. Trudgill P.W. Cripps R.E. Harris P.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1980; 118: 159-170Google Scholar, 6Lukins H.H. Foster J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1963; 85: 1074-1087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Vestal J.R. Perry J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 99: 216-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it now appears that carboxylation of acetone to acetoacetate is the primary, if not only, reaction by which both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria initiate acetone catabolism (14Ensign S.A. Small F.J. Allen J.R. Sluis M.K. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 169: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Acetone carboxylation by bacteria has been studied extensively in cell suspensions and extracts of diverse bacteria (3Sluis M.K. Small F.J. Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J.

Recently, acetone carboxylases (EC 6.4.1.6) have been purified and characterized from two bacteria: Xanthobacter autotrophicus, an aerobic α-proteobacterium, and Rhodobacter capsulatus, a purple nonsulfur photosynthetic bacterium (23Sluis M.K. Ensign S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8456-8461Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Sluis M.K. Larsen R.A. Krum J.G. Anderson R. Metcalf W.W. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The acetone carboxylases from the two bacteria had nearly indistinguishable biochemical properties, consisting of three subunits of 85, 79, and 20 kDa arranged in a α2β2γ2 quaternary structure (23Sluis M.K. Ensign S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8456-8461Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Sluis M.K. Larsen R.A. Krum J.G. Anderson R. Metcalf W.W. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The purified enzymes did not contain or require biotin. Purified preparations of the enzymes contained significant quantities of manganese, zinc, and iron, with manganese being present in the highest quantity (1.3–1.5 mol of manganese/mol of α2β2γ2 protomer) (23Sluis M.K. Ensign S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8456-8461Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Sluis M.K. Larsen R.A. Krum J.G. Anderson R. Metcalf W.W. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The enzymes also exhibited identical catalytic and kinetic properties, catalyzing the ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetone to acetoacetate according to Reaction 1 (23Sluis M.K. Ensign S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8456-8461Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Sluis M.K. Larsen R.A. Krum J.G. Anderson R. Metcalf W.W. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).CH3COCH3+CO2+ATP→CH3COCH2COO−+H++AMP+2Pi(Eq. 1) The formation of AMP and two inorganic phosphates as ATP hydrolysis products is unprecedented for all other carboxylase reactions known.For both bacteria, the genes encoding the acetone carboxylase subunits are arranged in operons consisting of the genes acxABC, which encode the β, α, and γ subunits of the enzyme, respectively (24Sluis M.K. Larsen R.A. Krum J.G. Anderson R. Metcalf W.W. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Whereas the amino acid sequences of the three subunits share very high identity with each other (70–84%), they are not homologous to any other carboxylases, including Rubisco and the biotin-dependent carboxylases (24Sluis M.K. Larsen R.A. Krum J.G. Anderson R. Metcalf W.W. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In fact, the only enzymes that share significant identity with acetone carboxylase are hydantoinases, which show 15–30% identity with the α and β subunits of acetone carboxylase (24Sluis M.K. Larsen R.A. Krum J.G. Anderson R. Metcalf W.W. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The γ subunit of acetone carboxylase does not share significant identity with any known enzyme.Together, the biochemical, kinetic, and molecular properties of acetone carboxylase suggest that it represents a fundamentally new class of carboxylase enzyme. Acetone carboxylation is thermodynamically unfavorable, and, not surprisingly, the reverse reaction, acetoacetate decarboxylation, occurs spontaneously in aqueous solution. One of the first enzymes to be studied in detail mechanistically was acetoacetate decarboxylase, which accelerates the spontaneous decomposition of acetoacetate to acetone and CO2 (25Westheimer F.H. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 231-241Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Acetoacetate decarboxylase does not share homology with acetone carboxylase, does not require a nucleotide cofactor, and is not capable of catalyzing the carboxylation of acetone. Thus, acetone carboxylation and acetoacetate decarboxylation are not freely reversible reactions and require distinctive strategies of catalysis.Given the lack of precedents for the acetone carboxylase reaction, we have begun to examine the cofactor requirements of the enzyme in order to gain insights into the catalytic mechanism. Particularly intriguing is the presence of significant quantities of manganese in the purified enzyme. Manganese is a cofactor for a number of enzymes but rarely remains tightly bound and associated with enzymes during purification. In the present study, the possible role of manganese in acetone carboxylase has been probed by a combination of physiological, biochemical, and spectroscopic studies. The results demonstrate that manganese is a required and stoichiometric cofactor of acetone carboxylase and provide insights into the nature of the manganese center and possible roles of the metal ion in catalysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMedia, Growth of Bacteria, and Preparation of Cell Extracts—R. capsulatus strain B10 (ATCC 33303) (26Madigan M.T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 71: 281-286Crossref Google Scholar) was grown photoheterotrophically at 30 °C using the media and growth conditions described previously (24Sluis M.K. Larsen R.A. Krum J.G. Anderson R. Metcalf W.W. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Concentrated stock solutions of medium components, minus divalent metal salts, were passed over a column (5 × 100 cm) of Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad) to deplete the media of adventitious metals. All glassware was washed with 1 m HNO3 prior to use. The appropriate metal salts were then added to complete the media. Where indicated, manganese was either omitted or included in the medium formulation. Large scale cultivations were performed in a 45-liter capacity illuminated glass vessel as described previously (24Sluis M.K. Larsen R.A. Krum J.G. Anderson R. Metcalf W.W. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For small scale cultivation, cultures were grown in a controlled temperature incubator with illumination provided by a combination of 15-watt fluorescent and 60-watt incandescent light bulbs. The cultures were grown in glass tubes (15 ml) sealed with red rubber stoppers (13 × 20-mm sleeve). The carbon sources for growth were acetone (40 mm) and/or malic acid (30 mm), and the source of inoculant was a late log phase culture of cells grown on the same medium. The optical density of the cultures was determined using a Klett-Summerson photoelectric colorimeter. The Klett colorimeter was standardized relative to a Shimadzu model UV-160 spectrophotometer for the conversion of Klett readings to absorbance values at 600 nm.Cultures grown in the 45-liter fermenter were harvested after reaching A600 values between 2.5 and 4.0 using an A/G Technologies polysulfone membrane cartridge filtration system. Concentrated cell suspensions were pelleted by centrifugation, washed once with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), repelleted, and stored at –80 °C. Frozen cell paste was resuspended in an equal volume of buffer A (25 mm MOPS, 1The abbreviations used are: MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; G, gauss; Rubisco, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) containing DNase I (0.03 mg/ml). Cell suspensions were passed three times through a chilled French pressure cell at 110,000 kilopascals and 4 °C. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C).Purification of Enzymes and Protein Characterization—Acetone carboxylase was purified as described previously (24Sluis M.K. Larsen R.A. Krum J.G. Anderson R. Metcalf W.W. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For purification of acetone carboxylase from manganese-depleted cultures, all buffers were treated with Chelex, and glassware was washed with HNO3 as described above. EDTA (1 mm) was included in the buffers for purification of manganese-depleted acetone carboxylase.SDS-PAGE (12% T, 2.7% C running gel) was performed in a Mini-Protean II apparatus (Bio-Rad) following the Laemmli procedure (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Proteins in gels were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. The standards used were β-galactosidase (116 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (35 kDa), restriction endonuclease Bsp981 (25 kDa), β-lactoglobulin (18 kDa), and lysozyme (14 kDa), purchased from Fermentas.Immunoblot analysis was conducted by electrophoretically transferring proteins from SDS-polyacrylamide gels onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with polyclonal antiserum raised against purified acetone carboxylase. Cross-reacting proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Promega).Acetone Carboxylase Assays—All assay buffers and glassware were depleted of trace metals as described above. Acetone carboxylase activity in purified protein samples was determined using gas chromatography as described previously (24Sluis M.K. Larsen R.A. Krum J.G. Anderson R. Metcalf W.W. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Allen J.R. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1469-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Spectroscopic Techniques—X- band EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker model ESP 300 spectrometer equipped with an ER 4116 DM dual mode X-band cavity and an Oxford Instruments ESR-900 helium flow cryostat. In all cases, calibrated 4-mm quartz EPR tubes (Wilmad, Buena, NJ) were used. Independently recorded background spectra of the cavity were aligned with and subtracted from experimental spectra. EPR spectra were recorded at a modulation frequency of 100 kHz and amplitude of 1.26 milliteslas (12.6 G) with a sweep rate of 10 milliteslas s–1. Spectra were recorded at microwave frequencies of ∼9.64 GHz, with the precise microwave frequencies noted for individual spectra to ensure exact g-alignment. A standard solution containing CuSO4 (1 mm) and EDTA (10 mm) was used for spin quantitation of the metal centers in protein samples.For EPR and metal analysis of cell lysates, samples were incubated with Chelex 100 for 10 min and then passed over a 1.5 × 5-cm column of Sephadex G-25 (PD-10; Amersham Biosciences), which had 1 cm of Chelex overlaid on the resin. The samples for EPR analysis were placed in serum vials and degassed on a vacuum manifold with repeated cycles of evacuation and flushing with argon. The samples were then placed into quartz tubes that had been flushed with argon and were frozen in liquid nitrogen.For EPR analysis of purified proteins, samples were treated with Chelex 100 followed by centrifugation (1000 × g) and decanting to remove the Chelex resin. Nucleotides, acetone, and other molecules were added to appropriate samples, followed by evacuation, flushing, and transfer to degassed EPR tubes as described above.Temperature Dependence of EPR Signals—Spectra were recorded at different temperatures using the conditions described above, except that the power was lowered to an optimal nonsaturating value (0.1 milliwatts). The relative peak heights for each signal were plotted versus temperature, and the data were fit to Curie law 1/T dependence according to Equation 1.S=k/T+x(Eq. 2) For this equation, S is the EPR signal intensity, k is an arbitrary constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, and x is a correction factor. The variations in constants were 3.1–4.0 for k and 0.11–0.35 for x.Analytical Procedures—Protein concentrations were determined by means of a modified Biuret assay (29Chromy V. Fischer J. Kulhanek V. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 1362-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Metal contents of protein samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission mass spectrometry at the Utah State University Veterinary Diagnostics Laboratory. All samples were treated with Chelex 100 as described above prior to performing metal analysis.RESULTSManganese Stimulates Acetone-dependent Growth of R. capsulatus—The acetone carboxylases from R. capsulatus and X. autotrophicus are essentially identical enzymes (24Sluis M.K. Larsen R.A. Krum J.G. Anderson R. Metcalf W.W. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Both enzymes are induced to high levels (17–25% of soluble proteins) upon the addition of acetone to actively growing cultures, and the induction is not inhibited by the presence of other carbon sources. X. autotrophicus metabolizes acetone under aerobic conditions, whereas R. capsulatus metabolizes acetone under anaerobic, photoheterotrophic conditions (26Madigan M.T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 71: 281-286Crossref Google Scholar). Since acetone is highly volatile, it is easier to control and quantify acetone-dependent growth in the contained, anaerobic conditions used to culture R. capsulatus. For this reason, R. capsulatus was chosen for the following physiological studies and as the source of acetone carboxylase for the subsequent spectroscopic analyses.The growth medium used to culture R. capsulatus contains 0.5 μm exogenously added MnCl2 (26Madigan M.T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 71: 281-286Crossref Google Scholar). To determine what effect manganese limitation might have on growth of R. capsulatus, MnCl2 was excluded from the growth medium, and the components of the growth medium were treated with Chelex 100 to remove adventitious manganese. As shown in Fig. 1, R. capsulatus grew poorly with acetone as the carbon source in the media lacking manganese. The doubling time of the manganese-depleted cells during log phase was ∼19% of the manganese-supplemented cells. It should be noted that a slight amount of manganese (0.75 nm MnCl2 based on 0.15% (v/v) inoculant size) was carried over from the manganese-supplemented inoculant used for this experiment. To determine whether manganese carryover contributed to the slow growth on manganese-depleted media, the cells at the 200-min time point were subcultured again into manganese-depleted media. Similar growth rates were observed, perhaps due to contamination of the media with traces of manganese that were not removed by Chelex treatment or limited functionality of a manganese-depleted form of the enzyme.In contrast to the results described above, there was little, if any, effect of manganese depletion on growth of R. capsulatus with malate as the carbon source, both in terms of doubling time and final cell density (Fig. 1). Additionally, manganese-depleted, malate-grown cells could be subcultured repeatedly on media lacking manganese with no apparent effect on growth rates or yields. Thus, manganese is required for optimal acetone-dependent, but not malate-dependent, growth of R. capsulatus.Acetone Carboxylase Is Synthesized in Manganese-depleted, Malate-grown Cells—R. capsulatus cells were grown with malate as the carbon source for several generations in the absence of manganese. As shown in Fig. 2, acetone carboxylase was not synthesized under these growth conditions. Upon the addition of acetone to the culture, acetone carboxylase was induced and synthesized at very high levels, despite the presence of malate and absence of added manganese in the growth medium. Thus, acetone carboxylase is inducible in R. capsulatus, not subject to negative regulation by the absence of manganese, and not subject to catabolite repression. These results are consistent with the previous observation that R. capsulatus acxABC is under the apparent control of a σ70-dependent transcriptional activator acxR (24Sluis M.K. Larsen R.A. Krum J.G. Anderson R. Metcalf W.W. Ensign S.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Electrophoretic and immunoblot analysis of acetone carboxylase synthesis in R. capsulatus.

To investigate this, metal analysis was performed on extracts prepared from cells grown with normal concentrations of manganese, either with acetone or malate as the carbon source. Before performing metal analysis, the extracts were treated with Chelex resin and desalted by gel filtration chromatography to remove free and loosely bound manganese, so the analyses should reflect only manganese bound tightly to cellular macromolecules. The results were as follows; an extract of acetone-grown cells contained 0.45 ppm manganese, whereas an extract of malate-grown cells with the same concentration of protein (5.5 mg protein/ml for this experiment) contained 0.11 ppm manganese. Thus, growth with acetone as the carbon source resulted in a 4-fold increase in the concentration of intracellular, protein-bound manganese.Extracts of the cells analyzed for manganese content were also analyzed by EPR spectroscopy in order to determine whether acetone carboxylase synthesis correlates with the appearance of a unique EPR signal that can be attributed to protein-bound manganese. As shown in Fig. 3, a six-line EPR spectrum centered at about 3500 G is visible in the extract from acetone-grown cells but not visible in the extract from malate-grown cells. This spectrum is clearly a manganese (II)-dependent signal, as indicated by the 6-fold hyperfine, with average distances of 86 G between adjacent features. As shown in the inset, a spectrum of aqueous MnCl2 obtained under the same conditions shows very little resolution of hyperfine features due to the anisotropic ligand environment of manganese hexahydrate. Thus, the hyperfine observed in the protein samples cannot originate from free manganese and must result from asymmetric protein-bound manganese.Fig. 3X-band EPR spectra of cell extracts of acetone-grown (a) and malate-grown (b) R. capsulatus. The samples were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Experimental conditions were as follows: temperature, 5.6 K; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 12.6 G; time constant, 81.92 ms; microwave frequency, 9.654 GHz; microwave power, 2.0 milliwatts. Inset, spectrum of 0.1 mm MnSO4 under identical conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Optimal Growth Conditions Result in Stoichiometric Manganese in Acetone Carboxylase—As noted above, the growth medium used to culture R. capsulatus contains 0.5 μm supplemental manganese. Based on the high level of synthesis of acetone carboxylase, it is conceivable that manganese becomes limiting if it is a preferred or essential metal ion for the enzyme. The concentration of acetone carboxylase (α2β2γ2 multimer) in a culture of R. capsulatus grown to an optical density of 6 and for which acetone carboxylase represents 20% of soluble proteins can be estimated to be ∼0.28 μm (based on the culture volume, not the intracellular concentration of protein). This concentration corresponds to 0.56 μm αβγ protomer, a number slightly higher than the concentration of added manganese. Thus, manganese is potentially limiting under these growth conditions if it is indeed a stoichiometric component of the enzyme.Table I shows the results of manganese supplementation and depletion on the metal contents and specific activities of purified acetone carboxylase preparations. Clearly, there is a positive correlation between manganese availability in the media, manganese content of the purified enzymes, and enzyme specific activity. The addition of 50 μm manganese to the growth medium resulted in the association of an average of 1.9 tightly bound manganese ions per α2β2γ2 multimer or 0.95 manganese per αβγ protomer. At the same time, the specific activity of the enzyme increased by 1.6-fold over the preparations purified from cells containing only 0.5 μm manganese in the media. Dialysis of acetone carboxylase against buffers containing 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm imidazole, or 25 mm 8-hydroxyquinoline did not result in the loss of manganese from the enzyme, nor did the treatments lower the activity of the enzyme.Table IMetal contents and activities of acetone carboxylase preparations from R. capsulatusAcetone carboxylase sourceaFor the preparation of manganese-depleted acetone carboxylase, it was necessary to have malate present as a carbon source to support bacterial growth (see Figure 1).Metal ion/α2β2γ2 multimerSpecific activityIronManganeseZincmol/molunits·mg-1Acetone-grown, +0.5 μm MnCl2< 0.011.01 ± 0.170.14 ± 0.050.165 ± 0.04Acetone-grown, +50 μm MnCl20.03 ± 0.031.90 ± 0.050.04 ± 0.020.234 ± 0.035Malate-grown with acetone present, no added MnCl20.4"
https://openalex.org/W1989158987,"The adenovirus E4orf4 protein induces p53-independent death of human cancer cells by a mechanism requiring interactions with the Balpha subunit of protein phosphatase 2A. When expressed alone E4orf4 localizes predominantly in the nucleus, although significant levels are also present in the cytoplasm. While tyrosine phosphorylation of E4orf4 and recruitment of Src have been linked with E4orf4 cytoplasmic cell death functions, little is known about the functions of E4orf4 in the nucleus. In this study, we identified an arginine-rich motif (E4ARM; residues 66-75) that is necessary and sufficient for nuclear and nucleolar localization. This motif, which is highly homologous to the arginine-rich nuclear and nucleolar localization motif of some lentiviral proteins, was shown to target heterologous proteins to the nucleus and to nucleoli, functions found to be dependent on the overall charge of the motif rather than on specific residues. Furthermore, mutation of arginine residues to alanines but not to lysines in E4ARM was shown to block such targeting activity and, when introduced into full-length E4orf4, to decrease induction of cell death. Finally, coexpression of the ARM motifs of E4orf4, HIV-1 Tat or Rev along with full-length E4orf4 was seen to decrease E4orf4-dependent cell killing. Thus it appears that targeting of E4orf4 to the nucleus and cell nucleoli by E4ARM is an important component of E4orf4-induced cell death."

FVa degradation by wild type (WT)-APC and QGNSEDY-APC yielded similar fragments on Western blotting; QGNSEDY-APC was, however, considerably more efficient. The kinetic parameters for individual APC-mediated cleavages in FVa, i.e. at Arg-306 and Arg-506, were investigated at high and low phospholipid concentrations in the presence and absence of protein S. FVa variants 306Q679Q and 506Q679Q, which can only be cleaved at Arg-506 and Arg-306, respectively, were used. In the absence of protein S, QGNSEDY-APC was 17.8- and 4-fold more efficient than WT-APC in cleaving at Arg-306 and Arg-506, respectively, at high phospholipid. Similar values were obtained at low phospholipid. In the presence of protein S, QGNSEDYAPC was 6.8- and 3.2-fold more active than WT-APC in cleaving at Arg-306 and Arg-506, respectively, at high phospholipid. At low phospholipid, the corresponding values were 14- and 6.5-fold. In conclusion, the modification of the Gla domain in QGNSEDY-APC yielded increased rates of cleavage at both sites in FVa, the increase being particularly pronounced for the Arg-306 site in the absence of protein S.

In conclusion, the modification of the Gla domain in QGNSEDY-APC yielded increased rates of cleavage at both sites in FVa, the increase being particularly pronounced for the Arg-306 site in the absence of protein S. The results obtained with QGNSEDY-APC provide insights into the importance of the APC-phospholipid interaction for the APC-mediated cleavages at Arg-306 and Arg-506 in FVa. Blood coagulation comprises a series of enzymatic reactions, many of which take place on negatively charged phospholipid membranes upon which enzymes and cofactors form highly efficient complexes (1Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 2Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S.

Several of the coagulation enzymes, e.g. factor IX (FIX), factor X (FX) and prothrombin, are vitamin K-dependent and thus contain a γ-carboxyl glutamic acid (Gla)-rich domain, which binds to negatively charged phospholipid (4Nelsestuen G.L. Trends Cardiovas. Med. 1999; 9: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).

The protein C anticoagulant pathway provides efficient and specific regulation of the coagulation system by inhibiting the activity of the two cofactors, FVIIIa and FVa (3Dahlback B.

Protein C, the key component of the pathway, is converted to activated protein C (APC) on the surface of endothelial cells by thrombin bound to the membrane protein thrombomodulin. The specific proteolysis of FVIIIa and FVa by APC is stimulated by protein S, which serves as an APC cofactor (9Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P.

Dahlback B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Protein C and protein S are both vitamin K-dependent proteins containing Gla domains that bind to negatively charged phospholipid surfaces upon which the two proteins form an anticoagulant complex (8Dahlback B. Stenflo J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Majerus P.W. Perlmutter R.M. Varmus H. The Molecular Basis of Blood Disease. 3rd Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA2001: 614-656Google Scholar). This complex is effective in cleaving and inhibiting FVa but is insufficient to down-regulate FVIIIa, which takes part in the tenase complex. In this reaction the APC-protein S complex is supported by yet another APC cofactor, namely the non-activated form of FV (12Shen L. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18735-18738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Varadi K.R.J. Tans G. Pabinger I. Keil B. Schwarz H.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, circulating FV has the potential to express both pro- and anticoagulant functions as a procoagulant FXa cofactor after activation by thrombin or FXa and as an anticoagulant APC cofactor (11Nicolaes G. Dahlback B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In FVa three peptide bonds at Arg-306, Arg-506, and Arg679 are sensitive to proteolysis by APC (14Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three cleavage reactions have distinct kinetic properties, a dependence on phospholipid, are differently stimulated by protein S, and yield FVa-inactivation intermediates with different FVa activities. The cleavage at Arg-506, which is kinetically favored, is not dependent on protein S and yields a FVa inactivation intermediate with decreased FXa-cofactor activity (14Kalafatis M.

The APC-mediated cleavage at Arg-306 is stimulated by protein S and results in almost complete inactivation of FVa (9Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Varadi K.

Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2091-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but the Arg-306 cleavage also leads to dissociation of the A2 domain, which is crucial for full loss of function (20Gale A.J. Xu X. Pellequer J.L. Getzoff E.D. Griffin J.H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2091-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Mann K.G. Hockin M.F. Begin K.J. Kalafatis M. J. Biol.

The cleavage at Arg-679 is not characterized in detail but is believed to be of minor importance for the inactivation of FVa (22Norstrom E. Thorelli E. Dahlback B. Blood. 2002; 100: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The dependence of phospholipid concentration and composition for each cleavage reaction has not been characterized in detail. Results on record, however, indicate that the cleavage at Arg-506 may occur in the absence of phospholipid, whereas the cleavage at Arg-306 is more dependent on the presence of phospholipid (14Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Norstrøm E. Steen M. Tran S. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24904-24911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the Gla domains of the different vitamin K-dependent proteins share a high degree of sequence similarity, their affinities for negatively charged phospholipid vary considerably (4Nelsestuen G.L. Trends Cardiovas. Med. 1999; 9: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23McDonald J.F. Shah A.M. Schwalbe R.A. Kisiel W. Dahlback B. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5120-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Protein S is one of the proteins with highest affinity for negatively charged phospholipid, whereas protein C belongs to the group having low affinity. It has been proven possible to modulate the affinity of protein C for the phospholipid by mutagenesis of the Gla domain and to obtain protein C variants with increased affinity for the membrane (24Shen L. Shah A.M. Dahlback B. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16025-16031Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Shen L. Shah A. Dahlback B. Nelsestuen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31086-31091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We recently described a protein C variant, QGNSEDY protein C, having increased phospholipid binding ability and enhanced anticoagulant efficiency as a result of multiple mutations in the Gla domain (26Sun Y.H. Shen L. Dahlback B. Blood. 2003; 101: 2277-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This protein C variant is a useful reagent for the elucidation of the importance of the interaction between the Gla domain of protein C and the phospholipid membrane in the degradation of FVa and FVIIIa and the mechanism by which protein S stimulates APC. In this study we have investigated the effect of QGNSEDY-APC on the individual cleavages at Arg-306 and Arg-506 in FVa using recombinant FV variants 306Q679Q and 506Q679Q that can only be cleaved at single APC-cleavage sites. Materials—BioTrace polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Pall Corp. (Ann Arbor, MI). Chromogenic substrates S-2238 and S-2366 were kindly provided by Chromogenix (Milano, Italy). l-α-Phosphatidylserine (PS) from brain and l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC) from egg were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Hirudin was from Pentapharm Ltd (Basel, Switzerland). Ovalbumin and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Human FXa and prothrombin were from Kordia (Leiden, Netherlands). Human protein S was purified from plasma as described (27Dahlback B. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (28Dahlback B. Wiedmer T. Sims P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12769-12777Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The AHV-5146 monoclonal anti-factor V antibody, which reacts with the heavy chain of FVa, was from Hematologic Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). The HV-1 monoclonal antibody against the light chain of FVa was from Sigma-Aldrich. A monoclonal antibody against the B domain of FV (MK30) is previously described (29Dahlback B. Hildebrand B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The HV-1 and MK30 monoclonal antibodies were biotinylated using biotin amido caproate N-hydroxysuccinimide ester from Sigma-Aldrich. Streptavidin-coated magnetic Dynabeads M-280 were from Dynal Biotech ASA (Oslo, Norway). The Supersignal West Dura extended duration substrate was from Pierce. Phospholipid Vesicle Preparation—Phospholipid vesicles were prepared by sonication. The mixtures of phospholipids (10:90, PS/PC) were dissolved in CHCl3/CHOH (9:1, v/v) and kept at –20 °C. Aliquots were drawn from the stocks, dried under N2, and then resuspended in 25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.7, at room temperature. The resuspended phospholipids were sonicated in a XL 2020 sonicator (Misonix, New York) for 10 min. Fresh phospholipid vesicles were prepared every day. Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant human WT protein C was prepared, purified, activated by thrombin, and then isolated, and its concentration was determined by absorbance and chromogenic substrate S2366, as described (24Shen L. Shah A.M. Dahlback B. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16025-16031Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Shen L. Shah A. Dahlback B. Nelsestuen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31086-31091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The recombinant QGNSEDY protein C was produced, purified, and activated by thrombin as described (26Sun Y.H. Shen L. Dahlback B. Blood. 2003; 101: 2277-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The recombinant FV variants 306Q679Q and 506Q679Q were constructed as previously described (22Norstrom E. Thorelli E. Dahlback B. Blood. 2002; 100: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The recombinant FV variants were transiently expressed in Cos-1 cells using the diethyl aminoethyldextran transfection method (30Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, FV cDNA in pMT2 vector was mixed with Tris, pH 7.3, 0.1 mm chloroquine, and DEAE dextran in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Invitrogen) and incubated for 4 h. The cells were thereafter shocked with 10% Me2SO for 2 min. The proteins were harvested in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM) 60–70 h after transfection and concentrated in a Vivaspin concentrator having a molecular weight cut off of 100,000 (Vivaspin). Aliquots were frozen at –80 °C. The concentrations of the recombinant proteins were determined with both ELISA and prothrombinase assay. The FV-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed as described (22Norstrom E. Thorelli E. Dahlback B. Blood. 2002; 100: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Affinity Purification of Recombinant FVa Using Monoclonal Antibody MK30 —Recombinant FVa was isolated by affinity purification using the monoclonal antibody MK30 against the B domain of FV. The principle of the purification was to bind recombinant FV to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads that were covered with biotinylated MK30. After binding of FV and washing, FVa was released from the bead-associated MK30 by the addition of thrombin. The B domain remained associated with the MK30-beads. The released FVa was subsequently used in the APC degradation experiments. The details of the technique were as follows. Dynabeads (228 μl of 6.7 × 108 beads/ml) were washed 3 times with 228 μl of 25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.7, with 5 mg/ml BSA and 5 mm CaCl2 (HNSBSACa) and resuspended in 228 μl of biotinylated MK30 solution (80 μg/ml) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The beads were then washed with 3 × 91 μl of HNSBSACa. The recombinant FV variants (130 μl at 16 nm) were mixed with the beads and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times in 91 μl of HNSBSACa, resuspended in 117 μl of HNSBSACa, and mixed with 6.5 μl of 10 units/ml of thrombin. After 10 min at 37 °C, 6.5 μl of 100 units/ml hirudin was added. The magnetic beads were removed, and the concentration of the eluted FVa was measured in the PTase assay and typically found to be around 5 nm. This FVa was used in the APC degradation. The purified FVa was prepared immediately before the APC-degradation experiment. APC-mediated Inactivation of Recombinant FVa Variants—The experimental conditions used to monitor the FVa degradation, e.g. the FVa concentration that is well below the Km of the reactions, were similar to those originally described and discussed by Nicolaes et al. (15Nicolaes G.A. Tans G. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Pabinger I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21158-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To examine the time-course of APC cleavages at Arg-306 and Arg-506, the FVa inactivation assay was performed using recombinant 506Q679Q-FVa and 306Q679Q-FVa, respectively. The FVa used in the assay was either affinity-purified using biotinylated MK30 FV and magnetic beads as described above, or the recombinant FVa was used without prior purification. For all experiments including Western blotting, affinity-purified FVa was used. The kinetic parameters were found to be similar whether the FVa had been purified or not. In experiments using non-purified FVa, the recombinant FV (0.8 nm final concentration) was incubated with thrombin (0.5 units/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C in HNSBSACa, and hirudin was then added to a final concentration of 5 units/ml. This thrombin concentration (equivalent to 4.6 nm), which was in fact higher than the FV concentration, was experimentally found to yield rapid (within 10 min) and full activation of the FV. To the purified or non-purified FVa (0.8 nm final concentration), phospholipid vesicles (final concentration of 2.5 or 25 μm) were added, and a subsample was drawn from the mixture and diluted ⅕ in ice-cold HNSBSACa buffer. APC was subsequently added to reach the final concentrations specified in each experiment. The Arg-306 and Arg-506 sites have different sensitivities for APC both in the presence and absence of protein S, and different concentrations of APC were, therefore, used to obtain inactivation curves suitable for calculation of kinetic parameters. For the 506Q679Q-FVa variant, the concentration of APC was 0.5 nm when the degradation was performed in the absence of protein S and 0.05 nm when protein S was present. For the 306Q679Q-FVa variant, the concentration of APC was 0.05 nm. At different time points, samples were drawn from the inactivation mixture and diluted ⅕ in ice-cold HNSBSACa to stop the reaction. To measure remaining FVa activity 10 μl of the diluted samples were added to 250 μl of the PTase mix, and the thrombin generation was determined as described above. APC Degradation of Affinity-purified FVa Variants Visualized by Western Blotting—The affinity-purified FVa variants (final concentration 0.8 nm) were incubated with WT-APC or QGNSEDY-APC (concentration indicated for each individual experiment) with or without 100 nm protein S in the presence of 25 μm phospholipid (PS/PC w/w 10/90). At different time points the remaining FVa activity was determined, and in separate aliquots the inactivation was stopped by the addition of denaturing sample preparation solution. The samples were run under reducing conditions in a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. A monoclonal antibody against the heavy chain of FVa, AHV5146, was used together with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and the Supersignal West Dura extended duration chemiluminescence substrate to detect the FVa fragments. The chemiluminescence was recorded with a Fuji LAS 3000IR CCD camera, and the signals were quantified with the ImageGauge program. Prothrombinase Assay—A prothrombinase-based assay was used to determine the procoagulant activity of FVa as described (26Sun Y.H. Shen L. Dahlback B. Blood. 2003; 101: 2277-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In brief, a mixture of 0.5 μm prothrombin and 50 μm phospholipid vesicles (10/90 (w/w) PS/PC) was prepared in 25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.7, containing 0.5 mg/ml ovalbumin (HNO buffer). FV was activated by thrombin (final concentration, 0.5 units/ml) at 37 °C for 10 min. FXa (final concentration of 5 nm for 506Q679Q-FVa inactivation and 0.1 nm for 306Q679Q-FVa inactivation) mixed with FVa samples were added to the prothrombinase mixture. Two minutes after the addition of FXa, the prothrombin activation was stopped by a 40-fold dilution in ice-cold EDTA buffer. The lower FXa concentration used for the 306Q679Q-FVa variant was chosen because the remaining FVa activity of position 506-cleaved FVa was much lower at 0.1 nm FXa than that at 5 nm FXa, which facilitated evaluation of the Arg-506 cleavage rate (16Norstrøm E. Steen M. Tran S. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24904-24911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The EDTA buffer contained 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1% polyethylene glycol 6000, pH 7.9. The amount of thrombin formed was measured kinetically with a chromogenic substrate, S2238. Immunoprecipitation with HV-1 to Quantify FVa Light-Heavy Chain Dissociation—To quantify the dissociation between the FVa heavy and light chains in FVa, occurring before and during the APC degradation, a biotinylated light chain antibody, HV-1, was used together with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The beads were coated with 80 μg/ml HV-1 before the immunoprecipitation experiment. The affinity-purified 306Q679Q-FVa (0.8 nm final concentration) was incubated with 25 μm phospholipids (PS/PC w/w 10/90) in HNSBSACa with buffer WT- or QGNSEDY-APC (0.05 nm final concentrations) for 15 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 200 μl. Aliquots (20 μl) were drawn before and 15 min after the addition of the APC, and the FVa activity was measured with the PTase assay. Aliquots (20 μl) were drawn for Western blotting, and separate aliquots (50 μl) were drawn and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the HV-1-coated magnetic beads (a 60-μl bead solution was used for each precipitation; the beads buffer was removed before the addition of the 50-μl aliquot from the FVa degradation). After 30 min of incubation at 4 °C, the beads were removed, and the supernatant was withdrawn for Western blotting and PTase assay. The beads were washed with 3 × 60 μl of HNSBSACa, and the proteins were then eluted with 100 μl of 95 °C sample preparation buffer and subjected to Western blotting using the heavy chain antibody AHV5146, as described above. Equations Used for Curve Fitting—The APC-mediated inactivation of 506Q679Q-FVa and 306Q679Q-FVa was followed over time, and the results were used to calculate pseudo first order rates for the Arg-306 and Arg-506 cleavages, respectively. The curves were fitted to an equation earlier reported (9Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27852-27858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 15Nicolaes G.A. Tans G. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Pabinger I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21158-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The equation was modified because only one cleavage occurs in our FV variants. For calculation of the Arg-506 cleavage, the time curves obtained for 306Q679Q-FVa were fitted to the following equation,Vat=Va0e−k506t+BVa0(1−e−k506t)(Eq. 1) in which Vat is the cofactor activity determined at time t, Va0 is the cofactor activity determined before APC is added, B is the remaining procoagulant cofactor activity of FVa cleaved at Arg-506, and k506 is the rate constant of cleavage at Arg-506. For calculation of the Arg-306 cleavage, the following equation was used to fit the time curve of 506Q679Q-FVa.Vat=Va0e−k306t+CVa0(1−e−k306t)(Eq. 2) Here C is the remaining procoagulant cofactor activity of FVa cleaved at Arg-306, and k306 is the rate constant of cleavage at Arg-306. The use of the equations requires that the inactivation curves are independent of FVa concentration (% FVa inactivation versus time) and that the rates are linear for APC concentration. Control experiments were performed, and the inactivation curves fulfilled these criteria. Degradation of Recombinant FVa by Wild Type- and Gla-mutated APC—Purified recombinant WT-FVa was incubated with recombinant WT-APC or the Gla domain-mutant QGNSEDY-APC in the presence of negatively charged phospholipid vesicles (Fig. 1). At intervals, aliquots were drawn, and the remaining FVa activity was measured with a PTase-based FVa assay. The APC-mediated fragmentation of the FVa heavy chain was visualized by Western blotting using the monoclonal antibody AHV5146 that recognized the 307–506 fragment. A chemiluminescence-based technique was used that allowed quantification of the immune-reactive bands. The inactivation was performed in the absence (Fig. 1, left panels) and presence of protein S (Fig. 1, right panels). Protein S stimulated the rate of FVa degradation, and lower APC concentrations were, therefore, used in incubations containing protein S. WT-APC alone yielded an initial rapid loss of FVa activity, which is consistent with selective cleavage at Arg-506. At the high concentration of FXa (5 nm) used in the PTase assay, the remaining FVa activity after Arg-506 cleavage was around 60%. According to the Western blot (Fig. 1B, left panel), the heavy chain was cleaved within the first 5 min, and the 1–506 fragment appeared. This was slowly cleaved at Arg-306 to generate the 307–506 fragment, which was barely detectable in the incubation containing WT-APC. In the starting material an additional weak band located just above the 1–506 position was occasionally observed (marked with an asterisk). This band, which represented around 10–20% of the total heavy chain in the starting material, disappeared in parallel with the heavy chain, and a weak band located just below the position of the 307–709 band was generated (marked with a plus in Fig. 1B). This suggests that the band represents a small amount of heavy chain that was cleaved at an unknown position located before Arg-306 before the addition of APC, possibly already in the expressing cells. The presence of this band did not affect the interpretation of the results. In the presence of QGNSEDY-APC the initial loss of FVa activity was faster than with WT-APC. The FVa activity did not reach a plateau, and after 15 min, the FVa activity was below 20% of the original level. On the Western blotting (Fig. 1, B and C, left) the heavy chain disappeared quicker with QGNSEDY-APC than with WT-APC, and the 1–506 fragment was further cleaved at Arg-306 to generate the 307–506 fragment. The 10% remaining un-cleaved heavy chain (quantification of bands in Fig. 1C) represented heavy chain that had dissociated from the light chain already, before the APC degradatio"

Purified fractions of a recombinant IHD miniprotein are active in a set of in vitro assays highlighting its affinity to the N-terminal LXXLL domain of p53 including (i) dose-dependent binding to Ser-20-phosphorylated p53 tetramers; (ii) DNA-stimulated binding to p53 tetramers; and (iii) inhibition of MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. The active component of the IHD miniprotein was localized to a 75-amino-acid fragment corresponding to amino acids 401–475 on human p300. This minimal IHD miniprotein can function in vivo as a p53-binding polypeptide in assays including: (i) complex formation with VP16-LXXLL peptide motifs in the two-hybrid assay; (ii) action as a dominant negative inhibitor of p53 from p21 luciferase templates; and (iii) attenuation of endogenous p21 protein levels. Further, we show here that the IRF-1-dependent stabilization and reactivation of p53ΔPRO protein (LXXLL+/PXXP-) can be neutralized by the minimal IHD miniprotein, suggesting that IHD can bind to the p53 LXXLL domain in vivo. Phage-peptide display to the IHD miniprotein gave rise to an LSQXTFSXLXXLL consensus binding site that displays significant homology to the LXXLL transactivation domain of p53.

Characterizing the protein-protein interactions that assemble transcription complexes will provide a molecular basis for combinatorial specificity at the promoter level and give an insight into how transcriptosomes affect tumorigenesis. The tumor suppressor p53 is a central regulatory component of an evolutionary conserved mechanism that responds to certain stresses that impinge upon genomic integrity by inducing regulated responses such a cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and/or programmed cell death (1Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2673) Google Scholar). The stress-activated tumor suppressor protein p53 has been well characterized as a transcription factor that associates with basal transcription machinery. The vast array of genes that p53 induces and/or represses in response to cell injury provides an excellent model system with which to identify the complex and transient associations with co-activators/repressors and the core promoter transcriptional apparatus that drive promoter activation (2Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar). Central to the stress-activated transcription program of p53 is the interaction with the transcriptional co-activator p300 (3Grossman S.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2773-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The p300/CREB-binding protein family of proteins participate in many physiological processes, including proliferation and differentiation and apoptosis (4Janknecht R. Histol. Histopathol. 2002; 17: 657-668PubMed Google Scholar). p300 functions as a transcriptional co-activator that is involved in multiple signal-dependent transcription events (5Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viral onco-proteins, such as the adenoviral E1A and SV40 T antigen, possess high affinity for specific binding sites with p300 (6Arany I. Rady P. Evers B.M. Tyring S.K. Townsend Jr., C.M. Surg. Oncol. 1994; 3: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which results in the loss of cell growth control, enhancement of DNA synthesis, and blocks in cellular differentiation (7Shikama N. Lutz W. Kretzschmar R. Sauter N. Roth J.F. Marino S. Wittwer J. Scheidweiler A. Eckner R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5175-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). There are data implicating altered p300 gene expression in an array of human tumors (5Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p300 contains three broad functional domains including: (i) an acetyltransferase domain that mediates substrate acetylation; (ii) a bromodomain, which is implicated in binding to acetylated amino acids; and (iii) a variety of LXXLL, PXXP, and other transactivation peptide-binding domains. The coordinated function of these domains is thought to mediate the role of p300 as a bridge, scaffold, and/or catalyst for binding to transcriptional components and the activation of gene expression. The tetrameric nature of p53, its allosteric properties, the enzymatic activity of p300 involved in its activation of p53, and the multiple transactivation peptide-binding domains of p300 make the p300:p53 complex an attractive model to understand the dynamic nature of a biological machine, an important goal in the dissection of the proteome. The molecular mechanism by which p53 tetramers interact with p300 and how this modulates acetylation are beginning to be defined biochemically. Reconstitution of purified forms of the p300:p53 protein complex in vitro followed by validation in vivo have identified sequential stages in p300:p53 complex dynamics and include: (i) docking-dependent phosphorylation of the LXXLL motif at Thr-18 or Ser-20 by enzymes of the calcium-calmodulin superfamily such as CHK2 and CHK1 (8Craig A. Scott M. Burch L. Smith G. Ball K. Hupp T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); (ii) stabilization of p300 binding to the p53 activation domain by phosphorylation at Thr-18 or Ser-20 (9Dornan D. Hupp T.R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); (iii) anchoring of p300 to the contiguous phospho-LXXLL and PXXP activation domains in p53 (10Dornan D. Shimizu H. Burch L. Smith A.J. Hupp T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8846-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); (iv) sequence-specific DNA binding by p53, which induces a conformational change in the tetramer, forcing acetylation to be DNA-dependent and PXXP-dependent (10Dornan D. Shimizu H. Burch L. Smith A.J. Hupp T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8846-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); and (v) acetylation of DNA-bound p53 that in turn stabilizes the p300:acetylated p53:DNA complex (11Dornan D. Shimizu H. Perkins N.D. Hupp T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13431-13441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). How this multidomain scaffold arranges itself onto an “octavalent” substrate such as p53 is not known, nor is it known how acetylation of the native p53 oligomer can be constrained in the absence of consensus site DNA. The ability of IF-1 protein to bind to p300 and stimulate p53 acetylation by a novel allosteric mechanism (see also Ref. 22Dornan D. Eckart M. Shimizu H. Hupp T. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) further highlights the multifaceted and dynamic nature of the p300:p53 complex assembly. To continue dissecting out how p300 can bind to p53, we have mapped the various Ser-20-phospho-LXXLL and PXXP peptide-binding domains of p300 and have found them to map to regions distinct from the classic C/H1 and C/H3 p53 activation-binding domains (10Dornan D. Shimizu H. Burch L. Smith A.J. Hupp T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8846-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These peptide-binding regions in p300, in turn, are distinct from the binding of IRF-1 activation domain interfaces on p300 (see also Ref. 22Dornan D. Eckart M. Shimizu H. Hupp T. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Together with mapping data from other approaches, these data identify at least eight peptide-binding minidomains of p300 that can contact p53 including C/H1, C/H3, IBiD, 1The abbreviations used are: IBiD, interferon-binding domain; IHD, IBiD homology domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; RLU, relative light units.1The abbreviations used are: IBiD, interferon-binding domain; IHD, IBiD homology domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; RLU, relative light units. IHD, SPC-1, SPC-2, KIX, and Bromo. The major Ser-20-phospho-LXXLL p53-binding domains of p300 have been mapped to the C-terminal IBiD (12Lin C.H. Hare B.J. Wagner G. Harrison S.C. Maniatis T. Fraenkel E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and N-terminal IHD scaffolds (11Dornan D. Shimizu H. Perkins N.D. Hupp T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13431-13441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Both of these miniproteins can function as dominant negative inhibitors of p300-coactivated stimulation of p53-depednent gene expression in cells (11Dornan D. Shimizu H. Perkins N.D. Hupp T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13431-13441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, only the C-terminal IBiD domain has been examined structurally (12Lin C.H. Hare B.J. Wagner G. Harrison S.C. Maniatis T. Fraenkel E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The IBiD scaffold was defined by mapping regions of p300 that bind to phosphorylated activation domain fragments from IRF-3, although the miniprotein can also bind to non-phosphorylated activation domain fragments of other proteins. This apparent lack of “sequence specificity” in IBiD miniprotein binding to activation domain peptides is rationalized by the ability of unstructured activation domain peptides to acquire structure by an induced fit mechanism upon scaffold binding. Thus, it may be the capacity of a peptide to form a helix that makes it a good IBiD-binding motif. The structure and minimal LXXLL peptide binding activity of the N-terminal IHD miniprotein are not known, nor is it known whether the IHD scaffold has intrinsic peptide consensus site for selected polypeptides. Characterization of IHD and determination of whether it has a stringent peptide-docking site consensus site will advance dissection of the p300:p53 complex assembly. In this report, we define the minimal IHD scaffold to a 75-aminoacid fragment with homology to the minimal IBiD region of p300, demonstrate that IHD can contact the LXXLL region of p53 by a variety of assays including inhibition of IRF-1 reactivation of p53ΔPRO, and demonstrate by phage-peptide display that the IHD miniprotein prefers a consensus peptide motif with significant homology to the LXXLL motif of p53. These data indicate that IHD is a bona fide LXXLL-p53 scaffold that promotes the formation of transcriptionally active complex between p53 and the co-activator p300. Reagents and Enzymes—Recombinant human p53 was purified from insect cells and bacterial expression systems using heparin-Sepharose, as described previously (13Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The IHD domain of human p300 (amino acids 401–575) was subcloned into the Invitrogen pDONR201 entry vector and shuttled by recombination into the His-tagged destination vector for purification from bacteria. After induction, the His-tagged IHD was purified using nickel-affinity resin, and the protein concentration and purity were determined using the Bradford method and a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-gel. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to create 3-′ stop codon insertions within the pDONR-IHD401–575 vector, with the following primer designs (Table I) to be used to create the specific deletion mutants as follows: IHD401–553 IHD401–502 IHD401–475 IHD401–428, respectively. Subsequent gateway cloning was carried out, transferring the deletion mutants to pBIND and pDEST vectors to be used for mammalian two-hybrid assays, p21 transcriptional assays, and endogenous protein assays carried out (11Dornan D.

The mammalian two-hybrid system for evaluating p300 minidomain binding to the LXXLL activation domain of p53 was described previously (11Dornan D. Shimizu H. Perkins N.D. Hupp T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13431-13441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). P53ΔPRO (lacking the proline-repeat transactivation domain) was described previously. The IRF-1 expression plasmid was a gift of Dr Kathryn Ball (University of Edinburgh). In vitro ubiquitination assays using purified MDM2 and p53 were described previously (14Burch L. Shimizu H. Smith A. Patterson C. Hupp T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Phage-peptide Display—Phage-peptide display using purified IHD minidomain was done as described previously for MDM2 (14Burch L. Shimizu H. Smith A. Patterson C. Hupp T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and p300 (10Dornan D. Shimizu H. Burch L. Smith A.J. Hupp T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8846-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, a PhD.-12 phage display library kit (New England Biolabs) was used, which contains random 12-mer peptides fused to the coat protein (pIII) of M13 phage. The displayed 12-mer peptides are expressed at the N terminus of pIII and followed by a short spacer (Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser) and then the coding region of wild-type pIII protein. The complexity of the library was defined at 1.9 × 109 different peptide sequences, and the titer was 2 × 1012 plaque-forming units/ml. A Microlite 2 96-well flat bottom plate (Dynatech Laboratories) was coated with 1 μg/ml the anti-His monoclonal antibody by diluting in 100 μl of coating buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 8.6) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The wells were then blocked with blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were then washed extensively with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 followed by incubation of IHD protein (100 ng) in 100 μl of blocking buffer. After 1 h, followed by extensive washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the wells were then incubated for 1 h with 1 × 1011 phage particles in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 followed by extensive washing in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The phage particles were eluted by incubation with 0.2 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.2), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with gentle rocking for 10 min and then neutralized with 15 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.1). Eluted phage particles were then amplified by infection of ER2378 cells for 4.5 h, and the phage were polyethylene glycol-precipitated, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The biopanning procedure was repeated three times, and ∼1 × 1011 plaque-forming units of the second or third round amplified eluate were used as input phage. In addition, the Tween 20 concentration in the binding and wash buffers was increased stepwise (from 0.1 to 0.5%), with each successive round of biopanning to reduce nonspecific binding of the amplified phage-peptide particles. The third round polyethylene glycol-precipitated phage were titrated, individual plaques were tested for p53-specific-binding activity, and the DNA was amplified and prepared according to the manufacturer's (New England Biolabs) protocol. The Applied Biosytems Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer was used to sequence the DNA with the -96gIII primer. The sequence data from the 12-mer peptides obtained were then analyzed using the e-motif, blast NCBI databases, and ClustalW to identify consensus peptide motifs with homology to known or uncharacterized proteins (see Fig. 8 for summarized examples). ELISA Quantitation of the Binding of IHD to p53—A Microlite 2 96 flat bottom plate (Dynatech Laboratories) was coated with purified p53 fractions, as indicated, in 0.1 m sodium borate (pH 9) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The wells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the following: IHD protein (increasing amounts or fixed levels, as indicated) diluted in a total volume of 50 μl in buffer (containing 1.5% glycerol, 2.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.02% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm benzamidine). After incubation for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:500 dilution of anti-His tagged antibody in blocking buffer, the reactions were then detected with rabbit-anti mouse horseradish peroxidase monoclonal antibody (DAKO) and developed as detailed above. When p53 consensus site DNA was included in the binding reactions, the consensus site PG DNA was added prior to p53 addition to the wells. The effects of MDM2 and p300 binding to serine 20 phosphorylated p53 have been defined; MDM2 binding is not affected by the serine 20 phosphorylation (15Schon O. Friedler A. Bycroft M. Freund S.M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), whereas p300 full-length p300 protein binding is stabilized by a phosphate addition at the serine 20 residue (9Dornan D. Hupp T.R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The major serine 20 LXXLL phospho-binding domains of p300 were mapped to two regions: the C-terminal IBiD (interferon-binding domain) miniprotein and an N-terminal 17-kDa miniprotein with homology to IBiD (Fig. 1, A and B) that we have named IHD (IBiD homology domain). To fine-map IHD further and evaluate its specificity for LXXLL-containing peptides, the His6-tagged 17-kDa miniprotein (amino acids 401–566) was expressed and purified from bacterial expression systems. The specific activity of the IHD miniprotein was measured using fractions of p53 protein purified from insect cell expression systems in which serine 20 phosphorylated pools of p53 (i.e. fraction 20; Fig. 2A) can be chromatographically separated from serine 20 unphosphorylated p53 (i.e. fraction 16; Fig. 2A). When equivalent amounts of total p53 protein (2.5–100 ng; fraction 16 or fraction 20) were adsorbed onto ELISA wells, and fixed amounts of IHD were added, p53-dependent binding to the IHD miniprotein was detected with an anti-His monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2, B and C). The serine 20 phosphorylated pool of p53 (fraction 20) bound more stably to the IHD miniprotein (from 5 to 7 RLU; Fig. 1C) when compared with unphosphorylated p53 (fraction 16), which bound weaker to IHD (from 0.7 to 1 RLU; Fig. 1B). A titration of the IHD miniprotein into ELISA wells containing fixed amounts of p53 in the solid phase also demonstrated more stable complex binding to serine 20 phosphorylated p53 (fraction 20 versus fraction 16, ∼10 versus ∼3 RLU, respectively; Fig. 2D). As a control for p53 protein fractions 16 and 20 normalization, the antibody DO-1 (which contacts p53 within the MDM2-binding site (Fig. 3A)) bound to p53 (fractions 16 and 20) to similar extents (∼800 RLU; Fig. 2E). Further, the antibody DO-1 bound to p53 with a relative affinity ∼50-fold higher than the IHD miniprotein (compare the RLU at saturating protein levels (>40 ng)), which is consistent with the known high affinity of the mAb DO-1 for its epitope. Together, these data indicate that purified forms of the IHD miniprotein show binding to p53 that can in turn be stabilized further by the phospho-serine 20 residue.Fig. 3The IHD miniprotein inhibits MDM2-mediated ubiquitination (Ub) of p53. A, contact sites for MDM2 and p300 in the activation domain of p53. The N-terminal activation domain of human p53 (Hp53) along with the homologous region in fish p53 (Fp53) are indicated. The upper arrows highlight key contacts for MDM2, whereas the lower arrows highlight the contacts for p300 (Ref. 9Dornan D. Hupp T.R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The underlined amino acids are conserved amino acids in the p300 consensus binding site. B, IHD inhibits wild type p53 ubiquitination by MDM2 in vitro. Ubiquitination reactions were assembled without MDM2 (lane 1) or with MDM2 (lanes 2–12). A control antibody (lanes 4–8) or increasing amounts of IHD (lanes 9–12) was added. Ubiquitination reactions were stopped after 10 min, and reaction products were blotted with DO-1 to detect the p53 ubiquitination ladder. C, in vivo p53 ubiquitination. P53 wild-type (lane 2) or mutant p53 encoded by the R175H allele (lane 3) genes (0.5 μg of DNA) were transfected alone or with MDM2 into H1299 cells (2 μg of DNA; lanes 4 and 5). After 24 h, the cell lysates were immunoblotted to examine for changes in their amount of ubiquitination products by immunoblotting with antibodies to p53 (DO-1), as described previously (Shimizu et al. (14Burch L. Shimizu H. Smith A. Patterson C. Hupp T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)). D, IHD inhibits mutant p53R175H ubiquitination in vivo. Co-transfected mutant p53R175H and MDM2 genes (lanes 1–4) were co-transfected with increasing amounts of VP16-tagged IHD (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 μg of DNA, lanes 2–4). After 24 h, the cell lysates were immunoblotted to look for changes in their amount of ubiquitination products by immunoblotting with antibodies to p53 (DO-1). VP-16 antibody (lower panel) was used to show the dose-dependent increases in VP16-tagged IHD miniprotein levels that perturb MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) One notable feature of p53 acetylation is the DNA dependence in the acetylation reaction (11Dornan D. Shimizu H. Perkins N.D. Hupp T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13431-13441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These data suggest that DNA binding changes the conformation of p53 to permit a more stable docking of p300 to p53. In fact, sequence-specific DNA can stabilize full-length p300 binding to p53 in the absence of acetyl-CoA (11Dornan D. Shimizu H. Perkins N.D. Hupp T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13431-13441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We tested whether the purified IHD miniprotein bound more stably to p53 in the presence of consensus site DNA. A titration of consensus site DNA into an ELISA reaction containing fixed amounts of p53 in the solid phase stimulated IHD-p53 protein complex formation (Fig. 2, F and G). These data suggest that the reason DNA stabilizes the p300:p53 complex can be attributed, at least in part, to an enhanced affinity of the IHD miniprotein for the LXXLL activation domain in p53. The ability of DNA to change the conformation of p53 in the LXXLL domain identifies an allosteric effect in p53, in particular identifying an interaction between the LXXLL-containing transactivation domain and the core DNA-binding domain. We next evaluated whether IHD can bind to the transactivation domain of p53 as defined by its ability to interfere with MDM2-mediated ubiquitination, which binds to overlapping amino acids in the activation domain (Fig. 3A). MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 (Fig. 3B, lane 2 versus lane 1) is unaffected by a control antibody that binds to denatured p53 (Fig. 3B, lanes 4–8). By contrast, a titration of IHD results in inhibition of MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 (Fig. 3B, lanes 9–12). In vivo ubiquitination of p53 catalyzed by MDM2 (Fig. 3C, lanes 4 and 5 versus lanes 2 and 3) can also be attenuated by IHD in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D, lanes 2–4 versus lane 1). Together, these data identify three biochemical properties of the IHD miniprotein (amino acids 401–566), suggestive of its ability to interact with the LXXLL transactivation domain of p53 tetramers: (i) enhanced affinity for serine 20 phosphorylated p53 tetramers; (ii) DNA-stimulated IHD-p53 tetramer complex stabilization; and (iii) sterical occlusion of MDM2 from the p53 transactivation domain and inhibition of MDM2-catalyzed ubiquitination. The LXXLL binding activity associated with IHD miniprotein was fine mapped by constructing progressive deletions of the IHD coding region (Fig. 4G). This was required to determine which region of the 17-kDa IHD miniprotein was primarily responsible for LXXLL binding activity, especially in comparison with its homology domain in the C terminus, IBiD. The IBiD domain of p300 was localized to a 46-amino-acid fragment that has homology to the extreme N terminus of IHD (Fig. 1B). The GAL4-VP16 in vivo two-hybrid assay was used to evaluate the specific activity of the IHD miniprotein fragments, rather than in vitro-specific activity, since expression of the IHD deletion fragments from Escherichia coli proved relatively difficult (data not shown). In comparing the in vivo-specific activity of the IHD miniprotein and its deletion derivatives for LXXLL-containing peptides, two other peptide-binding domains were evaluated: (i) IBiD, which binds to phosphorylated activation domain fragments from IRF-3 as well as non-phosphorylated fragments of other activation domains (12Lin C.H. Hare B.J. Wagner G. Harrison S.C. Maniatis T. Fraenkel E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and (ii) SPC-1 (site for proline contact (10Dornan D. Shimizu H. Burch L. Smith A.J. Hupp T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8846-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), a C-terminal minidomain of p300 containing only half of the C/H3 domain and amino acid sequences without the classic C/H3 domain) that was identified previously as having LXXLL peptide binding activity despite lacking the N-terminal 56 amino acids of the standard C/H3 domain (164 amino acids in length). As a control for the two-hybrid assay, MyoD fused to VP16 displayed affinity for its peptide sequence in inhibitor of DNA binding when fused to GAL4 (Fig. 4B), whereas the LXXLL peptide from p53 bound weakly to MyoD (Fig. 4B). Under the conditions used in the in vivo two-hybrid assay, the IHD miniprotein (401–566) was the most active under these conditions toward the LXXLL peptide from the entire p53 activation domain (Fig. 4C) and lower activity to the LXXLL peptide in a very short sequence from the LXXLL activation domain of p53 (Fig. 4C). Alterations in growth conditions can affect the binding activity of SPC-1(PAN) (pan-reactive peptide binding region of p300) and IBiD for peptides containing the LXXLL motifs so that the IHD domain does not always display the highest activity for LXXLL-containing peptides (as in Fig. 4E; data not shown), suggesting that competition for endogenous LXXLL-binding proteins can effect the GAL4-VP16 interaction. The most extreme deletion of the IHD miniprotein (amino acids 401–427) well into the motif with homology to IBiD (Fig. 1B) inactivates the LXXLL binding activity associated with the miniprotein (Fig. 4F). Interestingly, this region of IHD maps to the first helix in the IBiD domain required for IBiD activity (12Lin C.H. Hare B.J. Wagner G. Harrison S.C. Maniatis T. Fraenkel E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and suggests that the minimal IHD domain directly overlaps with a similar primary structure in IBiD, despite the fact that the entire 165-amino-acid fragment within IHD and IBiD share homology.

RFC is characterized by 12 stretches of mostly hydrophobic, α-helix-promoting amino acids, internally oriented N and C termini, and a large central linker connecting transmembrane domains (TMDs) 1–6 and 7–12. Previous studies showed that deletion of the majority of the central loop domain between TMDs 6 and 7 abolished transport, but this segment could be replaced with mostly non-homologous sequence from the SLC19A2 thiamine transporter to restore transport function. In this report, we expressed RFC from separate TMD1–6 and TMD7–12 RFC half-molecule constructs, each with a unique epitope tag, in RFC-null K562 cells to restore transport activity. Restored transport exhibited characteristic transport kinetics for methotrexate, a capacity for trans-stimulation by pretreatment with leucovorin, and inhibition by N-hydroxysuccinimide methotrexate, a documented affinity inhibitor of RFC. The TMD1–6 half-molecule migrated on SDS gels as a 38–58 kDa glycosylated species and was converted to 27 kDa by N-glycosidase F or tunicamycin treatments. The 40 kDa TMD7–12 half-molecule was unaffected by these treatments. Using transfected cells expressing both TMDs 1–6 and TMDs 7–12 as separate polypeptides, the TMD7–12 half-molecule was covalently radiolabeled with N-hydroxysuccinimide [3H]methotrexate. No radioactivity was incorporated into the TMD1–6 half-molecule. Digestion with endoproteinase GluC decreased the size of the radiolabeled 40 kDa TMD7–12 polypeptide to ∼20 kDa. Our results demonstrate that a functional RFC can be reconstituted with RFC half-molecules and localize a critical substrate binding domain to within TMDs 7–12.

For reduced folates, uptake is essential for supplying sufficient cofactors for DNA synthesis and cell proliferation.

This 12 TMD topology model has been experimentally confirmed by a combination of approaches including scanning hemagglutinin (HA) epitope insertion and glycosylation insertion mutagenesis (13Ferguson P.L. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16269-16278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Liu X.Y. Matherly L.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1564: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and, most recently, by scanning cysteine insertional mutagenesis and accessibility methods (15Flintoff W.F. Williams F.M.R.

The amino acids located in the TMDs are, in general, highly conserved (70.2%) between species with somewhat greater homology concentrated in TMDs 1–6 than 7–12 (75.9 and 64.7%, respectively). Potentially important amino acids in the RFC protein were identified by site-directed mutagenesis of conserved charged amino acids (e.g. Asp88, Arg133, Arg373, Lys411; all numbers correspond to hRFC) (17Liu X.Y.

Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to distinguish direct functional effects of amino acid replacements on substrate binding and membrane translocation from indirect effects mediated by charge interactions and altered protein conformations. Nonetheless, recent studies with cysteine scanning accessibility methods have corroborated findings of mutant studies that implicated amino acids flanking TMD1 (e.g. Gly44, Ile48) as functionally important (15Flintoff W.F. Williams F.M.R. Sadlish H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40867-40876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 28Cao W. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In striking contrast to the TMD regions, the 61 amino acids comprising the central connecting loop between TMDs 6 and 7 of hRFC are less conserved (44.3% homology between hRFC and rodent RFCs). Indeed, large deletions in this region of the murine (31 of 66 amino acids) and hamster (45 of 67 amino acids) RFCs preserved membrane targeting and transport activity, as long as a highly conserved stretch of 11 amino acids (corresponding to positions 204–214 in hRFC) was present (29Sadlish H. Williams F.M. Flintoff W.F. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 30Sharina I.G. Zhao R. Wang Y. Babani S. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1717-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In hRFC, deletions of 49 or 60 amino acids from the TMD6/7 linker (amino acids 215–263 and 204–263, respectively) completely abolished transport activity for both Mtx and 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate (5-CHO-H4PteGlu) (31Liu X.Y. Witt T.L. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 31-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that some minimal length for the linker is necessary. Further, replacement of the deleted segments with non-homologous 73 or 84 amino acid segments of the structurally analogous thiamine transporter SLC19A2 (18% homologous to hRFC for the TMD6/7 linker) completely restored transport (31Liu X.Y. Witt T.L. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 31-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, with the exception of the conserved 204–214 amino acid segment, it appears that the primary role of the connecting loop between TMDs 6 and 7 is to ensure the proper spacing between the two halves of hRFC protein for optimal function, and that this is virtually independent of amino acid sequence. In this report, we further explore the role of the central connecting loop and the relationship between the N- and C-terminal membrane-spanning domains by expressing hRFC from separate TMD1–6 and TMD7–12 half-molecule constructs, each with a unique epitope tag, in our well established hRFC-null K562 (K500E) model (32Wong S.C. McQuade R. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our results establish an absolute requirement for both TMD1–6 and TMD7–12 half-molecules for high-level surface expression and restoration of transport activity. Using transfected cells expressing both TMDs 1–6 and 7–12 as separate polypeptides, we covalently labeled the TMD7–12 region with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) [3H]Mtx, a documented radioaffinity ligand for RFC (33Henderson G.B.

Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3420-3426PubMed Google Scholar), to directly demonstrate an important role for this region in transport substrate binding.

Unlabeled Mtx and (6R,S)-5-CHO-H4PteGlu (Leucovorin) were provided by the Drug Development Branch, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. Both labeled and unlabeled Mtx were purified by HPLC prior to use (36Fry D.W. Yalowich J.C. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1890-1896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction and modifying enzymes were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Tissue culture reagents and supplies were purchased from assorted vendors with the exception of iron-supplemented calf serum, which was from Hyclone Laboratories, Inc. (Logan, UT). Cell Culture—The Mtx transport-deficient K562 subline, designated K500E, was selected from wild-type K562 cells (American Type Culture Collection) and maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% iron-supplemented calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.5 μm of Mtx (32Wong S.C. McQuade R. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). K500E cells were transfected with the wild-type hRFC in pCDNA3 (designated pC43) to generate the K43-6 subline (32Wong S.C. McQuade R. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. Biochem.

These cells and all other hRFC transfectants (see below) were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium with 10% serum and antibiotics, plus 1 mg/ml G418 in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. For experiments in which hRFC-transfected cells were treated with tunicamycin to inhibit N-glycosylation, cells were continuously maintained in 3 μg/ml tunicamycin for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to experiment.

PCR conditions were 1 min at 94 °C for 1 cycle, followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 61 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The amplicon was digested with SfiI and XbaI and subcloned into SfiI/XbaI-digested pC43. hRFC-TMD1–6HA was prepared by PCR from the full-length hRFCHA6 construct in pCDNA3 (14Liu X.Y. Matherly L.H. Biochim. Biophys.

PCR conditions were 1 min at 94 °C for 1 cycle, 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 61 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a 7-min extension at 72°. The amplicon was digested with KpnI and XbaI and ligated into KpnI/XbaI-digested pCDNA3.1/Zeo (Invitrogen). hRFC-TMD7–12Myc-His10 was prepared by amplifying from pC43 with sense (SED89:5′-ATGGTGCCCTCCAGCCCAGCGGTGGAGAAGCAGGTGCCCG and TGGAACCTGGGAATCCCGGCCCAGGCGGGAAGCTGGG-3′) and antisense (RFC-Out12: 5′-GCACAGAGTGCAGGGGGAAGGGGTTGTC-3′) primers. The amplicon was cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) and reamplified with Kpn-RFC-UTR (5′-AGACCCAAGCTTGGTACCGACGTCCCCTCCGGAGCT and GCACGTGGCCTGAGCAGGATGGTGCCCTCCAGCCCAGCGGTGGAGAAGCAGGTGCCCGTGGAACCTGGG-3′) and RFC-Out12 primers. For both amplifications, PCR conditions were 1 min at 94 °C for 1 cycle, 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 61 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a 7-min extension at 72°. The amplicon was digested with KpnI and SfiI and ligated into KpnI/SfiI-digested hRFCMyc-His10 in pCDNA3.1. Constructs were transfected individually (hRFCMyc-His10, hRFC-TMD1–6HA, and hRFC-TMD7–12Myc-His10) or in combination (for hRFC-TMD1–6HA and hRFC-TMD7–12Myc-His10) into K500E cells with lipofectin (Invitrogen) and transfectants selected with 1 mg/ml G418. Individual clones were isolated, expanded, and screened on Western blots with HA-, Myc-, and hRFC-specific antibodies (see below). High expressing clones were selected for further study. Western Analysis of Mutant hRFC Transfectants—Plasma membranes were prepared by differential centrifugation (35Matherly L.H. Czajkowski C.A. Angeles S.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3420-3426PubMed Google Scholar). For standard Western blotting, membrane proteins were electrophoresed on 7.5 or 10% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Pierce) (39Matsudaira P.

For N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) digestions of plasma membrane proteins, samples were incubated at 37° overnight following denaturation for 10 min with 0.5% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, followed by addition of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, and N-glycosidase F (1 unit). Samples were diluted with 3× Laemmli sample buffer, fractionated on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and analyzed by Western blotting. Confocal Microscopy—For confocal microscopy, cells were fixed with 3.3% paraformaldehyde/DPBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies (see above), followed by a secondary goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes), as previously described (28Cao W.

Immunoprecipitation Protocol—For immunoprecipitations, membrane pellets (typically from 3 × 107 cells) were suspended in 500 radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (500 μl; 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1%SDS (pH 8)) (40Harlowe E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 424-470Google Scholar), including proteolytic inhibitors (35Matherly L.H. Czajkowski C.A. Angeles S.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3420-3426PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were precleared with 25 μl of protein G beads (EZview Red Protein G Affinity Gel; Sigma), then treated with 5 μg of Myc (Invitrogen) antibody for 1 h. Samples were immunoprecipitated with protein G beads, centrifuged, and the beads washed 3× with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Samples were eluted with 1× Laemmli sample buffer and fractionated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS for Western blotting. Membrane Transport Assays—Initial rates of [3H]Mtx or (6S)-5-CHO-[3H]H4PteGlu uptake were measured over 180 s, as previously described (9Wong S.C. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Levels of intracellular radioactivity were expressed as pmol/mg protein, calculated from direct measurements of radioactivity and protein contents of the cell homogenates. Protein assays were performed by the method of Lowry et al. (41Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic constants (Kt, Vmax) were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots. To assess the capacity of leucovorin to trans-stimulate Mtx influx via hRFC (32Wong S.C. McQuade R. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 42Goldman I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 233: 624-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cells were loaded with 50 μm leucovorin for 20 min at 37°, then washed with ice-cold DPBS (3×), and the cell pellets were stored at 0°. For transport assays, the cell pellets were warmed briefly to 37° and uptake initiated by rapid resuspension into Hank's balanced salts solution containing 0.5 μm [3H]Mtx. Affinity Labeling of hRFC with NHS-Mtx Ester—The preparation of unlabeled and radiolabeled NHS-Mtx was performed as described previously (33Henderson G.B. Zevely E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Matherly L.H. Czajkowski C.A. Angeles S.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3420-3426PubMed Google Scholar). The radiospecific activity of the NHS-[3H]Mtx was 28 Ci/mmol. For NHS-Mtx treatments, cells (∼5 × 107/ml) were suspended in 20 mm HEPES, 225 mm sucrose, pH 6.8 (with MgO) and were incubated with affinity reagent at 23° (while shaking) for 5 min. Cells were washed with DPBS and assayed for transport (see above) or, for NHS-[3H]Mtx-labeled cells, plasma membranes were prepared by differential centrifugation (35Matherly L.H. Czajkowski C.A. Angeles S.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3420-3426PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane pellets were solubilized in 1% SDS and fractionated on 1.5-mm 10% polyacrylamide gels with SDS, the gels sliced into 2-mm segments, and the pieces were suspended into 1 ml of Soluene-350 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) overnight at room temperature followed by 5 ml of Ready-value scintillation mixture (Beckman-Coulter). Radioactivity was detected on a Model 6500 Beckman liquid scintillation counter. In some experiments, the radioaffinity-labeled plasma membrane proteins were digested with endoproteinase GluC (New England Biolabs) using methods described by the manufacturer. The digests were fractionated for 20 h on 14.5% polyacrylamide gels with Tris-Tricine buffer (43Schagger H. von Jagon G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). The gels were sliced and processed for radioactivity measurements, as described above. Restoration of Transport Function by Co-expression of hRFC TMD1–6 and TMD1–7 Half-molecules—For hRFC, major portions of the TMD6/7 linker (amino acids 215–263 and 204–263) (Fig. 1) could be replaced with non-homologous segments (73 or 84 amino acids, respectively) of the structurally analogous SLC19A2 protein to preserve transport function (31Liu X.Y. Witt T.L. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 31-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because this suggested that the primary role of the linker region was to ensure optimal spacing between the TMD1–6 and TMD7–12 regions and was largely independent of amino acid sequence, we hypothesized that TMDs 1–6 and TMDs 7–12 could be expressed as separate polypeptides to restore transport function. Accordingly, a series of hRFC constructs were prepared including: (i) hRFC-TMD1–6HA, composed of 238 amino acids spanning TMDs1–6 and a 13 amino acid HA epitope insertion at Glu226 (Fig. 1B), and (ii) hRFC-TMD7–12Myc-His10, composed of 307 amino acids from Asn231 to Leu537 of hRFC and including an identical 5′-untranslated region and 18 N-terminal amino acids to the full-length hRFC (KS43) and hRFC-TMD1–6HA, and with a Myc-His10 epitope at the C terminus (Fig. 1C). Additional control constructs were designed to encompass TMDs 1–12 in their entirety along with specific epitope tags and included (iii) hRFCHA12, in which a HA epitope was inserted into the C terminus at Gln587 (14Liu X.Y. Matherly L.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1564: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Wong S.C. Zhang L. Proefke S.A. Matherly L.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1375: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and (iv) hRFCMyc-His10, in which a Myc-His10 epitope was inserted after Leu537. Constructs were transfected into hRFC-null K500E cells individually and, for hRFC-TMD1–6HA and hRFC-TMD7–12Myc-His10, together, and positive transfectants were selected with G418. Clonal isolates were screened for hRFC expression on Westerns with hRFC antibody (not shown) and with HA- and Myc-specific antibodies (Fig. 2A, upper and lower panels, respectively). Whereas high levels of hRFCHA12 (Fig. 2A, lane 1) and hRFCMyc-His10 (not shown) could be expressed in K500E cells, neither the singly expressed hRFC-TMD1–6HA nor hRFC-TMD7–12Myc-His10 proteins were detected (not shown). However, in co-transfections with hRFC-TMD1–6HA and hRFC-TMD7–12Myc-His10 constructs, both the amino and carboxyl half-proteins were identified in 2 clones (designated clones 3 and 5; lanes 3 and 4, respectively, in Fig. 2A) with HA- and Myc-specific antibodies. This implies a co-folding and stabilization of these forms. An association between the hRFC-TMD1–6HA and hRFC-TMD7–12Myc-His10 half-proteins was further implied by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in which hRFC-TMD1–6HA was immunoprecipitated with hRFC-TMD7–12Myc-His10 by Myc antibody (Fig. 3). By confocal analysis of dual-transfected cells with HA- and Myc-specific antibodies and Alexa488 staining, both the hRFC-TMD1–6HA and hRFC-TMD7–12Myc-His10 half-molecules were targeted to the plasma membrane, and there were no differences in staining with the hRFCHA12- and hRFCMyc-His10-transfected cells (Fig. 4). Moreover, no significant differential staining of intracellular structures was detected between the transfected lines.Fig. 3Co-immunoprecipitation of hRFC-TMD1–6HA and hRFC-TMD7–12Myc-His10 half-proteins. Membrane pellets from K500E transfectants expressing the hRFC-TMD1–6HA and hRFC-TMD7–12Myc-His10 half-molecules (clone 5) were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody (lane 1) or IgG (lane 2) and analyzed on Western blots as described under “Experimental Procedures” with anti-HA (upper panel) and anti-Myc (lower panel) antibodies. hRFCMyc-His10-transfected cells immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody were included as a positive control (lane 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4Confocal microscopy of hRFC-TMD1–6HA/TMD7–12Myc-His10, hRFCHA12, and hRFCMyc-His10 transfectants and hRFC-null K500E cells, showing localization to the plasma membrane. Cells were fixed with 3.3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, incubated with mouse anti-HA (hRFC-TMD1–6HA/TMD7–12Myc-His10 and hRFCHA12 transfectants, and K500E cells) or Myc (hRFC-TMD1–6HA/TMD7–12Myc-His10 and hRFCMyc-His10 transfectants, and K500E cells) primary antibodies followed by anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Ab), and spun onto microscope slides.

The canonical branch is one of three known branches. This is also valid in vitro, and Wnts can be considered beneficial for culturing primary cells from organs, provided Wnts are available and applicable even with cells of different species. It was shown here that internally c-myc-tagged murine Wnt-1 produced in the heterologous host Escherichia coli was appropriate for inducing intracellular signaling of the canonical Wnt pathway in eukaryotic cells via stabilization of cytosolic β-catenin. The pioneering injection of the protein into the blastocoels of Xenopus laevis embryos led to axis duplication and suppression of head formation. Applying the recombinant murine Wnt-1 to metanephric mesenchyme activated the tubulogenic program. The signalinducing activity of the recombinant protein was also positively demonstrated in the TOPflash reporter assay. Although Wnts were purified recently from the growth media of stably transfected eukaryotic cell lines, the production of active Wnt proteins in pro- or eukaryotic microorganisms reportedly has never been successful. Here soluble production in E. coli and translocation into the oxidizing environment of the periplasm were achieved. The protein was purified using the internal c-myc tag. The effect on the eukaryotic cells implies that activity was retained. Thus, this approach could make recombinant murine Wnt-1 available as a good starting point for other Wnts needed, for example, for maintaining and differentiating stem cells, organ restoration therapy, and tissue engineering.

The Wnt family consists of secreted and extracellular matrix-associated glycoproteins binding to frizzled seven-transmembrane span receptors (1Nusse R. Development. 2003; 130: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). There are two functional classes (Wnt-1 and Wnt-5a) within this family. The canonical intracellular signaling pathway induced by members of the Wnt-1 class leads to stabilization and nuclear translocation of cytosolic β-catenin that associates with the transcription factors lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell transcription factor (LEF/TCF) 1The abbreviations used are: TCF, T-cell transcription factor; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate. for activating the target genes (2Molenaar M. van de Wetering M.

Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar). The Wnt-5a class can induce two different pathways and can block the activity of the Wnt-1 class. Within the planar cell polarity pathway Jun N-terminal kinase is activated, and cytoskeletal organization and cell polarization are both activated and coordinated. In the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway, intracellular calcium is released most likely via G-proteins (4Huelsken J. Behrens J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3977-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 5Yamaguchi T.P. Curr.

The complex signaling network contributes to and regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and pattern formation. Canonical Wnt pathway activation (e.g. by Wnt-1, -3a, -7b, -8, and 8b but not by members of the Wnt-5a class) mediates the ectopic neural crest and secondary body axis formation in Xenopus embryos (5Yamaguchi T.P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R713-R724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 6Kühl M. Semin. Cell Dev.

The antagonists have dose-dependent effects. Low levels of frizzled-related proteins potentiate Wnt signaling, whereas high levels inhibit it (5Yamaguchi T.P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R713-R724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In vitro, the ligands induce signaling in cells of the respective species as well as in others. Drosophila Wingless and Xenopus Wnt-8 bind to several mouse frizzled receptors (8Karasawa T. Yokokura H. Kitajewski J. Lombroso P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37479-37486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and heterologous inducers (e.g. members of the wnt gene family) trigger tubulogenesis in metanephric mesenchyme cultures (9Kuure S.

Nineteen wnt genes have been identified already in the murine and human genome. 2Wnt gene home page, www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/wntwindow.html. The sequences of the human genes 3Swiss Protein Database, www.expasy.ch. have matches of 42–52%, and the proteins have matches of 26–39% if aligned with an 80% similarity significance value. Human Wnt-4 is the most similar to human Wnt-1, sharing 44% of the amino acid sequence similarly aligned. 3Swiss Protein Database, www.expasy.ch. One of the best characterized mammalian Wnts is murine Wnt-1 (13Bradley R.S. Brown A.M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4616-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It has four potential N-linked glycosylation sites and 23 conserved cysteines and is almost identical to human Wnt-1. There is only an isoleucine at position 40 in the mature murine protein (38.3 kDa) instead of valine. Both amino acids are neutral and hydrophobic. The aliphatic chain of isoleucine is longer just by a –CH2. The protein has an unprocessed precursor (41.1 kDa) including the signal sequence for the endoplasmic reticulum. The internal c-myc tag situated after the 49th amino acid in the processed protein adds 1.3 kDa to the molecular mass and decreases the pI slightly from 9.34 to 9.14. Wnt-1 class members, in concert with the antagonists, are considered to be beneficial for regulating stem cell development (e.g. hematopoietic, intestinal epithelium, epidermal, and hair follicle stem cells) and for maintaining them (5Yamaguchi T.P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R713-R724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 14Reya T. Duncan A.W. Ailles L. Domen J. Scherer D.C. Willert K. Hintz L. Nusse R. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). Future applications for this are found in regenerative tissue processes for human therapy. However, the availability of the proteinaceous reagents is limited. Production in eukaryotic cell cultures often results in accumulation of misfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, the proteins are associated with the extracellular matrix or the cell surface, and there is only a small soluble amount secreted. It is biologically active and useful in vitro.2 Murine Wnt-1 has been used, for instance, from conditioned medium but has not been purified (13Bradley R.S. Brown A.M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4616-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) because it has proven difficult to retain activity during the purification. This might be largely attributed to the high degree of insolubility/hydrophobicity (15Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates III, J.R. Nusse R. Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar) and instability.3 Only recently, Wnts were successfully purified from the growth media of stably transfected eukaryotic cell lines, and active murine Wnt-3a from mouse L cells and Drosophila Wnt-8 from Drosophila S2 cells were obtained (15Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates III, J.R. Nusse R. Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar). However, the production of active Wnt proteins in Escherichia coli, in yeasts, or with the baculovirus system has never been proven successful.2 Here, internally c-myc-tagged murine Wnt-1 could be purified using the tag after gaining soluble expression in E. coli and translocation into the oxidizing periplasm. Activity was retained as axis duplication and suppression of head formation in Xenopus laevis embryos, activation of the tubulogenic program in murine metanephric mesenchyme, expression of the luciferase gene in the TOPflash reporter assay, and stabilization of cytosolic β-catenin indicate the induction of the canonical Wnt pathway. Recombinant murine Wnt-1 could be made available for tissue engineering by the approach presented here and by the effects shown on eukaryotic cells. This might be the starting point for the use of E. coli as a recombinant host for the production of other Wnts. Construction of Plasmids—To construct pBFsswnt1myc (5543 bp) the mwnt-1myc gene of pgem4int-1mycpolyA (16McMahon A.P. Moon R.T. Cell. 1989; 58: 1075-1084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) was amplified by means of PCR using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-cctaggcctATGGGGCTCTGGGCGCTG-3′ (uppercase letters represent the native sequence, the StuI site is underlined, and the start codon is in boldface type) and 5′-tcaaagcttgaattcgagctcTCATAGACACTCGTGCAGAAC-3′ (uppercase letters represent the native sequence, the HindIII site is underlined, and the stop codon is in boldface type). The resulting 1176-bp fragment was digested with StuI and HindIII and inserted between the same restriction sites of pBF005 (17.Fahnert, B. (2001) Rekombinantes humanes BMP-2 aus Escherichia coli-Strategien zur Expression und Funktionalisierung. Doctoral thesis, Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena, Jena, GermanyGoogle Scholar). The plasmid (see Fig. 1C) encodes the mwnt-1myc precursor gene (with the corresponding signal sequence) with an lpp termination sequence under the control of ptac additionally regulated by lacIq under placI control, an f1 intergenic region, an ampicillin resistance marker, and the ColE1 origin. To construct pBFompAwnt1myc (5569 bp) the mwnt-1myc gene of pgem4int-1mycpolyA (16McMahon A.P. Moon R.T. Cell. 1989; 58: 1075-1084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) was amplified by means of PCR using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-agcgctagcGCCAACAGTAGTGGCCGATG-3′ (uppercase letters represent the native sequence, and the NheI site is underlined) and 5′-tcaaagcttgaattcgagctcTCATAGACACTCGTGCAGAAC-3′ (uppercase letters represent the native sequence, the HindIII site is underlined, and the stop codon is in boldface type). The resulting 1074-bp fragment was digested with NheI and HindIII and inserted between the same restriction sites of pBF005 (17.Fahnert, B. (2001) Rekombinantes humanes BMP-2 aus Escherichia coli-Strategien zur Expression und Funktionalisierung. Doctoral thesis, Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena, Jena, GermanyGoogle Scholar). The plasmid (see Fig. 1C) encodes the same genes as pBFsswnt1myc, but instead of the mwnt-1myc precursor gene (with the corresponding signal sequence) there is the sequence of the mature mwnt-1myc gene behind the signal sequence of the E. coli ompA gene.

This preculture was used to inoculate the main culture in the same medium to a starting optical density of 0.1 at 550 nm. The main culture was performed at 37 °C; protein production was induced with 1 mm IPTG when an optical density of 0.5 at 550 nm was reached, and cultivation was continued for 4 h. The cells were then harvested (8,500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). 0.9 g of cells were resuspended in 1.8 ml of PeriPreps periplasting buffer (PeriPreps™ periplasting kit, Epicentre) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. 2.25 ml of ice-cold purified water of the same kit were added, and everything was kept on ice for 10 min before being centrifuged (8,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was centrifuged again at the same parameters. Alternatively, the periplasmic fraction was extracted as follows for preparations not used in bioactivity assays. 650 mg of cells were resuspended in 50 ml of 20% Sucrose, 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl (all from Sigma) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before being centrifuged for 15 min at 8,000 × g and 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of ice-cold 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl and then incubated for 10 min on ice before being centrifuged for 15 min at 8,000 × g and 4 °C. Then the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 7.4. 1 ml of anti-c-Myc-agarose conjugate (Sigma) was used according to the manufacturer with some modifications for the purification. The slurry was packed in Polyprep chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) and equilibrated with 3 × 5 ml of PBS. After loading the sample, the column was washed with 3 × 5 ml of PBS, and the elution was performed with 9 × 1 ml of 0.1 m NH4OH (pH 11.5). For neutralization of the pH, 10 μl of 1 m acetic acid were needed for the first and 40 μl for the other fractions. The acid had been provided in the tubes for collecting the fractions. Centricon YM-50 centrifugal filter units (Millipore) were used for buffer exchange (5 × 2 ml of PBS) of the eluted fractions 1–3 and for concentration according to the manufacturer. Roti-Nanoquant (Carl Roth) was used for determining protein concentrations as described by the manufacturer. Immunoblot—Samples were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore). The low range SDS-PAGE molecular weight standard from Bio-Rad was used. The membranes were blocked with 3% skimmed milk powder in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibodies (clone 9E10, mouse ascites fluid, Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies against mouse Ig (Amersham Biosciences) were used and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence on Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). Hydrophobicity Assay—The soluble fraction of the whole cell extract in PBS was prepared by centrifugation after ultrasonication and kept on ice. Then 750 μl of the extract were mixed with 750 μl of ice-cold Triton X-114 (Amersham Biosciences) before the mixture was incubated at 30 °C until complete phase separation took place. Samples from both phases were then taken. Additionally, a sample from the Triton phase was precipitated using acetone (80% final concentration) overnight at –20 °C. After centrifugation, the pellet was dried and resuspended in PBS. Distribution in the Cellular Compartments—After producing the protein as described above, an amount of the bacterial culture corresponding to an optical density of 10 at 600 nm was harvested and resuspended in 500 μl of PeriPreps periplasting buffer (PeriPreps™ periplasting kit, Epicentre). The fractions of the cellular compartments were prepared according to the manufacturer using ultracentrifugation (138,000 × g, 1 h) at the end for separating the cytoplasmic fraction from membranes. The pelleted membranes were then resuspended in 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA. Injection Experiments in X. laevis—X. laevis embryos were obtained by in vitro fertilization and raised in 25% modified Marc's Ringer (20Peng H.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) at 18 °C. Embryos at the four-cell stage were injected with 18 nl of the samples of protein to be tested or the negative control (see above) in the ventral blastomeres. Alternatively, embryos at stage 7–8 were injected with 50 nl into the blastocoel (as indicated in Fig. 5A (adapted from Ref. 21Wolpert L. Beddington R. Brokes J. Jessel T. Lawrence P. Meyerowitz E. Principles of Development. 1st Ed. Current Biology Ltd., London1998: 28Google Scholar)). All of the embryos were kept for 6 h in 25% modified Marc's Ringer with 3% Ficoll (Amersham Biosciences) at 18 °C, then were raised in 25% modified Marc's Ringer at 18 °C, and were fixed at tail bud stage in 100 mm Mops, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 4% paraformaldehyde before being analyzed for the formation of a secondary axis. Embryos were staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (22Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). North Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1976Google Scholar). Metanephric Mesenchyme Assay—CD-1 mice embryos (E 11.5) were collected into PBS on ice. To obtain timed embryos the vaginal plug was considered a criterion for mating. The kidneys were dissected and kept in PBS on ice. Following incubation in 3% pancreatin, trypsin (Sigma) in Tyrode's solution for 30 s on ice, they were transferred to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) for 10–15 min to regenerate. Then the epithelium (ureter bud) was microsurgically separated from the metanephric mesenchyme, and the mesenchymes were transferred from the medium onto Nuclepore filters supported by a stainless steel grid in a culture dish (1 mesenchyme/well). Mesenchyme cultures were performed according to Vainio et al. (23Vainio S. Karavanova I. Jowett A. Thesleff I. Cell. 1993; 75: 45-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) in 300 μl of the same medium with serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 5% CO2 in humidified air at 37 °C for 23 h. Before cultivation, the purified samples of recombinant protein to be tested or the negative control (see above) to a final concentration of 1:10–1:30, or the positive control (15 mm LiCl) were added directly to the medium and mixed gently, avoiding bubbles. TOPflash Assay—MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (BioWhittaker), and 1mm sodium pyruvate (BioWhittaker) with 5% CO2 in humidified air at 37 °C. Cells (140,000 in 500 μl of medium/well) were seeded in 24-well plates the day before transfection and were transfected at about 95% confluency with 300 ng of pTop-Flash (luciferase reporter plasmid; Refs. 24van de Wetering M.

The culture medium was changed after 6 h of incubation against 500 μl of the same medium plus 100 units ml–1 penicillin and 100 μgml–1 streptomycin sulfate. Then 10 μl of the purified samples of recombinant protein to be tested (sample dilutions of 1:1, 1:5, 1:10, and 1:20 resulting in final concentrations of 1:50, 1:250, 1:500, and 1:1,000), the negative control (see above), or the positive control (20 mm LiCl) were added in duplicate, and the plates were incubated for 18 h. The wells were washed twice with PBS, and then the cells were lysed using 1× cell culture lysis reagent (Promega) for 15 min. Luciferase activities were measured by means of a luminometer using 20 μl of the cell lysate and 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer. β-Galactosidase activities were measured spectrophotometrically at 574 nm using 20 μl of the cell lysate and the substrate chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside following the instructions of the high sensitivity β-galactosidase assay kit (Stratagene). β-Catenin Stabilization Assay—MDCK cells were cultured as described above (TOPflash assay). The cells (130,000 in 500 μl of medium/well) were seeded in 24-well plates the day before the assay. At a confluency of 80–90% the medium was changed against 500 μl of the same medium plus 100 units ml–1 penicillin and 100 μg ml–1 streptomycin sulfate. Then 10 μl of the purified samples of recombinant protein to be tested (sample dilutions of 1:1, 1:5, 1:10, and 1:20 resulting in final concentrations of 1:50, 1:250, 1:500, and 1:1,000), the negative control (see above), or the positive control (20 mm LiCl) were added in duplicate. After the plates had been incubated for 2.5 h, the cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-114 (Sigma)). Then the samples were subjected to immunoblotting as described above, but antibodies against active β-catenin (clone 8E7, mouse monoclonal, Upstate) were used as the first antibody according to the manufacturer. Internally c-myc-tagged Murine Wnt-1 Can Be Produced Solubly in E. coli—Wnt proteins have been purified from conditioned medium of eukaryotic cell lines and found to be active as stem cell growth factors (15Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates III, J.R. Nusse R. Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar) but have not been produced in a prokaryotic host. We intended to study whether a member of the Wnt family produced in E. coli was appropriate for inducing intracellular signaling of the canonical Wnt pathway in eukaryotic cells. Therefore, expression vectors encoding the mwnt-1myc precursor gene with its own signal sequence (pBFsswnt1myc) or the signal sequence of the E. coli ompA gene (pBFompAwnt1myc) for directing the protein to the periplasm were constructed. The accumulation of the product in the oxidizing periplasm favors correct folding of cysteine-rich proteins such as Wnt-1 (23 cysteines). The two different signal sequence variants were chosen to study their impact on production, solubility, and folding. The signal sequence of eukaryotic proteins can act as a steric chaperone supporting the correct folding, and in some cases it also signals in E. coli (17.Fahnert, B. (2001) Rekombinantes humanes BMP-2 aus Escherichia coli-Strategien zur Expression und Funktionalisierung. Doctoral thesis, Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena, Jena, GermanyGoogle Scholar, 26Humphreys D.P. Weir N. Mountain A. Lund P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28210-28215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The signal sequence of the homologous OmpA was used because it could possibly be more efficient in avoiding bottlenecks in translocation and by this prevent aggregation in the cytoplasm. The ptac was used because its strength can be fine tuned and because its basic expression is minimized by LacIq. The target protein production was studied in the strain RV308. The most stable product was obtained by growing the cells in rich medium (Superbroth) at 37 °C with an inducer concentration of 1 mm IPTG and an induction time of 4 h. However, some unspecific proteolysis could not be circumvented. Whole cell extract was separated into soluble and insoluble fractions by centrifugation after ultrasonication and was analyzed by means of Western blotting to assess the solubility of the product. In Fig. 1, it is shown that up to 50% of the produced target protein was soluble. Although more recombinant protein was produced using the plasmid pBFompAwnt1myc (up to 3× the amount produced using pBFsswnt1myc), the final yield in the soluble product was not much higher because it was less soluble (up to 17%). Soluble Murine Wnt-1 Extracted from the E. coli Periplasm Can Be Purified Using the Internal c-myc Tag—Translocation into the periplasm was achieved with both vector systems, and soluble target protein could be extracted from this compartment for further purification using the internal c-myc tag. In Fig. 2, it is shown that target protein specifically bound to anti-c-Myc-conjugated agarose, whereas a smaller proteolysis product did not. Excessive protein was washed off. The bound protein could be eluted here mainly in the second and third fraction using 0.1 m NH4OH (pH 11.5). Some protein stayed bound to the resin. After elution, the protein was contained in an ammonium acetate solution inappropriate for later application as a cytokine, and thus the buffer had to be exchanged for PBS. This could be done by means of centrifugal filter units with a cutoff of 50 kDa. It was found that the protein accumulated exclusively in the retentate even though it is smaller than 50 kDa. On the average, 0.8 μg of protein were contained in the retentate after processing 900 mg of cells. The content varied depending on culture conditions and lot of the resin. The amount of active protein was presumably lower because the folding state of the produced protein might be heterogeneous. Murine Wnt-1 with an Internal c-myc Tag Recombinantly Produced in E. coli Is Hydrophobic—It was published recently that Wnt proteins are palmitoylated in their active forms increasing membrane association (15Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates III, J.R. Nusse R. Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar). The murine Wnt-1 produced here in E. coli was subjected to temperature-induced Triton X-114 phase extraction to assess its hydrophobicity. At temperatures below 20 °C, Triton X-114 dissolves in aqueous buffers. Above 20 °C the mixture separates into a detergent and an aqueous phase. Hydrophobic proteins partition to the organic phase, and hydrophilic ones accumulate in the aqueous phase (27Corporation Promega eNotes. Removal of Endotoxin Contamination from Plasmid DNA, Madison, WI2004: 0021Google Scholar). The soluble fraction of the whole cell extract including the produced target protein was mixed with Triton X-114. After separation the phases were analyzed by means of Western blotting. Recombinant target protein was found in the detergent phase as depicted in Fig. 3. This indicated hydrophobicity. Fractions of the cellular compartments were prepared to find out whether the protein also associates with membranes. In Fig. 4, the distribution of the produced protein in the cell is shown. There were only traces of protein in the cytoplasm. Most of it accumulated in the periplasm or associated with the membranes. There was less target protein free in the periplasm than associated with the membrane when it was translocated due to its own signal sequence. It was vice versa for the product translocated using the E. coli ompA signal sequence.Fig. 4Murine Wnt-1 with an internal c-myc tag is translocated to the periplasm of E. coli and can associate with the membrane.E. coli RV308 harboring pBFsswnt1myc or pBFompAwnt1myc was harvested after growth at 37 °C in Superbroth and protein production for 4 h. The fractions of the cellular compartments (P, soluble periplasmic fraction; C, soluble cytoplasmic fraction; M, membrane fraction) were prepared and analyzed after separation by means of Western blotting. (The first antibody was anti-c-Myc from mouse, and the secondary antibody was anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase.) The migration positions of molecular weight markers are shown on the left.

https://openalex.org/W2007034360,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors and plays a key role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Current therapies include the use of antiandrogens aimed at inhibiting the transcriptional activation of AR-regulated genes by AR. Here, we explore a strategy aimed at obtaining silencing of AR-regulated genes, based on the properties of the transcriptional repressor promyelocytic leukamia zinc-finger protein (PLZF). In order to do this, we have made a fusion protein between PLZF and AR, named PLZF-AR, and show that PLZF-AR is able to bring about silencing of genomically encoded AR-regulated genes and inhibit the androgen-regulated growth of LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Together, our results show that this strategy is able to bring about potent repression of AR-regulated responses and, therefore, could be of value in the development of new therapies for prostate cancer."

A regulatory protein without known catalytic activity, PAI-1 modulates plasminogen activators through protein-protein interactions. Although global conformational alterations that occur in PAI-1 determine its regulatory activity, comprehensive assessments of concurrent dynamic, structural, and functional alterations of this critical regulatory protein have not yet been clearly defined. X-ray crystallographic studies have described four distinct PAI-1 conformational states: active, latent, reactive center loop peptide-annealed (RCL-PA), and cleaved mutant. In this study, backbone amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange detected by mass spectrometry was used to characterize dynamic and structural alterations of human PAI-1 (hPAI-1) in relation to its function. hPAI-1 conformers were defined by surface mapping the solvent-accessible sites for strategic secondary structural components of the protein. We observed a global protection from solvent for a majority of peptides in the latent conformer relative to the active conformer. Significant differences were observed in the RCL, helix A, helix D, and sheet 1C, and these regions were markedly more dynamic or solvent-exposed in the active conformation. The RCL-PA form adopts an intermediate conformational state between the active and the latent conformers. Our results demonstrate that the most dynamic regions of PAI-1 (the RCL, helices D and A, and sheet 5A) are flexible in the transition toward latency. They also show that the dynamic surface structures of the active, latent, and peptide-annealed conformers of PAI-1 are underestimated by theoretical solvent accessibility calculations derived from crystallographic data.

As a member of the serine protease inhibitor family, PAI-1 serves as a major inhibitor of the proteases tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) (4Alessi M.C.

Recent clinical studies suggest important links between PAI-1 and accelerated development of atherosclerosis and a prothrombotic state, with attendant enhanced risks for development of myocardial infarction, stroke, and thromboembolic events (6Koppel K.

Animal model studies further demonstrate that PAI-1 plays a critical role in ventricular remodeling following an acute myocardial infarction, a process important in the development of heart failure (10Askari A.T.

The many links between PAI-1, cardiovascular disease, and thrombosis have thus made this regulatory protein a recent focus of intense research interest. Despite this, the structural and dynamic conformational alterations that underlie the regulatory functions of PAI-1 are incompletely understood.In vivo, synthesized PAI-1 is secreted and bound to an adhesive, stabilizing glycoprotein, vitronectin, in a noncovalent complex (11Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.C. Baudner S. Paques E.P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PAI-1 bound to vitronectin remains folded in an “active” conformation, as defined by its ability to bind and inhibit plasminogen activators. When unbound to vitronectin, PAI-1 undergoes a slow spontaneous conversion (t½ ≅2 h, 37 °C) into an inactive “latent” conformation that no longer is capable of binding to and inhibiting plasminogen activators (5Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundstrom T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Lawrence D.A. Strandberg L. Ericson J. Ny T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active form of PAI-1 can be partially regenerated from the latent form by undergoing refolding transitions under kinetically controlled denaturation conditions (14Wang Z. Mottonen J. Goldsmith E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16443-16448Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Because of its size of 45 kDa, decoding the structural changes involved in the conformational alterations of PAI-1 has been relegated mostly to x-ray crystallography. Three-dimensional studies by x-ray crystallography have revealed the structure of the latent form (15Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), a cleaved form (16Aertgeerts K. De Bondt H.L. De Ranter C. Declerck P.J. Proteins. 1995; 23: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), an engineered active form (17Nar H. Bauer M. Stassen J.M. Lang D. Gils A. Declerck P.J. J. Mol.

Sjolin L. Deinum J. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 627-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These structures reveal that the RCL is solvent-exposed, protruding from one end of the elongated molecule in the active form, and markedly unexposed in the latent form. Accompanying this conformational change is the insertion of the RCL during latency as β-sheet 4A into a well packed scaffold of 9 α-helices and 3 β-sheets (15Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3643-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A conformer of PAI-1 with substrate binding properties has been mimicked by annealing PAI-1 to an N-acetylated octapeptide comprised of the N-terminal residues from the RCL (N-Ac-TVASSSTA, P14 –P7, T333–A340), resulting in loss of PAI-1 activity (i.e. inhibition of PAI-1 binding to and inhibition of plasminogen activators) (19Xue Y. Bjorquist P. Inghardt T. Linschoten M. Musil D. Sjolin L. Deinum J. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 627-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, a smaller pentapeptide fragment (TVASS, P14 –P10, residue T333–S337) was also used to generate a substrate mimic bound to PAI-1 (19Xue Y. Bjorquist P. Inghardt T. Linschoten M. Musil D.

Results from studies of these substrate mimics show that PAI-1 functions as a protease inhibitor via a “bait” peptide bond (P1–P1′, R346–M347) on its RCL that imitates the binding site of the plasminogen activator substrate (20Shore J.D.

An ester bond is formed between the active site serine residue of the protease and the carboxyl group of the methionine residue (P′) of the RCL.

However, dynamic studies reported to date only focus upon specific residues or regions of PAI-1 and lack the ability to monitor cooperative processes involved in global conformational changes throughout the full protein.In this report we have supplemented prior structural studies of PAI-1 by using backbone amide hydrogen/deuterium (1H → 2H) exchange coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for studying protein dynamics and conformational alterations in relation to function (33Woods Jr., V.L. Hamuro Y. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 2001; 37: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 34Smith D.L. Deng Y. Zhang Z. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The backbone amide protons provide individualized probes spanning the entire protein sequence, which when deuterium-labeled can be used to monitor changes in conformational and dynamic states throughout the polypeptide chain (36Deng Y. Zhang Z. Smith D.L. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 10: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). By exchanging the labile backbone protons to deuterium (1H → 2H exchange) at neutral pH, quenching exchange by acidification, which reduces amide proton exchange rate by nearly 10 orders of magnitude (34Smith D.L. Deng Y. Zhang Z. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), cooling, and then immediately performing pepsin digestion coupled to reverse phase HPLC with on-line electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, a “painted” surface or “footprint” of the protein showing the sites that become solvent-accessible during D2O exposure are characterized. Comparison of the 1H → 2H exchange patterns of peptic peptides from different conformational states of PAI-1 has allowed identification of site-specific structural alterations throughout the polypeptide backbone that occur in PAI-1 as it undergoes the transition from active to latent to substrate-bound forms. Molecular models are generated by superimposing experimentally measured 1H → 2H exchange factors onto existing x-ray crystal structure scaffolds, permitting identification of important dynamic constraints governing interconversion between the various conformational states of PAI-1.MATERIALS AND METHODSRecombinant wild type human plasminogen activator type 1 produced from Escherichia coli (98% active) was purchased from Molecular Innovations Inc. (Southfield, MI). uPA and the uPA-specific chromogenic substrate (Spectrozyme, UK) were purchased from American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT. Immobilized pepsin on cross-linked agarose (6%, 2–3 mg of pepsin/ml of gel) was obtained from Pierce. Deuterium oxide (D2O; 99 atom % D) and acetic acid (99.9 + %) were from Aldrich. Trifluoroacetic acid (certified grade) was from Fisher. Ammonium acetate (ACS grade) was obtained from ACROS Organics (Morris Plains, NJ), and acetonitrile (HPLC grade), HEPES, urea, and guanidinium chloride were obtained from Sigma. The RCL peptide, N-Ac-TVASSSTA, was synthesized and purified, and its sequence was confirmed at the Molecular Biotechnology Core of the Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation.Generation and Functional Confirmation of PAI-1 Conformational States—Activity assays in control studies demonstrated that the active form of PAI-1 (purchased as >95% active) stored in a solution containing 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, and 50 mm EDTA had a half-life of 12 h after thawing to 20 °C and diluting into working buffer. The latent form of PAI-1 was obtained by incubating the native form of PAI-1 (purchased as 20% active) for 24 h at room temperature. The RCL-PA conformation (substrate mimic) of PAI-1 was obtained by incubating active PAI-1 for 24 h at room temperature with a 10-fold excess of N-Ac-TVASSTA in 0.1 m HEPES buffer at pH 7.4. This peptide mimics the critical stretch of amino acids of the RCL that serves as bait and therefore deters latency formation by sterically hindering the insertion of the RCL. Immediately prior to use, the functional states of the active and the conformationally altered forms of PAI-1 were confirmed by a chromogenic PAI-1 activity assay following 15 min of incubation with uPA. PAI-1 activities were defined as a function of inhibition in the initial rate of uPA activity relative to residual uPA activity observed in the absence of added PAI-1, as described previously (10Askari A.T. Brennan M.L. Zhou X. Drinko J. Morehead A. Thomas J.D. Topol E.J. Hazen S.L. Penn M.S. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).PAI-1 Activity Assay—hPAI-1 (72 nm) in each of its three conformational states was individually incubated for 15 min at 25 °C in reaction mixtures containing uPA (24 μg/ml, 2000 IU urokinase), 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and 0.02 mm CaCl2. Replicates of incubated mixtures were then transferred individually to single wells of a 96-well plate containing the uPA-specific chromogenic substrate (Spectrozyme UK; American Diagnostica, Inc.) and calcium chloride (final concentration of 5 and 400 μm, respectively). PAI-1 activity was monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring the initial rate of residual uPA activity by following real time changes in absorbance at 405 nm and 25 °C for 15 min, during which time interval absorption changes were approximately linear under the conditions employed. Initial velocities of reactions were calculated from the slopes of best fit curves using instrument software. PAI-1 activity is expressed as the percent inhibition of uPA activity relative to reactions run in the absence of PAI-1. 0% PAI-1 activity was defined as uninhibited uPA activity (as determined by sham incubations in the absence of PAI-1). 100% PAI-1 activity was defined by the assay system devoid of uPA. Assays points were routinely performed in triplicate with results reported as the mean ± S.D. % inhibition of uPA activity. Data shown are results (mean ± S.D.) from experiments performed at least three independent times.Backbone Amide 1H → 2H Exchange (Pulse Labeling)—Pulse labeling by 1H → 2H exchange was done on 5-μl aliquots of 2.0 mg/ml solutions of active, latent, and RCL-PA PAI-1 conformers. Samples were equilibrated at room temperature for 10 min prior to exchange. Each PAI-1 sample was pulse-labeled by the addition of a 20-fold excess volume of deuterated solution comprised of 50 mm ND4OAc, pD 6.5, in D2O for 10 s. Deuterium labeling of PAI-1 samples was quenched by rapid reduction of the pH and temperature by addition of 10 μl of quenching solution (10% trifluoroacetic acid, 8 m guanidine hydrochloride, pH 2.2, 0 °C) and immersion in ice/water/methanol bath (–10 °C). Control studies demonstrated that addition of guanidine hydrochloride to the quenching solution under the conditions employed (guanidine hydrochloride, 0.4 m final) did not measurably impact upon measured peptide 1H → 2H exchange, yet facilitated more efficient pepsin digestion. The final pH of the solutions after quenching was pH 2.5, optimal for minimizing back exchange (34Smith D.L. Deng Y. Zhang Z. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar).Pepsin Digestion of Labeled PAI-1 Samples—Immediately following pulse labeling, PAI-1 was rapidly digested under conditions that minimize back exchange in 40 μl of pre-washed and pre-chilled agarose-immobilized pepsin for 5 min. Following digestion, samples were immediately filtered in 0.22-μm ultrafree centrifugal filter devices for 1 min in a biofuge set at –2 °C. Filtered samples were immediately injected on-line and analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The entire process from pulse labeling to mass spectrometric analysis occurred within 15 min.HPLC with On-line Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Modified PAI-1 Residues—A Phenomenex reverse phase C18 (1 mm × 15 cm) column on a micro-HPLC system equipped with a binary pump (Micro-Tech Scientific, Vista, CA) interfaced to a Finnigan (San Jose, CA) liquid chromatography ion trap DECA™ mass spectrometer was used for separation and mass spectrometric analysis of peptic peptides. The injector, analytical column, tubings, and solvents were all immersed in ice/water bath during analysis to minimize back exchange. The column was equilibrated at a flow rate of 50 μl/min with 2% solvent B (solvent A, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O; solvent B, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) prior to injecting a 20-μl aliquot of the sample with a pre-chilled syringe. Peptides were eluted following a 1-min desalting step using 40% solvent B over 6 min, followed by a linear gradient over the next 4 min to 80% solvent B.To identify and sequence all peptic peptides, mass spectra were initially collected for an unlabeled pepsin-digested PAI-1 sample with sequences searched against the data base Sequest (La Jolla, CA). Corresponding mass spectra with well resolved isotopic peaks of deuterium-labeled peptides were then obtained in duplicate using full scan mode of analysis for the following mass ranges: 300 –1000, 1000 –1600, and 1400 –2000 m/z. This process was also applied to a functional maximally labeled PAI-1 sample, denoted as 100% exchanged (achieved by incubating PAI-1 in D2O buffer overnight at 37 °C), as well as a nonlabeled sample of PAI-1, denoted as 0% exchanged. Data were processed using the Finnigan Xcalibur software, and deuterium content of labeled peptides was calculated from the difference between labeled and unlabeled mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) values of the peptic peptide centroids, as described below.Quantitation of 1H → 2H Exchange into PAI-1 Peptides—The extent of 1H → 2H exchange into PAI-1 peptides in its three conformational states was quantified as the deuterium content (D), as shown in Equation 1. Minimal back-exchange of the labeled amide protons to unlabeled protons occurs during digestion as well as during the chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric analysis. To correct for this phenomenon, a normalization factor was implemented in the calculations for deuterium content using a functional maximally labeled peptide (34Smith D.L. Deng Y. Zhang Z. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The deuterium content is therefore an established corrected measure of the number of deuteriums incorporated by 1H → 2H exchange into proteins (34Smith D.L. Deng Y. Zhang Z. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar),D=〈m〉−〈m0%〉〈m100%〉−〈m0%〉×N(Eq.1) where 〈m0%〉, 〈m〉, and m100% represent the average molecular masses of the unlabeled peptide (0% exchange), the partially deuterated (exchange by conformation), and the functional maximally deuterated peptide (100% exchange), respectively, and N represents the number of amino acid residues in the peptide.Molecular Graphics and Sequence Analysis—Accelrys Viewerlite50 (Norwalk, CT) was used to color code and display the three-dimensional crystal structures from the respective protein data base (PDB) files. Solvent accessibility values were color-coded based on the analogous color scheme for anisotropic temperature (B) factors. Typically, these B factors give a measure of the mobility or uncertainty of the position of a given atom (35, Schneider, T. R. (1996) in Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend (Dodsen, E., Moore, M., Ralph, A., and Bailey, S., eds) pp. 133–144, SERC Davesbury Laboratory, Daresbury, UKGoogle Scholar). High solvent accessibility values are colored in warmer (red) colors and lower values in colder (blue) colors. Differences in excess of 50% between the active and the RCL-PA PAI-1 conformers relative to the latent conformer were illustrated on their respective crystal structures using this color scheme.Experimentally determined 1H → 2H exchange deuterium contents of each peptide were compared with theoretical relative solvent accessibility (RSA) values. These RSA values were calculated by entering the PDB x, y, and z coordinates and atomic radii into GETAREA 1.1 (Sealy Center for Structural Biology, Galveston, TX). To differentiate between theoretical RSA values and 1H → 2H exchange derived deuterium factors (an index for experimental solvent accessibility), the crystal structures were adapted using distinct color codes. The calculated values for both the theoretical and experimentally derived RSA values were normalized to the largest value in each category. The normalized values were distributed roughly into tertiles ranging from ±0 to 20% (in gray), ±20 to 60% ((+) in orange and (–) in light blue)), and ±60 –100% ((+) in red and (–) in dark blue)). Regions in red and orange show enhanced experimentally determined solvent accessibility (1H → 2H) values for a given PAI-1 conformer relative to theoretical RSA values derived from crystallographic data. Regions in gray show no significant differences between experimental (1H → 2H) and theoretical RSA values, whereas regions in light and dark blue depict protein regions where experimentally determined solvent accessibility (1H → 2H) was less than that estimated by crystallographic theoretical RSA calculations.RESULTSConformational States of PAI-1—Prior to deuterium labeling studies, confirmatory functional assessments were performed on active, latent, and RCL-PA PAI-1 conformers. Fig. 1 shows a plot of % PAI-1 activity measured for each PAI-1 conformer. Consistent with expectations, the active conformer of PAI-1 retained 95.2 ± 11.1% activity (i.e. inhibited uPA activity 95.2%), the latent conformer possessed only 9.8 ± 8.3% PAI-1 activity, and the RCL-PA conformer had minimal (1.1 ± 8.0%) residual PAI-1 activity (i.e. failed to significantly inhibit uPA activity).Mass Spectrometric Characterization and Sequence Coverage of PAI-1—An important requirement of the use of 1H → 2H amide exchange as a structural probe of proteins is maximal sequence coverage of the protein. To achieve this, PAI-1 was digested with pepsin, which rapidly cleaves diverse sites of proteins at low pH and at low temperature. By collision-induced dissociation-ESI-mass spectrometry, product ions of the peptic peptides were analyzed for sequence determination. An illustrative collision-induced dissociation spectrum of a PAI-1 peptic peptide (L46 –Q59, correlation factor 4.95) is shown in Fig. 2. Greater than 90% of hPAI-1 sequence was covered by ESI tandem mass spectrometry for all conformers studied. The peptides underlined (Fig. 3) were all well resolved when scanned and studied by 1H → 2H exchange/mass spectrometry for each of the active, latent, and RCL-PA conformers of PAI-1.Fig. 2Collision-induced dissociation mass spectrum of a peptic peptide (L46 –Q59). PAI-1 was digested with immobilized pepsin in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio and analyzed on an ion trap mass spectrometer using a data-dependent four-segment fragmentation mode. The charged fragment ions were used for sequence analysis and peptide mapping by using the SEQUEST data base search program. Shown are the representative N-terminal ions (b ions) and the C-terminal ions (y ions"
