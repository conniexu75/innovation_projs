https://openalex.org/W2074179519,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope (Env) spike, comprising three gp120 and three gp41 subunits, is a conformational machine that facilitates HIV-1 entry by rearranging from a mature unliganded state, through receptor-bound intermediates, to a post-fusion state. As the sole viral antigen on the HIV-1 virion surface, Env is both the target of neutralizing antibodies and a focus of vaccine efforts. Here we report the structure at 3.5 Å resolution for an HIV-1 Env trimer captured in a mature closed state by antibodies PGT122 and 35O22. This structure reveals the pre-fusion conformation of gp41, indicates rearrangements needed for fusion activation, and defines parameters of immune evasion and immune recognition. Pre-fusion gp41 encircles amino- and carboxy-terminal strands of gp120 with four helices that form a membrane-proximal collar, fastened by insertion of a fusion peptide-proximal methionine into a gp41-tryptophan clasp. Spike rearrangements required for entry involve opening the clasp and expelling the termini. N-linked glycosylation and sequence-variable regions cover the pre-fusion closed spike; we used chronic cohorts to map the prevalence and location of effective HIV-1-neutralizing responses, which were distinguished by their recognition of N-linked glycan and tolerance for epitope-sequence variation."
https://openalex.org/W2031855875,"It is currently thought that life-long blood cell production is driven by the action of a small number of multipotent haematopoietic stem cells. Evidence supporting this view has been largely acquired through the use of functional assays involving transplantation. However, whether these mechanisms also govern native non-transplant haematopoiesis is entirely unclear. Here we have established a novel experimental model in mice where cells can be uniquely and genetically labelled in situ to address this question. Using this approach, we have performed longitudinal analyses of clonal dynamics in adult mice that reveal unprecedented features of native haematopoiesis. In contrast to what occurs following transplantation, steady-state blood production is maintained by the successive recruitment of thousands of clones, each with a minimal contribution to mature progeny. Our results demonstrate that a large number of long-lived progenitors, rather than classically defined haematopoietic stem cells, are the main drivers of steady-state haematopoiesis during most of adulthood. Our results also have implications for understanding the cellular origin of haematopoietic disease."

https://openalex.org/W2107293238,"X-ray pulsations with an average period of 1.37 seconds have been detected from a known ultraluminous X-ray source hitherto thought to be a black hole; the pulsations instead unequivocally identify the source as an accreting magnetized neutron star ten times brighter than any previously known. Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are non-nuclear point sources that are widely believed to contain either intermediate mass black holes or smaller, stellar mass black holes accreting from a binary companion. The study of ULXs provides information about black hole formation and/or modes of high Eddington rate accretion. Two papers in this issue of Nature describe pulsating ULXs with unusual properties. Christian Motch et al. find that source P13 in the galaxy NGC 7793 is in a ∼64 day period binary system. By modelling the strong optical and UV modulations arising from X-ray heating of the B9Ia donor star, they constrain the black hole mass to be less than 15 solar masses. Matteo Bachetti et al. observe a source in the galaxy M82 that, the pulsation data imply, harbours a neutron star rather than a black hole, raising doubts over the assumption that black holes power the most luminous X-ray binaries. The majority of ultraluminous X-ray sources are point sources that are spatially offset from the nuclei of nearby galaxies and whose X-ray luminosities exceed the theoretical maximum for spherical infall (the Eddington limit) onto stellar-mass black holes1,2. Their X-ray luminosities in the 0.5–10 kiloelectronvolt energy band range from 1039 to 1041 ergs per second3. Because higher masses imply less extreme ratios of the luminosity to the isotropic Eddington limit, theoretical models have focused on black hole rather than neutron star systems1,2. The most challenging sources to explain are those at the luminous end of the range (more than 1040 ergs per second), which require black hole masses of 50–100 times the solar value or significant departures from the standard thin disk accretion that powers bright Galactic X-ray binaries, or both. Here we report broadband X-ray observations of the nuclear region of the galaxy M82 that reveal pulsations with an average period of 1.37 seconds and a 2.5-day sinusoidal modulation. The pulsations result from the rotation of a magnetized neutron star, and the modulation arises from its binary orbit. The pulsed flux alone corresponds to an X-ray luminosity in the 3–30 kiloelectronvolt range of 4.9 × 1039 ergs per second. The pulsating source is spatially coincident with a variable source4 that can reach an X-ray luminosity in the 0.3–10 kiloelectronvolt range of 1.8 × 1040 ergs per second1. This association implies a luminosity of about 100 times the Eddington limit for a 1.4-solar-mass object, or more than ten times brighter than any known accreting pulsar. This implies that neutron stars may not be rare in the ultraluminous X-ray population, and it challenges physical models for the accretion of matter onto magnetized compact objects."
https://openalex.org/W2147917005,"HIV's shape-shifting envelope protein HIV's envelope protein (Env) coats virus particles and allows HIV to enter host cells. HIV entry is highly dynamic. Env proteins work in groups of three (called trimers), which bind to the viral receptor and co-receptor, both expressed by host cells. Viral receptor binding causes a structural rearrangement in the trimer that allows for co-receptor binding and finally, viral entry. To visualize dynamic changes in Env conformation during viral entry, Munro et al. added differently colored fluorescent tags to two different regions of individual HIV trimers. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance entry transfer revealed three distinct Env conformations before cell entry. Occupation of particular conformations depended on host receptor binding.

https://openalex.org/W1989540449,"R-loops, which have been considered to be rare and potentially harmful transcriptional by-products, are now shown to be needed for antisense transcription and to induce repressive chromatin marks that reinforce pausing of transcription and thereby enhance its termination. The invasion of a DNA duplex by an RNA molecule results in a structure known as an R-loop, consisting of a DNA–RNA hybrid and a displaced DNA strand. R-loops have been reported to occur over certain transcription termination sites, and to be associated with pausing of RNA polymerase. Nicholas Proudfoot and colleagues show that these R-loops are needed for antisense transcription that, via an RNA interference process, results in deposition of a repressive H3K9me2 modification and recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1γ. This use of R-loops to modify chromatin state reinforces pausing and thereby enhances termination. The formation of R-loops is a natural consequence of the transcription process, caused by invasion of the DNA duplex by nascent transcripts. These structures have been considered rare transcriptional by-products with potentially harmful effects on genome integrity owing to the fragility of the displaced DNA coding strand1. However, R-loops may also possess beneficial effects, as their widespread formation has been detected over CpG island promoters in human genes2,3. Furthermore, we have previously shown that R-loops are particularly enriched over G-rich terminator elements. These facilitate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing before efficient termination4. Here we reveal an unanticipated link between R-loops and RNA-interference-dependent H3K9me2 formation over pause-site termination regions in mammalian protein-coding genes. We show that R-loops induce antisense transcription over these pause elements, which in turn leads to the generation of double-stranded RNA and the recruitment of DICER, AGO1, AGO2 and the G9a histone lysine methyltransferase. Consequently, an H3K9me2 repressive mark is formed and heterochromatin protein 1γ (HP1γ) is recruited, which reinforces Pol II pausing before efficient transcriptional termination. We predict that R-loops promote a chromatin architecture that defines the termination region for a substantial subset of mammalian genes."

https://openalex.org/W2029980283,"Ultrafast endocytosis can retrieve a single, large endocytic vesicle as fast as 50–100 ms after synaptic vesicle fusion. However, the fate of the large endocytic vesicles is not known. Here we demonstrate that these vesicles transition to a synaptic endosome about one second after stimulation. The endosome is resolved into coated vesicles after 3 s, which in turn become small-diameter synaptic vesicles 5–6 s after stimulation. We disrupted clathrin function using RNA interference (RNAi) and found that clathrin is not required for ultrafast endocytosis but is required to generate synaptic vesicles from the endosome. Ultrafast endocytosis fails when actin polymerization is disrupted, or when neurons are stimulated at room temperature instead of physiological temperature. In the absence of ultrafast endocytosis, synaptic vesicles are retrieved directly from the plasma membrane by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These results may explain discrepancies among published experiments concerning the role of clathrin in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Ultrastructural analysis of synaptic vesicle recycling reveals that clathrin is not required for the initial rapid step of vesicle recycling by ultrafast endocytosis at the plasma membrane and instead clathrin acts later at an endosome to regenerate synaptic vesicles; however, when ultrafast endocytosis does not occur (for example, in experiments at room temperature rather than physiological temperature), clathrin-mediated endocytosis does happen at the plasma membrane. Since the discovery of synaptic vesicle recycling in the 1970s, clathrin has been thought to act at the plasma membrane to reconstitute synaptic vesicles about 20 seconds after stimulation of the axon terminal. Erik Jorgensen and colleagues have revisited these original experiments, but combining optogenetic stimulation with high-pressure freezing to rapidly fix the samples after stimulation. This changes the picture: the previously hypothesized mechanism operates at a non-physiological, 'room temperature' of 22°C, when ultra-fast endocytosis is disrupted. At a physiological temperature (34°C), large vesicles are instead retrieved from the plasma membrane within about 50 milliseconds, through clathrin-independent, ultra-fast endocytosis; these then fuse to form endosomes from which small synaptic vesicles are regenerated by clathrin scaffolds, about 5 seconds after stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2016372378,"Ground-based and satellite observations show that the black hole in the ultraluminous X-ray source P13 has a mass of less than 15 times that of the Sun and displays the properties that typically distinguish ultraluminous X-ray sources from other stellar-mass black holes. Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are non-nuclear point sources that are widely believed to contain either intermediate mass black holes or smaller, stellar mass black holes accreting from a binary companion.

Matteo Bachetti et al. observe a source in the galaxy M82 that, the pulsation data imply, harbours a neutron star rather than a black hole, raising doubts over the assumption that black holes power the most luminous X-ray binaries. Most ultraluminous X-ray sources1 have a typical set of properties not seen in Galactic stellar-mass black holes. They have luminosities of more than 3 × 1039 ergs per second, unusually soft X-ray components (with a typical temperature of less than about 0.3 kiloelectronvolts) and a characteristic downturn2,3 in their spectra above about 5 kiloelectronvolts. Such puzzling properties have been interpreted either as evidence of intermediate-mass black holes4,5 or as emission from stellar-mass black holes accreting above their Eddington limit6,7, analogous to some Galactic black holes at peak luminosity8,9. Recently, a very soft X-ray spectrum was observed in a rare and transient stellar-mass black hole10. Here we report that the X-ray source P13 in the galaxy NGC 779311 is in a binary system with a period of about 64 days and exhibits all three canonical properties of ultraluminous sources. By modelling the strong optical and ultraviolet modulations arising from X-ray heating of the B9Ia donor star, we constrain the black hole mass to be less than 15 solar masses. Our results demonstrate that in P13, soft thermal emission and spectral curvature are indeed signatures of supercritical accretion. By analogy, ultraluminous X-ray sources with similar X-ray spectra and luminosities of up to a few times 1040 ergs per second can be explained by supercritical accretion onto massive stellar-mass black holes."
https://openalex.org/W2041331748,"Objectives The UK government has noted the public health importance of food prices and the affordability of a healthy diet. Yet, methods for tracking change over time have not been established. We aimed to investigate the prices of more and less healthy foods over time using existing government data on national food prices and nutrition content. Methods We linked economic data for 94 foods and beverages in the UK Consumer Price Index to food and nutrient data from the UK Department of Health's National Diet and Nutrition Survey, producing a novel dataset across the period 2002–2012. Each item was assigned to a food group and also categorised as either “more healthy” or “less healthy” using a nutrient profiling model developed by the Food Standards Agency. We tested statistical significance using a t-test and repeated measures ANOVA. Results The mean (standard deviation) 2012 price/1000 kcal was £2.50 (0.29) for less healthy items and £7.49 (1.27) for more healthy items. The ANOVA results confirmed that all prices had risen over the period 2002–2012, but more healthy items rose faster than less healthy ones in absolute terms:£0.17 compared to £0.07/1000 kcal per year on average for more and less healthy items, respectively (p<0.001). Conclusions Since 2002, more healthy foods and beverages have been consistently more expensive than less healthy ones, with a growing gap between them. This trend is likely to make healthier diets less affordable over time, which may have implications for individual food security and population health, and it may exacerbate social inequalities in health. The novel data linkage employed here could be used as the basis for routine food price monitoring to inform public health policy."
https://openalex.org/W2014214300,"Toll-like receptor (TLR)4-mediated signaling has been implicated in tumor cell invasion, survival, and metastasis in a variety of cancers. This study investigated the expression and biological role of TLR4 in human breast cancer metastasis. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 are human breast cancer cell lines with low and high metastatic potential, respectively. Using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to stimulate MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, expression of TLR4 mRNA and protein increased compared with that in control cells. TLR4 activation notably up-regulated expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) mRNA and their secretion in the supernatants of both cell lines. LPS enhanced invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells by transwell assay and MCF-7 cells by wound healing assay. LPS triggered increased expression of TLR4 downstream signaling pathway protein myeloid differentiation factor 88(MyD88) and resulted in interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 higher production by human breast cancer cells. Stimulation of TLR4 with LPS promoted tumorigenesis and formed metastatic lesions in liver of nude mice. Moreover, expression of TLR4 and MyD88 as well as invasiveness and migration of the cells could be blocked by TLR4 antagonist. Combined with clinicopathological parameters, TLR4 was overexpressed in human breast cancer tissue and correlated with lymph node metastasis. These findings indicated that TLR4 may participate in the progression and metastasis of human breast cancer and provide a new therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W1973660349,"Prenatal di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) exposure can produce reproductive toxicity in animal models. Only limited data exist from human studies on maternal DEHP exposure and its effects on infants. We aimed to examine the associations between DEHP exposure in utero and reproductive hormone levels in cord blood. Between 2002 and 2005, 514 pregnant women agreed to participate in the Hokkaido Study Sapporo Cohort. Maternal blood samples were taken from 23-35 weeks of gestation and the concentration of the primary metabolite of DEHP, mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), was measured. Concentrations of infant reproductive hormones including estradiol (E2), total testosterone (T), and progesterone (P4), inhibin B, insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3), steroid hormone binding globulin, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone were measured from cord blood. Two hundred and two samples with both MEHP and hormones' data were included in statistical analysis. The participants completed a self-administered questionnaire regarding information on maternal characteristics. Gestational age, birth weight and infant sex were obtained from birth records. In an adjusted linear regression analysis fit to all study participants, maternal MEHP levels were found to be associated with reduced levels of T/E2, P4, and inhibin B. For the stratified analyses for sex, inverse associations between maternal MEHP levels T/E2, P4, inhibin B, and INSL3 were statistically significant for males only. In addition, the MEHP quartile model showed a significant p-value trend for P4, inhibin B, and INSL3 decrease in males. Since inhibin B and INSL3 are major secretory products of Sertoli and Leydig cell, respectively, the results of this study suggest that DEHP exposure in utero may have adverse effects on both Sertoli and Leydig cell development in males, which agrees with the results obtained from animal studies. Comprehensive studies investigating phthalates' exposure in humans, as well as their long-term effects on reproductive development are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2050233904,"Integrating cover crops (CC) in rotations provides multiple ecological services, but it must be ensured that management does not increase pre-emptive competition with the subsequent crop. This experiment was conducted to study the effect of kill date on: (i) CC growth and N content; (ii) the chemical composition of residues; (iii) soil inorganic N and potentially mineralizable N; and (iv) soil water content. Treatments were fallow and a CC mixture of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and vetch (Vicia sativa L.) sown in October and killed on two different dates in spring. Above-ground biomass and chemical composition of CC were determined at harvest, and ground cover was monitored based on digital image analysis. Soil mineral N was determined before sowing and after killing the CC, and potentially mineralizable N was measured by aerobic incubation at the end of the experiment. Soil water content was monitored daily to a depth of 1.1 m using capacitance sensors. Under the present conditions of high N availability, delaying kill date increased barley above-ground biomass and N uptake from deep soil layers; little differences were observed in vetch. Postponing kill date increased the C/N ratio and the fiber content of plant residues. Ground cover reached >80% by the first kill date (∼1250°C days). Kill date was a means to control soil inorganic N by balancing the N retained in the residue and soil, and showed promise for mitigating N losses. The early kill date decreased the risk of water and N pre-emptive competition by reducing soil depletion, preserving rain harvested between kill dates and allowing more time for N release in spring. The soil potentially mineralizable N was enhanced by the CC and kill date delay. Therefore kill date is a crucial management variable for maximizing the CC benefits in agricultural systems."
https://openalex.org/W1996005175,"Classical novae are the most common astrophysical thermonuclear explosions, occurring on the surfaces of white dwarf stars accreting gas from companions in binary star systems. Novae typically expel ~10^(-4) solar masses of material at velocities exceeding 1,000 kilometres per second. However, the mechanism of mass ejection in novae is poorly understood, and could be dominated by the impulsive flash of thermonuclear energy, prolonged optically thick winds, or binary interaction with the nova envelope. Classical novae are now routinely detected in gigaelectronvolt gamma-ray wavelengths, suggesting that relativistic particles are accelerated by strong shocks in the ejecta. Here we report high-resolution radio imaging of the gamma-ray-emitting nova V959 Mon. We find that its ejecta were shaped by the motion of the binary system: some gas was expelled rapidly along the poles as a wind from the white dwarf, while denser material drifted out along the equatorial plane, propelled by orbital motion. At the interface between the equatorial and polar regions, we observe synchrotron emission indicative of shocks and relativistic particle acceleration, thereby pinpointing the location of gamma-ray production. Binary shaping of the nova ejecta and associated internal shocks are expected to be widespread among novae, explaining why many novae are gamma-ray emitters."
https://openalex.org/W2024220519,"Intestinal parasite infections are major public health problems of children in developing countries causing undernutrition, anemia, intestinal obstruction and mental and physical growth retardation. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of intestinal helminthic infections among children under five years of age with emphasis on Schistosoma mansoni in Wonji Shoa Sugar Estate, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional parasitological survey was conducted in under-five children living in Wonji Shoa Sugar Estate Ethiopia, April, 2013. Stool samples were collected and examined for intestinal parasites using single Kato-Katz and single Sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin (SAF) solution concentration methods. Out of 374 children examined using single Kato-Katz and single SAF-concentration methods, 24.3% were infected with at least one intestinal parasite species. About 10.4%, 8.8%, 4.6%, 2.9%, 1.6% and 0.8% of the children were infected with Hymenolepis nana, Schistosoma mansoni, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Enterobius vermicularis and hookworm, respectively. Prevalence of double, triple and quadruple intestinal helminthic infection was 6.4%, 0.54% and 1.1%, respectively. A significant increase in prevalence of S. mansoni (8.3% versus 3.2%) and T. trichiura (2.7% versus 0.5%) infection was observed when determined via the single Kato-Katz method compared to the prevalence of the parasites determined via the single SAF-concentration method. On the other hand, the single SAF-concentration method (9.1%) revealed a significantly higher prevalence of H. nana infection than the single Kato-Katz (1.6%) does. In conclusion, intestinal helminths infections particularly S. mansoni and H. nana were prevalent in under-five children of Wonji Shoa Sugar Estate. Including praziquantel treatment in the deworming program as per the World Health Organization guidelines would be vital to reduce the burden of these diseases in areas where S. mansoni and H. nana infections are prevalent among under-fives. Kato-Katz can be used in estimating the prevalence of S. mansoni and other helminth infections."
https://openalex.org/W2086376385,"Mouse lemurs are suggested to represent promising novel non-human primate models for aging research. However, standardized and cross-taxa cognitive testing methods are still lacking. Touchscreen-based testing procedures have proven high stimulus control and reliability in humans and rodents. The aim of this study was to adapt these procedures to mouse lemurs, thereby exploring the effect of age. We measured appetitive learning and cognitive flexibility of two age groups by applying pairwise visual discrimination (PD) and reversal learning (PDR) tasks. On average, mouse lemurs needed 24 days of training before starting with the PD task. Individual performances in PD and PDR tasks correlate significantly, suggesting that individual learning performance is unrelated to the respective task. Compared to the young, aged mouse lemurs showed impairments in both PD and PDR tasks. They needed significantly more trials to reach the task criteria. A much higher inter-individual variation in old than in young adults was revealed. Furthermore, in the PDR task, we found a significantly higher perseverance in aged compared to young adults, indicating an age-related deficit in cognitive flexibility. This study presents the first touchscreen-based data on the cognitive skills and age-related dysfunction in mouse lemurs and provides a unique basis to study mechanisms of inter-individual variation. It furthermore opens exciting perspectives for comparative approaches in aging, personality, and evolutionary research."
https://openalex.org/W1994331961,"The fragile X mental retardation 1 mutant mouse (Fmr1 KO) recapitulates several of the neurologic deficits associated with Fragile X syndrome (FXS). As tactile hypersensitivity is a hallmark of FXS, we examined the sensory representation of individual whiskers in somatosensory barrel cortex of Fmr1 KO and wild-type (WT) mice and compared their performance in a whisker-dependent learning paradigm, the gap cross assay. Fmr1 KO mice exhibited elevated responses to stimulation of individual whiskers as measured by optical imaging of intrinsic signals. In the gap cross task, initial performance of Fmr1 KO mice was indistinguishable from WT controls. However, while WT mice improved significantly with experience at all gap distances, Fmr1 KO mice displayed significant and specific deficits in improvement at longer distances which rely solely on tactile information from whiskers. Thus, Fmr1 KO mice possess altered cortical responses to sensory input that correlates with a deficit in tactile learning."
https://openalex.org/W2035866925,"Modern and Cenozoic deep-sea hydrothermal-vent and methane-seep communities are dominated by large tubeworms, bivalves and gastropods. In contrast, many Early Cretaceous seep communities were dominated by the largest Mesozoic rhynchonellid brachiopod, the dimerelloid Peregrinella, the paleoecologic and evolutionary traits of which are still poorly understood. We investigated the nature of Peregrinella based on 11 occurrences world wide and a literature survey. All in situ occurrences of Peregrinella were confirmed as methane-seep deposits, supporting the view that Peregrinella lived exclusively at methane seeps. Strontium isotope stratigraphy indicates that Peregrinella originated in the late Berriasian and disappeared after the early Hauterivian, giving it a geologic range of ca. 9.0 (+1.45/-0.85) million years. This range is similar to that of rhynchonellid brachiopod genera in general, and in this respect Peregrinella differs from seep-inhabiting mollusks, which have, on average, longer geologic ranges than marine mollusks in general. Furthermore, we found that (1) Peregrinella grew to larger sizes at passive continental margins than at active margins; (2) it grew to larger sizes at sites with diffusive seepage than at sites with advective fluid flow; (3) despite its commonly huge numerical abundance, its presence had no discernible impact on the diversity of other taxa at seep sites, including infaunal chemosymbiotic bivalves; and (4) neither its appearance nor its extinction coincides with those of other seep-restricted taxa or with global extinction events during the late Mesozoic. A preference of Peregrinella for diffusive seepage is inferred from the larger average sizes of Peregrinella at sites with more microcrystalline carbonate (micrite) and less seep cements. Because other seep-inhabiting brachiopods occur at sites where such cements are very abundant, we speculate that the various vent- and seep-inhabiting dimerelloid brachiopods since Devonian time may have adapted to these environments in more than one way."
https://openalex.org/W2056817780,"To regenerate damaged axons, neurons must express a cassette of regeneration-associated genes (RAGs) that increases intrinsic growth capacity and confers resistance to extrinsic inhibitory cues. Here we show that dibutyrl-cAMP or forskolin combined with constitutive-active CREB are superior to either agent alone in driving neurite growth on permissive and inhibitory substrates. Of the RAGs examined, only arginase 1 (Arg1) expression correlated with the increased neurite growth induced by the cAMP/CREB combination, both of which were AP1-dependent. This suggests that cAMP-induced AP1 activity is necessary and interacts with CREB to drive expression of RAGs relevant for regeneration and demonstrates that combining a small molecule (cAMP) with an activated transcription factor (CREB) stimulates the gene expression necessary to enhance axonal regeneration."

We have discovered that in WM1158, a highly aggressive melanoma cell line, down-regulation of ACTN4 by shRNA induces a collagen I-dependent amoeboidal-to-mesenchymal transition. Re-expression of low levels of WT ACTN4 but not similar expression levels of ACTN1 successfully restores the amoeboidal morphology and limits collagen I gel compaction.

Surprisingly, ACTN4 KD cells migrate faster than the ones expressing the scrambled shRNA on a collagen I gel (two-dimensional) although these two cell lines migrate similarly on tissue culture. Most importantly, down-regulation of ACTN4 significantly reduced invasion of WM1158 cells into the three-dimensional collagen I gel, a representative of the dermis.

Melanoma, a potentially deadly skin cancer, originates in the pigment-producing melanocytes of the basal layer of the epidermis. Patients with melanoma can be cured by surgical resection if they are diagnosed at a very early stage when the transformed melanocytes migrate radially. However, the rate of 5-year survival of melanoma patients dramatically declines once the tumor cells invade vertically through the dermal matrix, and then metastasize to distant organs. These disseminated tumors respond poorly if at all to current chemotherapies (1Arozarena I. Sanchez-Laorden B. Packer L. Hidalgo-Carcedo C. Hayward R. Viros A. Sahai E. Marais R.

The change to an amoeboidal morphology by invading carcinomas is associated with activation of the small GTPase Rho (6Friedl P. Alexander S.

Ho et al. also have found that knockdown of RhoJ inhibits melanoma invasion through a change in actin cytoskeletal dynamics (7Ho H. Aruri J. Kapadia R. Mehr H. White M.A. Ganesan A.K.

These findings argue for alterations of the cytoskeleton and linkage to the membrane as operative in melanoma invasion. Recent studies revealed that α-actinin-4 (ACTN4) 2The abbreviations used are: ACTN4α-actinin-4TIRFtotal internal reflection fluorescenceTIR-FMtotal internal reflection fluorescence microscopyKDknockdownRSFradial stress fiberTAtransverse arcs. is up-regulated in both biopsies and in cultured artificial skin suggesting that ACTN4 may play roles in the metastasis of melanoma cells (8Hood B.L.

Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 3656-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). ACTN4, a member of a family of actin crosslinking proteins, has been implicated in cancer metastasis and is considered as a biomarker of cancer diagnosis (9Yamamoto S. Tsuda H. Honda K. Onozato K.

Increased expression of ACTN4 has been reported in melanoma cell lines WM983a and WM1158, compared with normal melanocytes in which only trace amounts are detected (8Hood B.L. Grahovac J. Flint M.S. Sun M. Charro N. Becker D. Wells A. Conrads T.P. Proteomic analysis of laser microdissected melanoma cells from skin organ cultures.J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 3656-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In fact, ACTN4 is one of the most up-regulated proteins in the dermis when comparing melanoma-invaded with non-involved regions of skin. Of interest, when melanoma cells are activated by low dose proton beam irradiation, ACTN4 expression is increased (10Kedracka-Krok S. Jankowska U. Elas M. Sowa U. Swakon J. Cierniak A. Olko P. Romanowska-Dixon B. Urbanska K. Proteomic analysis of proton beam irradiated human melanoma cells.PloS one. 2014; 9: e84621Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These findings implicate ACTN4 as being involved in the invasion and metastasis of melanoma. However, the precise biological function of ACTN4 in melanoma cells remains elusive. ACTN4 is comprised of three dominant domains: N-terminal actin binding domain, central spectrin repeats, and C-terminal calcium binding motifs. These domains drive its biochemical functions of cross-linking actin filaments, bridging the cytoskeleton to cell membrane and regulating transcription. This suggests a critical role of ACTN4 in transcellular contractility and cell shape (11Shao H. Wang J.H. Pollak M.R.

Melanocytes were cultured in DermaLife M medium supplemented with growth factors and other chemical components (Lifeline Cell Technology, Frederick, MD). Melanoma cell line WM35, a gift from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ), was cultured in MCDB 153:L15 medium mixture at a ratio of 4:1 in volume with addition of 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg ml−1 insulin, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1× pen/strip antibiotics. Melanoma cell line IgR3 was cultured in RPMI medium with addition of 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× pen/strip antibiotics. Melanoma cell lines WM983a, WM983b, and WM1158 were cultured in DMEM (1 g liter−1 glucose):L15 medium mixture at a ratio of 3:1 in volume with addition of 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× pen/strip antibiotics. Collagen I was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Small hairpin RNAs were synthesized at Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Lipofectamine 2000 was purchased from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY). Polyclonal actin antibody was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. ACTN1 and ACTN4 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (Dallas, TX). Sense and antisense oligonucleotides of human ACTN4 shRNA were denatured, annealed and then cloned into vector pSilencer 2.0-U6 (Life Technology) (Ambion, Grand Island, NY). Scrambled shRNA vector was purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). Both scrambled (WM1158) and ACTN4 (ACTN4 KD) shRNAs were transfected into melanoma cells using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's manual. Stable colonies were selected and cultured in complete growth medium in the presence of 1.5 μg/ml puromycin. To construct a shRNA-resistant ACTN4, DNA mutagenesis was performed by PCR. PCR fragments were then cloned into expression vector pEGFP-N1. Positive colony was further confirmed by DNA sequencing. Melanoma cells were cultured in 6-well tissue culture plates until they were confluent. Cells were washed briefly with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in the absence of calcium and magnesium and then lysed in RIPA buffer in the presence of 1× protease inhibitors cocktails set V (Billerica, MA). The lysate was left on ice for 5 min prior to brief sonicating. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was transferred to a new microcentrifugation tube. The concentration of total protein was determined using Thermo Scientific™ Pierce™ BCA™ Protein Assay (Rockland, IL). 10 μg of total proteins mixed with 5x SDS sample buffer in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol was boiled for 3 min prior to loading on SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and immunoblotted with appropriate primary antibodies according to standard immunoblotting protocol. Cells grown on coverslips were rinsed briefly with PBS and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, followed by permeablizing with 0.2% Triton X-100 on ice for 5 min. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with various primary antibodies diluted in 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature and then washed three times with PBS (10 min each wash). Subsequently, fluorescent secondary antibody diluted in 1% BSA was added and incubated with cells for 45 min at room temperature followed with three washes of PBS. For staining of actin filaments, rhodamine phalloidin diluted in 1% BSA was added and incubated with permeabilized cells for 15 min at room temperature. After complete washing, coverslips were then transferred inversely to a glass slide carrying a drop of Mowiol 4-88 (Sigma) and stored in the refrigerator overnight. Images were taken with Olympus microscopy at the Center for Biological Imaging, University of Pittsburgh. Cells transiently express vinculin-eGFP were imaged using the objective-type total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIR-FM) as described previously (14Keyel P.A. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M.

A CFI Apochromat series 1.49 NA TIR-FM objective was mounted on a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope equipped with a Perfect Focus System device, Agilent 4 color launch and Elements AR software. Images were collected using an Andor Zyla 5.5 camera, while all colors were collected with a single quad pass (405, 488, 561, 633 nm) cube to ensure images were sorted with a high speed (20 ms) FLI (Fingerlakes) filter wheel. Exposure times were 100 ms, and images were collected every 2 min. Cellular compaction of melanoma cells was assessed using a previously described method (15Iwabu A. Smith K. Allen F.D.

In brief, parental and ACTN4 KD cells were harvested from monolayer culture using 0.25% trypsin/EDTA treatment and resuspended in growth medium. Neutralized collagen I solution (1 mg/ml) containing 106 cells/ml cells was dispensed into 24-well tissue culture plates (0.5 ml/well). Collagen solutions were left to polymerize for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 followed by overlaying 1 ml of growth medium per well on the matrix. The matrices were then gently released from the edge of each gel using a long and thin forceps and further incubated for 24 h. Compaction was determined by measuring the area of the top surface of collagen I gel using PhotoShop software. Cell migration was performed according to a motility assay described previously (16Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. Epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated cell motility: phospholipase C activity is required, but mitogen-activated protein kinase activity is not sufficient for induced cell movement.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated on 6-well tissue culture plate and grown to confluence in complete growth medium. Then, cells were scraped using a rubber policeman to create a wound area. A further culture for 24 h was performed to allow cells to migrate into this denuded area. Photographs were taken at 0 and 24 h, respectively. The relative distance migrated by the cells was analyzed using Photoshop software. Neutralized collagen I solution (2.5 mg/ml) was dispensed into 12-well tissue culture plates (0.5 ml/well) and left to polymerize for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. To create a wound area, a sterile 1.5 × 8 mm coverslip was gently laid on the center of the surface of the polymerized collagen I matrix. Cells were then seeded (5 × 105 cells/well) and left to attach for 2h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The coverslip was then carefully removed using an extra fine forceps without disturbing the matrix surface and cells. Unattached cells were completely washed away with growth medium. Cells migrating into the acellular area were imaged under Nikon live microscopy, and migration speed was calculated using Metamorph software. Cells were seeded in 12-well tissue culture plate (5 × 105 cells/well) coated with collagen I until most of cells attached and partially spread. Unattached cells were completely washed away by PBS followed by addition of 1 ml of 2.5 mg/ml neutralized collagen I solution containing 1× EMEM medium. Collagen solutions were left to polymerize for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 followed by overlaying 2 ml of complete growth medium per well onto the matrix for further culture. After 3 days, the collagen I matrix was fixed with 4% formaldehyde diluted in PBS for 30 min at room temperature followed by three washes with PBS. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 on ice for 10 min prior to staining with 1 μg/ml DAPI for 16 h at 4 °C. After throughout washing, cells invaded into the collagen I matrix to a distance of 100 μm above the bottom of the matrix gel were imaged under confocal microscopy and then counted. To access statistical significance, we used Student's t test for pair-wise comparisons and one-way ANOVA with Tukey post test (for multiple comparisons) using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Graphs show mean ± S.E. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01. ACTN4 has been suggested to be a biomarker in the diagnosis of human cancer (17Honda K. Yamada T. Endo R. Ino Y. Gotoh M. Tsuda H. Yamada Y.

Cell Res. 2010; 316: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether this molecule drives invasion of melanomas. Expanding on earlier work, we find that ACTN4 levels are higher in melanoma cells compared with melanocytes, though absolute levels vary between cell lines (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, ACTN1, which bundles parallel actin filaments and is ubiquitous in non-muscle cells (21Grazi E. Trombetta G. Magri E. Cuneo P. Schwienbacher C. α-Actinin from Chicken Gizzard - at Low-Temperature, the Onset of Actin-Gelling Activity Correlates with Actin Bundling.Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), is similar among all detected cell lines. Examining the role of ACTN4 in melanoma migration, we find that levels do not directly correlate with the rate of closure of an in vitro wound healing (cell scrape) assay performed in two dimensions on tissue culture plastic plates (Fig. 1B). We earlier reported that knock-out of ACTN4 significantly inhibits the rate of migration in fibroblasts (11Shao H. Wang J.H. Pollak M.R. Wells A. α-actinin-4 is essential for maintaining the spreading, motility and contractility of fibroblasts.PloS one. 2010; 5: e13921Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Herein we queried whether this was similar in melanoma cell invasiveness by assessing this in the fastest melanoma line, WM1158. We stably transfected WM1158 with specific ACTN4 shRNA to accomplish >90% decrease in ACTN4 protein expression when compared with scrambled shRNA-transfected cells, whereas the protein expression of ACTN1 is not affected by ACTN4 shRNA (Fig. 2A), suggesting ACTN4 is specifically down-regulated by shRNA. We had earlier found that melanoma migration in two dimensions is distinct from that during migration through three-dimensional matrices, such as the skin dermis, similar to other tumors (22Friedl P. Wolf K. Lammerding J. Nuclear mechanics during cell migration.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2011; 23 (253): 253Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 23Zaman M.H. Trapani L.M. Sieminski A. MacKellar D.

Invasive melanomas switch between a mesenchymal and an amoeboidal morphology to penetrate such collagen I-rich matrices (4Grahovac J. Wells A. Matrikine and matricellular regulators of EGF receptor signaling on cancer cell migration and invasion.Laboratory Investig. 2014; 94: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As ACTN4 has been suggested to link the cytoskeleton to cell membrane (11Shao H. Wang J.H. Pollak M.R.

Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we determined whether this morphologic change is affected by varying ACTN4 levels. Both wild type (scrambled shRNA) and ACTN4 knockdown (KD) cells were rounded when plated on tissue culture plastic, but upon plating on the top of a collagen I gel, only the ACTN4 KD cells assumed an elongated mesenchymal shape (Fig. 2, B and C). Interestingly, both radial stress fiber (RSF) and transverse arcs (TA) are noted in WM1158 cells while only TAs are visible in ACTN4 KD cells (Fig. 2D), suggesting the ACTN4 is required for RSF assembly. This finding is consistent with previous studies in which ACTN1 is required for the assembly of RSF in human osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells (27Oakes P.W. Beckham Y. Stricker J. Gardel M.L. Tension is required but not sufficient for focal adhesion maturation without a stress fiber template.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 196: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 28Feng Y. Ngu H.

Cell Res. 2013; 319: 1124-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that this morphologic switch in WM1158 is due to a down-regulation of unknown protein by ACTN4 shRNA, we re-expressed full-length C-terminal eGFP-tagged ACTN4 in which 6 nucleotides (wobble bases) within its shRNA region are replaced with shRNA-resistant nucleotides (Fig. 2E). (All ACTN4-eGFP and ACTN4-eGFP-(1–890) expressed in ACTN4 KD cells refer to ACTN4 shRNA resistant). Re-expression of ACTN4 in ACTN4 KD cells restored the amoeboidal morphology (Fig. 2F), which suggests that the mesenchymal morphology of ACTN4 KD cells is specifically caused by the loss of ACTN4. As ACTN4 and ACTN1, two non-muscle isoforms of α-actinin protein family are highly homologous and exhibit similar actin binding activity, we queried whether expression of ACTN1 could also rescue the morphology of ACTN4 KD WM1158 cells. This was tested even though the two non-muscle isoforms have been shown to present distinct function and localization in different cells (29Sen S. Dong M. Kumar S. Isoform-specific contributions of α-actinin to glioma cell mechanobiology.PloS one. 2009; 4: e8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30Hamill K.J. Hopkinson S.B. Skalli O. Jones J.C. Actinin-4 in keratinocytes regulates motility via an effect on lamellipodia stability and matrix adhesions.FASEB J. 2013; 27: 546-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, the expression levels of exogenous ACTN1 and ACTN4 in ACTN4 KD WM1158 varied between cells though on average they were similar (Fig. 3A as determined by immunoblotting). Therefore, we quantified the ratio of length to width of all imaged cells in terms of the amount of either ACTN4 or ACTN1 expressed. Any detectable levels of ACTN4 rescued the amoeboidal morphology (Fig. 3, C, D, and E). Only higher levels of ACTN1 could revert the ACTN4 KD WM1158 cells back toward the amoeboidal morphology, whereas lower levels (ACTN1-eGFP(L)) remained mesenchymal (Fig. 3, B, D, and E). Surprisingly, we found that WM1158 cells do not express equal levels of ACTN1 and ACTN4. As shown in Fig. 3F, WM1158 cells express about twice the ACTN1 as ACTN4 determined at both protein and mRNA levels. That lower, physiological levels of ACTN4 but not low levels of ACTN1 restored the ACTN4 KD WM1158 morphology suggests that ACTN4 is the preferential effector in maintaining cell morphology of melanoma cells. To ensure that these changes are not unique to the WM1158 line, a distinct invasive melanoma line, IgR3, was manipulated and found to similarly present a polarized mesenchymal morphology in the absence of ACTN4 (Fig. 4, A and B). Consistent with this dependence on collagen-dependent morphology, the morphologic switch in ACTN4 KD WM1158 cells was blocked by antibodies to integrin-β1 (Fig. 5). These findings show that melanoma cell morphology in the presence of collagen fibrils is dependent on ACTN4.FIGURE 5Integrin β1 antibody blocks mesenchymal morphology of WM1158 ACTN4 KD cells.

To determine whether mesenchymal ACTN4 KD WM1158 cells have increased cell contractility, we performed a collagen I gel compaction assay. As shown in Fig. 6, ACTN4 knockdown significantly increases cell compaction of WM1158 cells compared with scrambled shRNA-expressing cells. Re-expression of ACTN4-eGFP in ACTN4 KD cells limits the gel compaction to control levels. In line with the effect of exogenous ACTN1 on the rescue of morphology of ACTN4 KD WM1158 cells (Fig. 3E), ACTN1-eGFP(L) expressing KD cells fail to restore the gel compaction although KD cells in which both high and low level of"

Previously, K5 has been found to display an inhibitory effect on alkali burn-induced corneal neovascularization and ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization (5Cai W. Ma J. Li C. Yang Z. Yang X.

Moreover, studies have shown K5 to act as an effective intervention against the growth of various solid tumors, such as glioma, colorectal, and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as Lewis lung carcinoma via its anti-angiogenic activity (7Perri S.R.

The inhibitory effect of K5 on neovascularization is based on the targeting of endothelial cells (ECs). It has been reported that K5 may cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of bFGF-stimulated endothelial cells (11Lu H. Dhanabal M. Volk R. Waterman M.J. Ramchandran R. Knebelmann B. Segal M.

The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), also known as multifunctional mitochondrial porin, has three isoforms located on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Among them, VDAC1 is the most studied isoform and regulates a series of physiological and pathological events, such as the balance of cellular Ca2+, energy metabolism, and cell apoptosis (12Shoshan-Barmatz V. Ben-Hail D. VDAC, a multi-functional mitochondrial protein as a pharmacological target.Mitochondrion. 2012; 12: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of VDAC1 has been shown to facilitate arsenic trioxide (As2O3)-induced human IM-9 multiple myeloma cell death (13Zheng Y. Shi Y. Tian C. Jiang C. Jin H. Chen J. Almasan A. Tang H. Chen Q. Essential role of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening and cytochrome c release induced by arsenic trioxide.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1239-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of VDAC1 by siRNA attenuated endostatin-induced human microvascular endothelial cell apoptosis (14Yuan S. Fu Y. Wang X. Shi H. Huang Y. Song X. Li L. Song N. Luo Y. Voltage-dependent anion channel 1 is involved in endostatin-induced endothelial cell apoptosis.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 2809-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). VDAC1-mediated apoptosis mainly occurs through interaction with pro-apoptotic protein Bax and causes the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which results in the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm and subsequent cleavage of caspase-9 (15Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Bcl-2 family proteins regulate the release of apoptogenic cytochrome c by the mitochondrial channel VDAC.Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). Thus, VDAC1 presents as a key factor in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Our previous investigation showed that the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway at least partly mediated K5-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) apoptosis by regulating the subcellular distribution of Bak and Bcl-xL (16Gu X. Yao Y. Cheng R. Zhang Y. Dai Z. Wan G. Yang Z. Cai W. Gao G. Yang X. Plasminogen K5 activates mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in endothelial cells by regulating Bak and Bcl-x(L) subcellular distribution.Apoptosis. 2011; 16: 846-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that VDAC1 may link the upstream signals to the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in endothelial cells initiated by K5. VDAC was originally considered to be located only on mitochondrial membrane. Later, increasing evidence suggested that VDAC may also be found on the plasma membrane (17De Pinto V. Messina A. Accardi R. Aiello R. Guarino F. Tomasello M.F. Tommasino M. Tasco G. Casadio R. Benz R. De Giorgi F. Ichas F. Baker M. Lawen A. New functions of an old protein: the eukaryotic porin or voltage dependent anion selective channel (VDAC).Ital. J. Biochem. 2003; 52: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the plasma membrane VDAC1 was reported to be the receptor of K5 in HUVECs (18Gonzalez-Gronow M. Kalfa T. Johnson C.E. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. The voltage-dependent anion channel is a receptor for plasminogen kringle 5 on human endothelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27312-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the exact role and underlying mechanisms of VDAC1 in K5-induced EC apoptosis remain elusive. Here, we show for the first time that K5 induces VDAC1 expression both in plasma membrane and mitochondrial membrane through inhibiting its ubiquitin-dependent degradation via the AKT-GSK3β axis. The increased plasma membrane VDAC1, as a receptor, delivers the signal to modulate its own expression, and the increased mitochondrial membrane VDAC1 initiates the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway through binding with Bak. There is a positive feedback loop of “VDAC1-AKT-GSK3β-VDAC1” in K5-induced EC apoptosis. Our findings may provide new perspectives on the mechanisms of K5-induced apoptosis. This study conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Sun Yat-sen University. Written informed consent was obtained from the donor. HUVECs were isolated from human umbilical cord with trypsin, as previously described (19Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. Culture of human endothelial cells derived from umbilical veins: identification by morphologic and immunologic criteria.J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6008) Google Scholar). After dissociation, the cells were collected and cultured on gelatin-coated culture flasks in M199 medium with 15% FBS, 60 μg/ml of endothelial cell growth supplements, 100 μg/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. All cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Subcultures were performed with trypsin-EDTA. Medium were refreshed every 2 days. The cultured cells were serum-starved overnight and then carried out under 1% FBS and 20 ng/ml of bFGF for the indicated time periods. Studies were conducted on cells from passages 2–6. MG132 and AKT inhibitor IV were obtained from Merck Millipore (La Jolla, CA). The GSK3β inhibitor (CHIR99021) was purchased from Selleckchem (Sellekchem, TX). Insulin was obtained from Sigma. Hexokinase I (HKI) protein was from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Antibodies of streptavidin-HRP, Na+/K+-ATPase, p-AKT (Ser-473), AKT, p-GSK3β (Ser-9), His tag, Myc tag, cytochrome c, and COXIV were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies of caspase-3, Bak, Bcl-xL, VDAC1 (20B12), GRP78 (N-20), GRP78 (H-129), and Ub (P4D1) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-VDAC1/porin (20B12AF2), anti-pro-caspase-3, and anti-phosphoserine/threonine/tyrosine antibodies were from Abcam. The GSK3β antibody was obtained from BD Pharmingen. Antibodies of anti-β-actin and anti-GAPDH were obtained from Sigma. A full-length cDNA fragment of K5 was amplified from human adjacent non-tumor tissues of hepatocellular carcinoma with a pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF, a secreted glycoprotein) signal peptide and an artificially synthesized signal peptide added as described in a previous study (20Barash S. Wang W. Shi Y. Human secretory signal peptide description by hidden Markov model and generation of a strong artificial signal peptide for secreted protein expression.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA fragment of VDAC1 was isolated from HUVECs. His-K5-artificial synthesized signal peptide-pcDNA 3.1(+), His-K5-PEDF signal peptide-pcDNA 3.1(+), and Myc-VDAC1-pcDNA 3.1(+) (wild type) plasmids were constructed by inserting amplified K5 and VDAC1 genes into pcDNA 3.1(+) between the restriction sites of BamHI and XhoI. Four site-directed mutant plasmids of VDAC1 (Myc-VDAC1-S12A/T51A/S103A/T107A-pcDNA3.1(+)) were constructed with the help of GENEray (Generay Biotech, Shanghai, China). The His tag and Myc tag were added in the C-terminal of the target genes. The primer sequences for extracting the target genes were as follows: K5 with a PEDF signal peptide, 5′-TTAGGATCCTGCTACTCCTCTGCATTGGAGCCCTCCTCGGGCACAGCAGCTGCGAAGAAGACTGTATGTTTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCGCTCGAGTTAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGCGCACACTGAGGGACATC-3′ (reverse); K5 with an artificially synthesized signal peptide, 5′-TTAGGATCCATGTGGTGGCGCCTGTGGTGGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTGTGGCCCATGGTGTGGGCCGAAGAAGACTGTATGTTTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCGCTCGAGTTAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGCGCACACTGAGGGACATC-3′ (reverse); and VDAC1, 5′-TTAGGATCCATGGCTGTGCCACCCACGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCGCTCGAGTTACAGATCCTCTTCAGAGATGAGTTTCTGCTCTGCTTGAAATTCCAGTCC-3′(reverse). Plasmids pBiFC-K5VN155 and pBIFC-VDAC1VC155 were constructed as follows. The oligonucleotides of K5 with a PEDF signal peptide sequence and VDAC1 were cloned into the SalI-XhoI restriction sites in bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) eukaryotic expression plasmids pBiFC-VN155 (I152L) and pBiFC-VC155 (pCMV-HA backbone), respectively. The positive control plasmids for the subsequent BiFC assay were pBiFC-bJunVN55 (I152L) and pBiFC-bFosVC155 (pCMV-HA backbone); and the negative control plasmids for the BiFC assay were pBiFC-bJunVN55 and pBiFC-bFos(ΔZIP)VC155. All of the BiFC plasmids were presented by Dr. Changdeng Hu (Purdue University). The oligonucleotide sequences of primers for the BiFC plasmids were as follows: K5, 5′-ATTGTCGACTGCTACTCCTCTGCATTGGAGCCCTCCTCGGGCACAGCAGCTGCGAAGAAGACTGTATGTTTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATTCTCGAGTGCTACTCCTCTGCATTGGAGCCCTCCTCGGGCACAGCAGCTGCGAAGAAGACTGTATGTTTGG-3′(reverse); VDAC1, 5′-ATTGTCGACGATGGCTGTGCCACCCACGTAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCGCTCGAGTGCTTGAAATTCCAGTCCTAG-3′ (reverse). All of the plasmids were purified with a NucleoBond Xtra Midi EF Kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmids were delivered into HUVECs by electroporation using the NeonTM Transfection System (Invitrogen). The transfection of plasmids into HEK293 cells was carried out using Attractene reagent (Qiagen). The BiFC assay was performed as previously described (21Kodama Y. Hu C.D. An improved bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay with a high signal-to-noise ratio.BioTechniques. 2010; 49: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Plasmids pBiFC-K5VN155 and pBIFC-VDAC1VC155 were constructed by fusing K5 and VDAC1 to non-fluorescent fragments derived from the N-terminal and C-terminal of fluorescent Venus, respectively. When K5 and VDAC1 bind, the two non-fluorescent fragments get close and an intact fluorescent Venus is reconstituted. Under a fluorescence microscope, yellow fluorescence can then be visualized. For the BiFC assay, HEK293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with appropriate plasmids (0.25 μg each). Fluorescent images were similarly acquired 24 h post-transfection with YFP (EX515, EM528). The siRNAs for silencing VDAC1, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), and GSK3β genes, in addition to scrambled siRNA, which serves as a negative control, were purchased from RiboBio (Guangzhou, China). Transfection of synthetic siRNAs was performed using HiPerFect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sense sequences of the double-strand siRNA were as follows: siVDAC1, 5′-AGUGACGGGCAGUCUGGAATT-3′; siGRP78, 5′-CCAAGAUGCUGACAUUGAATT-3′; siGSK3β 001, 5′-AUAGUCCGAUUGCGUUAUU-3′; siGSK3β 002, 5′-AUCUUUGGAGCCACUGAUU-3′; and siGSK3β 003, 5′-GAUCUGUCUUGAAGGAGAA-3′. The qPCR was performed as previously described (22Wang R. Xie H. Huang Z. Ma J. Fang X. Ding Y. Sun Z. T cell factor 1 regulates thymocyte survival via a RORγt-dependent pathway.J.

In brief, total RNA was extracted from HUVECs by TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). 500 ng of total RNA was used for reverse transcription and qPCR. Target mRNA was determined using the capillary-based Light Cycler 2.0 Systems (Roche Diagnostics Corporation). β-actin was used as an internal control. The cDNA was amplified with special primers for VDAC1 (forward, 5′-AGATCAGCTTGCACGTGGACTGAAG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCGAAATCCATGTCGCAGCCCA-3′) and β-actin (forward, 5′-GTTGGCGTACAGGTCTTTGC-3′; reverse, 5′-GCACTCTTCCAGCCTTCCTT-3′). The mPTP opening was measured with a MitoProbe Transition Pore Assay Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes). Briefly, cells were collected and incubated with 2 μm calcein AM containing CoCl2, which selectively labels mitochondria as a quencher of calcein fluorescence, and ionomycin at 37 °C for 15 min. Next, a flow cytometer was used to assess the fluorescence with excitation at 488 nm. Black (calcein AM only), green (calcein AM and CoCl2), and pink (calcein AM, CoCl2, and ionomycin) peak shape lines were employed to indicate different intensities of subgroup cells. The mPTP opening was displayed by a reduction of mitochondrial calcein signal (green subgroups). Double staining was performed using an Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (KeyGEN, Nanjing, China) to measure apoptosis. Cells were cultured for 72 h and prepared as described elsewhere (24Lin C.S. Xie S.B. Liu J. Zhao Z.X. Chong Y.T. Gao Z.L. Effect of revaccination using different schemes among adults with low or undetectable anti-HBs titers after hepatitis B virus vaccination.Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2010; 17: 1548-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Annexin V and propidium iodide were added for incubation in the dark for 15 min at 4 °C, and then cells were analyzed by a flow cytometer (EPICS XL-MCL or Gallios, Beckman). For determination of caspase-3/7 activity, a caspase-3/7 luminescent activity assay was performed using a Caspase-Glo-3/7 Assay kit (Promega). Cells were harvested and lysed with 1× SDS lysis buffer and the subsequent Western blot analysis was performed as described elsewhere (25Xu G. Cheng L. Wen W. Oh Y. Mou Z. Shi J. Xu R. Li H. Inverse association between T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-1 and T-bet in a mouse model of allergic rhinitis.Laryngoscope. 2007; 117: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The procedures for immunoprecipitation have been described elsewhere (26Blomgran R. Zheng L. Stendahl O. Cathepsin-cleaved Bid promotes apoptosis in human neutrophils via oxidative stress-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2007; 81: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed for 20 min on ice in RIPA lysis buffer (Applygen, Beijing, China) supplemented protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and PMSF (Sigma). Lysates were pre-cleared then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibody and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (500 μg of protein; 5 μg of IgG; 50 μl of beads; Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with RIPA lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted from beads with SDS sample buffer and then subjected to Western blotting analysis. The assay that involved analysis of the cell surface expression of VDAC1 was used as previously described (27McFarland B.C. Stewart Jr., J. Hamza A. Nordal R. Davidson D.J. Henkin J. Gladson C.L. Plasminogen kringle 5 induces apoptosis of brain microvessel endothelial cells: sensitization by radiation and requirement for GRP78 and LRP1.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 5537-5545Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). First, cell surface proteins were labeled with biotin using Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were extracted using RIPA lysis buffer as indicated previously and immunoprecipitation was used to detect the special protein on cell surface. Antibodies against VDAC1 and IgG were incubated with cell lysates overnight. Finally Western blotting was used to detect the cell surface VDAC1. Isolation of mitochondria and cytosol fractions was performed using a Mitochondria Isolation Kit (APPLYGEN, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed twice with chilled PBS. Next, cells were harvested by scraping in PBS and placed in a glass homogenizer for homogenizing. The resulting homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The participations, including cell nucleus, plasma membrane debris, and non-lysed cells, were discarded. Then the supernatants were again centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the participations were discarded. Finally, the resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants, which contained cytosol fractions, were collected and served as controls for subsequent experiments. The resulting participations were the mitochondria fractions and resuspended in Mito-Cyto Isolation Buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. The resuspension solutions were homogenized 20 times on ice. Mitochondria and cytosol fractions were analyzed by Western blotting analysis. Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Multiple comparisons were assessed by one-way analysis of variance using SPSS 13.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL) and differences with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All experiments were performed at least three times. As our previous study showed, K5-stimulated apoptosis of activated endothelial cells was mediated by the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (16Gu X. Yao Y. Cheng R. Zhang Y. Dai Z. Wan G. Yang Z. Cai W. Gao G. Yang X. Plasminogen K5 activates mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in endothelial cells by regulating Bak and Bcl-x(L) subcellular distribution.Apoptosis. 2011; 16: 846-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To investigate whether VDAC1 plays a role in this process, mitochondrial and cytosol fractions were isolated after cells were treated with K5 for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1A, K5 significantly augmented the expression of mitochondrial VDAC1. Furthermore, K5 promoted the interaction of Bak and VDAC1 while reducing the interaction of Bcl-xL and VDAC1 (Fig. 1B). Consequently, the mitochondrial calcein signal (green subgroups) was reduced to 55.53 ± 2.87% compared with that of control group, which indicated mitochondrial membrane damage and mPTP opening (Fig. 1C). In addition, we observed that K5 increased the cytosol cytochrome c level in a dose-dependent manner and activated caspase-3 (Fig. 1, D and E). Taken together, these results suggest that K5-induced endothelial cells apoptosis may be mediated by VDAC1. Because the mitochondrial VDAC1 was up-regulated by K5, we next evaluated the effect of K5 on the expression of total VDAC1. We found that K5 dose dependently increased the expression of total VDAC1 at the protein level but not at the mRNA level (Fig. 2, A and B). Therefore, it is possible that K5 stabilizes the VDAC1 protein by inhibiting its ubiquitination. To test this hypothesis, we performed ubiquitination assays. The ubiquitination level of the VDAC1 protein was significantly decreased in the presence of K5 in HUVECs, demonstrating that K5 inhibited the ubiquitination of VDAC1 (Fig. 2C). The phosphorylation of VDAC1 contributes to the stability of VDAC1 (14Yuan S. Fu Y. Wang X. Shi H. Huang Y. Song X. Li L. Song N. Luo Y. Voltage-dependent anion channel 1 is involved in endostatin-induced endothelial cell apoptosis.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 2809-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Moreover, the AKT-GSK3β signaling pathway was reported to potentiate VDAC1 phosphorylation (28Pastorino J.G. Hoek J.B. Shulga N. Activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β disrupts the binding of hexokinase II to mitochondria by phosphorylating voltage-dependent anion channel and potentiates chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10545-10554Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). We therefore tried to demonstrate the role of AKT-GSK3β axis on modulation of VDAC1 in our study. As shown in Fig. 3A, K5 may inhibit the activity of AKT by decreasing p-AKT (Ser-473), which represents an active form of AKT, and subsequently activating GSK3β by reducing p-GSK3β (Ser-9), which stands for a non-active form of GSK3β. On activation of AKT with insulin, K5-induced up-regulation of VDAC1 was blocked (Fig. 3B). Similarly, GSK3β knockdown also reduced the VDAC1 protein level and diminished the effect of K5 on VDAC1 (Fig. 3C). Using co-IP analysis, we found that phosphorylated VDAC1 was increased by K5, and this effect was enhanced by AKT inhibitor, whereas attenuated by GSK3β inhibitor (Fig. 3D). In this experiment, β-catenin was employed as a validity indicator of AKT and GSK3β inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 3D, β-catenin was significantly reduced by the AKT inhibitor, whereas markedly up-regulated by the GSK3β inhibitor, suggesting that these inhibitors were indeed effective. In addition, we constructed four site-directed mutant plasmids (S12A/T51A/S103A/T107A) to investigate the phosphorylation sites responsible for VDAC1 stability by transfecting HUVECs and HEK293 cells. Two VDAC1 mutants (S12A and T107A) were shown to reduce the VDAC1 protein level (Fig. 3E). To further test the correlation between phosphorylation and degradation of VDAC1, two other VDAC1 mutants (S12D and T107D), which simulate constant phosphorylation of VDAC1, were constructed. As shown in Fig. 3A, S12D and T107D were both observed to increase the protein level of VDAC1 compared with that of the wild type. These results indicate that increasing VDAC1 phosphorylation through the AKT-GSK3β axis probably disturbs its degradation and results in VDAC1 accumulation under K5 treatment. On the other hand, VDAC1 per se may mediate the modulation of K5 on the AKT-GSK3β axis. In addition to occurrence on mitochondrial, VDAC1 was also noted on the cell membrane and was identified as a receptor of K5 (18Gonzalez-Gronow M. Kalfa T. Johnson C.E. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. The voltage-dependent anion channel is a receptor for plasminogen kringle 5 on human endothelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27312-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To verify the binding between K5 and VDAC1, plasmids of K5 and VDAC1 were constructed. The plasmids of K5 were added with a PEDF signal peptide (His-K5–1) and an artificially synthesized signal peptide (His-K5–2), which may favor secretion of the K5 protein to mimic the action of the extracellular recombinant K5 protein. The His-K5–1 plasmid was identified as being a more efficient secreting K5 protein into the supernatant than the His-K5-2 plasmid (Fig. 4A). Hence, we chose the His-K5-1 plasmid for the co-IP assay. We showed that K5 could bind with VDAC1 after treatment of HUVECs with K5 containing conditioned medium for 10 min (Fig. 4B). This K5/VDAC1 direct interaction was also confirmed using the BiFC assay by co-transfecting cells with pBiFC-K5VN155 containing a PEDF signal peptide and pBIFC-VDAC1VC155 plasmids. It was observed that there was a number of Venus fluorescence (yellow color) dispersed in the cytoplasm and cell surface (Fig. 4C). To further determine the receptor action of VDAC1, HKI protein, an important agonist of cell surface VDAC1 (29Gonzalez-Gronow M. Kaczowka S.J. Payne S. Wang F. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V.

PTCH53 is a homolog of the tumor suppressor PTCH1, the prototypical repressor of Hh signaling by the human G protein-coupled receptor SMO. We demonstrate that PTCH53 was highly responsive to wild type p53 in large and diverse panels of cultured human cells and expressed at significantly decreased levels in TP53 mutant human tumors.

The immortalized human retinal epithelial cell line hTERT-RPE1 was cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. Ccd-18Co and IMR-90 (ATCC) human fibroblast cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. DAOY medulloblastoma cells were cultured in minimum essential medium with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts (ATCC) and SMO−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (a gift from Dr. James Kim) were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS penicillin/streptomycin. RACE in the 5′ orientation was performed with the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion), using the gene-specific outer primer 5′-GAGGCCGAAGGTGATTGTC-3′ and the gene-specific inner primer 5′- CCTCCACCAGATCCAGCTC-3′. The full sequence of PTCH53 with the newly identified exons 1 and 2 has been deposited in GenBankTM (accession no. KJ534581). The alignment of the predicted PTCH53 protein and PTCH1 was performed with the Basic Alignment Search Tool (BLASTP, version 2.2.30+), which identified amino acid similarities and identities as well as gaps within regions of homology. Nutlin-3 (also known as nutlin-3a; Enzo Life Sciences) was dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 10 mm. Cells were treated with a final concentration of 10 μm. For activation of p53 by radiation, cells were exposed to a 137Cs γ-ray source at a dose rate of 100 centigrays/min. For chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were harvested 24 h after treatment and processed with the EZ-ChIP kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-p53 antibody (monoclonal DO1) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Primers used for amplification of the p53 binding site BS1 in PTCH53 were as follows: forward, 5′-AAAACAAGGAGAGGATGTTCTTTG-3′; reverse, 5′-TTCTCTGCTACTTCTCTGCCATA-3′. The PTCH53 BS2 site was probed with 5′-CACCGAGATGAAGGGCTAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCTCCATGCGCTCCTACTA-3′ (reverse). CDKN1A p53 binding site primers were 5′-CACCTTTCACCATTCCCCTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCAGCCCAAGGACAAAATAG-3′ (reverse). RNA was extracted and purified with TRIzol (Life Technologies) and treated with DNase I (Thermo Scientific). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with the Maxima First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate by quantitative RT-PCR with oligonucleotide primers using Maxima SYBR Green/Rox Master Mix (Thermo Scientific) and an ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method using GAPDH for normalization. Ct values greater than 35 were considered not detectable. The following primer pairs were used: PTCH53, 5′-AAGCCAGCTCTATTCGGACTTAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTTGACCCGCTGATCTTTG-3′ (reverse); CDKN1A, 5′-ACAGCAGAGGAAGACCATGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGGCTTCCTCTTGGAGAAGAT-3′ (reverse); PTCH1, 5′-CCACAGAAGCGCTCCTACA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGTAATTTCGCCCCTTCC-3′ (reverse); PTCH2, 5′-GGAATGATTGAGCGGATGATTGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCACCTGTGCCTTGTCTAGC-3′ (reverse); PTCHD1, 5′-AGCACCGTCTCTACTCGGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAACCTGGATCTTGGTGACAG-3′ (reverse); PTCHD2, 5′-GCTGGGCTCCTACTCCTACT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGGGTGCTCCAAACAGGAT-3′ (reverse); PTCHD3, 5′-ACCTAGAGGAGCATTACACCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAAGCGGTAGGAGTCGTTGG-3′ (reverse); NPC1, 5′-GTCTCCGAGTACACTCCCATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGCAGTAATGAAGACCAGCGA-3′ (reverse); GLI1, 5′-CCACGGGGAGCGGAAGGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTGGCATTGCTGAAGGCTTTACTG-3′ (reverse). The putative PTCH53 binding sites BS1 and BS2 were amplified and cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter in pBV-Luc (Addgene plasmid 16539). DLD-1 cells growing on 12-well plates were co-transfected with firefly luciferase reporter plasmids, the pGL4.74 Renilla luciferase reporter construct (Promega), and pCMV-p53 (wild type; Addgene 16434) or pCMV-p53 R175H (Addgene 16436). Lysates were collected 24 h after transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). For the assessment of the effects of Patched proteins on SMO activity, C3H10T1/2 cells or Smo−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts were transfected with 200 ng Gli-luciferase reporter plasmid, 200 ng of pGL4.74, 150 ng of SMO expression plasmid, and varying mass ratios of PTCH1, PTCHD1, or PTCH53 expression plasmids. Transfected cells were split into three wells 8 h after transfection. After 24 h, medium was replaced with DMEM containing reduced serum (0.5% FBS). Lysates were collected 72 h after transfection. Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activity was determined using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) with the Victor3 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Firefly luciferase readings were normalized to Renilla luciferase to correct for transfection efficiency. All experiments were performed in triplicate with at least three independent experiments.

For inducible knockdown of PTCH53, an shRNA cassette encoded by the sense sequence 5′- CGAGCCGTGCTGGAAATGA-3′ was cloned into the lentivector pINDUCER10 (14Meerbrey K.L. Hu G. Kessler J.D. Roarty K.

For generation of conditioned media, 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3-SHH-N, with Fugene HD (Promega). Control conditioned media from mock-transfected 293T cells or ShhN-conditioned media were collected 48 h after transfection and filtered through 0.45 μm filters. Cells were incubated for 24 h in medium with reduced serum (0.25% FBS). Conditioned media were added at a 1:5–1:20 dilution. Where indicated, purmorphamine (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 10 μm. To identify novel, high confidence p53 target genes, we evaluated transcripts that were differentially expressed in isogenic colorectal cancer cell lines harboring mutant or wild type TP53. The wild type TP53 alleles in HCT116, RKO, and SW48 had previously been knocked out by recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated gene targeting; the TP53 mutation harbored by DLD-1 cells had been reverted to wild type by a knock-in approach (10Sur S. Pagliarini R. Bunz F. Rago C. Diaz Jr., L.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Papadopoulos N. A panel of isogenic human cancer cells suggests a therapeutic approach for cancers with inactivated p53.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3964-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). A total of 21 genes were up-regulated at least 2-fold by ionizing radiation in a p53-dependent manner in each of these four isogenic cell pairs (10Sur S. Pagliarini R. Bunz F. Rago C. Diaz Jr., L.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Papadopoulos N. A panel of isogenic human cancer cells suggests a therapeutic approach for cancers with inactivated p53.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3964-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). One commonly p53-regulated probe was found to map to the uncharacterized gene C6ORF138. Transcripts from this locus encode a hypothetical protein with transmembrane domains that are associated with members of the Patched family. C6ORF138 had therefore been assigned the alternative designation PTCHD4. In light of the homology of this previously uncharacterized gene to members of the human Patched family and its possible regulation by p53, we hereafter refer to this gene as PTCH53. The Patched proteins are characterized by 12-transmembrane domains and feature a sterol-sensing motif and a second region that encompasses five additional transmembrane domains near the C terminus. This structural arrangement, first observed in the Patched protein encoded by Drosophila, is evolutionarily conserved (15Hausmann G. von Mering C. Basler K. The hedgehog signaling pathway: where did it come from?.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000146Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In humans, the prototypical Patched protein is encoded by PTCH1, a tumor suppressor that functions as the primary negative regulator of Hedgehog signaling. The predicted protein encoded by PTCH53 conformed to the general structure of the Patched proteins (Fig. 1A) and was found to share significant homology with PTCH1 in the two conserved regions (Fig. 1B). Alignment of the two protein sequences revealed a 219-amino acid block of homology around the sterol-sensing domain of PTCH1. In this region, 45% of the amino acids were in similar functional groups, and 25% were identical, with five gaps (2%). A 154-amino acid region of homology spanning the C-terminal transmembrane domain cluster was 46% similar and 23% identical, with 14 gaps (9%). Among the human Patched orthologs, only PTCH53 was induced in a p53-dependent manner by nutlin-3 (Fig. 1C), a drug that stabilizes and activates p53 by inhibiting the HDM2 ubiquitin ligase. To rigorously confirm the role of p53 in the transcriptional regulation of PTCH53, we first measured gene expression by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qPCR) in HCT116, RKO, and SW48 cells and in their respective TP53-knock-out derivatives. In this panel of colorectal cancer cells, PTCH53 transcripts were more abundant in TP53+/+ cells compared with isogenic TP53−/− cells. Incubation with nutlin-3 caused a TP53 genotype-dependent increase in PTCH53 expression in each cell pair (Fig. 2A). The ∼10-fold induction of PTCH53 in TP53 wild type cells was comparable in magnitude to the extensively studied p53 target gene CDKN1A (alternatively known as p21) in all three cell pairs. PTCH53 expression was similarly induced in a TP53-dependent manner when these cells were exposed to γ-irradiation, a potent stimulus of p53 activation (Fig. 2B). The abundance of PTCH53 transcripts was low in DLD-1 cells, which harbor a TP53 S241F mutation and express no wild type p53 (Fig. 2C). A derivative of DLD-1 in which this endogenous mutation had been repaired (10Sur S. Pagliarini R. Bunz F. Rago C. Diaz Jr., L.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Papadopoulos N. A panel of isogenic human cancer cells suggests a therapeutic approach for cancers with inactivated p53.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3964-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) exhibited up-regulation of both PTCH53 and CDKN1A (Fig. 2C). PTCH53 was similarly responsive to nutlin-3 in non-cancer cells, including diploid human fibroblasts derived from colon (Ccd-18Co) and lung (IMR90) (Fig. 2D). The kinetics of PTCH53 induction after treatment with nutlin-3 (Fig. 2E) and the magnitude of PTCH53 induction in response to increasing doses of ionizing radiation (Fig. 2F) were comparable with those of CDKN1A in HCT116 cells that harbor intact, wild type TP53 alleles. Direct p53 target genes are regulated through binding of the p53 tetramer to bipartite 20-bp sites conforming to the half-site consensus sequence RRRCWWGYYY (16el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Definition of a consensus binding site for p53.Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). We used the p53MH algorithm (17Hoh J. Jin S. Parrado T. Edington J. Levine A.J. Ott J. The p53MH algorithm and its application in detecting p53-responsive genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8467-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) to identify potential p53 binding sites in the vicinity of the PTCH53 locus. The nearest 20/20 match was located 42 kb upstream of the 5′ exon of PTCHD4, as annotated in GenBankTM (Fig. 3A). We employed the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method to determine whether additional upstream exons were located nearer to this putative binding site. Amplified cDNA products were sequenced and aligned to the human genome with the UCSC Human Genome Browser (18Kent W.J. BLAT–the BLAST-like alignment tool.Genome Res. 2002; 12: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (6154) Google Scholar). Two upstream exons were identified that were not included in the annotated PTCHD4 gene (Fig. 3A). RNAseq data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project (19Bernstein B.E. Birney E. Dunham I. Green E.D. Gunter C. Snyder M. ENCODE Project ConsortiumAn integrated encyclopedia of DNA elements in the human genome.Nature. 2012; 489: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11012) Google Scholar) indicated that the PTCH53 exon adjacent to the putative p53 binding site was actively transcribed (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, ENCODE data from this region exhibited DNase I hypersensitivity and expression of the chromatin marks H3K4Me3, H3K27Ac, and H3K4Me1, a pattern of epigenetic modifications that is consistent with an active promoter enhancer region (19Bernstein B.E. Birney E. Dunham I. Green E.D. Gunter C. Snyder M. ENCODE Project ConsortiumAn integrated encyclopedia of DNA elements in the human genome.Nature. 2012; 489: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11012) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). The putative start of transcription was positioned 22 bp downstream of the identified p53 binding site (Fig. 3A). When cloned into a luciferase reporter construct, this site (BS1) conferred responsiveness to wild type p53 but not to the cancer-associated R175H mutant (Fig. 3C). In contrast, a second putative binding site (BS2) located between exons 2 and 3 that matched the p53 consensus at 14 of 20 positions (Fig. 3A) was not p53-responsive (Fig. 3C). A direct, inducible interaction between p53 and the BS1 site was detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Binding of p53 to this site could be detected in untreated cells and was increased following treatment with nutlin-3 or ionizing radiation (IR; Fig. 3D). The inducible interaction between p53 and the PTCH53 element was similar to the interaction between p53 and the binding site previously identified in the CDKN1A locus (5el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. WAF1, a potential mediator of p53 tumor suppression.Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7916) Google Scholar). In contrast, no interaction was detected at the degenerate BS2 site (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that PTCH53 is a direct transcriptional target of p53. We next asked whether PTCH53 expression was related to TP53 status in larger panels of cell lines and tumors. Global gene expression data and TP53 genotype status were available for 1036 cell lines characterized in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (12Barretina J. Caponigro G. Stransky N. Venkatesan K.

In this extensive data set, PTCH53 was expressed at significantly lower levels in cell lines harboring TP53 mutations, as was the prototypic p53 target gene CDKN1A (Fig. 4A). The dependence of PTCH53 expression on functional p53 was most apparent and highly statistically significant in cell lines derived from tumors in the central nervous system and skin (Fig. 4B) and could be observed in other tissues as well. TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in 12 types of cancer extensively profiled in the Cancer Genome Atlas. Of more than 3000 annotated tumors, 42% harbor a TP53 mutation (20Kandoth C. McLellan M.D. Vandin F. Ye K. Niu B. Lu C. Xie M. Zhang Q. McMichael J.F. Wyczalkowski M.A. Leiserson M.D. Miller C.A. Welch J.S. Walter M.J. Wendl M.C. Ley T.J. Wilson R.K. Raphael B.J. Ding L. Mutational landscape and significance across 12 major cancer types.Nature. 2013; 502: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (2928) Google Scholar). Comprehensive mutational and expression data were available for melanomas, glioblastomas, colorectal cancers, and breast cancers. In each of these four tumor types, PTCH53 and CDKN1A were both expressed at relatively high levels in tumors that retained wild type TP53 (Fig. 4C). Such a clear TP53 genotype-dependent pattern of expression in multiple cancer types was not observed for many other genes that have been demonstrated to be responsive to p53 in vitro (Fig. 5) Among the 80 previously identified and experimentally validated p53 targets that we queried in this fashion, only six genes, PTCH53, CDKN1A, DDB2, CCNG1, RP27L, and FDXR, were differentially expressed at a high degree of significance (p < 0.01) in TP53 wild type and TP53 mutant tumors in all four tumor types (Fig. 5 and Table 1). Forty-eight genes were more highly expressed (p < 0.01) in TP53 wild type tumors from at least one of the four types of cancer; 11 genes were differentially expressed in one or more tumor types at lower levels of significance (p < 0.05).

Open table in a new tab PTCH1 potently represses human Hh signaling by counteracting the activity of the seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor SMO. In this canonical Hh pathway, the binding of a Hh ligand by PTCH1 relieves the repression of SMO and results in the downstream activation of the GLI family of transcription factors (21Robbins D.J. Fei D.L. Riobo N.A. The Hedgehog signal transduction network.Sci. Signal. 2012; 5: re6Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Hh signaling is repressed in most adult tissues, but mutations in PTCH1, SMO, or the downstream mediator encoded by SUFU cause constitutive, ligand-independent activation of Hh signaling in cancers (22Barakat M.T.

https://openalex.org/W2008456888,"The innate immune system plays a major role in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Recently we reported complement activation in human NASH. However, it remained unclear whether the alternative pathway of complement, which amplifies C3 activation and which is frequently associated with pathological complement activation leading to disease, was involved. Here, alternative pathway components were investigated in liver biopsies of obese subjects with healthy livers (n = 10) or with NASH (n = 12) using quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining. Properdin accumulated in areas where neutrophils surrounded steatotic hepatocytes, and colocalized with the C3 activation product C3c. C3 activation status as expressed by the C3c/native C3 ratio was 2.6-fold higher (p<0.01) in subjects with NASH despite reduced native C3 concentrations (0.94±0.12 vs. 0.57±0.09; p<0.01). Hepatic properdin levels positively correlated with levels of C3c (rs = 0.69; p<0.05) and C3c/C3 activation ratio (rs = 0.59; p<0.05). C3c, C3 activation status (C3c/C3 ratio) and properdin levels increased with higher lobular inflammation scores as determined according to the Kleiner classification (C3c: p<0.01, C3c/C3 ratio: p<0.05, properdin: p<0.05). Hepatic mRNA expression of factor B and factor D did not differ between subjects with healthy livers and subjects with NASH (factor B: 1.00±0.19 vs. 0.71±0.07, p = 0.26; factor D: 1.00±0.21 vs. 0.66±0.14, p = 0.29;). Hepatic mRNA and protein levels of Decay Accelerating Factor tended to be increased in subjects with NASH (mRNA: 1.00±0.14 vs. 2.37±0.72; p = 0.22; protein: 0.51±0.11 vs. 1.97±0.67; p = 0.28). In contrast, factor H mRNA was downregulated in patients with NASH (1.00±0.09 vs. 0.71±0.06; p<0.05) and a similar trend was observed with hepatic protein levels (1.12±0.16 vs. 0.78±0.07; p = 0.08). Collectively, these data suggest a role for alternative pathway activation in driving hepatic inflammation in NASH. Therefore, alternative pathway factors may be considered attractive targets for treating NASH by inhibiting complement activation."
https://openalex.org/W2058367452,"In the last decade, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET and PET/CT) has become one of the major diagnostic tools used in oncology. A significant number of patients who undergo this procedure, due to non-thyroidal reasons, present incidental uptake of (18F-FDG) in the thyroid. The aim of the study was to compare the SUVmax (standardized uptake value) of thyroid focal lesions, which were incidentally found on PET/CT, in relation to the results of thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and/or histopathological evaluation.Patients referred for PET/CT examination, due to non-thyroidal illness, presented focal 18F-FDG uptake in the thyroid and were advised to undergo ultrasonography (US), hormonal evaluation, FNAB and/or total thyroidectomy at our institution.6614 PET/CT examinations performed in 5520 patients were analyzed. Of the 122 patients with focal thyroid 18F-FDG activity, 82 patients (67.2%) underwent further thyroid evaluation using FNAB. Benign lesions were diagnosed in 46 patients, malignant - in 19 patients (confirmed by post-surgical histopathology), while 17 patients had inconclusive results of cytological assessment. Mean SUVmax of benign lesions was 3.2±2.8 (median = 2.4), while the mean SUVmax value for malignant lesions was 7.1±8.2 (median = 3.5). The risk of malignancy was 16.7% for lesions with a SUVmax under 3, 43.8% for lesions with a SUVmax between 3 and 6, and 54.6% for lesions with a SUVmax over 6. In the group of malignant lesions, a positive correlation between the lesion's diameter and SUVmax was observed (p = 0.03, r = 0.57).Subjects with incidental focal uptake of 18F-FDG in thyroid are at a high risk of thyroid malignancy. A high value of SUVmax further increases the risk of malignancy, indicating the necessity for further cytological or histological evaluation. However, as SUVmax correlated with the diameter of malignant lesions, small lesions with focal uptake of 18F-FDG should be interpreted cautiously."

Our objective in this study was to define the glycosylation changes leading to this phenotype to better understand how these changes lead to pathogen resistance. We performed MALDI-TOF MS, tandem MS and GC/MS experiments to reveal fine structural detail for the bus-4 N- and O-glycan pools. We observed dramatic changes in O-glycans and moderate ones in N-glycan pools compared to the parent strain. Ce core-I glycans, the nematode's mucin glycan equivalent, were doubled in abundance, halved in charge and bore shifts in terminal substitutions. The fucosyl O-glycans, Ce core-II and neutral fucosyl forms, were also increased in abundance as were fucosyl N-glycans. Quantitative expression analysis revealed that two mucins, let-653 and osm-8, were upregulated nearly 40 fold and also revealed was a dramatic increase in GDP-Man 4,6 dehydratease expression. We performed detailed lectin binding studies that showed changes in glycoconjugates in the surface coat, cuticle surface and intestine. The combined changes in cell surface glycoconjugate distribution, increased abundance and altered properties of mucin provide an environment where likely the above pathogens are not exposed to normal glycoconjugate dependent cues leading to barriers to these bacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W1997093519,"ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) small GTPase regulates membrane trafficking and cytoskeleton rearrangements at the plasma membrane (PM) by cycling between the GTP-bound active and GDP-bound inactive conformations. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate ARF6. The exchange factor for ARF6 (EFA6) R has been identified as a biomarker for ovarian cancer. EFA6R shares the catalytic Sec7, pleckstrin homology (PH), and coiled coil (CC) domains of the other EFA6 family GEFs. Here we report the functional characterization of EFA6R. Endogenous EFA6R was present in the plasma membrane fraction. The exogenously expressed FLAG- and GFP-tagged EFA6R were targeted to the PM. In vitro, GFP-EFA6R associated weakly but preferentially with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) through the PH domain. EFA6R required both its PH and CC domains localized at the C terminus to target the PM. Consistent with this, EFA6R lacking the CC domain (EFA6RΔCC) was released from the PM into the cytosol upon PIP2 depletion, whereas EFA6R release from the PM required both PIP2 depletion and actin destabilization. These results suggest that the dual targeting via the PH and CC domains is important for the PM localization of EFA6R. EFA6R specifically catalyzed the GTP loading of ARF6 in mammalian cells. Moreover, EFA6R regulated ARF6 localization and thereby actin stress fiber loss. The GEF activity of EFA6R was dependent on the presence of the Sec7 domain. The PH and CC domains were also required for the in vivo GEF activity of EFA6R but could be functionally replaced by the CAAX motif of K-Ras, suggesting a role for these domains in the membrane targeting of EFA6R."
https://openalex.org/W2039264033,"Vision requires the generation of cone and rod photoreceptors that function in daylight and dim light, respectively. The neural retina leucine zipper factor (NRL) transcription factor critically controls photoreceptor fates as it stimulates rod differentiation and suppresses cone differentiation. However, the controls over NRL induction that balance rod and cone fates remain unclear. We have reported previously that the retinoid-related orphan receptor β gene (Rorb) is required for Nrl expression and other retinal functions. We show that Rorb differentially expresses two isoforms: RORβ2 in photoreceptors and RORβ1 in photoreceptors, progenitor cells, and other cell types. Deletion of RORβ2 or RORβ1 increased the cone:rod ratio ∼2-fold, whereas deletion of both isoforms in Rorb(-/-) mice produced almost exclusively cone-like cells at the expense of rods, suggesting that both isoforms induce Nrl. Electroporation of either RORβ isoform into retinal explants from Rorb(-/-) neonates reactivated Nrl and rod genes but, in Nrl(-/-) explants, failed to reactivate rod genes, indicating that NRL is the effector for both RORβ isoforms in rod differentiation. Unexpectedly, RORβ2 expression was lost in Nrl(-/-) mice. Moreover, NRL activated the RORβ2-specific promoter of Rorb, indicating that NRL activates Rorb, its own inducer gene. We suggest that feedback activation between Nrl and Rorb genes reinforces the commitment to rod differentiation."

This rock inhabiting, microcolonial fungus is extremely stress tolerant and it is a model organism for exobiology and studies on stress resistance in Eukaryots. Since this fungus is a specialist in the most extreme environment of the Earth, the analysis of its genome is of important value for the understanding of fungal genome evolution and stress adaptation. A comparison with Neurospora crassa as well as with other microcolonial fungi shows that the fungus has a genome size of 24 Mbp, which is the average in the fungal kingdom. Although sexual reproduction was never observed in this fungus, 34 mating genes are present with protein homologs in the classes Eurotiomycetes, Sordariomycetes and Dothideomycetes. The first analysis of the draft genome did not reveal any significant deviations of this genome from comparative species and mesophilic hyphomycetes."
https://openalex.org/W2109487828,"Carbon-13 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C MRS) offers a noninvasive method to assess glycogen levels in skeletal muscle and to identify excess glycogen accumulation in patients with glycogen storage disease (GSD). Despite the clinical potential of the method, it is currently not widely used for diagnosis or for follow-up of treatment. While it is possible to perform acceptable 13C MRS at lower fields, the low natural abundance of 13C and the inherently low signal-to-noise ratio of 13C MRS makes it desirable to utilize the advantage of increased signal strength offered by ultra-high fields for more accurate measurements. Concomitant with this advantage, however, ultra-high fields present unique technical challenges that need to be addressed when studying glycogen. In particular, the question of measurement reproducibility needs to be answered so as to give investigators insight into meaningful inter-subject glycogen differences. We measured muscle glycogen levels in vivo in the calf muscle in three patients with McArdle disease (MD), one patient with phosphofructokinase deficiency (PFKD) and four healthy controls by performing 13C MRS at 7T. Absolute quantification of the MRS signal was achieved by using a reference phantom with known concentration of metabolites. Muscle glycogen concentration was increased in GSD patients (31.5±2.9 g/kg w. w.) compared with controls (12.4±2.2 g/kg w. w.). In three GSD patients glycogen was also determined biochemically in muscle homogenates from needle biopsies and showed a similar 2.5-fold increase in muscle glycogen concentration in GSD patients compared with controls. Repeated inter-subject glycogen measurements yield a coefficient of variability of 5.18%, while repeated phantom measurements yield a lower 3.2% system variability. We conclude that noninvasive ultra-high field 13C MRS provides a valuable, highly reproducible tool for quantitative assessment of glycogen levels in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W1974975488,"The phycobilisome (PBS) is an extremely large light-harvesting complex, common in cyanobacteria and red algae, composed of rods and core substructures. These substructures are assembled from chromophore-bearing phycocyanin and allophycocyanin subunits, nonpigmented linker proteins and in some cases additional subunits. To date, despite the determination of crystal structures of isolated PBS components, critical questions regarding the interaction and energy flow between rods and core are still unresolved. Additionally, the arrangement of minor PBS components located inside the core cylinders is unknown. Different models of the general architecture of the PBS have been proposed, based on low resolution images from electron microscopy or high resolution crystal structures of isolated components. This work presents a model of the assembly of the rods onto the core arrangement and for the positions of inner core components, based on cross-linking and mass spectrometry analysis of isolated, functional intact Thermosynechococcus vulcanus PBS, as well as functional cross-linked adducts. The experimental results were utilized to predict potential docking interactions of different protein pairs. Combining modeling and cross-linking results, we identify specific interactions within the PBS subcomponents that enable us to suggest possible functional interactions between the chromophores of the rods and the core and improve our understanding of the assembly, structure, and function of PBS."
https://openalex.org/W2046076383,"Polylaminin (polyLM) is a non-covalent acid-induced nano- and micro-structured polymer of the protein laminin displaying distinguished biological properties. Polylaminin stimulates neuritogenesis beyond the levels achieved by ordinary laminin and has been shown to promote axonal regeneration in animal models of spinal cord injury. Here we used confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterize its three-dimensional structure. Renderization of confocal optical slices of immunostained polyLM revealed the aspect of a loose flocculated meshwork, which was homogeneously stained by the antibody. On the other hand, an ordinary matrix obtained upon adsorption of laminin in neutral pH (LM) was constituted of bulky protein aggregates whose interior was not accessible to the same anti-laminin antibody. SEM and AFM analyses revealed that the seed unit of polyLM was a flat polygon formed in solution whereas the seed structure of LM was highly heterogeneous, intercalating rod-like, spherical and thin spread lamellar deposits. As polyLM was visualized at progressively increasing magnifications, we observed that the morphology of the polymer was alike independently of the magnification used for the observation. A search for the Hausdorff dimension in images of the two matrices showed that polyLM, but not LM, presented fractal dimensions of 1.55, 1.62 and 1.70 after 1, 8 and 12 hours of adsorption, respectively. Data in the present work suggest that the intrinsic fractal nature of polymerized laminin can be the structural basis for the fractal-like organization of basement membranes in the neurogenic niches of the central nervous system."

Ubiquitin-binding proteins play a critical role in recognizing and relaying polyubiquitin-based signaling. NEMO (NF-κB Essential Modulator) is a central player in canonical NF-κB signaling whose major function is to bind to Lys-63- and/or M1- (or linear) linked polyubiquitin chains generated in response to cell stimulation. Here we show that Withaferin A (WA), a steroidal lactone, causes a change in NEMO's interaction with specific types of polyubiquitin chains in vitro. WA induces full-length recombinant NEMO to bind to long Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains but not tetra-ubiquitin species. Significantly, the UBAN (ubiquitin binding in ABIN and NEMO) domain, essential for the ability of NEMO to bind M1/Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin, is dispensable for the WA-induced gain-of-function activity. Mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that WA covalently modifies NEMO on a cysteine residue within the C-terminal zinc finger (ZF) domain. Point mutations to the ZF can reverse the WA-induced Lys-48-polyubiquitin binding phenotype.

During the first half-reaction, FAD is reduced to FADH2 and reoxidized in the second half-reaction by reducing molecular oxygen to H2O2. Alternative electron acceptors including quinones, radicals or chelated metal ions show significant and in some cases even higher activity. While oxygen as cheap and abundantly available electron acceptor is favored for many processes, reduced oxygen reactivity is desirable for some applications such as in biosensors/biofuel cells because of reduced oxidative damages to the biocatalyst from concomitant H2O2 production as well as reduced electron “leakage” to oxygen. The reactivity of flavoproteins with oxygen is of considerable scientific interest, and the determinants of oxygen activation and reactivity are the subject of numerous studies. We applied site-saturation mutagenesis on a set of eleven amino acids around the active site based on the crystal structure of the enzyme. Using microtiter plate screening assays with peroxidase/2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, variants of POx with decreased oxidase activity and maintained dehydrogenase activity were identified. Variants T166R, Q448H, L545C, L547R and N593C were characterized with respect to their apparent steady-state constants with oxygen and the alternative electron acceptors DCPIP, 1,4-benzoquinone and ferricenium ion, and the effect of the mutations was rationalized based on structural properties."
https://openalex.org/W2101839177,"Background Memory T-cells are mediators of transplant injury, and no therapy is known to prevent the development of cross-reactive memory alloimmunity. Activated vitamin D is immunomodulatory, and vitamin D deficiency, common in hemodialysis patients awaiting transplantation, is associated with a heightened alloimmune response. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that vitamin D3 supplementation would prevent alloreactive T-cell memory formation in vitamin D-deficient hemodialysis patients. Methods and Findings We performed a 12-month single-center pilot randomized, controlled trial of 50,000 IU/week of cholecalciferol (D3) versus no supplementation in 96 hemodialysis patients with serum 25(OH)D<25 ng/mL, measuring effects on serum 25(OH)D and phenotypic and functional properties of T-cells. Participants were randomized 2∶1 to active treatment versus control. D3 supplementation increased serum 25(OH)D at 6 weeks (13.5 [11.2] ng/mL to 42.5 [18.5] ng/mL, p<0.001) and for the duration of the study. No episodes of sustained hypercalcemia occurred in either group. Results of IFNγ ELISPOT-based panel of reactive T-cell assays (PRT), quantifying alloreactive memory, demonstrated greater increases in the controls over 1 year compared to the treatment group (delta PRT in treatment 104.8+/−330.8 vs 252.9+/−431.3 in control), but these changes in PRT between groups did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.25). Conclusions D3 supplements are safe, effective at treating vitamin D deficiency, and may prevent time-dependent increases in T-cell alloimmunity in hemodialysis patients, but their effects on alloimmunity need to be confirmed in larger studies. These findings support the routine supplementation of vitamin D-deficient transplant candidates on hemodialysis and highlight the need for large-scale prospective studies of vitamin D supplementation in transplant candidates and recipients.

https://openalex.org/W1982679491,"Transgenic expression of B- and T-cell receptors (BCRs and TCRs, respectively) has been a standard tool to study lymphocyte development and function in vivo. The generation of transgenic mice is time-consuming and, therefore, a faster method to study the biology of defined lymphocyte receptors in vivo would be highly welcome. Using 2A peptide-linked multicistronic retroviral vectors to transduce stem cells, TCRs can be expressed rapidly in mice of any background. We aimed at adopting this retrogenic technology to the in vivo expression of BCRs. Using a well characterised BCR specific for hen egg lysozyme (HEL), we achieved surface expression of the retrogenically encoded BCR in a Rag-deficient pro B-cell line in vitro. In vivo, retrogenic BCRs were detectable only intracellularly but not on the surface of B cells from wild type or Rag2-deficient mice. This data, together with the fact that no BCR retrogenic mouse model has been published in the 7 years since the method was originally published for TCRs, strongly suggests that achieving BCR-expression in vivo with retrogenic technology is highly challenging if not impossible."
https://openalex.org/W2002354949,"Background To determine whether the predictions of functional outcome after ischemic stroke made at the bedside using a doctor’s clinical experience were more or less accurate than the predictions made by clinical prediction models (CPMs). Methods and Findings A prospective cohort study of nine hundred and thirty one ischemic stroke patients recruited consecutively at the outpatient, inpatient and emergency departments of the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh between 2002 and 2005. Doctors made informal predictions of six month functional outcome on the Oxford Handicap Scale (OHS). Patients were followed up at six months with a validated postal questionnaire. For each patient we calculated the absolute predicted risk of death or dependence (OHS≥3) using five previously described CPMs. The specificity of a doctor’s informal predictions of OHS≥3 at six months was good 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94 to 0.97) and similar to CPMs (range 0.94 to 0.96); however the sensitivity of both informal clinical predictions 0.44 (95% CI: 0.39 to 0.49) and clinical prediction models (range 0.38 to 0.45) was poor. The prediction of the level of disability after stroke was similar for informal clinical predictions (ordinal c-statistic 0.74 with 95% CI 0.72 to 0.76) and CPMs (range 0.69 to 0.75). No patient or clinician characteristic affected the accuracy of informal predictions, though predictions were more accurate in outpatients. Conclusions CPMs are at least as good as informal clinical predictions in discriminating between good and bad functional outcome after ischemic stroke. The place of these models in clinical practice has yet to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2087696768,"Given an extrinsic challenge, an organism may die or not depending on how the threat interacts with the organism's physiological state. To date, such interaction mortality has been only a minor factor in theoretical modeling of senescence. We describe a model of interaction mortality that does not involve specific functions, making only modest assumptions. Our model distinguishes explicitly between the physiological state of an organism and potential extrinsic, age-independent threats. The resulting mortality may change with age, depending on whether the organism's state changes with age. We find that depending on the physiological constraints, any outcome, be it 'no senescence' or 'high rate of senescence', can be found in any environment; that the highest optimal rate of senescence emerges for an intermediate physiological constraint, i.e. intermediate strength of trade-off; and that the optimal rate of senescence as a function of the environment is driven by the way the environment changes the effect of the organism's state on mortality. We conclude that knowledge about the environment, physiology and their interaction is necessary before reasonable predictions about the evolution of senescence can be made."
https://openalex.org/W1968089259,"The spontaneous self-organization of conformational isomers from identical precursors is of fundamental importance in chemistry. Since the precursors are identical, it is the multi-unit interactions, characteristics of the intermediates, and assembly pathways that determine the final conformation. Here, we use geometric path sampling and a mesoscale experimental model to investigate the self-assembly of a model polyhedral system, an octahedron, that forms two isomers. We compute the set of all possible assembly pathways and analyze the degrees of freedom or rigidity of intermediates. Consequently, by manipulating the degrees of freedom of a precursor, we were able to experimentally enrich the formation of one isomer over the other. Our results suggest a new approach to direct pathways in both natural and synthetic self-assembly using simple geometric criteria. We also compare the process of folding and unfolding in this model with a geometric model for cyclohexane, a well-known molecule with chair and boat conformations."
https://openalex.org/W2024390749,"Zinc finger protein 36, C3H type-like 1 (ZFP36L1) is one of several Zinc Finger Protein 36 (Zfp36) family members, which bind AU rich elements within 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) to negatively regulate the post-transcriptional expression of targeted mRNAs. The prototypical member of the family, Tristetraprolin (TTP or ZFP36), has been well-studied in the context of inflammation and plays an important role in repressing pro-inflammatory transcripts such as TNF-α. Much less is known about the other family members, and none have been studied in the context of infection. Using macrophage cell lines and primary alveolar macrophages we demonstrated that, like ZFP36, ZFP36L1 is prominently induced by infection. To test our hypothesis that macrophage production of ZFP36L1 is necessary for regulation of the inflammatory response of the lung during pneumonia, we generated mice with a myeloid-specific deficiency of ZFP36L1. Surprisingly, we found that myeloid deficiency of ZFP36L1 did not result in alteration of lung cytokine production after infection, altered clearance of bacteria, or increased inflammatory lung injury. Although alveolar macrophages are critical components of the innate defense against respiratory pathogens, we concluded that myeloid ZFP36L1 is not essential for appropriate responses to bacteria in the lungs. Based on studies conducted with myeloid-deficient ZFP36 mice, our data indicate that, of the Zfp36 family, ZFP36 is the predominant negative regulator of cytokine expression in macrophages. In conclusion, these results imply that myeloid ZFP36 may fully compensate for loss of ZFP36L1 or that Zfp36l1-dependent mRNA expression does not play an integral role in the host defense against bacterial pneumonia."

The rates, types and significance of the pharmacists' interventions in the different settings were compared.A total of 982 interventions were documented, related to the 16,700 medication orders reviewed on the five wards in the three practice settings over the duration of the study. Taking medication histories and/or patient counselling were the most common pharmacists' interventions in the general settings; constituting more than half of all interventions. On the Hematology-Oncology Ward the pattern was different with drug therapy changes being the most common interventions (n = 73/195, 37.4% of all interventions). Active interventions (pharmacists' activities leading to a change in drug therapy) constituted less than a quarter of all interventions on the general medical and surgical wards compared to nearly half on the specialty Hematology-Oncology Ward. The majority (n = 37/42, 88.1%) of a random sample of the active interventions reviewed were rated as clinically significant. Dose adjustment was the most frequent active interventions in the general settings, whilst drug addition constituted the most common active interventions on the Hematology-Oncology Ward. The degree of acceptance of pharmacists' active interventions by prescribers was high (n = 223/244, 91.4%).The rate of pharmacists' active interventions differed across different practice settings, being most frequent in the specialty hematology-oncology setting. The nature and type of the interventions documented in the hematology-oncology were also different compared to those in the general medical and surgical settings."
https://openalex.org/W1998272250,"Evaluation of blood supply of different organs relies on labeling blood with a suitable tracer. The tracer kinetics is linear: Tracer concentration at an observation site is a linear response to an input somewhere upstream the arterial flow. The corresponding impulse response functions are currently treated empirically without incorporating the relation to the vascular morphology of an organ. In this work we address this relation for the first time. We demonstrate that the form of the response function in the entire arterial tree is reduced to that of individual vessel segments under approximation of good blood mixing at vessel bifurcations. The resulting expression simplifies significantly when the geometric scaling of the vascular tree is taken into account. This suggests a new way to access the vascular morphology in vivo using experimentally determined response functions. However, it is an ill-posed inverse problem as demonstrated by an example using measured arterial spin labeling in large brain arteries. We further analyze transport in individual vessel segments and demonstrate that experimentally accessible tracer concentration in vessel segments depends on the measurement principle. Explicit expressions for the response functions are obtained for the major middle part of the arterial tree in which the blood flow in individual vessel segments can be treated as laminar. When applied to the analysis of regional cerebral blood flow measurements for which the necessary arterial input is evaluated in the carotid arteries, present theory predicts about 20% underestimation, which is in agreement with recent experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W2010629174,"Mitochondrial DNA depletion caused by thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) deficiency can be compensated by a nucleoside kinase from Drosophila melanogaster (Dm-dNK) in mice. We show that transgene expression of Dm-dNK in Tk2 knock-out (Tk2(-/-)) mice extended the life span of Tk2(-/-) mice from 3 weeks to at least 20 months. The Dm-dNK(+/-)Tk2(-/-) mice maintained normal mitochondrial DNA levels throughout the observation time. A significant difference in total body weight due to the reduction of subcutaneous and visceral fat in the Dm-dNK(+/-)Tk2(-/-) mice was the only visible difference compared with control mice. This indicates an effect on fat metabolism mediated through residual Tk2 deficiency because Dm-dNK expression was low in both liver and fat tissues. Dm-dNK expression led to increased dNTP pools and an increase in the catabolism of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides but these alterations did not apparently affect the mice during the 20 months of observation. In conclusion, Dm-dNK expression in the cell nucleus expanded the total dNTP pools to levels required for efficient mitochondrial DNA synthesis, thereby compensated the Tk2 deficiency, during a normal life span of the mice. The Dm-dNK(+/-) mouse serves as a model for nucleoside gene or enzyme substitutions, nucleotide imbalances, and dNTP alterations in different tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2183988066,"The obligate intracellular parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, disseminates through its host inside infected immune cells. We hypothesize that parasite nutrient requirements lead to manipulation of migratory properties of the immune cell. We demonstrate that 1) T. gondii relies on glutamine for optimal infection, replication and viability, and 2) T. gondii-infected bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) display both ""hypermotility"" and ""enhanced migration"" to an elevated glutamine gradient in vitro. We show that glutamine uptake by the sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter 2 (SNAT2) is required for this enhanced migration. SNAT2 transport of glutamine is also a significant factor in the induction of migration by the small cytokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in uninfected DCs. Blocking both SNAT2 and C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4; the unique receptor for SDF-1) blocks hypermotility and the enhanced migration in T. gondii-infected DCs. Changes in host cell protein expression following T. gondii infection may explain the altered migratory phenotype; we observed an increase of CD80 and unchanged protein level of CXCR4 in both T. gondii-infected and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated DCs. However, unlike activated DCs, SNAT2 expression in the cytosol of infected cells was also unchanged. Thus, our results suggest an important role of glutamine transport via SNAT2 in immune cell migration and a possible interaction between SNAT2 and CXCR4, by which T. gondii manipulates host cell motility."
https://openalex.org/W2056592016,"Objective of this study was to describe intraocular measurements in newly born foals (1–7 days of age) and assess the association between globe measurements and gender, laterality, and body weight. B-scan ultrasonographic biometry was performed on both eyes of 22 healthy foals (44 eyes) ages 1–7 days using a 10-MHz transducer. Intraocular measurements (anterior chamber depth, central lens thickness, vitreous chamber depth, axial globe length, longitudinal globe length, lens poles distance) were carried out using the ultrasound internal calipers. The influence of gender (male or female), laterality (right or left eye), and body weight (“light” <48 kg; “heavy” ≥48 kg) on ocular measurements was analysed by the Student t test. Values of P<0.05 were accepted as significant for all analyses. Mean anterior chamber depth was 2.2±0.5 mm (Standard Deviation); central lens thickness was 9.9±0.8 mm; vitreous chamber depth was 15.5±1.1 mm; axial globe length was 27.6±1.6 mm; longitudinal globe length was 35.8±1.2 mm, and lens poles distance was 16.4±1.0 mm. Intraocular measurements were not influenced by gender, laterality nor body weight. This study provides reference values for intraocular measurements in neonatal foals and may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of congenital and acquired pathologies involving the globe."
https://openalex.org/W2010171319,"The use of nicotine in the form of “snus” is substantial and increasing in some geographic areas, in particular among young people. It has previously been suggested that addictions may operate through a mechanism of attentional bias, in which stimuli representative of the dependent substance increase in salience, thus increasing the addictive behavior. However, this hypothesis has not been tested for the case of snus. The current experiment used a modified Stroop task and a dot-probe task to investigate whether 40 snus users show an attentional bias towards snus-relevant stimuli, compared to 40 non-snus users. There were no significant differences between the two groups on reaction times or accuracy on either Stroop or dot-probe task, thus failing to show an attentional bias towards snus-relevant stimuli for snus users. This could imply that other mechanisms may contribute to maintenance of snus use than for other addictions. However, this is the first experimental study investigating attentional bias in snus users, and more research is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W1978914107,"The nature of ultraluminous X-ray astronomical sources has long been unclear. The latest observations of these rare systems provide some crucial clues, but still leave theorists scratching their heads. See Letters p.198
 & p.202
 Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are non-nuclear point sources that are widely believed to contain either intermediate mass black holes or smaller, stellar mass black holes accreting from a binary companion. The study of ULXs provides information about black hole formation and/or modes of high Eddington rate accretion. Two papers in this issue of Nature describe pulsating ULXs with unusual properties. Christian Motch et al. find that source P13 in the galaxy NGC 7793 is in a ∼64 day period binary system. By modelling the strong optical and UV modulations arising from X-ray heating of the B9Ia donor star, they constrain the black hole mass to be less than 15 solar masses. Matteo Bachetti et al. observe a source in the galaxy M82 that, the pulsation data imply, harbours a neutron star rather than a black hole, raising doubts over the assumption that black holes power the most luminous X-ray binaries."
