Objective To assess the differential effects of pre-infection glucose levels on the risk for severe COVID-19 amongst patients with and without diabetes. Design Population based historical cohort study. Setting National state-mandated HMO. Patients All adult patients with a positive SARS-COV2 test between March-October 2020. Exposure Recent fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin (HBA1C), age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and diagnoses of diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease. Outcome Risk for severe COVID-19, defined as resulting in ≥10 hospitalization days, ICU admission or death. Results 37,121 patients with a positive SARS-COV2 test were identified; 707 defined as severe (1.9%). Unadjusted risk factors for severe disease were age (OR = 1.1 for every year increase; 95% CI 1.09–1.11, p &lt; 0.001), male gender (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.06–1.68, p = 0.012); BMI (OR = 1.02 for 1 kg/m 2 increase, 95% CI 1.00–1.04, p = 0.025). Controlling for these factors, we found an association between pre-infection FBG and the risk of severe COVID-19, with a differential effect in patients with and without a diagnosis of diabetes. For patients without diabetes, elevated FBG in the pre-diabetes range (106–125 mg/dl) was associated with severe COVID-19 (OR 1.55 95% CI 1.04–2.26 p = 0.027). For patients with a diagnosis of diabetes, we found a J-shaped association between pre-infection glucose control and the risk for severe COVID-19 where the lowest risk for was for patients with FBG 106–125 mg/dl; the risk increased with higher pre-infection glucose levels but strikingly also for patients with a low pre-infection FBG (&lt;100mg/dl) or HbA1C (&lt;5.7%). Conclusions and relevance Elevated pre-infection blood glucose is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 even in non-diabetics. For patients with a diagnosis of diabetes both high as well as low pre-infection glucose levels are risk factors for severe COVID-19. Further research is required to assess whether these associations are causal, but we believe these findings can already have clinical implications for COVID-19 risk assessment and stratification."
https://openalex.org/W3183291026,"One of the main reasons for the dynamic global economic development observed in recent years is the process of digitalization, referred to as Industry 4.0. The significance of digitalization for this development is appreciated by the EU-27. In order for these actions to be effective, it is necessary to diagnose the current level of digitalization in the EU-27countries. The article presents the results of the assessment of the level of digitalization of enterprises in the EU-27 countries. An empirical analysis was conducted using 16 determinants which describe the digitalization in a sample of 27 EU countries. Based on the adopted criteria and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution method, these countries were divided into four classes in terms of the level of digitalization. The analysis looked at the size of enterprises and was performed independently for small, medium and large enterprises. The adopted indicators allowed for the analysis of similarity between the EU-27 countries in terms of digitalization, using the Kohonen's networks. The result of this research was the division of the EU-27 countries into groups, also taking into account the size of studied enterprises. Due to the immensely diverse EU-27 economy, such a huge undertaking as the digital transformation process requires building logical internal ""digital coalitions"". The designated assessment and similarity between countries creates such opportunities, also in terms of building an effective policy to support these processes by the EU. This increases the chances of success of joint ventures and building a sustainable European community based on the latest technologies."

However, recent investigations have demonstrated that intratumoral fibrosis is important as a factor affecting the infiltration of TILs. This study investigated the organ specificities of TIL infiltration and intratumoral fibrosis in primary colorectal cancer and distant metastases, as well as the relationship between the distribution of TILs and intratumoral fibrosis.Patients who underwent resection of primary tumors or distant metastases for colorectal cancer with distant metastases were enrolled. We evaluated the TIL infiltration by immunohistochemical staining with CD3&CD8 and intratumoral fibrosis by immunohistochemical staining with α-SMA positive cancer-associated fibroblasts and Masson's trichrome staining against collagen fibers. The ""ImageJ"" was used to evaluate fibrosis, and the density of TILs in the dense and sparse areas of fibrosis was calculated. The Immunoscore (IS) was obtained based on the density of CD3+/CD8+TILs in the tumor center and invasive margin of the primary tumor.The degree of CD3+/CD8+TIL infiltration in peritoneal metastases was significantly lower than that in liver and lung metastases. The area ratio of α-SMA positive cancer-associated fibroblasts and collagen fibers in peritoneal metastases was significantly higher than that of liver and lung metastases. Furthermore, the density of TILs in the high-fibrosis area was significantly lower than that in the low-fibrosis area. In the high-IS group of primary tumors, the degree of TIL infiltration in distant metastases was significantly higher than that in the low-IS group.The infiltration of T lymphocytes into tumors is prevented in peritoneal metastases of colorectal cancer due to the high intratumoral fibrosis, which may lead to treatment resistance and a poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3186351623,"While establishing worldwide collective immunity with anti SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, COVID-19 remains a major health issue with dramatic ensuing economic consequences. In the transition, repurposing existing drugs remains the fastest cost-effective approach to alleviate the burden on health services, most particularly by reducing the incidence of the acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with severe COVID-19. We undertook a computational repurposing approach to identify candidate therapeutic drugs to control progression towards severe airways inflammation during COVID-19. Molecular profiling data were obtained from public sources regarding SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial or endothelial cells, immune dysregulations associated with severe COVID-19 and lung inflammation induced by other respiratory viruses. From these data, we generated a protein-protein interactome modeling the evolution of lung inflammation during COVID-19 from inception to an established cytokine release syndrome. This predictive model assembling severe COVID-19-related proteins supports a role for known contributors to the cytokine storm such as IL1β, IL6, TNFα, JAK2, but also less prominent actors such as IL17, IL23 and C5a. Importantly our analysis points out to alarmins such as TSLP, IL33, members of the S100 family and their receptors (ST2, RAGE) as targets of major therapeutic interest. By evaluating the network-based distances between severe COVID-19-related proteins and known drug targets, network computing identified drugs which could be repurposed to prevent or slow down progression towards severe airways inflammation. This analysis confirmed the interest of dexamethasone, JAK2 inhibitors, estrogens and further identified various drugs either available or in development interacting with the aforementioned targets. We most particularly recommend considering various inhibitors of alarmins or their receptors, currently receiving little attention in this indication, as candidate treatments for severe COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3184494586,"Collagen XVII (COL17), a cell-matrix adhesion protein, has been found to be suppressed in breast cancer. Our previous data demonstrated a preventive role of COL17 in breast cancer invasiveness. The present study used the stable COL17-overexpressing MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells to reveal an anti-proliferative effect of COL17 on breast cancer cell through mTOR deactivation. Cell proliferation was negatively correlated with the expression level of COL17 in a concentration-dependent manner in both conventional and three-dimensional (3D) culture systems. The correlation was confirmed by decreased expression of the proliferative marker Ki67 in COL17-expressing cells. In addition, overexpression of COL17 reduced the clonogenicity and growth of the cells. We demonstrated that COL17 affects the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by deactivation of AKT, mTOR and downstream effectors, particularly 4EBP1. Moreover, mice xenografted with high COL17-expressing cells exhibited delayed tumor progression and prolonged survival time. The high expression of COL17A1 gene encoding COL17 is associated with low-proliferation tumors, extended tumor-free period, and overall survival of breast cancer patients. In conclusion, our results revealed the novel function of COL17 using in vitro and in vivo models and elucidated the related pathway in breast cancer cell growth and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W3186347734,"The use of small ruminant milk for smoked cheese production makes it possible to incorporate valuable nutrients into the diet, especially as the consumption of unprocessed sheep or goat's milk is low compared to that from cows. Smoking of food not only prolongs its shelf-life but also improves its flavour. Taking the fact that many consumers do not accept some organoleptic properties of milk from small ruminants into account, the aim of the study was to assess and compare the organoleptic and nutritional properties of traditionally smoked cheeses made from goat, sheep and cow's milk. The analysed cheeses differed in terms of dry matter content and its components such as protein and fat. Their acidity was comparable, except for the sample made of raw goat's milk, which was characterised by a relatively high pH value (6.12 ± 0.06). The highest content of CLA (2.30 ± 0.04%), as well as the highest share of unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, was determined in the cheese made from sheep's milk. Moreover, the content of butyric and caproic free fatty acids in cheeses made from goat's milk was found to be several times higher than in the other analysed cheeses. The organoleptic assessment did not reveal any significant differences between the cheeses produced at small, private farms and in industrial conditions, or between different types of cheese, regardless of the type of milk from which they were produced."
https://openalex.org/W3185102350,"Institutional delivery has been considered as one of the important strategies to improve maternal and child health and significantly reduces birth-related complications. However, it is still low in developing countries though there are some improvements. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of institutional delivery and associated factors in the study area.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted. A multistage systematic sampling technique was used to select 1,394 study participants. We collected data from 18-48 years old women by using a structured questionnaire. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify factors at 95% confidence level.The mean age of respondents was 30 (±0.15). The wealth status of 33.48% respondents was poor and 33.33% rich. The prevalence of institutional delivery was 58.17% (95% CI: 55.57%, 60.77%). Multivariable logistic regression showed that demographic factors: women age (≥35years) (AOR = 1.43; 95% CI 1.04, 1.96), having a family size of less than five (AOR = 4.61; 95% CI 3.34, 6.34), having family discussion (AOR = 4.05; 95% CI 2.74, 5.97), distance from the nearby clinic (≤30min) (AOR = 2.92; 95% CI 1.53, 5.58) and decision power about place of delivery (AOR = 2.50; 95% CI 1.56, 4.01); socio-economic factors: husband's educational status of primary school (AOR = 1.64; 95% CI 1.19, 2.24), middle level household wealth index (AOR = 1.78; 95% CI 1.25, 2.54) and rich level household wealth index (AOR = 2.01; 95% CI 1.42, 2.86); and programmatic factors: antenatal care visit during their recent pregnancy (AOR = 1.86;95% CI 1.16, 2.97) were affects institutional delivery positively. Whereas bad behavior of health workers (AOR = 0.27; 95% CI 0.19, 0.39) negatively affects institutional delivery.Institutional delivery was low in the study area. This study implies that strengthening family discussion and up taking antenatal care services in regular ways are a few of the suggested recommendations."

Meanwhile, China is in a critical period of the transformation of apple industrial structure, and the improvement of apple production efficiency is an important way to increase farmers' output and income, moderate-scale operation is the inevitable trend in agricultural modernization. However, few studies have explored the production efficiency of the apple industry from the perspective of planting scale. In China, there are seven major apple-producing provinces: Shaanxi, Shandong, Gansu, Henan, Shanxi, Hebei, and Liaoning. Therefore, based on provincial panel data of the seven main apple-producing areas in China, this study used the Malmquist productivity index and data envelopment analysis to measure the efficiency level of the apple industry. At the same time, the threshold regression model was used to analyze the characteristics of the change in apple planting scale and production efficiency. The results showed that apple production efficiency in different regions of China exhibited regional differences and time series fluctuations. Apple planting scale had a ""double"" threshold effect, and the impact on apple production efficiency showed a ""negative effect-positive effect"" trend. Therefore, the suggestion is to appropriately adjust the scale of operation, take measures according to local conditions, promote the upgrading of apple production technology, and realize the integration of apple production and sales by using ""Internet +."""
https://openalex.org/W3184917010,"Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (DT-MREIT) is a newly developed technique that combines MR-based measurements of magnetic flux density with diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) data to reconstruct electrical conductivity tensor distributions. DT-MREIT techniques normally require injection of two independent current patterns for unique reconstruction of conductivity characteristics. In this paper, we demonstrate an algorithm that can be used to reconstruct the position dependent scale factor relating conductivity and diffusion tensors, using flux density data measured from only one current injection. We demonstrate how these images can also be used to reconstruct electric field and current density distributions. Reconstructions were performed using a mimetic algorithm and simulations of magnetic flux density from complementary electrode montages, combined with a small-scale machine learning approach. In a biological tissue phantom, we found that the method reduced relative errors between single-current and two-current DT-MREIT results to around 10%. For in vivo human experimental data the error was about 15%. These results suggest that incorporation of machine learning may make it easier to recover electrical conductivity tensors and electric field images during neuromodulation therapy without the need for multiple current administrations."
https://openalex.org/W3186677384,"Lipid management, especially with respect to triglyceride (TG) metabolism, in patients with diabetes is not sufficient with current therapeutic agents, and new approaches for improvement are needed. Members of the angiopoietin-like protein (ANGPTL) family, specifically ANGPTL3, 4, and 8, have been reported as factors that inhibit lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity and affect TGs. The present study investigated the association between lipid and glucose metabolism markers and the mechanism by which these proteins affect lipid metabolism. A total of 84 patients hospitalized for diabetes treatment were evaluated. Lipid and glucose metabolism markers in blood samples collected before breakfast, on the day after hospitalization, were analyzed. ANGPTL8 showed a significant positive correlation with TG values. HDL-C values displayed a significant positive correlation with ANGPTL3 but a negative correlation with ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8. The results did not indicate a significant correlation among ANGPTL3, 4, and 8 levels. Thus, it is possible that the distribution of these proteins differs among patients. When patients were divided into groups according to the levels of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8, those with high levels of both ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 also had high levels of TG and small dense LDL-C/LDL-C (%). Multiple regression analysis indicated that low LPL, high ApoC2, high ApoC3, high ApoE, and high ANGPTL8 levels were the determinants of fasting hypertriglyceridemia. By contrast, no clear association was observed between any of the ANGPTLs and glucose metabolism markers, but ANGPTL8 levels were positively correlated with the levels of HOMA2-IR and BMI. Patients with high levels of both ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 had the worst lipid profiles. Among ANGPTL3, 4, and 8, ANGPTL8 is more important as a factor determining plasma TG levels. We anticipate that the results of this research will facilitate potential treatments targeting ANGPTL8 in patients with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3184316256,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is endemic in Bangladesh and there are occasional outbreaks. The molecular characteristics and pathogenesis of endemic and outbreak HEV strains are poorly understood. We compared the genetic relatedness and virulence associated mutations of endemic HEV strains with outbreak strains.We analyzed systematically collected serum samples from HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) positive patients attended at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka from August 2013 to June 2015. HEV RNA positive samples were subjected to whole genome sequencing. Genotype and subtype of the strains were determined by phylogenetic analysis. Virulence associated mutations e.g. acute viral hepatitis (AVH), fulminant hepatic failure (FHF), chronic hepatitis, ribavirin treatment failure (RTF), B and T cell neutralization epitopes were determined.92 HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody positive plasma samples (43 in 2013-2014 and 49 in 2014-2015) were studied. 77.1% (70/92) of the samples were HEV RNA positive. A 279 bp open reading frame (ORF) 2 and ORF 3 sequence was obtained from 54.2% (38/70) of the strains. Of these 38 strains, whole genome sequence (WGS) was obtained from 21 strains. In phylogenetic analysis of 38 (279 bp) sequence all HEV sequences belonged to genotype 1 and subtype 1a. Further phylogenetic analysis of 21 HEV WGS, Bangladeshi HEV sequences clustered with genotype 1a sequences from neighboring countries. Within genotype 1a cluster, Bangladesh HEV strains formed a separate cluster with the 2010 HEV outbreak strains from northern Bangladesh. 80.9 to 100% of the strains had A317T, T735I, L1120I, L1110F, P259S, V1479I, G1634K mutations associates AVH, FHF and RTF. Mutations in T cell recognition epitope T3, T5, T7 was observed in 76.1%, 100% and 100% of the strains respectively.Strains of HEV genotype 1a are dominant in Bangladesh and are associated with endemic and outbreak of HEV infection. HEV isolates in Bangladesh have high prevalence of virulence associated mutations and mutation which alters antigenicity to B and T cell epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W3184415974,"Bee venom is a natural substance produced by worker bees. The aim of this research paper is to determine the characteristics of Anatolian bee venom by evaluating its chemical content and microbiological properties. Physical, chemical and microbiological analyses were performed on 25 bee venom samples from different areas of Anatolia, Turkey. Data obtained by 3-replicate studies were evaluated with normality and one-way and two-way ANOVA / Tukey tests. Chemical analyses of the bee venoms revealed average melittin, apamin, and phospholipase A2 contents of 40.57%, 2.12% and 13.67%, respectively. The results suggest that Anatolian bee venom has a high phospholipase A2 content compared to the previous literature. The results for apamin content were similar to those reported in other countries. Melittin content was within the range of standard values. Bee venom samples were also observed to have a high sugar content, associated with pollen and nectar contamination. Total aerobic mesophilic bacteria counts revealed no microbial development in 11 samples of bee venom. Staphylococcus aureus was not detected in any sample. A low microbial load was associated with a high phospholipase A2 content in the bee venom composition, thus contributing to its antimicrobial character. This study presents an examination of Anatolian bee venom in terms of chemical content and microbial quality. The examination of other components in addition to phospholipase A2, melittin and apamin in future studies, together with an analysis of antimicrobial properties will further our understanding of Anatolian bee venom."
https://openalex.org/W3184836231,"Although the most used measure of transformational leadership, the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ), has been the subject of intense scrutiny among leadership scholars, little interest has been shown in analyzing the relationship between its underlying constructs and / or their measures. The present study identifies a formative factor structure for most MLQ first-order factors, replacing the usual reflective model. We demonstrate the value of this structure using data from two different samples. First, we applied the MLQ to a sample of 129 police officers from the Catalan Police workforce. Second, we ran an online survey with 300 US citizens. We argue that three second-order factors (transformational, transactional, and laissez faire) should be used as emergent aggregate multidimensional models to describe three different leadership styles, challenging the ubiquitous multidimensional latent models favored in the extant literature. We then propose that transformational/charismatic leadership should be treated as a multidimensional emergent profile model, replacing the leadership development order of precedence, which is dominant in modern leadership research."
https://openalex.org/W3186921080,"Liver fibrosis screening in primary care population is a major public health issue. The FIB-4 index is a simple non-invasive fibrosis test combining age, transaminases, platelets count, developed for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the interest of liver fibrosis screening using systematic calculation of FIB-4 in routine blood analysis.Between December 2018 and May 2019, we conducted a prospective screening of liver fibrosis in 134 158 patients during a medical check-up including routine blood analysis. Among these patients, 29 707 had transaminases and platelets counts available and benefited from an automatic calculation of FIB-4. Results were obtained from 21 French clinical laboratories in the Bouches du Rhône region.Among the 29 707 patients, 2161 (7.3%) had a high risk of advanced fibrosis (FIB-4>2.67). Individual investigation of patients with FIB-4>2.67 allowed to screen 1268 (1268/2161: 58.7%) patients who were not managed for any liver disease.This work demonstrates the interest of FIB-4 for the screening of liver fibrosis in primary care population. Although additional clinical validation study is required to determine the utility and applicability of Fib-4 to daily practice, our study strongly supports this easy-to-implement strategy using a simple Fib-4 measure resulting from the use of available routine test results."
https://openalex.org/W3183279107,"Training Basic Life Support saves lives. However, current BLS training approaches are time-consuming and costly. Alternative cost-efficient and effective training methods are highly needed. The present study evaluated whether a video-feedback supported peer-guided Basic Life Support training approach achieves similar practical performance as a standard instructor-guided training in laypersons.In a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial, 288 first-year medical students were randomized to two study arms with different Basic Life Support training methods: 1) Standard Instructor Feedback (SIF) or 2) a Peer Video Feedback (PVF). Outcome parameters were objective data for Basic Life Support performance (compression depth and rate) from a resuscitation manikin with recording software as well as overall Basic Life Support performance and subjective confidence. Non-inferiority margins (Δ) for these outcome parameters and sample size calculation were based on previous studies with Standard Instructor Feedback. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals were employed to determine significance of non-inferiority.Results confirmed non-inferiority of Peer Video Feedback to Standard Instructor Feedback for compression depth (proportion difference PVF-SIF = 2.9%; 95% CI: -8.2% to 14.1%; Δ = -19%), overall Basic Life Support performance (proportion difference PVF-SIF = 6.7%; 95% CI: 0.0% to 14.3%; Δ = -27%) and subjective confidence for CPR performance (proportion difference PVF-SIF = -0.01; 95% CI: -0.18-0.17; Δ = -0.5) and emergency situations (proportion difference PVF-SIF = -0.02; 95% CI: -0.21-0.18; Δ = -0.5). Results for compression rate were inconclusive.Peer Video Feedback achieves comparable results as standard instructor-based training methods. It is an easy-to-apply and cost-efficient alternative to standard Basic Life Support training methods. To improve performance with respect to compression rate, additional implementation of a metronome is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3183485421,"In the Northern Rockies of the United States, predators like wolves (Canis lupus) and mountain lions (Puma concolor) have been implicated in fluctuations or declines in populations of game species like elk (Cervus canadensis) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). In particular, local distributions of these predators may affect ungulate behavior, use of space, and dynamics. Our goal was to develop generalizable predictions of habitat selection by wolves and mountain lions across western Montana. We hypothesized both predator species would select habitat that maximized their chances of encountering and killing ungulates and that minimized their chances of encountering humans. We assessed habitat selection by these predators during summer using within-home range (3rd order) resource selection functions (RSFs) in multiple study areas throughout western Montana, and tested how generalizable RSF predictions were by applying them to out-of-sample telemetry data from separate study areas. Selection for vegetation cover-types varied substantially among wolves in different study areas. Nonetheless, our predictions of 3rd order selection by wolves were highly generalizable across different study areas. Wolves consistently selected simple topography where ungulate prey may be more susceptible to their cursorial hunting mode. Topographic features may serve as better proxies of predation risk by wolves than vegetation cover-types. Predictions of mountain lion distribution were less generalizable. Use of rugged terrain by mountain lions varied across ecosystem-types, likely because mountain lions targeted the habitats of different prey species in each study area. Our findings suggest that features that facilitate the hunting mode of a predator (i.e. simple topography for cursorial predators and hiding cover for stalking predators) may be more generalizable predictors of their habitat selection than features associated with local prey densities."
https://openalex.org/W3183760325,"The primary aims of this study were to investigate if exposure to antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) was associated with lower rates of perinatal mortality (primary outcome) and other adverse perinatal outcomes (i.e., stillbirth, early neonatal mortality, APGAR score of < 7 at 5 mins, neonatal sepsis and respiratory distress syndrome) in preterm infants in hospitals in Tanzania. We also examine factors associated with administration of ACS among women at risk of preterm delivery.A hospital-based prospective chart review study was undertaken in four hospitals located in Nyamagana and Sengerema districts, Tanzania. The study population included all stillborn and live born preterm infants delivered between 24 to 34 weeks of gestation between July 2019 to February 2020. A total 1125 preterm infants were delivered by 1008 women (895 singletons, 230 multiple). Sociodemographic and medical data were recorded from participants' medical records.Three hundred and fifty-six (35.3%) women were administered at least one dose of ACS between 24 to 34 weeks' gestation and 385 (34.2%) infants were exposed to ACS. Infants exposed to ACS had a lower rate of perinatal mortality (13.77%) compared to those who were not exposed (28.38%). Multivariate analysis indicated that infants exposed to ACS were less likely to die during perinatal period, aRR 0.34 (95%CI 0.26-0.44). Only one-third of the sample was provided with ACS. Administration of ACS was associated with maternal education, attending antenatal care more than 3 times, method used to assess gestational age, maternal infection, exposure to maternal antibiotics, delivery mode and level of health facility.ACS significantly reduced the risk in perinatal mortality among infants born preterm in a limited resource setting. However, only about one-third of eligible women were provided with ACS, indicating low usage of ACS. Numerous factors were associated with low usage of ACS in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W3184057813,"Mitochondrial genomes of vascular plants are well known for their liability in architecture evolution. However, the evolutionary features of mitogenomes at intra-generic level are seldom studied in vascular plants, especially among gymnosperms. Here we present the complete mitogenome of Cycas debaoensis, an endemic cycad species to the Guangxi region in southern China. In addition to assemblage of draft mitochondrial genome, we test the conservation of gene content and mitogenomic stability by comparing it to the previously published mitogenome of Cycas taitungensis. Furthermore, we explored the factors such as structural rearrangements and nuclear surveillance of double-strand break repair (DSBR) proteins in Cycas in comparison to other vascular plant groups. The C. debaoensis mitogenome is 413,715 bp in size and encodes 69 unique genes, including 40 protein coding genes, 26 tRNAs, and 3 rRNA genes, similar to that of C. taitungensis. Cycas mitogenomes maintained the ancestral intron content of seed plants (26 introns), which is reduced in other lineages of gymnosperms, such as Ginkgo biloba, Taxus cuspidata and Welwitschia mirabilis due to selective pressure or retroprocessing events. C. debaoensis mitogenome holds 1,569 repeated sequences (> 50 bp), which partially account for fairly large intron size (1200 bp in average) of Cycas mitogenome. The comparison of RNA-editing sites revealed 267 shared non-silent editing site among predicted vs. empirically observed editing events. Another 33 silent editing sites from empirical data increase the total number of editing sites in Cycas debaoensis mitochondrial protein coding genes to 300. Our study revealed unexpected conserved evolution between the two Cycas species. Furthermore, we found strict collinearity of the gene order along with the identical set of genomic content in Cycas mt genomes. The stability of Cycas mt genomes is surprising despite the existence of large number of repeats. This structural stability may be related to the relative expansion of three DSBR protein families (i.e., RecA, OSB, and RecG) in Cycas nuclear genome, which inhibit the homologous recombinations, by monitoring the accuracy of mitochondrial chromosome repair."
https://openalex.org/W3185025625,"In this study, we describe an inexpensive and rapid method of using video analysis and identity tracking to measure the effects of tag weight on insect movement. In a laboratory experiment, we assessed the tag weight and associated context-dependent effects on movement, choosing temperature as a factor known to affect insect movement and behavior. We recorded the movements of groups of flightless adult crickets Gryllus locorojo (Orthoptera:Gryllidae) as affected by no tag (control); by light, medium, or heavy tags (198.7, 549.2, and 758.6 mg, respectively); and by low, intermediate, or high temperatures (19.5, 24.0, and 28.3°C, respectively). Each individual in each group was weighed before recording and was recorded for 3 consecutive days. The mean (± SD) tag mass expressed as a percentage of body mass before the first recording was 26.8 ± 3.7% with light tags, 72 ± 11.2% with medium tags, and 101.9 ± 13.5% with heavy tags. We found that the influence of tag weight strongly depended on temperature, and that the negative effects on movement generally increased with tag weight. At the low temperature, nearly all movement properties were negatively influenced. At the intermediate and high temperatures, the light and medium tags did not affect any of the movement properties. The continuous 3-day tag load reduced the average movement speed only for crickets with heavy tags. Based on our results, we recommend that researchers consider or investigate the possible effects of tags before conducting any experiment with tags in order to avoid obtaining biased results."

Expression of miR-210 and hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), and its responsive genes such as VEGF, TNF-α, IL-6, BCl2, Bax and Caspase 3 were analyzed by RT-PCR, Western blot and ELISA analyses. Results The HIF-1α expression decreased in DFU patients with increased miR-210 expression in both circulation and tissue biopsies. The circulatory IL-6 and inflammatory gene TNF-α expression was increased in DFU compared to healthy controls and T2DM subjects. Further, we found there was no alteration in the angiogenic marker, VEGF expression. In comparison, anti-apoptotic BCl2 was decreased and Bax and Caspase 3 was increased in DFU tissues relative to control. Conclusions The study showed that there was an inverse relationship between miR-210 and HIF-1α expression in patients with DFU, indicating that miR-210 may regulate the expression of the hypoxic gene."
https://openalex.org/W3186614140,"Fish muscle growth is a complex process regulated by multiple pathways, resulting on the net accumulation of proteins and the activation of myogenic progenitor cells. Around 350-320 million years ago, teleost fish went through a specific whole genome duplication (WGD) that expanded the existent gene repertoire. Duplicated genes can be retained by different molecular mechanisms such as subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization or redundancy, each one with different functional implications. While the great majority of ohnolog genes have been identified in the teleost genomes, the effect of gene duplication in the fish physiology is still not well characterized. In the present study we studied the effect of WGD on the transcription of the duplicated components controlling muscle growth. We compared the expression of lineage-specific ohnologs related to myogenesis and protein balance in the fast-skeletal muscle of pacus (Piaractus mesopotamicus-Ostariophysi) and Nile tilapias (Oreochromis niloticus-Acanthopterygii) fasted for 4 days and refed for 3 days. We studied the expression of 20 ohnologs and found that in the great majority of cases, duplicated genes had similar expression profiles in response to fasting and refeeding, indicating that their functions during growth have been conserved during the period after the WGD. Our results suggest that redundancy might play a more important role in the retention of ohnologs of regulatory pathways than initially thought. Also, comparison to non-duplicated orthologs showed that it might not be uncommon for the duplicated genes to gain or loss new regulatory elements simultaneously. Overall, several of duplicated ohnologs have similar transcription profiles in response to pro-growth signals suggesting that evolution tends to conserve ohnolog regulation during muscle development and that in the majority of ohnologs related to muscle growth their functions might be very similar."
https://openalex.org/W3183228028,"The significant resource investment in research on ecosystems for development of the Global South does not necessarily result in high levels of research knowledge utilisation (RKU). Understanding the factors associated with various levels of RKU can inform funding agencies and researchers developing new projects. We applied a combination of a questionnaire survey and follow up interviews with members of research teams of multiple, broadly comparable projects to make an assessment of achieved RKU levels using a combination of quantitative statistical hypothesis testing and narrative description of survey responses. Research knowledge dissemination by members of the project team who work for non-academic institutions or champions, e.g. particularly motivated people that promote and facilitate implementation or adoption of the project results, and via television was associated with higher research knowledge utilization. By contrast, dissemination by members of the project team working for academic institutions and via peer-reviewed journals was associated with lower RKU. The achieved level of RKU was consistently lower than the targeted level of RKU across spatial scales. The discrepancy between the perceived level of RKU and the evidence provided by survey respondents indicates the need for better monitoring the utilisation of research knowledge in development pathways. Our results further suggest that three years project duration is too short to achieve high levels of RKU in socio-ecological systems. We recommend involvement of non-academic members of the project team in project design, leadership and dissemination for increasing RKU."
https://openalex.org/W3183229138,"Background Interprofessional education (IPE) is crucial in dentistry, medicine, and nursing. However, scant mixed methods studies have compared the IPE outcomes across these disciplines to develop evidence-based IPE. This study explored the differences in the readiness of dental, medical, and nursing students for interprofessional learning before and after IPE workshops and elucidated reasons for this disparity. Methods Data were obtained from dental, medical, and nursing students who participated in IPE workshops conducted at Tokyo Medical and Dental University in Japan in 2019 and 2020. The participants filled the validated Japanese version of the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) before and after attending the workshops (n = 378). Paired t-tests were performed to assess differences between the pre- and post- workshop RIPLS scores. Welch’s t-tests were deployed to evaluate interdisciplinary differences in their scores. Qualitative analyses were conducted using an explanatory sequential design with focus group discussions (FGDs) held with 17 dental students to explain the quantitative results. Results Total RIPLS scores increased significantly for every discipline after the workshops ( p &lt; 0.001). Dental students scored significantly lower pre- and post- workshop aggregates than medical and nursing students, respectively ( p &lt; 0.001). The FGDs yielded three principal themes in the explanations tendered by dental students on their lower scores: 1) dental students rarely felt the need for interprofessional collaborations, 2) dentists often worked without the need for interprofessional collaborations, and 3) dental students believed their contribution to the workshop was insufficient. Conclusions The results revealed divergences in the readiness of dental, medical, and nursing students for interprofessional learning, and the study illuminated possible reasons for these disparities. These outcomes will help develop evidence-based IPE by indicating approaches to place a higher value on interprofessional collaborations in educational environments, ameliorate the awareness of educators, and enhance the workshop facilitation style."
https://openalex.org/W3184299348,"Several species of Fusarium cause serious diseases in date palm worldwide. In the present work, 14 SSR markers were used to assess the genetic variation of Fusarium strains isolated from diseased trees in Saudi Arabia. We also studied the effect of different temperatures on mycelial growth of these strains. The pathogenicity of four strains of F. proliferatum was also evaluated on local date palm cultivars. Eleven SSR markers amplified a total of 57 scorable alleles from Fusarium strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that F. proliferatum strains grouped in one clade with 95% bootstrap value. Within F. proliferatum clade, 14 SSR genotypes were identified, 9 of them were singleton. Four out of the five multi-individual SSR genotypes contained strains isolated from more than one location. Most F. solani strains grouped in one clade with 95% bootstrap value. Overall, the SSR markers previously developed for F. verticillioides and F. oxysporum were very useful in assessing the genetic diversity and confirming the identity of Saudi Fusarium strains. The results from the temperature study showed significant differences in mycelial growth of Fusarium strains at different temperatures tested. The highest average radial growth for Fusarium strains was observed at 25°C, irrespective of species. The four F. proliferatum strains showed significant differences in their pathogenicity on date palm cultivars. It is anticipated that the assessment of genetic diversity, effect of temperature on hyphal growth and pathogenicity of potent pathogenic Fusarium strains recovered from date palm-growing locations in Saudi Arabia can help in effectively controlling these pathogens."

Diagnoses were defined using the International Classification of Diseases codes, 9th revision. Adjusted hazard ratios for outcomes were calculated using Cox regression analysis and adjusted for the following variables: BTA injection, sex, age, severities of CP, comorbidities, location, urbanization level, and level of care.A total of 1,405 CP children (670 female vs. 735 male), 281 in the BTA group and 1,124 in the controls, were followed-up for a mean of 5 years 4 months. There were no significant differences in the outcomes in both groups, in the incidence rates of hip dislocation and scoliosis, nor in the surgical rates for hip and spine surgery. Mortality rate in the BTA group was 0.49 times lower than that in the controls (p = 0.001). Moderate to severe types of CP had higher incidence rates of hip dislocation, scoliosis, hip surgery, spine surgery, and mortality.Moderate to severe types of CP had poorer outcomes in all aspects, including a higher risk of hip dislocation, scoliosis, surgical rate for hip and spine, and mortality. Although BTA injection in children with CP proved to not significantly reduce hip dislocation and scoliosis, it is considered safe as an anti-spasticity treatment and may be beneficial for survival."
https://openalex.org/W3184406024,"Chronic infections are often connected to biofilm formation. In presence of implants, this can lead to loss of the implant. Systemic or local application of drugs is relatively ineffective in case of biofilm formation. One technique to provide antibacterial properties on demand is the antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). Using this technique, these properties can be ""switched on"" by light illumination. In the middle ear with the semitransparent tympanic membrane, it might be possible in future to activate the antibacterial effect without opening the membrane. Therefore, we investigated the optical absorbance spectra of the tympanic membrane. Optical absorbance spectra were measured in ex vivo preparations from neonatal and adult rats with the membrane still being attached to the surrounding bony ring and four human samples. After performing area scans, the spot with the lowest absorbance being surrounded by a ring like structure with higher absorbance was chosen as region of interest for scanning wavelengths between 300 and 900 nm. Absorbance is generally higher at lower wavelengths with a local absorbance maximum at 420 nm and a weak second maximum with two neighbouring peaks at 540 / 580 nm and is significantly higher in adult rats compared to neonatal rats where about 10% of light was transmitted. The human samples show similar characteristics with a little higher absorbance. For activation of aPDT through the tympanic membrane, larger wavelengths are more promising. Whether the amount of light transmitted through the membrane would be sufficient to induce aPDT remains to be tested in further experiments."
https://openalex.org/W3184429208,"The geographical variation of maternal dietary patterns related to birth outcomes is important for improving the health of mothers and children; however, it is currently unknown. Thus, the objective of the study was to investigate geographical variations of maternal dietary pattern during pregnancy, and evaluate the spatial varying association of maternal dietary patterns in pregnancy with abnormal birth weight. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Shaanxi province in Northwest China in 2013 to evaluate the relationship between abnormal birth weight and dietary pattern using the Geographically Weighted Logistic Regression (GWLR). Three dietary patterns during pregnancy were extracted through factor analysis, explaining approximately 45.8% of the variability of food intake. Approximately 81.6% of mothers with higher scores on the equilibrium pattern was more unlikely to have small for gestational age (SGA) infants, with the lower OR observed in Central and South Shaanxi. The snacks pattern was positively associated with low birth weight (LBW) for 23.2% of participants, with the highest OR in Central Shaanxi. Among about 80.0% of participants with higher scores on the snacks pattern living in South and Central Shaanxi, there was a higher risk for SGA. The OR values tend to descend from South to North Shaanxi. The OR values of the negative association between prudent pattern and LBW decreased from South to North Shaanxi among approximately 59.3% of participants. The prudent pattern was also negatively associated with the increasing risk of fetal macrosomia among 19.2% of participants living mainly in South Shaanxi. The association of maternal dietary patterns during pregnancy with abnormal birth weight varied geographically across Shaanxi province. The findings emphasize the importance of geographical distribution to improve the dietary patterns among disadvantaged pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W3185228120,"Resistance training (RT) is a promising strategy to slow or prevent fluid cognitive decline during aging. However, the effects of strength-specific RT programs have received little attention. The purpose of this single-group proof of concept clinical trial was to determine whether a 12-week strength training (ST) program could improve fluid cognition in healthy older adults 60 to 80 years of age, and to explore concomitant physiological and psychological changes.Twenty participants (69.1 ± 5.8 years, 14 women) completed this study with no drop-outs or severe adverse events. Baseline assessments were completed before an initial 12-week control period, then participants were re-tested at pre-intervention and after the 12-week ST intervention. The NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery and standard physical and psychological measures were administered at all three time points. During the 36 sessions of periodized ST (3 sessions per week), participants were supervised by an exercise specialist and challenged via autoregulatory load progression.Test-retest reliability over the control period was good for fluid cognition and excellent for crystallized cognition. Fluid composite scores significantly increased from pre- to post-intervention (8.2 ± 6.1%, p < 0.01, d = 1.27), while crystallized composite scores did not (-0.5 ± 2.8%, p = 0.46, d = -0.34). Performance on individual fluid instruments, including executive function, attention, working memory, and processing speed, also significantly improved. Surprisingly, changes in fluid composite scores had small negative correlations with changes in muscular strength and sleep quality, but a small positive correlation with changes in muscular power.Thus, improvements in fluid cognition can be safely achieved in older adults using a 12-week high-intensity ST program, but further controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings. Furthermore, the relationship with other widespread physiological and psychological benefits remains unclear."
https://openalex.org/W3185719789,"Stress exposure during perinatal period may lead to maternal cortisol increase that negatively affects the offspring development. In recent years, the interest on non-invasive sampling methods to measure cortisol as a marker of stress is increasing in both humans and animals. Indeed, discomfort due to blood collection may compromise the diagnostic outcome, mainly in uncooperative patients. So far, some alternative matrices but not milk have been explored in adult dogs, while no data are available on the neonate and paediatric live pups. This study aimed to measure cortisol concentration in different biological substrates in both dams (blood, saliva, hair and milk) and pups (saliva and hair) at established times from proestrus up to two months after parturition. For this purpose, five female German shepherd bitches and their 22 pups were enrolled. Cortisol concentration was assessed using the enzyme immunoassay kit (Salivary Cortisol ELISA kit, Salimetrics) after matrices appropriate preparation if required. Cortisol was measurable in all the substrates, except some milk samples below the detection limit. Maternal cortisol concentrations differed among the matrices (P <0.0001) with the highest values recorded in plasma (median 0.596 μg/dL) compared to saliva (median 0.159 μg/dL), hair (median 0.083 μg/dL) and milk (median 0.045 μg/dL). Cortisol in dams did not vary within the same matrix over time. In pups, salivary (median 0.295 μg/dL) cortisol was always higher than hair (median 0.049 μg/dL; P <0.0001). At birth (P = 0.01) and two months later (P = 0.05), neonatal salivary cortisol was higher compared to other samplings. The present study demonstrates the suitability of these innovative substrates for cortisol measurement, suggesting them as potential diagnostic support in canine neonatology and welfare."
https://openalex.org/W3185765193,"The spatial patterns of plant species reflect the competitive pressures on individuals. To generate Competition indices (CI), we measured the diameter at breast height (DBH), crown volumes (CV) and the distances between trees. In this study, Abies kawakamii were divided based on the dominant component of the understory (moss or bamboo) to (1) investigate the relationship between the CI and stand structural attributes (SSAs); (2) compare the inter- and intraspecies; CIs as well as living and dead individual CIs; and (3) examine the relationship between the DBH and CI. The current findings indicate that the understory composition affected the CI and SSAs. The interspecies CI was larger than the intraspecies CI when bamboo-dominated the understory. In contrast, the intraspecies CI was larger than the interspecies CI when the understory was dominated by moss. The CI of dead individuals was higher than that of live individuals due to the biological characteristics and regeneration needs of Abies. Additionally, sensitivity to the environment and available resources may exert more pressure on young individuals than mature individuals."

This study aimed to investigate the critical explanatory variables controlling total Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, Mg, Pb, and Zn variations in the arable topsoil using classical statistics, principal component analysis, and random forest techniques. The work was conducted in the core region of the Three Gorges Reservoir of China. The explanatory variables included soil, topography, climate, vegetation, land use type, and distance-related parameters. Average concentrations of the metal elements were in order of Fe > Mg > Ca > Mn > Zn > Cr > Ni > Pb > Cu > Cd. Soil Cr, Fe, and Pb showed low variability while others presented medium variability. Average concentrations of Cr, Fe, Cd, and Mg exceeded their corresponding background values. There were highly positive correlations between all metal elements except Pb, Cd and Cr. The principal component analysis further demonstrated that the sources of Pb, Cd, and Cr differed with other elements. The results of random forest suggested that soil properties followed by topography were critical parameters affecting the variations of Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, and Cu. Agricultural activities and soil properties were major factors controlling the variations of Pb, Cr, and Cd. Further study should be conducted to understand the relations between the metal elements and soil properties."
https://openalex.org/W3186514684,"A model of myocardial electromechanics is suggested. It combines modified and simplified versions of previously published models of cardiac electrophysiology, excitation-contraction coupling, and mechanics. The mechano-calcium and mechano-electrical feedbacks, including the strain-dependence of the propagation velocity of the action potential, are also accounted for. The model reproduces changes in the twitch amplitude and Ca2+-transients upon changes in muscle strain including the slow response. The model also reproduces the Bowditch effect and changes in the twitch amplitude and duration upon changes in the interstimulus interval, including accelerated relaxation at high stimulation frequency. Special efforts were taken to reduce the stiffness of the differential equations of the model. As a result, the equations can be integrated numerically with a relatively high time step making the model suitable for multiscale simulation of the human heart and allowing one to study the impact of myocardial mechanics on arrhythmias."
https://openalex.org/W3183214441,"As young football players develop important technical and tactical skills during competitive matches, this study investigated quantity and quality of technical and tactical actions in real game conditions in a 4v4 compared to the traditional 7v7 match format. In total, three matches of each format were played by 103 young football players (10.3±0.6 years) and video monitored for subsequent manual tagging of technical and tactical events. Based on the number of technical and tactical actions in the 7v7 matches, players were classified as dominant or non-dominant and changes in these subgroups were assessed during the 4v4 match format. The 4v4 match format significantly (P<0.001) increased total number of actions per player per minute compared to the 7v7 matches (5.59±1.44 and 2.78±0.73, respectively) and the number of successful (2.88±0.92 and 1.15±0.49, respectively) and unsuccessful (1.05±0.42 and 0.67±0.23, respectively) actions. Both dominant and non-dominant players increased their number of actions during the 4v4 compared to 7v7 match format. Despite a missing significant interaction effect, there was a larger percentage increase in number of actions for the non-dominant players (143%) compared to dominant players (72%) in 4v4. The 4v4 match format shows twice as many technical and tactical actions in real game conditions and, therefore, may improve players' skill development."

The aim of this study was to investigate the phenomenological characteristics of mental representations and inner experiences of autistic individuals. A total of 39 autistic adults and 80 control adults answered an online questionnaire. Autistic participants reported a more frequent use of visual mental representations than controls for different types of everyday situations. Moreover, autistic individuals defined their visual mental representations as more detailed than control participants. Furthermore, when describing their inner experiences, autistic participants used perceptive visual themes whereas control participants relied more on the description of events and memories. Our results support the hypothesis that some autistic individuals indeed ""think in pictures"". We discuss the impact of such a visual way of thinking in daily life."
https://openalex.org/W3184367125,"Most chemical reactions promoted by light and using a photosensitizer (a dye) are subject to the phenomenon of luminescence. Redistribution of light in all directions (isotropic luminescence emission) and in a new spectral range (luminescence emission spectrum) makes experimental and theoretical studies much more complex compared to a situation with a purely absorbing reaction volume. This has a significant impact on the engineering of photoreactors for industrial applications. Future developments associated with photoreactive system optimization are therefore extremely challenging, and require an in-depth description and quantitative analysis of luminescence. In this study, a radiative model describing the effect of luminescence radiation on the calculation of absorptance is presented and analyzed with the multiple inelastic-scattering approach, using Monte Carlo simulations. The formalism of successive orders of scattering expansion is used as a sophisticated analysis tool which provides, when combined with relevant physical approximations, convenient analytical approximate solutions. Its application to four photosensitizers that are representative of renewable hydrogen production via artificial photosynthesis indicates that luminescence has a significant impact on absorptance and on overall quantum yield estimation, with the contribution of multiple scattering and important spectral effects due to inelastic scattering. We show that luminescence cannot be totally neglected in that case, since photon absorption lies at the root of the chemical reaction. We propose two coupled simple and appropriate analytical approximations enabling the estimation of absorptance with a relative error below 6% in every tested situation: the zero-order scattering approximation and the gray single-scattering approximation. Finally, this theoretical approach is used to determine and discuss the overall quantum yield of a bio-inspired photoreactive system with Eosin Y as a photosensitizer, implemented in an experimental setup comprising a photoreactor dedicated to hydrogen production."

We retrospectively evaluated the vascular access procedures for intravenous chemotherapy in breast cancer patients from 2016 to 2018. A total of 300 consecutive patients were included, 100 each who received peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), arm ports, and chest ports. When selecting a catheter, a PICC was considered when four cycles of chemotherapy were expected. Otherwise, patient preference was considered. All but one patient with an arm port were women, with mean age of 51.7 ± 9.1 years. The total mean complication-free catheter indwelling time was 1357.6 days for chest ports, 997.8 days for arm ports, and 366.8 days for PICCs (p = 0.004). There were 11 catheter-related complications (3.7%), one in a chest port patient, five in arm port patients, and eight in PICC patients. There was no patient with catheter related blood stream infection or deep vein thrombosis. All three types of catheters could be used in breast cancer patients without causing serious complications. The selection of catheter considering the clinical situation was effective for providing a safe and secure chemotherapy delivery route."

Despite reports indicating the suitability of CUSA-derived material for diagnosis and research, its use is still marginal. We extended these conclusions to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, the most common format for archival tumour tissue in anatomical pathology departments, by conducting for the first time RNA-seq analysis in CUSA aspirates. We compared the molecular diagnosis of somatic mutations used in the clinical routine and the gene expression profiles of fixed solid material from CUSA aspirates and TCRs from the same patients in selected gliomas encompassing grades II to IV. Despite the characteristic heterogeneity of gliomas, we found substantial similarities between the corresponding aspirates and TCRs that included transcriptional signatures associated with glioma subtypes. Based on these results, we confirmed that CUSA-fixed biomaterials from glioma surgeries are appropriate for downstream applications and biomarkers screening."
https://openalex.org/W3185874223,"Insect metamorphosis into an adult occurs after the juvenile hormone (JH) titer decreases at the end of the juvenile stage. This generally coincides with decreased transcript levels of JH-response transcription factors Krüppel homolog 1 ( Kr-h1 ) and broad ( br ), and increased transcript levels of the adult specifier E93 . Thrips (Thysanoptera) develop through inactive and non-feeding stages referred to as “propupa” and “pupa”, and this type of distinctive metamorphosis is called neometaboly. To understand the mechanisms of hormonal regulation in thrips metamorphosis, we previously analyzed the transcript levels of Kr-h1 and br in two thrips species, Frankliniella occidentalis (Thripidae) and Haplothrips brevitubus (Phlaeothripidae). In both species, the transcript levels of Kr-h1 and br decreased in the “propupal” and “pupal” stages, and their transcription was upregulated by exogenous JH mimic treatment. Here we analyzed the developmental profiles of E93 in these two thrips species. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that E93 expression started to increase at the end of the larval stage in F . occidentalis and in the “propupal” stage of H . brevitubus , as Kr-h1 and br mRNA levels decreased. Treatment with an exogenous JH mimic at the onset of metamorphosis prevented pupal-adult transition and caused repression of E93 . These results indicated that E93 is involved in adult differentiation after JH titer decreases at the end of the larval stage of thrips. By comparing the expression profiles of Kr-h1 , br , and E93 among insect species, we propose that the “propupal” and “pupal” stages of thrips have some similarities with the holometabolous prepupal and pupal stages, respectively."

The use of cryopreserved vascular allografts could be a feasible therapeutic option, but the optimal conditions for their production and use are not precisely defined.To evaluate the effects of cryopreservation and the duration of storage on the thrombogenicity of femoral artery allografts.In our prospective study, eleven multi-organ-donation-harvested human femoral arteries were examined at five time points during storage at -80°C: before cryopreservation as a fresh native sample and immediately, one, twelve and twenty-four weeks after the cryopreservation. Cross-sections of allografts were perfused with heparin-anticoagulated blood at shear-rates relevant to medium-sized arteries. The deposited platelets and fibrin were immunostained. The thrombogenicity of the intima, media and adventitia layers of the artery grafts was assessed quantitatively from the relative area covered by fibrin- and platelet-related fluorescent signal in the confocal micrographs.Regression analysis of the fibrin and platelet coverage in the course of the 24-week storage excluded the possibility for increase in the graft thrombogenicity in the course of time and supported the hypothesis for a descending trend in fibrin generation and platelet deposition on the arterial wall. The fibrin deposition in the cryopreserved samples did not exceed the level detected in any of the three layers of the native graft. However, an early (up to week 12) shift above the native sample level was observed in the platelet adhesion to the media.The hemostatic potential of cryopreserved arterial allografts was retained, whereas their thrombogenic potential declined during the 6-month storage. The only transient prothrombotic change was observed in the media layer, where the platelet deposition exceeded that of the fresh native grafts in the initial twelve weeks after cryopreservation, suggesting a potential clinical benefit from antiplatelet therapy in this time-window."

This study explores the online visibility and activities of all (478) mosques in the Netherlands. We collected data on personal websites and four social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube). The majority of mosques have a website (52%) and an account on Facebook (61%). Less often used are Twitter (17%), Instagram (17%) and YouTube (19%). On social media platforms, mosques strongly differ in their activity and number of followers. We find evidence to suggest that Salafist mosques, which tend to have a strict ideology, are more active on Twitter and YouTube, and also attract a larger share of followers on Facebook than non-Salafist mosques. Our more fine-grained analysis on Twitter shows that Salafist mosques in the Netherlands cluster together. Followers of Salafist mosques make up a community of users who are mainly connected to each other (""bonding ties""), and much less so to other users (""bridging ties""). We conclude with a discussion of opportunities for studying the online presence and activities of mosques and Muslims in western societies."

Trichoderma spp., one of the widespread biocontrol fungi, can promote plant growth and induce plant disease resistance. To investigate milRNAs potentially involved in the interaction between Trichoderma and tomato roots, a small RNA (sRNA) library expressed during the interaction of T. asperellum DQ-1 and tomato roots was constructed and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeqTM 2500 sequencing platform. From 13,464,142 sRNA reads, we identified 21 milRNA candidates that were similar to other known microRNAs in the miRBase database and 22 novel milRNA candidates that possessed a stable microRNA precursor hairpin structure. Among them, three milRNA candidates showed different expression level in the interaction according to the result of stem-loop RT-PCR indicating that these milRNAs may play a distinct regulatory role in the interaction between Trichoderma and tomato roots. The potential transboundary milRNAs from T. asperellum and their target genes in tomato were predicted by bioinformatics analysis. The results revealed that several interesting proteins involved in plant growth and development, disease resistance, seed maturation, and osmotic stress signal transduction might be regulated by the transboundary milRNAs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of milRNAs taking part in the process of interaction of T. asperellum and tomato roots and associated with plant promotion and disease resistance. The results might be useful to unravel the mechanism of interaction between Trichoderma and tomato."

Its touchless identification process and non-compulsory rule to users are irreplaceable by other approaches, such as iris recognition or fingerprint recognition. Among all face recognition techniques, principal component analysis (PCA), proposed in the earliest stage, still attracts researchers because of its property of reducing data dimensionality without losing important information. Nevertheless, establishing a PCA-based face recognition system is still time-consuming, since there are different problems that need to be considered in practical applications, such as illumination, facial expression, or shooting angle. Furthermore, it still costs a lot of effort for software developers to integrate toolkit implementations in applications. This paper provides a software framework for PCA-based face recognition aimed at assisting software developers to customize their applications efficiently. The framework describes the complete process of PCA-based face recognition, and in each step, multiple variations are offered for different requirements. Some of the variations in the same step can work collaboratively and some steps can be omitted in specific situations; thus, the total number of variations exceeds 150. The implementation of all approaches presented in the framework is provided."
https://openalex.org/W3185384686,"Grassy biomes such as savannas are maintained by an interacting suite of ecosystem processes from herbivory to rainfall to fire. Many studies have examined the impacts of large mammalian herbivores on herbaceous plant communities, but few of these studies have been conducted in humid, fertile savannas. We present the findings of a short-term experiment that investigated the effects of herbivory in a fertile, humid, and semi-managed savanna. We erected large-herbivore exclosures in Alas Purwo National Park, Java, Indonesia where rainfall is high and fire is suppressed to test how herbivores impact plant community development across the growing season. Where large mammalian herbivores were excluded, herbaceous plant communities contained more non-grasses and were less similar; diverging in their composition as the growing season progressed. Effects of herbivore exclusion on plant species richness, evenness, and biomass per quadrat were generally weak. Notably, however, two weedy plant species (one native, Imperata cylindrica and one introduced, Senna cf. tora) appeared to benefit most from herbivore release. Our results suggest that heavy grazing pressure by native large mammalian herbivores controlled the composition of the herbaceous plant community. Moreover, exclusion of large mammalian herbivores led to divergence in the plant species composition of exclosures; compositional dissimilarity between herbivore-exclusion plots was higher than between plots exposed to large mammalian herbivores. Our findings suggest that, at this high-rainfall site, large mammalian herbivores constrained the developmental trajectory of plant communities across the growing season."
https://openalex.org/W3183256782,"This study aimed to determine the prevalence of vertebral fractures (VF) in a selected urban population in Malaysia and to explore possible variables associated with VF in the study population.A cross-sectional study involving community-living, healthy subjects aged between 45-90 years from the state of Selangor, Malaysia, were invited to attend a bone health check-up. Subjects with diseases known to affect bone metabolism or were on treatment for osteoporosis (OP) were excluded. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Lateral and antero-posterior view lumbar spine x-rays were performed and VF was determined by the semi-quantitative Genant method.A total of 386 subjects were studied. Asymptomatic morphometric VF were found in 44 (11.4%) subjects. T12 was the most common vertebrae to be fractured. The prevalence of VF was significantly higher in menopausal women (12.4%) compared to non-menopausal women, in those above the age of 60 (18.5%), in those of Chinese ethnicity (16.5%), in those with a low body fat percentage (17.1%) and among those with OP (27.0%). The mean (standard deviation) 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels were significantly higher in those with VF compared to those without VF, 67.64 (23.50) and 57.47 (21.71) nmol/L, respectively. However, after multiple regression analysis, age over 60 years and OP on DXA BMD measurement were the only significant associated factors for VF.Overall, 11.4% of a selected Malaysian urban population had asymptomatic morphometric VF. Age over 60 years and OP on DXA BMD measurement, but not 25(OH)D levels, were associated with VF."

From 212,481 ACS-EC, 42,670 (20.1%) had more than one hospitalization. ACS-EC hospitalization rates decreased throughout the study period (2000: 207.7/100.000 person-years to 2015: 185,8/100,000 person-years, p for trend <0.05). Proportion of IHT increased from 10.5% in 2000 to 20.1% in 2015 compared to a reduction in both planned and unplanned 30-day ACS rehospitalization from 9.0% in 2000 to 2.7% in 2015. After adjusting for patient and first admission hospital's characteristics, compared to 2000-2003, in 2012-2015 the odds of IHT increased by 3.81 (95%CI: 3.65-3.98); the odds of unplanned and planned 30-day ACS rehospitalization decreased by 0.36 (95%CI: 0.33; 0.39) and 0.47 (95%CI: 0.43; 0.53), respectively. Female sex, older age and the presence and severity of comorbidities were associated with lower likelihood of being transferred or having a planned 30-day ACS rehospitalization. Unplanned 30-day ACS rehospitalization was more likely in patients with higher comorbidity burden.IHT and 30-day ACS rehospitalization reflect coronary referral network efficiency and access to specialized treatment. Identifying factors associated with higher likelihood of IHT and 30-day ACS rehospitalization may allow heightened surveillance and interventions to reduce rehospitalizations and inequities in access to specialized treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3184393522,"This paper contributes to the debate on race- and gender-based discrimination in grading. We apply a quasi-experimental research design exploiting a shift from open grading in 2018 (examinee's name clearly visible on written assignments), to blind grading in 2019 (only student ID number visible). The analysis thus informs name-based stereotyping and discrimination, where student ethnicity and gender are derived from their names on written assignments. The case is a quantitative methods exam at Roskilde University (Denmark). We rely on OLS regression models with interaction terms to analyze whether blind grading has any impact on the relative grading differences between the sexes (female vs. male examinees) and/or between the two core ethnic groups (ethnic minorities vs. ethnic majority examinees). The results show no evidence of gender or ethnic bias based on names in the grading process. The results were validated by several checks for robustness. We argue that the weaker evidence of ethnic discrimination in grading vis-à-vis discrimination in employment and housing suggests the relevance of gauging the stakes involved in potentially discriminatory activities."
https://openalex.org/W3185672563,"Compliant surfaces beneath a casualty diminish the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in clinical environments. To examine this issue in a sporting environment, we assessed chest compression quality and rescuer exertion upon compliant sports safety matting.Twenty-seven advanced life support providers volunteered (13 male/14 female; mass = 79.0 ± 12.5 kg; stature = 1.77 ± 0.09 m). Participants performed 5 × 2 min, randomized bouts of continuous chest compressions on a mannequin, upon five surfaces: solid floor; low-compliance matting; low-compliance matting with a backboard; high-compliance matting; high-compliance matting with a backboard. Measures included chest compression depth and rate, percentage of adequate compressions, and rescuer heart rate and perceived exertion.Chest compression depth and rate were significantly lower upon high-compliance matting relative to other surfaces (p<0.05). The percentage of adequate compressions (depth ≥50 mm) was lowest upon high-compliance matting (40 ± 39%) versus low-compliance matting (60 ± 36%) and low-compliance matting with a backboard (59 ± 39%). Perceived exertion was significantly greater upon high-compliance matting versus floor, low-compliance matting, and low-compliance matting with a backboard (p<0.05).Providers of CPR should be alerted to the detrimental effects of compliant safety matting in a sporting environment and prepare to alter the targeted compression depth and rescuer rotation intervals accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W3185879386,"Musculoskeletal injuries, a public health priority also in the military context, are ascribed to several risk factors, including: increased reaction forces; low/reduced muscle strength, endurance, body mass, Vitamin D level, and bone density; inadequate lifestyles and environment. The MOVIDA Project-funded by the Italian Ministry of Defence-aims at developing a transportable toolkit (assessment instrumentation, assessment protocols and reference/risk thresholds) which integrates motor function assessment with biological, environmental and behavioural factors to help characterizing the risk of stress fracture, stress injury or muscle fatigue due to mechanical overload. The MOVIDA study has been designed following the STROBE guidelines for observational cross-sectional studies addressing healthy adults, both militaries and civilians, with varying levels of physical fitness (sedentary people, recreational athletes, and competitive athletes). The protocol of the study has been designed and validated and is hereby reported. It allows to collect and analyse anamnestic, diagnostic and lifestyle-related data, environmental parameters, and functional parameters measured through portable and wearable instrumentation during adapted 6 minutes walking test. The t-test, one and two-way ANOVA with post-hoc corrections, and ANCOVA tests will be used to investigate relevant differences among the groups with respect to biomechanical parameters; non-parametric statistics will be rather used for non-normal continuous variables and for quantitative discrete variables. Generalized linear models will be used to account for risk and confounding factors."
https://openalex.org/W3186135344,"The severity of major depressive disorder (MDD), which is related to the depressive symptoms, is a predictor of clinical outcomes and may be used to determine the appropriate treatment. However, there is a lack of systematic research on the relationship between early depressive symptoms and MDD severity. This study aimed to clarify the association between initial depressive symptoms and MDD severity in working patients. We assessed 118 patients aged over 20 years who visited the Neuropsychiatry Department of the Osaka City University Hospital following their first episode of MDD. Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between age, gender, marital status, working hours, and initial self-perceived depressive symptoms and MDD severity. Age and working hours were analyzed as continuous variables, and gender (man, woman), marital status (married, single) and severity (mild to moderate MDD, severe to very severe MDD) were analyzed as categorical variables. The most common initial self-perceived symptom was “depressed mood,” followed by “fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.” The univariate analysis found no association between age, gender, marital status, or working hours and MDD severity. Initial self-perceived non-somatic symptoms were associated with increased odds of having severe MDD (odds ratio = 3.32, 95% confidence interval 1.46–7.58), and this association persisted in the adjusted model (odds ratio = 3.35, 95% confidence interval 1.47–7.60). Initial self-perceived non-somatic depressive symptoms are significantly associated with MDD severity at its first onset. Workplace support may lead to the early detection and treatment of working patients with non-somatic symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3186499050,"Cefaclor, a second-generation oral cephalosporin, is the most frequently prescribed cephalosporin in Korea. Studies, however, have yet to analyze the incidence of cefaclor-associated adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including hypersensitivity (HS), according to total national usage rates. This study aimed to investigate the incidence rates and clinical features of cefaclor ADRs reported to the Korean Adverse Event Reporting System (KAERS) and Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database for the most recent 5 years. Reviewing the HIRA database, which contains information on all insurance claims, including prescribed medications and patient demographics, we identified the total number of individuals who had been prescribed cefaclor and other cephalosporins including 2nd generation without cefaclor and 3rd generation antibiotics from January 2014 to December 2018. Additionally, we retrospectively analyzed all ADRs reported to the KAERS for these drugs over the same study period. Incidence rates for ADRs, HS, and anaphylaxis to cefaclor were 1.92/10,000 persons, 1.17/10,000 persons, and 0.38/10,000 persons, respectively, lower than those to other 2nd and 3rd cephalosporins. Among all ADRs, HS (60.9% vs. 43.6% vs. 44.8%, P <0.001) and anaphylaxis (19.8% vs. 4.6% vs. 4.7%, P <0.001) were more common for cefaclor than for other 2nd and 3rd cephalosporins. Females, individuals under 65 years of age, concomitant use of drugs, and serious ADRs were more strongly associated with HS to cefaclor than with HS to other 2nd and 3rd cephalosporins. In a nationwide database for the Korean population, the incidence of cefaclor-induced ADRs, particularly HS and anaphylaxis, was high. Female sex, age younger than 65 years, and concomitant use of drugs may be associated with HS to cefaclor."
