https://openalex.org/W2153624566,"Complex networks are studied across many fields of science. To uncover their structural design principles, we defined ""network motifs,"" patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks."
https://openalex.org/W2126602684,"We have determined how most of the transcriptional regulators encoded in the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae associate with genes across the genome in living cells. Just as maps of metabolic networks describe the potential pathways that may be used by a cell to accomplish metabolic processes, this network of regulator-gene interactions describes potential pathways yeast cells can use to regulate global gene expression programs. We use this information to identify network motifs, the simplest units of network architecture, and demonstrate that an automated process can use motifs to assemble a transcriptional regulatory network structure. Our results reveal that eukaryotic cellular functions are highly connected through networks of transcriptional regulators that regulate other transcriptional regulators."

In the boundary layer, air pollution standards are exceeded throughout the region, caused by West and East European pollution from the north. Aerosol particles also reduce solar radiation penetration to the surface, which can suppress precipitation. In the middle troposphere, Asian and to a lesser extent North American pollution is transported from the west. Additional Asian pollution from the east, transported from the monsoon in the upper troposphere, crosses the Mediterranean tropopause, which pollutes the lower stratosphere at middle latitudes."
https://openalex.org/W1666891192,"According to evidence from our laboratory, acidic surfaces on atmospheric aerosols lead to potentially multifold increases in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass. Experimental observations using a multichannel flow reactor, Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene) film bag batch reactors, and outdoor Teflon-film smog chambers strongly confirm that inorganic acids, such as sulfuric acid, catalyze particle-phase heterogeneous reactions of atmospheric organic carbonyl species. The net result is a large increase in SOA mass and stabilized organic layers as particles age. If acid-catalyzed heterogeneous reactions of SOA products are included in current models, the predicted SOA formation will be much greater and could have a much larger impact on climate forcing effects than we now predict."
https://openalex.org/W1967117930,"N -methyl- d -aspartate receptors (NMDARs) mediate ischemic brain damage but also mediate essential neuronal excitation. To treat stroke without blocking NMDARs, we transduced neurons with peptides that disrupted the interaction of NMDARs with the postsynaptic density protein PSD-95. This procedure dissociated NMDARs from downstream neurotoxic signaling without blocking synaptic activity or calcium influx. The peptides, when applied either before or 1 hour after an insult, protected cultured neurons from excitotoxicity, reduced focal ischemic brain damage in rats, and improved their neurological function. This approach circumvents the negative consequences associated with blocking NMDARs and may constitute a practical stroke therapy."

As the metal coverage increases, the particles grow, revealing the dependence of this energy on particle size, which is found to be much stronger than predicted with the usual Gibbs-Thompson relation. It is shown that this knowledge is crucial to accurately model long-term sintering rates of metal nanoparticles in catalysts."
https://openalex.org/W2021766626,"Transcription of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for Notch signaling molecules oscillates with 2-hour cycles, and this oscillation is important for coordinated somite segmentation. However, the molecular mechanism of such oscillation remains to be determined. Here, we show that serum treatment of cultured cells induces cyclic expression of both mRNA and protein of the Notch effector Hes1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor, with 2-hour periodicity. Cycling is cell-autonomous and depends on negative autoregulation of hes1 transcription and ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of Hes1 protein. Because Hes1 oscillation can be seen in many cell types, this clock may regulate timing in many biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W2094818644,"Although aluminum has a smaller modulus in [111]<112> shear than that of copper, we find by first-principles calculation that its ideal shear strength is larger because of a more extended deformation range before softening. This fundamental behavior, along with an abnormally high intrinsic stacking fault energy and a different orientation dependence on pressure hardening, are traced to the directional nature of its bonding. By a comparative analysis of ion relaxations and valence charge redistributions in aluminum and copper, we arrive at contrasting descriptions of bonding characteristics in these two metals that can explain their relative strength and deformation behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2166748873,"Catecholamines signal through the β 2 -adrenergic receptor by promoting production of the second messenger adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP). The magnitude of this signal is restricted by desensitization of the receptors through their binding to β-arrestins and by cAMP degradation by phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes. We show that β-arrestins coordinate both processes by recruiting PDEs to activated β 2 -adrenergic receptors in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. In doing so, the β-arrestins limit activation of membrane-associated cAMP-activated protein kinase by simultaneously slowing the rate of cAMP production through receptor desensitization and increasing the rate of its degradation at the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2084281420,"Obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasites rely on gliding motion powered by their actomyosin system to disperse throughout tissues and to penetrate host cells. Toxoplasma gondii myosin A has been implicated in this process, but direct proof has been lacking. We designed a genetic screen to generate a tetracycline-inducible transactivator system in T. gondii . The MyoA gene was disrupted in the presence of a second regulatable copy of MyoA . Conditional removal of this myosin caused severe impairment in host cell invasion and parasite spreading in cultured cells, and unambiguously established the pathogenic function of this motor in an animal model."
https://openalex.org/W2163154029,"The molecular mechanisms by which central nervous system–specific genes are expressed only in the nervous system and repressed in other tissues remain a central issue in developmental and regulatory biology. Here, we report that the zinc-finger gene-specific repressor element RE-1 silencing transcription factor/neuronal restricted silencing factor (REST/NRSF) can mediate extraneuronal restriction by imposing either active repression via histone deacetylase recruitment or long-term gene silencing using a distinct functional complex. Silencing of neuronal-specific genes requires the recruitment of an associated corepressor, CoREST, that serves as a functional molecular beacon for the recruitment of molecular machinery that imposes silencing across a chromosomal interval, including transcriptional units that do not themselves contain REST/NRSF response elements."
https://openalex.org/W2084904550,"The insulin/IGF-1 (where IGF-1 is insulin-like growth factor-1) signaling pathway influences longevity, reproduction, and diapause in many organisms. Because of the fundamental importance of this system in animal physiology, we asked when during the animal's life it is required to regulate these different processes. We find that in Caenorhabditis elegans, the pathway acts during adulthood, to relatively advanced ages, to influence aging. In contrast, it regulates diapause during development. In addition, the pathway controls longevity and reproduction independently of one another. Together our findings show that life-span regulation can be dissociated temporally from phenotypes that might seem to decrease the quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W4233686569,"Carbon monoxide molecules were arranged in atomically precise configurations, which we call ""molecule cascades,"" where the motion of one molecule causes the subsequent motion of another, and so on in a cascade of motion similar to a row of toppling dominoes. Isotopically pure cascades were assembled on a copper (111) surface with a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope. The hopping rate of carbon monoxide molecules in cascades was found to be independent of temperature below 6 kelvin and to exhibit a pronounced isotope effect, hallmarks of a quantum tunneling process. At higher temperatures, we observed a thermally activated hopping rate with an anomalously low Arrhenius prefactor that we interpret as tunneling from excited vibrational states. We present a cascade-based computation scheme that has all of the devices and interconnects required for the one-time computation of an arbitrary logic function. Logic gates and other devices were implemented by engineered arrangements of molecules at the intersections of cascades. We demonstrate a three-input sorter that uses several AND gates and OR gates, as well as the crossover and fan-out units needed to connect them."
https://openalex.org/W2144924096,"We show that sex steroids protect the adult murine skeleton through a mechanism that is distinct from that used to preserve the mass and function of reproductive organs. The classical genotropic actions of sex steroid receptors are dispensable for their bone protective effects, but essential for their effects on reproductive tissues. A synthetic ligand (4-estren-3alpha,17beta-diol) that reproduces the nongenotropic effects of sex steroids, without affecting classical transcription, increases bone mass and strength in ovariectomized females above the level of the estrogen-replete state and is at least as effective as dihydrotestosterone in orchidectomized males, without affecting reproductive organs. Such ligands merit investigation as potential therapeutic alternatives to hormone replacement for osteoporosis in both women and men [corrected]."
https://openalex.org/W2053300568,"Two autonomous robotic profiling floats deployed in the subarctic North Pacific on 10 April 2001 provided direct records of carbon biomass variability from surface to 1000 meters below surface at daily and diurnal time scales. Eight months of real-time data documented the marine biological response to natural events, including hydrographic changes, multiple storms, and the April 2001 dust event. High-frequency observations of upper ocean particulate organic carbon variability show a near doubling of biomass in the mixed layer over a 2-week period after the passage of a cloud of Gobi desert dust. The temporal evolution of particulate organic carbon enhancement and an increase in chlorophyll use efficiency after the dust storm suggest a biotic response to a natural iron fertilization by the dust."

https://openalex.org/W2088341163,"Widespread evidence for human occupation of the Atacama Desert, 20 degrees to 25 degrees S in northern Chile, has been found from 13,000 calibrated 14C years before the present (cal yr B.P.) to 9500 cal yr B.P., and again after 4500 cal yr B.P. Initial human occupation coincided with a change from very dry environments to humid environments. More than 39 open early Archaic campsites at elevations above 3600 meters show that hunters lived around late glacial/early Holocene paleolakes on the Altiplano. Cessation of the use of the sites between 9500 and 4500 cal yr B.P. is associated with drying of the lakes. The mid-Holocene collapse of human occupation is also recorded in cave deposits. One cave contained Pleistocene fauna associated with human artifacts. Faunal diversity was highest during the humid early Holocene."
https://openalex.org/W1984018744,"The heterotrimeric transcription factor NF-Y recognizes with high specificity and affinity the CCAAT regulatory element that is widely represented in promoters and enhancer regions. The CCAAT box acts in concert with neighboring elements, and its bending by NF-Y is thought to be a major mechanism required for transcription activation. We have solved the structure of the NF-YC/NF-YB subcomplex of NF-Y, which shows that the core domains of both proteins interact through histone fold motifs. This histone-like pair is closely related to the H2A/H2B and NC2α/NC2β families, with features that are both common to this class of proteins and unique to NF-Y. The structure together with the modeling of the nonspecific interaction of NF-YC/NF-YB with DNA and the full NF-Y/CCAAT box complex highlight important structural features that account for different and possibly similar biological functions of the transcriptional regulators NF-Y and NC2. In particular, it emphasizes the role of the newly described αC helix of NF-YC, which is both important for NF-Y trimerization and a target for regulatory proteins, such as MYC and p53."
https://openalex.org/W2059038261,"Rayleigh-Benard convection is caused by buoyancy-driven instability in a confined fluid layer heated from below ([1][1]). The dimensionless Rayleigh number Ra = g α( T 2 − T 1) h 3/νκ expresses the interplay between buoyant forces driving the instability and diffusive restoring forces acting in opposition. Here, α is the coefficient of thermal expansion of the fluid, g is the acceleration due to gravity, T 1 and T 2 are the temperatures of the top and bottom surfaces of the cavity, respectively, h is the height of the cavity, ν is the kinematic viscosity, and κ is the thermal diffusivity.

The inherent structure of Rayleigh-Benard convection—steady circulatory flow between surfaces maintained at two fixed temperatures—is ideally suited for performing thermally activated chemical reactions that require temperature cycling. We have developed a device that uses Rayleigh-Benard convection to perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA inside a 35-μl cylindrical cavity. Instead of the external temperature control of conventional thermocyclers, temperature cycling is achieved as the flow field continually shuttles fluid packets vertically through the temperature zones associated with denaturation (≈95°C) and annealing/extension (60° to 70°C). The steady circulatory flow field must engage the entire reaction volume yet be slow enough to allow the reaction within each temperature zone to reach completion. The parameters available to control the fluid motion are the Rayleigh number and the aspect ratio h / d , where d is the diameter of the cavity. In the case of PCR, the required reaction efficiency constrains the reaction solution and the temperature difference; thus, Ra can only be changed by varying the height of the cavity, leaving geometry as the primary flow control parameter.

We constructed a series of Rayleigh-Benard convection cells by drilling holes in Plexiglas cubes ([Fig. 1][2]A) and imaged the resulting flow patterns by recording the motion of an aqueous suspension of fluorescent latex microspheres ([Fig. 1][2]B). At values of Ra on the order of 105, the convective motion is characterized by steady flow within a single well-defined axisymmetric cellular pattern. Increasing Ra to the vicinity of 106 while holding h / d constant causes the flow velocity to increase, ultimately inducing a transition to an unsteady flow regime. Holding Ra constant in the vicinity of 106 while increasing h / d reverses the unsteady flow transition and restores uniform convective motion. These observations are in qualitative agreement with the results of Muller and co-workers ([2][3]) and suggest a considerable amount of tunability to accommodate a variety of reaction conditions and reagent volumes.

The additional high-migrating band appears in all template-containing reactions and controls ( 6 ).



On the basis of flow visualization studies in a number of geometries, we selected cavities 1.5 cm in height with h / d ≈ 10 for PCR experiments. Convective flow was generated with top and bottom surfaces of the cavity maintained at 61°C and 97°C, respectively ([3][5]). About 9 ng/μl of human DNA template was used, and the target was a 295–base pair (bp) fragment of the single-copy β-Actin gene. As shown in [Fig. 1][2]C, the Rayleigh-Benard PCR (RB-PCR) cell produces an amplification product of the correct size and compares well with the PCR product generated in a thermocycler under similar temperature conditions. In addition to enzyme concentration, the reaction is sensitive to incubation time and the temperature at the top surface of the cell.

The RB-PCR system is exceedingly simple and may be easily assembled in any laboratory. The potential versatility of this system may be further enhanced through improved characterization of convective flow fields in high aspect ratio cavities and studies to optimize PCR in flowing systems.

5. Motion of a dilute aqueous suspension of fluorescent latex microspheres (6-μm diameter; Polysciences) was observed through a fluorescence stereoscope, imaged using an intensified charge-coupled device camera, and recorded to videotape. Averaging the digitized video stream over a time interval of 1 s produced particle paths representative of microsphere trajectories. 

6. This is likely to be an effect of the high temperature at the bottom of the cell (97°C) causing single-stranded scission of the >50 kb template DNA fragments ( 4 ).

Moreover, NOS2 can serve as a locus for tissue O2⨪ production during conditions of low arginine substrate availability, as observed in SCD (22Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martasek P. Hogg N.

Increased rates of production of reactive oxygen- and nitrogen-derived species in tissues mediate the oxidation and nitration of lipids, nucleotides, and susceptible protein amino acid residues. These products also suggest an impairment of biomolecular structure and function. For example, the protein nitration product NO2Tyr is elevated in a variety of inflammatory diseases mediated in part by reactive inflammatory mediators, including atherosclerosis (25Beckman J.S., Ye, Y.Z.

The development of a causal relationship between post-translational protein nitration and impaired tissue function is presently limited by insight into where and how the inflammatory modification of specific protein amino acid residues occurs in vivo and how this is linked with biomolecule dysfunction. Herein, a combination of clinical and knockout-transgenic mouse studies underscores the extensive occurrence of ⋅NO-mediated oxidative inflammatory reactions in SCD, with actin identified as a key target for protein nitration in kidney and liver. This identification of actin as a key tissue target for protein nitration and its impaired polymerization properties reveals the significance of this post-translational protein modification in the physiopathology of SCD and related vascular inflammatory processes. Paraffin-embedded kidney and liver sections were obtained from SCD human autopsy samples and knockout-transgenic SCD mice (37Ryan T.M. Ciavatta D.J. Townes T.M. Science. 1997; 278: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) following approval by the Institutional Review Board for Human Use and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Paraffin-embedded sections were mounted on slides, deparaffinized, and processed for immunofluorescence. Primary antibody incubations were for 60 min at 25 °C using a rabbit polyclonal anti-NO2Tyr (Cayman, 5 μg ml−1) and anti-NOS2 (BD Transduction Laboratories, 16 μg ml−1). The secondary antibody was Alexa-594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, 1:100). Nonspecific staining was ruled out by control experiments performed by preadsorbing anti-NO2Tyr with 10 mmNO2Tyr (not shown). AlexaFluor-488 phalloidin (Molecular Probes, 1 unit) was used for visualizing actin. Images were acquired on a Leitz orthoplan microscope (Leica Inc., Wetzlar, Germany) or a Leica DMIRBE inverted epifluorescence-Nomarski microscope with Leica TCS NT laser confocal optics. Apoptotic cells were visualized with the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT) FragEL DNA fragmentation kit (Oncogene) analogous to TdT-mediated nick end-labeling. Blood was collected from healthy HbA adult volunteers and homozygous HbS patients in anticoagulated (EDTA) Vacutainers as approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Use at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Blood cells were removed by centrifugation, and plasma was stored at −80 °C for subsequent processing and analysis. The liver and kidneys of C57Bl/6J or knockout-transgenic SCD mice, which synthesize exclusively human Hb in the murine red blood cells (37Ryan T.M. Ciavatta D.J. Townes T.M. Science. 1997; 278: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), were dissected, weighed, and homogenized in ice-cold homogenizing buffer (50 mm K2HPO4, 80 μm leupeptin, 2.1 mm Pefabloc SC, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg ml−1aprotinin, pH 7.4). Homogenates were centrifuged (40,000 ×g, 30 min, 4 °C), and supernatants were stored at −80 °C. Plasma and tissue protein NO2Tyr was quantified by gas chromatography-MS as described previously (38Frost M.T. Halliwell B. Moore K.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For use as an internal standard, 3-[13C6]nitrotyrosine was synthesized by the addition of 1.5 mm ONOO− to 6 mm of [13C6]tyrosine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) and purified and quantified via HPLC (38Frost M.T. Halliwell B. Moore K.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite was synthesized as described previously (24Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6698) Google Scholar) and its concentration determined spectrophotometrically at 302 nm (εM = 1670 m−1cm−1). All samples were analyzed immediately following derivatization in the electron ionization mode (EI) with a Varian GC 3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a 30 m × 0.25 mm ID fused silica capillary column having a DB-5 stationary phase and interfaced with a Varian Saturn 2000 mass spectrometer. Tissue actin purification was performed by DNase I affinity chromatography as described previously (39Zechel K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 110: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 40Kron S.J. Drubin D.G. Botstein D. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4466-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 ml of Affi-Gel 10 (BioRad) was transferred to a Buchner funnel and washed with 3 bed volumes of cold deionized water. The gel cake was incubated with 100 mg of DNase I (Roche Diagnostics) and dissolved in 10 ml ice-cold coupling buffer (0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2) for 4 h at 4 °C. The gel slurry was loaded into a column, washed with cold deionized water, and equilibrated with buffer G (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol). Liver and kidney were dissected, weighed, and homogenized in ice-cold buffer G containing 10% formamide (v/v) (Sigma). Homogenates were centrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C), and supernatants were applied to the DNase I-agarose column. The column was washed successively with buffer G, 0.2 m NH4Cl in buffer G containing 10% formamide (v/v) and with buffer G containing 10% formamide (v/v). Adsorbed actin was eluted with buffer G containing 40% formamide (v/v). Pilot studies using actin treated with 0.3 mm ONOO− showed similar chromatographic behavior of native actin. For Western blotting, mouse monoclonal anti-NO2Tyr (Cayman, 2 μg ml−1), rabbit polyclonal anti-NO2Tyr (Cayman, 2 μg ml−1), and anti-NOS2 (BD Transduction Laboratories, 1:800 dilution) were used as primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce, 1:10000) was used as a secondary antibody, and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL reagent, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation, tissue homogenates were cleared with protein A-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 3 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-NO2Tyr (Cayman, 5 μg ml−1) for 1 h followed by protein A-agarose incubation for 3 h at 4 °C. NO2Tyr-containing actin was immunoprecipitated from actin-enriched SCD liver and kidney extracts with a NO2Tyr affinity sorbent (Cayman, 40 μl ml−1). Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by GelCode Coomassie Blue stain reagent (Pierce). In-gel protein digests were prepared as described previously (41Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar, 42Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein bands were excised from gels, destained with acetonitrile/25 mm ammonium bicarbonate (1:1, v/v), and dried. Samples were rehydrated with 12.5 ng μl−1 trypsin (Promega) in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer and digested overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted with acetonitrile/5% formic acid (1:1, v/v), mixed with cyano-4-hydroxycinammic acid (Aldrich) (1:1, v/v), and spotted onto a gold-coated MALDI plate. Peptide molecular ions were analyzed in the positive ion mode using a Voyager DePro mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). The acceleration voltage was set at 20 kV, and 100 laser shots were summed. In some cases, purified rabbit skeletal actin (Sigma, 24 μm) was modified minimally with 0.3 mm ONOO−, denatured with 6 mguanidine hydrochloride, and reduced with 5 mmdithiothreitol for 2 h at 37 °C. Cysteines were alkylated with 1 mm iodoacetamide for 2 h in the dark at 25 °C. Samples were dialyzed on 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off Slide-A-Lyzer Cassettes (Pierce) against 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, and digested with 25 μg of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega). For electrospray analysis, peptide fragments were separated by reverse-phase HPLC column (300 μm × 15 cm C18 PepMap) at a flow rate of 2 μl min−1with a gradient from 20 to 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid over a period of 20 min. For both rabbit- and mouse-derived actin samples, electrospray-mass spectrometry was performed on a Q-TOF II MS (Micromass, Manchester, UK) with automatic functional switching between survey MS and MS/MS modes. A multiply charged peak above 6 counts detected in the mass spectrum was selected automatically for tandem MS analysis. Actin was purified from rabbit hind limb, gel-filtered, and labeled with pyrenyl iodoacetamide (pyrene-labeled actin) as described previously (43Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In some cases control and pyrene-labeled actin were treated with 0.3 mmONOO−, reduced with 2 mm dithiothreitol, and dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, pH 8.0. Control and nitrated actin (9.6 μm) were mixed with equimolar pyrene-conjugated G-actin (1:1, v/v), and polymer formation was monitored by pyrene actin fluorescence (45Cooper J.A. Carraway K.L. Carraway C.A.C. The Cytoskeleton: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1992: 71-74Google Scholar) via an automated microplate fluorescence reader (Fluostar Galaxy, BMG Laboratory Technologies) set at λex = 350 nm and λem = 410 nm. Steady-state polymerization of control and nitrated actin were assayed by fluorescence intensity (λex = 345 nm and λem = 407 nm) of pyrene-labeled actin in 50 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Depolymerization kinetics were measured by mixing nitrated or native pyrene-labeled F-actin with DNase I (with an actin:DNase ratio of 1:5 (mol/mol)) and monitoring fluorescence intensity as above. There was a strong co-distribution of NOS2 and tissue NO2Tyr immunostaining in the renal cortex of knockout-transgenic SCD mice and humans with SCD that was not evident in wild type (control) C57Bl/6J mice or healthy humans expressing HbA (Fig. 1). Distribution of NOS2 expression in SCD kidneys was in distal and proximal tubular epithelial cells and glomeruli. The proximal and distal tubules were immunoreactive for NO2Tyr in both SCD mouse and human but unlike mice, human SCD kidneys were also immunoreactive for NO2Tyr in glomeruli (Fig. 1, A and B). The expression of NOS2 in SCD human and mouse liver was localized to hepatocytes surrounding the central veins and co-distributed with NO2Tyr immunoreactivity (Fig. 2, A and B). Immunoreactive NOS2 and NO2Tyr was significantly less in control mouse and human liver (Fig. 2). Preadsorption of anti-NO2Tyr with NO2Tyr revealed that NO2Tyr immunostaining in kidney and liver sections was specific (not shown). Western blot analysis of NOS2 expression and NO2Tyr in kidney and liver homogenates revealed increased NOS2 expression and protein NO2Tyr content in SCD mice compared with controls (Fig. 4, A and B).Figure 2Immunofluorescent staining of NOS2 and NO2Tyr in control and sickle cell liver.

Plasma protein NO2Tyr content was increased 2.4- and 2.8-fold over controls in SCD humans and mice, 24.7 ± 1.7 and 37.7 ± 6.6 ng/mg protein, respectively (Table I).

The actin-enriched fraction of mouse liver and kidney showed a greater protein NO2Tyr content in both control and SCD mice compared with whole organ homogenates.

Immunoprecipitation of kidney and liver protein extracts with polyclonal anti-NO2Tyr also revealed a NO2Tyr-containing 42-kDa protein (Fig. 4 C) in SCD but not wild type mice. The 42-kDa NO2Tyr-containing protein bands for both liver and kidney were excised from gels following electrophoresis, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Mass fingerprint data sets were analyzed using a Mascot algorithm (46Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S.

Mouse liver and kidney actin were partially purified by DNase I affinity chromatography (Fig. 4 D), and protein nitration was verified by immunoblotting with a polyclonal NO2Tyr antibody (Fig. 4 E). The strong co-localization of actin and NO2Tyr immunoreactivity in the merged fluorescence images (Fig. 6, A and B) also further confirmed actin nitration in SCD kidney and liver.

Whilst ∼11 000 elements were scored as differentially expressed at least twofold in at least one sample, 96 transcripts were scored as over-represented fourfold or more in at least seven out of 39 tumours and 30 sequences 16-fold in at least two out of 39 tumours, including 24 transcripts in common. Transcripts (178) were found under-represented fourfold in at least seven out of 39 tumours, 31 of which are under-represented 16-fold in at least two out of 39 lesions. The relative expression levels of representative genes from these lists were analysed by comparative multiplex RT–PCR and found to be broadly consistent with the microarray data. Two dramatically over-represented genes, previously designated as potential tumour suppressors in breast (maspin) and lung and breast (S100A2) cancers, were analysed more extensively and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in identifying potential lung cancer diagnostic or therapeutic targets. Whilst it has been reported that S100A2 is downregulated in NSCLC at an early stage, our microarray, cmRT–PCR, Western and immunohistochemistry data indicate that it is strongly expressed in the majority of tumours."

We also report the isolation of additional rpoC mutations that lead to MccJ25 resistance in vivo and in vitro. The new mutations affect β′ amino acids in evolutionarily conserved segments G, G′, and F and are exposed into the RNAP secondary channel, a narrow opening that connects the enzyme surface with the catalytic center. We also report that previously known rpoB (RNAP β subunit) mutations that lead to streptolydigin resistance cause resistance to MccJ25.

RNA polymerase streptolydigin microcin J25 isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside Bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP)1 is the central enzyme of gene expression and a target of genetic regulation. The catalytically proficient core enzyme is composed of five polypeptides: the largest subunit β′, the second largest subunit β, the dimer of identical α subunits, and a small subunit ω. Upon the binding of one of the several ς specificity subunits the core is converted to a holoenzyme that can specifically initiate transcription from promoters. RNAP is a target of several inhibitors. Interest is attached to these low molecular weight compounds as they can be used as tools to reveal new information about RNAP mechanism and can also be used as antibacterial drugs. The best studied bacterial RNAP inhibitor, rifampicin, is widely used against mycobacterial infections. Rifampicin and its derivatives bind to the RNAP β subunit (1Ovchinnikov Y.A. Monastyrskaya G.S.

An unrelated inhibitor, streptolydigin (Stl), either affects the binding of incoming NTP in the substrate binding site of RNAP or directly targets the catalysis of phosphodiester bond formation (7Cassani G.

Thus, Stl and α-amanitin may inhibit transcription in their respective systems through similar mechanisms, despite the lack of chemical similarity between the two drugs. The third antibiotic known to target bacterial RNAP, tagetitoxin, inhibits transcription by slowing the rate of RNAP elongation and promoting pausing (16Mathews D.E. Durbin R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 493-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The site of RNAP that tagetitoxin interacts with is not known. Tagetitoxin also inhibits transcription by eukaryotic RNAP III (17Steinberg T.H. Mathews D.E. Durbin R.D. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 499-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the tagetitoxin binding site may be evolutionarily conserved. Recently, one of our groups (18Delgado M.A. Rintoul M.R. Farias R.N. Salomon R.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) reported that Escherichia coli cells harboring a mutation in the rpoC gene, which codes for RNAP β′, became resistant to microcin J25 (18Delgado M.A. Rintoul M.R. Farias R.N. Salomon R.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Microcin J25 (MccJ25) is a bactericidal peptide made of 21 amino acids (19Salomon R.A. Farias R.N. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7428-7435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Blond A. Cheminant M. Segalas-Milazzo I. Peduzzi J. Barthelemy M. Goulard C. Salomon R. Moreno F. Farias R. Rebuffat S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2124-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MccJ25-producing cells harbor a plasmid that is responsible for MccJ25 production and resistance of MccJ25-producing cells to the drug (21Solbiati J.O. Ciaccio M. Farias R.N. Salomon R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3661-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MccJ25 production increases when cells reach stationary phase and nutrients become limiting, thus giving MccJ25-producing cells an advantage (19Salomon R.A. Farias R.N. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7428-7435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chiuchiolo M.J. Delgado M.A. Farias R.N. Salomon R.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1755-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Most of spontaneous MccJ25-resistant mutants affect genes encoding cytoplasmic membrane proteins and appear to be intake mutants (23Salomon R.A. Farias R.N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3323-3325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that a rare microcin resistance mutation resulted in altered RNAP suggested that RNAP may be the cellular target of MccJ25. In agreement with this idea, it has been shown that in vitro activity ofE. coli RNAP is reduced in the presence of micromolar concentrations of MccJ25 (18Delgado M.A. Rintoul M.R. Farias R.N. Salomon R.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The rpoC mutation that resulted in MccJ25 resistance caused a substitution of an evolutionarily conserved β′ Thr931for Ile. Thr931 is part of segment G, whose sequence is well conserved in largest (β′-like) RNAP subunits from bacteria to man (15Allison L.A. Moyle M. Shales M. Ingles C.J. Cell. 1985; 42: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In the structural model of RNAP core from thermophilic eubacterium Thermus aquaticus a residue equivalent toE. coli β′ Thr931 is exposed on the inner surface of RNAP secondary channel, a narrow opening that leads from RNAP surface to the catalytic center (24Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Based on structural considerations, the secondary channel was hypothesized to direct substrates toward the enzyme active site and to accept the 3′-end-proximal portion of the nascent RNA in transcription elongation complexes that assumed the dead-end conformation (24Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 25Korzheva N. Mustaev A. Kozlov M. Malhotra A.

Microbiol. 2000; 3: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the location of the residue affected by rpoC MccJ25 resistance mutation suggests a novel mechanism of RNAP inhibition: occlusion of RNAP secondary channel. Here, we report the isolation of several MccJ25 resistance mutations in evolutionarily conserved segments G, G′, and F of cloned E. coli rpoC. The locations of the corresponding β′ residues on the T. aquaticus RNAP structure are exposed in the inside surface of RNAP secondary channel, strongly supporting the idea that MccJ25 inhibits transcription by binding to and occluding this channel. Plasmids pRW308 (27Weilbaecher R. Hebron C. Feng G. Landick R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2913-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and pRL663 (12Severinov K. Markov D. Nikiforov V. Severinova E. Landick R. Darst S.A. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23926-23929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), overproducing wild-type or C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged β′ subunit, respectively, were used to obtain MccJ25-resistant mutations. MccJ25 resistant rpoC mutants generated by error-prone PCR were selected from plasmid banks described by Weilbaecher et al. (27Weilbaecher R. Hebron C. Feng G. Landick R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2913-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To generate site-specific mutations in segment G, a derivative of pRW308 harboring a uniqueXhoI site at rpoC codon 943 was created by PCR mutagenesis. The β′ subunit encoded by the resultant plasmid, pRW308Xho_943, was wild-type because of the degeneracy of the genetic code. The rpoC positions 928, 929, 930, and 931 were next randomized using mutagenic oligonucleotides complementary torpoC codons 922–946 and incorporating a XhoI site at codon 943. At the site of randomization, positions corresponding to the first and second bases of the codon were equimolar mixtures of A, G, C, and T, whereas positions corresponding to the third base of the codon was an equimolar mixture of G and C. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were used as primers in a PCR reaction with pRW308Xho_943 template. As a second primer, an oligonucleotide whose sequence corresponded to rpoCpositions 2534–2555 was used. This primer anneals upstream of a unique pRW308 SalI site located at rpoC position 2629. After amplification, PCR fragments were treated with SalI and XhoI and ligated into appropriately treated pRW308Xho_943. Ligation mixtures were transformed in MccJ25-sensitive DH5α E. coli host cells, and transformants were plated on solid LB medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin. After overnight growth at 37 °C, recombinant colonies were replica-plated on LB plates containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml MccJ25 (purified as described previously; see Ref. 20Blond A. Cheminant M. Segalas-Milazzo I. Peduzzi J. Barthelemy M. Goulard C. Salomon R. Moreno F. Farias R. Rebuffat S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2124-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and 1 mm IPTG to derepress the lac promoter that drives expression of plasmid-borne rpoC. MccJ25-resistant colonies were purified, and plasmid DNA was prepared and retransformed into DH5α E. coli cells. Transformants were plated on plates containing MccJ25 to confirm that resistance is plasmid-borne. An entire SalI-XhoI rpoC fragment was next sequenced at the Rockefeller University DNA technology center to establish the nature of the mutational change leading to MccJ25 resistance. To randomize rpoC codons 1136 and 1137 (evolutionarily conserved segment G′) we made use of a unique SgrAI recognition site at rpoC position 3402 (codon 1134). Mutagenic oligonucleotides spanned the SgrAI site, as well as positions to be randomized. They were used as primers with pRL663 template and another primer, whose sequence was complementary torpoC positions 3745–3777. This primer anneals downstream of a unique pRL663 BspEI site located at rpoCposition 3639. PCR fragments were treated with SgrAI andBspEI and ligated with appropriately treated pRL663, and MccJ25-resistant clones were selected and confirmed as above. In addition to the SgrAI-BspEI fragment, a portion of rpoC coding for β′ segments F and G in mutant plasmids was also sequenced, and no changes from the published sequence were observed. Construction of the β′Δ(943–1130) mutation will be described elsewhere. 2I. Artsimovitch, V. Svetlov, K. Murakami, and R. Landick, manuscript in preparation. Highly pure RNAP from MccJ25-resistant E. coli SBG231cells (18Delgado M.A. Rintoul M.R. Farias R.N. Salomon R.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and parental MccJ25-sensitive AB259 cells were purified as described (30Polyakov A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1995; 8: 365-373Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar). RNAP from Xanthomonas oryzae was purified as described in Ref. 31Nechaev S. Yuzhenkova Y. Niedziela-Majka A. Heyduk T. Severinov K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar. RNAP fromPseudomonas aeruginosa 8882 strain (provided by Dr. A. Chakrabarty, University of Illinois College of Medicine) was purified by standard E. coli procedure without modifications.Bacillus subtilis RNAP was purified from B. subtilis PolHis cells harboring a genomic rpoCgenetically fused to hexahistidine tag (generously provided by Drs. C. P. Moran and G. Schyns, Emory University School of Medicine). RNAP was purified from cell lysates by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography followed by ion-exchange on Resource Q (Amersham Biosciences) column. Recombinant RNAP from T. aquaticus was purified from overexpressing E. colicells as described in Ref. 32Le Grice S.F. Shih C.C. Whipple F. Sonenshein A.L. Mol. Gen.

Mutant β′ Δ(943–1130) RNAP was purified by chitin-affinity chromatography and intein-mediated removal of the chitin binding domain tag, followed by heparin affinity column chromatography, as described elsewhere.2 To partially purify RNAP containing β′ expressed from a plasmid, E. coli 397C cells (29Nedea E.C. Markov D. Naryshkina T. Severinov K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2663-2665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were transformed with pRW308, pRL663, or their derivatives, grown at 30 °C in 200 ml of LB medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin untilA 600 of 0.5, induced with 1 mm IPTG for 4 h, collected, disrupted by sonication, and polymin P fractionation was performed as described by Kashlev et al.(28Kashlev M. Nudler E. Severinov K. Borukhov S. Komissarova N. Goldfarb A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 1 m NaCl extract of polymin P pellet containing ∼10% pure RNAP was precipitated with ammonium sulfate, and precipitate was stored at −80 °C. Before use, an aliquot of ammonium sulfate pellet was dissolved in transcription buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol) to give a final protein concentration of ∼1 mg/ml, and this preparation was used in transcription assays. Transcription from the T7 A1 promoter-containing DNA fragment was performed in 10-μl transcription buffer reactions containing 50 ng of DNA, 0.5 μg of wild-type or mutant RNAP, 0.5 mm CpA primer, 2.5 μm α-[32P]UTP (300 Ci/mmol), and different concentrations of MccJ25. Reactions proceeded for 10 min at 37 °C and were terminated by the addition of urea-containing loading buffer. Products were analyzed by urea-PAGE electrophoresis (7m urea, 20% polyacrylamide), followed by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis. Transcription from B. subtilis vegA promoter (32Le Grice S.F. Shih C.C. Whipple F. Sonenshein A.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 204: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was performed in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin using 0.5 mm UpA primer and 2.5 μmα-[32P]GTP (300 Ci/mmol) substrate. Earlier, one of our groups (18Delgado M.A. Rintoul M.R. Farias R.N. Salomon R.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) reported thatE. coli cells harboring the sjmA1 mutation, but not the wild-type E. coli, were able to grow on selective medium containing MccJ25. The sjmA1 mutation was found to correspond to a substitution of Thr931 to Ile in the largest subunit of E. coli RNAP, the β′ subunit. The original report also established that MccJ25 partially inhibited a steady-state in vitro transcription by the wild-typeE. coli RNAP, strongly implying that RNAP is a direct target of MccJ25. However, RNAP harboring the T931I substitution was not tested in these experiments. The experiment presented in Fig. 1 demonstrates that the mutant enzyme is indeed resistant to MccJ25 in vitro. As can be seen, MccJ25 inhibited T7 A1 promoter-directed synthesis of the CpApU abortive RNA product from the CpA dinucleotide primer and radioactively labeled UTP by the wild-type RNAP (compare lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, the CpApU synthesis by RNAP purified from cells harboring thesjmA1 mutation was unaffected by the drug (comparelanes 1 and 2). Order-of-addition experiments established that MccJ25 inhibited abortive RNA synthesis when added either before or after the formation of open promoter complex on the T7 A1 promoter-containing DNA fragment used as a template in this experiment (compare lanes 5 and 6). We therefore conclude that (i) RNAP is a true cellular target of MccJ25, and (ii) MccJ25 does not act by preventing RNAP interaction with DNA. The genetic context of thesjmA1 mutation is shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, the corresponding substitution occurred in a highly conserved segment of the E. coli β′ subunit, segment G. We hypothesize that the T931I substitution causes MccJ25 resistance by preventing MccJ25 binding to RNAP and that Thr931 is a part of MccJ25 binding site. Given the very high level of evolutionary conservation of segment G, the following two questions are of interest. First, can other MccJ25-resistant mutations in segment G be obtained? Second, will MccJ25 inhibit RNAPs from organisms other than E. coli? To answer the first question, we obtained plasmids expressing mutantrpoC genes, transformed these plasmids into MccJ25-sensitiveE. coli cells, and checked the ability of plasmid-bearing cells to grow on a medium containing MccJ25. In case when growth on selective medium was observed, we purified RNAPs containing mutant β′ and confirmed that mutant RNAPs were indeed resistant to MccJ25. In cases when no in vivo resistance was observed, we considered the possibility that RNAP containing mutant β′ could not support cell growth in the presence of MccJ25, when the wild-type, chromosomally encoded RNAP was inactivated. Therefore, RNAPs containing plasmid-borne β′ were also purified, and their sensitivity to MccJ25 was testedin vitro. All mutants reported below were tested this way. Fig. 2 shows the results of in vivo and complementary in vitro testing with some of the mutants as an example. A set of several point mutations in segment G of E. coli rpoC cloned on an expression plasmid was recovered in two unrelated screens, one aimed at obtaining termination-alteringrpoC mutants (27Weilbaecher R. Hebron C. Feng G. Landick R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2913-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and another site-specifically mutating evolutionarily conserved β′ positions 921 and 935,2 is presented atop of the sequence alignment shown in Fig. 3. MccJ25-sensitiveE. coli cells were transformed with plasmids expressing mutant rpoC genes, and the ability of plasmid-bearing cells to grow on MccJ25-containing medium was investigated. As controls, cells harboring plasmids expressing wild-type rpoC or MccJ25-resistant rpoCT931I allele were employed. As expected, cells expressing wild-type rpoC were sensitive to MccJ25, whereas cells expressing the T931I allele were resistant (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Cells harboring expression plasmids bearing the F935S allele were as resistant as control cells expressing rpoC T931I, whereas cells expressing the R933H,A946V double mutant resulted in slow but detectable growth on MccJ25-containing medium (Fig. 2 and data not shown). In contrast, cells expressingQ921P, T934M, and H936Y alleles did not grow on selective medium (Fig. 2 and data not shown). The results of in vitro transcription assays correlated with the in vivo results (Fig. 2) (data not shown). However, theR933H,A946V double mutant, which showed low levels of resistance in vivo, was highly resistant in vitro, suggesting that the mutant RNAP in vivo function is impaired. RNAP harboring the F935S substitution was found to be resistant to the drug, whereas other mutants were sensitive. Three RNAP harboring dominant lethal mutations in segment G, M932L, R933S, and T934A, were also tested for MccJ25 resistance. These mutants were obtained in the course of an independent mutagenesis effort 3V. Epshtein, A. Mustaev, and A. Goldfarb, submitted for publication. and were prepared byin vitro reconstitution. Additional MccJ25-resistant mutants in segment G were also sought directly. Three rpoC codons immediately to the left of position 931 (928, 929, and 930) were randomized by site-directed PCR mutagenesis, libraries of recombinant plasmids were transformed in MccJ25-sensitive E. coli cells, and MccJ25-resistant clones were selected. As a control, position 931, the site of the original MccJ25-resistant mutation, was also randomized. MccJ25-resistant clones were only obtained in the control mutagenesis reaction. Sequencing of three resistant clones revealed the presence of the original mutation, T931I, as well as two new mutations, T931N and T931L. The corresponding enzymes were also resistant in vitro (data not shown). The result thus suggests that the identity of β′ amino acids 928–930 is either not important for MccJ25 inhibition, or MccJ25-resistant substitutions at these positions lead to lethal phenotype. MccJ25 is effective against Gram-negative bacteria but has no effect on Gram-positive bacteria (19Salomon R.A. Farias R.N. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7428-7435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of transcription inhibition by MccJ25, we assembled a panel of RNAPs prepared from several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and compared their ability to perform abortive RNA synthesis in the presence or in the absence of MccJ25 (Fig. 4). In the absence of MccJ25, RNAPs from Gram-negative bacteria demonstrated approximately equal specific activities on the T7 A1 promoter (0.9, 0.6, 1.2, and 0.8 pmol/min of CpApU synthesized by 1 pmol of wild-type E. coliRNAP, E. coli RNAPT931I, P. aeruginosa RNAP, and X. oryzae RNAP, respectively). In agreement with the previously determined in vivospecificity, MccJ25 inhibited abortive synthesis of CpApU from the T7 A1 promoter-containing DNA fragment by RNAPs prepared from three Gram-negative bacteria, wild-type E. coli, X. oryzae, and P. aeruginosa (see Fig. 4; 10, 11, and 9% residual activity in the presence of 25 μm MccJ25, respectively). As expected, E. coli RNAPT931Iwas active in the presence of 25 μm MccJ25 (85% activity). RNAP from T. aquaticus was assayed on the T7 A1 promoter at 60 °C and was considerably less active (0.2 pmol of CpApU synthesized per min per pmol of enzyme). MccJ25 had no effect on abortive synthesis by recombinant T. aquaticus RNAP at 60 °C (see Fig. 4; 100% activity in the presence of 25 μm MccJ25). Because RNAP from B. subtilis displays only a very low level of activity on the T7 A1 promoter (data not shown), we assayed the effect of MccJ25 on this enzyme during the abortive synthesis of UpApG on B. subtilis vegA promoter (32Le Grice S.F. Shih C.C. Whipple F. Sonenshein A.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 204: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the absence of MccJ25,B. subtilis RNAP, E. coli RNAP, and E. coli RNAPT931I demonstrated comparable levels of activity on the vegA promoter (0.8, 0.3, and 0.1 pmol of UpApG synthesized per min per pmol of RNAP, respectively). MccJ25 had no effect on the B. subtilis enzyme (see Fig. 4; 110% activity in the presence of 25 μm MccJ25) and E. coli RNAPT931I (see Fig. 4; 85% activity in the presence of 25 μm MccJ25) but was active against wild-type E. coli enzyme on this promoter (see Fig. 4; 11% activity in the presence of 25 μm MccJ25). Additional experiments demonstrated that MccJ25 had no effect on transcription by yeast RNAPs II and III (data not shown). Because segment G positions affected by MccJ25-resistant substitutions are identical in β′ homologues from Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, the result implies that other regions of RNAP may also contribute to MccJ25 binding. In RNAP from Gram-negative bacteria, segment G is followed by a long stretch of amino acid sequence that is hypervariable in evolution (33Zakharova N. Bass A. Arsenieva E. Nikiforov V. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24912-24920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The hypervariable region is missing in RNAPs from Gram-positive bacteria and eukaryal RNAPs. To test whether the presence of the evolutionarily hypervariable region of β′ contributes to the MccJ25 sensitivity of RNAP from Gram-negative bacteria, we tested the ability ofrpoCΔ(943–1130) allele that lacks the entire hypervariable region and thus resembles homologues from Gram-positive microorganisms to confer MccJ25 resistance in vivo. The mutant β′ poorly assembles into RNAP, presumably because of its inability to compete with chromosomally encoded wild-type β′. 4I. Artsimovitch, personal observation. We therefore tested the ability of MccJ25-sensitive cells harboring plasmid pIA331, which, in the presence of IPTG, co-overexpresses wild-type rpoA(α), rpoB (β), andrpoCΔ(943–1130) and thus increases the efficiency of the mutant enzyme assembly to grow on MccJ25-containing medium. As controls, plasmid pIA423, which co-overexpresses wild-typerpoA, rpoB, and rpoC, and pRL663rpoC + and pRL663rpoCT931Iplasmids, were used. As can be seen from Fig. 5 A, cells harboring pIA331 and pRL663T931I, but not cells harboring pIA423 and pRL663, formed colonies in the presence of MccJ25 and IPTG. Colonies formed by cells harboring pIA331 were minute as compared with colonies formed by cells harboring pRL663rpoCT931I cells, but the efficiency of plating was comparable. Plasmid pIA331, but not other plasmids, significantly inhibited cell growth in the presence of IPTG only, suggesting that RNAPΔ(943–1130) was defective in some cellular function(s) unrelated to MccJ25 resistance. Be that as it may, the results demonstrate that hypervariable region indeed contributes to MccJ25 sensitivity and may be partially dispensable for cell viability at our conditions, because RNAP lacking β′ residues 943–1130 is presumably the only transcriptionally active enzyme in the presence of MccJ25. E. coli RNAPΔ(943–1130) was prepared from cells harboring pIA331 and tested for the ability to transcribe from the T7 A1 promoter in the presence or in the absence of MccJ25 (Fig. 5 B). The results showed that the mutant was more resistant to the drug than wild-type E. coli RNAP (26 and 3% residual activity in the presence of 50 μm MccJ25). Because RNAPs from Gram-positive bacteria are highly resistant to MccJ25 in vitro, other sites in these RNAPs must contribute to MccJ25 resistance. In the β′ subunits from Gram-negative bacteria, the hypervariable segment is followed by evolutionarily conserved segment G′ (33Zakharova N. Bass A. Arsenieva E. Nikiforov V. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24912-24920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because there is no hypervariable region in homologues from Gram-positive bacteria, segments G and G′ form a continuous stretch of evolutionary conserved sequence in the β′ subunits from these organisms (Fig. 3). Segment G residues that cause MccJ25 resistance are part of the so-called G-loop in RNAP structures from thermophilic bacteria of the Thermus genus (24Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 34Vassylyev D.G. Sekine S. Laptenko O. Lee J. Vassylyeva M.N. Borukhov S. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 417: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 35Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Residues of segment G′ are also part of the G-loop. In particular,Thermus RNAP residues corresponding to E. coliβ′ amino acids 1137 and 1138 are in direct contact with the residue corresponding to E. coli Thr931 and are located at the base of the G-loop. We therefore considered a possibility that substitutions in positions 1137 and 1138 will make E. coliRNAP MccJ25-resistant. Accordingly, codons 1137 and 1138 of plasmid-borne rpoC were randomized, mutant plasmid libraries were transformed in MccJ25-sensitive E. coli, and transformants were plated on selective medium containing MccJ25. No MccJ25-resistant mutants were obtained when codon 1137 was randomized. One clone was picked up at random and found to encode a G1137A substitution; the corresponding RNAP was MccJ25-sensitive in vitro. One resistant clone, coding for L1138T, was recovered from codon 1138 mutagenesis. The corresponding RNAP was purified and found to be MccJ25-resistant in vitro (Fig. 2). Because no changes from the published rpoC sequence in segment G was observed in this mutant (data not shown), we conclude that a substitution in segment G′ is indeed responsible for MccJ25 resistance. One MccJ25-sensitive clone from the 1138 mutagenesis reaction was picked up at random and sequenced and found to contain a mutation coding for L1138V substitution. The corresponding RNAP was purified and found to be MccJ25-sensitive in vitro (data not shown). A functional deletion of β′ amino acids 1145–1198 immediately to the right of segment G′ was described by us previously (33Zakharova N. Bass A. Arsenieva E. Nikiforov V. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24912-24920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This deletion did not result in MccJ25 resistance in vivo and in vitro (data not shown). A double mutation coding for E1030K and I1134D substitutions was isolated in an independent PCR-based screen for termination-alteringrpoC mutations (27Weilbaecher R. Hebron C. Feng G. Landick R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2913-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The first substitution, of Glu1030, occurred in the hypervariable region; the second substitution, of Ile1134, occurred in segment G′. We tested the ability of plasmid-borne E1030K,I1134D allele to confer MccJ25 resistance in vivo and in vitroand observed no resistance (data not shown). We also looked for additional MccJ25-resistant mutations within the bank ofrpoC expression plasmids subjected to error-prone PCR at and around segments G and G′ (rpoC codons 876–1213; see Ref.27Weilbaecher R. Hebron C. Feng G. Landick R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2913-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A triple mutation coding for I1115V, G1136D, and F1145S substitutions was recovered in this way. Of the three residues affected, one (β′ Phe1145) is removed by MccJ25-sensitive Δ(1145–1198) deletion. Substitutions I1115V and/or G1136D are thus likely responsible for MccJ25 resistance. Because I1115V is a conservative substitution, substitution of evolutionarily conserved Gly1136 in segment G′ is the probable cause of MccJ25 resistance. Residues of β′ segments G and G′ that are important for MccJ25 inhibition are exposed on the surface of narrow RNAP secondary channel that opens on the downstream face of the enzyme and leads to the catalytic site (24Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). In addition to β′ segments G and G′, conserved segment F also participates in the formation of the secondary channel. We were therefore interested in whether MccJ25-resistant mutations in segment F can be obtained. Toward this end, we tested two segment F mutants, F773I and S793F, that were shown previously to cause resistance to the elongation inhibitor, streptolydigin (12Severinov K. Markov D. Nikiforov V. Severinova E. Landick R. Darst S.A. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23926-23929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These mutants did not result in appreciable MccJ25 resistance in vivo or in vitro (Fig. 2) (data not shown). We therefore looked for MccJ25-resistant region F mutants directly, by incorporating an error-prone PCR-amplified rpoCfragment coding for region F (rpoC codons 544–875) into anrpoC expression plasmid, transforming mutant plasmids in MccJ25-sensitive host, and selecting MccJ25-resistant colonies. Several independent MccJ25-resistant colonies were obtained, and the plasmid-borne nature of MccJ25 resistance was confirmed by retransforming of rpoC expression plasmids from MccJ25-resistant clones into sensitive host and replating on selective medium. Four independent clones were obtained, and their sequence at and around segments F, G, and G′ was determined. No changes in segment G/G′ sequences was detected. In contrast, changes from the published sequence leading to substitutions of segment F residues Ser733 for Pro, Leu783 for Gln, and a double substitution of Leu746 for Pro and Phe773 for Ile were observed (Fig. 6). In vitro analysis confirmed that RNAPs carrying mutations in segment F are resistant to MccJ25 (Fig. 2) (data not shown). We conclude that substitutions in RNAP β′ segment F lead to MccJ25 resistance. Substitutions in β′ segment F that lead to MccJ25 resistance occurred close to segment F sites that, when mutated, cause Stl resistance (12Severinov K. Markov D. Nikiforov V. Severinova E. Landick R. Darst S.A. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23926-23929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The main cluster of Stl-resistant mutations is located in the β subunit, between Rif clusters I and II (3Severinov K. Soushko M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14280-14825Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). To further investigate the relationship between MccJ25 and Stl resistance we tested the ability of E. coli cells expressing several MccJ25-resistant alleles to grow in the presence of Stl, and we tested the ability of cells expressing Stl-resistant rpoB(β) alleles to grow in the presence of MccJ25. As expected, cells overproducing Stl-resistant β′ harboring S793F substitution, as well as cells overproducing Stl-resistant β subunit microdeletionsΔ(540–544) andΔ(540L545) (3Severinov K. Soushko M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14280-14825Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), but not cells overproducing wild-type β′ or β, grew on plates containing Stl. Also as expected, cells overproducing partially Stl-resistant βΔ(535–542) formed minute colonies in the presence of Stl, whereas cells overproducing Stl-sensitive βΔ(538–540) did not grow (3Severinov K. Soushko M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14280-14825Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) (data not shown). None of the segment F, segment G, or segment G′ MccJ25-resistantrpoC mutations tested allowed growth on Stl-containing plates (data not shown). Plating of cells expressing Stl-resistant rpoB alleles on MccJ25 gave an unexpected result. As expected cells expressingrpoCT931I, but not cells expressing wild-typerpoC or Stl-resistant rpoCS793F, grew in the presence of MccJ25 (Fig. 7). Likewise, cells expressing wild-type rpoB and Stl-sensitiverpoBΔ(538–540) did not grow in the presence of MccJ25. In contrast, cells expressing highly Stl-resistantΔ(540–544) andΔ(540L545) grew in the presence of MccJ25, whereas cells expressing low-level Stl resistance allelerpoBΔ(535–542) formed minute colonies. The results of the plating assay were supported by the results of in vitro transcription experiments (data not shown). We also tested several plasmid-borne Rifampicin-resistant rpoB mutants and found that none of them were able to support growth in the presence of MccJ25 (data not shown). We conclude that Stl-resistant mutations in the rpoB gene lead to MccJ25 resistance. The principal result of this work is the demonstration that transcription by mutant RNAP purified from MccJ25-resistant E. coli cells is resistant to MccJ25, whereas transcription by RNAP purified from wild-type cells is MccJ25-sensitive. This result proves that E. coli RNAP is the cellular target of MccJ25. In the best understood case of Rifampicin, mutations toward resistance affect RNAP residues that are removed from each other in primary sequence but that cluster in the enzyme quaternary structure (1Ovchinnikov Y.A.

Structural analysis demonstrates that Rif-resistance mutation define the Rifampicin binding site (4Campbell E.A. Korzheva N. Mustaev A. Murakami K. Nair S. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 901-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the original MccJ25-resistance mutation, that changed evolutionarily conserved amino acid inside RNAP secondary channel, likewise defines the MccJ25 binding site on RNAP. According to this view, MccJ25 inhibits transcription by binding in the secondary channel and preventing the traffic of NTP substrates to the catalytic center of the enzyme. Indeed, molecular modeling using T. aquaticus RNAP structure and a reported MccJ25 structure (20Blond A. Cheminant M. Segalas-Milazzo I. Peduzzi J. Barthelemy M. Goulard C. Salomon R. Moreno F. Farias R. Rebuffat S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2124-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) shows that 21-amino acid MccJ25 can fit into RNAP secondary channel with little or no steric clashes (data not shown)."

https://openalex.org/W2327287238,"Intracellular signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases regulates many different aspects of cell behavior. Recent studies in our laboratory and others have demonstrated that the EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase critically regulates tumor cell growth, migration and invasiveness. Although the cellular consequences of EphA2 signaling have been the focus of recent attention, the biochemical changes that are triggered by ligand-mediated activation of EphA2 remain largely unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that ligand stimulation of EphA2 promotes the nucleus translocation and phosphorylation of ERK kinases, followed by an increase in nuclear induction of the Elk-1 transcription factor. Ligand-mediated activation allows EphA2 to form a molecular complex with the SHC and GRB2 adaptor proteins. Specifically, we demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylated EphA2 interacts with the PTB and SH2 domains of SHC. We also show that the interaction of EphA2 with GRB2 is indirect and mediated by SHC and that this complex is necessary for EphA2-mediated activation of ERK kinases. These studies provide a novel mechanism to demonstrate how EphA2 can convey information from the cell exterior to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2092027730,"Mutational inactivation of BRCA1 confers increased risk for breast cancer. However, the underlying basis for the breast tissue-restricted, tumor-suppressive properties of BRCA1 remains poorly defined. Here, we show that BRCA1 and the estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) modulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene transcription and secretion in breast cancer cells. ER-alpha interacted in vitro and in vivo with BRCA1, and this interaction was mediated by the AF-2 domain of ER-alpha and two domains of BRCA1, the amino-acid residues 1-306 and 428-683. Endogenous interaction of ER-alpha with BRCA1 was observed in normal MCF-10A breast epithelial cells and in breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and T47D), and this interaction was significantly reduced in the presence of estrogen. Furthermore, ER-alpha induced activation of VEGF gene transcription, using human VEGF promoter-luciferase reporter constructs. The AF-2 domain of ER-alpha was also shown to induce VEGF gene transcription activation similar to that obtained with the full-length ER-alpha. However, in the presence of BRCA1, VEGF gene transcription activation and VEGF protein secretion were significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. The BRCA1 domain of 1-683 amino acid residues was required for this inhibition of VEGF gene transcription activation. Three mutated forms of BRCA1 (A1708E, M1775R and Y1853X), that have been identified in familial breast cancers, failed to associate with ER-alpha and to suppress VEGF promoter activity and VEGF protein secretion. Overexpression of wild-type BRCA1 in HCC-1937 breast cancer cells that lack endogenous functional BRCA1 significantly reduced VEGF secretion in these cells. These results demonstrate a novel pathogenic mechanism whereby mutations in BRCA1, via their interaction with ER-alpha, could promote tumorigenesis through the hormonal regulation of mammary epithelial cell proliferation and impaired VEGF function, which may lead to cancer growth and angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2329282236,"Junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) is a Ca2+-independent immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecule which localizes at tight junctions (TJs). Claudin is a key cell-cell adhesion molecule that forms TJ strands at TJs. JAM is associated with claudin through their cytoplasmic tail-binding protein, ZO-1. JAM is furthermore associated with Par-3, a cell polarity protein which forms a ternary complex with Par-6 and atypical protein kinase C. Nectin is another Ca2+-independent immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecule which localizes at adherens junctions (AJs). Nectin is associated with E-cadherin through their respective cytoplasmic tail-binding proteins, afadin and catenins, and involved in the formation of AJs cooperatively with E-cadherin. We show here that nectin is furthermore involved in the localization of JAM at TJs. During the formation of the junctional complex consisting of AJs and TJs in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, JAM was recruited to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites. This recruitment of JAM was inhibited by nectin inhibitors, which inhibited the trans-interaction of nectin. Microbeads coated with the extracellular fragment of nectin, that interacted with cellular nectin, also recruited JAM to the bead-MDCK cell contact sites. Furthermore, when cadherin-deficient L fibroblasts stably expressing both exogenous JAM and nectin (nectin-JAM-L cells) were co-cultured with L fibroblasts expressing only nectin (nectin-L cells), JAM was concentrated at the cell-cell adhesion sites between nectin-JAM-L and nectin-L cells without the trans-interaction of JAM. Analyses of the localization and immunoprecipitation of JAM revealed that it was associated with nectin through afadin and ZO-1. These results suggest that nectin has a role in the localization of JAM at TJs in the process of the formation of the junctional complex in epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2015794035,"AP-1 transcription factors play a critical role in signal transduction pathways in many cells. We have investigated the role of AP-1 in controlling proliferative signals in breast cells, and have previously shown that AP-1 complexes are activated by peptide and steroid growth factors in both normal and malignant breast cells. In this study, we investigated the role of AP-1 in transducing proliferative signals induced by peptide and steroid growth factors. We used MCF-7 clones that express a specific inhibitor of AP-1, a dominant-negative cJun mutant (TAM67), under the control of an inducible promoter to investigate the role of AP-1 in regulating breast cancer growth. In the presence of doxycycline (Dox), the AP-1 inhibitor was not expressed, and the MCF-7 clones proliferated normally in response to serum stimulation. However, when Dox was withdrawn, TAM67 was expressed, AP-1 activity was inhibited, and serum-induced proliferation was blocked. We next investigated whether the mitogenic response to specific growth factors also requires AP-1. MCF-7 Tet-Off-TAM67 cells were grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of IGF-1, EGF, heregulin-beta, bFGF, or estrogen under un-induced and induced conditions. These studies showed that the AP-1 inhibitor completely blocked proliferation in response to the peptide growth factors (IGF-1, EGF, heregulin-beta, and bFGF), and partially blocked the response to estrogen. To investigate the effect of AP-1 blockade on in vivo tumor growth, we injected the MCF-7 Tet-Off TAM67 cells into nude mice receiving doxycycline to suppress the expression of the AP-1 inhibitor. After the mice developed tumors, they were randomized to either continue to receive Dox or not. In mice not receiving Dox, the expression of TAM67 was induced, and tumor growth was inhibited, while the tumors in mice receiving Dox continued to grow. Analysis of the tumors from these mice showed that the expression of TAM67 caused reduced proliferation of the breast cancer cells without inducing apoptosis. These results demonstrate that AP-1 blockade supresses mitogenic signals from multiple different peptide growth factors as well as estrogen, and inhibits the growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that novel agents specifically targeting AP-1 or its activating kinases could be promising agents for the treatment of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2081048050,"RACK1 is one of a group of PKC-interacting proteins collectively called RACKs (Receptors for Activated C-Kinases). Previously, we showed that RACK1 also interacts with the Src tyrosine kinase, and is an inhibitor of Src activity and cell growth. PKC activation induces the intracellular movement and co-localization of RACK1 and Src, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of RACK1. To determine whether RACK1 is a Src substrate, we assessed phosphorylation of RACK1 by various tyrosine kinases in vitro, and by kinase-active and inactive mutants of Src in vivo. We found that RACK1 is a Src substrate. Moreover, Src activity is necessary for both the tyrosine phosphorylation of RACK1 and the binding of RACK1 to Src's SH2 domain that occur following PKC activation. To identify the tyrosine(s) on RACK1 that is phosphorylated by Src, we generated and tested a series of RACK1 mutants. We found that Src phosphorylates RACK1 on Tyr 228 and/or Tyr 246, highly-conserved tyrosines located in the sixth WD repeat that interact with Src's SH2 domain. We think that RACK1 is an important Src substrate that signals downstream of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and is involved in the regulation of Src function and cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1999146507,"The pEg3 protein is a member of the evolutionarily conserved KIN1/PAR-1/MARK kinase family which is involved in cell polarity and microtubule dynamics. In Xenopus, pEg3 has been shown to be a cell cycle dependent kinase whose activity increases to a maximum level during mitosis of the first embryonic cell division. CDC25B is one of the three CDC25 phosphatase genes identified in human. It is thought to regulate the G2/M progression by dephosphorylating and activating the CDK/cyclin complexes. In the present study we show that the human pEg3 kinase is able to specifically phosphorylate CDC25B in vitro. One phosphorylation site was identified and corresponded to serine 323. This residue is equivalent to serine 216 in human CDC25C which plays an important role in the regulation of phosphatase during the cell cycle and at the G2 checkpoint. pEg3 is also able to specifically associate with CDC25B in vitro and in vivo. We show that the ectopic expression of active pEg3 in human U2OS cells induces an accumulation of cells in G2. This effect is counteracted by overexpression of CDC25B. Taken together these results suggest that pEg3 is a potential regulator of the G2/M progression and may act antagonistically to the CDC25B phosphatase."

The X-linked form is due to mutations in the DKC1 gene encoding dyskerin, a nucleolar protein predicted to be involved in rRNA processing and associated with the telomerase complex. Available evidence suggests the pathology of DC is due to telomerase defects. We have used the inducible Cre/loxP system to produce deletions in the murine Dkc1 gene in early embryogenesis. A large deletion lacking exons 12-15 and a small deletion lacking only the last exon, were produced. We found both deletions showed a parent-of-origin effect with 100% embryonic lethality when the mutation occurred on the maternal Dkc1. Embryonic analysis at day E7.5 and E9.5 showed no male embryos carrying either deletion whereas females with maternally derived deletions died around day E9.5, with degeneration of the extra embryonic tissue, in which the paternal X-chromosome is inactivated. Female mice carrying the deletion in the paternally derived Dkc1 show extreme skewing of X-inactivation with the wild type X-chromosome active in all cells. Since mice with no telomerase are viable in the first generations the lethality we observe is unlikely to be due to the effects of mutated dyskerin on telomerase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2081736214,"Mitogenic stimulation leads to activation of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which phosphorylate pocket proteins and trigger progression through the G0/G1 and G1/S transitions of the cell cycle. However, the individual role of G1 cyclin-CDK complexes in the coordinated regulation of pocket proteins and their interaction with E2F family members is not fully understood. Here we report that individually or in concert cyclin D1-CDK and cyclin E-CDK complexes induce distinct and coordinated phosphorylation of endogenous pocket proteins, which also has distinct consequences in the regulation of pocket protein interactions with E2F4 and the expression of p107 and E2F1, both E2F-regulated genes. The up-regulation of these two proteins and the release of p130 and pRB from E2F4 complexes allows formation of E2F1 complexes not only with pRB but also with p130 and p107 as well as the formation of p107-E2F4 complexes. The formation of these complexes occurs in the presence of active cyclin D1-CDK and cyclin E-CDK complexes, indicating that whereas phosphorylation plays a role in the abrogation of certain pocket protein/E2F interactions, these same activities induce the formation of other complexes in the context of a cell expressing endogenous levels of pocket and E2F proteins. Of note, phosphorylated p130 “form 3,” which does not interact with E2F4, readily interacts with E2F1. Our data also demonstrate that ectopic overexpression of either cyclin is sufficient to induce mitogen-independent growth in human T98G and Rat-1 cells, although the effects of cyclin D1 require downstream activation of cyclin E-CDK2 activity. Interestingly, in T98G cells, cyclin D1 induces cell cycle progression more potently than cyclin E.

Ectopic expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E in primary or immortal, nontransformed mammalian fibroblasts shortens the G1 phase of the cell cycle (15Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y.

The relatively modest effects of ectopic expression of G1 cyclins in primary or immortal, nontransformed mammalian fibroblasts are probably due to a requirement for additional events to ensure full activation of these complexes. Whereas cyclins are limiting subunits for activation of their corresponding CDKs, full activation of cyclin-CDK complexes requires other events also dependent upon mitogenic stimulation (reviewed in Refs. 18Graña X. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar, 19Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar, 20Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar). In agreement with this idea, microinjection of purified recombinant active cyclin D1-CDK4 or cyclin E-CDK2 complexes in human primary lung fibroblasts bypasses the requirement for mitogenic signaling (21Connell-Crowley L. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 65-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that cyclin D1-CDK effects trigger pRB inactivation and activation of E2F-dependent genes including cyclin E (21Connell-Crowley L. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 65-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), whereas cyclin E-CDK2 effects might be independent of E2F (22Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K. Reed S.I. Bartek J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 23Leng X. Connell-Crowley L. Goodrich D. Harper J.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Initial studies suggested that pRB was the only substrate of D-type cyclin-CDKs required for a p16-mediated G1 arrest (24Lukas J. Parry D. Aagaard L. Mann D.J. Bartkova J. Strauss M. Peters G. Bartek J. Nature. 1995; 375: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 25Koh J. Enders G.H. Dynlacht B.D. Harlow E. Nature. 1995; 375: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 26Medema R.H. Herrera R.E. Lam F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6289-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies demonstrated that, similar to the lack of pRB, lack of both p130 and p107 also prevents a p16-mediated G1 arrest in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts, strongly suggesting that the three pocket proteins are important substrates for the cell cycle-regulatory functions of D-type cyclin-CDKs. Supporting this hypothesis further, it has been shown that both p130 and p107 are phosphorylated in vivo by d-type cyclin-CDK complexes at specific residues, which are not phosphorylated by cyclin E-CDK2 complexes (27Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28Leng X. Noble M. Adams P.D. Qin J. Harper J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2242-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these sites modulates the growth suppressor activities of p130 and p107. It is likely that two parallel pathways, one controlled by pRB and the other by p130/p107, regulate distinct downstream events required for G1progression into S phase. In agreement with this possibility, different sets of E2F-dependent genes are deregulated in mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking pRB and mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking both p130 and p107 (29Hurford R.K. Cobrinik D. Lee M.H. Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1447-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). It is currently thought that pRB interacts with E2F1, E2F2, E2F3, and E2F4, whereas p130 and p107 interact with E2F4 but not with E2F1–3 (reviewed in Refs. 14Graña X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar and 30Mayol X. Graña X. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 11-24PubMed Google Scholar). The unique ability of pRB to specifically interact with E2F1–3 supports the hypothesis that pRB controls a pathway, which is different from the pathway controlled by p130/p107. Although it seems clear that cells will synthesize DNA when a certain threshold of cyclin D-CDK or cyclin E-CDK2 activity is induced in a cell, the concerted, as well as individual, effects of G1cyclin-CDK activities on the coordinated phosphorylation of the three endogenous pocket proteins and the subsequent effects on E2F-dependent gene expression are not well understood. To address these questions in more detail, we have studied the downstream events induced by both cyclin D1 and cyclin E and their dependence on each other in human T98G and Rat-1 cells. Both cyclins are sufficient to induce mitogenic independent growth. The effects of both cyclins in endogenous pocket protein phosphorylation are clearly distinct. Phosphorylation of certain pocket proteins is sufficient to disrupt, at least partially, a subset of pocket protein-E2F complexes. However, because of the cell cycle-coordinated expression of endogenous members of the pocket protein and E2F families, new pocket protein-E2F complexes are formed even in the presence of active G1CDKs. Surprisingly, we have found that both p130 and p107 specifically interact with E2F1 in a cell cycle-dependent manner. This work demonstrates that the interactions between pocket proteins and E2F family members are more complex than hereto anticipated and suggests cross-talk between these pathways. T98G and Rat-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells were synchronized in G0 phase by contact inhibition followed by serum starvation. Briefly, cells were grown and kept overconfluent for 2 days. Cells were then trypsinized, counted, and seeded at 2 × 106 cells/plate in 100-mm dishes in MCDB-105 medium without FBS (Sigma). After 12 h, medium was removed, and fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without FBS was added. Cells were kept for another 60 h before starting experiments. Roscovitine was used to specifically inhibit CDK2 activity in cells infected with cyclin D1 adenoviruses. Infections were performed in the presence of either the CDK2/CDC2 inhibitor roscovitine (31Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P.J. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Eur. J. Biochemistry. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 25 μm, or vehicle (Me2SO). For G2/M blockage and release experiments, serum-starved T98G cells restimulated with 10% FBS or infected with the indicated adenovirus for 22 h were incubated in the presence or absence of nocodazole (10 μm) for an additional 22 h. When indicated, G2/M-synchronized cells were shaken off as previously described (32Mayol X. Garriga J. Graña X. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 237-246PubMed Google Scholar) and then reseeded in fresh medium. Cells were collected at the time points indicated under “Results” and processed for flow cytometric and/or Western blot analysis. Anti-p107 (sc-318), anti-p21 (sc-397), anti-p27 (sc-528), anti-cyclin A (sc-596), anti-Cdk2 (sc-163), anti-E2F1 (sc-193), and anti-E2F4 (sc-512) rabbit polyclonal antibodies and anti-cyclin D1 (sc-8396), anti-cyclin E (sc-247 and sc-248), and anti-E2F1 KH95 (sc-251) mouse monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-p130 monoclonal antibody (R27020) was from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-p16 monoclonal antibody (G175–405) was from Pharmingen. Anti-pRb was a mix of monoclonal antibodies (XZ35, XZ56, XZ61, XZ91, XZ105, XZ121, XZ133, and XZ145), which were provided by E. Harlow. Recombinant adenoviruses encoding cyclin D1 and cyclin E (Ad-Cyc D1 and Ad-Cyc E) were provided by J. Albrecht (33Albrecht J.H. Hansen L.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar). Adenoviruses encoding p16 (Ad-p16) were provided by J. Fueyo. Adenoviruses encoding p21 (Ad-p21) were provided by W. El-Deiry. Adenoviruses encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (Ad-EGFP) were a gift of P. Ruiz. Viral stocks were amplified using 293 cells and were purified by using CsCl density gradient centrifugation. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay (34Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Titers obtained ranged from 5 × 109 to 5 × 1010 plaque-forming units/ml. Infection conditions and optimal multiplicity of infection were previously determined using adenovirus-carrying reporter genes (lacZ, EGFP). T98G and Rat-1 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 50–100 plaque-forming units/cell and 20 plaque-forming units/cell, respectively, for each adenovirus used. Infections were carried out by direct addition of the necessary volume of adenovirus stock to the medium. Whole protein lysates were obtained essentially as described previously (12Mayol X. Garriga J. Graña X. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 801-808PubMed Google Scholar,35Garriga J. Limon A. Mayol X. Rane S.G. Albrecht J.H. Reddy E.P. Andrés V. Graña X. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) by lysing cells in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mmNaF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 4 μg/ml pepstatin (lysis buffer). For cyclin D1 kinase assays and certain immunoprecipitations, we used DIP buffer (36Reed M.F. Liu V.F. Ladha M.H. Ando K. Griffin J.D. Weaver D.T. Ewen M.E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2961-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (see below). Immunoprecipitations and Western blots were performed as previously described (12Mayol X. Garriga J. Graña X. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 801-808PubMed Google Scholar, 35Garriga J. Limon A. Mayol X. Rane S.G. Albrecht J.H. Reddy E.P. Andrés V. Graña X. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein extracts (250–500 μg) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with specific antibodies, and immunocomplexes were precipitated with 25 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C and washed four times. Complexes were eluted from beads by adding 1.5 × Laemmli sample buffer. Whole cell lysates or immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp.) in 10 mm CAPS (pH 11) containing 10% methanol. 10 and 12% gels were run to determine the expression of cyclins, p16, p21, p27, and E2F proteins; and 6 and 8% gels to determine the phosphorylation status of pocket proteins. The transferred membranes were probed with specific primary antibodies and the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were visualized by incubating the membranes with Enhanced Chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposing the membranes to x-ray film. CDK2 kinase activity was determined from CDK2, cyclin E, and cyclin A immunopurified complexes as described previously (37Graña X., De Luca A. Sang N., Fu, Y. Claudio P.P. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. Giordano A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3834-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 38Garriga J. Segura E. Mayol X. Grubmeyer C. Graña X. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Complexes were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies from whole protein extracts (40 μg for CDK2 and 200 μg for cyclin E). Kinase assays were performed at 30 °C for 30 min in 20 mm HEPES-Na (pH 7.4), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP (10 μCi/reaction), and 1 μg of substrate (histone H1). CycD1 kinase activity was determined as described (36Reed M.F. Liu V.F. Ladha M.H. Ando K. Griffin J.D. Weaver D.T. Ewen M.E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2961-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in DIP buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing freshly added 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Active complexes were immunoprecipitated from 800 μg of cell lysate by using CycD1 monoclonal antibodies, collected with protein A-Sepharose (30 μl of 50% slurry containing beads preequilibrated in DIP with 4% bovine serum albumin), and washed four times with DIP buffer containing fresh inhibitors and two additional times with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, and freshly added 1 mm dithiothreitol). Kinase assays were performed at 30 °C for 30 min in kinase buffer containing 20 μm ATP (10 μCi/reaction) and 1 μg of substrate (GST-pRb C terminus). In all cases, reactions were stopped by adding 1 volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and boiling samples for 10 min. Substrates were resolved in 12% SDS-PAGE, and gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. All measurements were performed on a FACScan (BD Pharmingen). For DNA content quantification, cells were processed as described earlier (12Mayol X. Garriga J. Graña X. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 801-808PubMed Google Scholar). For the cell proliferation assay, cells were plated (see above) in serum-free medium, and 24 h later cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with 20 μm carboxymethyl fluorescein diacetate succinyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature. CFSE incorporation was stopped by washing once with 10% FBS-containing medium and two additional times with serum-free medium. At time points indicated, cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1% FBS-containing phosphate-buffered saline, and green fluorescence was quantified. Data from 10,000 cells were collected and analyzed using ModFitLT version 2.0 software. We were interested in determining the effects that expression of G1 cyclins have on the phosphorylation status of endogenous pocket proteins and the subsequent effects on pocket protein-E2F complexes, expression of E2F-dependent and independent gene products, and, ultimately, entry and progression throughout the cell cycle. To this end, we chose an immortal human cell line (T98G cells), which has been extensively used in cell cycle studies. We also used the rat embryo fibroblast cell line Rat-1. Both T98G and Rat-1 cells are effectively arrested in a quiescent state by serum starvation, and subsequent mitogenic stimulation leads to synchronous cell cycle entry. To ectopically express G1 cyclins and cyclin kinase inhibitors, we utilized replication-defective recombinant adenoviruses. Under our experimental conditions, virtually all cells are transduced by the recombinant adenoviruses at multiplicity of infection values of 50–100 as estimated by using recombinant adenoviruses encoding the green fluorescent protein and β-galactosidase (data not shown). Initial experiments demonstrated that transduction of serum-starved T98G cells with recombinant adenoviruses encoding cyclins D1 (Ad-Cyc D1) or E (Ad-Cyc E), but not β-galactosidase control adenoviruses (Ad-β-gal), for 48 h was sufficient to induce cell cycle entry in the absence of any mitogenic stimuli as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis following propidium iodide staining (data not shown; see below). This was also confirmed using Rat-1 cells. To determine the effects of ectopic expression of cyclin D1 and E alone or combined on cell cycle entry, T98G cells were serum-starved for 2 days and then stimulated with FBS or infected with the indicated recombinant adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 50 (Fig. 1). Cells were harvested at the indicated time points and processed for fluorescence-activated cell sorting and Western blot analysis. The expression of the ectopically expressed cyclins is shown in Fig. 1 A. Cells maintained in the absence of serum did not show changes in cell cycle distribution (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were obtained with cells transduced with the β-galactosidase control adenovirus in the absence of serum (data not shown; see below). As expected, stimulation with 10% FBS led to synchronous cell cycle entry. More than 40% of the cells were in S phase by 22 h, and by 30 h most cells were in the next G1 phase following mitosis (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, ectopic expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E individually or together led to synchronous cell cycle entry and progression throughout S phase. Cyclin D1 appeared more potent in inducing cell cycle progression than cyclin E (comparepanels 3 and 4). Moreover, when both cyclins were coexpressed, the kinetics of cell cycle progression were very similar to that induced by cyclin D1 alone (comparepanels 3 and 5). To determine whether the expression of cyclins D1 and E alone or combined was able to induce changes in the patterns of phosphorylation of pocket proteins similar to those changes induced by stimulation with FBS, we resolved protein extracts by 6% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with specific antibodies. Fig. 1 C shows that expression of both cyclins appears sufficient to induce hyperphosphorylation of the three pocket proteins (see below). p130-phosphorylated forms found in quiescent T98G cells consist of forms 1 and 2 (12Mayol X. Garriga J. Graña X. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 801-808PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mayol X. Garriga J. Graña X. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 237-246PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation with FBS triggers phosphorylation of p130 to form 3 in mid-G1 (8–10 h in T98G cells) (Fig. 1 C,panel 2) (12Mayol X. Garriga J. Graña X. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 801-808PubMed Google Scholar). p107 is expressed at low levels, and it is found in its hypophosphorylated form in quiescent cells. p107 becomes hyperphosphorylated and expressed at higher levels concomitantly with p130 hyperphosphorylation. pRB also becomes hyperphosphorylated in mid-G1. (Note that the anti-pRB mixture of monoclonal antibodies used in this experiment had a preference for the hypophosphorylated form; whereas the appearance of hyperphosphorylated forms is clear, the change in intensity of the different forms does not reflect a change in the expression of pRB.) Ectopic expression of cyclin D1 in the absence of FBS was apparently sufficient to induce the same changes in protein phosphorylation induced by serum stimulation (Fig. 1 C, comparepanels 2 and 3). Of note, cyclin E appeared less effective in inducing changes in pocket protein phosphorylation and cell cycle progression. Finally, coexpression of cyclins D1 and E exhibited the same effects of cyclin D1 alone. The results of this experiment demonstrate that ectopic expression of either cyclin D1 or cyclin E alone is sufficient to bypass the growth factor requirements necessary to trigger hyperphosphorylation of pocket proteins and cell cycle entry in serum-starved quiescent T98G cells. However, because activation of cyclin D1-CDK complexes is likely to lead to activation of endogenous cyclin E-CDK2 complexes and vice versa, we could not discern the individual effects of each cyclin on pocket protein phosphorylation and cell cycle progression. Similar experiments were also performed using Rat-1 cells. The expression of either cyclin D1 or cyclin E was sufficient to trigger phosphorylation of pocket proteins and cell cycle progression in the absence of serum (data not shown). A strategy to induce activation of cyclin D1-CDK complexes in the absence of CDK2 activity or activation of cyclin E-CDK2 complexes in the absence of D-type cyclin-CDK activity was designed. Our strategy consists of transducing serum-starved T98G cells with recombinant adenoviruses expressing either p16 (an inhibitor of D-type cyclin-CDK activity) (39Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3340) Google Scholar), p21 (an assembly factor for D-type cyclin-CDK complexes and a potent inhibitor of cyclin E-CDK2 complexes) (reviewed in Ref. 20Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar), or Ad-β-gal (control). 5 h after transduction, (a) the cells infected with Ad-p16 were infected with Ad-Cyc E, (b) the cells infected with Ad-p21 were infected with Ad-Cyc D1, and (c) the cells infected with Ad-β-gal were infected with Ad-Cyc D1, Ad-Cyc E, or Ad-β-gal. These combinations were predicted to generate both individual and cooperative G1 CDK activities in vivo. To determine whether this was the case, cells were harvested at the indicated time points after transduction with the second group of recombinant adenoviruses (Fig. 2). Whole cell protein lysates were obtained and used to perform kinase assays. Fig. 2 A shows efficient expression of the ectopically expressed proteins, as determined by Western blot analysis. Under the shown exposure times, endogenous cyclin D1 is not detected (see Fig. 1). We determined the kinase activities associated with cyclin D1, cyclin E, and CDK2 by immunoprecipitating the kinase complexes with specific antibodies and performing kinase assays with the immunoprecipitates using the C-terminal domain of pRB and histone H1 as exogenous substrates as indicated in Fig. 2 B. As expected, stimulation of T98G cells with FBS led to up-regulation of cyclin D1-, cyclin E-, and CDK2-associated kinase activities (lanes 1–3). Ectopic expression of cyclin D1 resulted in high levels of cyclin D1-associated kinase activity, which was followed by induction of cyclin E- and CDK2-associated kinase activities (lanes 10 and 11). The differences between cyclin E- and CDK2-associated kinase activities are that the latter consists of cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 activities. Of note, coexpression of cyclin D1 and p21 also leads to induction of cyclin D1-associated kinase activity to levels comparable with those induced by serum stimulation (compare lanes 2 and3 with lanes 12 and 13). However, cyclin D1 kinase activity was lower in cells coexpressing cyclin D1 and p21 than in cells expressing cyclin D1 alone (comparelanes 10 and 11 with lanes 12 and 13). This suggests that p21, when expressed at high levels, inhibits cyclin D1-CDK activity (20Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar). Importantly, cyclin D1 activation in cells coexpressing p21 is not accompanied by activation of cyclin E or CDK2-associated kinase activities (compare lanes 10 and 11with lanes 12 and 13). Thus, cotransfection of cyclin D1 and p21 results in individual activation of cyclin D1-CDK complexes. An independent strategy to activate D-type cyclin-CDK activity in the absence of cyclin E-CDK2 activity consisted of treating cells expressing exogenous cyclin D1 with roscovitine, an inhibitor of CDK2/CDC2 (see below). On the other hand, expression of cyclin E leads to induction of cyclin E and CDK2-associated kinase activities and, to a lesser extent, cyclin D1-associated kinase activity (compare lanes 6and 7 with lanes 4 and 5). Notably, coexpression of cyclin E and p16"

The N-terminal 272 residues of hCyclinT1, including the entire cyclin domains and the Tat·TAR recognition motif (TRM), that fully support Tat transactivation was used for panning, and of the five unique anti-hCyclinT1 sFvs that were obtained, three bound to the cyclin box domains and two bound to TRM. All sFvs could be expressed as intrabodies at high levels in transiently transfected 293T and in stable Jurkat and SupT1 transfectants and could specifically co-immunoprecipitate co-expressed hCyclinT1 in 293T cells with varying efficacy without disrupting hCyclinT1-Cdk9 interactions. In addition, two sFv clones (3R6-1 and 2R6-21) that mapped to the cyclin box domains markedly inhibited Tat-mediated transactivation in several transiently transfected cell lines without inhibiting basal transcription or inducing apoptosis. When HIV-1 challenge studies were performed on stable 3R6-1-expressing Jurkat T cells, near complete inhibition of viral replication was obtained at a low challenge dose, and 74–88% inhibition to HIV-1 replication was achieved at a high infection dose in SupT1 cells. These results provide proof-in-principle that anti-hCyclinT1 intrabodies can be designed to block HIV-1 replication without causing cellular toxicity, and as a result, they may be useful agents for “intracellular immunization”-based gene therapy strategies for HIV-1 infection/AIDS.

In the absence of Tat the transcription of HIV mRNAs can be initiated but cannot be efficiently elongated to produce full-length viral RNA genome (1Emerman M. Malim M.H. Science. 1998; 280: 1880-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Tat interacts specifically with human cyclinT1 (hCyclinT1), a regulatory partner of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9) in the positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb) complex. Tat binds cooperatively with hCyclinT1 to the transactivation response element (TAR), a bulged RNA loop structure located at the 5′-end of nascent viral RNA transcripts to recruit P-TEFb and promote HIV transcription elongation. The assembly of the Tat·TAR·P-TEFb complex to the HIV promoter activates the Cdk9 kinase activities, which further autophosphorylates P-TEFb and hyperphosphorylates the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (2Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), leading to the formation of processive elongation complexes that synthesize full-length HIV viral mRNA. In addition to hCyclinT1 and Cdk9 subunits, the nascent P-TEFb complex also contains hCyclinT2a, T2b, (3Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Gene & Dev. 1998; 12: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and recently described 7SK small nuclear RNAs as well as several other proteins of unknown identity (4Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K.

Among these, only Cdk9/hCyclinT1 heterodimer functions as both a general and an HIV-1 Tat-specific transcription factor (2Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 6Bieniasz P.D. Gridina T.A. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell.

The transactivation mechanism is a particularly attractive target for the development of new anti-retroviral drug therapies, because Tat is required for viral gene expression not only during the exponential growth of the virus, but also, critically, it is required during the activation of the integrated proviral genomes that give rise to drug-resistant strains of HIV-1 (9Karn J. Tackling Tat. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). With the recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of transactivation, it is clear that one novel anti-retroviral strategy that would bypass the ability of HIV-1 to adapt to traditional anti-viral therapies is to develop agents that target hCyclinT1. This would be an attractive target, if it was possible to selectively disrupt Tat-hCylinT1 interactions without disrupting the function of the P-TEFb complex, which is required for basal cellular transcription. Indeed, although hCyclinT1 contains 726 amino acids (see Fig. 1), the N-terminal 272 residues, including the entire cyclin domain (residues 1–250) and a TAR recognition motif (TRM, residues 250–272 of hCyclinT1) fully support the Tat transactivation of HIV-1 LTR (long terminal repeat) (10Fujinaga K. Taube R. Wimmer J. Cujec T.P. Peterlin B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal 300 amino acids (residues 402–701) are believed to mediate the coupling of general transcription elongation and pre-mRNA splicing (11Fong Y.W. Zhou Q. Nature. 2001; 414: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In previous studies we have demonstrated that an intrabody to HIV-1 Tat could significantly inhibit HIV-1 replication in vitro (12Mhashilkar A. Bagley J. Chen S.Y. Szilvary A.M. Helland D.G. Marasco W.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1542-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,13Marasco W.A. LaVecchio J. Winkler A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 231: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) indicating that the Tat transactivation pathway could be targeted by intrabodies specific for the viral component of this pathway. Based on these studies, we further hypothesized that, because the molecular interaction between HIV-1 Tat and the N-terminal region of hCyclinT1 is necessary for HIV-1 replication, the selective disruption of this binding by anti-hCyclinT1 intrabodies could inhibit Tat-mediated transactivation and HIV-1 replication without having a detrimental effect on basal transcription. To test this hypothesis, we used the N-terminal region of hCyclinT1 and a synthetic TRM peptide to screen a very large non-immune human single-chain antibody (sFv) phage display library to identify sFvs that could be engineered as anti-hCyclinT1 intrabodies. Of the five hCyclinT1-specific single chain antibody (sFv) clones that were identified, one sFv (3R6-1) not only disrupted the molecular interaction between Tat and hCyclinT1 in co-transfected human CD4+ T cell lines but also inhibited HIV-1 replication upon viral challenge. Importantly, no disruption of basal cellular transcription was observed. These results provide proof-in-principle that anti-hCyclinT1 intrabodies can be designed to selectively block Tat-mediated transactivation and HIV-1 replication. They may also provide a promising new agent for the gene therapy of HIV-1 infection. Anti-M13 monoclonal antibody (mAb) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Goat anti-human cyclinT1, rabbit anti-human Cdk9, rabbit anti-HA, rabbit anti-His, and goat anti-HA IgG-beads were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and HRP-conjugated mouse anti-goat IgG were purchased from Pierce (Rockford). Prokaryotic expression vectors pGST-hT1–250 and pGST-hT1–300 for producing truncated hCyclinT1-GST fusion proteins were kindly provided by Dr. Peterlin (10Fujinaga K. Taube R. Wimmer J. Cujec T.P. Peterlin B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To express GST-full-length hCyclinT1 fusion protein, the hCyclinT1 gene amplified by PCR with built-in BamHI andEcoRI sites was inserted into pGEX-2T (AmershamBiosciences), resulting in pGST-hT1–726. PGST-hT1–200 was created by digesting pGST-hT1–726 with EcoRI and BsmI followed by blunt-end ligation to remove amino acids 202–726 in hCyclinT1 (see Fig. 3 A). The eukaryotic expression vector for hCyclinT1 (pCI-86) was provided by Dr. Jones (8Wei X. Ghosh S.K. Taylor M.E. Johnson V.A. Emini E.A. Deutsch P. Lifson J.D. Bonhoeffer S. Nowak M.A. Hahn B. Saag M.S. Shaw G.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar). PCI-86(His) vector for expressing C-terminally His-tagged hCyclinT1 was constructed by replacing the original C-terminal BstBI/NotI fragment with a similar PCR-modified fragment containing sequence coding for six histidines. For expressing soluble sFvs in bacterial cells, sFv coding sequences were isolated from the pFarber phage display vector by NcoI and NotI digestion and inserted into the pSyn1 vector in the same orientation. The sFvs expressed in bacterial cells were C-terminally tagged with c-myc and His6 (Fig. 2 A). For expressing sFv intrabodies in mammalian cells, the sFv coding sequences were released from pFarber phage display vectors by SfiI and NotI digestion and ligated into an sFv expression cassette in psFv-Cκ-HA (Fig. 5 A).Figure 5The expression of anti-hCyclinT1 intrabodies in mammalian cells. A, eukaryotic vectors (psFv-Cκ-HA) for expressing anti-hCycinT1 intrabodies. SFv inserts from the pFarber phage display vector were isolated by SfiI andNotI digestion and ligated into the vector to create sFvs that are fused to the human Ig κ chain constant region to increase intracellular folding and binding affinity (23Ho D.D. Neumann A.U. Perelson A.S. Chen W. Leonard J.M. Markowitz M. Nature. 1995; 373: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (3810) Google Scholar). B, anti-hCyclinT1 intrabody expression vectors were transfected into 293T cells by using Qiagen Polyfect reagent and 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH.7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysates (20 μl) were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with rabbit anti-HA primary antibody and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. The sFv fusion proteins are ∼43 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Single colonies of transformed XL1-blue bacteria were cultured at 37 °C overnight in 10 ml of 2xYT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of fresh medium followed by shaking for 3–5 h until 0.3–0.5 A 600 nm was achieved. Subsequently, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added at 0.5 mm to induce the expression of GST fusion proteins at 30 °C with vigorous shaking for 3–5 h. The bacterial pellets were resuspended in 50 ml of cold PBS containing protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and sonicated for 3 min in an ice bath. After centrifugation, the clear protein supernatants were mixed with pre-washed glutathione-Sepharose beads for 30 min. The column bed was then washed in cold PBS, and GST fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione solution and stored at 4 °C for ELISA assay or immunoprecipitation. For the isolation of GST-free hCyclinT1–200, -250, and -300 polypeptides, 1 ml of thrombin/PBS was added to the Sepharose bed. Cleaved hCyclinT1 polypeptides were collected by draining the column and washing with PBS. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. To purify His-tagged sFvs, bacterial cultures were processed as described above. Supernatants of cell lysates were clarified through a syringe filter. Proteins from 1 liter of culture were precipitated in 50% saturated ammonium sulfate and dissolved in 10 ml of PBS buffer containing 10 mm imidazole before being loaded onto a nickel-bound chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). After washing with 20–200 mm imidazole in PBS buffer, His tag-bound proteins were eluted with PBS containing 300 mmimidazole. Construction of the pFarber phagemid display vector and characterization of a 15-billion member non-immune human sFv phage display library will be described elsewhere. 2S. Mehta, Y. Wang, A.

Phage particles displaying human sFv molecules from TG1 Escherichia coli host cells by VCS M13 helper phage and concentrated by PEG/NaCl precipitation and diluted to 1012–13plaque-forming units/ml before screening (14Hoogenboom H.R.

To identify sFv clones that specifically bind to epitopes in the N-terminal region of hCyclinT1 that are involved in Tat transactivation, the phage display library containing 1012plaque-forming units was panned against affinity-purified GST-free hCyclinT1–300-coated Maxisorb immunotubes (20 μg/ml, Nalge Nunc International (15Winter G. Griffiths A.D. Hawkins R.E. Hoogenboom H.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 433-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, 16Harrison J.L. Williams S.C. Winter G. Nissim A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 83-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) for three successive rounds. After extensive washing with 0.1% Tween-20/PBS, bound phages were eluted with 100 mm triethylamine for 30 and 60 min. Pooled samples were used for rescue and further panning. After the last round of selection, selected sFv phages were diluted and used to infect TG1 E. coli strain. Culture medium containing sFv phage particles rescued from individual colonies in 24-well plates were submitted for ELISA screening. To identify TRM-specific sFvs, a biotin-labeled TRM peptide (NRLKRIWNWRACEAAKKGGK-biotin) was synthesized for screening the library from 200 to 2 ng concentration. Peptide-bound phages were trapped by streptavidin Immunobeads and eluted with 0.1m HCl-glycine (pH 2.2) for 30 and 60 min. Individual clones rescued from rounds 3–7 were further analyzed by ELISA screening. 96-well microtiter plates were coated with purified GST-hCyclinT1–726 protein (10 μg/ml) followed by incubation with sFv phage particles (1010 plaque-forming units). The binding activity of anti-hCyclinT1 sFv phages to the antigens was determined by incubation with anti-M13 monoclonal antibodies and goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP. Positive samples were further tested with GST-coated plates to remove GST-specific sFv binders. VCS M13 helper phage stocks with a similar number of virus particles were used as negative control. SFv clones from peptide panning were screened on streptavidin-coated microtiter plates followed by incubation with biotin-TRM peptide and then with sFv phage particles. TRM-positive binders were further tested with purified hCyclinT1 as described above. The binding affinity and kinetic profiles of isolated anti-hCyclinT1 sFvs to hCyclinT1 were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance on the Biacore 1000 apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). The flow cells of a CM5 sensor chip was tested under three different pH conditions. The GST-free hCyclinT1–300 could not be efficiently immobilized to the CM5 sensor chips under neutral (5 mm maleate, pH 6.0–7.0) or acidic pH conditions (10 mm acetate, pH 4.8); however, the sensor chips were effectively coupled with GST-hCyclinT1–300 (20 μg/ml) at pH 4.8 in the presence of 10 mm acetate. The level of immobilization was 24 ng of protein/mm2 surface, equivalent to 24,000 relative units/mm2 over background. Binding kinetic parameters for individual sFv clones were measured with His tag-purified sFv proteins at different concentrations. 2R6-21 and 3R6-1 were measured at 6.6, 33, 165, 330, and 660 nm, whereas 2R6-113 was measured at 330, 825, 1650, and 3300 nm. Association (K on) and dissociation (K off) constants of sFvs to hCyclinT1 were calculated with Biacore evaluation software based on simulated binding curves of actual measurements. Human Jurkat and SupT1 cell lines (ARRRP-NIH) were cultured in RPMI 1640 growth medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units of penicillin and streptomycin. To establish T cell transfectants that stably expressed anti-hCyclinT1 intrabodies for HIV-1 challenge, Jurkat and SupT1 cells were split 48 h prior to DNA transfection, washed in PBS, and then diluted to 3 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 growth medium. The diluted cells (1 ml) were gently mixed with ScaI-linearized psFv-Cκ-HA (8 μg) and transferred to a sterile chamber followed by electroporation. The transfected cells were cultured at 37 °C for 48 h to allow cells to recover, and, subsequently, the cells were selected in growth medium containing G418 (1 mg/ml) for 3 weeks to derive G418-resistant cells. Bulk populations of stably transfected Jurkat and SupT cells in log phase of growth were harvested and washed in PBS. Subsequently, 5 × 105 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of growth medium containing 50 or 2500 TCID50 infection units of HIV-1 IIIB virus (17Popovic M. Sarngadharan M.G. Read E. Gallo R.C. Science. 1984; 224: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (2574) Google Scholar). After 2-h incubation at 37 °C, infected cells were washed in serum-free medium twice and were cultured in duplicate 6-well dishes for 3 weeks. Culture medium (1 ml) was collected at intervals of 2–3 days and frozen at −70 °C for p24 assay. The concentration of HIV-1 core protein antigen in culture medium was measured by using a p24 immunoassay from Coulter Corp. (Westbrook, ME). The results were read on a Dynatech MR5000 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate reader (Dynatech Laboratories Inc., Chantilly, VA). Medium samples were first tested without dilution. Samples that gave optical density readings of more than 1.0 were diluted at 1:10, 1:102, 1:103, 1:104, and 1:105 and were re-assayed. To identify hCyclinT1-specific sFvs, the affinity-purified hCyclinT1 polypeptide (hCyclinT1–300) was used to coat immunotubes for screening the phage display library. The bait protein contained the N-terminal region 300 amino acids of hCyclinT1 that participates in Tat transactivation (Fig. 1). After three rounds of selection, individual colonies were tested by phage ELISA against purified GST-hCyclinT1–300 and GST. Approximately 80% colonies from the third round of panning were positive for hCyclinT1, and only 1 of 200 colonies reacted to GST. DNA sequence analysis of 50 binders positive for hCyclinT1 identified one unique sFv clone (3R6-1). To identify more diversified anti-hCyclinT1 sFv clones, phages from the second round of panning were used for ELISA screening. In addition to 3R6-1, two more sFv clones, 2R6-21 and 2R6-113, were identified. 3R6-1 and 2R6-21 clones predominated in the phage populations of the second round of selection, whereas 2R6-113 represented a small proportion (2%) of the positive binders. The TRM motif of hCyclinT1 contains a cysteine residue (Cys-261) that has been shown to be critical for Tat and hCyclinT1 interaction (Fig. 1) (18Garber M.E. Wei P. KewalRamani V.N. Mayall T.P. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. Littman D.R. Jones K.A. Genes & Dev. 1998; 12: 3512-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To identify TRM-specific sFvs, immunotubes were coated with the synthetic 20-mer peptide and one clone (PS11) was isolated after the second round of selection. When the same peptide was used for liquid phase selection with streptavidin beads, one additional sFv clone (S84) was isolated after seven rounds of panning. TableI shows the comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of the five hCyclinT1-specific sFv clones. It is noteworthy that 3R6-1 and 2R6-21 share identical heavy chains, but have 13 amino acid differences in their light chains. These variations are mainly located in FW1 (PCR primer annealing region) and FW4 (different Jλ segments) of VL with one amino acid substitution in CDR2 and two substitutions in CDR3 that might account for their differential binding affinities in vitro and in mammalian cells described below. In addition, although PS11 and S84 were specific to the TRM motif, their amino acid sequences were very different.Table IHeavy and light chain regionsHeavy chain variable regionboth1 FW1 CDR1 FW2 CDR2 FW3 CDR3 FW4 1213R6-1MAQVQLVQSGGGLVQPGRSLRLSCAASGFTFDDYAMHWVRQAPGKGLEWVSGISWNSGSIGYADSVKGRFTISRDNTKNTVYLQMNSLRAADTAVYYCVRALLDQWGGDYWGQGTLVTVSS2R6-21.........................................................................................................................S84...............................SSH................AV..YDGSNKY.............................E.........DFGGVA.T.Y...........2R6-113..............K..G......K...E..S..Y.S.............AT.KPDGNEKY.V............

To characterize the biochemical and binding properties of the anti-hCyclinT1 sFvs, the sFv coding sequences were subcloned into the pSyn1 bacterial expression vector to produce soluble 30-kDa sFv proteins that contain C-terminal c-myc followed by a His (x6) tag (Fig. 2 A). Fig. 2 B shows SDS-PAGE analysis of the sFv proteins purified from XL1-blue E. coli bacteria using nickel-chelating Sepharose columns. Purified GST fusion proteins containing different-length N-terminal hCyclinT1 amino acids or GST alone were used to coat microtiter plates to determine sFv binding epitopes on hCyclinT1 (Fig. 3 A). To avoid nonspecific binding activity, the sFv concentrations used in these studies were first pre-determined by testing the serially diluted purified sFvs against a fixed amount of GST-free hCyclinT1–300, and then the sFvs were tested for binding at low concentrations above the end point of their binding activity (refer to Fig. 3 C). As shown in Fig. 3 B, the five sFvs bound specifically to GST-hCyclinT1 fusion proteins but not to GST. SFv 3R6-1, 2R6-21, and 2R6-113 bound strongly to GST-T1–200, GST-T1–250, and GST-T1–300, indicating that the epitopes for these sFvs were located within the cyclin box domains of the N-terminal 200 amino acids. Although the sFv 3R6-1 and 2R6-21 have identical VH chains and closely related light chains, there was a 2-fold higher binding signal for 3R6-1 compared with 2R6-21 when tested at 0.05 μg/ml sFv protein that reflects a difference in binding affinities for the two sFvs under these assay conditions. PS11 displayed stronger binding activity to GST-T1–300 than to GST-T1–250 as expected, because the TRM peptide used for panning corresponded to amino acids 250–266 of hCyclinT1. However, S84 showed only weak binding activity to GST-T1–300 and similarly cross-reacted with GST-T1–250 as well, indicating that a TRM-like epitope may be present in residues 200–250 of hCyclinT1. To further characterize the binding profiles of the anti-hCyclinT1 sFvs, microtiter plates were coated with purified GST-free hCyclinT1–300 (20 μg/ml, equivalent to 660 nm), and the purified sFvs were tested for binding activity over the 0.033–1320 nm range (equivalent to 0.001–40 μg/ml). As shown in Fig. 3 C, the 2R6-21 and 3R6-1 clones yielded the strongest binding activities to purified hCyclinT1 with detectable binding at concentrations as low as 0.16 nm. Clones 2R6-113 and PS11 had similar binding profiles, however, their binding end points to hCyclinT1 were about 3.33 nm and were much higher than those seen for clones 2R6-21 and 3R6-1. Clone S84 had the lowest end point binding activity (82.5 nm) to the purified hCyclinT1. In addition, only the binding of sFv S84 and PS11, but not sFv 3R6-1, 2R6-21, or 2R6-113, to hCyclinT1–300 could be specifically blocked by the TRM peptide used for their selection in an ELISA-based peptide-blocking assay. As expected, a higher concentration of TRM peptide was required to compete for sFv PS11 compared with sFv S84 binding, which is most likely due to the relatively higher binding affinity of sFv PS11 to hCyclinT1–300 (data not shown). To more accurately characterize the binding affinities of these sFvs to hCyclinT1, real-time Biacore analysis was performed and the association (K on) and dissociation (K off) constants for anti-hCyclinT1 sFv binding to hCyclinT1–300 were experimentally determined. TableII summarizes the results for the real-time Biacore analyses. The binding affinity of sFv 2R6-21 (K D = 6.95 × 10−8m) was 1.5-fold higher than 3R6-1 (K D = 1.07 × 10−7m) and 11-fold higher than 2R6-113 (K D = 7.94 × 10−7m). Because 2R6-21 and 3R6-1 share identical heavy chains, this result is consistent with the known finding that the majority of binding energy is often supplied by VH CDR3 and different VLchains can variably contribute to the overall energy of binding. Although S84 gave rise to positive binding signals at 82.5–660 nm concentrations in ELISA (Fig. 3 C), it only showed background binding to hCyclinT1 in the Biacore assay even at much higher concentrations (330–3300 nm, data not shown), indicating that the Biacore assay had lower sensitivity than the ELISA assay. The binding parameters for PS11 were not measured using Biacore, however, the ELISA binding profile for PS11 is similar to that for sFv 2R6-113, suggesting that these two sFvs have similar binding affinities. Taken together, the binding affinity rank for these five anti-hCyclinT1 sFvs was determined to be 2R6-21 > 3R6-1 > 2R6-113 ≅ PS11 ≫ S84.Table IIAffinity binding constants"

Based on previous studies with ypt6 deletion mutants, a regulatory role of the GTPase either in protein retrieval to the trans-Golgi network or in forward transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and early Golgi compartments was proposed. To assess better the primary role(s) of Ypt6p, temperature-sensitive ypt6 mutants were generated and analyzed biochemically and genetically. Defects inN-glycosylation of proteins passing the Golgi and of Golgi-resident glycosyltransferases as well as protein sorting defects in the trans-Golgi were recorded shortly after functional loss of Ypt6p. ER-to-Golgi transport and protein secretion were delayed but not interrupted. Mis-sorting of the vesicular SNARE Sec22p to the late Golgi was also observed. Combination of theypt6-2 mutant allele with a number of mutants in forward and retrograde transport between ER, Golgi, and endosomes led to synthetic negative growth defects.

Generation of transport vesicles at different donor compartments and their fusion with defined target membranes follow general principles and require protein machines made up of related and evolutionarily conserved proteins that are, however, specific for each transport step (1Jahn R.

Among the proteins that confer specificity and directionality to vesicular trafficking are Ras-like GTPases of the Ypt/Rab family (3Lazar T. Gotte M. Gallwitz D. Trends Biochem.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this GTPase family has 11 members of which only those that act in forward transport through the secretory pathway (Ypt1p, Sec4p, and the pair of apparently redundant Ypt31/Ypt32-GTPases) are essential for cell viability (3Lazar T. Gotte M. Gallwitz D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 468-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Of the nonessential ones, Ypt6p, the homologue of the mammalian Rab6 GTPases, has been implicated in having a role in the retrieval of proteins from endosomes to thetrans-Golgi network (7Tsukada M.

Such mutants were found to be growth-inhibited at elevated temperature, to partially mis-sort proteins in thetrans-Golgi network already at permissive temperature, and to moderately interfere with protein secretion at nonpermissive conditions (7Tsukada M. Gallwitz D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2471-2481PubMed Google Scholar, 11Li B. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16813-16819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Temperature sensitivity of ypt6 deletion mutants allowed us to isolate multicopy suppressors of which one,SYS1 (7Tsukada M. Gallwitz D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2471-2481PubMed Google Scholar), could also rescue another protein mis-sorting mutant, ricΔ (9Bensen E.S. Yeung B.G. Payne G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), later shown to be defective in the nucleotide exchange factor for Ypt6p (13Siniossoglou S. Peak-Chew S.Y. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4885-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cells lacking Ypt6p accumulate transport vesicles (8Tsukada M. Will E. Gallwitz D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) of which at least a fraction may be derived from endosomes and destined to fuse with late Golgi membranes (10Siniossoglou S. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5991-5998Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). On the other hand, temperature-sensitive growth ofypt6 deletion mutants can be overcome efficiently by raising the intracellular level of Ypt1p (12Li B. Warner J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the GTPase required for ER1-to-Golgi (14Cao X. Ballew N. Barlowe C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2156-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and early Golgi transport (15Jedd G. Richardson C. Litt R. Segev N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Furthermore, partial suppression of growth defects of ypt6 and ric1 null mutants by high expression of a variety of genes that are known to act in either forward or retrograde Golgi transport have led to the assumption that Ypt6p might participate in regulating more than one transport step (9Bensen E.S. Yeung B.G. Payne G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This would in fact mirror the situation in mammalian cells where the homologue of yeast Ypt6p, Rab6, initially thought to function only inintra-Golgi transport (16Martinez O. Schmidt A. Salamero J. Hoflack B. Roa M. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), is also required for recycling of proteins between endosomes and the TGN (17Mallard F. Tang B.L. Galli T. Tenza D. Saint-Pol A. Yue X. Antony C. Hong W. Goud B. Johannes L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The notable difference, however, is that although yeast has only one form of Ypt6p, mammalian cells are endowed with two Rab6 isoforms that apparently act sequentially in transport from endosomes to the early Golgi (17Mallard F. Tang B.L. Galli T. Tenza D. Saint-Pol A. Yue X. Antony C. Hong W. Goud B. Johannes L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and even to the ER (18White J. Johannes L. Mallard F. Girod A. Grill S. Reinsch S. Keller P. Tzschaschel B. Echard A. Goud B. Stelzer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). As previous studies with ypt6 deletion mutants have the inherent problem that adaptive changes in the physiology of such cells might obscure the true lesions caused by functional loss of the GTPase, we sought to investigate Ypt6p function with the help of conditional mutants. The data obtained from genetic interactions and from experiments following the kinetics of protein transport and sorting as well as the state of protein glycosylation at permissive and nonpermissive conditions are best explained by Ypt6p acting both in recycling of proteins from endosomes to the Golgi and from late to early Golgi compartments. Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Yeast transformations, mating, sporulation, and tetrad analyses were performed using standard techniques (19Gietz D., St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar, 20Sherman F. Hicks J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). c-Myc epitope tagging of ORFs was performed as described previously (21De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 246: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To produce pKS-YPT6-URA3 for site-directed mutagenesis, the 1.4-kb XbaIYPT6 gene fragment from pRS315-YPT6 was inserted into theXbaI site of pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). The HindIII URA3 gene fragment from YEp24 (New England Biolabs) was inserted into the StuI site ofYPT6 created 22 bp behind the stop codon. To create pYX242-SEC35, the coding sequence of SEC35 gene with a newly created NcoI site at the 5′ end and an XhoI site at the 3′ end was amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA usingPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). This fragment was inserted into the NcoI-XhoI sites of pYX242 (R&D Systems). Plasmids pRS315-YPT6 and pRS325-SYS1 were constructed as described previously (7Tsukada M. Gallwitz D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2471-2481PubMed Google Scholar); pRS326-YPT1 was from R. Peng (this laboratory), and pWB-Acycα (P CYC1-SEC22-myc-α factor,CEN, URA3) was from H. D.

After mutation, anXbaI fragment of the mutated YPT6 gene with the adjacent URA3 gene as selection marker was integrated into the YPT6 locus of a haploid strain, and mutants were selected on SD-Ura plates. Chromosomal mutations were verified by sequencing the PCR products generated from genomic DNA of selectedypt6 mutants. Disruption of genes was performed by PCR-based replacement using the HIS3 gene amplified from plasmid pRS303 (22Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to replace the respective ORFs as described (23Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown at 25 °C to mid-log phase. Ten A 600 units of cells were collected before and after incubation at 37 or 39 °C for different times, resuspended in 150 μl of SDS sample buffer containing proteinase inhibitors, and lysed by vortexing for 10 min at 4 °C with glass beads. For PNGase F digestion, cells were collected, spheroplasted, and gently lysed in HEPES buffer. The lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C; the pellets were resolved in 0.5% SDS buffer containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and digestions were done according to the protocols advertised by the supplier (New England Biolabs). For immunoblotting, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with polyclonal antibodies against c-Myc epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CPY, ALP, or chitinase. Cell labeling and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (24Gaynor E.C. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were grown in synthetic minimal medium containing 2% glucose (SMM) (25Reid G.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 97: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) to mid-log phase and labeled with Tran35S-label (ICN) in either SD medium supplemented with the required amino acids or in SMM containing 1 m sorbitol and 1 mg/ml ovalbumin. Labeling in SMM was terminated by adding 10 mm NaN3/NaF and in SD medium by 2× spheroplast buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 m sorbitol, 20 mm NaN3/NaF, 20 mm dithiothreitol). Spheroplasts were made by adding 10 μg of zymolase 100-T (Seikagaku Kogyo) per 1A 600 unit of cells and incubating for 45 min at 30 °C. Secretion of proteins into the medium was assayed as described (26Peyroche A. Jackson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Invertase activity staining was carried out as described previously (27Benli M. Doring F. Robinson D.G. Yang X. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6460-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown at 25 °C to mid-log phase and then shifted to 37 °C for 1 h. 150 A 600 units of cells were collected. Lysates were prepared and subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation as described (28Schröder S. Schimmoller F. Singer-Kruger B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 895-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thirteen fractions were collected manually from the top of the gradient and mixed with one-fifth volume of 6× SDS sample buffer and incubated at 95 °C for 10 min prior to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were performed using specific antibodies against Kar2p, Emp47p, CPY, ALP, Anp1p, and the c-Myc epitope. Ypt6p is not required to sustain cell growth and multiplication. Therefore, previous studies (7Tsukada M. Gallwitz D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2471-2481PubMed Google Scholar, 8Tsukada M. Will E. Gallwitz D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11Li B. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16813-16819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Li B. Warner J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) on the functional role of Ypt6p were performed with ypt6 deletion or truncation mutants which are, however, sensitive to growth at elevated temperature. Since mutants lacking a given protein are sometimes able to adapt to such a situation by activating a by-path for example, we sought to investigate Ypt6p function in conditional mutants. By analogy with other heat-sensitive Ypt proteins, three single amino acid substitutions were introduced into the conserved (NKXD) sequence, known to be involved in nucleotide binding, and into the helical region following this sequence (Fig. 1 A). Each of the three mutant alleles, ypt6-1 (expressing Ypt6(K125N)p), ypt6-2 (expressing Ypt6(G139D)p), andypt6-3 (expressing Ypt6(A143D)p), conferred heat sensitivity to a varying extent on haploid cells grown in rich media (Fig. 1 B). ypt6-2 cells exhibited the most severe growth defect. Like ypt6Δ cells of the same genetic background, this mutant grew slowly at 35 °C and failed to proliferate at 37 °C. The ypt6-1 mutant grew well at 37 °C but extremely slowly at 39 °C, whereas growth ofypt6-3 cells slowed down at 37 °C and completely failed at 39 °C. Compared with wild type, all ypt6 mutants exhibited somewhat reduced growth at 14 °C. The growth defects of ypt6 mutants at high temperature were partially rescued by the addition of 1 m sorbitol, a phenotype described for mutants with a defective cell wall (29Cid V.J. Duran A. del Rey F. Snyder M.P. Nombela C. Sanchez M. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 345-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether ypt6 mutants are sensitive to SDS and calcofluor white (CFW), agents affecting cell wall integrity and being more toxic to mutants with a defective cell wall. Compared with the wild type strain, ypt6-2 and ypt6 null mutants were more sensitive to 0.005% SDS and 0.005% CFW (Fig. 1 C), indicating a cell wall defect in these mutants. We selected vacuolar carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and the secreted invertase as markers to test whether the intracellular vesicle transport was affected in the ypt6 mutants. These three proteins are N-linked glycoproteins that undergo core glycosylation in the ER and outer chain elongation in the Golgi before being transported to their final destination via different routes. CPY is transported via endosomes to the lumen of the vacuole, where it is processed to the mature form by proteolysis (30Stevens T. Esmon B. Schekman R. Cell. 1982; 30: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). ALP is transported directly to the membrane of the vacuole without passing through endosomes (31Piper R.C. Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and is also cleaved by proteolysis in the vacuole. Invertase is rapidly transported to the periplasmic space (32Esmon B. Novick P. Schekman R. Cell. 1981; 25: 451-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). By monitoring the molecular size and/or localization, it can be determined which step of transport is affected in the mutants. At steady state, accumulation of core-glycosylated CPY (p1-form) was detected inypt6-1, ypt6-2, and ypt6-3 when shifted to the nonpermissive temperature (37 or 39 °C) for 1 and 2 h (Fig. 2 A). Further kinetic analysis of CPY by pulse-chase experiments showed that at permissive temperature (25 or 30 °C), ypt6 mutants exhibited somewhat delayed maturation of the enzyme and a partial mis-sorting of the Golgi-glycosylated p2 form to the extracellular space. At nonpermissive temperature, ypt6 mutants exhibited significantly reduced CPY transport kinetics. However, defects in the Golgi-specific glycosylation were demonstrated by the presence of a smear between p2CPY and p1CPY (compare wild type and mutants in Fig. 2, Band C). This is best seen in the experiment shown in Fig. 2 C in which cells initially grown at 25 °C were taken up in SMM containing 1 m sorbitol for cell stabilization, preincubated at either 25 or 37 °C for 10 to 60 min, and then radioactively labeled for 10 min at the respective temperature. Although the extent of CPY labeling decreased with the length of time the cells were incubated in the hypertonic medium, mis-sorting of a significant fraction of the Golgi-glycosylated vacuolar enzyme was evident already 10 min after shift of ypt6-2 cells to the nonpermissive temperature, and the p2 form of CPY decreased in size at later time points. At 60 min of preincubation at 37 °C, p2-CPY of the ypt6-2 mutant cells, in contrast to wild type cells, was detectable only as a smear above the sharp band of the ER core-glycosylated enzyme, clearly demonstrating a severe glycosylation defect in the Golgi. The defects observed in ypt6-2 mutants were more severe than those in ypt6-1 and ypt6-3cells, consistent with the growth phenotype. As shown in Fig. 3 A, pro-ALP was also accumulated in ypt6 mutants at steady state upon shift to nonpermissive temperature. Further analysis by pulse-chase experiments indicated that at 25 °C, maturation of ALP was normal inypt6-2 mutant cells. However, at 37 °C, pro-ALP was accumulated and, in gels, migrated progressively slower at chase times from 0 to 30 min (Fig. 3 B), suggesting ongoing glycosylation in the Golgi.Figure 3ALP maturation in ypt6mutants. A, Western blot analysis of ALP with total cellular protein. The same extracts used in the experiment of Fig. 2 A were analyzed with anti-ALP antibody. B, pulse-chase analysis with WT (MSUC-3D) and ypt6-2 (ZLY2) mutants. Cells were grown and subjected to pulse-chase analysis as described in the legend to Fig. 2 B. ALP was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. * denotes an unrelated protein band that does not change electrophoretic behavior after PNGase F treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Invertase was analyzed both in the intracellular and extracellular fraction by activity staining in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. At permissive temperature, the secretion of highly glycosylated invertase was normal in ypt6 mutants as compared with wild type cells. At nonpermissive temperature, ypt6-1 and ypt6-3mutants showed slight defects in the secretion and glycosylation of the enzyme. Importantly, at 37 °C invertase in ypt6-2 mutant cells was clearly underglycosylated, and somewhat less than half of the enzyme was accumulated inside the cell. As controls for ER-to-Golgi transport mutants, processing and secretion of invertase was investigated in sec18-1 and ypt1 A136D strains at nonpermissive conditions. In these mutants, the enzyme was nearly completely trapped inside the cells in ER-glycosylated forms (Fig. 4 A). To analyze further whether Ypt6p is involved in secretion, we assayed for the export of proteins into the growth medium (24Gaynor E.C. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 26Peyroche A. Jackson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then subjected to pulse-chase at 37 °C. Cells were removed by centrifugation, and the proteins in the medium were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and identified by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 4 B, no protein band was detected in the medium ofsec18-1 cells, and only very faint bands were seen in the medium of ypt1 A136D cells, indicating the known secretion block in these two mutants. However, the same set of secreted proteins, including the most prominent band at 130–150 kDa that represents HSP150 (24Gaynor E.C. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 26Peyroche A. Jackson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), was visible in the medium of wild type,ypt6-2, and ret2-1 cells, the latter being defective in retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER (33Cosson P. Demolliere C. Hennecke S. Duden R. Letourneur F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Comparing the band intensities, it appears that secretion inypt6-2 mutants was somewhat reduced. We next examined the recycling of the v-SNARE Sec22p inypt6-2 mutant cells. Sec22p is known to cycle between the Golgi and the ER as well as between Golgi compartments. In wild type cells, only a small fraction of the v-SNARE reaches the late Golgi, but in mutants defective in retrograde transport of ER resident proteins, Sec22p is easily mis-sorted to this compartment (34Ballensiefen W. Ossipov D. Schmitt H.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1507-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Andag U. Neumann T. Schmitt H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39150-39160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in which the Kex2 protease resides. For this study, we took advantage of an Sec22-α factor fusion protein with a Kex2p cleavage site in its linker region and a c-Myc epitope tag adjacent to Sec22p. Cleavage of the fusion protein signals arrival in the late Golgi (34Ballensiefen W. Ossipov D. Schmitt H.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1507-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 C, the fraction of the fusion protein cleaved was significantly higher in ypt6-2 mutant cells compared with wild type cells independent of the temperature at which the experiment was conducted. This clearly indicates a recycling defect in Ypt6p-defective cells that could involve retrograde Golgi and/or Golgi-to-ER trafficking. The glycosylation defects of CPY and invertase inypt6 mutants prompted us to examine whether the defects resulted from instability of glycosyltransferases. In yeast cells, outer chain elongation of glycoproteins is catalyzed by glycosyltransferases in the Golgi. Among them, Anp1p, Mnn9p, and Van1p have been reported to recycle between the ER and the Golgi and are subject to mislocalization and to degradation in the vacuole when retrograde transport to the ER is blocked (36Todorow Z. Spang A. Carmack E. Yates J. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13643-13648Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We integrated c-Myc epitope-tagged versions of ANP1, MNN9, and VAN1into the genome of wild type and ypt6-2 strains and followed the fate of the tagged proteins by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5 A, a shift of cells to 37 °C for 2 h did not result in a significant reduction of Anp1p-myc, Mnn9p-myc, and Van1p-myc in ypt6-2 compared with wild type cells. Also no redistribution of Mnn9p-myc and Anp1p was detected in ypt6-2 mutant cells in sucrose gradient analysis (Fig. 6 D), suggesting other reason(s) for the glycosylation defects observed. Likewise, there was no decrease of the Golgi protein Emp47p following shift ofypt6-2 cells to nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 5 A).Figure 6Distribution of proteins in sucrose gradients of ypt6-2 lysates. WT (A),ypt6-2 (B), and sec23-1 (C) strains expressing Myc-tagged Och1p (ZLY351, ZLY356, and ZLY184) were grown at 25 °C to mid-log phase and shifted to 37 °C for 1 h. Spheroplasts were generated and lysed gently. Lysates were fractionated by sucrose gradient (18–60%) centrifugation and assayed for the distribution of Och1p-myc, Emp47p, Kar2p, CPY, and ALP by immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies. Relative levels of proteins on immunoblots were quantified using a Lumi-Imager.D, WT and ypt6-2 strains expressing Mnn9p-myc (ZLY353 and ZLY358) were used to make lysates and subjected to fractionation and immunoblot analysis as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Two o"
https://openalex.org/W2164273115,"Creatine kinase isoenzymes are very susceptible to free radical damage and are inactivated by superoxide radicals and peroxynitrite. In this study, we have analyzed the effects of peroxynitrite on enzymatic activity and octamer stability of the two human mitochondrial isoenzymes (ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase (uMtCK) and sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase (sMtCK)), as well as of chicken sMtCK, and identified the involved residues. Inactivation by peroxynitrite was concentration-dependent and similar for both types of MtCK isoenzymes. Because peroxynitrite did not lower the residual activity of a sMtCK mutant missing the active site cysteine (C278G), oxidation of this residue is sufficient to explain MtCK inactivation. Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed oxidation of Cys-278 and further revealed oxidation of the C-terminal Cys-358, possibly involved in MtCK/membrane interaction. Peroxynitrite also led to concentration-dependent dissociation of MtCK octamers into dimers. In this study, ubiquitous uMtCK was much more stable than sarcomeric sMtCK. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed chemical modifications in peptide Gly-263–Arg-271 located at the dimer/dimer interface, including oxidation of Met-267 and nitration of Trp-268 and/or Trp-264, the latter being a very critical residue for octamer stability. These data demonstrate that peroxynitrite affects the octameric state of MtCK and confirms human sMtCK as the generally more susceptible isoenzyme. The results provide a molecular explanation of how oxidative damage can lead to inactivation and decreased octamer/dimer ratio of MtCK, as seen in neurodegenerative diseases and heart pathology, respectively.

The CK system is present in cells with high and fluctuating energy demands, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, brain, and other neuronal tissues, where a mitochondrial and a cytosolic isoform are coexpressed (for reviews, see Refs. 1Wyss M.

Biochem. 1998; 184: 125-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In striated muscle, cytosolic muscle-type CK is expressed together with sarcomeric mitochondrial CK (sMtCK), whereas in brain and many other tissues, the cytosolic brain-type CK is found together with ubiquitous mitochondrial CK (uMtCK). In contrast to the exclusively dimeric cytosolic CK, the mitochondrial isoenzymes (MtCK) can form cube-like octameric molecules (5Schnyder T. Gross H. Winkler H. Eppenberger H.M. Wallimann T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Fritz-Wolf K. Schnyder T. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Nature. 1996; 381: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). MtCK is bound to the outer leaflet of the inner mitochondrial membrane and located in the intermembrane space, where it cross-links both mitochondrial membranes, forming contact sites (7Brdiczka D. Bucheler K. Kottke M. Adams V. Nalam V.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Adams V. Bosch W. Schlegel J. Wallimann T. Brdiczka D. Biochim.

Differentiation. 1991; 46: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contact sites, MtCK forms functional complexes with the adenylate translocator of the inner and porin of the outer mitochondrial membrane, as evidenced, for example, by creatine stimulation of mitochondrial respiration (10Kay L. Nicolay K. Wieringa B. Saks V. Wallimann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6937-6944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) or plasmon resonance spectroscopy (11Schlattner U.

In mainly oxidative tissue, this microcompartment facilitates the vectorial transport of high-energy phosphate from the sites of energy production in the mitochondrial matrix to cytosolic sites of energy consumption. PCr is generated by MtCK using mitochondrial ATP (for review see Ref.12Brdiczka D. Kaldis P. Wallimann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27640-27644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and transported into the cytosol, where ATP pools are replenished by the reverse reaction of cytosolic CK, which is partially located in the vicinity of cellular ATPases. The octameric structure of MtCK was shown to be crucial for this transport function of the “PCr-shuttle,” because reduced octamer stability of N-terminally mutated MtCK (13Kaldis P. Furter R. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 952-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) transfected into rat neonatal cardiomyocytes resulted in decreased creatine-stimulated mitochondrial respiration (14Khuchua Z.A.

Mitochondrial sMtCK and uMtCK isoenzymes are highly homologous, sharing about 85% of identical amino acids, a further 5% of conservative replacements (15Mühlebach S.M. Gross M. Wirz T. Wallimann T. Perriard J.C. Wyss M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 133–134: 245-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and the same overall fold in their molecular structure (6Fritz-Wolf K. Schnyder T. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Nature. 1996; 381: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 16Eder M. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Proteins. 2000; 39: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The active site in particular is highly similar in all CKs and even in the other related guanidino kinases (17Eder M. Schlattner U. Becker A. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Fritz-Wolf K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2258-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Zhou G. Somasundaram T. Blanc E. Parthasarathy G. Ellington W.R. Chapman M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8449-8454Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Despite this homology, human MtCK isoenzymes differ in many properties, including substrate affinity, substrate binding synergism, membrane interaction, and octamer stability (19Schlattner U. Eder M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17314-17320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). MtCK is known to be very susceptible to oxygen radical damage (21Koufen P. Ruck A. Brdiczka D. Wendt S. Wallimann T. Stark G. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide inhibits creatine kinase activity in solution as well as in adult rat ventricular myocytes. This inhibition can be reversed by the addition of dithiothreitol (22Arstall M.A. Bailey C. Gross W.L. Bak M. Balligand J.L. Kelly R.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 979-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, the inhibition of CK by superoxide anions (O2−) (23Yuan G. Kaneko M. Masuda H. Hon R.B. Kobayashi A. Yamazaki N. Biochim. Biophys.

Inactivation of cytosolic and mitochondrial CK would interrupt the “PCr-shuttle” and would have severe effects on the energetics of work performance and Ca2+ homeostasis in muscle similar to those seen in double-knockout mice lacking both the cytosolic and mitochondrial CK (27Steeghs K. Oerlemans F. de Haan A. Heerschap A. Verdoodt L. de Bie M. Ruitenbeek W. Benders A. Jost C. van Deursen J. Tullson P. Terjung R. Jap P. Jacob W. Pette D. Wieringa B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 183-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ONOO− is the product of the nearly diffusion-controlled reaction between NO and O2−, both of these compounds being produced by mitochondria (28Ghafourifar P. Richter C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 29Richter C. Ghafourifar P. Schweizer M. Laffranchi R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 914-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because MtCK is located near the production site of ONOO−, a powerful oxidant, MtCK represents a prime target for ONOO−-induced damage (30Stachowiak O. Dolder M. Wallimann T. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16694-16699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). ONOO−is known to play a role in cells under conditions of oxidative stress, as is the case in heart disease and after ischemia/reperfusion (31Liu P. Hock C.E. Nagele R. Wong P.Y. Am. J.

Kotecha S. Shuker D.E. Nitric Oxide. 1998; 2: 324-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In the present study, we addressed the question of whether ONOO− administered in vitro has differential effects on enzymatic activity and octamer stability of the two human MtCK isoenzymes. Divergent properties of human sMtCK and uMtCK have already been reported (19Schlattner U. Eder M. Dolder M. Khuchua Z.A. Strauss A.W. Wallimann T. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Schlattner U. Wallimann T. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and may be relevant to the different pathologies in heart and neuronal tissue, where an impaired CK system is involved. For a molecular description of ONOO−-induced MtCK damage, mass spectrometry was applied to identify those amino acid residues that are modified by ONOO−. All enzymes and coenzymes were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Rotkreuz, Switzerland), α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was from Aldrich (Buchs, Switzerland), and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Further chemicals were purchased from standard suppliers and were of the highest purity commercially available. Human MtCK isoforms (19Schlattner U. Eder M. Dolder M. Khuchua Z.A. Strauss A.W. Wallimann T. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and chicken sMtCK were heterologously expressed according to a protocol described previously (48Furter R. Kaldis P. Furter-Graves E.M. Schnyder T. Eppenberger H.M. Wallimann T. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ONOO− was a generous gift from Prof. W. Koppenol (Laboratorium für Anorganische Chemie, ETH Zürich, Switzerland). The concentration of ONOO− stock solution, synthesized from the reaction of gaseous NO with solid potassium superoxide (49Koppenol W.H. Kissner R. Beckman J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 296-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was determined photometrically at 302 nm in 10 mm NaOH (εmm = 1.67) before use. ONOO−, in a volume of 20 ml of 10 mm NaOH, was added to 200 μl of protein solution containing 0.5 mg/ml MtCK in 100 mmNa3PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, to reach final ONOO− concentrations between 1 and 1000 μm. To the control, 20 μl of NaOH but no ONOO− was added, which led to a pH-shift in the protein solution by <0.05 pH-units. The oligomeric state of MtCK was determined by gel permeation chromatography on a Superose 12 column (Pharmacia) at room temperature in running buffer (50 mm Na3PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Peak areas in the elution profile were quantified by graphical integration using Biocad Sprint HPLC software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The specific CK activities were assayed photometrically in the reverse reaction, using the glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase/hexokinase-coupled enzyme assay as described previously (19Schlattner U. Eder M. Dolder M. Khuchua Z.A. Strauss A.W. Wallimann T. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) at room temperature (22 °C). ONOO−-treated MtCK, as well as native MtCK, were dialyzed against 50 mmNH4HCO3 and 20 mm methylamine, pH 8.0, before adding urea to a final concentration of 1 m. The proteins were digested for 16 h at 37 °C by adding trypsin in an enzyme-to-protein ratio of 1:100. The reaction was stopped by freezing the samples. Mass spectra were performed on a Voyager-DE Elite MALDI-TOF (Applied Biosystems) in positive ion reflector mode, using either α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in a 2:1 mixture of acetonitril, 0.1% trifluoroacetetic acid in H2O. For sample preparation, 0.5 μl of the digested protein solution was mixed without further preparation with 0.5 μl of the matrix solution directly on target and the solution was air-dried. Postsource decay spectra were recorded on an Axima-CFR MALDI-TOF (Kratos/Shimadzu, Manchester, UK) with a curved field reflection. The sensitivity of human sMtCK and uMtCK toward ONOO− was first compared with respect to enzymatic activity. Activity of both human MtCK isoenzymes, as determined immediately after ONOO− administration, decreased in a dose-dependent fashion at already very low ONOO− concentrations (Fig. 1). The IC50 was determined by graphical estimation to be about 8 μm. This inactivation was not reversed by subsequent addition of 20 mm dithiothreitol, which reduces disulfides and reversesS-nitrosylation (22Arstall M.A. Bailey C. Gross W.L. Bak M. Balligand J.L. Kelly R.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 979-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cysteine 278 is a highly conserved residue in the active site of CK, which is known to be very reactive and essential for substrate binding and synergism in all guanidino kinases (18Zhou G. Somasundaram T. Blanc E. Parthasarathy G. Ellington W.R. Chapman M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8449-8454Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 50Furter R. Furter-Graves E.M. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7022-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To test whether MtCK inactivation was caused by oxidation of this residue, a glycine replacement mutant (C278G) of chicken sMtCK (50Furter R. Furter-Graves E.M. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7022-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) was treated with ONOO− in the same manner. Chicken sMtCK is almost identical to human sMtCK (97% sequence identity) and shows exactly the same dose-response curve for ONOO−-inactivation. The residual enzymatic activity of the C278G mutant, which is about 3–5% compared with wild type depending on the assay conditions, was completely unaffected by ONOO− (Fig. 1). In parallel experiments, sMtCK and uMtCK solutions with an initial octamer content of more than 80% were treated with increasing concentrations of ONOO− and kept overnight at room temperature to reach a stable octamer-dimer equilibrium. Subsequent gel permeation chromatography was performed to determine the oligomeric state of the isoenzymes as a function of peroxynitrite concentration (Fig. 2). Although ONOO−administration destabilized both MtCK isoenzymes and favored their dissociation into dimers, uMtCK was significantly more stable than sMtCK. Whereas for the latter, a concentration of only about 240 μm ONOO− was sufficient to dissociate 50% of the initial octamer concentration into dimers (C50value), this concentration was about 790 μm for the brain-type uMtCK (Fig. 2). To further identify the MtCK residues modified by ONOO−, human uMtCK, human sMtCK, and chicken sMtCK were treated with increasing concentrations of ONOO− as before and, after exhaustive digestion by trypsin, subjected to mass spectrometric analysis by MALDI-TOF. Chemically modified peptides of ONOO−-treated MtCK were identified by their higher molecular mass compared with peptides derived from untreated control protein. Fig. 3 summarizes all peptides that could be unambiguously identified by mass spectrometry in the native, as well as the ONOO−-treated human isoenzymes (highlighted in gray in Fig. 3 A), aligned with the amino acid sequences. Some theoretically predicted fragments that could harbor putative ONOO−-sensitive residues (Fig. 3 A, bold capital letters in whiteareas) were not covered by the mass spectrometric analysis. However, we did not pursue their identification, because they are neither located in the active site or at the dimer/dimer interface nor have any other known functions for the enzyme been attributed to them. From the MtCK peptides recovered by MALDI-TOF, only three were modified by ONOO− treatment (Fig. 3 A, highlighted inblack with residues marked by arrowheads): (i) peptide Gly-263–Arg-271 containing two tryptophans, Trp-264 and Trp-268, (ii) peptide Leu-272–Arg-287 containing the active site Cys-278, and (iii) peptide Ser-340–Arg-360, including the C-terminal Cys-358. The cysteine residues in the latter two fragments were modified by single and double oxidation. Thus, combined with results described above for the C278G mutant, modification of Cys-278 is sufficient to explain the loss of enzymatic MtCK activity upon peroxynitrite treatment. The modified peptide Gly-263–Arg-271 is located at the dimer/dimer interfaces of the octameric MtCK isoenzymes, as revealed by the x-ray structures of sMtCK (6Fritz-Wolf K. Schnyder T. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Nature. 1996; 381: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and uMtCK (16Eder M. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Proteins. 2000; 39: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All mass shifts occurring with this peptide (Fig. 4) can be explained by reactions of ONOO− with methionine and tryptophan. The difference of 16 Da would point to oxidation of methionine Met-267, whereas further mass shifts are caused by nitration of Trp-264 and/or Trp-268. The mass shift of 45 Da corresponds to nitration of a tryptophan residue, whereas the mass shift of 29 Da can be explained by the loss of one oxygen from the nitro group. This loss of oxygen can occur as a laser-induced photochemical decomposition, as has been shown for the similar aromatic side chain nitro-tyrosine (51Sarver A. Scheffler N.K. Shetlar M.D. Gibson B.W. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 12: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Finally, the mass shift of 61 Da can be explained by the nitration of one tryptophan plus the additional oxidation of methionine (Fig. 4). Because peptide Gly-263–Arg-271 contains only Trp-264 and Trp-268, but no tyrosine, this modification-pattern unambiguously identifies tryptophan nitration. All these latter modifications are at or near the dimer/dimer interface and show the same concentration dependence as octamer dissociation (compare Figs. 2 and 4). This strongly indicated that these modifications are involved in octamer dissociation. In fact, Trp-264 in particular has been identified by site-directed mutagenesis to be crucial for octamer stability (52Gross M. Furter-Graves E.M. Wallimann T. Eppenberger H.M. Furter R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1058-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To identify which of the two tryptophans in the peptide Gly-263–Arg-271 was modified, we applied postsource decay MALDI-TOF with human sMtCK. When mass selection was set to pass the unmodified parent ion at a measuredm/z of 1255 (calculated 1254.4), all b- and y-fragments could be detected, leaving no doubt about the identity of this peptide. However, postsource decay analysis of the nitration-modified parent ion did not reveal a single modified tryptophan. By contrast, we detected a b-ion (b4) that is a unique fragment to the peptide modified at Trp-264 but also a y-ion (y6) that is unique to the peptide modified at Trp-268, suggesting that both Trp-264 and Trp-268 are partially modified. In this study, we show that both human mitochondrial CK isoenzymes are very sensitive to ONOO−-induced damage but differ in part in the dose-dependence of the deleterious modifications. The concentration for half-maximal inactivation was 8 μmONOO− for both sMtCK and uMtCK, whereas concentration for half-maximal octamer dissociation was only 240 μmONOO− for sMtCK but was 790 μm for uMtCK. We could also identify the MtCK residues involved in ONOO−damage, namely active site Cys-278, as well as Met-267, Trp-264, and/or Trp-268 at the dimer/dimer interface. Half maximal inactivation of human MtCK isoenzymes occurred at very low ONOO− concentrations (i.e. 8 μm), which corresponds to a ONOO−:MtCK monomer-ratio of 0.7:1. This is in line with earlier results on chicken sMtCK, showing inactivation with an IC50 of 35 μm (30Stachowiak O. Dolder M. Wallimann T. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16694-16699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar); the slightly decreased IC50 value in our study could be attributable to species-specific differences or to the stronger buffering capacity used. Cytosolic muscle CK was reported to be inactivated with an IC50 of 2.5 μmONOO− (26Konorev E.A. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, their protein concentrations were much lower (0.4 μg/ml, compared with the 0.5 mg/ml used here), resulting in a significantly higher ONOO−:protein ratio of about 50:1 at the IC50 value. It is well known that ONOO− added in a single bolus can decompose very quickly in water without reacting with the highly diluted protein. Our work has taken into account the high MtCK concentration in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and the limited stability of MtCK octamers below a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml (20Schlattner U. Wallimann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17314-17320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In earlier studies, it was speculated that modifications of the highly reactive active site cysteine (Cys-278 in MtCK, Cys-283 in cytosolic CK) cause enzymatic inactivation (26Konorev E.A. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 30Stachowiak O. Dolder M. Wallimann T. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16694-16699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Here, we show unambiguously the modification of this residue and its role in inactivation, using MALDI-MS analysis of ONOO−-modified wild-type enzyme and activity measurements of a C278G replacement mutant. As shown previously, site-directed mutagenesis of Cys-278 leads to significant but not complete inactivation of the enzyme and, most importantly, to a complete loss of substrate synergism (50Furter R. Furter-Graves E.M. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7022-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This residue is located in the active site of MtCK (6Fritz-Wolf K. Schnyder T. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Nature. 1996; 381: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and its homologue in the transition state structure of the closely related arginine kinase is in direct contact with the reactive guanidino group of the arginine substrate (18Zhou G. Somasundaram T. Blanc E. Parthasarathy G. Ellington W.R. Chapman M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8449-8454Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies and the CK x-ray structures identified another catalytically important residue in the active site of MtCK that can potentially be modified by peroxynitrite, the active site Trp-223 (6Fritz-Wolf K. Schnyder T. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Nature. 1996; 381: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar,52Gross M. Furter-Graves E.M. Wallimann T. Eppenberger H.M. Furter R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1058-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, peptide Gly-211–Arg-231 containing this tryptophan showed no mass shift after ONOO− exposure, demonstrating that Trp-223 is not modified by ONOO−, similar to inactivation by radiation (21Koufen P. Ruck A. Brdiczka D. Wendt S. Wallimann T. Stark G. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because the active site is highly conserved throughout all CK isoenzymes and even the whole group of guanidino kinases (17Eder M. Schlattner U. Becker A. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Fritz-Wolf K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2258-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Zhou G. Somasundaram T. Blanc E. Parthasarathy G. Ellington W.R. Chapman M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8449-8454Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), it can be tacitly assumed that the active site cysteine is involved as the prime target of ONOO− in all these kinases. In addition, this homology also explains why there is no difference between the two human MtCK isoenzymes with regard to inactivation. Oxidation at the C-terminal cysteine Cys-358 may lead to reduced membrane binding of MtCK, as we have observed after anthracycline-induced oxidation of human MtCK in vitro (47Tokarska-Schlattner M. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Anthracyclines are efficient cancer chemotherapeutics, but they also induce oxidative damage of proteins such as MtCK that may cause their well known cardiotoxic side-effects. The octamer can be considered the physiological form of MtCK. Impaired octamer stability leads to reduced creatine stimulated mitochondrial respiration (14Khuchua Z.A. Qin W. Boero J. Cheng J. Payne R.M. Saks V.A. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22990-22996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We show here that ONOO− also destabilizes the octameric structure of MtCK, albeit at higher concentrations than necessary for inactivation and by affecting human sMtCK much more than human uMtCK. The higher octamer stability of uMtCK could be caused by reduced reactivity toward ONOO− or an intrinsically higher octamer stability compared with sMtCK. However, the latter mechanism is strongly supported by different observations. A very similar difference in octamer stability between human uMtCK and sMtCK was observed in vitro after incubation with transition state analogue complex (20Schlattner U. Wallimann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17314-17320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), as well as after treatment with anthracyclines (47Tokarska-Schlattner M. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Finally, an exact comparison of the x-ray structures (6Fritz-Wolf K. Schnyder T. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Nature. 1996; 381: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 16Eder M. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Proteins. 2000; 39: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and a direct biophysical approach (20Schlattner U. Wallimann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17314-17320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) revealed that the mainly hydrophobic dimer/dimer interfaces of uMtCK are larger than those of sMtCK and contain additional polar interactions that preserve the octameric state of uMtCK. Peroxynitrite not only destabilizes the octameric structure, at much lower concentrations it already prevents formation of octamers from dimers as shown in vitro with chicken sMtCK (53Soboll S. Brdiczka D. Jahnke D. Schmidt A. Schlattner U. Wendt S. Wyss M. Wallimann T. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 857-866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, inactivation and dimerization of MtCKin vivo eventually occur simultaneously. According to our mass spectrometric results, destabilization of octameric MtCK by ONOO− is caused by the chemical modification of peptide Gly-263–Arg-271, which is part of the dimer/dimer interface and responsible for hydrophobic stabilization of the MtCK octamer (6Fritz-Wolf K. Schnyder T. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Nature. 1996; 381: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 16Eder M. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Proteins. 2000; 39: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The modifications are clustered and involve oxidation of Met-267 and nitration of Trp-268 and/or Trp-264. Trp-264 is a key residue in the hydrophobic dimer/dimer interaction patch, as revealed by x-ray crystallography (6Fritz-Wolf K. Schnyder T. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Nature. 1996; 381: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and replacement mutants leading to octamer destabilization (52Gross M. Furter-Graves E.M. Wallimann T. Eppenberger H.M. Furter R. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1058-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but modifications rendering the nearby residues such as Trp-268 more polar may also contribute to destabilization. Both tyrosine residues present in the dimer/dimer interface, Tyr-15 and Tyr-34 (6Fritz-Wolf K. Schnyder T. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Nature. 1996; 381: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), were not modified by ONOO− at least in sMtCK, because the peptides containing these residues (Leu-8–Arg-19 and Lys-20–Lys-36, respectively) did not show any mass shift upon ONOO− treatment. The CK system plays an important physiological role for cellular energetics in health and disease (for review, see Ref. 54Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Guerrero L. Dolder M. Mori A. Ishida M. Clark J.F. Guanidino Compounds. Blackwell Science, Oxford, England1999: 117-129Google Scholar). A compromised CK system, caused, among others, by oxygen radical damage to the enzyme, has been implicated in heart disease (34Nascimben L. Ingwall J.S. Pauletto P. Friedrich J. Gwathmey J.K. Saks V. Pessina A.C. Allen P.D. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1894-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), as well as in many neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease (35Ferrante R.J.

Sci. 2000; 924: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In brains of persons with Alzheimer's disease, CK activity decreased, whereas mRNA levels did not change significantly (55Aksenov M.Y. Aksenova M.V. Payne R.M. Smith C.D. Markesbery W.R. Carney J.M. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 56Aksenova M.V. Aksenov M.Y. Markesbery W.R. Butterfield D.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and cytosolic brain-type CK was oxidatively modified (39Castegna A. Aksenov M. Aksenova M. Thongboonkerd V. Klein J. Pierce W.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2520-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Besides the integrity of the active site, the octameric state of MtCK seems also to be crucial for efficient vectorial channeling of high-energy phosphates from mitochondria to the cytosol (4Schlattner U. Forstner M. Eder M. Stachowiak O. Fritz-Wolf K. Wallimann T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 125-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Khuchua Z.A. Qin W. Boero J. Cheng J. Payne R.M. Saks V.A. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22990-22996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, octameric MtCK has been shown to stabilize mitochondria from going into permeability transition (58O'Gorman E. Beutner G. Dolder M. Koretsky A.P. Brdiczka D. Wallimann T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, a decrease in MtCK octamer content caused by ONOO−could interrupt the creatine/PCr-shuttle and also lead to early events of apoptosis (59Beutner G. Ruck A. Riede B. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In animal models of short- and long-term ischemia-reperfusion damage, as well as diseased human heart, a significant decrease of the octamer/dimer ratio was observed (53Soboll S. Brdiczka D. Jahnke D. Schmidt A. Schlattner U. Wendt S. Wyss M. Wallimann T. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 857-866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Some of the main pathological symptoms of these cardiomyopathies, but also of many neurodegenerative diseases, are caused by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and involve mitochondria (33Beal M.F. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 298-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 60Schulz R. Dodge K.L. Lopaschuk G.D. Clanachan A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1212-H1219PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is highly probable that ONOO−-induced modifications at the dimer/dimer interfaces of MtCK octamers, which we have observedin vitro, also occur in vivo. The fact that uMtCK is significantly more stable than sMtCK could explain why a decreased octamer/dimer ratio seems to be an early event in heart disease, whereas it may occur in brain and neuronal tissue only at a more advanced stage of neurodegeneration. In summary, this study shows that ONOO− has severe effects on enzyme activity, as well as on the stability of human MtCK octamers, with sMtCK being more susceptible than uMtCK in the latter case. Among the modified amino acid side chains, we could identify some key residues, such as active site Cys-278 and dimer/dimer interface Trp-264. In vivo, molecular damage of MtCK would lead to an interruption of the creatine/PCr-shuttle and therefore to a lower cellular energy state, with all its far-reaching consequences. We thank Drs. R. Kissner and W. Koppenol for providing ONOO−, Dr. S. Friess for recording the postsource decay spectra, and Dr. M. Mehl for carefully reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2329147600,"Gene amplification is frequently associated with tumor progression, hence, understanding the underlying mechanisms is important. The study of in vitro model systems indicated that different initial mechanisms accumulate amplified copies within the chromosomes (hsr) or on extra-chromosomal elements (dmin). It has long been suggested that formation of dmin could also occur following hsr breakdown. In order to check this hypothesis, we developed an approach based on the properties of the I-SceI meganuclease, which induces targeted DNA double-strand breaks. A clone containing an I-SceI site, integrated by chance close to an endogenous dhfr gene locus, was used to select for methotrexate resistant mutants. We recovered clones in which the I-SceI site was passively co-amplified with the dhfr gene within the same hsr. We show that I-SceI-induced hsr breakdown leads to the formation of dmin and creates different types of chromosomal rearrangements, including inversions. This demonstrates, for the first time, a direct relationship between double-strand breaks and inversions. Finally, we show that activation of fragile sites by aphidicolin or hypoxia in hsr-containing cells also generates dmin and a variety of chromosomal rearrangements. This may constitute a valuable model to study the consequences of breaks induced in hsr of cancer cells in vivo."

Falk H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In barley, two POR proteins have been identified, termed PORA and PORB (4Holtorf H. Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Bereza B. Apel K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3254-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Both are light- and NADPH-dependent enzymes, which differ remarkably in their expression patterns during plant development. PORA appears only transiently in dark-grown seedlings, whereas PORB is expressed in etiolated, illuminated, and light-adapted plants (4Holtorf H. Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Bereza B. Apel K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3254-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The partial overlap in expression suggests that both PORA and PORB may be needed for efficient seedling de-etiolation. We proposed that in the prolamellar body of etioplasts, the PORA and PORB may cooperate in terms of a novel “light-harvesting POR-Pchlidea/b” complex termed LHPP (5Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar).In vitro reconstitution experiments with synthetic zinc analogs of Pchlide a and Pchlideb, termed zinc protopheophorbides (ZnPP) a andb, respectively, indeed supported such a model. PORA-ZnPPb-NADPH and PORB-ZnPPa-NADPH ternary complexes were found to form oligomers (5Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We observed that light, which was absorbed by ZnPPb, was transferred onto ZnPPa (5Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This, by virtue of PORB, was reduced to zinc pheophorbide a (5Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the zinc analog of Chlide a(6Schoch S. Helfrich M. Wiktorsson B. Sundqvist C. Rüdiger W. Ryberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The existence of analogous higher molecular weight light harvesting structures in vivo was inferred from previously reported energy transfer reactions, taking place from so-called photoinactive Pchlide to photoactive Pchlide and from photoinactive Pchlide to Chlide, in prolamellar bodies before and after flash light illumination (7Smith J.H.C. Benitez A. Plant Physiol. 1954; 29: 135-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kahn A. Boardman N.K. Thorne S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Mathis P.

Domanskii V.P. Kolyago V.M. Photosynthetica. 1993; 29: 227-234Google Scholar).Previous critiques questioned the existence of a Pchlidea/b-containing light-harvesting complex in vivo, based on the following main arguments (13Armstrong G.A. Apel K. Rüdiger W. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 40-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). First, previous work seemed to indicate a lack of Pchlide b in etiolated plants (14Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Second, respective in vitro reconstitution experiments had thus far not been presented for Pchlide aand Pchlide b, which, according to the LHPP model (5Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar), should be cognate substrates of the PORB and PORA, respectively. Third, neither the reconstituted nor the presumed authentic complex had been resolved under native conditions as higher molecular weight, lipid-containing structures.In the present study, we addressed these important questions and performed in vitro reconstitution experiments. We demonstrate that the PORA and PORB display the same stringent substrate specificities for Pchlide a and Pchlide b as those reported previously for ZnPPa and ZnPPb(5Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We further show that reconstituted PORA-Pchlide b-NADPH and PORB-Pchlide a-NADPH ternary complexes establish higher molecular mass structures, the spectroscopic and physicochemical properties of which are very close, in most aspects even indistinguishable, from those of the presumed native complex.RESULTSOur previous reconstitution experiments had shown that the PORA and PORB proteins of barley are able to form higher molecular weight light-harvesting complexes if complexed with ZnPPb and ZnPPa, respectively, plus NADPH (5Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As a first step to establish such complexes also with their presumed natural substrates, we synthesized Pchlides a and b chemically (6Schoch S. Helfrich M. Wiktorsson B. Sundqvist C. Rüdiger W. Ryberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,14Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The isolated and purified pigments are characterized in an accompanying paper (32Reinbothe, S., Pollmann, S. & Reinbothe, C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 800–806Google Scholar). They were added to PORA and PORB polypeptides, which had been synthesized from corresponding cDNA clones by coupled in vitro transcription/translation (20Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Pigment binding was tested in the following manner. Different amounts of the PORA and PORB were added to an excess of NADPH and isolated pigment, incubated for 15 min in darkness, and subsequently separated from the excess of nonbound pigments by gel filtration on Sephadex G15 (22Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Runge S. Apel K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). POR-pigment complexes running in the flow-through were then extracted with 100% acetone containing 0.1% (v/v) diethyl pyrocarbonate, and pigments were identified and quantified by HPLC and room temperature absorbance and fluorescence measurements.Fig. 1 shows a plot of the amount of Pchlide a and Pchlide b bound to the PORA or PORBversus the enzyme concentrations. From the linear relationships, it turned out that 1 μg of the PORA bound ∼34.11 ng of Pchlide b and 31.95 ng of ZnPPb but only 3.5 ng of Pchlide a and 3.28 ng of ZnPPa, respectively. This corresponded to 27.72 pmol of PORA, 54.3 pmol of Pchlide b (ZnPPb), and 5.7 pmol of Pchlidea (ZnPPa), respectively, and suggested that there were 1:2 versus 1:0.2 stoichiometries of PORA to pigment in the recovered PORA-Pchlide (ZnPP) complexes. For the PORB, just the opposite binding preferences were seen: 1 μg (26.26 pmol) of the PORB bound ∼33.2 ng of Pchlide a (31.1 ng of ZnPPa)(each corresponding to ∼54.2 pmol of the pigment) and only 3.2 ng of Pchlide b (3.02 ng of ZnPPb) (each corresponding to ∼5.1 pmol of the pigment).Given that the PORA and PORB displayed the same stringent substrate specificities for Pchlides a and b as those reported previously for ZnPPa and ZnPPb (5Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we next established reaction conditions that would allow the generation of higher molecular weight Pchlide a/b-POR light-harvesting complexes. Equimolar amounts of reconstituted PORA-Pchlide b-NADPH and PORB-Pchlide a-NADPH ternary complexes were mixed and, after a 15-min incubation in darkness, subjected to a further step of gel filtration on Sephadex G100 (5Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or size-fractionated on a Superose 6 column (see “Materials and Methods”).Fig. 2 A shows a size fractionation on Superose 6. It revealed that the pigment-complexed PORA and PORB indeed gave rise to a higher molecular weight complex. Its size of ∼480 kDa was similar to that of the so-called Pchlide holochrome of bean (33Boardman N.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 62: 63-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Free, nonassembled PORA- and PORB-pigment ternary complexes were eluted at much later time points (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Reconstitution of a photoactive LHPP in vitro. PORA-Pchlide b-NADPH and PORB-Pchlidea-NADPH ternary complexes, which had been reconstituted and purified as described in the legend to Fig. 1, were mixed and incubated in equimolar concentrations for 15 min in the dark. Then the assays were subjected to gel filtration. Individual fractions were harvested every 1 min, and aliquots were taken for radioactivity measurements in a liquid scintillation counter (A). Migration of marker proteins is indicated at the top. For tests on the presence of higher molecular weight complexes (B), fractions were pooled as follows: samples 1–4, fractions 1–60, containing 15 consecutive fractions each; sample 5, fractions 61–80; samples 6–16, fractions 81–104, containing two consecutive fractions each; sample 17, containing fractions 105–110; sample 18, containing fractions 112–116. In all cases, protein was recovered from the pooled fractions by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fraction 5, containing the pooled PORA-PORB supracomplexes, was analyzed further and supplemented with a mixed galacto- and sulfolipid fraction isolated from pigment-free prolamellar bodies of barley etioplasts (C). The curves show low temperature spectra at −196 °C (77 K) at an excitation wavelength of 440 nm before (solid line) and after (dashed line) a single, 1-ms flash of white light. Note the quantitative conversion of Pchlide F650/657 to Chlide F684/690.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the stoichiometry of the PORA and PORB in the recovered supracomplexes, fractions containing the different PORs were pooled (see Fig. 2 A) and separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was subjected to autoradiography. This experiment revealed that in the recovered higher molecular weight complex about five PORA-Pchlideb-NADPH ternary complexes interacted with just one PORB-Pchlide a-NADPH complex (Fig. 2 B, fraction 5).The oligomeric PORA-PORB protein complex contained in fraction 5 was subsequently supplemented with a lipid mixture containing monogalactosyl diacylglycerol, digalactosyl diacylglycerol, and sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (58:36:6 mol %), which had been prepared from pigment-free prolamellar bodies of barley etioplasts (5Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Then low temperature measurements were performed at 77 K, in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences spectrometer LS50B (23Lebedev N. van Cleve B. Armstrong G.A. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 2081-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2 C (solid line) demonstrates that two fluorescence peaks could be seen at an excitation wavelength of 440 nm: one at 657 nm and the other at 632 nm. Because these two peaks corresponded to photoactive Pchlide 650/657 and photoinactive Pchlide F628/632, known from the prolamellar body of etioplasts (e.g. Ref. 5Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we exposed the lipid-containing complex to a saturating 1-ms flash of white light. As shown in Fig. 2 C(dashed line), this gave rise to the quantitative conversion of Pchlide F650/657 to Chlide 684/690.We next extracted pigments from the flashed sample with acetone (see above) and ran HPLC analyses, as described in Ref. 14Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar. Separation on a C18 column is shown in Fig. 3 A. As demonstrated in an accompanying paper (32Reinbothe, S., Pollmann, S. & Reinbothe, C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 800–806Google Scholar), the pigment peak eluting at ∼12.5 min is identical with Pchlide b, whereas the peak eluting at ∼15 min is identical with Pchlide a (Fig. 3 A,panel a). Upon flash light illumination, a novel peak appeared at ∼14 min (Fig. 3 A, panel b). Based on our previous in vitro reconstitution experiments, we assumed that this peak might be due to Chlidea. To demonstrate this, another type of HPLC analysis was performed. Taking into account a recent paper of Fraser et al. (19Fraser P.D. Pinto E.M.S. Holloway D.E. Bramley P.M. Plant J. 2000; 24: 551-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a C30 column was used. Synthetic Chlides aand b were prepared by the chlorophyllase reaction (34McFeeters R.F. Chichester C.O. Whitaker J.R. Plant Physiol. 1971; 47: 609-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used as standards. Fig. 3 B (panel c) shows that Chlide a and Chlide b were well resolved on the C30 column and also separated from Chl a and Chl b. When the pigments, eluting at ∼14 min on the C18 column (see Fig. 3 A), were applied to the C30 column, the only detectable pigment was Chlide a (Fig. 3 B,panel d). Thus, only Chlide a had been produced upon flash light illumination of the reconstituted complex (Table I). By contrast, Pchlideb, which was ∼5-fold more abundant than Pchlidea, did not seem to be photoconvertible at all under the tested conditions. Indeed, no Chlide b was formed (TableI).Figure 3Photoconversion of Pchlide a, but not Pchlide b, in the reconstituted complex. Higher molecular weight POR-pigment complexes were reconstituted and incubated with a mixed galacto- and sulfolipid fraction of barley prolamellar bodies as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The lipid-containing complex in turn was subjected to a single, saturating flash of white light. Pigments were extracted with 100% acetone containing 0.1% (v/v) diethyl pyrocarbonate and analyzed by HPLC. A, separation of natural pigments on a C18 column. Absorbance measurements were made at 455 nm, which corresponds to the Soret band of Pchlide b. The chromatograms show pigments before (a) and after (b) light exposure. The pigment eluting at ∼12.5 min corresponds to Pchlide b, whereas Pchlide a has a retention time of ∼15 min (32Reinbothe, S., Pollmann, S. & Reinbothe, C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 800–806Google Scholar).B, identification of Chlide a by HPLC on a C30 column. Synthetic standards (panel c, Chlideb (16.25 min), Chl b (17.5 min), Chlidea (19.5 min), and Chl a (21 min)) were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods” and separated on a C30 column. Absorbance measurements were made at 435 nm. The pigment eluting at 14 min on the C18 column (A, panel b) was run in parallel (panel d); it corresponds to Chlide a.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IQuantification of pigments before and after flash light illumination of the reconstituted, lipid-containing complexPigmentPigment (percentage of total)NonflashedFlashed%%Pchlide a224Pchlideb7876ChlideaND20ChlidebNDNDPigments were extracted from the flashed and nonflashed sample with 100% acetone containing 0.1% (v/v) DEP and separated and identified by HPLC as described under “Materials and Methods.” Pigment levels refer to the sum of all detected pigments, set as 100. ND, nondetectable pigment levels. Open table in a new tab An explanation for these findings could be that the PORA was per se inactive with Pchlide b and thus unable to convert the pigment to Chlide b. If so, no Chlide bshould be produced also in situ. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed pigments that were formed in isolated prolamellar bodies upon flash light illumination by HPLC. Fig. 4 shows a representative separation of pigments before (A) and after (B) a saturating 1-ms flash of white light. In addition to Pchlide b and Pchlide a, eluting at 12.5 and 15 min, respectively (Fig. 4 A), 7-hydroxy-Pchlide a could also be detected (peak 1) (for details, see Ref. 32Reinbothe, S., Pollmann, S. & Reinbothe, C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 800–806Google Scholar). Upon flashing the sample, a novel pigment peak appeared (Fig. 4 B,peak 4), the retention time and absorption properties of which were indistinguishable from those of Chlidea identified previously (data not shown, but see Fig. 3). At the same time, increasing amounts of Pchlide a(peak 3) were detectable. As shown in an accompanying paper (32Reinbothe, S., Pollmann, S. & Reinbothe, C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 800–806Google Scholar), barley etioplasts contain an enzyme called 7-formyl reductase that converts Pchlide b to Pchlidea via 7-hydroxy-Pchlide a (see also Ref. 14Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Upon resolution of pigments contained in peak 4by subsequent HPLC on a C30 column, indeed only Chlide a and no Chlide b was observed (data not shown).Figure 4Photoconversion of Pchlide a, but not Pchlide b, in isolated prolamellar bodies. Prolamellar bodies were isolated from barley etioplasts and either kept in darkness (A) or exposed to a 1-ms flash of white light (B). Pigments were separated by HPLC as described in Fig. 3 A and identified using synthetic 7-hydroxy-Pchlide a (peak 1), Pchlideb (peak 2), Pchlide a(peak 3), and Chlide a (peak 4) as standards (not shown, but see Ref. 32Reinbothe, S., Pollmann, S. & Reinbothe, C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 800–806Google Scholar). Note the limited amount of Chlide a in the illuminated sample and the relative increase in the level of Pchlide a, which is indicative of 7-formyl reductase activity present in barley etioplasts (see also an accompanying paper (32Reinbothe, S., Pollmann, S. & Reinbothe, C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 800–806Google Scholar)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As a second approach, the in vitro synthesized PORA was incubated with ZnPPb (which is chemically more inert than Pchlide b) and separated from nonbound pigment by gel filtration, and POR-pigment complexes eluted with the flow-through exposed to white light. Parallel samples were kept in darkness. As a control, the PORB was used.Fig. 5 shows representative room temperature fluorescence emission spectra of PORA- and PORB-bound pigments after their extraction with acetone. They revealed that the PORA indeed converted ZnPPb to zinc pheophorbideb (Fig. 5B). By analogy, also ZnPPa was converted to zinc pheophorbide a (Fig. 5 A). Also with the PORB, the same principal results were obtained (Fig. 5, Cand D, respectively). For either POR protein, a strict correlation was observed between the amounts of products formed and bound substrates, regardless of whether ZnPPa andb 2C. Reinbothe, F. Buhr, S. Pollmann, and S. Reinbothe, unpublished data. or Pchlides a and b had been used (Fig. 5).Figure 5Photoconversion of synthetic ZnPP aand ZnPP b by virtue of the PORA and PORB. A–D, PORA-ZnPPa-NADPH (A), PORA-ZnPPb-NADPH (B), PORB-ZnPPa-NADPH (C), and PORB-ZnPPb-NADPH (D) complexes were reconstituted in vitro and purified by gel filtration as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The different ternary complexes were then exposed to white light (L, dotted line) or kept in darkness (D, solid line) for 15 min. POR-substrate and POR-product complexes were extracted with acetone, and the released pigments were identified and quantified by fluorescence emission measurements at an excitation wavelength of 440 nm. The products of photoconversion, zinc pheophorbide a and zinc pheophorbide b, have emission maxima at 665 and 652 nm, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)All results presented thus far implied that the reconstituted, lipid-containing Pchlide a/b-POR protein complex may be identical with the presumed native complex in the prolamellar body of etioplasts. However, except for the spectroscopic data, no other line of evidence seemed to exist to support this notion. We consequently sought to identify the native complex by classical biochemical approaches and to compare its properties with those of the reconstituted complex.Ryberg and Sundqvist (26Ryberg M. Sundqvist C. Physiol. Plant. 1982; 56: 125-132Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar) had shown that isolated etioplast inner membranes from wheat can be resolved into different subfractions, designated prolamellar bodies and prothylakoids, respectively, based on their different buoyant densities in sucrose gradients. We readdressed this previous work for barley etioplasts and analyzed the abundance of the PORA and PORB after various steps of the plastid work-up procedure (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 6, already during the very first step of isolation of the so-called etioplast inner membranes (presumed to comprise prolamellar bodies and prothylakoids) (26Ryberg M. Sundqvist C. Physiol. Plant. 1982; 56: 125-132Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar), a major part of the PORA became soluble. The same effect was seen for oat and wheat etioplasts, which were analyzed in parallel (data not given). In all cases, subsequent steps of prolamellar body and prothylakoid separation turned out to correlate with a further solubilization of the PORA. This is shown for barley in Fig. 6. With etioplast inner membranes, which had been diluted with a buffer lacking any additives for membrane stabilization, the PORA was quantitatively released and then co-migrated in the uppermost fractions of a top-loaded 10–50% (w/w) sucrose density gradient. With barley etioplast inner membranes, which had been sonicated in a buffer containing 50% sucrose and loaded from the bottom, both the PORA and PORB appeared to be recovered in the lower parts of the gradient, containing prolamellar bodies. However, the approximately equimolar amounts of the PORA and PORB, which were at variance with their original stoichiometries in intact etioplasts, and the fact that both POR proteins migrated to slightly different positions in the gradient argued against working further with these samples.In a recent paper, Klement et al. (27Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 862-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) reported the isolation of a pigment-free POR protein from oat. Such a preparation seemed particularly interesting to us because it would allow testing of the pigment binding properties of the PORA and PORB in a more natural environment than in the in vitro system. In principal, the method of Klement et al. (27Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 862-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) employs differential detergent solubilization of POR from the prolamellar body.When we reproduced the published protocol and followed the fate of the PORA and PORB by Western blotting (Fig. 7), again drastic losses of the PORA during successive steps of the membrane preparation and solubilization procedure became apparent. In the final supernatant, approximately equal levels of the PORA and PORB were seen, which were at variance with the determined 5:1 protein stoichiometry in intact etioplasts. Moreover, subsequent chromatography on DEAE-cellulose gave rise to at least three different POR protein bands, representing the PORA, the PORB, and a slightly smaller degradation product (Fig. 7). To what extent these proteins would contribute to pigment binding could not be estimated.Figure 7Western blot analysis of POR-related proteins during the plastid work-up procedure of Klement et al.(27Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 862-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The blot shows POR-related proteins in intact etioplasts (Intact, lane 1), in lysed etioplasts (Lysed, lanes 2 and3), and in all of the different fractions obtained by stepwise detergent solubilization withn-octyl-β-d-glucoside (Solubilized,lanes 4–7). P and S, pellet and supernatant fraction, respectively. For DEAE-cellulose chromatography (Gradient fractionation), fraction S3 was used, and POR-related proteins eluted with a 5–20 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucoside (n-ODG) gradient (lanes 9–20). Lane 8 shows the flow-through. Note the progressive solubilization of the bulk of the 36-kDa PORA protein during the plastid work-up procedure and that some PORA appears in the pellet fraction P3. This may be due to the high detergent concentration, favoring membrane lipid disorganization. The identity of the lower band in lane 7 is unknown, but it may be generated by limited proteolysis of residual PORB. Noteworthy in this context is also the occurrence of several other degradation products of POR, designated DP1–DP3. In the ultimate POR protein preparation (pooled fractions F20–F24), at least three different POR proteins are found: PORA, PORB, and DP1, the pigment binding capacity of which is unknown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given this uncertainty and the fact that neither the method of Ryberg and Sundqvist (26Ryberg M. Sundqvist C. Physiol. Plant. 1982; 56: 125-132Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar) nor that of Klement et al. (27Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 862-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) allowed the recovery of an intact PORA-PORB protein complex, we sought alternative methods.

https://openalex.org/W2084938620,"We recently put forth a model of a protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) light-harvesting complex operative during angiosperm seedling de-etiolation (Reinbothe, C., Lebedev, N., and Reinbothe, S. (1999) Nature 397, 80–84). This model, which was based on in vitro reconstitution experiments with zinc analogs of Pchlide a and Pchlide b and the two NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductases (PORs), PORA and PORB, of barley, predicted a 5-fold excess of Pchlide b, relative to Pchlide a, in the prolamellar body of etioplasts. Recent work (Scheumann, V., Klement, H., Helfrich, M., Oster, U., Schoch, S., and Rüdiger, W. (1999) FEBS Lett. 445, 445–448), however, contradicted this model and reported that Pchlide b would not be present in etiolated plants. Here we demonstrate that Pchlide b is an abundant pigment in barley etioplasts but is rather metabolically unstable. It is rapidly converted to Pchlide a by virtue of 7-formyl reductase activity, an enzyme that had previously been implicated in the chlorophyll (Chl) b to Chl a reaction cycle. Our findings suggest that etiolated plants make use of 7-formyl reductase to fine tune the levels of Pchlide b and Pchlidea and thereby may regulate the steady-state level of light-harvesting POR-Pchlide complex. We recently put forth a model of a protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) light-harvesting complex operative during angiosperm seedling de-etiolation (Reinbothe, C., Lebedev, N., and Reinbothe, S. (1999) Nature 397, 80–84). This model, which was based on in vitro reconstitution experiments with zinc analogs of Pchlide a and Pchlide b and the two NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductases (PORs), PORA and PORB, of barley, predicted a 5-fold excess of Pchlide b, relative to Pchlide a, in the prolamellar body of etioplasts. Recent work (Scheumann, V., Klement, H., Helfrich, M., Oster, U., Schoch, S., and Rüdiger, W. (1999) FEBS Lett. 445, 445–448), however, contradicted this model and reported that Pchlide b would not be present in etiolated plants. Here we demonstrate that Pchlide b is an abundant pigment in barley etioplasts but is rather metabolically unstable. It is rapidly converted to Pchlide a by virtue of 7-formyl reductase activity, an enzyme that had previously been implicated in the chlorophyll (Chl) b to Chl a reaction cycle. Our findings suggest that etiolated plants make use of 7-formyl reductase to fine tune the levels of Pchlide b and Pchlidea and thereby may regulate the steady-state level of light-harvesting POR-Pchlide complex. protochlorophyllide chlorophyllide chlorophyll diethyl pyrocarbonate high performance liquid chromatography light-harvesting POR-Pchlide complex NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase zinc protopheophorbide. Angiosperms have developed sophisticated mechanisms to harvest sunlight and to convert this into various physiological responses (1Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. Nijhoff, Dordrecht1994Crossref Google Scholar). They make use of various photoreceptors, such as the red/far red light-absorbing phytochromes, the blue light-absorbing cryptochromes, and the blue light-absorbing phototropins, to adapt to different light qualities and quantities and to sense the direction and duration of incident light (for a review, see Ref. 2Neff M.M. Fankhauser C. Chory J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 257-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these photoreceptors are chromoproteins, which undergo characteristic spectral changes upon illumination. Another blue and red light-absorbing protein-pigment complex is the protochlorophyllide (Pchlide)1 holochrome (3Boardman N.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 62: 63-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is localized in the prolamellar body of etioplasts. These plastids form when angiosperms germinate in darkness. The entire developmental process of seedling germination leading to prolamellar bodies is termed skotomorphogenesis or etiolation (1Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. Nijhoff, Dordrecht1994Crossref Google Scholar). In plants displaying an hypogeic type of germination, it takes place underneath the soil. The newborn seedlings then utilize all nutrient reserves contained in the seed to bring the cotyledons above the soil. Previous work has shown that the Pchlide holochrome is a higher molecular mass complex of about 600 kDa (3Boardman N.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 62: 63-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). More recent work suggested that it may be composed of galacto- and sulfolipids (4Ryberg M. Sandelius A.S. Selstam E. Physiol. Plant. 1983; 57: 555-560Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), Pchlide (5Houssier C. Sauer K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,6Griffiths W.T. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and an enzyme called the NADPH:Pchlide oxidoreductase (POR; EC1.3.33.1) (7Griffiths W.T. FEBS Lett. 1974; 49: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Apel K. Santel H.-J. Redlinger T.E. Falk H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It was discovered that two distinct forms of POR exist in barley etioplasts, called PORA and PORB (9Schulz R. Steinmüller K. Klaas M. Forreiter C. Rasmussen S. Hiller C. Apel K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 217: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 10Holtorf H. Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Bereza B. Apel K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3254-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Moreover, two species of Pchlide have been distinguished in isolated prolamellar bodies by low temperature in situ fluorescence measurements: Pchlide 628/632 (the first number indicates the absorption maximum, the second the respective fluorescence emission maximum at the chosen excitation wavelength) and Pchlide 650/657 (for a review, see Ref. 11Lebedev N. Timko M.P. Photosynthesis Res. 1998; 58: 5-23Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Whereas the former remained quantitatively unchanged upon illumination with a single, 1-ms flash of white light, the latter was readily converted to Chlide 684/690. This differential behavior led scientists to name Pchlide 628/632 photoinactive and Pchlide 650/657 photoactive (summarized in Ref. 11Lebedev N. Timko M.P. Photosynthesis Res. 1998; 58: 5-23Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Both before and after flash light illumination, energy transfer was observed, taking place from photoinactive Pchlide to photoactive Pchlide in etiolated plants and from photoinactive Pchlide to Chlide in preflashed plants (12Smith J.H.C. Benitez A. Plant Physiol. 1954; 29: 135-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kahn A. Boardman N.K. Thorne S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Mathis P.

Domanskii V.P. Kolyago V.M. Photosynthetica. 1993; 29: 227-234Google Scholar). To resolve all of these puzzling previous observations, we proposed a model of a “light-harvesting POR-Pchlide” complex, named LHPP (18Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Based on in vitro reconstitution experiments with synthetic zinc analogs of Pchlide, we put forth the idea that LHPP may be composed of 5 PORA-Pchlide b-NADPH ternary complexes and 1 PORB-Pchlide a-NADPH ternary complex embedded into the lipid bilayers of the prolamellar body of etioplasts (18Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (see also Ref. 19Willows R. Nature. 1999; 397: 27-28Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholarfor a summary). A particularly important question that had thus far remained unanswered was whether Pchlide b implicit in the LHPP model would be present in etiolated barley plants. Whereas previous work had indicated that Pchlide b is present in green plants (20Shedbalkar V.P. Ioannides I.M. Rebeiz C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17151-17157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no comparable study had thus far been available reporting the identification of Pchlide b in etiolated plants, where the pigment, according to our in vitro reconstitution experiments (18Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar), should be found in maximum levels. In a recent paper, Scheumann et al. (21Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) even generally questioned the existence of Pchlide b, but at the same time demonstrated that barley etioplasts rapidly convert exogenously added zinc protopheophorbide b (ZnPPb) to ZnPPa. This prompted us to conclude that Chl(ide) b reductase, presumably responsible for this conversion (22Ito H. Tanaka Y. Tsuji H. Tanaka A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 23Ito H. Takaichi S. Tsuji H. Tanaka A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35102-35108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), could also metabolize the endogenously occurring Pchlide b to Pchlidea. In the present study, we readdressed the experimental design of Scheumann et al. (21Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that Chl(ide)b reductase (which may alternatively be named 7-formyl reductase; see below) is indeed able to convert Pchlide b to Pchlide a in situ. This reaction already occurs upon plastid lysis and subsequent detergent solubilization of isolated prolamellar bodies. Both experimental steps lead to a denaturation of the prolamellar body and the release of the PORA and make Pchlideb readily accessible to 7-formyl reductase. Our results provoke the idea that 7-formyl reductase may be involved in fine tuning the levels of Pchlide b and Pchlide a in etioplasts. All glassware used throughout this study was pretreated with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEP). This compound had previously been shown to inhibit bacterial and plant Rieske-type oxygenases (27Ohnishi T. Meinhardt S.W. von Jagow W. Yagi T. Hatefi Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 28Caliebe A. Grimm R. Kaiser G. Lübeck J. Soll J. Heins L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7342-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), to which Chlide a oxygenase and related enzymes belong (29Tanaka A. Ito H. Tanaka R. Tanaka N.K. Yoshida K. Okada K. Proc.

Nature. 1999; 400: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To block this activity seemed particularly necessary, in order to allow accurate determination of Pchlidea and Pchlide b levels, respectively. Pigments were extracted from intact barley etioplasts as described herein and in Ref. 31Reinbothe C. Buhr F. Pollmann S. Reinbothe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar. Separation by HPLC was performed on a C18 reverse phase silica gel column (Macherey-Nagel Co., 250 × 4.6 mm, Nucleosil ODS 5 μm) as described in Ref. 32Schoch S. Helfrich M. Wiktorsson B. Sundqvist C. Rüdiger W. Ryberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar. Either a step gradient was used, starting with 34% 25 mm aqueous ammonium acetate, 15% acetone, and 51% methanol (buffer A), increasing to 16% H2O, 60% acetone, and 24% methanol within 20 min (buffer B), and finally to 100% acetone another 4 min later, or linear gradients from buffer A to buffer B. Absorbance measurements were made at 455 nm, which corresponds to the Soret band of Pchlide b, to detect and quantify Pchlide aand Pchlide b levels. At this wavelength, the extinction coefficients of Pchlide b and Pchlide a are 5-fold different (21Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As internal standards, we used synthetic Pchlides a and b, which were prepared from Chlides a and b with an excess of 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone as described in Refs. 21Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar and 32Schoch S. Helfrich M. Wiktorsson B. Sundqvist C. Rüdiger W. Ryberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar. At a flow rate of 1 ml/min, Pchlide a has a retention time of ∼15 min, and Pchlide b has a retention time of ∼12.5 min. For simultaneous separation of Pchlide a and Pchlideb and their reduced products (i.e. Chlidesa and b, respectively), a C30 reverse phase column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; YMC Inc., Willmington, NC) (33Fraser P.D. Pinto E.M.S. Holloway D.E. Bramley P.M. Plant J. 2000; 24: 551-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used. HPLC was performed in a Varian ProStar model 410 apparatus, a ProStar model 240 pump, and a ProStar 330 photodiode array detector, essentially as described in Ref. 33Fraser P.D. Pinto E.M.S. Holloway D.E. Bramley P.M. Plant J. 2000; 24: 551-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar (see accompanying paper (31Reinbothe C. Buhr F. Pollmann S. Reinbothe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) for details). In some experiments, a combination of octadecyl silica and poly(ethylene) powder media was used, likewise allowing separation of both porphyrins and chlorins in the same HPLC run (34Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 862-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Chemical synthesis of ZnPPa and ZnPPb and their binding to isolated prolamellar body membranes was performed as described in Ref. 32Schoch S. Helfrich M. Wiktorsson B. Sundqvist C. Rüdiger W. Ryberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar. 7-Hydroxy-Pchlide a was synthesized as described herein. Liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry was performed in an m-nitrobenzyl alcohol matrix with a Finnigan model MAT900 and a cesium gun (20 kV, 1 mA) according to Schochet al. (32Schoch S. Helfrich M. Wiktorsson B. Sundqvist C. Rüdiger W. Ryberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Etioplasts were prepared from etiolated barley plants by Percoll density gradient centrifugation as described previously (35Reinbothe S. Krauspe R. Parthier B. Planta. 1990; 181: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,36Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Runge S. Apel K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For low temperature analyses at 77 K (see below) and pigment measurements (see above), the etioplast suspension was directly used. Plastids to be lysed and further subfractionated were diluted with the buffer described by Li et al. (37Li H. Moore T. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). After sedimentation, the latter plastids were fractionated into prolamellar bodies, prothylakoids, and stroma, on discontinuous step gradients of sucrose (38Reinbothe S. Runge S. Reinbothe C. van Cleve B. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). n-Octyl-β-d-glucoside treatment of isolated prolamellar bodies was performed as described in Ref. 21Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar. After solubilization, the assay mixtures were centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant and membrane fractions were analyzed separately as specified herein. Etioplasts prepared on a Percoll gradient were extracted with an 100-fold excess of either 100% acetone containing 0.1% DEP or only 80% acetone lacking DEP. By analogy, plastid subfractions obtained as described above were treated identically. Protein was recovered by centrifugation, washed several times with ethanol and ether, and run by SDS-PAGE on 10–20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gradients, whereas pigments found in the corresponding supernatant fractions were directly used for fluorescence measurements (see below). Immunodecoration of electrophoretically resolved proteins was performed using an ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences) and an anti-POR-specific antiserum (9Schulz R. Steinmüller K. Klaas M. Forreiter C. Rasmussen S. Hiller C. Apel K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 217: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Low temperature fluorescence measurements were performed at 77 K at an excitation wavelength of 440 nm (39Lebedev N. van Cleve B. Armstrong G.A. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 2081-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in a spectrometer LS50B (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Previous studies had shown that barley and cucumber etioplasts contain enzyme activity that converts Chl b to Chla (22Ito H. Tanaka Y. Tsuji H. Tanaka A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). By analogy, this enzyme activity was found to also convert the nonesterified precursor of Chl b, Chlideb, as well as pyrochlorophyllide b and the magnesium-free pheophorbide b into the respective Chla and 7-hydroxy compounds (23Ito H. Takaichi S. Tsuji H. Tanaka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22034-22038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ito H. Ohtsuka T. Tanaka A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35102-35108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To test whether this enzyme activity, which we tentatively named 7-formyl reductase to indicate this broad substrate specificity, would also be able to convert Pchlide b to Pchlide a in situ, we followed the experimental design of Scheumann et al. (21Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, intact barley etioplasts were isolated on a Percoll gradient, sedimented by centrifugation, lysed, and incubated with ZnPPb, the zinc analog of Pchlide b (32Schoch S. Helfrich M. Wiktorsson B. Sundqvist C. Rüdiger W. Ryberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As a control, barley etioplasts were left intact (26Scheumann V. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35102-35108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and incubated identically. Mock incubations lacking ZnPPb were conducted in parallel. Two different pigment extraction procedures were used. In the first case, we used an almost pure, nonaqueous solution of acetone containing 0.1% DEP, which was used in order to block the potential generation of Pchlide b by virtue of the previously identified Chlidea oxygenase and related enzymes (27Ohnishi T. Meinhardt S.W. von Jagow W. Yagi T. Hatefi Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 28Caliebe A. Grimm R. Kaiser G. Lübeck J. Soll J. Heins L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7342-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 29Tanaka A. Ito H. Tanaka R. Tanaka N.K. Yoshida K. Okada K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1999; 400: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This solution is referred to as 100% acetone throughout the rest of the paper. In the second case, an aqueous, non-DEP-supplemented solution containing only 80% acetone was used, as reported in Ref. 21Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar. Pigment analyses were made by HPLC, using a photodiode array detector. As shown previously (21Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Schoch S. Helfrich M. Wiktorsson B. Sundqvist C. Rüdiger W. Ryberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), this allowed simultaneous separation and identification of pigments during the actual HPLC run. When etiolated leaf material was extracted with 100% acetone, HPLC analyses revealed the existence of three main porphyrin species, eluting at 11 min (peak 1), 12.5 min (peak 2), and 15 min (peak 3), respectively (Fig. 1 A). Depending on the steepness of the solvent gradient and actual flow rate, some variations in the retention times were seen (see also Fig. 4). The relative peak intensities, however, were maintained. This at first glance indicated that the pigments contained in peak 2 were more abundant than those resolved in peaks 1 and 3 (Fig. 1 A). By contrast, when replicate etioplast samples were extracted with only 80% acetone (21Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the level of pigment in peak 3 seemed to largely exceed those contained in the other fractions (Fig. 1 B). Only traces of peak 2 were seen, and peak 1 remained even below the level of detection.Figure 4In situ conversion of Pchlide b to Pchlide a. Etioplasts were isolated from dark-grown barley plants, lysed, and fractionated into prolamellar bodies and stroma. The prolamellar body fraction in turn was solubilized with n-octyl-β-d-glucoside. Pigments were extracted with 100% acetone containing 0.1% (v/v) DEP and analyzed by HPLC (see Fig. 1). The different chromatograms show absorbance readings of porphyrin pigments in intact etioplasts (A), lysed etioplasts (B), and solubilized prolamellar bodies (C). Peaks 1–3correspond to those shown in Fig. 1. The insets show respective quantitative data. Percentages hereby refer to the sum of Pchlide a (gray columns,lanes 1, 3, and 5) and Pchlide b (white columns,lanes 2, 4, and 6) in the different samples, set as 100.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Absorbance profiles of the resolved pigments are shown in Fig. 2. They demonstrated that the pigments contained in peak 2 had a main absorption maximum at 448 nm and two lower maxima at 578 and 622 nm, respectively (Fig. 2 B). These corresponded to values reported previously for Pchlideb: the so-called Soret band (448 nm), the Qxband (578 nm), and the Qy band (622 nm) (21Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The Qx band had a higher absorbance than the Qyband, which is a typical feature of all investigated pigments of the proto b series (21Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Schoch S. Helfrich M. Wiktorsson B. Sundqvist C. Rüdiger W. Ryberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For the pigments contained in peak 3, a main absorption maximum at 438 nm and a second, lower band at 628 nm were observed (Fig. 2 C). These maxima are characteristics of Pchlidea (5Houssier C. Sauer K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Griffiths W.T. FEBS Lett. 1974; 49: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The absorption spectrum of pigments contained in peak 1 was similar to that of the pigments resolved in peak 3; however, the minor peak seemed slightly blue-shifted (Fig. 2 A), suggesting the presence of 7-OH-Pchlide a (21Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To prove the identity of the various compounds, synthetic standards were prepared. 7-Hydroxy-Chl a, Chl b, and Chla were used as educts in a combined enzymatic and chemical procedure (21Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Schoch S. Helfrich M. Wiktorsson B. Sundqvist C. Rüdiger W. Ryberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the first step, the phytol chain was removed by the chlorophyllase reaction (40McFeeters R.F. Chichester C.O. Whitaker J.R. Plant Physiol. 1971; 47: 609-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the second step, the double bond in ring D of the macrocycle was reestablished by chemical dehydrogenation with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone (21Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Schoch S. Helfrich M. Wiktorsson B. Sundqvist C. Rüdiger W. Ryberg M. Eur. J.

It became apparent that the absorption maxima and the shapes of the curves were identical to those known from the literature (e.g. Refs. 24Ito H. Ohtsuka T. Tanaka A. J. Biol.

After hydrolysis of the pigments by virtue of the chlorophyllase reaction, giving rise to Chlidea, Chlide b, and 7-hydroxy-Chlide a, respectively, basically the same spectra were obtained (Fig. 3 B), which is in agreement with previous findings that the phytol chain in the esterified pigments does not affect their absorption properties as compared with the nonesterified pigments (e.g. Refs. 21Scheumann V.

Upon oxidation with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone, striking changes occurred in the absorption properties of all three compounds, however. For Chlideb and Chlide a, spectra were obtained (Fig. 3 C) that were indistinguishable from those shown in Fig. 2,B and C, respectively, indicating the production of Pchlide b and Pchlide a. The spectrum of 7-hydroxy-Pchlide a was very similar to that of Pchlidea but was slightly blue-shifted in the red region of the spectrum (Fig. 3 C versus Fig. 2 A). Mass spectrometry was used to further characterize the chemically prepared and natural compounds. Table Ishows that the molecular ion peaks at m/z612.4 ± 0.2, 626.9 ± 0.3, and 628.4 ± 0.2 were indistinguishable for the natural and synthetic pigments. According to previous work, they correspond to 7-hydroxy-Pchlide a(m/z 628.4), Pchlide b (m/z 626.9), and Pchlide a (m/z 612.4) (21Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W.

These results thus ultimately confirmed the presence of 7-OH-Pchlide a, Pchlide b, and Pchlide a in etiolated barley leaves.Table IIdentification of natural and synthetic pigments by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometryPigmentm/zNaturalSynthetic7-OH-Pchlidea628.4628.2Pchlideb626.9626.6Pchlidea612.4612.4m/z values were obtained from mass spectra of the molecular ion regions of the various chemically pure compounds as described in Refs. 21Scheumann V.

https://openalex.org/W2159302378,"We investigated the roles of hydrophobic deoxycholic acid (DCA) and hydrophilic ursocholic acid (UCA) in the regulation of the orphan nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in vivo. Rabbits with bile fistula drainage (removal of the endogenous bile acid pool), rabbits with bile fistula drainage and replacement with either DCA or UCA, and intact rabbits fed 0.5% cholic acid (CA) (enlarged endogenous bile acid pool) were studied. After bile fistula drainage, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) mRNA and activity levels increased, FXR-mediated transcription was decreased, and FXR mRNA and nuclear protein levels declined. Replacing the enterohepatic bile acid pool with DCA restored FXR mRNA and nuclear protein levels and activated FXR-mediated transcription as evidenced by the increased expression of its target genes, SHP and BSEP, and decreased CYP7A1 mRNA level and activity. Replacing the bile acid pool with UCA also restored FXR mRNA and nuclear protein levels but did not activate FXR-mediated transcription, because the SHP mRNA level and CYP7A1 mRNA level and activity were unchanged. Feeding CA to intact rabbits expanded the bile acid pool enriched with the FXR high affinity ligand, DCA. FXR-mediated transcription became activated as shown by increased SHP and BSEP mRNA levels and decreased CYP7A1 mRNA level and activity but did not change FXR mRNA or nuclear protein levels. Thus, both hydrophobic and hydrophilic bile acids are effective in maintaining FXR mRNA and nuclear protein levels. However, the activating ligand (DCA) in the enterohepatic flux is necessary for FXR-mediated transcriptional regulation, which leads to down-regulation of CYP7A1.

Based on in vitrostudies in cell culture, the most effective (high affinity) ligands for FXR activation are chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), and lithocholic acid (LA), which are all hydrophobic bile acids. In contrast, hydrophilic bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic acid and muricholic acid are not effective. Wang et al. (1Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar) reported that in CV-1 cells co-transfected with bile acid transporters, free cholic acid (CA), and the glycine or taurine conjugates of CA, DCA, and LA, which now are hydrophilic, became strong activators of FXR comparable with free CDCA Recently, other target genes for FXR have been identified that are positively regulated, including the bile salt export pump (BSEP), which is responsible for the canalicular transport of bile acids (4Ananthanarayanan M.

FXR/RXR does not bind directly to the bile acid response element in the promoter region of human CYP7A1 (7Chiang J.Y.L. Kimmel R. Weinberger C. Stroup D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10918-10924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar); thus, CYP7A1 transcriptional down-regulation by bile acids via FXR is indirect via SHP (5Lu T.T.

The increased SHP is believed to inactivate liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), an essential transcription factor forCYP7A1 expression (8Nitta M., Ku, S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6660-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Recently, Chen et al. (9Chen W. Owsley E. Yang Y. Stroup D. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1402-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that α-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF), a human homolog of mouse LRH-1, was an inhibitor rather than a transcription factor for CYP7A1. More recently, studies in SHPknock-out mice (10Kerr T.A. Saeku S. Schneider M. Schaefer K. Berdy S. Redder T. Shan B. Russell D.W. Schwartz M. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 713-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 11Wang L. Lee Y.-K. Bundman D. Han Y. Thevananther S. Kim C.-S. Chua S.S. Wel P. Heyman R.A. Karin M. Moore D.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) suggested that CYP7A1 could also be regulated by bile acids through SHP-independent pathways, because cholic acid feeding to the SHP −/− mice also repressedCYP7A1 expression. Therefore, the mechanism by which activated FXR down-regulates CYP7A1 has not been completely elucidated. To examine the proposed theories of the role of bile acids in FXR activation and the regulation of CYP7A1 under in vivoconditions, this study was carried out in rabbits with depleted bile acid pool/flux, which was replaced with either hydrophobic DCA or hydrophilic ursocholic acid (UCA), and intact rabbits fed cholic acid. In addition, the effect of these bile acids on FXR transcription was also evaluated. Male New Zealand White (NZW) (n = 24) rabbits weighing 2.5–2.75 kg (Convance, Denver, PA) were used in this study. Sixteen rabbits were fed regular rabbit chow, and eight rabbits were fed regular chow containing 0.5% CA (Purina Mills, St Louis, MO) for 7 days. Bile fistulas were constructed in 12/16 regular chow-fed rabbits and 4/8 0.5% CA chow-fed rabbits as described previously (12Xu G. Salen G. Shefer S. Tint G.S. Nguyen L.B. Chen T.S. Greenblatt D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Bile drainage was continued for 7 days to ensure the complete elimination of bile acids returning to the liver. The secondary bile acid, DCA, a high-affinity ligand for FXR, totally disappeared from the hepatic bile after 5 days of bile drainage, indicating interruption of the intestinal bile acid flux through the liver. Four of the twelve rabbits with 7 days of bile fistula drainage were sacrificed to collect liver specimens, which were immediately frozen for measurements of FXR, SHP, BSEP, and FTF (LRH-1) mRNA levels, FXR/RXR and FTF nuclear protein levels, and CYP7A1 mRNA levels and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity. The sodium salts of glyco-DCA and glyco-UCA were dissolved in water. In the bile acid depleted rabbits, after bile acid synthesis was maximally stimulated and bile acid output became constant, glyco-DCA (n = 4) and glyco-UCA (n = 4) were then infused intraduodenally. The baseline bile acid flux was determined by measuring the bile acid output for 30 min immediately after construction of the bile fistula. To ensure sufficient hepatic bile acid replacement, glyco-DCA or glyco-UCA were infused at a rate of 60 mg (conjugated bile acid) per hour for 24 h. After completion of the studies, rabbits, including chow-fed controls and 0.5% CA fed, were sacrificed, and liver tissues were taken immediately for analysis. The animal protocol was approved by the Subcommittee on Animal Studies at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, East Orange, NJ and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Medicine and Dentistry-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ. For the preparation of nuclear extracts, liver was minced and homogenized with a Wheaton Dounce homogenizer (pestle B) in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol. Nuclei were separated by centrifugation at 1800 × g for 5 min suspended in the same lysis buffer that now contained a high salt concentration (500 mm NaCl). The nuclei were broken with a homogenizer (pestle A). After centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant (nuclear extract) was collected and divided into aliquots and stored at −70 °C. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. The response element used as an FXR-specific probe was a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the sequence 5′-AAGGTCAATGACCTTA-3′ and, for the complementary strand, 5′-TAAGGTCATTGACCTT-3′. The sequences of the mutant probe were 5′-AAGAACAATGTTCTTA-3′ and 5′-TAAGAACATTGTTCTT-3′. The response element for FTF protein analysis contained the sequence 5′-GTTCAAGGCCAGTTACTACCA-3′ as the top strand and 5′-TGGTAGTAACTGGCCTTGAAC-3′ as the complementary strand. These probes were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. In the gel shift assay for the FTF protein, a standard FTF was applied to identify the FTF protein in the nuclear protein extracts. The standard FTF lysate was synthesized in vitro using a TnT T7 Quick Coupled transcription/translation system from Promega (Madison, WI) with the expression vectors pCMX.hCPF or pCDM8.hFTF (from Dr. B. Forman and Dr. J. Chiang, respectively). The binding reaction contained 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 20 mmHepes (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, and 3% glycerol. Unlabeled competitor probes (mutant or normal response element) were added at 100-fold excess and were pre-incubated with the extracted nuclear proteins (10 μg) on ice for 30 min before adding the 32P-labeled probe. After a 1-h incubation with the labeled probe (0.06 pmol, 25,000 cpm) on ice, the reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis through an 8% polyacrylamide gel in 0.375× TBE (0.33 mm Tris borate (pH 8.7) and 1.0 mm EDTA). The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Total RNA was isolated from frozen rabbit liver tissue using single-step RNA isolation method with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) as described by Chomozynski and Sacchi (13Chomozynski R. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63139) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 2 mg of total RNA by oligo(dT)-cellulose using the FastTrack 2.0 mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen) described by Biesecker et al. (14Biesecker L.G. Gottschalk L.R. Emerson S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7044-7048Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). When the RNA was used for reverse transcription PCR, total RNA (1 μg) was digested with (10 units) RNase-free DNase I (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The following degenerate oligonucleotide primers were used to clone partial rabbit cDNAs for FXR, SHP, andFTF for FXR, 5MP, andFTF: FXR primer, 5′-TATGAACTCAGGCGWATG-3′ and 5′-GTGAGTTCMGTTTTCTCC-3′; SHP primer, 5′-CTCAGGAACCTGCCRTC-3′ and 5′-GYTCCAGGACTTCACACA-3′; and FTF primer, 5′-ATGATGAAGATCTGGAAGAG-3′ and 5′ACAAAGGGACTTCTGTCATA-3′. For rabbit cDNA cloning, cDNAs were prepared as described by Ullrich et al. (15Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Downward J. Mayes E.L.V. Whittle N. Waterfield M.D. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA was obtained from 1 μg of rabbit liver total RNA by reverse transcription and then digested by RNase H to degrade the RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Omniscript reverse transcription kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The first-strand cDNA in the mixture with the sense and antisense degenerate primer oligonucleotides was subjected to PCR using a HotStarTaq master mix kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Thermocycler. The PCR was run for 30 cycles (30 s at 94 °C; 30 s at 50–60 °C for different primers; and 60 s at 72 °C). An aliquot of the reaction product was electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose gel. When only a single band was visualized by ethidium bromide staining at the expected size, the PCR product was cloned by a TOPO TA cloning kit for sequencing (Invitrogen). At least six clones that contained the PCR product from each rabbit gene studied were sequenced by the Applied Biosystems Division automated 3700 DNA analyzer using Big Dye Terminator chemistry and AmpliTaq-FS DNA Polymerase. For RNA probe synthesis and Northern blot analysis, rabbit RNA probes were synthesized by the Strip-EZ RNA probe synthesis and removal kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and labeled with [α-32P]UTP using cloned cDNA as a template. Northern blot hybridization was performed as previously described by Thomas (16Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5859) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was electrophoresed on a formaldehyde-agarose (1.0%) gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Nytran supercharge nylon transfer membrane, Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was baked for 1 h at 80 °C and hybridized to a 32P-labeled RNA probe for 16 h at 60 °C. The membrane was washed at 68 °C in 0.1× SSC 0.1% SDS for 30 min. Relative expression levels were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and standardized against cyclophilin controls. Hepatic microsomes were prepared by differential ultracentrifugation (17Shefer S. Salen G. Batta A.K. Methods of Assay: Cholesterol 7α-Hydroxylase (7α-Monooxygenase). CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1986: 43-49Google Scholar). Protein was determined according to Lowry et al. (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CYP7A1 activity was measured in hepatic microsomes by the isotope incorporation method of Shefer et al. (17Shefer S. Salen G. Batta A.K. Methods of Assay: Cholesterol 7α-Hydroxylase (7α-Monooxygenase). CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1986: 43-49Google Scholar). Bile acids were analyzed using a capillary gas-liquid chromatography method as previously described (12Xu G. Salen G. Shefer S. Tint G.S. Nguyen L.B. Chen T.S. Greenblatt D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Data are shown as means ± S.D. and were compared statistically by Student's t test (unpaired). The BMDP statistical software (BMDP Statistical Software, Los Angeles, CA) was used for statistical evaluations. As we have described previously (12Xu G. Salen G. Shefer S. Tint G.S. Nguyen L.B. Chen T.S. Greenblatt D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), after 7 days of bile fistula drainage the secondary bile acid, DCA, disappeared from the hepatic bile, which indicated that the enterohepatic bile acid pool/flux was totally depleted and that no further intestinal bile acids had returned to the liver. Removal of the bile acid pool/flux increased CYP7A1 mRNA levels 2.3-fold and activity 5.7-fold (p < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 1). FXR/RXR nuclear protein levels measured by gel shift assays (Fig. 2) were reduced 65% (p < 0.01), and FXR mRNA levels (Figs. 3 and 4) decreased 41% (p < 0.05). The levels of FXR target genes SHP and BSEP mRNAs decreased 82% (p < 0.01) and 58% (p< 0.05), respectively (Figs. 5 and 6). However, there was no change in FTF nuclear protein (Fig. 7) or mRNA levels (Fig. 8).Figure 2FXR/RXR nuclear protein measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.

At baseline, the hepatic bile acid pool/flux in these rabbits measured within the first half-hour immediately after bile fistula drainage was 30 ± 10 mg/h with 85% DCA and 13% CA. After replacement with sodium glyco-UCA, the bile acid pool/flux was restored to 46 ± 8 mg/h, of which 82% was UCA (38 ± 8 mg/h) with 17% CA and 0.6% DCA. Replacement with DCA decreased CYP7A1 mRNA 54% (p < 0.01) and activity 55% (p < 0.01), whereas replacing the flux with UCA had no effect (Fig. 1 ). FXR mRNA levels and FXR/RXR nuclear protein increased significantly and recovered to baseline levels after the bile acid flux was restored with either DCA (hydrophobic) or UCA (hydrophilic) for 24 h (Figs. 2 and 3). SHP and BSEP mRNA levels increased 3.7-fold (p < 0.001) and 2-fold (p < 0.05), respectively, 24 h after replacement with DCA as compared with the low levels in rabbits with depleted bile acid pools (Figs. 5 and 6). In contrast, when the hepatic bile acid pool/flux was reestablished with UCA, there was no change in SHP mRNA level but a 49% rise in BSEP mRNA (Figs. 5 and 6). Feeding 0.5% cholic acid to intact rabbits for 7 days expanded the bile acid pool size 2-fold from 306 ± 25 mg to 605 ± 72 mg (p < 0.01), and the hepatic bile acid flux increased 2.7-fold (83 ± 6 mg/hversus 30 ± 10 mg/h, p < 0.001) with 89% DCA. The CYP7A1 mRNA level was inhibited 67% (p < 0.001), and activity decreased 72% (7 ± 2versus 25 ± 9 pmol/mg/min, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1). However, the FXR/RXR nuclear protein and FXR mRNA level (Figs. 2 and 3) did not increase above control values. SHP and BSEP mRNAs increased 2.6-fold (p < 0.001) and 34% (p < 0.05), respectively (Figs. 5 and 6), but FTF nuclear protein and mRNA levels remained unchanged (Figs. 7 and8). The relationship between SHP and CYP7A1 mRNA expression is described by the curve shown in Fig. 9. The data plotted are from five groups of rabbits (three rabbits in each group) under different treatments, i.e. controls, rabbits after 7 days of bile fistula drainage where the bile acid pool was depleted, rabbits after the depleted bile acid pool was replaced with DCA or UCA for 24 h, and rabbits with intact bile acid enterohepatic circulation fed 0.5% CA for 7 days. Mathematical analysis showed that the relationship between SHP and CYP7A1 mRNA expression can be described satisfactorily by the equation CYP7A1 = 0.180 − 0.181 ln(SHP) (r 2 = 0.915, p < 0.0001) where CYP7A1 and SHP represent the relative units of mRNA abundance, respectively. The leading theories concerning the mechanism of FXR activation by bile acids and the role of activated FXR in feedback regulation of CYP7A1 were based on findings derived from in vitro studies in cultured cells. Therefore, it became necessary to investigate these mechanisms in an in vivo whole animal model. In this study, we attempted to clarify: 1) the critical role of the FXR-activating ligand (DCA) in the enterohepatic bile acid flux for FXR activation; 2) whether bile acids play any role in the regulation of FXR transcription aside from a ligand role; and 3) whether FXR is the dominant regulator for bile acid synthesis (CYP7A1) and the canalicular transporter (BSEP). This study demonstrated that in the in vivo bile acid-depleted rabbit model, replacing the enterohepatic flux with DCA effectively activated FXR and regulated its downstream target genes. As we reported previously (19Xu G. Pan L. Erickson S.K. Forman B.M. Shneider B.L. Ananthanarayanan M., Li, X. Shefer S. Balasubramanian N., Ma, L. Asaoka H. Lear S.R. Nguyen L.B. Dussault I. Suchy F.J. Tint G.S. Salen G. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 45-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), when the endogenous bile acid pool consisting of 85% DCA was totally removed by bile fistula drainage for 7 days, CYP7A1 mRNA and activity levels increased significantly, because FXR transcriptional activity was muted as indicated by the decreased expression of FXR target genes. Importantly, the present work shows that after restoration of the enterohepatic bile acid pool/flux with DCA, FXR target gene expression also was restored as indicated by the increase in the expression of SHP and BSEPmRNAs and the decrease in CYP7A1 mRNA and activity relative to rabbits with depleted bile acid pools. When the enterohepatic bile acid pool/flux, which contained 88% DCA, was increased 2-fold by feeding 0.5% CA to rabbits with an intact enterohepatic circulation, CYP7A1 mRNA and activity values were significantly lower than the control values because FXR was activated as indicated by the increased mRNA levels of SHP and BSEP as compared with controls. Thus, these results consistently demonstrated that DCA was an effective FXR agonist in vivo. The inverse relationship between SHP and CYP7A1 mRNA expression is shown by the curve in Fig. 9 and described by the equation CYP7A1 = 0.180 − 0.181 ln(SHP). The data in this figure were plotted from five groups of rabbits with different treatments (controls, bile fistula drainage, DCA and UCA replacement, and CA feeding). The expression levels of SHP and CYP7A1 in the curve shown in Fig. 9represent a significant inverse relationship (r 2= 0.915, p < 0.0001). Mathematical analysis suggests that the effect of SHP on CYP7A1 is independent and saturable. When SHP expression is low (limited supply of activating ligand for FXR), CYP7A1 is elevated and sensitive to the increase in SHP expression, although when SHP expression rises beyond certain high levels, the increase in SHP mRNA does not result in further significant repression of CYP7A1. Although recent studies in Shp knock-out mice (10Kerr T.A. Saeku S. Schneider M. Schaefer K. Berdy S. Redder T. Shan B. Russell D.W. Schwartz M. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 713-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar,11Wang L. Lee Y.-K. Bundman D. Han Y. Thevananther S. Kim C.-S. Chua S.S. Wel P. Heyman R.A. Karin M. Moore D.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) demonstrated that other pathways were involved in the down-regulation of CYP7A1, these studies strongly indicated that activated FXR repressed CYP7A1 via SHP. The results of this study in the rabbit model support the hypothesis that activation of FXR induces SHP expression that down-regulates CYP7A1 transcription. However, when the depleted bile acid pool was restored with UCA, there was little effect on CYP7A1 mRNA and activity or FXR activation as indicated by the lack of effect on the SHP mRNA level. However, after UCA replacement, the FXR nuclear protein was restored to baseline levels, although downstream FXR-dependent transcriptional activity apparently was not. This mirrors the in vitrostudies on the high affinity ligands for FXR (1Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar), which show that hydrophilic, ursodeoxycholic acid is not an activating ligand of FXR. This study further demonstrated that the activation of FXR and its target genes was not solely dependent on changes in the size of the bile acid pool and enterohepatic flux per se. Infusing UCA restored the enterohepatic bile acid pool/flux but did not activate FXR, because the composition of the bile acid flux/pool was changed to 82% UCA with only 17% CA and 0.6% DCA. The amounts of CA and/or DCA were apparently below the ligand-activating threshold for FXR. Therefore, the composition of the circulating bile acid pool plays a critical role in determining the nuclear activation state of FXR. In other words, a sufficient enterohepatic circulating flux of activating/high affinity ligands is required for the activation of FXR and its subsequent effects on bile acid metabolism. Previously, we noted that in cholesterol fed rabbits the expanded bile acid pool was the determining factor for the regulation of CYP7A1 (12Xu G. Salen G. Shefer S. Tint G.S. Nguyen L.B. Chen T.S. Greenblatt D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Now we better understand that in cholesterol fed rabbits, >85% of the expanded bile acid pool was the FXR high affinity activating ligand, DCA. Not only did the bile acid pool double in size with cholesterol feeding, but the availability of a high affinity ligand supply of DCA also increased, resulting in the activation of FXR with the subsequent down-regulation of CYP7A1. It is interesting to note that in rabbits with depleted bile acid pool, a 24-h infusion of glyco-DCA at the same hepatic bile acid flux as controls did not completely restore SHP mRNA to the baseline levels seen in the controls. These results indicate that factors other than bile acid pool composition and hepatic flux might also affect the expression of SHP, and these non-bile acid factors might also be induced by bile fistula drainage. An important new observation in this study is that bile acids also regulate FXR mRNA levels. After the enterohepatic bile acid pool was removed, FXR mRNA and nuclear protein levels decreased significantly. When the depleted bile acid flux was restored with either DCA or UCA, the FXR mRNA and nuclear protein levels recovered to baseline values in controls without bile fistula. This suggests that bile acids, including those that are not activating/high affinity ligands of FXR, are necessary for maintenance of FXR mRNA and nuclear protein levels. As was observed in CA fed mice (20Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar), FXR mRNA levels were not increased. This suggests that increasing the bile acid pool beyond normal control levels has no effect on FXR mRNA. However, the bile fistula/bile acid replacement experiments described here demonstrate that a minimum level of bile acids in the enterohepatic circulation is required for the maintenance of FXR mRNA and nuclear protein levels at baseline values in the intact controls. The mechanisms of this regulation are still unknown. In this study, we did not find significant changes in FTF protein and mRNA levels in rabbits after removal of the bile acid pool where FXR was deactivated and CYP7A1 was up-regulated or in CA fed rabbits where the bile acid pool doubled, FXR was activated, and CYP7A1 was down-regulated. Therefore, changes in the activation of FXR or the regulation of CYP7A1 are not necessarily reflected by changes in the FTF protein or mRNA in the in vivo rabbit model. Although in vitro studies (1Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar, 2Makishima M.

Science. 1999; 284: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar) showed that the most effective ligands for FXR are hydrophobic bile acids such as DCA, CDCA, and LA, whereas hydrophilic bile acids, such as ursodeoxycholic acid and muricholic acids are not effective ligands for FXR, the mechanism of how bile acids activate FXR is not totally understood. However, we should point out that hydrophobicity is not the sole criterion for determining whether a bile acid is an activating ligand for FXR, because hydrophobicity refers to the water insolubility of the bile acid. For example, to infuse DCA dissolved in a water solution into the duodenum, the hydrophobic DCA was conjugated with the amino acid glycine, making it hydrophilic; but replacing the bile acid pool with hydrophilic glyco-DCA also activated FXR. Measurements of FXR activity in this study were important for understanding the effect of bile acids on the function of FXR in the regulation of CYP7A1. Presently, there is no method available for the direct measurement of FXR activation in vivo. In our studies, we measured the changes in the expression of target genes of FXR as markers for the activation of FXR. SHP mRNA levels always mirrored the changes in FXR activation. However, although BSEP mRNA levels were regulated by activated FXR, other bile acid-dependent mechanisms also appear to be involved. UCA did not activate FXR but did produce similar quantitative biliary bile acid outputs such as DCA with a 48% increase of BSEP mRNA. This suggested that in addition to FXR, BSEP might also be regulated by the bile acid flux in an FXR-independent manner. In summary, this study demonstrated in the rabbit model that DCA is a potent ligand for FXR, activated FXR mediates negative regulation of CYP7A1, and bile acids are required to maintain FXR mRNA and nuclear FXR protein levels. Non-activating ligand bile acids can induce FXR mRNA and protein, but the FXR protein is not activated and cannot down-regulate CYP7A1. Therefore, activation of FXR is not solely dependent on the size of the bile acid pool but, as importantly, on the proportion of activating ligands of FXR in the circulating bile acid pool/flux mixture."

GTPase-activating protein guanine nucleotide exchange factor Dbl homology pleckstrin homology wild type response units glutathioneS-transferase p21 binding domain N-methylanthraniloyl. Similar to other members of the Ras superfamily, Rho family GTPases are biologically active when bound to GTP and are deactivated upon hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, a reaction typically accelerated by Rho GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs).1 Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) rapidly convert GTPases to their biologically active states by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP. Currently, Dbl (diffuse B-cell lymphoma) family members constitute the largest group of GEFs for Rho GTPases (1Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Isolated DH domains typically possess significant exchange potential that can be enhanced by the adjacent PH domain (4Liu X. Wang H. Eberstadt M. Schnuchel A. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P.

The invariant linkage of DH and PH domains hints at a conserved function that is currently poorly understood. As proposed for other GEFs, the reaction scheme for Dbl-stimulated exchange includes the formation of a low affinity GEF·GTPase·GDP·Mg2+ quaternary complex that rapidly converts to a high affinity GEF·GTPase binary complex concomitant with expulsion of GDP and Mg2+ (6Cherfils J. Chardin P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 306-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The reaction proceeds with the binding of GTP·Mg2+ to form an unstable quaternary complex of GEF·GTPase·GTP·Mg2+, followed by dissociation of the GEF from the GTP-bound GTPase. We have recently determined crystal structures of several unique DH/PH fragments in complex with their cognate Rho family GTPases (5Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P.

Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and the structures indicate a conserved mechanism of exchange. For example, Rho GTPases possess two “switch” regions that are conformationally sensitive to the state of bound nucleotide, and these switch regions occupy similar conformations in all current structures of Rho GTPases bound to GEFs. Certain conformational features of DH domain-bound Rho GTPases are also present in other GEF·GTPase structures, such as Sos1 (Cdc25 domain)·Ras (9Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), RCC1·Ran (10Renault L. Kuhlmann J. Henkel A. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 2001; 105: 245-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and SopE·Cdc42 (11Buchwald G. Friebel A. Galan J.E. Hardt W.D. Wittinghofer A. Scheffzek K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and are indicative of conserved aspects of the catalyzed exchange mechanism utilized by various GEF families. In order to more thoroughly understand the relative contributions of key structural features in facilitating guanine nucleotide exchange by RhoGEFs, Cdc42 and the Dbl family member Dbs (for Dbl'sbig sister) were mutated at critical sites, and the functional consequences were determined. This analysis indicates that mutations that affect Mg2+ binding are critical for efficient GEF-catalyzed exchange. Specifically, the methyl group of Ala59 within Cdc42 or its equivalent in Rac1 and RhoA normally impinges upon the Mg2+ binding site within the GEF·GTPase complexes. Consequently, substitution of alanine 59 to glycine in Cdc42 severely cripples GEF binding and exchange. Similarly, interactions that support the steric overlap of Ala59 and the Mg2+-binding site also appear critical for nucleotide exchange. Mutations that affect interactions with the sugar or base of guanine nucleotides also have significant effects on exchange, but these effects are secondary to disruption of Mg2+ binding. One mutation (C18A) in Cdc42, designed to disrupt a hydrogen bond with the α-phosphate of guanine nucleotides, is particularly notable, since it confers a dominant negative phenotype upon Cdc42. Cdc42(C18A) is impaired in nucleotide binding and consequently binds Dbs with higher affinity than wild-type Cdc42. In vivo, Cdc42(C18A) exhibits a dominant-negative phenotype, presumably by sequestering exchange factors in nucleotide-depleted complexes analogous to other, better characterized variants of Rho GTPases (i.e.Cdc42(T17N)). A carboxyl-terminal His6-tagged, wild type DH/PH fragment (residues 623–967) expression construct was derived from a cDNA library of mouse brain as described previously (5Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into wild type Dbs DH/PH domain and Cdc42 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as per the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA sequences of all protein expression constructs were verified by automated sequencing. Dbs and Cdc42 proteins were expressed and purified as described (5Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis of N-methylanthraniloyl (mant)-GTP incorporation into bacterially purified Cdc42 and RhoA was carried out using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B spectrometer at 25 °C. Exchange assays containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm mant-GTP (Biomol) and a 1 or 2 μm concentration (as indicated) of either Cdc42 or RhoA protein, were prepared and allowed to equilibrate with continuous stirring. After equilibration, Dbs DH/PH domain was added to 200 nm, and the rates of GTP loading (k obs) for wild type and mutant Cdc42 proteins were determined by monitoring the decrease in tryptophan fluorescence (λex = 295 nm, λem = 335 nm) in response to binding mant-GTP (12Leonard D.A. Evans T. Hart M. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12323-12328Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Klebe C. Nishimoto T. Wittinghofer F.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Because of their high intrinsic exchange rate, Cdc42(C18A) and Cdc42(V33A) were added to equilibrated exchange reactions containing 200 nm Dbs. To test the inhibition of Dbs-catalyzed exchange by Cdc42(C18A), 400 nm Cdc42(WT) preloaded with mant-GDP was stimulated by 200 nm Dbs DH/PH in the presence of 2 μmCdc42(WT) or Cdc42(C18A), each bound to GDP. Reaction conditions were similar to those described above except that 20 μm GDP was used in place of 100 μm GTP and exchange was followed by measuring the decrease in fluorescence resulting from mant-GDP release from Cdc42 (λex = 360 nm, λem = 440 nm). The rates (k obs) of guanine nucleotide exchange were determined by fitting the data as single exponential decays utilizing GraphPad Prizm software. Data were normalized to wild type curves to yield the percentage of GDP released. All experiments were performed at least in duplicate. Cdc42 binding to Dbs was monitored using surface plasmon resonance with a BIAcore 2000 instrument at 25 °C. His-tagged Dbs DH/PH domain was immobilized to a nickel surface on a nitrilotriacetic acid sensor chip (BIAcore) as described by the manufacturer. Cdc42 solutions (ranging in concentration from 156 nm to 2.5 μm) were injected over the stable Dbs surface with or without 50 μm EDTA (used to chelate Mg2+ and remove nucleotide) at 25 μl/min for 25 s and allowed to dissociate for 60 s in phosphate-buffered saline. Raw data were normalized to the signal achieved due to binding a surface lacking Dbs. Normalized sensorgrams were aligned, and the steady state binding signal from each curve was fit to a single binding isotherm. The resulting dissociation constants are the mean of several sets of analyte concentrations.

As we have previously described (7Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), the repositioning of Cys18, Val33, Ala59, and Glu62 (Cdc42 numbering) within the complexes appears essential for efficient guanine nucleotide exchange (Fig. 1). In order to better understand the contribution of these four residues to the exchange reaction, we have assessed the mechanistic effects of substitutions at these positions within Cdc42 using a combination of fluorescence spectroscopy to measure guanine nucleotide exchange rates and surface plasmon resonance to measure affinities of complex formation. Cys18 and Val33 apparently undergo a concerted rearrangement within the nucleotide binding pocket upon complex formation, resulting in reorientation of the cysteine side chain relative to the nucleotide-bound structures of Rho GTPases. In this new rotamer conformation, Cys18 can no longer hydrogen-bond to a nucleotide α-phosphate (Fig. 1 B), and loss of this hydrogen bond should reduce the affinity for nucleotide and promote exchange in the absence of GEF. Consequently, and as expected, substitution of Cys18 to alanine increases the spontaneous loading of mant-GTP onto Cdc42 (∼0.0044/s versus 0.0003/s for Cdc42(WT)), partially mimicking the action of Dbs (Fig. 2 A, TableI). The further stimulation of Cdc42(C18A) by Dbs (∼0.0461/s) undoubtedly arises from GEF-induced alterations to portions of the active site outside the phosphate-binding loop.Table IRate and binding constants for Dbs-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange of wild type and mutant Cdc42 proteins2 μm Cdc42Intrinsic rate (k obs)Rate with 0.2 μm Dbs (k obs)StimulationK d (+EDTA)K d (−EDTA)s −1 × 10 −3-foldnmnmWT0.26 ± 0.0118.74 ± 1.4672 ± 5425NBC18A4.44 ± 0.0846.07 ± 1.8010 ± 0178457V33A1.49 ± 0.0415.52 ± 0.1810 ± 0714NBA59G0.19 ± 0.010.79 ± 0.044 ± 0NBNBE62A0.18 ± 0.000.18 ± 0.021 ± 0NBNBRates (k obs) of guanine nucleotide exchange for the various Cdc42 proteins were determined by fitting the data from Fig. 2to a single exponential decay function. -Fold stimulation is the corresponding ratio of rates for the Dbs-catalyzed versusintrinsic exchange reactions. k obs values are the mean of at least two experiments with S.D. values.K d values are estimated from the SPR data in Fig. 2.

Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the side chains of residues analogous to Val33 within Cdc42 are moved into the site normally occupied by Cys18, promoting an alternate rotamer conformation of the cysteine residue that can no longer hydrogen-bond to the α-phosphate of guanine nucleotides (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, substitution of Val33 to alanine within Cdc42 was designed to decouple structural alterations propagating from switch 1 to Cys18 within the phosphate binding loop. Since the rearrangement of Cys18 is predicted to be critically important to the GEF-catalyzed exchange reaction, mutation of Val33 was anticipated to hinder Dbs-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange. Experimentally, Cdc42(V33A) bound to Dbs with an affinity similar to Cdc42(WT) (Fig. 2, G andJ, Table I). In addition, the Dbs-catalyzed rate of mant-GTP loading was only mildly impaired on Cdc42(V33A) (Fig. 2 B, Table I). However, this observation is complicated by an ∼5-fold increase in the intrinsic exchange rate within Cdc42(V33A)versus wild type (∼0.0015/s versus ∼0.0003/s, respectively), reducing the overall efficiency of Dbs-catalyzed exchange on Cdc42(V33A) (10-fold versus 72-fold stimulation for wild type) (Table I). These results are most easily explained by postulating that Val33 is needed not only to transmit structural alterations within switch 1 to Cys18 but also to maintain the overall integrity of the nucleotide binding pocket irrespective of Dbs engagement. Within conserved region 1 of the Dbs DH domain, the side chain of Glu639 is clearly critical for stabilizing switch 1 (Fig. 1 B) and hydrogen-bonds with the hydroxyl of Tyr32 and the backbone nitrogens of Thr35 and Val36. The equivalent of Glu639 is highly conserved among DH domains. Consistent with the necessity for Dbs to rearrange switch 1 of Cdc42 to effect exchange, mutation of the conserved glutamate (E639A) decreases the rates of Dbs-catalyzed exchange upon Cdc42 and RhoA 29- and 21-fold from wild-type rates, respectively (Fig. 3 and TableII). Residues analogous to Glu639 have been previously assessed for their role in nucleotide exchange for other Dbl family members (4Liu X. Wang H. Eberstadt M. Schnuchel A. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P.

The -fold stimulation for each Dbs protein reflects the ratio of k obs measured for the GEF-containing reaction to the unstimulated reaction containing no GEF (none). Ala59 of Cdc42 is repositioned upon complex formation with Dbs to occlude the Mg2+ binding site (Fig. 1 C). Glu62 of Cdc42 supports this rearrangement as well as helping to preserve the integrity of the P-loop through interaction with Lys16. Repositioning Ala59(Ala59 in Rac1, Ala61 in RhoA) and Glu62 (Glu62 in Rac1, Glu64 in RhoA) occurs identically in the structures of Tiam1·Rac1, Dbs·Cdc42, and Dbs·RhoA, arguing for the importance of these altered conformations during nucleotide exchange of Rho GTPases. Consistent with this structural information, both the A59G and E62A mutations in Cdc42 are extremely deleterious to guanine nucleotide exchange (Fig. 2, C and D). Both Cdc42(A59G) and Cdc42(E62A) are essentially unresponsive to Dbs, and despite the fact that Glu62 undergoes no change in solvent exposure and the Ala59 methyl carbon loses only ∼10 Å2 upon complex formation, neither mutant displays measurable binding to Dbs as indicated by surface plasmon resonance (Table I). Furthermore, it is interesting to note that both A59G and E62A decrease the intrinsic rates of exchange for Cdc42, arguing that disruption of Mg2+ binding is important for spontaneous exchange within the GTPase. When a mutation in a GTPase decreases affinity for bound nucleotide, the GTPase may behave as a so-called “dominant negative” in the presence of its exchange factor, displaying increased affinity toward the GEF because it is less easily displaced through nucleotide binding. Accordingly, Cdc42(C18A) binds with increased affinity to Dbs both in the presence and absence of nucleotide (Fig. 2, F and I; Table I). Consistent with this behavior, Cdc42(C18A) effectively inhibits Dbs-catalyzed exchange of wild-type Cdc42 in vitro (Fig. 4). Similarly, Cdc42(C18A) inhibits the ability of Dbl, a close homologue of Dbs, to elicit transcription by NF-κB normally associated with Cdc42 activation in vivo(Fig. 5). Transcriptional inhibition by Cdc42(C18A) and the classical dominant-negative Cdc42(T17N) are roughly equal, indicating that Cdc42(C18A) is a potent dominant negative of Cdc42 activity.Figure 5The Cdc42(C18A) mutant functions as a dominant inhibitor. A, Dbl-HA1 activates Cdc42 in COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 3 μg of pAX142 (− GEF) or pAX142-Dbl-HA1 (+ GEF), along with 3 μg of Cdc42(WT). Lysates were collected at 48 h and examined by Western blots for overall expression of Cdc42 and Dbl-HA1 as indicated as well as activated Cdc42 (GTP-bound) isolated by affinity purification with GST-PBD. B, Cdc42(C18A) blocks activation of an NF-κB-responsive transcriptional reporter by Dbl-HA1. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with 3 μg of pAX142 (vector), pAX142-Cdc42(WT), pAX142-Cdc42(17N), or pAX142-Cdc42(C18A), along with 3 μg of pAX142-Dbl(HA1), 2.5 μg of NF-κB-luc, and 500 ng of pCMVnlac as an internal control for transfection efficiency and/or growth inhibition. Luciferase and β-galactosidase levels were measured and expressed as -fold activation relative to the level of activation seen with empty vector control.

Instead, RhoGEFs manipulate GTPase residues to promote ejection of GDP and Mg2+. The molecular rearrangements originally seen in Rac1 bound to Tiam1 (7Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and recapitulated in the structures of Dbs·Cdc42 (5Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), Dbs·RhoA, and intersectin·Cdc42 (8Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) strongly support the assumption of a conserved exchange mechanism for all Dbl family proteins. Specifically, repositioning of switch 1 of Cdc42 moves Phe28 away from the nucleotide base, displaces Thr35 so that it no longer interacts favorably with the Mg2+ ion, and, via Val33, alters the side chain conformer of Cys18 so that it can no longer hydrogen-bond with the α-phosphate of GDP (Fig. 1 B). The importance of Phe28 was highlighted in a previous study (23Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), where substitution of this residue to leucine in Cdc42 results in a “fast cycling” mutant with spontaneous exchange on par with Dbl-catalyzed exchange. Less well appreciated is the role of Cys18 of Cdc42 in binding nucleotides. However, the results presented here clearly demonstrate a critical role for Cys18 of Cdc42 in binding nucleotides and participating in a conserved exchange reaction catalyzed by RhoGEFs. With the exception of the three Rnd proteins (Rho6/Rnd1, Rho7/Rnd2, and Rho8/RhoE/Rnd3) that feature an alanine at position 18, all other Rho family members possess either a cysteine or the isosteric serine at this position. When Cys18 is substituted to alanine, Cdc42 loses the ability to bind nucleotide with high affinity, resulting in rapid exchange. Similarly, alanine at this position in the Rnd proteins may underlie their relatively high rates of spontaneous nucleotide exchange (24Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Like the Rnd proteins, Ras possesses an alanine at position 18 that cannot hydrogen-bond to the nucleotide α-phosphate. However, Ras, rather than binding weakly to nucleotides like the Rnd proteins, possesses other subtle differences in its active site and binds nucleotides with higher affinity than the Rho proteins (25Ihara K. Muraguchi S. Kato M. Shimizu T. Shirakawa M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9656-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 26Zhang B. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25299-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Powers et al. (27Powers S. O'Neill K. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have shown that the A25P mutation in yeast RAS (equivalent to A18P in human H-Ras) conferred a dominant-interfering phenotype. Examination of the nucleotide-bound H-Ras crystal structure (protein data bank code 121P) reveals that A18P would disrupt protein-nucleotide interactions primarily by introducing steric conflict with a bound nucleotide, unlike C18A in Cdc42, which introduces a smaller side chain and directly abolishes a positive protein-nucleotide interaction. Furthermore, like Cdc42(C18A), Ras(D119N) has decreased affinity for nucleotides, resulting in increased affinity of Ras for its exchange factor, Sos1 (son of sevenless) (23Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 28Cool R.H. Schmidt G. Lenzen C.U. Prinz H. Vogt D. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6297-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), with associated pleiotropic effects in vivo. For instance, at low expression levels, Ras(D119N) produces a dominant negative phenotype presumably by sequestering Sos1. However, at expression levels much higher than endogenous GEFs, Ras(D119N) is largely unbound by GEFs and overly active, since the mutation does not compromise effector binding and GTP is rapidly loading. Cdc42(C18A) may behave similarly, and more extensive analyses are necessary to fully understand the consequences of Cdc42(C18A) expression in vivo. Finally, a naturally occurring mutation within Ras, A18T, occurs at the analogous position to Cys18 in Cdc42 and is associated with excellent prognosis for patients with malignant melanoma (29Demunter A. Ahmadian M.R. Libbrecht L. Stas M. Baens M. Scheffzek K. Degreef H., De Wolf-Peeters C. van Den Oord J.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4916-4922PubMed Google Scholar). Like Cdc42(C18A), Ras(A18T) also increases spontaneous nucleotide exchange rates, and we suggest that Ras(A18T) may inhibit Ras functions and associated tumor progression by sequestering GEFs. The importance of stabilizing the conserved conformational alterations of switch 1 by RhoGEFs is further emphasized by the role of Glu639 of Dbs (Fig. 1 B). This residue makes three conserved hydrogen bonds to switch 1 of Cdc42 that are crucial for reconfiguring switch 1 to promote nucleotide ejection. Not surprisingly, when Glu639 is substituted with alanine (E639A), Dbs only weakly catalyzes the exchange of nucleotides within Cdc42 or RhoA. Dbl family proteins stabilize nearly identical conformations of switch 2 in Rho GTPases, and these conformations are similarly recapitulated in the structures of Ras (Fig. 1 D) or Ran in complex with their exchange factors (9Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 10Renault L. Kuhlmann J. Henkel A. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 2001; 105: 245-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) as well as the structure of RhoA bound to GDP but without magnesium (Fig. 1 E) (30Shimizu T. Ihara K. Maesaki R. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18311-18317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This latter structure is particularly intriguing, since it may represent a stable intermediate along the reaction coordinate for exchange that is subsequently bound by GEFs (30Shimizu T. Ihara K. Maesaki R. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18311-18317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In light of this idea, the failure of Cdc42(E62A) to bind Dbs might be explained best as a recognition problem; i.e. Cdc42(E62A) is either never adopting the correct conformation of switch 2 conducive to Dbs-catalyzed exchange, or the sampling of this conformation is too short lived for productive engagement of Dbs. In favor of the idea that certain dynamic states of the switch regions promote binding in native GTPases, Spoerner et al. (31Spoerner M. Herrmann C. Vetter I.R. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4944-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) have shown that mutation of Thr35 to serine in Ras dramatically alters the dynamic equilibrium of the effector loop to favor conformations incompetent for effector binding. Although the side chain of Ala59 of Cdc42 does make minimal contact with Dbs, similar to the other RhoGEF·GTPase structures, the primary interaction is through its carbonyl oxygen, which interacts with a conserved positively charged side chain within the DH domain (Lys774 in Dbs; Lys1195 in Tiam1; Arg1384 via a water molecule in intersectin) (Fig. 1 C). In theory, this interaction should be preserved in the A59G mutation. Nevertheless, Cdc42(A59G) has a greatly reduced affinity for Dbs under the surface plasmon resonance assay conditions. This reduction in binding may arise from the introduction of conformational freedom within switch 2, (similar to that postulated for Cdc42(E62A)), or the Ala59 side chain may be instrumental in the transient removal of Mg2+ in the absence of GEF. Since both the A59G and E62A substitutions significantly reduced the intrinsic rate of exchange of Cdc42, this latter explanation is an attractive possibility for either mutant. Generally, mutations similar to E62A of Cdc42 in other GTPases (Ran(E70A), Ras(E62H)) also severely impair GEF-catalyzed nucleotide exchange (10Renault L. Kuhlmann J. Henkel A. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 2001; 105: 245-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 32Mistou M.Y. Jacquet E. Poullet P. Rensland H. Gideon P. Schlichting I. Wittinghofer A. Parmeggiani A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), suggesting that identical aspects of GEF-catalyzed exchange are conserved among different GTPase families. However, on a cautionary note, Ala59 of Ras bound to Sos (9Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) occupies the same position as Ala59 of Cdc42 bound to Dbs (Fig. 1,C and D), yet A59G in Ras has no effect on the rate of GDP release catalyzed by Sos (33Hall B.E. Yang S.S. Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Kuriyan J. Bar-Sagi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27629-27637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, the GEF-catalyzed exchange reactions for Ras and Rho GTPases do not appear identical despite significant structural similarities. Recently, the structure of the bacterial RhoGEF, SopE, has been determined in complex with nucleotide- and Mg2+-free Cdc42 (11Buchwald G. Friebel A. Galan J.E. Hardt W.D. Wittinghofer A. Scheffzek K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although SopE is specific for Cdc42 and Rac1 (34Friebel A. Ilchmann H. Aepfelbacher M. Ehrbar K. Machleidt W. Hardt W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34035-34040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the overall architecture of SopE is unrelated to DH domains. However, superpositioning of SopE-bound Cdc42 with Dbs-bound Cdc42 reveals that switches 1 and 2 of the GTPase are in nearly identical conformations when complexed to either GEF. In addition, key GEF/GTPase interactions with the switch regions have been preserved, with SopE featuring Asp124 stabilizing switch 1 (equivalent to Glu639 in Dbs) and Gln109 (equivalent to Asn810 in Dbs) involved in binding switch 2 (5Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11Buchwald G. Friebel A. Galan J.E. Hardt W.D. Wittinghofer A. Scheffzek K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Within SopE·Cdc42, Cys18, Val33, Ala59, and Glu62 are reoriented to nearly identical positions relative to Dbs·Cdc42, and these residues are presumably similarly involved in nucleotide exchange. Overall, these structural similarities suggest that SopE catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange of Rho GTPases similar to Dbl family proteins. We are grateful to M. Pham and S. Gershburg for technical assistance and N. Nassar for providing unpublished coordinates of Cdc42·GDP·Mg2+."

We found that these extracts are able to support the removal of 5,6-dihydrouracil from DNA at about 20% of the efficiency of normal extracts. Furthermore, we also found that single-nucleotide patch base excision repair is the major pathway for removal of 5,6-dihydrouracil in mNTH1-deficient cell extracts, suggesting the involvement of other DNA glycosylase(s) in the removal of oxidized pyrimidines."

In this study we have investigated the fate of the Rad17/RF-C complex after treatment of synchronized Hela cells with the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea. In hydroxyurea treated cells the RF-C p37 subunit became more resistant to extraction. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation studies with extracts of hydroxyurea treated cells showed an interaction of RF-C p37 with Rad17 and of PCNA with Rad9 and RF-C p37. An enhanced colocalization of Rad17 and PCNA in late S phase after hydroxyurea treatment was observed. Our data suggested, that upon replication block a Rad17/RF-C complex is recruited to sites of DNA lesions in late S phase, binds the Rad9/Hus1/Rad1 complex and enables it to interact with PCNA. An interaction of Rad17/RF-C with PCNA appears to be mediated by the small RF-C p37 subunit, suggesting that PCNA might provide communication between replication checkpoint control and DNA replication and repair."
