https://openalex.org/W1559264985,"Attempts to fabricate mechanical devices on the molecular level have yielded analogues of rotors, gears, switches, shuttles, turnstiles and ratchets. Molecular motors, however, have not yet been made, even though they are common in biological systems. Rotary motion as such has been induced in interlocked systems and directly visualized for single molecules, but the controlled conversion of energy into unidirectional rotary motion has remained difficult to achieve. Here we report repetitive, monodirectional rotation around a central carbon-carbon double bond in a chiral, helical alkene, with each 360 degrees rotation involving four discrete isomerization steps activated by ultraviolet light or a change in the temperature of the system. We find that axial chirality and the presence of two chiral centres are essential for the observed monodirectional behaviour of the molecular motor. Two light-induced cis-trans isomerizations are each associated with a 180 degrees rotation around the carbon-carbon double bond and are each followed by thermally controlled helicity inversions, which effectively block reverse rotation and thus ensure that the four individual steps add up to one full rotation in one direction only. As the energy barriers of the helicity inversion steps can be adjusted by structural modifications, chiral alkenes based on our system may find use as basic components for 'molecular machinery' driven by light."

Recently, activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) has been shown to be under oxidoreduction (redox) regulation controlled by thioredoxin (TRX), which is one of major endogenous redox-regulating molecules with thiol reducing activity. In order to elucidate where in the cellular compartment TRX participates in NF-κB regulation, we investigated the intracellular localization of TRX. UVB irradiation induced translocation of TRX from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. In our in vitro diamide-induced cross-linking study, we showed that TRX can associate directly with NF-κB p50. Overexpression of wild-type TRX suppressed induction of luciferase activity under NF-κB-binding sites in response to UV irradiation compared with the mock transfectant. In contrast, overexpression of nuclear-targeted TRX enhanced the luciferase activity. Thus, TRX seems to play dual and opposing roles in the regulation of NF-κB. In the cytoplasm, it interferes with the signals to IκB kinases and blocks the degradation of IκB. In the nucleus, however, TRX enhances NF-κB transcriptional activities by enhancing its ability to bind DNA. This two-step TRX-dependent regulation of the NF-κB complex may be a novel activation mechanism of redox-sensitive transcription factors.

TRX is a small, ubiquitous protein with two redox-active half-cysteine residues in its catalytic active center, having the consensus amino acid sequence -Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys- (9Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein exists either in a reduced form with a dithiol or in an oxidized form, in which the half-cystine residues form an intramolecular disulfide bridge. TRX participates in redox reactions by reversible oxidation of its active center dithiol to a disulfide and catalyzes dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions (10Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) involving many thiol-dependent cellular processes, including gene expression and signal transduction. Human TRX was originally cloned as a soluble factor named adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor, which was purified from the conditioned medium of human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-I-transformed CD4+ T-cell line, ATL-2 (11Yodoi J.

In the case of NF-κB, however, there seems to be some controversy on the redox regulation of its activation. NF-κB is stored as an inactive cytoplasmic complex in association with IκB. When activation signals reach the IκB kinase complex (22Régnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M.

It is suggested that reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs), which are generated in the cells, act as second messenger molecules as follows: cytokines such as TNFα binding its specific receptor causes oxidative stress or an increase in the ROI concentration in cells (1Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with radical scavengers, such asN-acetyl-l-cysteine and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, as well as transient overexpression of TRX inhibited nuclear translocation and transactivation of NF-κB (20Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 29Schreck R. Albermann K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). Once translocated into the intranuclear compartment, however, the redox environment seems to be quite important for NF-κB activity. DNA binding activity of NF-κB is shown to be under redox regulation through the modulation of cysteines (5Okamoto T. Ogiwara H. Hayashi T. Mitsui A. Kawabe T. Yodoi J. Int.

This inhibition was reversed by treatment with reducing agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, and recombinant human TRX (5Okamoto T. Ogiwara H. Hayashi T. Mitsui A. Kawabe T. Yodoi J. Int. Immunol. 1992; 4: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 38Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T.

Moreover, there is a report that transient overexpression of human TRX in COS1 and Jurkat T-cell augments gene expression from human immunodeficiency virus, type I-long terminal repeat (39Hayashi T. Ueno Y. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11380-11388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TRX, thus, is suggested to be a candidate for the endogenous molecules that play in redox regulation of gene expression of transcription factor NF-κB. The main aim of this paper is to clarify where and how TRX regulates a transcription factor, NF-κB complex, which translocates from cytosol to nucleus, and to elucidate a dynamic role of TRX on redox regulation of transcription in cells. For this purpose, we investigated the subcellular localization of TRX after stimulations including UVB irradiation and TNFα treatment and a possibility of direct association between NF-κB and TRX in the nucleus. Our data indicate that TRX translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and translocated TRX potentiates NF-κB-dependent transcription. Moreover, direct association between TRX and NF-κB in the nucleus was suggested byin vitro cross-linking assay. Transformed human keratinocytes, established from human squamous cell carcinoma of skin, HSC-1, were a gift from Dr. Y. Kondo (40Kondo Y. Aso K. Br. J. Dermatol. 1981; 105: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). HSC-1, NIH3T3, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 95% humidity in 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Human tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) was from Life Technologies, Inc. Anti-human TRX monoclonal antibodies, 11-mAb and 21-mAb (41Sasada T. Iwata S. Sato N. Kitaoka Y. Hirota K. Nakamura K. Nishiyama A. Taniguchi Y. Takabayashi A. Yodoi J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2268-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), were established and provided by FujiRebio, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Anti-NF-κB p50 (NL5), anti-NF-κB p65 (A), and anti-IκBα (C21) polyclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cells were plated on chamber slides (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL). The culture media were replaced with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cells were exposed to an UVB source (UVP Inc., Upland, CA). After exposure, cells were incubated with culture media at 37 °C. Mutagenesis of human TRX was performed by a polymerase chain reaction-based technique (8Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) and subcloned intoBamHI-SalI-cut pBluescript II SK+ plasmid (pBSII-TRX). Expression vectors for TRX, pcDNA3-TRX-wt and pcDNA3-TRX-dm, were made by insertingBamHI-XhoI fragment from pBSII-TRX plasmids intoBamHI-XhoI-cut pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA). An expression vector, pCMX-GAL4-TRX-wt, was described previously (8Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-anti-TRX was made by insertingBamHI-HindIII fragment from pcdSRαTRX plasmid (8Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar) into BamHI-HindIII-cut pcDNA3. The expression plasmids were introduced into the cells by the use of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), following the protocol previously described (8Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence cell staining was performed following the protocol previously described. Briefly, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum for 20 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization for 10 min using 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. After incubation with primary antibodies (for TRX, monoclonal 11-mAb; for NF-κB p50 or p65, polyclonal antibody) for 1 h at room temperature. The slides then were incubated for 1 h with a secondary antibody as follows: fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for TRX, or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) for NF-κB p50 or p65. Slides with stained cells were mounted in 90% glycerol with 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine and examined with a confocal microscope, MRC-1024 (Bio-Rad). Human TRX recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as the N-terminal fused form with hexahistidine (6xHis) tag using the pQE30 expression plasmids (Qiagen) essentially following the protocol described previously (8Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Truncated human NF-κB p50 DNA-binding domain (residues 35–381) was expressed based on the pQE-p50 as a 6xHis-tagged protein by use of the same protocol as that used for the expression of TRX. Crude nuclear cell extracts were prepared as described (42Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Each fraction was applied to a 15% SDS-PAGE and electrophoresed. After electroblotting, the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) was treated with 5% (w/v) skim milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) and incubated with antigen-specific antibodies against human TRX, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The epitope was visualized with an ECL Western blot detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The amount of TRX in each sample was estimated by analysis of the density of each band, using a computerized densitometer (PDI Analyzer; ToYoBo, Tokyo, Japan). In the cross-linking assay, 6xHis-TRXs (100 ng) and 6xHis-p50 (200 ng) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 mmdithiothreitol (8Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Then they were mixed and incubated in the presence of 10 mm diamide for 30 min at room temperature in 20 μl of PBS, pH 7.3. The reaction mixture was denatured for 5 min at 90 °C in dissociation buffer with or without 2-mercaptoethanol (1%). Each mixture was applied to a 15% SDS-PAGE and electrophoresed. Epitopes were detected by Western blot. To estimate the reducing activity of TRX, an insulin-reducing assay was performed according to a previous report (41Sasada T. Iwata S. Sato N. Kitaoka Y. Hirota K. Nakamura K. Nishiyama A. Taniguchi Y. Takabayashi A. Yodoi J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2268-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast TRX reductase was provided by Oriental Yeast Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and can reduce mammalian TRX. The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was recorded by use of a THERMOMAX microplate reader (Molecular Devices) to detect maximal NADPH consumption rate (V max, millioptical density at 340 nm/min). As a control, samples were incubated with the reaction mixture without insulin. Each value was calculated according to a method previously reported. The calculated values were compared with the standard curve for rTRX (100–1200 ng/ml) to obtain quantitative determinations of the absolute amounts of TRX. A phagemid vector pNF-κB-luciferase, which contains five copies of κB-binding motif of the murine immunoglobulin κ light chain enhancer, was purchased from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA. HeLa cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well. The expression plasmids were introduced into the cells using LipofectAMINE reagent. In each transfection, 1 μg of the pcDNA3-TRX-wt or pCMX-GAL4-TRX-wt expression plasmid, 1 μg of pNF-κB-Luc, and 1 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) as an internal control were used. Total amounts of DNA were adjusted to 3 μg with pcDNA3. After incubation at 16 h, cells were irradiated with 400 J/m2 of UVB and were kept for 12 h or incubated with recombinant human TNFα for 12 h. Then the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was determined using a commercial assay system (Promega) with a luminometer, Lumat LB9507 (Berthold, GmbH & Co. KG, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The relative fold induction of luciferase activity was calculated by normalizing to the β-galactosidase activity. As a step toward dissecting the roles of TRX in early stage of UV responses, we examined intracellular locations of TRX after UV exposure. Transformed human keratinocytes, HSC-1 cells, were stained using an immunofluorescence method with 11-mAb raised against human TRX. In control cells without UVB irradiation, TRX was stained mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A), whereas after 1 h exposure to 400 J/m2 UVB, most of the fluorescence translocated into the nucleus (Fig. 1 B). Under the same conditions, nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65/RelA was also observed (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast to the case of RelA subunit, NF-κB p50 was localized in the nucleus and remained there even after UVB irradiation (Fig. 1, E andF). The UV-induced translocation of TRX was observed also in HeLa cells (Fig. 1, G and H). Similar translocation patterns were detected by use of another monoclonal antibody, 21-mAb, which may recognize a different epitope on human TRX (data not shown). To quantify the subcellular TRX after UVB irradiation, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of HSC-1 cells were fractionated and analyzed by Western blot analysis. In agreement with the results of the immunofluorescence staining, the amount of TRX in the nuclear fraction extracted 1 h after UVB irradiation was increased by about 4-fold (Fig. 2). The total amount of intracellular TRX was unchanged 1 h after irradiation (data not shown). Next, we examined whether stimulation or treatment other than UV irradiation could translocate TRX into the nucleus. TNFα is one of pro-inflammatory cytokines and is known to be a potent NF-κB activator. It is reported that formation of ROIs is crucial in this process (43Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, TNFα treatment (100 ng/ml) resulted in the translocation of TRX from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in HeLa cells no later than 1 h after the treatment. As reported previously PMA also translocated TRX (8Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). As we and others (8Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To dissect further the detail of redox regulation of NF-κB, we examined direct association between TRX and NF-κB in in vitro systems. We reasoned that it would be possible to trap the transient physical association using cross-linking reagent(s) such as diamide, which converts free sulfhydryls to disulfides by cysteine oxidation (8Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 9Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine which of the five cysteines in TRX is responsible for intermolecular disulfide bond formation, TRX mutants, which contained cysteines-to-serines or cysteine-to-alanine substitution(s), were purified as the hexahistidine (6xHis)-tagged form. A series of experiments was performed with the 6xHis-tagged NF-κB p50 and mutants of TRX. It is known that TRX-(C62S/C69S/C73S) retains its reducing activity (46Oblong J.E. Berggren M. Gasdaska P.Y. Powis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11714-11720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type or mutant recombinant TRX proteins were incubated with recombinant NF-κB-p50 DNA-binding domain, and then their migration patterns were analyzed. Antibodies against NF-κB p50 (Fig. 4, 4th and8th lanes) and TRX (data not shown) recognized the same extra bands migrating around 50 kDa in the lanes of TRX-wt and TRX-(C62/69/73S) only under oxidizing conditions. In order to understand intranuclear roles of TRX, we constructed nuclear-targeted expression vector of TRX (8Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). TRX lacks an authentic basic nuclear localization signal amino acid sequence (47Chelsky D. Ralph R. Jonak G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2487-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 48Silver P.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 489-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). To prepare nuclear-targeted TRX, we made a fusion construct with yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147), which has a strong nuclear localization signal amino acid sequence and human TRX as pCMX-GAL4-TRX-wt. Because anti-human TRX monoclonal antibody, 11-mAb, does not recognize mouse TRX (41Sasada T. Iwata S. Sato N. Kitaoka Y. Hirota K. Nakamura K. Nishiyama A. Taniguchi Y. Takabayashi A. Yodoi J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2268-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), it is possible to trace the intracellular localization of the overexpressed TRX in NIH3T3 cells with this antibody by immunofluorescent method. At 24 h after transfection of plasmids, immunofluorescent staining showed that human wild-type TRX dominantly existed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 A) and translocated into the nucleus after UVB irradiation (Fig. 5 B); in contrast, GAL4-TRX-wt existed in the nucleus without any treatment (Fig. 5 C) and remained in the nucleus after irradiation (data not shown). To evaluate the function of fusion construct of GAL4-TRX, the TRX activity in transfected cells was analyzed by insulin degradation assay. GAL4-TRX-wt-transfected NIH3T3 cells and TRX-wt showed 1.76- and 1.83-fold increase in TRX activity over mock-transfected cells (Table I).Table IThe TRX activity in the transfected NIH3T3 cellsTRX activityμg/mg proteinMock9.08pcDNA3-TRX-wt16.61pCMX-GAL4-TRX-wt15.96The activity in the transfected NIH3T3 cells was determined by insulin reducing assay.

This activation was independent of the generation of intracellular signals and could be triggered by estradiol conjugated to a membrane-impenetrable carrier protein.

Here it is shown that one of the target genes of Tcf4 in epithelial cells is Tcf1. The most abundant Tcf1 isoforms lack a beta-catenin interaction domain. Tcf1(-/-) mice develop adenomas in the gut and mammary glands. Introduction of a mutant APC allele into these mice substantially increases the number of these adenomas. Tcf1 may act as a feedback repressor of beta-catenin-Tcf4 target genes and thus may cooperate with APC to suppress malignant transformation of epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2060037483,"Alternative splicing of the human glucocorticoid receptor gene generates a nonhormone binding splice variant (hGRβ) that differs from the wild-type receptor (hGRα) only at the carboxyl terminus. Previously we have shown that hGRβ inhibits the transcriptional activity of hGRα, which is consistent with reports of elevated hGRβ expression in patients with generalized and tissue-specific glucocorticoid resistance. The potential role of hGRβ in the regulation of target cell sensitivity to glucocorticoids prompted us to further evaluate its dominant negative activity in other model systems and to investigate its mode of action. We demonstrate in multiple cell types that hGRβ inhibits hGRα-mediated activation of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. In contrast, the ability of the progesterone and androgen receptors to activate this promoter is only weakly affected by hGRβ. hGRβ also inhibits hGRα-mediated repression of an NF-κB-responsive promoter but does not interfere with homologous down-regulation of hGRα. We show that hGRβ can associate with the heat shock protein hsp90 although with lower affinity than hGRα. In addition, hGRβ binds GRE-containing DNA with a greater capacity than hGRα in the absence of glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoid treatment enhances hGRα, but not hGRβ, binding to DNA. Moreover, we demonstrate that hGRα and hGRβ can physically associate with each other in a heterodimer. Finally, we show that the dominant negative activity of hGRβ resides within its unique carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids. Taken together, our results suggest that formation of transcriptionally impaired hGRα-hGRβ heterodimers is an important component of the mechanism responsible for the dominant negative activity of hGRβ.

The ability of both natural and synthetic glucocorticoids to act on a target tissue and elicit specific biological responses is dependent on the presence of the α isoform of the glucocorticoid receptor (GRα). 1The abbreviations used are:GRαglucocorticoid receptor αhGRhGRα, and hGRβ, human glucocorticoid receptor, human glucocorticoid receptor α, and human glucocorticoid receptor β, respectivelyHBDhormone binding domainGREglucocorticoid response elementHREhormone response elementMMTVmouse mammary tumor virusDEXdexamethasoneGSTglutathioneS-transferaseMRmineralocorticoid receptorPRprogesterone receptorhPRBhuman progesterone receptor BARandrogen receptorhARhuman ARDSPdithiobis(succinimidyl propionate)CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseTES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid GRα belongs to the superfamily of steroid/thyroid/retinoic acid receptor proteins that function as ligand-dependent transcription factors (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar). This family also includes receptors for vitamin D and a large group of proteins termed orphan receptors whose ligands and/or functions are unknown. Like other members of this receptor superfamily, GRα is composed of an amino-terminal domain that is involved in gene activation, a central DNA binding domain, and a carboxyl-terminal hormone binding domain (HBD). glucocorticoid receptor α hGRα, and hGRβ, human glucocorticoid receptor, human glucocorticoid receptor α, and human glucocorticoid receptor β, respectively hormone binding domain glucocorticoid response element hormone response element mouse mammary tumor virus dexamethasone glutathioneS-transferase mineralocorticoid receptor progesterone receptor human progesterone receptor B androgen receptor human AR dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid GRα is expressed in almost all tissues and cells, and in the absence of hormone it resides in the cytoplasm of cells as part of a large multiprotein complex. This complex consists of the receptor polypeptide, two molecules of the heat shock protein hsp90, and several additional proteins (2Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21455-21458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Smith D.F. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). When hormone binds the receptor, a conformational change ensues, resulting in the dissociation of hsp90 and the other associated proteins. In its new conformation, GRα translocates into the nucleus, where it binds as a homodimer to glucocorticoid-responsive elements (GREs) located in the regulatory regions of target genes. GRα then communicates with the basal transcription machinery and, depending on the GRE sequence and promoter context, either positively or negatively regulates expression of the linked gene. The receptor can also modulate gene expression apart from DNA binding by physically interacting with other transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-κB (4Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.C.

Ben-Dror I. Fox L.E. Westphal H.M. Vardimon L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4786-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9Nanthakumar N.N. Henning S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G306-G311PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the beneficial effects of glucocorticoids in the treatment of many immune and inflammatory diseases is often limited by the development of glucocorticoid resistance in the diseased tissue (10Sluyser M. Crit. Rev. Oncogen. 1994; 5: 539-554PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis for these variations in glucocorticoid responsiveness is poorly understood. As the sole effector molecule in the glucocorticoid signaling cascade, GRα is the primary target for regulatory events that modulate target cell sensitivity to glucocorticoids. Changes in GRα expression and/or the potency with which GRα functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor will elicit corresponding changes in glucocorticoid responsiveness. Because glucocorticoids profoundly influence all aspects of biological function and are extensively used as therapeutic agents in the treatment of many diseases and disorders, understanding the factors that regulate GRα expression and/or activity, and hence glucocorticoid responsiveness, is an important goal of current research. Alternative splicing of the human GR (hGR) gene produces a splice variant termed hGRβ. hGRβ differs from the wild-type receptor (hGRα) only at the carboxyl terminus (11Hollenberg S.M. Weinberger C.

In contrast to hGRα, hGRβ resides in the nucleus of cells independent of glucocorticoid treatment and does not bind glucocorticoids or activate glucocorticoid-responsive genes (11Hollenberg S.M.

We and others have shown that hGRβ functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of hGRα on both complex and simple glucocorticoid-responsive promoters (13Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol.

The ability of hGRβ to antagonize the function of hGRα suggests that hGRβ will play a critical role in the regulation of target cell sensitivity to glucocorticoids. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that hGRβ expression is elevated in patients suffering from generalized and tissue-specific glucocorticoid resistance (19Leung D.Y.M. Hamid Q. Vottero A.

In the present study, we investigate the ability of hGRβ to repress hGRα in multiple cell types and evaluate how much hGRβ (relative to hGRα) is necessary for the observed repression. hGRβ's dominant negative activity is further explored on other closely related steroid hormone receptors and on genes negatively regulated by glucocorticoids. We also assess the ability of hGRβ to associate with hsp90, bind GRE-containing DNA, and heterodimerize with hGRα in order to understand the mechanism responsible for the dominant negative activity of hGRβ. Finally, we investigate whether the hGRβ-specific amino acids mediate this repression of hGRα function. Dexamethasone (DEX) and progesterone were purchased from Steraloids (Wilton, NH), and the synthetic androgen R1881 was obtained from NEN Life Science Products.

Site-directed mutagenesis by polymerase chain reaction was employed to generate the truncated receptor pCMVhGR728T. Nucleotides GTG, encoding valine at amino acid 728 of hGRα, were replaced with TAG, which mutates the valine to a stop codon.

COS-1, CV-1, and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% (v/v) of a mixture (1:1) of heat-inactivated fetal calf and calf serum. All cultures were maintained in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and passaged every 3–4 days. For transfection of cells, medium was removed from subconfluent cells and replaced with fresh Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 3% serum. Plasmid DNA was prepared as a calcium phosphate precipitate, and the total amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant by the addition of empty vector (pCMV5) and salmon sperm DNA. The precipitates were incubated with cells for 5 h. The medium was then removed, and the cells were shocked for 30 s with 15% glycerol and then refed with fully supplemented medium stripped of endogenous steroids. Cells were transfected as described above and in the appropriate figure legends. Immediately after the transfection, DEX or vehicle was added to the cells, which were then incubated an additional 18 h. Cells were harvested, lysates were prepared, and luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Luciferase activity was calculated per μg of protein for each sample. Cells were transfected as described above and in the appropriate figure legend. Immediately after the transfection, the appropriate steroid (DEX, progesterone, or R1881) or vehicle was added to the cells. After an 18-h incubation, cells were harvested, and CAT assays were performed as described previously (13Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol.

Equivalent amounts of protein were adjusted to 156 mm Tris, 1 mm acetyl coenzyme A, and 0.1 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol in a final volume of 150 μl. The CAT reaction was then allowed to proceed for 16 h at 37 °C. Samples were applied to a thin layer chromatography plate and chromatographed in chloroform/methanol (95:5). After autoradiography, CAT activity was quantitated by excising the appropriate area from the thin layer chromatography plate and counting the [14C]chloramphenicol and acetylated derivatives in a Beckman LS 7000 scintillation counter. Transfected cells were harvested and lysed in TENT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmEDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin). Proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were stained with Ponceau S to evaluate loading equivalency and transfer efficiency and were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 10% nonfat dry milk. Blots was then washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% nonfat dry milk (TBS-1%) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate dilution of primary antibody in TBS-1%.

The hsp90 monoclonal antibody AC88 was used at 6 μg/ml and was kindly provided by Dr. G. R. Pearson (28Riehl R.M. Sullivan W.P. Vroman B.T. Bauer V.J. Pearson G.R. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6586-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Membranes were subsequently washed in TBS-1%, reacted for 1 h at room temperature with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody in TBS-1%, washed in TBS-1%, reacted with chemiluminescent reagents, and then processed for autoradiography. Blots were stripped by incubating at 55 °C for 45 min in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol. hGRα, hGRβ, and hGR728T signals were quantitated densitometrically using NIH Image analysis software. Poly(A)+ RNA (5 μg) from transfected cells was isolated, electrophoresed, and transferred as described previously (29Silva C.M. Powell-Oliver F.E. Jewell C.M. Sar M. Allgood V.A. Cidlowski J.A. Steroids. 1994; 59: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). After transfer, the RNA was UV-cross-linked to the membrane and subsequently stained with methylene blue (0.04% methylene blue, 0.5 m NaOAc, pH 5.2) to examine both the integrity of the RNA and the completeness of the transfer. Membranes were prehybridized (3 h at 65 °C) and hybridized (18 h at 65 °C) in 50% formamide, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution, 2% SDS, 200 μg/ml yeast RNA, and 200 μg/ml denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA. The [α-32P]UTP-labeled hGRα or hGRβ-specific cRNA probes, which have been described previously (13Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), were included in the hybridization fluid (1 × 106 cpm/ml). Following hybridization, blots were washed once at room temperature and four times at 65 °C in 0.1× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 0.1% SDS. To control for loading differences in RNA, membranes were stripped (30-min incubation in 0.1× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 0.1% SDS heated to 100 °C) and reprobed with a β-actin cRNA probe. The hGRα and hGRβ mRNA signals were quantitated densitometrically using NIH Image analysis software and normalized to β-actin mRNA levels. For immunoprecipitation of receptor-hsp90 complexes from whole cells, transfected cells were lysed using a Dounce homogenizer in HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium molybdate) containing protease inhibitors. The homogenate was centrifuged at 165,000 × g in a Beckman 50 Ti rotor for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Proteins (200 μg) were precleared with preimmune serum and protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and transferred to a new tube. The antipeptide hGR antibody 59 (1:50 dilution) or preimmune serum was added and each tube incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation (21Cidlowski J.A. Bellingham D.L. Powell-Oliver F.E. Lubahn D.B. Sar M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1427-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For binding immune complexes, 80 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) were added, and the incubation continued an additional 30 min at 4 °C with rotation. Protein A-Sepharose was prepared in TEGM buffer (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 4 mm EDTA, 50 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm sodium molybdate). The protein A-Sepharose immune complexes were washed four times with 1 ml of TEGM buffer and then resuspended in sample buffer containing 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.2 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the protein A-Sepharose by boiling 5 min and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoretically transferring the proteins to nitrocellulose, immunoblotting was carried out as described above. Immunoprecipitation of receptor-hsp90 complexes from reticulocyte lysates expressing equivalent amounts of35S-labeled hGRα or 35S-labeled hGRβ was performed using the anti-hsp90 monoclonal antibody 3G3 (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO) essentially as described (30McGuire J. Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I. Gustafsson J.-A. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). DNA binding analysis was carried out essentially as described previously (27Burnstein K.L. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The hGRα and hGRβ proteins were synthesized in vitro using reticulocyte lysates. Translation products (5 fmol) were incubated with an equal volume of DNA binding buffer (20 mm NaHPO4, pH 7, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol) for 2 h at 0 °C with or without 200 nm DEX. Lysates were then heat-activated for 30 min at 25 °C, after which they were transferred to tubes coated with 1% BSA. An 868-base pair ClaI/SphI fragment containing the MMTV long terminal repeat from plasmid pLTR190 or a 777-bp PstI/ClaI fragment from the plasmid pBR322 was labeled on one end with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow to fill in the ClaI-generated 5′ overhang. Labeled DNA fragments (10-fold molar excess) and nonspecific DNA (poly(dI-dC) at a 50-fold excess and Escherichia coli DNA at a 50-fold excess) were added to the lysates, and the incubation continued at 0 °C for 2 h. For some experiments, unlabeled competitor DNA was added at a 50-fold excess. Antipeptide hGR antibody 57 (1:50 dilution) was then added to the lysates, and the incubation continued for 2 h at 0 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (133 mg/ml DNA binding buffer) was then added to the lysates for an additional 1-h incubation, and the pellets were subsequently washed four times with 1 ml of DNA binding buffer. DNA fragments were recovered from the pellets by phenol chloroform extraction and analyzed on 8 m urea, 4% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were fixed in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 15 min, dried for 1 h under vacuum at 60 °C, and processed for autoradiography. The hGRα and hGRβ proteins were synthesized in vitro using reticulocyte lysates. Thirty-five μl of 35S-labeled hGRα translation mix were added to 35 μl of unlabeled hGRβ translation mix or 35 μl of unprogrammed translation mix and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 200 nm DEX, and protease inhibitors. An aliquot was then removed from each tube to verify that equivalent amounts of hGRα were present in each mixture. Proteins were cross-linked by the addition of 2.5 mm DSP for 10 min at room temperature. Reactions were then terminated by the addition of 0.1 m ethanolamine. The cross-linked proteins were diluted in immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 m ethanolamine, and protease inhibitors), precleared, and immunoprecipitated with the hGRβ-specific antibody BShGR (16Oakley R.H. Webster J.C. Sar M. Parker C.R. Cidlowski J.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5028-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were recovered, washed extensively in the immunoprecipitation buffer, and resuspended in Laemmli buffer with or without β-mercaptoethanol. After proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, gels were fixed in 30% methanol-10% acetic acid for 30 min, dried for 1 h under vacuum at 60 °C, and processed for autoradiography using liquid EN3HANCE. GST pull-down assays were carried out essentially as described (31Hong H. Kohli K. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4948-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In brief, the GST-hGRαHBD and GST-hGRβHBD fusion proteins were induced in DH5α E. coliby the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside to log phase cells. Following a 4-h incubation, the cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, and protease inhibitors. Following centrifugation, the soluble protein extract was incubated with phosphate-buffered saline-washed glutathione agarose in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The immobilized fusion proteins were then incubated with full-length,in vitro translated 35S-labeled hGRα or35S-labeled hGRβ treated with or without 1 μm DEX. Assays were carried out at 4 °C with constant rotation in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). Recovered proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and processed as described above. We have demonstrated previously in HeLa S3 cells that hGRβ can inhibit the transcriptional activity of hGRα in a dominant negative fashion (13Oakley R.H. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9550-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). This early study, however, did not investigate whether the dominant negative activity occurred in other cell types; nor did it determine how much hGRβ (relative to hGRα) was needed for the observed repression. To address these issues, we initially analyzed the ability of hGRβ to repress hGRα-mediated activation of the glucocorticoid-responsive MMTV promoter in transfected COS-1 cells. COS-1 cells (which are devoid of endogenous GR) were transfected with a fixed amount of the MMTV-luciferase reporter pHHluc, a fixed amount of th"

Here, a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding a blood serine protease inhibitor, Spn43Ac, was shown to lead to constitutive expression of the antifungal peptide drosomycin, and this effect was mediated by the spaetzle and Toll gene products. Spaetzle was cleaved by proteolytic enzymes to its active ligand form shortly after immune challenge, and cleaved Spaetzle was constitutively present in Spn43Ac-deficient flies. Hence, Spn43Ac negatively regulates the Toll signaling pathway, and Toll does not function as a pattern recognition receptor in the Drosophila host defense."
https://openalex.org/W1974405307,"The bacterial pathogen Yersinia uses a type III secretion system to inject several virulence factors into target cells. One of the Yersinia virulence factors, YopJ, was shown to bind directly to the superfamily of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) kinases (MKKs) blocking both phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the MKKs. These results explain the diverse activities of YopJ in inhibiting the extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, p38, and nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathways, preventing cytokine synthesis and promoting apoptosis. YopJ-related proteins that are found in a number of bacterial pathogens of animals and plants may function to block MKKs so that host signaling responses can be modulated upon infection."

In contrast, the (56)Fe/(54)Fe of Fe-bearing phases in igneous rocks from Earth and the moon does not vary measurably (delta(56)Fe = 0.0 +/- 0.3 per mil). Experiments with dissimilatory Fe-reducing bacteria of the genus Shewanella algae grown on a ferrihydrite substrate indicate that the delta(56)Fe of ferrous Fe in solution is isotopically lighter than the ferrihydrite substrate by 1.3 per mil. Therefore, the range in delta(56)Fe values of sedimentary rocks may reflect biogenic fractionation, and the isotopic composition of Fe may be used to trace the distribution of microorganisms in modern and ancient Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2079230681,"The effects of a transient exposure to hydrogen peroxide (10 min at 200 μmH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) on pancreatic beta cell signal transduction and insulin secretion have been evaluated. In rat islets, insulin secretion evoked by glucose (16.7 mm) or by the mitochondrial substrate methyl succinate (5 mm) was markedly blunted following exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In contrast, the secretory response induced by plasma membrane depolarization (20 mm KCl) was not significantly affected. Similar results were obtained in insulinoma INS-1 cells using glucose (12.8 mm) as secretagogue. After H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, glucose no longer depolarized the membrane potential (ΔΨ) of INS-1 cells or increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Both ΔΨ and Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were still observed with 30 mm KCl despite an elevated baseline of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> appearing ∼10 min after exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The mitochondrial ΔΨ of INS-1 cells was depolarized by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> abolishing the hyperpolarizing action of glucose. These ΔΨ changes correlated with altered mitochondrial morphology; the latter was not preserved by the overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> was increased following exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> up to the micromolar range. No further augmentation occurred after glucose addition, which normally raises this parameter. Nevertheless, KCl was still efficient in enhancing mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Cytosolic ATP was markedly reduced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, probably explaining the decreased endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Taken together, these data point to the mitochondria as primary targets for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> damage, which will eventually interrupt the transduction of signals normally coupling glucose metabolism to insulin secretion."

https://openalex.org/W2080625914,"hHR23B is one of two human homologs of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae nucleotide excision repair (NER) gene product RAD23 and a component of a protein complex that specifically complements the NER defect of xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XP-C) cell extracts in vitro. Although a small proportion of hHR23B is tightly complexed with the XP-C responsible gene product, XPC protein, a vast majority exists as an XPC-free form, indicating that hHR23B has additional functions other than NER in vivo. Here we demonstrate that the human NER factor hHR23B as well as another human homolog of RAD23, hHR23A, interact specifically with S5a, a subunit of the human 26 S proteasome using the yeast two-hybrid system. Furthermore, hHR23 proteins were detected with S5a at the position where 26 S proteasome sediments in glycerol gradient centrifugation of HeLa S100 extracts. Intriguingly, hHR23B showed the inhibitory effect on the degradation of 125I-lysozyme in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate. hHR23 proteins thus appear to associate with 26 S proteasome in vivo. From co-precipitation experiments using several series of deletion mutants, we defined the domains in hHR23B and S5a that mediate this interaction. From these results, we propose that part of hHR23 proteins are involved in the proteolytic pathway in cells."

Appressoria have been shown to generate enormous turgor pressure, but direct evidence for mechanical infection of plants by fungi is lacking. A microscopic method was developed that uses elastic optical waveguides to visualize and measure forces locally exerted by single appressoria. By this method, the force exerted by appressoria of C. graminicola was found to be about 17 micronewtons."

Tensile cracks may have developed such a pattern in response to diurnal variations in tidal stress in Europa's outer ice shell. When the tensile strength of the ice is reached, a crack may occur. Propagating cracks would move across an ever-changing stress field, following a curving path to a place and time where the tensile stress was insufficient to continue the propagation. A few hours later, when the stress at the end of the crack again exceeded the strength, propagation would continue in a new direction. Thus, one arcuate segment of the cycloidal chain would be produced during each day on Europa. For this model to work, the tensile strength of Europa's ice crust must be less than 40 kilopascals, and there must be a thick fluid layer below the ice to allow sufficient tidal amplitude."
https://openalex.org/W2079620293,Lasing action has been demonstrated at blue wavelengths in vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers at room temperature. The microcavity was formed by sandwiching indium gallium nitride multiple quantum wells between nitride-based and oxide-based quarter-wave reflectors. Lasing action was observed at a wavelength of 399 nanometers under optical excitation and confirmed by a narrowing of the linewidth in the emission spectra from 0.8 nanometer below threshold to less than 0.1 nanometer (resolution limit) above threshold. The result suggests that practical blue vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers can be realized in gallium-nitride–based material systems.

NF-κB plays a critical role in activation of HIV-1 gene expression by cytokines and other stimuli, but the signal transduction pathways that regulate the switch from latent to productive infection have not been defined. Here, we show that ERK1/ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays a central role in linking signals at the cell surface to activation of HIV-1 gene expression in latently infected cells. MAPK was activated by cytokines and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in latently infected U1 cells. The induction of HIV-1 expression by these stimuli was inhibited by PD98059 and U0126, which are specific inhibitors of MAPK activation. Studies using constitutively active MEK or Raf kinase mutants demonstrated that MAPK activates the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) through the NF-κB sites. Most HIV-1 inducers activated NF-κB via a MAPK-independent pathway, indicating that activation of NF-κB is not sufficient to explain the activation of HIV-1 gene expression by MAPK. In contrast, all of the stimuli activated AP-1 via a MAPK-dependent pathway. NF-κB and AP-1 components c-Fos and c-Jun were shown to physically associate by yeast two-hybrid assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Coexpression of NF-κB and c-Fos or c-Jun synergistically transactivated the HIV-1 LTR through the NF-κB sites. These studies suggest that MAPK acts by stimulating AP-1 and a subsequent physical and functional interaction of AP-1 with NF-κB, resulting in a complex that synergistically transactivates the HIV-1 LTR. These results define a mechanism for signal-dependent activation of HIV-1 replication in latently infected cells and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for unmasking latent reservoirs of HIV-1.

In latently infected cells that harbor an integrated copy of the HIV-1 genome, the integrated provirus is transcriptionally silent or expresses only multiply spliced transcripts encoding viral regulatory proteins (i.e. Tat, Rev, and Nef) at low levels but little or no full-length viral RNA (20Pomerantz R.J.

Viral latency has been postulated to be maintained by limiting cellular levels of Tat or Rev (24Adams M. Sharmeen L. Kimpton J. Romeo J.M. Garcia J.V. Peterlin B.M. Groudine M. Emerman M. Proc. Natl.

The state of activation of the cell also plays an important role (2McCune J.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 183-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For example, Tat may not be fully functional in quiescent cells (9Cullen B.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2361-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 10Cullen B.R.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases are the central mediators that propagate extracellular signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus. These serine/threonine kinases are present in all cell types and play a critical role in regulation of a wide variety of biological response mechanisms. The ERK1/ERK2 group of mitogen-activated protein kinases (also called p44/42 MAPK, hereafter referred to as MAPK) is a central component of signal transduction pathways activated by diverse extracellular stimuli, including mitogens, growth factors, and cytokines (28Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). MAPK itself is activated by phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues by the MAPK kinase (also known as MEK). Upon activation by MEK via the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade, MAPK mediates biological responses involved in cell proliferation and differentiation by phosphorylating a large number of substrates including transcription factors such as c-Myc, AP-1, NF-IL6, ATF-2, and Elk-1 (28Davis R.J.

Other mitogen-activated protein kinases in mammalian cells are c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and p38/HOG, which are activated by stress stimuli and inflammatory cytokines (30Kyriakis J.M.

We performed studies in the U1 human monocytic cell line, an in vitro model for postintegration HIV-1 latency (36Folks T.M. Justement J. Kinter A. Dinarello C.A. Fauci A.S.

U1 cells contain two integrated copies of the HIV-1 genome and under unstimulated conditions express low levels of viral transcripts encoding Tat, Rev, and Nef but little or no full-length viral RNA (20Pomerantz R.J.

Here, we demonstrate that activation of MAPK is required for induction of HIV-1 gene expression in latently infected U1 cells by cytokines and other stimuli. MAPK acts by stimulating AP-1 and a subsequent physical and functional interaction of AP-1 with NF-κB, resulting in a complex that synergistically transactivates the HIV-1 LTR. These results define a mechanism for signal-dependent activation of HIV-1 replication in latently infected cells. pLTR-Luc was made by subcloning the 720-base pairXhoI–HindIII fragment containing the HIV-1 LTR from the pNL4–3 HIV-1 proviral DNA plasmid into pGL3-Luc+basic (Promega). pLTRs-Luc was made by deleting LTR sequences upstream from the κB sites (a 480-base pair AvaI–AvaI fragment) from pLTR-Luc. pLTRmκB-Luc, derived from pLTR-Luc, contains mutations of the two NF-κB binding sites within the LTR (40Nabel G.

HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. U937 cells (107 cells) were transfected with 10 μg of pLTR-CAT alone or together with 5 μg of the pSVLTat HIV-1 Tat expression plasmid by the DEAE-dextran method (44Yang X. Gabuzda D. J. Biol.

To maintain the same amount of transfected DNA, the total amount of DNA was adjusted using the vector control plasmid pSG5. After a 12-h incubation, the medium was replaced with 10% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. At 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity (Promega). Transfection efficiencies were monitored and normalized by cotransfection of a pCMV-βgal vector for β-galactosidase. Immunoblotting of U1 or HeLa cell lysates was performed with anti-p24 (Intracell), antiphospho-MAPK (New England Biolabs), or anti-ERK1 and anti-ERK2 MAPK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) as described (44Yang X.

Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Antibodies to NF-κB p65 (1 μl), c-Fos, and c-Jun (1 or 2 μl) (anti-NFκB(A), anti-cFos(4–10G), and anti-cJun(N), respectively, from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal rabbit serum (1 μl) was preincubated on ice with nuclear extracts prepared from U1 cells stimulated with TNF-α for 40 min before the addition of the32P-labeled oligonucleotides and performing EMSAs using a probe containing the HIV-1 LTR κB sites. After 20 min at room temperature, samples were loaded onto a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and run in 0.5× TBE buffer. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. A yeast two-hybrid system (MatchMaker System 2, CLONTECH) was used to examine interactions between NF-κB and c-Fos or c-Jun. The NF-κB p65 gene was amplified by PCR from pRSVRel-p65 and inserted into pAS2-1 in fusion with the Gal4 DNA binding domain. The c-Fos and c-Jun genes were amplified by PCR from pRSV-cFos and pRSV-cJun, respectively, and inserted into PAS2-1 or pACT2 in fusion with the Gal4 DNA binding or activation domain, respectively. These plasmids were transformed into the yeast strain CG-1945, and transformants were selected on SD/-Leu, SD/-Trp, or SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His medium. The interaction of NF-κB and c-Fos or c-Jun was analyzed according to the manufacturer's protocol. To examine a potential role of MAPK in mediating activation of latent HIV-1, we first studied whether MAPK is activated by stimuli that activate HIV-1 gene expression in latently infected cells by using the MEK inhibitor PD98059, which specifically inhibits activation of MAPK (48Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar, 49Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). The high degree of specificity of PD98059 is indicated by its failure to inhibit >20 other serine/threonine kinases, including other MEK homologs (i.e. c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and p38/HOG kinase kinases) (48Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). MAPK phosphorylation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or cytokines was demonstrated by immunoblotting with antiphospho-MAPK, which specifically detects MAPK only when activated by phosphorylation (Fig.1 A). Equivalent amounts of MAPK were present in all samples (Fig. 1 A), indicating that these stimuli induced activation rather than increased expression of MAPK. PD98059 abolished MAPK phosphorylation induced by these stimuli (Fig. 1 A). The induction of HIV-1 expression by PMA or TNF-α was suppressed by PD98059 in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of approximately 10 μm, and 90–98% inhibition at 50 μm (Fig. 1, Band C). This suppression was not due to cytotoxic effects of the drug as determined by trypan blue staining and counting the number of viable cells (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were obtained using the latently infected T cell line ACH-2 and promyelocytic cell line OM10.1 (23Butera S.T. Roberts B.D. Lam L. Hodge T. Folks T.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2726-2730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). PD98059 also inhibited the induction of HIV-1 expression by IL-1β and IL-6 alone or in combination by 95–98%, while induction by TNF-α/IL-6 was inhibited by 70% (Fig.1 C). The induction of HIV-1 protein synthesis by PMA or cytokines was also inhibited by PD98059 (Fig. 1 D), with the same dose dependence as that observed for inhibition of virus production measured by reverse transcriptase assays (data not shown). The level of MAPK activation induced by the different stimuli correlated directly with the level of activation of HIV-1 expression (Fig. 1, A, C, and D). Conversely, the inhibition of MAPK activation by PD98059 correlated with its inhibitory effects on induction of HIV-1 expression (Fig. 1, B andC). U0126, another MEK inhibitor, which specifically inhibits activation of MAPK (50Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar), also inhibited the induction of HIV-1 expression by PMA, TNF-α, and TNF-α/IL-6 (Fig.1 E), similar to the inhibition by PD98059 (Fig.1 C). These results suggest that activation of MAPK plays a critical role in the induction of HIV-1 expression in U1 cells. To determine whether MAPK mediates induction of HIV-1 expression through activation of the HIV-1 LTR, we transfected U937 cells, the uninfected parental cell line of U1, with an HIV-1 LTR chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid (Fig.2 A). Transfected cells were then stimulated with PMA or cytokines in the presence or absence of PD98059 and assayed for CAT activity. The induction of HIV-1 LTR expression by the different stimuli was inhibited by PD98059 (Fig.2 B, left). However, PD98059 had little or no effect on activation of the HIV-1 LTR induced by coexpression of an HIV-1 Tat expression plasmid (Fig. 2 B, middle andright), indicating that MAPK does not affect Tat transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR. We next examined whether activation of MAPK is sufficient to induce expression of the HIV-1 LTR. HeLa cells were transfected with an HIV-1 LTR luciferase reporter plasmid (Fig. 2 A) together with MEK or Raf kinase expressor plasmids. Expression of constitutively active mutant MEK (41Mansour S.J.

Virol. 1996; 70: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), increased luciferase expression by 8–33-fold, whereas dominant negative mutant MEK or Raf had no significant effect (Fig.2 C). Thus, activation of MAPK through the Raf/MEK pathway can activate the HIV-1 LTR. The HIV-1 LTR contains NF-AT sites at −255 to −217, NF-κB sites at −104 to −81, and Sp1 sites at −78 to −47 (Fig. 2 A). Deletion of sequences upstream from the κB sites between positions −641 and −158 did not affect activation of the HIV-1 LTR by coexpression of constitutively active mutant MEK or Raf (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, when the NF-κB binding sites were mutated, HIV-1 LTR expression was not significantly induced by coexpression of these mutant kinases (Fig. 2 C). The HIV-1 LTR lacking NF-κB sites was not activated by TNF-α, TNF-α/IL-6, or PMA but could still be activated by sodium butyrate (18Antoni B.A. Rabson A.B. Kinter A. Bodkin M. Poli G. Virology. 1994; 202: 684-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) alone or together with TNF-α (Fig. 2 D). Thus, this mutant HIV-1 LTR can still be activated by NF-κB-independent mechanisms (15Poli G. Bressler P. Kinter A. Duh B. Timmer W.C. Rabson A. Justement J.S. Stanley S. Fauci A.S. J. Exp.

https://openalex.org/W1973677690,"Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339–340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of ∼40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC50 of 3 nm. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of125I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC50 of 13 nm. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be ∼10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (Nomiyama, H., Osborne, L. R., Imai, T., Kusuda, J., Miura, R., Tsui, L.-C., and Yoshie, O. (1998) Genomics 49, 339–340). Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, unknown chemokines may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new chromosomal loci. Prompted by this hypothesis, we analyzed the genomic region containing the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and have identified a novel CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of ∼40 kilobases. By Northern blot analysis, eotaxin-3 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary. We have generated recombinant eotaxin-3 in a baculovirus expression system. Eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization specifically in CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3)-expressing L1.2 cells with an EC50 of 3 nm. Eotaxin-3 competed the binding of125I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with an IC50 of 13 nm. Eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils at high concentrations. Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be ∼10-fold less than that of eotaxin. Identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of the control of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated biological phenomena. The strategy used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokine genes. Chemokines are a group of structurally related, mostly basic, heparin-binding cytokines that play important roles in inflammatory and immunological processes by their capacity to recruit selective subsets of leukocytes (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar, 2Rollins B. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yoshie O. Imai T.

Chemokines are divided into two major subfamilies, CXC and CC, based on the arrangement of the first two of the four conserved cysteine residues; the two cysteines are separated by a single amino acid in CXC chemokines and are adjacent in CC chemokines. Furthermore, lymphotactin/single C motif 1, which retains only the second and fourth of the four cysteine residues conserved in other chemokines, and fractalkine/neurotactin, a transmembrane molecule with an N-terminal chemokine domain with a unique CX 3C motif, represent the new C and CX 3C subfamilies (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar, 2Rollins B. Blood. 1997; 90: 909-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yoshie O. Imai T.

Classically, CXC chemokines mainly attract neutrophils, and their genes are clustered on chromosome 4q12-q21, whereas CC chemokines mainly attract monocytes, and their genes are clustered on chromosome 17q11.2. It is now known, however, that CXC chemokines with an ELR motif just prior to the first cysteine residue are potent chemoattractants for neutrophils, and their genes are clustered on chromosome 4q12-q21, whereas those without the ELR motif act mainly on lymphocytes, and their genes are localized to different chromosomal loci. Similarly, a number of novel CC chemokines, which are highly specific for lymphocytes and dendritic cells, have their genes mapped to loci different from the major CC chemokine gene cluster at chromosome 17q11.2 (3Yoshie O. Imai T. Nomiyama H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 634-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there are several miniclusters of chemokine genes outside the major chemokine gene clusters (3Yoshie O. Imai T. Nomiyama H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 634-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, unknown chemokine genes may be present in the vicinity of chemokine genes mapped to new chromosomal loci. Accumulation of eosinophils in the blood and affected tissues is a classical sign of inflammatory responses to helminths and allergens. Even though eosinophils are important effector cells against helminths, they are also implicated in tissue damages in allergic diseases. Because of the pathologic potential of eosinophils, identification of specific factors that regulate their accumulation in tissues is important. Using an experimental model of asthma in guinea pigs, Joseet al. (5Jose P.J. Griffiths-Johnson D.A. Collins P.D. Walsh D.T. Moqbel R. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Williams T.J. J. Exp.

Subsequently, we (6Kitaura M. Nakajima T. Imai T. Harada S. Combadiere C. Tiffany H.L. Murphy P.M. Yoshie O. J. Biol.

Recently, the novel CC chemokine myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2 (MPIF-2)/eotaxin-2 was reported as a new ligand for CCR3 (12Patel V.P. Kreider P.L. Li Y. Li H. Keung K. Salcedo T. Nardelli B.

Langen H. Thelen M. Baggiolini M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 2171-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We have mapped the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) to human chromosome 7q11.23 (14Nomiyama H. Osborne L.R. Imai T. Kusuda J. Miura R. Tsui L.-C. Yoshie O. Genomics. 1998; 49: 339-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Human chromosome 7 is one of the main sequencing targets of the Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University. From the sequencing-in-progress data of the center, we have identified a sequence that contains the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2. In an attempt to identify a novel chemokine gene, we carried out an exon search on this sequence with the DNA sequence analysis tool GRAIL (15Uberbacher E.C. Mural R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11261-11265Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). We have identified a novel CC chemokine in the vicinity of eotaxin-2 and have shown that this chemokine is another functional ligand for CCR3.

Eotaxin, MCP-1, TARC (thymus andactivation-regulated chemokine), LARC (liver andactivation-regulated chemokine), SLC (secondary lymphoid tissuechemokine), and fractalkine were prepared as described previously (16Yoshida R.

The panel of murine L1.2 pre-B cells stably transfected with the known CC chemokine receptors and orphan receptors was described previously (16Yoshida R. Nagira M. Kitaura M. Imagawa N. Imai T. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7118-7122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Peripheral blood eosinophils were isolated as follows. Heparinized venous blood was obtained from healthy donors. After sedimentation with dextran, red blood cells were lysed by hyposmotic treatment, and mononuclear cells were removed by Ficoll-Paque sedimentation. Neutrophils were depleted by magnetic cell sorting (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch, Germany) after labeling cells with anti-CD16 microbeads. The purity of eosinophils thus obtained was determined by standard cytological staining and was routinely >95%. Basophils were semipurified from heparinized blood by Percoll density gradient centrifugation as described previously (18Yamada H. Hirai K. Miyamasu M. Iikura M. Misaki Y. Shoji S. Takaishi T. Kasahara T. Morita Y. Ito K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The purity of basophils was routinely ∼20%. The human genome sequence data base of the Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University was searched for the MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 nucleotide sequence using BLAST Search. A sequence (H_RG356E01.seq) was found to contain the genomic sequence of MPIF-2/eotaxin-2. Using the DNA sequence analysis tool GRAIL (15Uberbacher E.C. Mural R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11261-11265Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), we identified the sequence of a novel chemokine in this genomic sequence. The full-length cDNA sequence was obtained by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method (19Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) using human lung Marathon-ReadyTMcDNA (CLONTECH) as a template. Two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out. The cDNA was first amplified with the first gene-specific primer (5′-RACE primer, CTTCAGAAAAGATTCCGCAGGCTCCCCAGAG; and 3′-RACE primer, CATATCCAAGACCTGCTGCTTCCAATACAGCC) and AP1 primer (CLONTECH), which is complementary to the adapter ligated at both ends of the cDNA. PCR was performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 0.2 mm each dNTP, 4 pmol of each primer, 0.625 units of AmpliTaq GoldTM (Perkin-Elmer), and 1× buffer supplied with the polymerase. The amplification reaction was carried out as follows: 94 °C for 5 min; then 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and finally, 72 °C for 5 min. Nested PCR was carried out using the primary PCR products as templates. The cDNA was amplified with the second gene-specific primer (5′-RACE primer, GCTCTAGACAATTGTTTCGGAGTTTTCAGTAAAGAA; and 3′-RACE primer, TTCCCTGGACCTGGGTGCGAAGCTA) and the AP2 primer (CLONTECH), which is complementary to the cDNA adapter ligated at both ends of the cDNA. PCR was performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 0.2 mm each dNTP, 10 pmol of each primer, 1.25 units of AmpliTaq GoldTM, and 1× buffer supplied with the polymerase. The amplification reaction was carried out as follows: 94 °C for 5 min; then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and finally, 72 °C for 5 min. The amplification products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) by T-A ligation and sequenced on both strands. This was carried out as described previously (16Yoshida R. Nagira M. Kitaura M. Imagawa N. Imai T. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7118-7122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In brief, a multiple-tissue blot filter was purchased from CLONTECH. The filter was hybridized with the32P-labeled eotaxin-3 cDNA probe at 65 °C for 1 h in QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene) containing denatured salmon sperm DNA at 100 μg/ml. After washing at 65 °C for 30 min in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS, filters were exposed to x-ray films at −80 °C with an intensifying screen for 1 week. Recombinant eotaxin-3 was prepared using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, the eotaxin-3 cDNA containing the entire coding region was excised withBamHI and XhoI and subcloned into theBamHI-XhoI sites of the pFastBac1 baculovirus transfer vector downstream of the polyhedrin gene promoter. The resulting recombinant plasmid, pFastBac-eotaxin-3, was transformed intoEscherichia coli DH10Bac containing a shuttle vector “bacmid” with a mini-attTn7 target site and the helper plasmid. The mini-Tn element on the pFastBac1 plasmid transposes to the mini-attTn7 target site on the bacmid in the presence of transposition protein provided by the helper plasmid. Insertion of the mini-Tn7 element into the mini-attTn7 target site disrupts the lacZ coding sequence, making colonies containing recombinant bacmids white in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside. The resulting recombinant bacmid was transfected into Sf9 cells using Cellfectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the recombinant virus was obtained. High FiveTM cells (Invitrogen) were infected with the recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10–20. The culture supernatants collected 2 days after infection were cleared by filtration through 0.22-μm membranes and were dialyzed against 50 mm MES (pH 6.5) and 0.1 m NaCl and applied to a 1-ml cation-exchange HiTrap S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mm MES (pH 6.5) and 0.1 mNaCl. The column in the fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was eluted with 45 ml of a liner gradient of 0.1–1.0 m NaCl in 50 ml of MES at a rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions containing recombinant eotaxin-3 were pooled and injected into a reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography column (4.6 × 250 mm Cosmocil 5C4-AR-300, Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was eluted with 60 ml of 0–60% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing recombinant eotaxin-3 were pooled and lyophilized. Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA kit (Pierce). The amino-terminal sequence analysis was done in a protein sequencer (Shimazu, Tokyo). This was carried out as described previously (16Yoshida R. Nagira M. Kitaura M. Imagawa N. Imai T. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7118-7122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were suspended at 3 × 106 cells/ml in buffer A (Hanks' balanced saline solution supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.4)) and incubated with 2 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at 37 °C for 1 h in the dark. Cells were washed twice with buffer A and resuspended at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. To measure intracellular calcium, 2 ml of the cell suspension was placed in a quartz cuvette. Emission fluorescence at 510 nm was measured upon excitation at 340 and 380 nm every 0.2 s on an LS 50B spectrofluorometer (Perkin-Elmer) to obtain the ratio of fluorescence intensity (R 340/380 nm). To determine EC50, a dose-response curve was generated. A displacement-type binding assay was carried out as described previously (20Imai T. Yoshida T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21514-21521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In brief, 1 × 106 cells were incubated for 1 h at 15 °C with 125I-labeled eotaxin (specific activity, 2000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitors in 200 μl of 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After incubation, cells were separated from unbound radiolabeled ligands by centrifugation through a mixture of dibutyl phthalate/olive oil (4:1). All assays were done in duplicate. The chemotaxis assay was performed using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber as described previously (20Imai T. Yoshida T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21514-21521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In brief, chemoattractants were diluted in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and placed in the lower wells (25 μl/well). Cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium, 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), and 1% bovine serum albumin at 2 × 106 cells/ml and added to the upper wells (50 μl/well), which were separated from the lower wells by a polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filter with 5-μm pores. The chamber was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2and 95% air. Filters were removed, and cells that migrated were stained with Diff-Quik. Basophils that migrated were stained with toluidine blue (18Yamada H. Hirai K. Miyamasu M. Iikura M. Misaki Y. Shoji S. Takaishi T. Kasahara T. Morita Y. Ito K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cells that migrated were counted in 5–10 randomly selected high-power fields (×400) per well. All assays were done in triplicate. Previously, we mapped the gene for the novel CC chemokine MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) to chromosome 7q11.23 (14Nomiyama H. Osborne L.R. Imai T. Kusuda J. Miura R. Tsui L.-C. Yoshie O. Genomics. 1998; 49: 339-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). By analyzing the human genomic DNA sequence data base of the Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University by BLAST Search, we identified the genomic sequence derived from chromosome 7 that contains the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (H_RG356E01.seq). In an attempt to identify a novel chemokine gene in the vicinity of the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2, we carried out an exon search on this genomic sequence using the DNA sequence analysis tool GRAIL (15Uberbacher E.C. Mural R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11261-11265Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Two exon sequences corresponding to the second and third exons of a chemokine-like protein were found at a site ∼40 kilobases apart from the gene for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2. The sequencing of H_RG356E01.seq (107 kilobases) has now been completed and deposited in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank with accession number AC005102. The physical map of the region is shown in Fig.1. To determine the full-length cDNA sequence of a putative novel chemokine, we generated primers based on these genomic sequences and carried out 5′- and 3′-RACE (19Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) using human lung Marathon-ReadyTM cDNA as a template. As shown in Fig. 2, the full-length cDNA of 467 base pairs was obtained. Comparison of the cDNA sequence with the genomic sequence (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number AC005102) defines the exon-intron junctions: exon 1, positions 95,006–95,105; exon 2, positions 95,206–95,320; and exon 3, positions 97,420–97,670. The cDNA contained a long open reading frame starting from the first methionine codon and encoding a highly basic polypeptide of 94 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 10,635 Da. The 3′-noncoding region contains a typical AATAAA polyadenylation signal, but no ATTTA motif for rapid mRNA degradation, which is frequently found in the 3′-noncoding regions of cytokines and chemokines (21Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar). The deduced polypeptide sequence contains a highly hydrophobic amino-terminal region characteristic of a signal peptide with a predicted cleavage site between Ala-23 and Thr-24. The predicted mature protein of 71 amino acids has a molecular mass of 8,386 Da and an isoelectric point of 10.86. There is no potential N-glycosylation site. The mature protein is a CC chemokine with four cysteine residues in the proper arrangement. The amino acid identities of the mature protein to other known human CC chemokines are ranged from 45% with MIP-1β to 22% with LARC. We also constructed a phylogenetic tree using the mature amino acid sequences of all the known human CC chemokines (Fig.3). Even though the amino acid identity of the novel chemokine (indicated as eotaxin-3) to MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 is only 33%, it has the closest relationship with MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 and is located just at the branching point between the CC chemokines clustered on chromosome 17q11.2 and those mapped mostly to different chromosomal loci. Because of its close evolutionary and genetic relationship to MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 and its specific activity on CCR3 (see below), we termed this novel chemokine eotaxin-3.Figure 3Phylogenetic tree of the human CC chemokines. Evolutionary distances are estimated using the program phylp (23Gotoh O. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1995; 11: 543-551PubMed Google Scholar) based on the protein alignment data generated by the program prrp (23Gotoh O. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1995; 11: 543-551PubMed Google Scholar). The chromosome where each chemokine gene is mapped is indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined constitutive expression of eotaxin-3 mRNA in various human tissues by Northern blot analysis. Eotaxin-3 transcripts of ∼0.8 kilobases were detected at low levels in the heart and ovary (Fig.4). By reverse transcription-PCR, however, its transcripts were detected ubiquitously in various tissues (data not shown). To obtain recombinant eotaxin-3, insect cells were infected with a recombinant baculovirus encoding eotaxin-3 under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. Recombinant eotaxin-3 was purified from pooled culture supernatants by cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Eotaxin-3 was eluted from the reverse-phase column as a single major peak at an acetonitrile concentration of 30% (Fig.5 A) and migrated as a single band of ∼12 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 5 B). Amino acid sequence analysis demonstrated that the amino terminus of mature eotaxin-3 starts at Thr-24 as predicted. To examine the interaction of eotaxin-3 with each cloned receptor, we measured eotaxin-3-induced calcium mobilization in a panel of L1.2 cells stably expressing CCR1–7, CX3CR1, CXCR5,XCR1, CCR9, GPR1, GPR15/BOB, GPR25, STRL33/BONZO, Mas, and CMKR-L2 (16Yoshida R. Nagira M. Kitaura M. Imagawa N. Imai T. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7118-7122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, eotaxin-3 induced calcium flux specifically in CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells. On the other hand, MIP-1α, MCP-1, TARC, RANTES, LARC, and SLC properly induced calcium flux in L1.2 cells expressing their respective receptors even after treatment with eotaxin-3. As shown in Fig.7, eotaxin and eotaxin-3 induced calcium mobilization in CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with EC50 values of ∼0.4 and ∼3 nm, respectively. These results demonstrate that eotaxin-3 is a specific functional ligand for CCR3, but has a potency about one-tenth of that of eotaxin.Figure 7Dose-response curves of calcium mobilization in CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells. Murine L1.2 pre-B cells stably transfected with CCR3 were loaded with Fura-2/AM and stimulated with the indicated concentrations of eotaxin (▴) or eotaxin-3 (●). The means ± S.E. from three separate experiments are plotted as percent maximum response to eotaxin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells, we analyzed cross-desensitization between eotaxin-3 and other known CCR3 ligands: eotaxin, eotaxin-2, MCP-4, and RANTES. As shown in Fig. 8, eotaxin-3 desensitized the cells almost completely to eotaxin-3, eotaxin-2, and RANTES and partially to eotaxin and MCP-4. Conversely, eotaxin and MCP-4 almost completely desensitized the cells to eotaxin-3, whereas RANTES and eotaxin-2 only partially desensitized the cells to eotaxin-3. Thus, the rank order of potency for calcium mobilization in CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells between eotaxin-3 and these other CCR3 ligands is as follows: eotaxin, MCP-4 > eotaxin-3 > eotaxin-2, RANTES. To compare the binding affinity of eotaxin and eotaxin-3 with that of CCR3, we carried out a displacement-type binding experiment in which binding of 125I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells was competed by unlabeled competitors. As shown in Fig. 9, both eotaxin and eotaxin-3 showed complete competition with IC50 values of 1.9 and 13 nm, respectively. We examined the chemotactic activity of eotaxin-3 in comparison with eotaxin. As shown in Fig.10, eotaxin induced chemotactic responses in eosinophils with a typical bell-shaped dose-response curve and a maximum effect at 100 nm. On the other hand, eotaxin-3 induced migration of eosinophils only at 1000 nm. Similarly, eotaxin induced migration of basophils at 30–300 nm, whereas eotaxin-3 induced migration of basophils only at 300 nm. In the past few years, a number of novel chemokines, particularly CC chemokines, have been discovered by searching the public and private expressed sequence tag data bases. Some of the chemokines are of particular interest because of their constitutive expression in lymphoid tissues, their specific activities on lymphocytes and dendritic cells, and their genes being mapped to chromosomal sites different from the major chemokine gene clusters at chromosome 4 and 17 (3Yoshie O. Imai T. Nomiyama H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 634-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Even though the expressed sequence tag data bases have been quite useful for identification of many new chemokines, those that are expressed in small amounts in tissues or by a restricted type of cells may be rarely represented in expressed sequence tag data bases. Since chemokine genes tend to be clustered, it may also be possible to discover novel chemokines at chromosomal loci where some chemokines are already mapped. Previously, we mapped the novel CC chemokine MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 to chromosome 7q11.23 (14Nomiyama H. Osborne L.R. Imai T. Kusuda J. Miura R. Tsui L.-C. Yoshie O. Genomics. 1998; 49: 339-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the present study, by analyzing the genomic sequence containing MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (H_RG356E01.seq/AC005102), we have indeed identified a novel human CC chemokine termed eotaxin-3 (Fig. 2) in the vicinity of MPIF-2/eotaxin-2. The genes for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (SCYA24) and eotaxin-3 (SCYA26) are localized within a region of ∼40 kilobases and thus represent a new cluster of chemokine genes at chromosome 7q11.23 (Fig. 1). It is thus likely that MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3 were generated by gene duplication from a common ancestor. In a phylogenetic tree, they are indeed most closely related to each other even though they also appear to have diversified a long time ago (Fig. 3). Notably, the CC chemokines of the major chemokine cluster at chromosome 17 appear to be mostly generated after diversification of eotaxin-3 from a common ancestor (Fig. 3). We have shown that eotaxin-3 is capable of inducing transient calcium mobilization specifically in CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells (Fig. 6). Eotaxin and eotaxin-3 induced transient calcium mobilization in CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with EC50 values of 0.4 and 3 nm, respectively (Fig. 7). Eotaxin-3 partially desensitized CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells to eotaxin and MCP-4 and completely desensitized these cells to eotaxin-2 and RANTES (Fig. 8). Eotaxin and eotaxin-3 competed the binding of 125I-eotaxin to CCR3-expressing L1.2 cells with IC50 values of 1.9 and 13 nm, respectively (Fig. 9). Collectively, eotaxin-3 is yet another functional ligand for CCR3. The potency of eotaxin-3 as a CCR3 ligand seems, however, to be ∼10-fold less than that of eotaxin (Fig.7). Consistently, eotaxin-3 was chemotactic for normal peripheral blood eosinophils and basophils only at high concentrations (Fig. 10). However, eotaxin-3 may have more relevant biological functions such as myeloid progenitor inhibition shown for MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 (12Patel V.P. Kreider P.L. Li Y. Li H. Keung K. Salcedo T. Nardelli B. Pippalla V. Gentz S. Thotakura R. Parmelee D. Gentz R. Garotta G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Eotaxin-3 may also act on an unknown receptor different from CCR3 with a higher potency. Northern blot analysis has shown that eotaxin-3 mRNA is constitutively expressed in the heart and ovary (Fig. 4). By reverse transcription-PCR, however, its mRNA is detected ubiquitously in various tissues (data not shown). This may indicate that eotaxin-3 is expressed ubiquitously at low levels by cells in various tissues or by only a minor fraction of cells present in various tissues. Previously, MPIF-2/eotaxin-2 mRNA could not be detected in any human tissues by Northern blot analysis (12Patel V.P. Kreider P.L. Li Y. Li H. Keung K. Salcedo T. Nardelli B. Pippalla V. Gentz S. Thotakura R. Parmelee D. Gentz R. Garotta G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The transcripts were detected only by reverse transcription-PCR in monocytes treated with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and in T cells activated by anti-CD3 antibody in the presence of interleukin-2 (12Patel V.P. Kreider P.L. Li Y. Li H. Keung K. Salcedo T. Nardelli B. Pippalla V. Gentz S. Thotakura R. Parmelee D. Gentz R. Garotta G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen which types of cells produce eotaxin-3 and whether production of eotaxin-3 is up-regulated by some external stimuli. It is also notable that, like eotaxin-3, eotaxin is constitutively expressed in the heart, in addition to the small intestine and colon (6Kitaura M. Nakajima T. Imai T. Harada S. Combadiere C. Tiffany H.L. Murphy P.M. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7725-7730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Eosinophils are known to migrate physiologically into intestinal tissues, but do not usually exist in heart tissues except for rare complications associated with high blood eosinophilia (22Fauci A.S. Harley J.B. Roberts W.C. Ferrans V.J. Gralnick H.R. Bjornson B.H. Ann. Intern. Med. 1982; 97: 78-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, eotaxin and eotaxin-3 may have some other physiological roles in the heart. By its low potency on CCR3, eotaxin-3 may even negatively regulate migration of eosinophils into the heart. In conclusion, identification of eotaxin-3 will further promote our understanding of eosinophil trafficking and other CCR3-mediated pathophysiological phenomena. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether eotaxin-3 has functions other than that of a low potency ligand for CCR3. The strategy of identification of eotaxin-3 used in this study may also be applicable to identification of other unknown chemokines. We are grateful to Drs. Yorio Hinuma, Masakazu Hatanaka, and Retsu Miura for constant support and encouragement."
https://openalex.org/W2004608386,"A 22-kilodalton protein was isolated from the submandibular (mental) gland of the male terrestrial salamander, Plethodon jordani (family: Plethodontidae). This proteinaceous pheromone, termed plethodontid receptivity factor (PRF), was experimentally delivered to the female during courtship and shown to increase female receptivity. In most plethodontid salamanders, ovulation occurs weeks or months after insemination, so the pheromone-induced change in receptivity is the only known function of PRF. The messenger RNAs corresponding to isoforms of PRF were transcribed into complementary DNA, cloned, sequenced, and shown to have homology with cytokines of the interleukin-6 family. Pheromone activity would represent a previously unrecognized function for cytokines."

HSF4 is a mammalian factor characterized by its lack of a suppression domain that modulates formation of DNA-binding homotrimer. Here, we have determined the exon structure of the human HSF4 gene and identified a major new isoform, HSF4b, derived by alternative RNA splicing events, in addition to a previously reported HSF4a isoform. In mouse tissues HSF4b mRNA was more abundant than HSF4a as examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and its protein was detected in the brain and lung. Although both mouse HSF4a and HSF4b form trimers in the absence of stress, these two isoforms exhibit different transcriptional activity; HSF4a acts as an inhibitor of the constitutive expression of heat shock genes, and hHSF4b acts as a transcriptional activator. Furthermore HSF4b but not HSF4a complements the viability defect of yeast cells lacking HSF. Moreover, heat shock and other stresses stimulate transcription of target genes by HSF4b in both yeast and mammalian cells. These results suggest that differential splicing of HSF4 mRNA gives rise to both an inhibitor and activator of tissue-specific heat shock gene expression.

These results suggest that differential splicing of HSF4 mRNA gives rise to both an inhibitor and activator of tissue-specific heat shock gene expression. In response to heat shock, all organisms induce a set of proteins known as heat shock proteins (Hsps) 1The abbreviations used are:Hspheat shock proteinHSFheat shock transcription factorGSTglutathioneS-transferaseRTreverse transcriptionPCRpolymerase chain reactionHSEheat shock elementhHSF4human HSF4DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFCSfetal calf serumHAhemagglutinin epitopeDBDDNA-binding domainLUCluciferaseEGSethylene glycol bis-(succinimidylsuccinate)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to protect themselves from cell death. Hsps are abundantly expressed in most organisms even under normal growth conditions and cooperatively act as molecular chaperones to facilitate many cellular processes including protein synthesis, folding and assembly, translocation, degradation, and the regulation of kinases and transcription factors (1Bukau B.

The expression of Hsps is tightly controlled by changes in metabolic processes in cells such as cell cycle progression, differentiation, development, neuroendocrinological stress, infection, trauma, exercise, and the expression of oncoproteins and by stresses that cause protein denaturation such as heat shock, oxidative stress, and exposure to heavy metals and anti-cancer drugs (5Morimoro R.I.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref Scopus (982) Google Scholar). In contrast to the single HSF gene in yeast and fruit fly, four HSF genes (HSF1,HSF2, HSF3, and HSF4) have been isolated in vertebrates, and biochemical features of HSF1, HSF2, and HSF3 have been established (7Morimoto R.I.

HSF1 is the major factor that is activated by heat shock and by exposure to other environmental or physiological stresses (9Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 10Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Mouse cells deficient for HSF1 are viable but are defective in the induction of heat shock genes (11McMillan D.R. Xiao X. Shao L. Graves K. Benjamin I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7523-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). HSF2 is not activated by these stresses (12Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I.

Disruption of the HSF3 gene markedly suppresses the induction of heat shock genes even in the presence of HSF1 in chicken B lymphocyte DT40 cells (18Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Takeda S. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Nakai A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The heat shock factors HSF1–3 are localized primarily in the cytoplasm as inert forms in normally growing cells (9Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell.

In the absence of exogenous stress, HSF1 remains a monomer, whereas HSF2 and HSF3 are dimers in cultured cells; the precise nature of these complexes is not completely characterized (9Baler R.

When cells are exposed to heat shock, each HSF relocalizes to the nucleus and is converted to a homotrimer that can bind to HSEs with high affinity (9Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar,10Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 16Nakai A.

These changes in intracellular localization and oligomer formation are controlled mainly by twocis-regulatory domains HR-A/B and HR-C, which are composed of heptad repeats of hydrophobic amino acids (22Nakai A. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1983-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 23Orosz A. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Mol. Cell.

In unstressed cells, all of these heptad repeats appear to be involved in the stabilization of a monomer or dimer form, because mutation of specific amino acids in these heptad repeats causes constitutive trimer formation (22Nakai A.

Nelson H.C. Cell. 1989; 59: 807-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Heat and oxidative stress can directly cause HSF1 trimer formation in vitro; however, regulatory factors modulate the monomer- or dimer-to-trimer transition of HSF in vivo (28Goodson M.L. Sarge K.D.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6552-6560Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The acquisition of HSE binding activity by trimer formation is not sufficient to induce the expression of heat shock genes (36Hensold J.O. Hunt C.R. Calderwood S.K. Housman D.E. Kingston R.E. Mol.

Science. 1992; 255: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In fact, the overexpression of HSF1 or HSF3 in cells causes a trimer form that can bind to HSEs (Ref. 10Sarge K.D.

Nakai, unpublished results. The transactivation domain of HSF1 is located near the carboxyl terminus and is repressed by a central cis-regulatory domain under nonstress conditions (39Green M.

This regulatory domain is phosphorylated by MAPK/ERK kinase under normal conditions, and mutation of the phosphorylation site abolishes this suppression of the activation domain in the absence of stress (43Chu B.

This suppression may be alleviated by heat shock and other stresses through phosphorylation or dephosphorylation (47Cotto J.J. Kline M. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3355-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 48Xia W. Guo Y. Vilaboa N. Zuo J. Voellmy R. J. Biol.

Mosser D. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Although much information has been obtained regarding the mechanism of the activation of heat shock genes, few studies have examined the mechanisms controlling the cell-specific constitutive expression of heat shock genes or the mechanisms underlying the suppression of heat shock gene expression. We recently isolated a novel cDNA coding for human HSF4 (hHSF4) (51Nakai A. Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). hHSF4 does not have the HR-C domain that is necessary for the suppression of trimer formation, suggesting that hHSF4 exists as a trimer that can bind to HSEs without stress. In addition, hHSF4 does not have the potential to activate transcription, as shown by reporter gene analysis in transfection experiments. Actually, the overexpression of hHSF4 in HeLa cells suppressed the expression of heat shock genes in normally growing cells (51Nakai A. Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that hHSF4 may play a role in modulating the constitutive expression of heat shock genes. In the present study, we have extended these observations by characterizing endogenously expressed mouse HSF4 and found the existence of a major splicing isoform of HSF4, HSF4b, that positively regulates heat shock gene expression. A λFIXII library of human placenta DNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) was screened by hybridization using a 32P-labeled insert of phHSF4–7a (51Nakai A. Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I.

The filters were rinsed four times with 2× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.015 m sodium citrate)-0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min per rinse, washed twice in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 30 min, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Six positive clones were isolated, and the clone D has all exons corresponding to the open reading frame of phHSF4–7a. After appropriate XbaI digestion fragments were identified by Southern blotting using a 5′- or 3′-terminal cDNA fragment, they were subcloned into pGEM7 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Sequencing reactions were performed by using an AutoRead sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with synthetic oligonucleotides and Fluore-dATP labeling mix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequences were analyzed by using ALF express DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and assembled with GeneWorks (IntelliGenetics, Inc., Campbell, CA). A λgt11 library of mouse brain cDNA was screened by hybridization using a32P-labeled insert of phHSF4–7a as described above. Clones were subcloned into pGEM7 vector, and one clone, pmHSF4b-1, was sequenced in both directions. The insert of pmHSF4b-1 (1653 base pairs) lacked 28 base pairs from the putative translation start site. To isolate the 5′ terminus of mouse HSF4 cDNA, we performed PCR for rapid amplification of cDNA ends using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). We used Marathon-Ready cDNA from mouse brain (CLONTECH) as a template. The amplified products were subcloned into pCR II vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen, NV Leek, Netherlands), and the longest clone was sequenced, yielding a 1686-base pair clone containing the mouse HSF4b cDNA. The sequences obtained were confirmed by the sequences of the genomic clones isolated from the λFIXII library of mouse 129 Svj (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Total RNAs from human tissues were purchased (CLONTECH) or isolated by the acid guanidium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (52Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) from tissues surgically dissected after informed consent. RT-PCR was performed essentially as described previously (53Foley K.P. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 730-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Total RNA was reverse transcribed at 42 °C using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and oligo(dT) (pd(T)12–18; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or random hexanucleotides (pd(N)6; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The reaction mixture contained 2 μg of total RNA, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dNTP, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 μg of pd(T)12–18, and 2.5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase in a final volume of 20 μl. PCR was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl with 2 μl of cDNA synthesis mixture, primers at 1 μm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, 200 mm each dNTP, and 2.5 units of GeneTaq (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) for 40 cycles of 94 °C denaturing (1 min), 65 °C annealing (2 min), and 72 °C extension (3 min) in an automated thermal cycler (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). 10 μl of each reaction mixture was electorophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, and Southern blotting was performed using a32P-labeled insert of phHSF4–7a. The oligonucleotide primers used to examine the alternative splicing events shown in Fig. 1were as follows: a, 5′-CAG GAA GCG CCA GCT GCG-3′; b, 5′-TCG GTG CTC TCC TGC ACT-3′; c, 5′-AGT GCA GGA GAG CAC CGA G-3′; d, 5′-TGA AGC AGC ATC GGA GGC AGC-3′; e, 5′-TGC CTC CGA TGC TGC TTC-3′; f, 5′-GTT CCA AGC CCC TTC AGA-3′. The existence of isoforms in mouse tissues was examined as described above using a set of mouse specific primers: m4–448, 5′-GAG TGC AGG AGA GCA CGG-3′; m4–1061, 5′-TGG TTC AGG CTG TTG TAC-3′ or a set of common primers for mouse and human cDNA: mh4c, 5′-CAG AAC GAG ATC TTG TGG C-3′; mh4d, 5′-AGC AGA CTC TCT GGG CTC-3′. A 102-base pair fragment of S16 ribosomal protein mRNA was amplified and stained with ethidium bromide as a control (53Foley K.P. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 730-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To determine the sequences of the amplified products, PCR reaction mixtures were fractionated on low melting agarose gel. The appropriate band was cut out and subcloned into the pCR II vector (Invitrogen). Sequencing reaction was performed using M13 reverse and forward primers as described above. COS7 cells, HeLa cells, mouse myoblast C2C12 cells (a gift from Dr. H. M. Blau) (54Chiu C.-P. Blau H.M. Cell. 1984; 37: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), mouse 3T3-L1 cells, and mouse embryonic carcinoma F9 cells were all maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells were maintained in DMEM/Ham's F-12 (1:1) containing 10% FCS. NCB20 neuroblastoma-brain hybrid cells were maintained in DMEM containing 1× HAT (hypoxanthin, aminopterin, and thymidine) supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% FCS, and cells were induced to differentiate by changing the medium to DMEM containing 1× HAT, 1% FCS, and 1 mm dibutyryl cAMP (55Nirenberg M. Wilson S. Higashida H. Rotter A. Krueger K. Busis N. Ray R. Kenimer J.G. Adler M. Science. 1983; 222: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 5% FCS and 5% horse serum and differentiated on collagen-coated dishes in the presence of 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (2.5 S) (Life Technologies, Inc.). For creating antiserum to mouse HSF4, a pGEX2T-mHSF4CT plasmid was constructed that encoded the carboxyl-terminal region of mHSF4 (amino acids 395–492) fused to the GST protein. GST-mHSF4CT protein was electroeluted from the gel and was used as the rabbit immunogen to obtain a specific antiserum for hHSF4 (anti-mHSF4t) as described previously (51Nakai A. Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). An anti-mHSF4t serum recognizes a recombinant mouse HSF4 protein much stronger than antiserum raised against human HSF4 (anti-hHSF4b) (51Nakai A. Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To examine the tissue-specific expression of mHSF4, tissues were dissected from adult BDF1 mice and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were homogenized in five volumes of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.42m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml of pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 0.5 mm of dithiothreitol) by using a Polytron homogenizer, and the protein concentration of each extract was determined by using the Bradford dye reagent (Bio-Rad). Western blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (16Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5168-5178Google Scholar) using an anti-mHSF4t serum (1:500 dilution), and polypeptides were detected by using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To confirm the specific bands for mouse HSF4 protein, nitrocellulose membranes containing 60 μg of whole cell extracts were soaked for 1 h at room temperature in 1 ml of 2% dry milk/phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 μl of anti-mHSF4t serum with 5 μg of recombinant GST-mHSF4CT as a competitor or GST-cHSF1 (16Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5168-5178Google Scholar) as a control. For the detection of hHSF4a and hHSF4b expressed in yeast cells, the 12CA5 mouse monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to detect hemagglutinin HA-tagged hHSF4a and hHSF4b. Whole cell extracts were applied on a Superdex 200 HR column with a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (16Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5168-5178Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation was performed as described (16Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5168-5178Google Scholar), and equal volumes of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (51Nakai A. Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To compare the levels of HSF4 mRNA in various mouse tissues, RNA blots containing 2 μg each of poly(A)+ RNA from various mouse tissues (MTN blot purchased from CLONTECH) were hybridized with a 1.65-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment of pmHSF4–1 and a human β-actin cDNA fragment (CLONTECH). The expression plasmids pGAL4-hHSF4b (amino acids 200–493) and pGAL4-hHSF1 (amino acids 204–529) were generated as described previously (51Nakai A. Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). COS7 cells maintained in 100-mm Petri dishes were transfected with 10 μg of pCMV-GAL4, pGAL4-hHSF4a, pGAL4-hHSF4b, or pGAL4-hHSF, 5 μg of a reporter plasmid (ptk-gal3-luc), and 0.5 μg of an internal control vector, pCDM8-LacZ (a kind gift from Dr. J. Fujita, Kyoto University) by the calcium phosphate transfection method. At 6 h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated further for 24 h in normal medium. A luciferase assay was performed exactly as described previously (16Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5168-5178Google Scholar), and the transfection efficiencies were normalized by β-galactosidase activity. For the β-galactosidase assay, aliquots of transfected cells were suspended in 100 μl of 0.25m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After the cell suspension was frozen and thawed three times and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min (MX-150, Tomy, Tokyo, Japan), 30 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 66 μl of O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactosidase (4 mg/ml in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) and 204 μl of Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of 1 m sodium carbonate, and the absorption at 420 nm was measured (Ultraspec 3000; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The human HSF4b expression vector pCMV-hHSF4b was generated by subcloning theEcoRI fragment of hHSF4b cDNA, containing the entire hHSF4 open reading frame, into pCMV/Blue vector (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). HeLa cells maintained in 100-mm Petri dishes were cotransfected with 30 μg of pCMV-hHSF4b and 5 μg of pHβ-Act-neo vector (16Nakai A. Kawazoe Y. Tanabe M. Nagata K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5168-5178Google Scholar) for 4 h by the calcium phosphate transfection method. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were shocked with 1.5% glycerol for 2 min and incubated in normal medium for 24 h. Stable transformants were then selected in the presence of Geneticin disulfide (Wako) at a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. Human cDNAs encoding HSF4a and HSF4b were subcloned into the yeast expression vectors p424GPD and p423GPD (56Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar), respectively. p424PGPD-hHSF4aHA and p423GPD-hHSF4bHA were generated by the insertion of a triple influenza HA tag immediately upstream of the stop codon in each of the cDNAs. Other yeast plasmids, yeast strains, growth conditions, cell extract preparation, cross-linking, and acquired thermotolerance assays were conducted as described (57Liu X.-D. Liu P.C.C. Santoro N. Thiele D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6466-6477Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). RNase protection assay was performed as described (57Liu X.-D. Liu P.C.C. Santoro N. Thiele D.J.

In the course of the molecular cloning of human HSF4, we isolated some partial cDNAs whose sequences did not completely match that of the reported clone phHSF4–7a (51Nakai A. Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1998749797,"A series of carefully controlled laboratory studies was carried out to investigate oxygen and iron isotope fractionation during the intracellular production of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) by two different species of magnetotactic bacteria at temperatures between 4° and 35°C under microaerobic and anaerobic conditions. No detectable fractionation of iron isotopes in the bacterial magnetites was observed. However, oxygen isotope measurements indicated a temperature-dependent fractionation for Fe 3 O 4 and water that is consistent with that observed for Fe 3 O 4 produced extracellularly by thermophilic Fe 3+ -reducing bacteria. These results contrast with established fractionation curves estimated from either high-temperature experiments or theoretical calculations. With the fractionation curve established in this report, oxygen-18 isotope values of bacterial Fe 3 O 4 may be useful in paleoenvironmental studies for determining the oxygen-18 isotope values of formation waters and for inferring paleotemperatures."

Here, we have characterized the smooth muscle sarcoglycan complex. By examination of embryonic muscle lineages and biochemical fractionation studies, we demonstrated that ε-sarcoglycan is an integral component of the smooth muscle sarcoglycan complex along with β- and δ-sarcoglycan. Analysis of genetically defined animal models for muscular dystrophy supported this conclusion. The δ-sarcoglycan-deficient cardiomyopathic hamster and mice deficient in both dystrophin and utrophin showed loss of the smooth muscle sarcoglycan complex, whereas the complex was unaffected in α-sarcoglycan null mice in agreement with the finding that α-sarcoglycan is not expressed in smooth muscle cells. In the cardiomyopathic hamster, the smooth muscle sarcoglycan complex, containing ε-sarcoglycan, was fully restored following intramuscular injection of recombinant δ-sarcoglycan adenovirus. Together, these results demonstrate a tissue-dependent variation in the sarcoglycan complex and show that ε-sarcoglycan replaces α-sarcoglycan as an integral component of the smooth muscle dystrophin-glycoprotein complex.

Dystrophin binds to cytoskeletal actin and to a transmembrane protein, β-dystroglycan; the extracellular domain of β-dystroglycan binds to the peripheral membrane protein, α-dystroglycan; and α-dystroglycan binds to laminin α2 in the basal lamina (8Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). In this way, the DGC serves as a link between the extracellular matrix and the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. The essential role of the DGC is emphasized by findings that mutations of genes encoding dystrophin, all four sarcoglycans, and the laminin α2 chain underlie muscular dystrophies in recently described experimental animals (9Hack A.A.

Interestingly, dysphagia, vomiting, chronic constipation, increased gastric emptying time, and acute digestive dilatations, all potentially due to malfunctions of digestive smooth muscle, have been reported in patients with progressive muscular dystrophy (15Barohn R.J.

Furthermore, fibrosis and atrophy of the gastrointestinal smooth muscle has been repeatedly described in autopsies of dystrophin-deficient humans (15Barohn R.J. Levine E.J. Olson J.O. Mendell J.R. N.

Thus, clinical observations raise the possibility that the DGC plays an important role in smooth muscle. It has been infeasible to investigate this possibility, however, because the presence of a DGC in smooth muscle has not yet been directly demonstrated. Accordingly, we have used several approaches to identify and analyze DGC components of smooth muscle. The starting point for our study was the recent identification of ε-sarcoglycan, a transmembrane glycoprotein showing 43% amino acid identity with α-sarcoglycan (19McNally E.M. Ly C.T. Kunkel L.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 20Ettinger A.J. Feng G. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32534-32538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In striated (skeletal and cardiac) muscle fibers, α-sarcoglycan is associated with three other sarcoglycans (β, γ, and δ), forming a subcomplex within the DGC (21Jung D. Duclos F. Apostol B. Straub V. Lee J.C. Allamand V. Venzke D.P. Sunada Y. Moomaw C.R. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Crawford T.O. McPherson J.D. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The sarcoglycan subcomplex may strengthen the binding of dystroglycan and dystrophin to the sarcolemma, thereby stabilizing the link between the inside and the outside of the cell (23Holt K.H.

However, whereas the expression of α-sarcoglycan is restricted to striated muscle cells (24Roberds S.L. Anderson R.D. Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23739-23742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Yamamoto H. Mizuno Y. Hayashi K. Nonaka I. Yoshida M. Ozawa E. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 115: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), ε-sarcoglycan is broadly expressed (19McNally E.M. Ly C.T. Kunkel L.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 20Ettinger A.J. Feng G. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32534-32538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that ε-sarcoglycan might replace α-sarcoglycan in smooth muscle. Here, we have used biochemical and genetic methods to test that hypothesis. We show that a DGC can be purified from smooth muscle and that ε-sarcoglycan is an integral component of the smooth muscle DGC. Together with β- and δ-sarcoglycans, it is enriched in purified smooth muscle DGC. We further show that α- and γ-sarcoglycans are not integral components of the smooth muscle DGC. Moreover, mice deficient in both dystrophin and its autosomal homologue, utrophin, and hamsters deficient in δ-sarcoglycan showed loss of the smooth muscle sarcoglycan complex. In contrast, the smooth muscle complex was unaffected in α-sarcoglycan null mice. In summary, these results demonstrate that smooth muscle cells are similar to striated muscle fibers in that they contain a DGC, but differ in the composition of the complex. Our results also provide molecular bases for functional studies of the smooth muscle DGC and for clinical investigations of smooth muscle malfunctions in diverse muscular dystrophies.

For smooth muscle staining, tissues were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. mounting medium (Miles, Inc., Elkhart, IN), and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. Immunofluorescence microscopy of 7-μm cryosections was performed as described (10Duclos F. Straub V. Moore S.A. Venzke D.P. Hrstka R.F. Crosbie R.H. Durbeej M. Lebakken C.S.

Briefly, sections were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 30 min, and then incubated with the primary antibodies for 90 min in 1% BSA/PBS. After washing with 1% BSA/PBS, sections were incubated with CY3-, fluorescein-, rhodamine-, or biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min, then washed with 1% BSA/PBS. If necessary, slides were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000) for 30 min. After a rinse with PBS, sections were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Sections were observed under a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) or a MRC-600 laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). KCl-washed membranes from skeletal muscle were prepared as described previously (31Ohlendieck K. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1685-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Rabbit skeletal muscle DGC was extracted with 1% digitonin from KCl-washed membranes and then purified by succinyl wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange on a DEAE column, as described (32Ervasti J.M.

Smooth muscle DGC was extracted from rabbit visceral smooth muscle, as described below, with 1% digitonin and then purified by WGA affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange on a DEAE column. Proteins from the DEAE eluate were separated by SDS-PAGE on 3–15% linear gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblot staining was performed as described previously (33Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Gaver M.G. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The muscularis propria was prepared from rabbit pylorus muscle. Smooth muscle DGC was extracted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl containing 1% digitonin (Sigma) with a mixture of protease inhibitors. The extracted proteins were circulated overnight on a WGA-agarose column (Vector Laboratories). The columns were washed with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl containing 0.1% digitonin and eluted with 0.3 m N-acetylglucosamine in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl containing 0.1% digitonin. The WGA eluate was incubated with Protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h, to remove contamination of immunoglobulins. The supernatant after Protein G incubation was diluted to 100 mm NaCl with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% digitonin and applied to a DEAE-cellulose column and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl containing 0.1% digitonin. The column was eluted with a gradient of 100 mm-300 mmNaCl buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% digitonin. The fractions containing DGC were pooled and concentrated to 800 μl. The samples were applied to a 5–30% sucrose gradient and centrifuged with a Beckman VTi65.1 vertical rotor (Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA) at 200,000 × g for 150 min at 4 °C. The gradient was fractionated into 1-ml fractions, which were blotted as described previously (33Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Gaver M.G. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). A human δ-sarcoglycan expression construct was prepared as previously described (23Holt K.H. Lim L.E. Straub V. Venzke D.P.

Hamsters were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) at a calculated dose of 75 mg/kg. The abdominal wall overlying the bladder was disinfected, and a 1-cm vertical incision was made. The bladder was exposed, and 109 viral particles in 100 μl of normal saline were injected into the bladder wall of 3-month-old BIO 14.6 hamsters. The incision was closed with 3–4 sutures. Hamsters recovered with continual supervision and were housed postoperatively at the University of Iowa Animal Care Facility. Five, 10, and 14 days after injection, hamsters were killed by CO2 asphyxiation. Injected bladders were removed by dissection, embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Miles Inc.), and quickly frozen in liquid N2-cooled isopentane. A common feature of all sarcoglycans, including ε-sarcoglycan, is their sarcolemmal expression. Previous studies have demonstrated differential expression of sarcoglycans in non-muscle tissues: α- and γ-sarcoglycan are expressed exclusively in skeletal and cardiac muscle (25Yamamoto H. Mizuno Y. Hayashi K. Nonaka I. Yoshida M. Ozawa E. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 115: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); β- and δ-sarcoglycan are selectively expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, but are also detectable in other tissues (21Jung D.

McNally E.M. Duggan D.J. Angelini C. Hoffman E.P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar); and ε-sarcoglycan is widely expressed (19McNally E.M. Ly C.T. Kunkel L.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 20Ettinger A.J. Feng G. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32534-32538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We began the present study by asking how these differences arise, focusing on the three muscle lineages: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth. To this end, we stained sections from staged embryonic and postnatal mice with antibodies specific for three sarcoglycans that are differentially distributed in adults: α-, β-, and ε-sarcoglycan. ε-Sarcoglycan was detectable in embryos by E8.5; the earliest age examined (data not shown) and was broadly distributed by E12. ε-Sarcoglycan-positive cells included myoblasts or myotubes in forming axial muscle, myocytes in heart, prospective smooth muscle surrounding bronchi in lung, and vascular endothelium throughout the embryo (Fig. 1, c,l, u, and v). In contrast, neither α- nor β-sarcoglycan was detectable in any tissue at E8.5-E12 (Fig.1, a, b, j, k,s, and t). Thus, expression of ε-sarcoglycan precedes that of α- and β-sarcoglycans. ε-Sarcoglycan remained widely distributed at E15. It was abundant in smooth muscle of the lung and bronchus, in skeletal myotubes and cardiac myocytes, and in a variety of endodermal and ectodermal derivatives (Fig. 1, f, o, y,z, e′, and f′). α- and β-sarcoglycan were also present at this stage, but their distribution was sharply restricted to skeletal and cardiac muscle (Fig. 1,d, e, m, n, w, and x; data not shown). At this stage, therefore, muscles of different sublineages become distinguishable by the complement of sarcoglycans they express. This difference between striated muscle and other tissues is maintained and accentuated as development proceeds; levels of α- and β-sarcoglycan increase in skeletal and cardiac muscle, but neither sarcoglycan is detectable in smooth muscle or non-muscle tissues (Fig.1, g, h,p, and q; data not shown). In contrast, levels of ε-sarcoglycan remain high in smooth muscle and vascular endothelium but decline perceptibly in skeletal and cardiac muscle (Fig.1,i, r, g′, and h′). Thus, by birth, α- and β-sarcoglycan appear to be more abundant than ε-sarcoglycan in skeletal muscle, and at least as abundant as ε-sarcoglycan in cardiac muscle. Patterns on sarcoglycan expression do not change appreciably in skeletal or cardiac muscle postnatally (see below). In smooth muscles, however, an additional change in the complement of sarcoglycans occurs after birth; although ε-sarcoglycan is abundant in and α-sarcoglycan is absent from smooth muscles throughout development (Fig. 1, a′, c′, d′, i′, and j′), β-sarcoglycan appears in this muscle lineage during the postnatal period. In bronchiolar smooth muscle, for example, β-sarcoglycan appears during the first postnatal week (Fig.1 b′). To determine whether ε-sarcoglycan replaces α-sarcoglycan in smooth muscle cells and is associated with the sarcoglycan complex, we investigated the expression of ε-sarcoglycan and the sarcoglycans in several adult smooth muscle-containing tissues, including the esophagus. In contrast to humans, the muscularis propria of the esophagus in mice consists of skeletal muscle fibers throughout the entire length of the tube and only contains scattered smooth muscle cells in its distal part (36Patapoutian A. Wold B.J. Wagner R.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1818-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). On transverse sections of the esophagus, one can therefore study protein expression in smooth muscle cells of the muscularis mucosa and skeletal muscle fibers of the muscularis propria side by side. Immunofluorescence staining of ε-sarcoglycan was stronger at the plasma membrane of smooth muscle cells than in striated muscle fibers (Fig.2 B). In control animals, ε-sarcoglycan was expressed in smooth muscle cells of the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 2 B), the bladder, the lung, and the uterus (data not shown). Testing antibodies against the sarcoglycan complex in smooth muscle cells, we found coexpression of β- and δ-sarcoglycan with ε-sarcoglycan in all investigated tissues (Fig.2 B and data not shown). In contrast to striated muscle, α- and γ-sarcoglycan were not expressed at the plasma membrane of smooth muscle cells (Fig. 2 B). Using antibodies against other components of the DGC, we found expression of sarcospan, dystrophin, and α- and β-dystroglycan in smooth muscle cells of control animals (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). Next, we tested whether ε-sarcoglycan is a component of the isolated sarcoglycan complex from smooth muscle cells. The DGC was extracted from rabbit visceral smooth muscle by digitonin and further purified by WGA affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange on a DEAE-column. Proteins from the DEAE eluate were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the resultant polyacrylamide gels were immunoblotted with anti-sarcoglycan antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, ε-sarcoglycan co-purified with the smooth muscle DGC. β- and δ-sarcoglycan were enriched in smooth muscle DGC to a similar level as ε-sarcoglycan, but immunoblots of smooth muscle DGC did not stain with antibodies against α- and γ-sarcoglycan (Fig. 3). The molecular weight of δ-sarcoglycan and β-dystroglycan also seemed to be slightly lower in smooth muscle cells compared with skeletal muscle fibers (Fig. 3). To further study the composition of smooth muscle DGC, we stained immunoblots with different anti-dystroglycan antibodies. In contrast to the single 156-kDa form of α-dystroglycan in skeletal muscle, we detected two bands of about 156 and 100 kDa with antibodies against α-dystroglycan (goat 20 and sheep OR12) in the smooth muscle DGC (Fig. 3). The anti-α-dystroglycan antibody IIH6, which shows carbohydrate-dependent staining (8Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar), did not react with the smooth muscle form of α-dystroglycan (Fig. 3), indicating different glycosylation patterns of skeletal and smooth muscle α-dystroglycan. The association of ε-sarcoglycan with smooth muscle DGC was further illustrated by centrifugation of smooth muscle DGC through sucrose gradients. Proteins from the sucrose gradient fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting with antisera against DGC components revealed that the peak of smooth muscle DGC migrates in fractions 6–10 (Fig. 4), indicated by the 427-kDa dystrophin band. Western blotting of the same fractions with antibodies against ε-sarcoglycan and β-sarcoglycan demonstrated that ε-sarcoglycan co-migrates in the same fractions as the DGC during sedimentation through sucrose gradients (Fig. 4, and data not shown). This result confirmed that ε-sarcoglycan is an integral component of the DGC in smooth muscle tissue. We also investigated if sarcospan, a recently characterized component of the DGC (7Crosbie R.H. Heighway J. Venzke D.P. Lee J.C. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31221-31224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which had not been studied in smooth muscle, is an integral element of the DGC in smooth muscle cells. By staining immunoblots of sucrose gradient fractions with anti-sarcospan antibodies, we illustrated that the peak of sarcospan also migrates in fractions 6–10, supporting the role of sarcospan as a constitutive component of the DGC. Analysis of sucrose gradient fractions with antibodies against α- and β-dystroglycan showed an additional protein peak for the dystroglycans in fractions 3–5 (Fig. 4). The 100-kDa form of α-dystroglycan was particularly enriched in these fractions whereas the 156-kDa form was mainly found in fractions 6–10 together with the other DGC components, including ε-sarcoglycan. Considering that the vast majority of cells in the muscularis propria of the pylorus are smooth muscle, these findings suggest the existence of two separate dystroglycan complexes in smooth muscle: on"

Numerous studies have shown that their survival below 90 percent relative humidity dry weight, is limited to hours. However, little attention has been paid to physiological adaptations to more realistic desiccation regimes, such as at the permanent wilting point of plants (98.9 percent relative humidity). A water vapor absorption mechanism is described that allows a common soil collembolan, Folsomia candida, to remain active down to below the permanent wilting point. A reevaluation of the water physiology of this widespread and diverse animal group is required."

After peak interglacial conditions, temperatures decreased and precipitation increased in a series of steps.

However, when this MUC5AC peptide was first glycosylated with ppGaNTase-T1 to yield mainly GTT(GalNAc)PSPVPTTSTT(GalNAc)SAP (but also mono- and tri-substituted species), the ppGaNTase-T6 isoform was active toward the glycopeptidic preparation. This suggests that the addition of the initialO-linked sugar may occur in a hierarchical manner with the action of certain ppGaNTases necessary prior to the action of others. The conserved amino acid regions EIWGGEN and VWMDEYK were used to design sense and antisense PCR primers, d(GARATHTGGGGNGGNGARAA) (321 sense) and d(TTRTAYTCRTCCATCCANAC) (379 antisense). These were used to perform PCR reactions on rat sublingual gland (rat SLG) cDNA; the resultant 200-base pair PCR products were cloned into M13 vehicles and screened as described previously (10Ten Hagen K.G.

Positively hybridizing M13 clones were sequenced with infrared fluorescent dye-labeled primers on an LI-COR DNA 4000L DNA sequencer. The insert from a unique clone was used to generate an asymmetrically labeled PCR probe using the oligonucleotide 379 antisense. This probe was then used to screen 1 × 106 plaques from an oligo(dT)-primed Uni-Zap XR rat sublingual gland cDNA library (10Ten Hagen K.G. Hagen F.K. Balys M.M. Beres T.M. VanWuyckhuyse B. Tabak L.A.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). One of the four positive clones obtained was fully sequenced. The N-terminal transmembrane domain was determined by a Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity plot. Sequence alignments were performed using the Clustal method of Megalign (DNASTAR) and began at the conserved region FNXXXSD in the putative lumenal domain (amino acid position 84 in ppGaNTase-T1, 100 in ppGaNTase-T2, 150 in ppGaNTase-T3, 102 in ppGaNTase-T4, 454 in ppGaNTase-T5, and 175 in ppGaNTase-T6). Amino acid sequences were aligned, one pair at a time, using the pairwise ClustalW (1.4) algorithm in MacVector (Oxford Molecular Group). The following alignment modes and parameters were used: slow alignment, open gap penalty = 10, extended gap penalty = 0.1, similarity matrix = blosum, delay divergence = 40%, and no hydrophilic gap penalty. The percent amino acid sequence similarity displayed in Table I represents the sum of the percent identities and similarities. Sequences comprising the conserved domains used in Table I begin with the first amino acid in Fig. 2 and end with a conserved proline (amino acid position 425 in ppGaNTase-T1, 440 in ppGaNTase-T2, 499 in ppGaNTase-T3, 438 in ppGaNTase-T4, 796 in ppGaNTase-T5, and 524 in ppGaNTase-T6). The segment of conserved sequences is approximately 340 amino acids in length in the various isoforms.Table IAmino acid similarity between ppGaNTase isoforms within a 340-aa conserved domainrT1hT2mT3mT4rT5rT6rT1NA7071706861hT270NA66686559mT37166NA696457mT4706869NA6559rT568656465NA57rT66159575957NAPercent amino acid similarity is shown for an ∼340-aa conserved domain, using pairwise ClustalW alignments, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” rT1, rat ppGaNTase-T1; hT2, human ppGaNTase-T2; mT3, mouse ppGaNTase-T3; mT4, mouse ppGaNTase-T4; rT5, rat ppGaNTase-T5; rT6, rat ppGaNTase-T6; NA, not applicable.

Total RNA from BALB/c mouse and Wistar rat tissues was extracted according to the single step isolation method described in Ausubel et al. (13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D.

Following electrophoresis in a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, rat and mouse total RNA samples were transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to Sambrook et al. (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A segment of the ppGaNTase-T6 cDNA region, from nucleotide position 1305 to 1473, was labeled by asymmetric PCR (14Bednarczuk T.A. Wiggins R.C. Konat G.W. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 478-479PubMed Google Scholar) using the antisense oligonucleotide d(GACTTCCACAACACGCACAT) and then used as a probe for ppGaNTase-T6 transcripts. ppGaNTase-T1 and -T4 were detected as described previously (9Hagen F.K.

Antisense 18 S ribosomal subunit oligonucleotide d(TATTGGAGCTGGAATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG) was end-labeled as described (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and used to normalize sample loading by hybridizing with 5 mexcess of probe. All hybridizations were performed in 5× SSPE, 50% formamide at 42 °C with two final washes in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min. The 2.2-kilobase full-length cDNA (isolated from the rat sublingual gland cDNA library) for ppGaNTase-T6 was cloned into thePstI site of Phagescript SK (Stratagene). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (15Kunkle T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) was performed on deoxyuracil-containing single-stranded DNA from this construct using the oligonucleotide d(ACGACCCGAACGCGTTGAGCAGGAT), which generates anMluI site 3′ of the putative hydrophobic transmembrane domain (at nucleotide position 107 of ppGaNTase-T6). This modified vector was used to clone a 5′-truncated form of the ppGaNTase-T6 cDNA (from the newly introduced MluI site to thePstI site at nucleotide position 2155) into the mammalian expression vector pIMKF1 (9Hagen F.K.

Equivalent amounts (units) of each enzyme (as determined by SDS-PAGE gel quantitation) were used in each assay. No enzymatic activity for ppGaNTase-T6 was detected in any of these initial assays. Subsequent assays of ppGaNTase-T1 and -T6 activity (Figs. 4 and 5) were performed with cell culture media and the MUC5AC peptide (GTTPSPVPTTSTTSAP) in a total volume of 40 μl at the following final concentrations: 1 mm peptide substrate; 125 mm MES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100; 12.5 mmMnCl2; 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; 1 mm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methyl butane; 1 mm phenylfluoromethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1.25 mm AMP. The enzyme samples were preincubated in this reaction mixture for 20 min at 37 °C, and then the reaction was initiated with the addition of UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine and UDP-[3H]GalNAc (7.8 Ci·mmol−1; 288.6 GBq·mmol−1; 0.1 mCi·ml−1) to final concentrations of 1 mm and 1.25 nm, respectively. Reactions proceeded for 24 h at 37 °C. To minimize the possibility of dipeptidylaminotransferase or other peptidase activities that could confound the MALDI-MS analysis, the thiol inhibitortrans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-3-methyl butane and serine peptidase inhibitors were included in the reaction mixture as described previously (22Soudan B.

Reactions were stopped by the addition of 8 volumes of 20 mm sodium borate, 1 mm EDTA (pH 9.1). Reaction products were passed through AG1-X8 resin and eluted with 3 ml of water, and incorporation was determined by scintillation counting. Background values obtained from controls incubated without peptide substrate were subtracted from each experimental value. Products from the above mentioned incubations using ppGaNTase-T1 cell culture media were recovered by using Sep-Pak C18 reverse-phase cartridges (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) as described previously (23Hennebicq S.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry was performed using a Vision 2000 time-of-flight instrument (Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a 337 nm UV laser. The mass spectra were acquired in reflectron mode under 6 kV acceleration voltage and positive detection.

External calibration was performed using the MUC5AC peptide (M r 1502.7). 10–30 shots were accumulated for the mass spectrum. Capillary electrophoresis was performed on a P/ACE system model 5000 (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) under conditions previously described (23Hennebicq S. Soudan B. Tetaert D. Briand G. Richet C. Demeyer D.

To determine O-linkage sites, a preparative scale procedure was performed as described by Bielher and Schwartz (25Bielher R. Schwartz H.E.

Large quantities of glycosylated MUC5AC were prepared by incubation with Pichia pastoris-derived recombinant ppGaNTase-T1. 2H. Mao, K. Nehrke, B. VanWuyckhuyse, and L. A. Tabak, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, the ppGaNTase-T1 coding segment from pF3-mT1 (27Hagen F.K. Nehrke K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8268-8277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was inserted into theEcoRI site of a modified Pichia expression vector, pPIC (Invitrogen). Pichia containing this vector were grown and expression was induced according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Recombinant ppGaNTase-T1 was purified as described previously (4Hagen F.K. VanWuyckhuyse B. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18960-18965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pichia-derived recombinant ppGaNTase-T1 and ppGaNTase-T1 expressed from COS7 cells displayed similar substrate specificities and kinetic parameters.2 Pichia-derived ppGaNTase-T1 (0.028 μg) was incubated with 1 mg of MUC5AC under the conditions described above, using UDP-[3H]GalNAc (7.8 Ci·mmol−1; 288.6 GBq·mmol−1; 0.1 mCi·ml−1) at a final concentration of 128.2 μm and cold UDP-GalNAc at a final concentration of 30 mm. Reaction products were passed through a AG1-X8 column, and incorporation was determined by scintillation counting. The reaction products were isolated on a Waters 265 HPLC using a Vydac C-18 reverse phase column (0.46 × 25 cm) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a linear gradient of 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min at 22 °C. Mass spectrometry was performed on purified products at the Louisiana State University Mass Spectrometry Facility using pulsed extraction and in reflector mode on a Bruker (Billerica, MA) ProFLEX III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. The matrix used was α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Two-point calibrations were performed using peptides that have masses above and below the range of the masses of our samples. The most abundant product recovered (the tri-glycopeptide) was subjected to Edman degradation as described previously (28Gerken T.A. Owen C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using a PE Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer (Foster City, CA). This purified MUC5AC tri-glycopeptide (100 nmol) and the MUC5AC parent peptide (100 nmol) were oxidized with 200 μl of 0.08 mNaIO4 in 0.05 m acetate buffer (pH 4.5) at 4 °C for 60 h in the dark (29Goldstein I.J. Hong G.W. Lewis B.A. Smith F. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 361-367Google Scholar) in side by side reactions. Excess periodate was destroyed by adding 20 μl of ethylene glycol. The reaction mixtures were adjusted to pH 7.5 with 1 nNaOH. Sodium borohydride was added to a final concentration of 0.2m and reduction continued for 24 h at 4 °C. Excess borohydride was destroyed by the addition of 20 μl of glacial acetic acid, and released boric acid was evaporated several times with methanol. The reaction mixtures were purified by HPLC as described in the previous paragraph. Capillary electrophoresis was performed on an Applied Biosystems 270A-HT capillary electrophoresis system using 2n formic acid, 2.5% polyvinyl alcohol (v/v) and a fused silica capillary column (0.75 μm inner diameter) with 50 cm to the optical path and running voltage of 15 kV. Periodate-treated MUC5AC and the MUC5AC tri-glycopeptide as well as untreated MUC5AC and MUC5AC tri-glycopeptide were then used as substrates in reactions with COS7 cell-derived ppGaNTase-T1, ppGaNTase-T6, or mock media. Reactions were carried out in duplicate as described above with the following modifications: 15 μg of each peptide/glycopeptide substrate were used in each reaction; the final concentration of UDP-[14C]GalNAc (54.7 mCi·mmol−1; 2.02 Gbq·mmol−1; 0.02 mCi·ml−1) was 21.78 nm and the final concentration of cold UDP-GalNAc was 0.96 mm; the final reaction volume was 50 μl. Reaction products were passed through AG1-X8 resin; incorporation was determined by scintillation counting. Primary sequence alignments of previously identified members of the ppGaNTase family revealed many conserved regions within an approximately 420-amino acid segment of the proteins (9Hagen F.K.

We designed degenerate PCR primers to short blocks of highly conserved sequences, EIWGGEN and VWMDEYK. PCR was performed on cDNA from rat SLG, and clones were purified and sequenced to identify the nature of the insert as described previously (10Ten Hagen K.G. Hagen F.K. Balys M.M. Beres T.M.

From this screening, a novel PCR product was identified that shared homology with previously characterized isoforms. The insert from this clone was used as a probe to screen a rat sublingual gland cDNA library. A cDNA containing a complete open reading frame was sequenced and given the designation, ppGaNTase-T6. As shown in Fig. 1, the cDNA encoding ppGaNTase-T6 contains a 2228-base pair insert encoding a unique 657-amino acid protein. No upstream termination codon or Kozak sequence was found. Conceptual translation of this cDNA revealed a type II membrane protein architecture, typical of the ppGaNTase family. The enzyme consists of a potentially short N-terminal cytoplasmic region, a 27-amino acid hydrophobic region, a 147-amino acid stem region, and a 483-amino acid lumenal region. As shown in Fig.2, ppGaNTase-T6 is distinct from previously identified mammalian isoforms yet shares many blocks of sequence similarity or identity between consensus amino acid 174 and 657. Table I summarizes the degree of amino acid similarity between each of the known isoforms within the conserved lumenal region; ppGaNTase-T6 has the lowest similarity when compared with the other isoforms. Northern blots of mouse and rat total RNA were probed with a ppGaNTase-T6-specific probe (Fig.3) as well as probes specific for previously characterized isoforms. The highest levels of the 4.8-kilobase ppGaNTase-T6 message were found in the SLG, with lower levels seen in stomach, small intestine,"

The purification scheme included Triton X-100 extraction of membranes followed by Q-Sepharose, blue Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, and MonoS column chromatography. The purified enzyme showed an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa as estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and 95 kDa by chromatography on Superose 12. Using C16-ceramide as substrate, the enzyme showed a broad pH optimum in the neutral to alkaline range. A mixed micelle assay was developed, and using Triton X-100/ceramide mixed micelles, the enzyme exhibited classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with aK m of 1.29 mol % and aV max of 4.4 μmol/min/mg. When dihydroceramide was used as substrate, these values were 3.84 mol % and 1.2 μmol/min/mg, respectively, indicating that the enzyme hydrolyzes ceramides preferentially. The activity of the purified ceramidase did not require cations, and it was inhibited by reducing agents. Phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin were without effect on the enzyme activity, whereas phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine stimulated the activity 3-fold. Sphingosine acted as a competitive inhibitor with an IC50 of 5–10 μm. These results indicate that the purified enzyme is a novel ceramidase.

A mixed micelle assay was developed, and using Triton X-100/ceramide mixed micelles, the enzyme exhibited classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with aK m of 1.29 mol % and aV max of 4.4 μmol/min/mg. When dihydroceramide was used as substrate, these values were 3.84 mol % and 1.2 μmol/min/mg, respectively, indicating that the enzyme hydrolyzes ceramides preferentially. The activity of the purified ceramidase did not require cations, and it was inhibited by reducing agents. Phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin were without effect on the enzyme activity, whereas phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine stimulated the activity 3-fold. Sphingosine acted as a competitive inhibitor with an IC50 of 5–10 μm. These results indicate that the purified enzyme is a novel ceramidase. Sphingolipid metabolites are now recognized as important components in signal transduction, not only in mammalian cells, but also in yeast, where they are implicated in heat stress responses.

Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).As a consequence of this diverse biology, the study and characterization of enzymes that regulate ceramide levels has become an essential area of study. Ceramidases (CDases) are enzymes that cleave the N-acyl linkage of ceramide into sphingosine (SPH) and free fatty acid, and recent studies suggest that CDase may exert important functions in the regulation of its substrate (Cer) or in the regulation of its immediate product (SPH) or the downstream metabolite sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP). Indeed, current understanding indicates that the major pathway for the formation of sphingosine is via the degradation of ceramide and not from the de novo pathway (4Merrill A.H. Wang E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,5Michel C. Van Echten-Deckert G. Rother J. Sandhoff K. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22432-22437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This suggests that CDases are the key enzymes to regulate levels of SPH. Two reports implicate an alkaline CDase activity in signal transduction. Using cell homogenate of rat glomerular mesangial cells, Coroneos et al. (6Coroneos E. Martinez M. McKenna S. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) have shown that an alkaline CDase activity was stimulated by the platelet-derived growth factor and not by the inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-1) or the vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1. In another report, Nikolova-Karakashian et al. (7Nikolova-Karakashian M. Morgan E.T. Alexander C. Liotta D.C. Merril Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18718-18724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) showed in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes that alkaline CDase activity is stimulated by low concentrations of interleukin-1. The activation of CDase in these cells resulted in the formation of SPH, and these authors suggested that SPH or SPP may mediate some of the effects of low concentrations of interleukin-1. In addition, studies using inhibitors of CDases (N-oleoylethanolamine andd-erythro-2-(N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol) have also shown that inhibition of these enzymes causes an elevation in the endogenous level of ceramide that is either sufficient to inhibit growth or augments the effects of other inducers of growth arrest (8Wiesner D.A.

Taken together, these observations underscore the potential importance of CDases and their roles in different process such as apoptosis and proliferation.Three ceramidases have been described that differ by their pH optima. An acid ceramidase was first described by Gatt (10Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3131-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in rat brain. The enzyme has been purified and cloned from human urine (11Koch J. Gärtner S. Li C.-M. Quintern L.E. Bernardo K. Levran O. Schnabel D. Desnick R.J. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol.

Sandhoff K. Shuchman E.H. Genomics. 1998; 50: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This enzyme is located in the lysosomes, and it plays a role in the catabolic pathway of ceramide, and the inherited deficiency of this enzyme causes Farber disease (13Sugita M. Dulaney J.T. Moser H.W. Science. 1972; 178: 1100-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A neutral activity has been described in liver plasma membranes (14Slife C.W. Wang E. Hunter R. Wang S. Burgess C. Liotta D.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10371-10377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in rat intestinal brush border membranes (15Nilsson A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 176: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar); little is known about this enzyme. An alkaline activity was described in human cerebellum (16Sugita M. Williams M. Dulaney J.T. Moser H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 398: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), fibroblasts (17Momoi T. Ben-Yoseph Y. Nalder H.L. Biochem. J. 1982; 205: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and in many rat tissues (18Spence M.W. Beed S. Cook H.W. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1985; 64: 400-404Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Alkaline CDases were best characterized in Guinea pig skin epidermis (19Yada Y. Higuchi K. Imokawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12677-12684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), where two enzymes were purified, one to apparent homogeneity and the other only partially. These two enzymes are membrane-bound, and their estimated molecular masses on SDS-PAGE were 60 and 148 kDa, respectively.In this study, we have purified a membrane-bound ceramidase to apparent homogeneity. On SDS-PAGE, the enzyme appeared as a single protein of 90 kDa. The activity of this enzyme is independent of cations, inhibited by reducing agents, and stimulated by PS and phosphatidic acid. Based on these results, this enzyme appears to be a novel CDase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsFrozen rat brains were purchased from Pel-Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AK). Hitrap Q-Sepharose high performance, Hitrap blue Sepharose high performance, MonoS (HR 5/5), MonoP (HR 5/5), and Superose 12 (HR 10/30) columns and phenyl-Sepharose high performance, polybuffer 96, and polybuffer 74 media were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Centriprep and Centricon sample concentrators were from Amicon, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Pro-blue staining and silver staining kits were from Owl Separation Systems (Portsmouth, NH). Triton X-100 was from Sigma. Bradford protein assay, isoelectric focusing gels (pH 3–10), isoelectric focusing standard mixture, and gel electrophoresis apparatus were from Bio-Rad. BCA protein assay, CHAPS, and β-octyl glucoside were from Pierce. Polyacrylamide gels were from Novex. [3H]C16-ceramide, ceramides with various chain length, sphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine were synthesized as described (9Bielawska A. Greenberg M.S. Perry D. Jayadev S. Shayman J.A. McKay C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12646-12654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and other lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids.CDase AssayCDase activity was measured according to the protocol described by Yavin and Gatt (20Yavin E. Gatt S. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 nmol of [3H]C16-ceramide were mixed with 100 μl of Triton X-100 (0.2%) and 100 μl of sodium cholate (0.4%) in chloroform/methanol (2:1), and the solvent was dried. The dried mixture was resuspended in water by heating at 80 °C for 5 s, and the appropriate buffer and amount of enzyme were added. The reaction was terminated by adding 2 ml of isopropyl alcohol/heptane/1 nNaOH, 4:1:0.1 (Dole solution), followed by 1 ml of water and 1 ml of heptane. After centrifugation, the upper phase was discarded, and the lower phase was washed twice with heptane. Finally, 1 ml of sulfuric acid (1 n) and 2 ml of heptane were added, the mixture was centrifuged, and the upper phase containing the fatty acid was counted in liquid scintillation. In the experiments of enzyme characterization or where the effects of other lipids were tested, these lipids were dried with the substrate and then resuspended in 100 μl of Triton X-100 (1%). The final Triton X-100 concentration in the assay was 0.5%. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyze 1 nmol of ceramide/min at 37 °C.Protein Assay and SDS-PAGEProtein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay or the BCA assay in samples containing Triton X-100. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by Pro-blue staining followed by silver staining.Fractionation and Triton X-100 ExtractionFrozen rat brains (53–58 g) were thawed in 150 ml of 20 mm cold phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (homogenization buffer). Brains were then homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 10 min, and the pellet of this centrifugation was homogenized again using 80 ml of homogenization buffer. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min, the pellet was washed twice with 50 ml of homogenization buffer. All supernatants were combined and designated as the postnuclear supernatant fraction. The postnuclear supernatant fraction was then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 30 min. The pellet of this centrifugation was resuspended in 145 ml of Tris 20 mm, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100. After stirring for 1 h, the Triton X-100-solubilized fraction was obtained by centrifuging the mixture at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (Triton X-100 extract) was used as a source for ceramidase purification. All steps were carried out at 4 °C.In initial experiments, aiming to determine the ceramidase-rich fraction, the 10,000 × g supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g to obtain the plasma membrane rich fraction (pellet) and the cytosol (supernatant).Q-SepharoseThe Triton X-100 extract was applied directly to a Q-sepharose high performance column (25 ml) equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.005% Triton X-100) at 1 ml/min. Unbound proteins were eluted by washing the column with 75 ml of buffer A. The bound proteins were then eluted with a 250-ml linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.3 m in buffer A. The salt concentration was then increased to 1.5 m for 100 ml, and then for another 75 ml it was combined with 0.5% Triton X-100 to wash out tightly bound proteins. Fractions of 5 ml were collected, ceramidase activity was measured in these fractions, and fractions with peak activity were pooled.Blue SepharoseThe pooled Q-Sepharose fractions were applied directly to a blue Sepharose column (2 ml) equilibrated with buffer B (buffer A plus 0.075 m NaCl) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After the sample was applied, the column was washed with 12 ml of buffer B. Then a 50-ml linear gradient from 0.075 to 0.6m NaCl in buffer A was applied, and the NaCl concentration was then stepped up to 1.5 m for 10 ml. Fractions of 2 ml were collected, and those containing ceramidase activity were pooled.Phenyl-SepharoseFractions of blue Sepharose were adjusted to 0.6 m NaCl and then applied to a phenyl-Sepharose high performance column (0.3 ml) equilibrated with buffer C (buffer A plus 0.6 m NaCl) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. After the sample was applied, the flow rate was increased to 0.5 ml/min, and the column was washed with 5 ml of buffer C. A stepwise elution was then applied using 2 ml of buffer A, then 2 ml of 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5), and then 2 ml of 1 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5). Finally, a 5-ml gradient from 0 to 0.5% of Triton X-100 in 10 mmTris buffer (pH 7.5) was applied. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and ceramidase activity was measured. Fractions containing peak activity (recovered in the Triton X-100 gradient) were combined.MonoSThe pooled fractions from phenyl-Sepharose were adjusted to 50 mm (pH 5.0) acetate buffer, diluted 3 times, and then applied to a MonoS column (1 ml) equilibrated with buffer D (50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After washing the column with 5 ml of buffer D to remove unbound proteins, ceramidase activity was eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.6 m in buffer D. The column was finally washed with 5 ml of 1.5 m NaCl in buffer D. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and ceramidase activity was measured in these fractions.MonoP and Isoelectric Focusing GelsTo determine the isoelectric point of ceramidase, the enzyme was subjected to chromatofocusing on MonoP. The column was equilibrated with buffer A (pH 8.2), and the sample in the same buffer was then applied. Proteins were then eluted by decreasing the pH using a mixture of polybuffer 96 and polybuffer 74 adjusted to pH 5.0 as elution buffer. Samples of 1 ml were collected, and ceramidase and the pH were measured in these fractions. The isoelectric point was also determined using isoelectric focusing gels and by comparing the focusing distance of the nonlysosomal CDase (obtained from the MonoS single band fractions 16 and 17) to a standard curve of protein standards of known isoelectric points.Superose 12When Superose 12 column was used, the pooled fractions from the MonoS column were first concentrated around 10–20-fold to 200 μl using Centricon and Microcon 10-kDa membrane cut-off and then applied to the column equilibrated with buffer E (buffer A plus 0.1 m NaCl) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Proteins were then eluted with 30 ml of buffer E. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, and ceramidase activity was measured.Characterization ExperimentsIn these experiments, the substrate was solubilized by adding the detergent in aqueous solution. In the purification experiments, the enzyme was assayed at pH 9.5 according to Yavin and Gatt (20Yavin E. Gatt S. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) by drying down the detergent (which is in chloroform/methanol, 2:1) with the substrate and by resuspending the mixture in water. Experiments for optimization of assay were performed on the blue Sepharose-purified enzyme. All other characterization experiments were performed on the enzyme obtained from the single band fractions of the MonoS column. When reducing agents were tested, the enzyme was preincubated with these agents for 2 min prior to the assay. When lipid effects were tested, lipids were dried down with the substrate, and the mixture was resuspended with Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 0.5%.RESULTSPurification of CeramidaseCeramidase activity appears to be distributed in all tissues, and it is highly expressed in kidney and in brain (18Spence M.W. Beed S. Cook H.W. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1985; 64: 400-404Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). At pH 9.5, we found higher activity in rat brain (7 nmol/h/mg of protein) compared with rat liver (2 nmol/h/mg of protein). Therefore, we chose to purify the enzyme from rat brain. Preliminary experiments showed that more than one CDase exists in rat brain tissue. At least two characteristics, the intracellular localization (subfractionation) and the pH optimum, differ among these enzymes. Fractionation studies showed that most of the membrane-bound CDase activity can be recovered in the 10,000 × g pellet fraction (Table I). The pH profile of this fraction showed that it contained a ceramidase with a broad pH optimum in the neutral to alkaline range (not shown). Thus, we used this fraction to purify this membrane-bound CDase activity. We solubilized the enzyme with Triton X-100 at a concentration of 0.5%, since this detergent has been shown to be efficient in solubilizing and stabilizing several membrane proteins.Table IFractionation of rat brain homogenateStepProteinsActivitySpecific activitymg (%)units (%)units/mgPostnuclear supernatant148.4 (100)17.5 (100)0.1210,000 ×g pellet64.1 (43.2)9.9 (56.5)0.15100,000 × g pellet11.3 (7.6)1.1 (6.3)0.1Cytosol72.3 (48.7)5.1 (29.1)0.07Rat brains (2Mathias S.

J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) were homogenized, and the postnuclear supernatant was fractionated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” CDase activity was measured at pH 9.5 using glycine buffer at 100 mm. Open table in a new tab As a first step, the Triton X-100 extract was applied to a Q-sepharose column. Ceramidase bound to this column, and it was then eluted with a very shallow NaCl gradient. As shown in Fig.1 A, CDase activity eluted from the column with low NaCl concentrations (0.07–0.08 m). When the column was washed with high salt concentrations (up to 1.5m NaCl), we could not detect any remaining activity bound to the column. However, when Triton X-100 (0.5%) was then applied in combination with the salt, another peak of CDase activity eluted from the column. This peak of activity represented 40–50% of the total activity loaded on the column, and it could represent the same enzyme eluted with salt but in a more hydrophobic conformation, or it could represent another isoenzyme. We did not purify any further this salt/Triton X-100-eluted enzyme, and we focused our purification on the salt-eluted enzyme, since we suspected this form of the enzyme was less hydrophobic. In this step of purification, the enzyme was enriched about 20-fold. This step was also important because it allowed us to keep the sample concentrated by using smaller columns in the following steps. The enzyme was recovered from this column with 80% yield, and 40–50% of the activity eluted when Triton X-100 was added to the salt (Table II).Table IIPurification of CDase from rat brainStepProteinsActivitySpecific activityRecoveryPurificationmgunitsunits/mg%-foldPostnuclear supernatant2504323.70.129100110,000 ×g pellet923168.60.18521.4Triton X-100 extract582155.50.27482.1Q-Sepharose19.869.23.52127Blue Sepharose5.758.810.31880Phenyl-Sepharose0.08650.0580.5154,488MonoS0.012636.52,894.91122,383CDase was purified from 30 rat brains (55 g) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Next the active fractions were applied to a blue Sepharose column. The enzyme eluted from the column upon application of a NaCl gradient as a single broad peak with NaCl concentrations of 0.2–0.4 m(Fig. 1 B). The specific activity after this step was increased 4–5 times. The combined fractions from the blue Sepharose separation were adjusted to 0.6 m NaCl and then applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column. As the amount of protein was low, we used a small column having a volume of 0.3 ml. When the salt concentration was decreased to zero (elution with buffer A), the CDase activity did not elute from the column, but when a Triton X-100 gradient was applied, CDase eluted from the column (Fig. 1 C). In this step, a 50-fold increase in the specific activity was obtained.The isoelectric point of CDase was determined to be 6.2–6.5 (see Fig.5), and based on this we used a cation exchange chromatography on MonoS as the next step. Using acetate buffer, pH 5.0, CDase bound to the MonoS column and eluted with NaCl concentrations around 0.2m (Fig. 2 A). Aliquots from fractions of MonoS separation subjected to SDS-PAGE showed that the peak of activity of CDase (fractions 16–18) corresponded to a single protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa (Fig. 2 B). This final step increased the specific activity by another 5-fold, yielding an overall increase of the specific activity of 22,300-fold. The overall recovery was 11%, but if we take into consideration that some activity from the postnuclear supernatant fractionated into the cytosol and that on the first column two peaks of activity were obtained, the overall recovery of this specific CDase is estimated to be even higher.Figure 5Physical properties of CDase . A, CDase activity, concentrated to 200 μl, was applied to a Superose 12 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer E. Proteins were then eluted with 30 ml of buffer E. Standard molecular mass markers were loaded onto the column, and the elution volumes were used to calibrate the column. B, CDase activity in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.2) was applied to a MonoP chromatofocusing column equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted by decreasing the pH using a mixture of polybuffers 97 and 74 adjusted at pH 5.0. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and CDase activity and the pH were measured on these fractions.C, CDase obtained from fractions 16 and 17 of the MonoS column was applied on isoelectric focusing polyacrylamide gel (pH 3–10). After running according to the manufacturer's procedure, proteins were visualized by silver stain, and the focusing distances of CDase and standards were measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2A, purification of CDase on MonoS cation exchange chromatography. The active fractions from phenyl-Sepharose were adjusted to 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and then applied to a MonoS column equilibrated with buffer D.

The pH optimum ranged from 7 to 10. At pH 11 significant activity was still observed, whereas at pH lower than 4.5 no activity was noted, indicating clearly that this enzyme is different from the lysosomal acid ceramidase. We therefore chose to name this enzyme as nonlysosomal CDase, since it was neither strictly neutral nor alkaline.Figure 3pH dependence of CDase activity. The activity of CDase was measured on 5–10 ng of protein (in 5 μl) from MonoS column (fractions 16 and 17) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The pH was adjusted by the addition of the indicated buffers at a final concentration of 100 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Optimization of Ceramidase AssayIn the purification experiments, we assayed the activity according to the protocol described by Yavin and Gatt (20Yavin E. Gatt S. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% sodium cholate. To optimize the assay, we first examined whether sodium cholate is required for the assay, and therefore we performed kinetic analysis of substrate dependence in the presence or absence of sodium cholate. Fig.4 A shows that there was no significant difference between the curves when the enzyme was assayed with or without sodium cholate, indicating that the addition of sodium cholate was not necessary for the assay of this purified enzyme.Figure 4Optimization of CDase assay. A, effect of sodium cholate on CDase activity as measured according to Yavin and Gatt (20Yavin E. Gatt S. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). B and C, CDase assay was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of the indicated detergents. The mol % ratio of ceramide was kept constant at 1 mol % (Cer concentrations were increased from 8 to 72 μm) for Triton X-100 experiments and 0.1 mol % (Cer concentrations were increased from 10 to 100 μm) for CHAPS and β-octyl glucoside experiments. D, Lineweaver-Burk representation of CHAPS effect on CDase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we tested other detergents to solubilize ceramide. To do this, we tested the effects of increasing concentrations (up to 10 times the critical micellar concentration) of Triton X-100, CHAPS, and β-octyl glucoside on CDase activity while keeping the ceramide concentration at a fixed mol % (ceramide and Triton X-100 molar concentrations were increased in parallel to keep the mol % concentration of ceramide fixed). This was approached as such since most lipid-acting or lipid-regulated enzymes respond to the mole fraction of the lipid substrate/regulator in the micelle rather than to the bulk (molar) concentration. For a thorough discussion, refer to Hannun et al. (22Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10039-10043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Robson and Dennis (23Robson R.J. Dennis E.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 1983; 16: 251-258Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 B shows that the enzyme activity was independent of Triton X-100 concentration. Octyl glucoside inhibited the enzyme, whereas CHAPS stimulated CDase activity (Fig. 4 C). Fig. 4 D shows that CHAPS stimulated ceramidase activity by increasing theV max of the reaction. From these experiments, we concluded that Triton X-100 did not affect ceramidase activity, and we therefore used Triton X-100-based mixed micelles in all subsequent experiments.Physical Properties of CDaseUpon SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, the enzyme appeared as a single protein with an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa (Fig. 2 B). Using gel filtration chromatography on Superose 12, the estimated molecular mass was around 95 kDa (Fig. 5 A). In this step, Triton X-100 concentration (0.005%) was lower than the critical micellar concentration (∼0.02%), indicating that the estimated molecular weight corresponds the native enzyme and not to the enzyme in Triton X-100 micelles.The isolelectric po"

This coincident induction of LTF requires that (i) the synaptic pulse occur within a brief temporal window of the somatic pulse, and (ii) local protein synthesis occur immediately at the synapse, followed by delayed protein synthesis at the soma."
https://openalex.org/W2049807989,"The HB-19 pseudopeptide 5[Kψ(CH2N)PR]-TASP, ψ(CH2N) for reduced peptide bond, is a specific inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in different CD4+ cell lines and in primary T-lymphocytes and macrophages. Here, by using an experimental CD4+ cell model to monitor HIV entry and infection, we demonstrate that HB-19 binds the cell surface and inhibits attachment of HIV particles to permissive cells. At concentrations that inhibit HIV attachment, HB-19 binds cells irreversibly, becomes complexed with the cell-surface-expressed nucleolin, and eventually results in its degradation. Accordingly, by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate the drastic reduction of the cell-surface-expressed nucleolin following treatment of cells with HB-19. HIV particles can prevent the binding of HB-19 to cells and inhibit complex formation with nucleolin. Such a competition between viral particles and HB-19 is consistent with the implication of nucleolin in the process of HIV attachment to target cells. We show that another inhibitor of HIV infection, the fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) that uses cell-surface-expressed heparan sulfate proteoglycans as low affinity receptors, binds cells and blocks attachment of HIV to permissive cells. FGF-2 does not prevent the binding of HB-19 to cells and to nucleolin, and similarly HB-19 has no apparent effect on the binding of FGF-2 to the cell surface. The lack of competition between these two anti-HIV agents rules out the potential involvement of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the mechanism of anti-HIV effect of HB-19, thus pointing out that nucleolin is its main target.

The gp120 has a complex secondary structure in which five conserved regions (C1 to C5) and five hypervariable regions (V1 to V5) have been defined. It exists as an oligomer associated noncovalently with the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41 which at its amino terminus contains a hydrophobic domain essential for the fusion process (1Bour S.

Studies on the mechanism of HIV tropism have revealed that chemokine receptors such as CCR5 and CXCR4 serve as essential cofactors specific for the entry of macrophage (M)- and T-lymphocyte-tropic HIV-1 isolates, respectively (reviewed in Refs. 3Wyatt R.

Consequently, infection of cells by both types of HIV-1 isolates could be inhibited by chemokines interacting specifically with their respective receptors (5de Roda Husman A.-M. Schuitemaker H.

Besides CCR5, additional β-chemokine receptors including CCR2b, CCR3, and CCR8 are used by some HIV-1 variants (5de Roda Husman A.-M. Schuitemaker H. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 244-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It should be noted that chemokines inhibit HIV entry without affecting the attachment of HIV particles to cells (8Oravecz T. Pall M. Norcross M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1329-1332PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cocchi F. DeVico A.L. Garzino-Demo A. Cara A. Gallo R.C. Lusso P. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1244-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Therefore, chemokines appear to block a step following attachment of HIV particles to cells, namely fusion between viral and cellular membranes. By incubation of cells with soluble preparations of gp120, several groups have demonstrated the formation of a complex between gp120, CD4 and CCR5, or CXCR4 and have proposed that HIV-1 attachment to CD4+ cells creates a high affinity interaction site for the coreceptor and that during this event the V3 loop plays an important role by a mechanism that remains to be elucidated (3Wyatt R.

Ugolini S. Sattentau Q.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3623-3634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In CD4+ T-cells, HIV attachment is mediated by both CD4-dependent and -independent interactions (11Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Krust B. Franco R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neutralizing mAbs specific for the V3 loop inhibit both CD4-dependent and -independent interactions, whereas neutralizing mAbs against the gp120 binding domain in CD4 or against the CD4 binding domain in gp120 affect only the CD4-dependent interaction. The observation that anti-V3 loop mAbs also inhibit HIV attachment to CD4− cells (11Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Krust B. Franco R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that interaction of the V3 loop with its cell-surface ligands can occur at a step prior to the interaction of gp120 with CD4. In accord with this, several studies have suggested that the V3 loop domain is not necessary for the binding of gp120 to CD4 (12Pollard S.R. Rosa M.D. Rosa J.J. Wiey D.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 13Wyatt R. Sullivan N. Thali M. Repke H. Ho D. Robinson J. Posner M. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4557-4565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations and the fact that mAbs against the V3 loop block HIV attachment to cells without affecting the potential interaction of gp120 with CD4 (11Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Krust B. Franco R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that interactions through the V3 loop and the CD4-binding site of gp120 are two independent events. In accord with this, spontaneous mutations within the V3 loop have been proposed to be responsible for CD4-independent entry of the HIV-1 NDK isolate (14Dumonceaux J. Nisole S. Chanel C. Quivet L. Amara A. Baleux F. Briand P. Hazan U. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 512-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the V3 loop is relatively exposed on HIV particles (15Nyambi P.N. Gorny M.K. Bastiani L. Van der Groen G. Williams C. Zolla-Pazner S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9384-9391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by virtue of its positively charged residues, it could interact directly with negatively charged components of the cell surface independent of CD4 and chemokine receptors. Potential candidates of such cell-surface components are on the one hand V3 loop binding proteins on the cell surface (discussed in Ref. 16Callebaut C. Blanco J. Benkirane N. Krust B. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Seddiki N. Svab J. Dam E. Muller S. Briand J.P. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol.

The pseudopeptide 5[Kψ(CH2N)PR]TASP referred to as HB-19, which presents pentavalently the Kψ(CH2N)PR tripeptide moiety, is a potent inhibitor of HIV infection of CD4+ T-cell lines or primary T-lymphocytes and macrophages (20Callebaut C.

HB-19 does not have a significant effect on infection of cells by the simian immunodeficiency virus-mac isolate or by HIV-1 pseudotyped with envelope glycoproteins of other viruses (16Callebaut C.

Briand, and A. G. Hovanessian, submitted for publication. We confirm here that the anti-HIV effect of HB-19 is due to inhibition of the attachment of HIV-1 particles to target cells leading to inhibition of viral entry. The biotin-labeled HB-19 but not the control constructs binds specifically target cells and becomes complexed with the cell-surface-expressed nucleolin. Interestingly, HIV particles can compete with HB-19, both in binding to the cell surface and in complex formation with the cell-surface-expressed nucleolin. On the other hand, no apparent competition occurs with the fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), known to use heparan sulfates as low affinity receptors (22Coutts J.C. Gallaher J.T. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 584-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23Webster M.K. Donoghue D.J. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 178-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This latter observation rules out the possibility that cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans serve as additional targets of HB-19. However, consistent with the implication of heparan sulfates in the HIV attachment process (10Mondor I. Ugolini S. Sattentau Q.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3623-3634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Roderiquez G. Oravecz T. Yanagishita M. Chequer Bou-Habib D. Mostowski H. Norcross M.A. J.

Retroviruses. 1993; 9: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), we show that FGF-2 inhibits HIV infection by binding to cells and preventing the attachment of HIV particles. The fact that HIV attachment could be inhibited by two different agents that do not compete suggests that the HIV attachment process should be coordinated by two events implicating on the one hand the cell-surface-expressed nucleolin and on the other hand the heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific to human CD4 and reacting with the gp120 binding domain (11Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Krust B. Franco R. Hovanessian A.G. J.

The HIV-1 pseudotyped with VSV envelope glycoproteins was kindly provided by Dr. Olivier Schwartz (Institut Pasteur, Paris). FGF-2 (fibroblast growth factor basic) produced inEscherichia coli was from Sigma. FGF-2 was iodinated (2 × 103 μCi/μmol) using the Bolton-Hunter reagent (NEN Life Science Products) by a procedure as recommended by the manufacturer. Human HeLa-CD4-LTR-lacZ cells expressing or not CCR5 were referred to as HeLa P4-C5 and HeLa P4, respectively, and were cultured in Dulbecco's medium. These HeLa cells were provided by Drs. Olivier Schwartz and Pierre Charneau (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) and were cultured with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated (56 °C, 30 min) fetal calf serum. The amount of each virus preparation was estimated by the concentration of the major core protein p24 by p24 Core Profile enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DuPont). Aliquots of virus stocks were stored at −130 °C. The virus preparations were filtered (0.22-μm pore size, Millipore) before infection of cells. For the competition studies between HIV particles and HB-19, virus particles were recovered by centrifugation (100,000 × g, for 30 min at 4 °C), and the pellet was suspended in the culture medium and filtered through 0.22-μm pore size filters (Millipore) in order to eliminate aggregates and/or cell debris. Such preparations generated concentrated virus that is highly infectious (11Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Krust B. Franco R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cell monolayers in 150-cm2 flasks were washed extensively with PBS before adding 1 ml of the lysis buffer E, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, aprotinin (1000 units/ml), and 0.5% Triton X-100. After 5 min incubation in buffer E (at room temperature), the flasks were declined and left at a vertical position to collect cell extracts. By this procedure, nucleus-free extracts of HeLa cells could be recovered conveniently since nuclei remain attach to the plastic. Such nucleus-free supernatants were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were stored at −80 °C. The synthesis of 5[Kψ(CH2N)PR]-TASP (herein referred to as HB-19) was as described previously (20Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Krust B. Rey-Cuille M.A. Cointe D. Benkirane N. Blanco J.

For the biotin-labeled compounds, the biotin moiety was introduced during peptide assembly as an Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) Lys-biotin derivative at the carboxyl terminus of the template in HB-19 and 5[QPQ]-TASP and the carboxyl terminus of the Kψ(CH2N)PR monomer. The peptides were obtained at a high purity (>95%), and their integrity was controlled by matrix-associated laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight analysis (29Limal D. Briand J.-P. Dalbon P. Joliver M. J. Pept. Res. 1998; 52: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).

The anti-HIV cyclic peptide TW70 specific for CXCR4 was synthesized as described (30Tamamura H. Waki M. Imai M. Otaka A. Ibuka T. Waki K. Miyamoto K. Matsumoto A. Murakami T. Nakashima H. Yamamoto N.

The TW70 peptide has the amino acid sequence RRWCYRKDKPYRKCR; the DK (whereDK indicates that the peptide bond is in dconfiguration) has been introduced in the sequence of this peptide in order to stabilize the β-turn in the final structure. The disulfide bridge between the two cysteine residues was generated by air oxidation at pH 8 in water under vigorous stirring for 2 days at room temperature. The final cyclic peptide was more than 95% pure. The detection of cell-surface antigens was as described before with minor modifications (28Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Krust B. Guichard G. Blanco J.

Briefly, HeLa cells (about 106) in 6-well plates washed in PBS were incubated (30 min at 4 °C) in 500 μl of FACS buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide) containing the following antibodies: mAb specific to CD4 (CB-T4, IgG1), CXCR4 (12G5, IgG2a), CCR5 (12D1, IgG2a), or nucleolin (D3, IgG1). Cells were then washed in FACS buffer and further incubated (30 min, 4 °C) in the presence of FITC-labeled IgG against mouse immunoglobulins (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur). IgG1/IgG2a were used as control isotype antibodies (from Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). After this second incubation, cells were washed and scraped using a rubber policeman. The cell pellet obtained by centrifugation (350 × g, 8 min) was suspended in PBS, fixed in PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde, and processed for analysis by FACS scan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). For each sample, 10,000 viable cells were gated following size (forward scatter, FSC) and granularity (side scatter, SSC) parameters and analyzed with Cell QuestTMSoftware (Becton Dickinson). The capacity of HB-19 to bind specifically different types of cells could be used to monitor labeled cells by FACS analysis. For this purpose, HeLa cells (as above) were incubated (30 min, either at 4 or at 37 °C) in 500 μl of FACS buffer containing FITC- or biotin-labeled HB-19. Cells were then washed and processed for FACS analysis as described before (16Callebaut C. Blanco J. Benkirane N. Krust B. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Seddiki N. Svab J. Dam E. Muller S. Briand J.P.

After washing extensively in PBS containing 1 mmEDTA (PBS/EDTA), nucleus-free cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer E containing unlabeled HB-19 (50 μm), and the complex formed between cell-surface-expressed nucleolin and the biotin-labeled HB-19 was isolated by purification of the extracts using avidin-agarose (100 μl; ImmunoPure Immobilized Avidin from Pierce) in PBS/EDTA. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the samples were washed extensively with PBS/EDTA. The purified proteins were denatured by heating in the electrophoresis sample buffer containing SDS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

HIV entry was monitored indirectly in HeLa-CD4-LTR-lacZ cells containing the bacterial lacZ gene under the control of HIV-1 LTR. HIV-1 entry and replication results in the activation of the HIV-1 LTR leading to the expression of β-galactosidase (32Dragic T. Charneau P. Clavel F. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4794-4802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa-CD4-LTR-lacZ cells expressing recombinant CD4 and constitutively CXCR4 are permissive to infection by T-tropic HIV-1 isolates (33Schwartz O. Maréchal V. Friguet B. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Heard J.-M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3845-3850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When they also express recombinant CCR5, such HeLa cells become permissive to M-tropic HIV-1 isolates. These two HeLa cell lines expressing or not CCR5 are referred to as HeLa P4-C5 and HeLa P4, respectively. Cells were plated at 104 cells/well in 96-well plates, and at 24 h later cell monolayers were infected with the different HIV isolates (a dose corresponding to 20–40 ng/ml p24). At 48 h, cell monolayers were washed with PBS before lysis of cells in 100 μl/well of buffer L containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After 10 min incubation at room temperature, 100 μl of the reaction mix containing 10 mmphosphate buffer at pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 600 mm chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside was added in each well. The 96-well plate was then incubated at 37 °C, and the β-galactosidase activity was measured at 10–15-min intervals in a microplate reader using a 570 nm filter. The background value in the β-galactosidase activity in each experiment was measured by including an HIV infection in the presence of AZT (5 μm) that inhibits the HIV reverse transcriptase. The background value of β-galactosidase activity was also monitored in cells in which HIV entry was blocked by the anti-CD4 mAb CB-T4 (5 μg/ml) that reacts with the gp120-binding site in CD4 (11Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Krust B. Franco R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of HB-19 on the amount of HIV-1 Lai particles attached to cells (i.e. associated with cells) was monitored after 1 h of incubation at 4 °C. These experiments were carried out at 4 °C in order to reduce HIV endocytosis (33Schwartz O. Maréchal V. Friguet B. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Heard J.-M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3845-3850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and viral entry (34Krust B. Callebaut C. Hovanessian A.G. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1993; 9: 1087-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) at its minimum. HeLa P4 and HeLa P4-C5 cells were treated (37 °C, 30 min) with α-CD4 mAb CB-T4 (at 5 μg/ml), HB-19, FGF-2, and the control peptide constructs before washing cells (with PBS) to eliminate free inhibitors. Cells were then incubated at 4 °C with the HIV-1 isolate in the culture medium. One hour after incubation, cells were washed extensively with culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum to eliminate free unbound HIV particles, and the amount of p24 associated with cells was measured as an estimate for the amount of HIV binding. In order to demonstrate that most of the HIV associated with cells represented virus particles bound on the surface of cells, samples of cells incubated with virus were washed with PBS before treatment with trypsin to eliminate virus bound on the cell surface as described before (11Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Krust B. Franco R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For a control virus, we investigated the effect of HB-19 on the attachment of HIV-1 Ada, since HB-19 does not affect entry and infection by this virus isolate. Accordingly, HB-19 resulted in a significant inhibition of attachment of HIV-1 Lai and Ba-L but not Ada. To confirm the cell-surface expression of nucleolin, the subcellular localization of nucleolin was investigated by using a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb D3). Laser scanning confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Leica TCS4D) was carried out by fixing cells either with paraformaldehyde (PFA, 3.7%) for membrane staining or paraformaldehyde/Triton X-100 solution (PFA/Triton) for intracellular staining as described previously (35Weis K.

https://openalex.org/W2091737836,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A protein is phosphorylated by a cellular, serine/threonine kinase. To identify the major site(s) of NS5A phosphorylation, radiolabeled HCV-H NS5A phosphopeptides were purified and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis and Edman degradation. These data identified the major intracellular phosphorylation site in the HCV-H NS5A protein as Ser(2321), a result verified by two additional, independent methods: (i) substitution of Ala for Ser(2321) and the concomitant disappearance of the major in vivo phosphorylated peptides and corresponding in vitro phosphorylated peptides; and (ii) comigration of the digestion products of a synthetic peptide phosphorylated on Ser(2321) with the major in vivo phosphorylated NS5A peptides. Site-directed mutagenesis of Ser(2321) suggested that phosphorylation of NS5A is dispensable for previously described interactions with NS4A and PKR, a cellular, antiviral kinase that does not appear to catalyze NS5A phosphorylation. The proline-rich nature of the amino acid sequence flanking Ser(2321) (PLPPPRS(2321) PPVPPPR) suggests that a proline-directed kinase is responsible for the majority of HCV NS5A phosphorylation, consistent with previous kinase inhibitor studies."

We hypothesized that interaction between apoA-I and apoE contributed to the antiatherogenic properties of apoA-I, and therefore investigated whether apoA-I stimulated secretion of apoE by foam cell macrophages. Cholesterol enrichment of primary murine and human macrophages increased spontaneous apoE secretion 2-fold, as quantified by Western blot and chemiluminescence detection. Human apoA-I caused a further marked increase of apoE secretion from both murine (3.8-fold,p < 0.01) and human (3.2-fold, p = 0.01) foam cells in a time- and concentration- dependent manner, and this increase was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled macrophage apoE. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, but not the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, markedly inhibited apoE secretion to apoA-I (73.1 ± 9.8% inhibition at 4 h) and completely suppressed apoE secretion beyond 4 h. Pretreatment of macrophages with Pronase inhibited initial apoA-I-mediated apoE secretion by 70.5 ± 6.5% at 2 h, but by 8 h apoA-I-induced apoE secretion was the same in Pronase-pretreated and non-pretreated cells. Non-apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux induced by trimethyl-β cyclodextrin did not enhance apoE secretion, whereas phospholipid vesicles inducing the same degree of cholesterol efflux substantially enhanced apoE secretion, and apoA-I and phospholipid vesicles in combination demonstrated additive induction of apoE secretion. We conclude that apoA-I concurrently stimulates apoE secretion and cholesterol efflux from foam cell macrophages and that lipoprotein-derived apoA-I may enhance local secretion and accumulation of apoE in atherosclerotic lesions.

In transgenic mice matched for plasma lipoprotein concentrations, secretion of apoE in the artery wall is associated with a reduction in the extent of atherosclerosis (26Shimano H. Ohsuga J.

Interestingly, very recent studies have suggested that local macrophage apoE secretion may be proatherogenic (30Boisvert W.A. Curtiss L.K. J.

Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Clin.

ApoA-I and apoE are both proposed to have important lipid transfer activities in the central nervous system, and apoE is locally secreted during nerve degeneration and repair (34Ignatius M.J.

Anderson L.J. Kosik L.M. Pitas R. Weisgraber K.H. Hui D.H. Mahley R.W. Gebicke-Haerter P.J. Ignatius M.J. Shooter E.M. J. Clin.

A co-operative transfer of lipid from macrophages by apoA-I and its delivery to the remyelinating nerve via apoE was suggested, but a direct mechanism linking exogenous apoA-I and the secretion of apoE was not demonstrated. Similarly, a possible interaction between exogenous apoA-I and macrophage-secreted apoE has recently been hypothesized to inhibit atherogenesis in the vessel wallin vivo (37Boisvert W.A. Curtiss L.K. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 134 (Abstr. 4. p. 327): 365Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). We here demonstrate that there is a unifying mechanism for the co-localization and interaction of exogenous apoA-I and macrophage-secreted apoE, namely that apoA-I stimulates the secretion of apoE from foam cell macrophages. Primary murine and human macrophages secrete increased quantities of apoE in response to cholesterol loading, but, additionally, there is a further marked increase in secretion of apoE in response to incubation with human apoA-I. The apoE secreted in response to apoA-I is only partially derived from a preformed cell surface pool, most secreted apoE requiring de novo protein synthesis. The direct antiatherogenic effects of apoA-I may thus be augmented by the biological activities of locally secreted apoE.

Purified monocytes (>95% purity by nonspecific esterase staining) were differentiated by plating at a density of 1.5 × 106cells/22-mm2 culture dish (Costar) in RPMI 1640 containing antibiotics, glutamine (as above), and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated whole human serum for 9 days. Following differentiation, the cells were washed and incubated with RPMI 1640 containing 10% LPDS (v/v) and AcLDL (50 μg protein/ml) for 4 days to achieve cellular enrichment with FC and CE. In specified experiments, cells were pretreated with cycloheximide (2.0 μg/ml), actinomycin D (1.0 μg/ml), heparinase 1 (3 units/ml), and Pronase (10 μg/ml) after loading and before exposure to efflux medium as described in figure legends in order to investigate the respective importance of protein synthesis, mRNA transcription, cell surface proteoglycans, and cell surface proteins on apoE secretion. Cycloheximide and actinomycin D exposures were continued during efflux incubations, whereas Pronase and heparinase were removed and cells washed before incubation with efflux medium. The functional activity of heparinase preparations was separately confirmed for each preparation for each experiment by measuring the rate of formation of unsaturated β-uronides generated during the degradation of heparin, detected by absorbance at 232 nm (48Linker A. Hovingh P. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 902-911Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Macrophages that had been incubated with AcLDL (or control medium without AcLDL) for 24 h (MPM) or 96 h (HMDM), were washed in warm PBS and incubated for another 24 h in 1.0 ml of “efflux medium” comprising DMEM (MPM) or RPMI (HMDM) with or without apoA-I (0–25 μg/ml) as described (8Kritharides L.

To evaluate physicochemical cholesterol efflux, HMDM were incubated with AcLDL as above and then incubated in efflux medium comprising RPMI with 1.0 mg/ml hpβCD, 1.0 mg/ml tmβCD, or 20–400 μg/ml PLV for 24 h. (In comparative experiments, efflux media containing 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) resulted in cholesterol efflux, apoE secretion, and cell viability identical to that in media not containing BSA, but BSA was typically omitted in later experiments to avoid potential nonspecific binding of antibodies to BSA and potential contamination of media with apoE in BSA preparations.) At the end of this incubation, aliquots of medium were removed from each culture dish, gently mixed with Complete© protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and spun in an Eppendorf centrifuge (16,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) to remove any detached cells. Cell monolayers were washed three times in PBS and then lysed in 0.6 ml of cold PBS containing 2% SDS and Complete©protease inhibitor. Cell and media samples were then analyzed for lipid content and apoE content, and cell lysates were additionally analyzed for cell protein. Aliquots of cell suspensions and of efflux media were placed into separate glass Kimax tubes (Kimble, MA), made up to a final aqueous volume of 1.0 ml with ice-cold PBS containing butylated hydroxytoluene and EDTA, and the total extracted with methanol (2.5 ml) and then hexane (5 ml) as described (39Kritharides L. Jessup W. Gifford J. Dean R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). 4 ml of the hexane layer was evaporated to dryness, redissolved in mobile phase, and analyzed by HPLC as described below (39Kritharides L. Jessup W. Gifford J. Dean R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Separation of FC and CE (cholesteryl docosahexanoate, arachidonate, linoleate, oleate, and palmitate) was performed at room temperature on a C-18 column (25 × 0.46 cm length, 5 μm pore size, Supelco) by reverse phase HPLC with detection at 210 nm (39Kritharides L.

Acetonitrile/isopropanol/water (44/54/2, v/v/v) and acetonitrile/isopropanol (30/70, v/v), respectively, separated FC and CE, commercial standards of which (Sigma) confirmed elution times and 210 nm absorbance. Lipids within cell extracts and media were expressed as nmol/cell culture or nmol/mg cell protein. Where required, percentage of cholesterol efflux was calculated for each culture by expressing the cholesterol released into efflux medium as a percentage of the sum of cholesterol in the efflux medium and total cholesterol in the cell lysate at time of extraction (8Kritharides L. Jessup W. Mander E. Dean R.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Aliquots (40 μl) of cell culture medium were mixed with sample buffer (20 μl) containing 26.7 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 133 mm sucrose, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.67 mm EDTA, reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Cell lysates (already in SDS) were treated in an identical fashion except for the omission of SDS from the sample buffer. Samples were applied to a 4% stacking gel and 10% polyacrylamide resolving gel (50Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar), and run under reducing conditions in Tris-glycine buffer for 18 h at 75 V and compared with molecular weight marker protein. Electrophoretic Western blot transfer onto a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane was performed at 4 °C in Tris-glycine buffer for 1 h at 25–30 V, and subsequent blocking and washing steps were performed using Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20 and containing 1–5% skim milk powder. Following transfer, membranes were blocked, washed, and then incubated for 1.5 h with primary antibody to apoE (mouse anti-human monoclonal, 1:1000 dilution, Roche Molecular Biochemicals; or rabbit anti-mouse polyclonal, 1:5000 dilution, Biodesign International), before washing and incubating with 1:5000 dilution of secondary antibody (sheep anti-mouse IgG or donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Membranes were incubated with ECL Western blotting detection reagent, exposed to high performance chemiluminescence film (Hyperfilm©, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and resulting chemiluminescence signal was quantified using Bio-Rad Gel Doc 1000 Molecular Analyst Software. For HMDM, a serial dilution of authentic human apoE standard (Biodesign) in sample buffer was run to quantitate secreted apoE (micrograms per culture or per mg of cell protein). The linear response range of chemiluminescence signal to mass of authentic human apoE standard was defined for each Western blot for each experiment. For murine macrophages, data were calculated as arbitrary chemiluminescence units (AU) per cell culture or per mg of cell protein. In preliminary experiments it was confirmed that antibodies to human or murine apoE did not cross-react with apoA-I, and that antibodies to human apoA-I did not cross-react with murine or human apoE (data not shown). Plasma and macrophage samples from apoE KO mice were were confirmed to be apoE-deficient by Western blot. Mature, cholesterol-enriched HMDM and MPM were washed in methionine-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then incubated in methionine-free medium containing apoA-I and 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (1175 mCi/μmol, ICN) for 24 h at 37 °C. 200 μl aliquots of medium were removed at regular intervals as indicated, and HMDM and MPM media, respectively, immunoprecipitated using 1:10,000 dilution of polyclonal goat antibody to human apoE (Fitzgerald) or 1:5,000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit antibody to mouse apoE (Biodesign) and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE prior to quantification of the 34-kDa band of apoE by phosphorimaging (Photostimulated Luminescence, Fujix BAS 1000). Quantitative immunoprecipitation was confirmed in control experiments by analysis of residual supernatants after immunoprecipitation. Protein content of LDL samples and cell lysates was determined in duplicate or triplicate for each cell culture or each lipoprotein sample, and was measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Sigma) with BSA as standard (8Kritharides L. Jessup W. Mander E. Dean R.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 51Jessup W. Mander E.L. Dean R.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cell viability was routinely assessed by light microscopic morphology, by estimation of cell protein and by absence of cell staining with 0.5% (w/v) trypan blue (Trace Biosciences, Australia) after 2 min of incubation. Counting was performed from at least two high powered fields in representative dishes, and viability under various loading conditions was independently and routinely confirmed to be ≥95%. Additionally, in experiments using potential cytotoxins such as actinomycin D, lactate dehydrogenase assay was also used to confirm preserved cell viability compared with control conditions. A minimum of three separate incubations were performed for each condition in each experiment results for each experiment are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate cultures, and all experiments described are representative of several. Statistical comparisons used Student'st test for unpaired data using Mystat statistical software, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Where m"

Of the four isoforms of human PI3K that phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, only p110γ (or PI3Kγ) is associated with the regulatory subunit, p101, and is stimulated by G protein βγ heterodimers. We performed immunolocalization of transfected p110γ in HepG2 cells and found that, under resting conditions, p110γ was present in a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern, but translocated to the cell nucleus after serum stimulation. Serum-stimulated p110γ translocation was inhibited by pertussis toxin and could also be induced by overexpression of Gβγ in the absence of serum. In addition, we found that deletion of the amino-terminal 33 residues of p110γ had no effect on association with p101 or on its agonist-regulated translocation, but truncation of the amino-terminal 82 residues yielded a p110γ variant that did not associate with p101 and was constitutively localized in the nucleus. This finding implies that the intracellular localization of p110γ is regulated by p101 as well as Gβγ. The effect of PI3Kγ in the nucleus is an area of active investigation.

Phosphoinositide 3-kinases are a group of enzymes that phosphorylate the D-3 position of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol to produce phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI 1The abbreviations used are:PIphosphatidylinositolPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPAEporcine aortic endothelial1The abbreviations used are:PIphosphatidylinositolPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPAEporcine aortic endothelial-3-P), PI-3,4-P2, and PI-3,4,5-P3. After stimulation by growth factor- or G protein coupled-receptors, there is a transient increase in PI-3,4-P2 and PI-3,4,5-P3 (1Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The relatively larger pool of PI-3-P remains stable. Much of what is known about the role of PI3K in blood cells derives from the overexpression of PI3K mutants and the use of pharmacologic inhibitors such as wortmannin and LY294002. Studies have suggested that PI3K is involved in several aspects of signaling in hematopoietic cells: 1) cell proliferation, 2) chemotaxis, 3) histamine release from basophils, 3) phagocytosis by monocytes, 4) platelet aggregation, and 5) the respiratory burst of neutrophils (2Nakanishi S. Yano H. Matsuda Y. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).The four isoforms of human PI3K that phosphorylate PI, PI-4-P, and PI-4,5-P2 are classified by their catalytic subunits: p110α, p110β, p110γ, and p110δ. The most studied human PI3K is a heterodimer composed of p110α, p110β, or p110δ coupled to an adapter protein, p85. These p85-associated PI3K isoforms are tightly linked to signaling mediated by growth factor receptors. After stimulation by extracellular growth factors, the cytoplasmic tail of the growth factor receptor autophosphorylates, enabling it to associate with numerous signaling proteins, including p85, via its two SH2 domains. This recruits p110α to the cellular membrane, which appears to be sufficient to activate its lipid kinase activity (3Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.-A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The binding of activated Ras to p110α also appears capable of activating p85-p110, but whether this enhances its membrane association is currently unknown (4Kodaki T. Woscholski R. Hallberg B. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Downward J. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 798-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Intracellular localization studies have shown that p85-p110 is present in the cytoplasm with a small component at the extracellular membrane (3Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.-A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar); yet two studies using PC12 or human embryonic kidney 293 cells have suggested that p85-associated PI3K can translocate to the nucleus after neuronal growth factor stimulation (5Neri L.M. Milani D. Bertolaso L. Stroscio M. Bertagnolo V. Capitani S. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 40: 619-626PubMed Google Scholar) or H2O2 exposure (6Tanaka K. Horiguchi K. Yoshida T. Takeda M. Fujisawa H.

However, these observations remain controversial.Several years ago, it was shown that hematopoietic cells possess a PI3K that can be directly stimulated by Gβγ heterodimers (26Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweiss P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Several groups have demonstrated that this G protein-activated PI3K is a heterodimer composed of a catalytic subunit, p110γ, and an adapter protein, p101 (7Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T.

In addition to blood cells, Northern blot analysis demonstrated that p110γ mRNA is also abundant in skeletal and cardiac muscle, liver, and pancreas (9Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nürnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). This PI3K plays a role in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase by G protein-coupled receptors and Btk (10Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 11Li Z. Wahl M.I. Eguinoa A. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 94: 13820-13825Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In reconstitution assays, the p101-p110γ complex was inhibited by the pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein pleckstrin, whereas the p85-p110 complexes were unaffected (12Abrams C.S. Zhang J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25192-25197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The literature suggests that the regulation of p110α/β/δ catalytic subunits is controlled by their intracellular localization, which, in turn, is controlled by their p85-binding partners. In addition, several reports now provide evidence that p85-associated PI3K can translocate to the cell nucleus (5Neri L.M. Milani D. Bertolaso L. Stroscio M. Bertagnolo V. Capitani S. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 40: 619-626PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tanaka K. Horiguchi K. Yoshida T. Takeda M. Fujisawa H. Takeuchi K. Umeda M. Kato S. Ihara S. Nagata S. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3919-3922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, no published reports specifically address the intracellular localization of p101-p110γ. Therefore, in this study, we determined, first, the intracellular localization of p110γ and, second, whether the localization is influenced by binding to p101. Our results show that p110γ, upon serum stimulation, translocates to the cell nucleus. This serum-induced nuclear translocation is pertussis toxin-sensitive and can be mimicked by overexpression of Gβγ heterodimers, but does not appear to be cell cycle-regulated. However, the nuclear localization is regulated by p101 since the Δ1–82 truncation variant of p110γ, which cannot associate with p101, is constitutively localized in the nucleus.MATERIALS AND METHODSMammalian Expression VectorsThe cDNA clone of human p110γ was described previously (13Ma A.D. Metjian A. Bagrodia S. Taylor S. Abrams C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The p110γ variants were generated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis using the techniques of Ho et al. (14Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar) and Landt et al. (15Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Hahn U. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The deletion variants, p110γ (Δ1–34) and p110γ (Δ1–82), also contained the 5′-untranslated region from β-hemoglobin fused upstream of the initiator methionine. All of these cDNAs were cloned into pCMV5 and contain a carboxyl-terminal additional 9-amino acid hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) recognized by the monoclonal antibody 12CA5. The GFP-p110γ fusion-expressing plasmid contained the sequence for GFP in place of the stop codon and was generated by the technique of polymerase chain reaction splice overlap extension and cloned into pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The sequences of all clones were fully confirmed. The plasmids that direct the expression of an EE epitope (EEEEYMPME)-tagged variant of p101 and Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL)-tagged bovine p110γ were a generous gift from Dr. Len Stephens (Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Plasmids that direct the synthesis of Gβ1 and Gγ2 were a generous gift from Dr. Janet Robishaw (Geisinger Institute, Danville, PA).Co-immunoprecipitation StudiesCOS-7SH cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate technique as described previously (16Morris J.F. Madden S.L. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Sukatme V.P. Rauscher F.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2339-2348PubMed Google Scholar) using plasmids that direct the synthesis of HA-p110γ variants, with and without EE-p101 or Gβγ. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed on ice in 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 0.14 m NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1% aprotinin. After clarification at 13,000 ×g for 30 min, the supernatant was incubated with Sepharose G coupled to an anti-EE antibody (BAbCO, Berkeley, CA) overnight. The beads and associated proteins were pelleted at 2000 ×g for 30 s, washed extensively in the lysis buffer, and boiled in Laemmli loading buffer. The anti-EE immunoprecipitates were then fractionated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with the anti-HA antibody HA.11 (BAbCO) to detect the co-immunoprecipitation of HA-p110γ variants along with EE-p101.Indirect ImmunofluorescenceHepG2 cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate technique and stained as described previously (17Ma A.D. Brass L.F. Abrams C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Platelet-derived growth factor-transformed porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells were electroporated as described previously (18Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qui R.-G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Staining of cells with ethidium monoazide (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was performed following the manufacturer's protocol.MicroinjectionMicroinjection was performed using an Eppendorf 5171 Micromanipulator with an Eppendorf 5246 Transjector. Plasmid DNA was diluted in 2× injection buffer (100 mmHEPES (pH 7.2), 200 mm KCl, and 10 mmNaPO4) to a final concentration of 25 ng/μl. Transjector settings were injection pressure = 60 hectopascals, compensatory pressure = 20 hectopascals, and time of injection = 0.1 s. Cells were incubated for 6 h following injection and were then fixed in 10% neutral buffered Formalin for 30 min prior to image analysis. Two methods were used for image collection and analysis. Conventional fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon Microphot-SA microscope and camera. We also used the resources of the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center Confocal Microscopy Core Facility. Confocal images were acquired from a TCS 4D upright microscope and processed on an IBM OS9 workstation using Scanware software. All light microscopic figures were shot at ×40 magnification.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONp110γ Translocates to the Cell Nucleus of HepG2 Cells after Serum StimulationTo begin to understand the role of PI3Kγ in vivo, we performed indirect immunofluorescence of transfected p110γ in human HepG2 hepatoma cells. Liver cells naturally express PI3Kγ; therefore, we reasoned that HepG2 cells should contain any accessory proteins needed for proper p101-p110γ signaling. Since all available antibodies were unable to detect endogenous p110γ by immunofluorescence, we expressed the HA epitope-tagged p110γ that was recognized by the anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were placed in medium without serum for 16 h. The cells were then washed, fixed, and stained with an anti-HA antibody.As shown in Fig. 1 (A andB), when HepG2 cells were transfected with epitope-tagged p110γ and analyzed under serum-deprived conditions, the cells appeared large and flat. Under these resting conditions, indirect immunofluorescence showed that p110γ was present in a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern. In contrast, after stimulation of the cells with serum, immunolocalization of p110γ revealed that it was no longer detected in the cytoplasm, but was found almost exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 1, C and D). Confocal microscopy verified this finding and revealed that the transported PI3Kγ was diffusely present throughout the nucleus, but most concentrated at the nuclear membrane. Moreover, PI3Kγ staining did not coincide with simultaneous staining of the Golgi apparatus with the antibody G2404, a monoclonal antibody directed against the Golgi 58-kDa protein (data not shown). As has been reported previously, overexpression of PI3K did induce morphologic changes, including shrinking of the cytoplasm and ruffling of the cell membrane (5Neri L.M. Milani D. Bertolaso L. Stroscio M. Bertagnolo V. Capitani S. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 40: 619-626PubMed Google Scholar). Although cells overexpressing this protein had dramatic changes in their appearance, they were still viable. This was demonstrated by the exclusion of the DNA-staining agent ethidium monoazide in the absence of cell permeabilization. In addition, the cells did not show any evidence of apoptosis by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling immunofluorescence assay. Therefore, in response to serum stimulation, overexpressed p110γ induces dramatic morphologic changes and translocates to the nucleus.Overexpression of p101, which is endogenously present in HepG2 cells, had no influence on p110γ nuclear translocation and, under either resting or stimulated conditions, was present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (data not shown). We performed time course experiments to determine how rapidly after cell stimulation p110γ migrates to the nucleus. In these experiments, cells were transfected with plasmids encoding PI3Kγ. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were serum-deprived for an additional 16 h. At this point, all of the PI3Kγ protein was cytoplasmic. The medium was then changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and the time course of nuclear translocation was measured using the addition of serum as the defined time 0. These experiments showed that the translocation of p110γ began as rapidly as 2 h after serum exposure and was almost complete by 7 h, but maximal after ∼12 h. This time period is similar to the nuclear translocation seen with p110α in PC12 cells after stimulation with neuronal growth factor (5Neri L.M. Milani D. Bertolaso L. Stroscio M. Bertagnolo V.

To examine this issue, we preincubated cells with pertussis toxin to inhibit the release of Gβγ heterodimers from Gαi-coupled receptors. Cells were then examined in the presence or absence of serum stimulation. In the absence of serum, pertussis toxin did not affect the diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of p110γ in serum-starved cells (data not shown). However, pertussis-toxin inhibited the serum-induced p110γ nuclear translocation (Fig. 1, E and F). This suggests that the serum-induced nuclear translocation of PI3Kγ is dependent on a Gβγ-mediated signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to mimic serum-mediated nuclear translocation by overexpression of Gβγ heterodimers. The overexpression of Gβγ heterodimers resulted in the nuclear translocation of p101 even in the absence of serum stimulation (data not shown). As expected, pertussis toxin failed to alter the nuclear localization of p110γ induced by overexpression of Gβγ heterodimers (Fig. 1, Gand H). Together, these observations suggest that serum contains a factor that initiates the nuclear translocation of p110γ by causing release of Gβγ heterodimers downstream from a Gαi-coupled receptor.To confirm this Gβγ-mediated translocation of p110γ, a plasmid directing the expression of a chimeric protein composed of GFP fused to the carboxy terminus of p110γ was microinjected into HepG2 cells. Cells were analyzed 6 h after microinjection of the plasmid under serum-starved conditions. Similar to our observations with indirect immunofluorescence, under resting conditions, the GFP-p110γ fusion protein was found in a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern (Fig.2, A and C). In contrast, when plasmids that direct the expression of Gβγ heterodimers were simultaneously microinjected with the GFP-p110γ plasmid, the GFP fusion protein was exclusively localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2, B and D). Thus, in these cells, which endogenously express PI3Kγ, there is a Gβγ-mediated transport of this lipid kinase from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.Figure 2Effect of Gβγ on the nuclear translocation of GFP-p110γ. Serum-starved HepG2 cells were microinjected with plasmids directing the expression of GFP-p110γ with or without Gβγ. Six hours after microinjection, the cells were fixed and visualized by direct fluorescence images in A andB and phase plus immunofluorescence images in Cand D. A and C, cells microinjected with GFP-p110γ alone. The p110γ protein was present in a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern, with no p110γ visualized in the central dark nucleus. B and D, cells transfected with GFP-p110γ and Gβγ. Similar to the immunofluorescence studies shown in Fig. 1, the presence of Gβγ contributed to the translocation of GFP-p110γ to the cell nucleus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We questioned whether cell lines derived from tissues that do not endogenously contain PI3Kγ also contain the necessary accessory proteins for PI3Kγ nuclear translocation. As shown in Fig.3 A, when p101 and p110γ were transfected into stably platelet-derived growth factor-expressing PAE cells, staining for p110γ demonstrated that it was found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. In these platelet-derived growth factor-overexpressing cells, this pattern of distribution was independent of serum (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 (Band C), the intracellular localization was also independent of cell cycle as demonstrated by thymidine block (arresting cells at the G1/S boundary) or by thymidine block and release (arresting cells in S phase). In contrast, transfection of p101 and p110γ into COS-7SH cells demonstrated an exclusively cytoplasmic distribution for p110γ (data not shown). Together, this suggests that, like p101 and p110γ, the accessory proteins required for p110γ nuclear translocation are not ubiquitously expressed.Figure 3Effect of cell cycle on the intracellular localization of p110γ in PAE cells.Serum-starved PAE cells were electroporated. Plasmids directing the expression of p101 and p110γ and the cells were analyzed after thymidine block and release. Cells were analyzed after 48 h of 10% serum stimulation alone (A) or following thymidine block to arrest cells at G1/S (B) or following thymidine block and release to S phase arrest (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Studies of the Interaction between p110γ and p101There is some controversy in the literature regarding the necessity of the p101 subunit for p110γ function (7Stephens L.R.

We next sought to determine the role of p101 in the nuclear translocation of p110γ by examining the intracellular localization of a p110γ mutant unable to associate with p101. Since the interaction between p85 and p110α involves the amino terminus of p110α, we first tested whether p110γ variants lacking the amino terminus could associate with p101. To perform these experiments, we used a plasmid directing the expression of an EE epitope (EEEEYMPME)-tagged variant of p101, which allowed the immunoprecipitation of p101 along with its associated proteins with an anti-EE antibody. Full-length p110γ or deletion variants of p110γ were coexpressed with EE-p101 in COS-7SH cells. After lysis, p101 and its associated proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-EE antibody, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted with an anti-HA antibody. The anti-HA antibody recognizes the epitope added to all of the p110γ variants. As shown in Fig.4 (left panel), all of the variants coexpressed well with p101. In addition, full-length p110γ (wild type (WT)) and the 34-amino acid deletion variant (p110γ (Δ1–34)) both immunoprecipitated efficiently with p101 (Fig. 4, right panel). However, the variant that was missing the first 82 amino-terminal residues completely failed to immunoprecipitate with p101. This implies that a region of p110γ critical for association with p101 is located between residues 35 and 82 in p110γ.Figure 4Residues 1–82 in p110γ are required for interaction with p101. COS-7SH cells were transfected with HA epitope-tagged p110γ variants and EE epitope-tagged p101. Cells were lysed and immunoblotted with the anti-HA antibody 12CA5. As shown on the immunoblot of the total cell lysates, all three p110γ variants were expressed approximately equally, but only the wild type (WT) and Δ1–34 variant could co-immunoprecipitate with p101. This implies that the interaction for p101 requires residues 35 through 82.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Having identified a p110γ variant that did not associate with p101, we next tested whether this mutant translocated toward the nucleus in a fashion similar to wild-type p110γ. In contrast to the wild-type protein, p110γ (Δ1–82) was found in the nucleus even in the absence of serum (Fig. 5, Aand B). Overexpression of Gβγ heterodimers had no apparent influence on its intracellular localization (data not shown). This implies that p101 plays a role in the regulation of the intracellular localization of p110γ by retaining it in the cytoplasm in the absence of signals that initiate nuclear translocation. Consistent with this hypothesis, the p110γ-(Δ1–34) deletion variant, which does associate with p101, translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in an agonist-stimulated fashion similar to the wild-type protein (data not shown).Figure 5Intracellular localization of p110γ (Δ1–82).HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with HA epitope-tagged p110γ (Δ1–82) and analyzed by immunofluorescence with the 12CA5 antibody after 16 h of serum deprivation. Shown are the indirect (A) and phase plus (B) immunofluorescence images of two transfected cells. Deletion of the first 82 residues from p110γ induced it to localize in the cell nucleus in serum-deprived cells. This distribution is in contrast to the diffuse cytoplasmic localization of full-length p110γ in serum-starved cells (see Fig. 1,A and B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CONCLUSIONAlthough PI3Kγ has been well described as a mediator of signaling events at the plasma membrane, this work suggests that PI3Kγ may also play a role at the nuclear membrane. Specifically, we have shown that factors present in serum cause p110γ to move to the nucleus in transfected HepG2 cells. This response to serum can be inhibited by pertussis toxin and can be mimicked by overexpression of Gβγ heterodimers. A mutant form of p110γ that is unable to bind to p101 is constitutively localized in the nucleus.These observations raise a number of issues, including the mechanism by which PI3Kγ is transported to the nucleus, the impact of PI3Kγ on nuclear signaling, and whether these findings also apply to growth factor-activated p85-p110α/β. The mechanism by which PI3Kγ is translocated to the nucleus at this point is unclear. This process certainly can be regulated by the release of Gβγ heterodimers. Our studies suggest that p101 appears to regulate this translocation since a variant of p110γ that does not associate with p101 is constitutively found in the nucleus. This is similar to the mechanism by which mitogen-activated protein kinase shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm by alternatively interacting with cytoplasmic and nuclear retention (or anchoring) proteins (20Lenormand P. Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This model would imply sequences for nuclear import and retention, the existance and perhaps sequences for nuclear export and cytoplasmic retention within p110γ. Examination of the p110γ sequence reveals two potential nuclear import signals: R17RRRR and K806KKP. Since the p110γ-(Δ1–34) variant is capable of nuclear translocation, it implies that R17RRRR is not critical. Whether K806KKP is required for nuclear transport is currently unknown, as is the role of second messenger formation.The effect of PI3K on mitosis and survival is a topic of recent interest. Evidence derived from the use of inhibitors (or overexpressed effectors) of PI3K implies that a tight regulation of PI3K is critical for both cell growth and cell death. Most likely, this effect of PI3K is the result of an increase in lipid second messengers. Although cytoplasmic p101-p110γ will phosphorylate PI, PI-4-P, and PI-4,5-P2, only cytoplasmic PI-3,4-P2 and PI-3,4,5-P3 appear to change significantly after G protein-coupled receptor stimulation. Nuclear membranes, which probably contain the substrate for nuclear lipid kinases, contain abundant quantities of PI, PI-4-P, and PI-4,5-P2. But at this point, the substrate for PI3Kγ in the nucleus remains to be determined. It has long been appreciated that individual phospholipid concentrations vary with the cell cycle. For example, Dobos et al. (21Dobos G.J. Wu X.R. Traynor-Kaplan A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PI-3-P is elevated during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Recently, it has also been"

Cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.mEH cDNA/pBSK ConstructThe cDNA for mEH was prepared from rat liver poly(A)+ mRNA using reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction procedure (26Kawasaki E.S. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1990Google Scholar). The 5′ primer used, ATGCGTCGACGGCACTTCTGTTCCCAGGGAAA, was targeted to the cDNA sequence 85–106 and contained anSalI site (underlined). The 3′ antisense primer used, AAGCGGTACCCTTCCATAAGTGTGACTTGGGAGG, was targeted to nucleotide 1582–1559 and contained a KpnI site (underlined). The polymerase chain reaction product was digested withSalI and KpnI and cloned into the vector pRSV. The mEH cDNA was then isolated as anSalI/EcoRI (linker site) fragment and inserted into pBSK (Bluescript/Stratagene) digested with SalI andEcoRI. The fidelity of the cDNA was verified by restriction enzyme mapping and by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy termination method (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Preparation of the mEH/P-glycoprotein Fragment Chimeric cDNA Construct (mEH/Pgpf)In this construct, a Pgp cDNAPstI(nt 1314)/HindII(nt 2033) fragment containing amino acid residues 394–678 (28Endicott J.A. Sarangi F. Ling V. DNA Seq. 1991; 2: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was attached to the 3′ end of the mEH coding sequence through the PstI site at the mEH cDNA nt 1513, in a three-way ligation: mEHXhoI(linker)/PstI fragment, plus the PgpPstI/HindIII fragment, and the mEH/pBSK construct in which the XhoI/HindIII fragment had been removed as shown in Fig. 1 A. The resulting construct encoded the entire mEH polypeptide (455 amino acids), followed by a Pgp polypeptide tail (Pgp amino acid 439 to 678), which contained a glycosylation site at position 491, followed by the last 15 amino acids (440 to 455) of mEH. These terminal 15 amino acids thus appeared twice in the chimeric protein in both the mEH portion and again at the C terminus of the chimeric protein. The mEH termination codon following the last 15 amino acids was used to terminate the translation of the chimeric polypeptide. To modify the net charge at the N terminus of the chimeric cDNA, the XhoI/EcoRV(983) fragment of the chimeric construct was replaced with aXhoI/EcoRV fragment isolated from the mEHg/(+3) cDNA, which contained the engineered positive charge additions as described below.In Vitro Transcription/Translation of mEH and mEH DerivativesThe expression of mEH and mEH derivatives was investigated by in vitro transcription/translation with the various mEH cDNA constructs inserted in pBSK. These constructs were linearized by EcoRI digestion and in vitrotranscribed with T3 RNA polymerase (Ambion/MEGAscript T3 kit). The resultant mEH mRNA (1 μg) was then translated in vitro with the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) using conditions recommended by the manufacturer in the presence and absence of canine microsomal membranes (Promega). [35S]methionine (40 μCi) was included to radiolabel newly synthesized protein. The effect of the glycosylation inhibitor tripeptide Asn-Tyr-Thr (NYT) on the synthesis of mEH derivatives containing an introduced glycosylation site was evaluated as described previously (29Geetha-Habib M. Park H.R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13655-13660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The translated products were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and visualized by autoradiography.Addition of an Internal Glycosylation SiteA glycosylation site (Asn-Gly-Thr) was introduced near the C terminus of mEH (mEHg) by replacing the wild type Phe-Ala-Ala (residue 432–434, Fig. 2). The mutations were made by replacing the wild typeSphI/HindIII fragment (nt 1370 to 1463) with a synthesized mutant SphI/HindIII fragment. To prepare this mutant fragment, two oligonucleotides were synthesized: TCCGAGCTACTGCATGCCCCAGAAAAGTGGGTGAAGGTCAAGTACCCCAAACTCATCTCCTATTCCTAC(oligonucleotide f in Fig. 1 B in sense sequence, nucleotide 1354 to 1423; the SphI site is underlined) and CTGGGCCAGAAGCTTGGGCTCTTCAAAGGTACCATTGTGGCCCCCACGTTCCATGTAGGAATAGGAGAT(oligonucleotide g in Fig. 1 B in antisense sequence, nucleotide 1477 to 1408; mutated nucleotides are in bold face. The HindIII site AAGCTT and the mutation-created siteKpnI GGATCC are underlined). These two oligonucleotides were annealed to each other through the complementary 15 nucleotides (shown in italics) and were extended to full-length double-stranded DNA with Klenow large fragment of DNA polymerase 1. The extended DNA fragment was digested with restriction enzymes SphI andHindIII and inserted into a mEH/pBSK construct in which the wild type SphI/HindII fragment had been removed. The authenticity of the construct (mEHg/pBSK) was confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping (the intactness of the SphI andHindIII sites, the appearance of the new KpnI site and the length of the mutated SphI/HindIII fragment as compared with the wild type) and by DNA sequencing. For transfection into COS-7 cells, the mutant cDNA insert was isolated from the pBSK construct as a XhoI/XbaI fragment and inserted into the pcDNA1.1/Amp vector (Invitrogen) digested with XhoI and XbaI.Figure 2Amino acid sequences of N-terminal and C-terminal domains of mEH and mEH derivatives.

Four different mutant oligonucleotides in sense sequence (Fig. 1 B,a–d, corresponding to cDNA nucleotide 124 to 180 in position) were separately annealed to a common antisense oligonucleotide e (nucleotide 223 to 165) through the complementary 15-nucleotide sequence and extended into full-length double-stranded DNA fragments by Klenow large fragment. These fragments were then digested with PstI and SmaI and inserted into wild type mEH/pBSK construct in which thePstI/SmaI fragment had been removed. To add the glycosylation site to these charge-modified mEH cDNAs, the wild type SalI (at the 5′ end of the cDNA)/EcoRV(nt 983) fragment in the mEHg/pBSK construct was replaced by the mutant SalI/EcoRV fragments isolated from the four charge-modified pBSK constructs. The Glu to Gly substitution at position 4 was effected with oligonucleotidesa and e (Fig. 1 B) resulting in mEHg(+1)a. The oligonucleotide a sequence ACCTCCCTGCTGCAGTCAGGAGTCATGTGGCTAGGCCTTGTCCTGGCTTCCCTTCTGcontained the PstI site and created a StuI site AGGCCT (underlined) where the altered nucleotides are in bold face. The 15-nucleotide sequence (in italics) is complementary to the 15-nucleotide sequence in oligonucleotide e (in italics). The Trp to Arg substitution at position 2 was effected with oligonucleotides b and e (Fig. 1 B) resulting in mEHg(+1)b. The oligonucleotide b sequence ACCTCCCTGCTGCAGTCAGGAGTCATGCGGCTGGAGCTCGTCCTGGCTTCCCTTCTGcontained the PstI site and created a SacI site GAGCTC (underlined). The Glu to Lys substitution at position 4 was effected with oligonucleotides c and e (Fig.1 B) yielding mEHg(+2). The oligonucleotide csequence: ACCTCCCTGCTGCAGTCAGGAGTCATGTGGCTTAAGCTTGTCCTGGCTTCCCTTCTGcontained the PstI site and created anAflII site CTTAAG (underlined). The Trp to Arg substitution at position 2 and the Glu to Lys substitution at position 4 was effected with oligonucleotides d and e (Fig.1 B) resulting in mEHg(+3). The oligonucleotide dsequence ACCTCCCTGCTGCAGTCAGGAGTCATGCGGCTGAAGCTTGTCCTGGCTTCCCTTCTGcontained the PstI site and created a HindIII site AGGCCT (underlined). The common antisense oligonucleotidee sequence TCCTCCTTGTCCCGGGAGACAAACCAGTAGTGACAAAGCCCAGAAGGGAAGCCAGGcontained the SmaI site (underlined). The authenticity of the mutant constructs was confirmed by (a) restriction enzyme mapping, which demonstrated intact PstI and SmaI sites; (b) the appearance of the new restriction sites specific for each mutation; (c) the same length of the mutant PstI/SmaI fragment when compared with the wild type; and (d) by DNA sequencing. The pBSK constructs were directly used for in vitrotranscription-translation experiments. For transfection into COS-7 cells, the mutant cDNA inserts were isolated from the pBSK constructs as XhoI/XbaI fragments and inserted into the pcDNA1.1/Amp vector digested with XhoI andXbaI.Deletion of the N-terminal Transmembrane DomainThis deletion was made by replacing a wild type fragment with a synthesized short PstI/SmaI fragment in the mEH/pBSK construct (Fig. 1 B). 5′GTCAGGAGTCATGTCCC3′3′ACGTCAGTCCTCAGTACAGGG5′ SEQUENCE1This DNA fragment was formed by annealing two oligonucleotides together (Fig. 1 B, oligonucleotides h andi). It contained a PstI sticky end on the left and a SmaI blunt half-site on the right and an ATG translation start codon (bold phase). The codon TCC corresponded to the Ser codon at residue 20 of the wild type mEH polypeptide. Thus, this replacement links the ATG codon directly to residue 20, deleting residues 2 to 19. This truncated cDNA is designated mEHt. Confirmation of the sequence change and transfer of the mutant cDNA insert from the pBSK construct to pcDNA1.1/Amp vector was performed as described above.Western Blot AnalysisWestern analyses were performed using a polyclonal antibody against mEH and the ProtoBlot alkaline phosphatase detection system (Promega).Cell Surface BiotinylationThe expression of mEH and mEH derivatives on the plasma membrane of COS-7 cells was established using a cell surface biotinylation labeling procedure with sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Sulfo-NHS-Biotin) (Pierce) on transfected and untransfected cells as described previously (17Amarneh B.A. Simpson E.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 119: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The labeled surface proteins were isolated using avidin-agarose beads, and mEH and the mEH derivatives were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. To establish that the reagent labeled only cell surface protein, the biotinylation of the cytoplasmic protein, Hsp 70 was also determined using an anti-Hsp 72/23 monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (21Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27228-27234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, COS-7 cells were disrupted by suspending in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (1 ml), frozen and thawed (2×) and homogenized with 100 strokes in a tight Dounce homogenizer. The soluble fraction isolated by centrifugation was biotinylated as described for intact cells. Following biotinylation, the excess reagent was removed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline for 24 h, and the resultant protein was treated as described for intact cells and the biotinylated Hsp 70 determined as described above.Deglycosylation of mEH DerivativesGlycosylated forms of mEH derived from the COS-7 cell plasma membrane or directly from the microsome fraction were deglycosylated with Endo Hf (New England Biolabs) using procedures supplied by the manufacturer. Proteins were then detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.Inhibition of the Glycosylation Reaction by the Tripeptide NYTThe tripeptide Asn-Tyr-Thr, with both the N and C termini blocked as acetyl-Asn-Tyr-Thr-amide, has been shown to be an effective substrate for oligosaccharyl transferase (29Geetha-Habib M. Park H.R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13655-13660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to inhibit glycosylation reactions in vitro (30Welply J.K. Shenbagamurthi P. Lennarz W.J. Naider F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11856-11863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This tripeptide was kindly provided by Dr. R. A. F. Reithmeier (University of Toronto, Canada) and was included in the in vitrotranslation mixture at a final concentration of 46 μm to inhibit the in vitro glycosylation reaction of the mEHg(+3) derivative.Proteinase K DigestionAfter in vitrotranslation, proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, followed by incubation at 0 °C for 60 min as recommended by Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was then added to a final concentration of 4 mm to stop the digestion before the reaction product was analyzed with SDS-PAGE.Confocal Immunofluorescence Analysis of Transfected COS-7 CellsCOS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA for mEH, mEHg(0), mEHg(+3), and mEHt were incubated with anti-mEH monoclonal antibody, mAb 25D-1 (1 μg/ml) for 18 h at 4 °C, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde before incubation with a secondary antibody, cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 4 h at 24 °C. Antibody labeling was characterized by cy3 epifluorescence using a Zeiss LSM-210 scanning confocal microscope equipped with a barrier filter. Image analysis was performed using the standard system operating software.RESULTSAddition of an N-Glycosylation Site and N-terminal Charge Modification of mEHThe membrane topology of mEH was characterized by the introduction of N-glycosylation sites into two different loci of mEH, which itself lacks such sites, to establish whether a particular protein domain is expressed in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. A fragment of P-glycoprotein (Pgpf) (amino acids 394–678) containing a potential glycosylation site at amino acid 439 (28Endicott J.A. Sarangi F. Ling V. DNA Seq. 1991; 2: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which has been used to study the topology of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (19Chen M. Zhang J.T. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1996; 13: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), has been linked to mEH at position 454 as shown in Fig.1 A. A glycosylation site was also directly introduced into full-length mEH at position 432 by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1 B) resulting in the conversion of Phe-Ala-Ala to Asn-Gly-Thr (Fig.2). In addition, the net charge of the N-terminal end preceding the 16-residue hydrophobic domain was modified over a range of 0 to +3 as shown in Fig. 2 to investigate the role of charge in regulating mEH insertion into the ER membrane in vitro and COS cell expression systems, and also to define the topological form of mEH that is targeted to the plasma membrane.In Vitro Translation of mEH and mEH DerivativesThe various mEH constructs in pBSK were in vitro transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase and then translated with the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence and absence of canine pancreas microsomes. The mEH(0)/Pgpf chimera containing a glycosylation site was translated yielding a peptide with the expected molecular mass (80.7 kDa). However, in the presence of microsomes no glycosylated higher molecular weight species was observed indicating that an undetectable amount of the Pgpf tail on mEH was located in the ER lumen, thus suggesting primarily a type I topology in the ER (Fig.3 A, lanes 1 and2). A mEH derivative in which Trp (position 2) was converted to Arg, and Glu (position 4) was converted to Lys, which results in the alteration of the net N-terminal charge from 0 to +3 (Fig. 2), was then coupled to Pgpf and expressed in the cell-free system. In the absence of microsomes, a single band was observed that had the same mobility as the chimera composed of mEH(0)/Pgpf (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). In the presence of microsomes, however, two bands were observed, indicating that approximately 40% of the expressed protein was glycosylated, and suggesting that the glycosylation site must be partially located in the lumen (Fig. 3 A, lane 4).Figure 3In vitro expression of mEH and mEH derivatives containing an introduced glycosylation site. A, the mEH-Pgpf chimeras with a glycosylation site at position 491 in Pgpf as shown in Fig. 1 with N-terminal net charges of 0 or +3, were translated with [35S]methionine in a cell free system in the presence (+) and absence (−) of dog pancreas microsomes (M). The total expressed protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography with 25 μl applied to lanes 1-4. B, mEH and mEHg derivatives with a glycosylation site at position 431 with N-terminal net charges of 0 or +3, were translated in a cell free system in the presence (+) and absence (−) of dog pancreatic microsomes (M), with the effect of the glycosylation inhibitor, NYT, and proteinase K (PK) digestion on product formation also evaluated. The total expressed protein was analyzed as in panel A, applying 25 μl of the reaction mixture to lanes 1-8.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Full-length mEH was also expressed in vitro and shown by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography to have the correct molecular weight (Fig.3 B, lane 1) and to react with an anti-mEH antibody (25D-1) (data not shown). When mEH with a glycosylation site introduced at position 432 (mEHg(0)) was expressed in the in vitro system, only one band was observed in the presence or absence of microsomes, with a mobility identical to unmodified mEH (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 3) indicating that the glycosylation site was located outside of the ER lumen and that the protein primarily adopted a type I orientation. When the mEHg(+3) derivative (Fig. 2) was expressed in the absence of microsome, a single band was observed (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). However, as observed for the mEH(+3)/Pgpf derivative, in the presence of microsomes, two bands were formed (Fig. 3 B, lane 5) suggesting that approximately 55% of the translated protein was oriented with the glycosylation site in the ER lumen. This conclusion was supported by the observation that the formation of the upper band was significantly inhibited (Fig. 3 B, lane 6) by the glycosylation tripeptide inhibitor Asn-Tyr-Thr (30Welply J.K. Shenbagamurthi P. Lennarz W.J. Naider F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11856-11863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, mEHg(+3) was"

We find that a construct encoding the first two Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of the Src homology 2/SH3 adaptor protein Nck can activate c-Abl in human 293T cells. A myristoylated Nck SH3 domain construct, which is expected to localize to membranes, potently activated Abl when expressed at low levels. An unmyristoylated Nck SH3 domain construct, which localizes to the cytosol and nucleus, also activated Abl but only at high levels of expression. Activation by both myristoylated and unmyristoylated Nck constructs required the C terminus of Abl; a C-terminally truncated form of Abl was not activated, although this construct could still be activated by deletion of its SH3 domain. Activation did not require the major binding sites in the Abl C terminus for Nck SH3 domains, however, suggesting that the mechanism of activation does not require direct binding to the C terminus. Activation of c-Abl by Nck SH3 domains provides a robust experimental system for analyzing the mechanisms that normally repress Abl activity and how that normal regulation can be perturbed.

Activation of c-Abl by Nck SH3 domains provides a robust experimental system for analyzing the mechanisms that normally repress Abl activity and how that normal regulation can be perturbed. The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl has been extensively studied, yet its regulation and mechanism of activation are poorly understood. Originally identified as the transforming gene of Abelson murine leukemia virus (1Goff S.P. Gilboa E. Witte O.N. Baltimore D. Cell. 1980; 22: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), Abl has also been implicated in human leukemia via a specific chromosomal translocation that generates a fusion protein containing c-Abl and N-terminal sequences derived from a second locus, Bcr (2Shtivelman E. Lifshitz B. Gale R.P. Canaani E. Nature. 1985; 315: 550-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar, 3Mes-Masson A.-M. McLaughlin J. Daley G.Q. Paskind M. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9768-9772Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Overexpressed c-Abl is catalytically inactive, nontransforming, localized predominantly in the nucleus, and lacks detectable tyrosine phosphorylation; on the contrary, various mutant forms of Abl have increased kinase activity, can transform fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells, are highly tyrosine-phosphorylated, and are localized predominantly in the cytosol and on membranes (for review see Ref. 4Raitano A.B. Whang Y.E. Sawyers C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F201-F216PubMed Google Scholar). This dramatic difference in biological activity suggests that c-Abl is tightly regulated in vivo. The nonreceptor tyrosine kinases whose regulation is best understood are the members of the Src family. Src and its relatives are regulated by a C-terminal tyrosine residue that, when phosphorylated, can bind in cis to the SH2 1The abbreviations used are:SH2Src homology domain 2SH3Src homology domain 3WTwild typeHAhemagglutinin domain of the kinase, effectively locking it in an inactive form (for review see Ref.5Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). This inactive or “closed” conformation is stabilized by interaction of the SH3 domain of Src with a linker region between its SH2 and kinase domains (6Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 7Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). When the regulatory tyrosine is dephosphorylated, the closed conformation is unstable, the kinase domain is unleashed, and Src exhibits full kinase activity. Binding of a high-affinity ligand to the Src SH3 domain can also destabilize the closed conformation by displacing the intramolecular SH3-linker interaction (8Moarefi I. LeFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Src homology domain 2 Src homology domain 3 wild type hemagglutinin Because c-Abl closely resembles c-Src in domain structure (with the exception of the long C-terminal extension that defines the Abl family of kinases) it is reasonable to suppose that it is regulated in a similar fashion. However, several pieces of evidence suggest that this is not the case. Under most conditions c-Abl is not detectably phosphorylated on tyrosine, inconsistent with an intramolecular SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction (9Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Clark R.

Instead, the SH3 domain of c-Abl appears to play a more critical role in regulation, because mutations in the SH3 domain potently activate the transforming activity of c-Abl (11Franz W.M. Berger P. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 12Jackson P. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 13Van Etten R.A. Debnath J. Zhou H. Casasnovas J.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1977-1988PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study (14Barilá D. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) suggests that the negative regulation of Abl might be dominated by an intramolecular SH3-linker interaction similar to that seen in the Src structure. However, purified WT c-Abl kinase prepared from baculovirus has identical specific activity to an SH3-deleted, activated Abl mutant, inconsistent with intramolecular interactions being entirely responsible for negative regulation (15Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2883-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). 2B. J. Mayer, unpublished results. It has been proposed that Abl is regulated at least in part by a titratable SH3-binding cellular inhibitor (9Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Clark R. McCormick F. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5927-5931Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and several candidate inhibitors have been identified (16Zhu J. Shore S.K. Mol. Cell.

The activity of endogenous c-Abl has been shown to be regulated by several different conditions and factors, most notably DNA damage (20Liu Z.-G. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M.

Although these studies have shed some light on the potentialin vivo role of c-Abl, the low expression level of endogenous Abl and modest levels of activation (typically 2–4-fold) have made it difficult to study the mechanism of regulation. Toward this end, a robust system in which the activation of overexpressed c-Abl and its mutants can be experimentally manipulated would be extremely useful. Among the large number of proteins and factors that have been shown to interact with c-Abl are the SH2/SH3 adaptor proteins Grb2, Crk, and Nck, which bind via their SH3 domains to proline-rich sites in the Abl C terminus (28Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 29Ren R. Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The role of these adaptors is not firmly established, but binding of the Crk adaptor has been shown to affect the processivity of Abl toward some substrates, presumably by forming a tight complex via its SH2 domain with those substrates when they are phosphorylated (30Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The Nck adaptor consists of three SH3 domains and one SH2 domain (31Lehman J.M. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Its SH2 domain binds a variety of phosphorylated proteins such as receptor tyrosine kinases, IRS-1, and focal adhesion components (32Lee C.-H. Li W. Nishimura R. Zhou M. Batzer A.G. Myers J.

Nck is itself tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to many stimuli (33Li W. Hu E. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell.

Akiyama, unpublished observation. hence many possible interactions can be mediated by Nck. Although the interaction between Abl and Nck was suggested several years ago (29Ren R. Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), recent data have led to new insights into their relationship. The Xenopus Arg protein (which is highly related to Abl) (38Kruh G.D. Perego R. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5802-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) emerged from a screen of Xenopusproteins that bind specifically to the first two SH3 domains of Nck, and microinjection data suggest that Abl and Arg are effectors for the ability of Nck mutants to induce mesoderm patterning defects in early embryos. 4C. Adler, T. Akiyama, J. M. Smith, and B. J. Mayer, manuscript in preparation. OtherXenopus experiments demonstrated that localization of the first two SH3 domains of Nck to membranes (mimicking the relocalization of full-length Nck to sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on the membrane) induced strong mesoderm patterning effects (39Tanaka M. Lu W. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4493-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here we report that expression of Nck SH3 domains can activate Abl in human 293T cells. These experiments establish a model system that will facilitate delineation of the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of Abl. All Abl genes are derived from mouse type IV c-Abl (12Jackson P. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 40Ben-Neriah Y. Bernards A. Paskind M. Daley G.Q. Baltimore D.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2883-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The c-Abl construct that we use here encodes authentic WT c-Abl and does not include linkers 5′ to the SH3 domain or 3′ to the SH2 domain as in earlier versions (15Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2883-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The “SF” and “SG” constructs both encode a stop codon following Arg-532 (immediately C-terminal to the catalytic domain). The AblΔPro mutant was generated by two-step polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and contains a deletion (amino acids 536–645) encompassing the proline-rich adaptor binding region as well as the major nuclear localization signal (41Van Etten R.A.

The generation of constructs expressing myristoylated and unmyristoylated Nck SH3 domains has been described (39Tanaka M. Lu W. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Nck “PA” mutant was generated by polymerase chain reaction and contains a point mutation that changes proline 84 to alanine, eliminating the conserved potential SH3-binding site. All Nck constructs are derived from human Nck (31Lehman J.M. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), tagged with the influenza virus HA epitope at their C termini, and expressed in the pEBB mammalian expression vector (39Tanaka M.

Transfection of 293T cells was by the calcium phosphate method as described (44Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed 24–48 h post-transfection in 1 ml of kinase lysis buffer (25 mmTris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μl/ml aprotinin solution (Sigma)). The protein content of lysates was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting of whole cell lysates was as described (15Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2883-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: for Abl, monoclonals 8E9 (PharMingen International) and 24–21 (kindly provided by A. Pendergast); monoclonal HA11 to detect Nck constructs (Berkeley Antibody Co.); monoclonal antibodies 4G10 (Upstate Biochemical, Inc.) and PY20(45) for anti-phosphotyrosine blotting. For immunoprecipitation, lysate from one-tenth of a 10-cm dish was pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), then incubated on ice with 1 μg of anti-Abl antibody K12 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Immune complexes were collected on protein A beads, washed three times in lysis buffer, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting as above. Our previous results indicated that c-Abl interacts with the first two SH3 domains of Nck, suggesting that Nck might affect Abl activity by changing its localization or binding partners. Nck has the potential to bind via its SH2 domain to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (for example in focal adhesions), and thereby serve to relocalize Abl in response to extracellular signals. Most tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are associated with membranes, so we reasoned that fusion of the two N-terminal SH3 domains of Nck to a membrane targeting signal (the Src myristoylation sequence) might mimic endogenous signals and thus modulate Abl activity. We therefore tested whether a myristoylated form of the first two SH3 domains of Nck (Myr 1+2) or the unmyristoylated form (1+2) (depicted in Fig. 1) could affect the activity of overexpressed c-Abl in transiently transfected 293T cells. Preliminary experiments suggested that effects of Nck SH3 domains might be concentration-dependent, so a wide range of plasmid amounts (from 25 ng to 8 μg) was tested for each Nck construct. The in vivo activity of Abl was assayed indirectly by the presence of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in total cell extracts. Both myristoylated and unmyristoylated SH3–1+2 induced a dramatic increase in cellular phosphotyrosine, not only in Abl itself but also in a variety of other cellular proteins (Fig.2). Autophosphorylation of c-Abl has historically been used as a read-out for Abl activation (9Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Clark R. McCormick F. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5927-5931Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 11Franz W.M. Berger P. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in transfected cell lysates of approximately 150-kDa molecular mass was Abl itself (data not shown). These results indicate that Nck SH3 domains can activate the normally repressed c-Abl kinase. A myristoylated SH3–1+2 construct in which the binding activity of the two SH3 domains was ablated by site-directed mutation did not activate Abl (data not shown), indicating that ligand binding is required. Although both Myr 1+2 and the unmyristoylated version activated Abl, the concentration dependence of the two was very different. In the case of Myr 1+2, maximal activation was achieved with 100–250 ng and quickly tapered off at increasing concentrations (Fig. 2). At these higher concentrations of Myr 1+2, a decrease in the total amount of Abl was usually observed, suggesting feedback regulation at the level of protein synthesis or degradation. Activation by the unmyristoylated 1+2 occurred only with very high amounts, typically requiring 10–50-fold more plasmid than the myristoylated version to activate to a comparable level (Fig. 2). The concentration-dependent activation of Abl was highly reproducible, although the amount of Nck plasmid required for maximal activation and the absolute level of Abl activation varied somewhat from experiment to experiment, most likely because of differences in transfection efficiency. The Nck 1+2 constructs were themselves tyrosine-phosphorylated, with the extent of phosphorylation correlating with Abl activity (data not shown). In similar co-transfection experiments, we also observed activation of the Abl-related kinase Arg-1B (38Kruh G.D. Perego R. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5802-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) by both myristoylated and unmyristoylated SH3–1+2 (data not shown). As expected from the increase in in vivo Abl activity, there was a modest increase in the in vitro kinase activity of Abl immunoprecipitated from lysates of cells expressing low amounts of Myr 1+2 or high amounts of 1+2 compared with those expressing Abl alone (data not shown). When Nck SH3–1+2 constructs were transfected alone we did not observe significant increases in total cell phosphotyrosine or in the tyrosine phosphorylation orin vitro kinase activity of endogenous Abl; activation of endogenous Abl in these experiments would be difficult to detect, however, because of background from untransfected cells. To gain insight into the mechanism of activation, the domains of Abl necessary for activation by either myristoylated or unmyristoylated SH3–1+2 were investigated. The Abl constructs tested are depicted in Fig. 1. SF-Abl encodes a c-Abl protein that is truncated immediately C-terminal to the catalytic domain and is therefore lacking the known adaptor-binding sites in addition to a variety of other protein-binding sites and the nuclear localization and nuclear export signals (4Raitano A.B. Whang Y.E. Sawyers C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F201-F216PubMed Google Scholar, 28Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H.

S. A. 1998; 95: 7457-7462Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). G-Abl is an SH3-deleted form of c-Abl, which has previously been shown to be constitutively active in vivo and transforming (15Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2883-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and SG-Abl is a form of G-Abl containing the identical C-terminal truncation to SF-Abl. SG-Abl is transforming in fibroblasts (though focus formation is decreased approximately 10-fold relative to full-length G-Abl), whereas SF-Abl is nontransforming, indicating that C-terminal truncation does not abrogate the SH3-mediated repression of Abl activity.2 As shown in Fig. 3, neither Myr 1+2 nor 1+2 had a significant effect on the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by SF-Abl, G-Abl, or SG-Abl over a wide range of concentrations. The phosphotyrosine levels in the SF-Abl blot remain steady and equivalent to the negative control, whereas under identical conditions WT c-Abl was clearly activated (Fig. 3 A, comparelanes 3 and 7). The lack of activation of the SF mutant demonstrates that the C terminus contains sequences required for activation by Nck SH3 domains. As expected, tyrosine phosphorylation levels in cells expressing the transforming mutants G-Abl and SG-Abl were high relative to controls; they were not significantly affected, however, by the presence of Myr 1+2 or 1+2. A slight increase in phosphotyrosine in cells expressing Nck SH3 domains and G-Abl or SG-Abl was occasionally observed (Fig. 3, B and C), but this was modest and inconsistent unlike the robust activation seen in the case of WT c-Abl. The inability of Nck SH3 domains to further enhance the activity of mutagenically activated Abl suggests that its effects are not because of some general mechanism affecting phosphotyrosine metabolism, such as inhibition of phosphatase activity in the cell. It can also be seen that Nck SH3 domains elevate thein vivo activity of c-Abl to a level comparable with that of transforming mutants such as G-Abl (Fig. 3 B, comparelanes 3 and 4). The lack of activation of the C-terminally truncated SF-Abl mutant suggested that direct interaction between the Nck SH3 domains and the Abl C terminus might be involved in activation. Immediately following the catalytic region of c-Abl is a proline-rich region that has been previously shown to contain binding sites for the Crk, Grb2, and Nck SH3 domains (28Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 29Ren R. Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 30Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that this region contains the major binding sites for Nck SH3–1+2 in vitro.4 We therefore generated a construct (AblΔPro) to address whether the high affinity binding site for Nck SH3 domains is necessary to mediate Abl activation (Fig. 1). Plasmids encoding c-Abl and the AblΔPro mutant were co-transfected with increasing amounts of Myr 1+2, and activity was assayed by immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies as above. Surprisingly, AblΔPro was activated by Myr 1+2 to a similar extent and with similar concentration dependence as WT c-Abl (Fig.4). A more precise mutant that eliminates the high-affinity Nck-binding site but does not affect the Crk-binding site or major nuclear localization signal was also activated to a similar extent (data not shown). Although activation levels of either c-Abl or AblΔPro were similar, the association of Myr 1+2 with AblΔPro was much weaker than with WT c-Abl as detected by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5).Figure 5Immunoprecipitation of Abl and Nck constructs. 4 μg of plasmid expressing WT Abl or AblΔPro mutant was transfected with 1.6 μg of plasmid expressing Myr 1+2 or the Myr 1+2 PA mutant. 100 μl of lysate was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of polyclonal anti-Abl antibody K12. Immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to filters, and probed with either monoclonal anti-Abl antibody 8E9 (top) or anti-HA to detect Nck (bottom).Arrowhead indicates position of Myr 1+2 and Myr 1+2 PA. Upper band in the Nck blot is nonspecific.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because this result suggested that direct association of Nck SH3 domains with the Abl C terminus might not be required for activation, we considered other possible modes of interaction between Myr-1+2 and Abl. We noted that there is a potential type I SH3-binding site KRKPS(V/M)P located between SH3–1 and SH3–2 that is conserved in human, mouse, and Xenopus Nck.3 We reasoned that interaction between the Abl SH3 domain and this site could potentially relieve the inhibition of Abl and explain activation by the Nck constructs. To test this model we transfected 293T cells with a mutant Myr 1+2 in which one of the conserved prolines of the putative SH3-binding site was mutated to alanine (Myr 1+2 PA mutant). This mutation is expected to render this site unable to bind SH3 domains (48Mayer B.J. Eck M.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, the PA mutant activated both c-Abl and the AblΔPro mutant to a similar extent as WT Myr 1+2, and the PA mutation had no effect on coprecipitation of Abl and Myr-1+2 (Fig. 5). This demonstrates that the putative SH3-binding site in Nck is not required for activation. The results shown in Figs. 4 and 5 suggest that activation of c-Abl by Myr 1+2 cannot be explained simply by binding to the C terminus of c-Abl and relocalizing it to membranes. We confirmed this by constructing a myristoylated Crk SH3 domain. c-Abl binds the Crk SH3 domain with higher affinity than to the Nck SH3 domains (29Ren R. Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar)2; therefore a myristoylated Crk SH3 construct should activate c-Abl at least as well as the Nck Myr 1+2 construct if binding and relocalization were sufficient for activation. To the contrary, we found that although the Crk SH3 construct slightly activated c-Abl, the extent of activation was minimal when compared with Myr 1+2 or even to a myristoylated construct encoding the SH3–2 of Nck in the absence of SH3–1 (data not shown). Our results demonstrate that overexpression of Nck SH3 domains can potently activate the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abl kinase in transfected cells. The observation that Myr 1+2 could activate Abl was suggestive because this construct has the potential to relocalize Abl, and others have shown that a fraction of endogenous Abl translocates from the nucleus to focal adhesions upon integrin engagement, concomitant with its activation (24Lewis J.M. Baskaran R. Taagepera S. Schwartz M.A. Wang J.Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15174-15179Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 25Lewis J.M. Schwartz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14225-14230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To our surprise, however, we found that the major Nck SH3-binding sites in the Abl C terminus were not required for activation. Although we cannot rule out other cryptic SH3-binding sites in the C terminus that are able to partially compensate for the loss of the major Nck SH3-binding sites, the observation that the AblΔPro mutant (lacking the major SH3-binding sites) co-precipitated with Myr-1+2 much more poorly than WT Abl suggests this is not the case. We were also surprised to find that the unmyristoylated 1+2 construct (which is largely nuclear in localization 5J. M. Smith and B. J. Mayer, unpublished observation. ) could activate Abl, albeit at much higher levels of expression. This implies that increased membrane localization cannot explain activation of Abl by Nck, although membrane localization of the Nck SH3 domains clearly facilitates activation. One possibility that we considered was that the conserved potential SH3-binding site in Nck might engage the Abl SH3 domain and relieve inhibition, because activation of the Src family kinases has been observed using ligands that bind their SH3 domain (8Moarefi I. LeFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar,49Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, mutation of this putative SH3-binding site did not affect activation of Abl by Myr 1+2 (Fig. 4). Several possible mechanisms must be considered in trying to understand Nck-mediated activation of Abl. One intriguing possibility is that the action of Nck SH3 domains is indirect, the result of perturbation of signaling pathways that ultimately impinge on Abl activation. Little is known about specific stimuli that can activate c-Abl in vivo, and activation by Nck could provide important insights in this regard. Another possibility is that the Nck SH3 domains bind to and sequester an endogenous inhibitor of c-Abl that normally binds to the Abl SH3 domain (9Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Clark R. McCormick F. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5927-5931Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism would be more likely to explain the activation by large amounts of unmyristoylated 1+2; it is less likely to explain activation by Myr 1+2, given the small amounts of plasmid required for maximal activation. It is also possible that the Nck SH3 domains bind directly to the SH2-kinase domain linker of c-Abl, preventing inhibitory intramolecular interactions with the Abl SH3. If this were the case, then the much higher potency of the Myr 1+2 construct would imply that the membrane-associated pool of Abl is more susceptible to activation, or that membrane localization leads to higher local concentrations of Nck SH3 domains with respect to a pool of Abl that is also localized on the membrane. Because no single mechanism is entirely consistent with all of our experimental results, it must be kept in mind that multiple mechanisms could be involved. In this regard, our results using the C-terminally truncated Abl mutants SF and SG are quite informative (Fig. 3,A and C). The only difference between these two constructs is the presence or absence of the Abl SH3 domain, which is known to play a role in inhibiting kinase activity. The phosphotyrosine levels seen in the SG-Abl blot (Fig. 3 C) and the transforming activity of this mutant indicate that it is activated, and imply that SF-Abl could also be activated if the inhibitory effects of its intact SH3 domain were disrupted. The observation that SF-Abl is not activated by Myr 1+2 or 1+2 argues against any mechanism that only involves disruption of SH3-mediated repression. These results could be reconciled, however, if activation involves both a high local concentration of Nck SH3 domains with respect to Abl, plus a specific subcellular localization or protein interaction that is conferred by the C terminus. More specific Abl mutants will resolve the role of the C terminus in activation. Regardless of the specific mechanism(s), Nck-mediated activation provides an excellent experimental system to study the parameters governing Abl activity in vivo. It is robust and highly reproducible and allows analysis of mutants of both Abl and Nck. Further experiments will surely reveal the details of regulation and provide insights into methods for rationally modulating the activity of Abl in human disease."

We have recently investigated the role of the adaptor protein Shb in the early events of T cell signaling and observed that Shb associates with Grb2, linker for activation of T cells (LAT) and the TCR ζ-chain in Jurkat cells. We now report that Shb also associates with phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) in these cells. Overexpression of Src homology 2 domain defective Shb caused diminished phosphorylation of LAT and consequently the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases was decreased upon TCR stimulation. In addition, the Shb mutant also blocked phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and the increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ following TCR stimulation. Nuclear factor for activation of T cells is a major target for Ras and calcium signaling pathways in T cells following TCR stimulation, and the overexpression of the mutant Shb prevented TCR-dependent activation of the nuclear factor for activation of T cells. Consequently, endogenous interleukin-2 production was decreased under these conditions. The results indicate a role for Shb as a link between the TCR and downstream signaling events involving LAT and PLC-γ1 and resulting in the activation of transcription of the interleukin-2 gene.

The early events in T cell signaling involve the activation of several protein tyrosine kinases. After TCR ζ-chain phosphorylation (by the protein tyrosine kinases Lck or Fyn), a Syk family protein tyrosine kinase, ZAP70, binds the ζ chain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of the CD3 complex (1Weiss A.

Active ZAP70 is then responsible for phosphorylation and activation of many additional substrates: for example, phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1), p36/38 linker for activation of T cells (LAT) (2Zhang W.

Shb is an adaptor protein that contains a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain (12Welsh M. Mares J. Karlsson T. Lavergne C. Breant B. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 19-27PubMed Google Scholar) in its C terminus, proline-rich sequences in its N terminus, and a central phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain (13Welsh M. Songyang Z. Frantz J.D. Trub T. Reedquist K.A. Karlsson T. Miyazaki M. Cantley L.C. Band H. Shoelson S.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The proline-rich motifs in Shb have been found to interact with the SH3 domain of the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Src tyrosine kinase, and Eps8 (14Karlsson T. Songyang Z. Landgren E. Lavergne C. Di Fiore P.P. Anafi M. Pawson T. Cantley L.C. Claesson-Welsh L. Welsh M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1475-1483PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the SH2 domain of Shb associates with the PDGF β-receptor and the FGF receptor-1 (14Karlsson T. Songyang Z. Landgren E. Lavergne C. Di Fiore P.P. Anafi M. Pawson T. Cantley L.C. Claesson-Welsh L. Welsh M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1475-1483PubMed Google Scholar). In Jurkat T cells, Shb was found to interact with Grb2, p36/38, and the ζ-chain of the CD3 receptor (13Welsh M. Songyang Z. Frantz J.D. Trub T. Reedquist K.A. Karlsson T. Miyazaki M. Cantley L.C. Band H. Shoelson S.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The association between Shb and Grb2 is mediated by proline-rich/SH3 domain interactions, whereas p36/38 binds to the Shb PTB domain in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. Shb interacts with the CD3-associated ζ-chain via its SH2 domain. In this study we describe interactions between Shb and LAT and how a functional Shb SH2 domain is vital for phosphorylation of this Shb-LAT complex. In addition, we demonstrate that PLC-γ1 can interact with Shb and that a functional SH2 domain of Shb is important for PLC-γ1 activation and Ca2+ signaling. It is suggested that Shb plays a role in linking the TCR to cellular activation and IL-2 production in the immune response. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 and anti-Nck/PLC-γ1 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-CD3 antibodies were from Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA) and also kindly provided by Dr Hamid Band (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). R-PE-rat anti-human IL-2 antibodies were from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Antibodies recognizing tyrosine-phosphorylated MAP kinases were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The affinity purified Shb antiserum has been described elsewhere (15Karlsson T. Welsh M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 955-961PubMed Google Scholar). The LAT polyclonal antibody and Jurkat cells expressing wild-type and mutant (Y171F/Y191F) LAT have been described previously (2Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). PLC-γ1 polyclonal antibodies were a gift from Lars Rönnstrand (Ludvig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). Fetal clone II (FcII) serum was from Hyclone. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated antibodies (anti-mouse and anti-rabbit) and the ECL detection system were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein A/G-peroxidase was from Pierce. The Shb R522K plasmid was described previously (13Welsh M. Songyang Z. Frantz J.D. Trub T. Reedquist K.A. Karlsson T. Miyazaki M. Cantley L.C. Band H. Shoelson S.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, the arginine at position 522 (which is necessary for phosphotyrosine binding ability of the SH2 domain) was converted into a lysine by polymerase chain reaction-based in vitro mutagenesis, and the R522K Shb cDNA was subsequently inserted into the pcDNA1 expression vector. The Shb wild-type plasmid contains the Shb cDNA inserted in pcDNA 1. The NFAT-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (NFAT-CAT) plasmid was a kind gift from Drs Doreen Cantrell and Jane Babage (London, United Kingdom) and has been described previously (16Genot E. Cleverley S. Henning S. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17Williams D.H. Woodrow M. Cantrell D.A. Murray E.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FcII. Cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium lacking serum before stimulation with the CD3 antibody at 37 °C for 2 min. The cells were pelleted and lysed in either Triton lysis buffer (0.15 mNaCl, 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, 100 units/ml Trasylol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) or Brij lysis buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 0.025 m Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Brij 96, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 units/ml Trasylol, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation, and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with Shb, LAT, or PLC-γ1 antibodies. The immune complexes were pelleted with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose and subsequently washed three times with PBS, 1% Triton. The samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence or presence of β-mercaptoethanol (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and Western transfer onto Immobilon filter (Millipore) in 20% methanol, 190 mm glycine, 23 mm Tris, and 0.02% SDS. The blots were blocked in blocking solution (5% bovine serum albumin in PBS, 0.5% Tween (4G-10 only), or 5% milk in PBS, 0.1% Tween (all other antibodies) and incubated with primary antibodies as indicated. Immunoreactivity was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. Jurkat T cells (2 × 106) were washed twice in PBS and transfected by electroporation (390 V, 960 microfarads in a 1-cm cuvette) with 30 μg of Shb R522K cDNA in expression vector pcDNAI and 3 μg of pSV2-neo plasmids. Stable transfectants were selected for geneticin resistance with 1 mg/ml G418. Transient transfections were performed by electroporation as for the stable transfectants above. In a set of experiments 40 μg of NFAT-CAT plasmid was cotransfected with 40 μg of R522K Shb plasmid or 40 μg of empty pcDNAI plasmid. Alternatively, 40 μg of the NFAT-CAT plasmid was transfected into the Jurkat R522K-2, -3, and -neo clones. In both sets of experiments, the cells were cultured for 2 days and then stimulated, in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% serum, for 16 h with CD3 antibody + TPA (50 nm) or with TPA (50 nm) alone or left unstimulated. Cells were then analyzed for CAT activity as described below. Transient transfections for measurements of intracellular IL-2 levels were performed in a similar manner. 4 × 106 Jurkat cells were transfected either with 60 μg of R522K Shb plasmid or 60 μg of empty pcDNA1 plasmid. The cells were cultured for 2 days and then stimulated, in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% serum and 2 μm monensin, for 6 h with CD3 antibody (9 μg/ml) + TPA (50 nm) or with TPA (50 nm) + ionomycin (0.5 μg/ml) or left untreated. The cells were then treated as described below. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation and cell extracts were assayed for CAT activity as described (19Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized according to the protocol “Immunofluorescent staining of intracellular cytokines for flow cytometric analysis” from Pharmingen. The cells were then stained with an R-PE-rat anti-human IL-2 antibody for 30 min in the dark, washed, and subsequently analyzed for fluorescence by flow cytometry on a FACS Calibur cell sorter from Becton Dickinson. Batches of 2.5 × 106 Jurkat-neo or Jurkat-R522K-2 cells were suspended in 5 ml of medium containing 125 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 3 mm glucose, and 25 mm HEPES, with the pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. After addition of 5 μm fura-2 acetoxymethylester the cells were allowed to accumulate fura-2 during 40 min at 37 °C. After loading, the cells were spun down and washed with identical medium lacking the indicator. After suspension in 1 ml of medium, the cells were transferred to a 1-cm quartz cuvette placed in the thermostatically controlled (37 °C) cuvette holder of a time-sharing multichannel spectrophotofluorometer (20Chance B. Legallais V. Sorge J. Graham N. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 66: 498-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic Ca2+concentration was measured as described previously (21Gylfe E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5044-5048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), compensating for leakage of the Ca2+ indicator fura-2 from the cells during the experiments but without initial compensation for extracellular indicator. Addition of anti-CD3 was made by injecting 10 μl of a 100-fold concentrated solution. We previously failed to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of Shb in response to TCR activation in Jurkat cells (13Welsh M. Songyang Z. Frantz J.D. Trub T. Reedquist K.A. Karlsson T. Miyazaki M. Cantley L.C. Band H. Shoelson S.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is conceivable, however, that tyrosine-phosphorylated Shb isoforms were concealed in those experiments by IgG background reactivity. We have subsequently observed tyrosine phosphorylation of Shb in response to FGF (22Claesson-Welsh L. Welsh M. Ito N. Anand-Apte B. Soker S. Zetter B. O'Reilly M. Folkman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5579-5583Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and NGF (23Karlsson T. Kullander K. Welsh M. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 757-766PubMed Google Scholar) and thus decided to re-evaluate the possibility of TCR-dependent phosphorylation of Shb. Cell extracts from CD3-stimulated and unstimulated Jurkat cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the Shb antibody, under native conditions or after boiling for 2 min in the presence of 1% SDS. Electrophoresis was performed under nonreducing conditions to minimize the IgG background. Western blot analysis using a phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig.1) revealed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p55 Shb upon TCR stimulation in Jurkat-neo cells, observed with equal intensity both when immunoprecipitating native cell extracts and also after boiling the cell extracts in the presence of SDS. The latter procedure decreases the association of proteins to Shb, thus distinguishing between the presence of Shb-associated proteins and Shb itself in the immunoprecipitates. Absence of an effect by boiling in SDS indicates that the 55-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated product is indeed Shb. We thus conclude that Shb becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation. To identify the p36/38 phosphotyrosine protein previously shown to associate with Shb (13Welsh M. Songyang Z. Frantz J.D. Trub T. Reedquist K.A. Karlsson T. Miyazaki M. Cantley L.C. Band H. Shoelson S.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as the recently cloned linker protein LAT (2Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), we have utilized a double immunoprecipitation technique because IgG background reactivity excluded direct demonstration of Shb in α-LAT immunoprecipitates andvice versa. Jurkat cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with the α-Shb antibody, and aliquots of the immunoprecipitated proteins, after dissociation with SDS, were then subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with an antibody against LAT or normal rabbit serum. The immunoprecipitates were then blotted for phosphotyrosine using the monoclonal 4G10 antibody to reduce IgG background. Fig.2, A and B,demonstrates a band corresponding to p36/38 LAT only in the α-Shb immunoprecipitated, CD3-stimulated lanes. In the aliquots subjected to a second immunoprecipitation after SDS-dissociation, the identical band was detected at a similar intensity only when using the α-LAT antibody, indicating complete immunoprecipitation of the Shb-immunoprecipitated p36/38 LAT phosphotyrosine band using the α-LAT antibody. This identifies the 36/38-kDa protein found to associate with Shb as the linker protein LAT. To characterize the interaction between Shb and LAT, peptide displacement experiments were performed, in which the binding of LAT to immobilized Shb PTB domain fusion protein (gstp55ShbΔsh2) was determined. Three peptides encompassing possible tyrosine phosphorylation sites of LAT (Tyr-45, pLAT-1; Tyr-127, pLAT-2; and Tyr-171, pLAT-3) with Asp in position 2 or 3 upstream of the tyrosine (thus conforming with the Shb PTB domain consensus binding sequence) were synthesized and used for experimentation. In Fig. 2 C,inhibition of LAT binding to the Shb PTB domain was noted with all three peptides. The pLAT-1 peptide produced a 45% inhibition of binding at 0.2 mm, whereas the other two peptides achieved an inhibition of more than 90% at this concentration. LAT binding to the Shb PTB domain was also completely blocked by free phosphotyrosine. When the corresponding experiment was performed adding the peptides at a final concentration of 50 μm, the pLAT-1 peptide did not inhibit the binding of LAT to the Shb PTB domain fusion protein, whereas the inhibition of association in the presence of the pLAT-2 and pLAT-3 peptides was 60 and 86%, respectively. The data thus raise the possibility of multiple binding sites for the Shb PTB domain on tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT including tyrosines 127 and 171. To further assess the role of the Shb SH2 domain for TCR signaling, Jurkat cells were transfected with a cDNA construct containing an R522K mutation in the SH2 domain of Shb as described previously (13Welsh M. Songyang Z. Frantz J.D. Trub T. Reedquist K.A. Karlsson T. Miyazaki M. Cantley L.C. Band H. Shoelson S.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Subsequent clonal selection for neomycin resistance yielded 60 clones, several of which showed overexpression of R522K Shb. Nine clones overexpressing R522K Shb were initially assessed for tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in response to CD3 stimulation, and seven of these exhibited a distinctly decreased response compared with the control Jurkat cells (results not shown). Two of these clones showing an altered response to CD3 stimulation were named Jurkat R522K-2 and R522K-3 and investigated further in the present study. We have previously described the properties of one clone overexpressing an R522K Shb called Jurkat R522K-1 (13Welsh M. Songyang Z. Frantz J.D. Trub T. Reedquist K.A. Karlsson T. Miyazaki M. Cantley L.C. Band H. Shoelson S.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the effect of the R522K mutation in the Shb SH2 domain on the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in whole cell lysates after stimulation with anti-CD3 antibodies in the two clones, as determined by Western blot analysis using the phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. The Jurkat R522K-2 and -3 cells show weaker tyrosine phosphorylation in response to TCR stimulation by CD3 cross-linking compared with the neomycin resistant control cells of proteins migrating as 160, 70, and 66 kDa and p36/38 LAT. Especially the Jurkat R522K-2 clone displays very poor phosphorylation in response to TCR stimulation, and these cells exhibited a higher degree of R522K Shb expression than the R522K-3 cells (Fig. 3) and the R522K-1 cells (13Welsh M. Songyang Z. Frantz J.D. Trub T. Reedquist K.A. Karlsson T. Miyazaki M. Cantley L.C. Band H. Shoelson S.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These results are in fair agreement with the previously observed response to expression of R522K Shb in the Jurkat R522K-1 cells (13Welsh M. Songyang Z. Frantz J.D. Trub T. Reedquist K.A. Karlsson T. Miyazaki M. Cantley L.C. Band H. Shoelson S.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To further investigate the effects of the Shb R522K mutation on the tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT, anti-CD3-stimulated Jurkat-neo or Jurkat R522K-2 cells were lysed, and proteins were immunoprecipitated with α-LAT antibodies. The blot was subsequently probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and anti-LAT antibodies (Fig.4). The data demonstrate that even though the levels of LAT are similar in all lanes, the phosphorylation of LAT in response to CD3 stimulation is abolished in the cells expressing the Shb mutant with a defective SH2 domain. These results suggest that Shb with a functional SH2 domain is of significance for linking LAT to tyrosine kinases in the T cell and for the subsequent phosphorylation of LAT upon TCR stimulation. Association between Shb and LAT might therefore be an important early event in the signaling cascade following TCR engagement in T cells. To determine the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT associated with wild-type and mutant Shb, we performed SDS-boil immunoprecipitation experiments on CD3-stimulated/unstimulated Jurkat-neo cells and Jurkat R522K-2 cells, as described previously (Fig. 1). Western blot analyses of these α-Shb immunoprecipitates revealed in the Shb SH2-defective clone, Jurkat R522K-2, no increased phosphorylation of either Shb or LAT after TCR stimulation. In the normal Jurkat-neo clone we saw a marked increase in the phosphorylation of LAT after TCR stimulation, and tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT present in these immunoprecipitates was largely dissociated by SDS treatment, indicating that it is in association with Shb. Conversely, Jurkat cells overexpressing a mutant LAT (Y171F/Y191F) (2Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), with two tyrosines mutated to phenylalanine, displayed reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of both p55 and p66 Shb in response to TCR stimulation despite the presence of similar amounts of Shb in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5 A). Because the transfected wild-type and mutant LAT were tagged with a Myc epitope, the amounts of LAT in the corresponding Shb immunoprecipitates were determined by blotting for Myc (Fig. 5 A). Similar amounts of epitope-tagged LAT were present in the immunoprecipitates from both the wild-type and mutant LAT clones, regardless of whether the cells were CD3-stimulated or not. In the cell lysates, the phosphorylation of LAT in absolute and relative amounts was reduced in response to CD3 stimulation in the cells expressing the mutant LAT to a degree similar as that observed in the Shb immunoprecipitates (Fig.5 B). It seems that the association between LAT and Shb is crucial for the phosphorylation of both Shb and LAT in response to TCR stimulation. We therefore suggest that the association between Shb and LAT creates a signaling complex that might also involve other adaptor proteins in the T cell signaling pathway. To assess the effects of the R522K mutation in the Shb SH2 domain on the activation of MAP kinases extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase-1 and -2 upon TCR stimulation, blots from cell extracts of CD3-stimulated and unstimulated Jurkat R522K-2, Jurkat R522K-3, and Jurkat-neo cells were probed with an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated MAPK (Fig. 3). The degree of phosphorylation upon stimulation equals the degree of activation. Total MAPK is also shown as a control of equal loading. Jurkat R522K-2 and -3 cells displayed a decreased phosphorylation of both extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase-1 and -2 MAP kinases (p42 and p44) after CD3 stimulation compared with the Jurkat-neo cells. It is thus concluded that the altered pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation in cells with a defective Shb SH2 domain diminishes the activation of the MAP kinases in Jurkat T cells. Because PLC-γ1 is an important component of TCR-mediated signaling, and because PLC-γ1 is known to be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in TCR-activated cells, we decided to investigate the potential interactions between Shb and PLC-γ1. PLC-γ1 was present in α-Shb immunoprecipitates, but not after immunoprecipitation with preimmune serum as assessed by Western blot analysis using an antibody reactive with PLC-γ1 regardless of whether the cells were CD3-stimulated or not (Fig.6 A). To see whether the phosphorylation and activation of PLC-γ1 is negatively affected by a defective Shb SH2 domain, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using a PLC-γ1 antiserum on the Jurkat R522K-2 and Jurkat-neo cells followed by Western blot analysis for phosphotyrosine. As displayed in Fig. 6 B, the mutant clone R522K-2 displays a significantly decreased level of PLC-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation compared with the neo control cells. To address the significance of the R522K mutation for the association between Shb and PLC-γ1, the presence of PLC-γ1 in the anti-Shb immunoprecipitates of Jurkat-neo and Jurkat-R522K-2 cells was determined (Fig. 6 C). As noted, the presence of PLC-γ1 was similar in all immunoprecipitates, regardless of CD3 stimulation or whether these were from control or Shb-mutant cells. Similarly, the binding of PLC-γ1 to immobilized p55 Shb R522K fusion protein was equal regardless of the presence of 20 mm phosphotyrosine during the binding reaction or whether the cells had been CD3-stimulated or not (Fig. 6 D). Thus, the association between Shb and PLC-γ1 appears not to require a functional Shb SH2 domain, is phosphotyrosine-independent, and does not require CD3 stimulation. One possible mode of interaction is that between proline-rich sequence of Shb and the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1. A functional Shb SH2 domain is nevertheless required for efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1. It is known that PLC-γ1 regulates the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol phosphate and thereby generates inositol 1,4,5-tris-phosphate and diacylglycerol, of which the former increases cytoplasmic calcium levels. Therefore Jurkat R522K-2 and Jurkat-neo cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 antibodies, whereas intracellular Ca2+ was measured using a time-sharing dual wavelength fluorometric approach (Fig.7). After a delay of about 30 s, anti-CD3 induced a pronounced [Ca2+]i response in Jurkat-neo but not in Jurkat R522K-2 cells. These results indicate that the interactions between PLC-γ1 and the TCR involve Shb and are essential for the increase in intracellular Ca2+. The IL-2 promoter contains several regulatory elements that can bind different transcription factors, such as NFAT, Oct, AP-1, and NF-κB. To investigate the importance of the Shb SH2 domain for T cell receptor signaling downstream of MAP kinases and PLC-γ1, the effects on transcription from the IL-2 regulatory NFAT binding element after TCR stimulation were studied. For this we have used a reporter gene construct composed of a triplet of the NFAT binding site from the IL-2 promoter region coupled to a CAT reporter, because this regulatory element is particularly important for T cell receptor signaling (17Williams D.H. Woodrow M. Cantrell D.A. Murray E.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with vector alone (pcDNA1) or mutant R522K Shb inserted into this vector, together with the NFAT-CAT construct. All values were normalized relative TPA + CD3-stimulated cells transfected with pcDNA1 only after subtraction of the corresponding values of nonstimulated cells. Fig. 8 Ademonstrates that the cells expressing a mutation in the SH2 domain of Shb display no activation of this element upon TCR stimulation, whereas in the control cells, a 3-fold increase in the NFAT-mediated transcription can be seen after TCR stimulation compared with TPA treatment alone. CD3 stimulation without concomitant TPA treatment resulted in a weak stimulation of NFAT activity (results not shown). When the Jurkat-neo, Jurkat R522K-2 and -3 clones were analyzed for NFAT activation in a manner similar to that described above, it was observed that both Jurkat R522K-2 and -3 cells display a poor NFAT-mediated induction of transcription in response to CD3 cross-linking compared with the Jurkat-neo cells (Fig. 8 B). The NFAT activity in these experiments was normalized in a different manner than in Fig. 8 A, because the different clones displayed a large variation in their transfection efficiency, thus requiring an intraclonal normalization procedure. We have also looked at the endogenous IL-2 levels in Jurkat cells transiently transfected with vector, wild-type Shb, or mutant R522K Shb, using a phycoerytrin-conjugated IL-2 antibody and FACS analysis. The cells were stimulated for 6 h with CD3+TPA or with TPA + ionomycin or left unstimulated. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized together with PE-αIL-2 antibody, and analyzed by FACS. We observed a 4-fold increase in IL-2 expression in the vector and wild-type Shb-transfected cells after stimulation with CD3 and TPA, whereas there was no increase in IL-2 production in the R522K Shb transfected cells after CD3+TPA stimulation (Fig. 8 C). To assess the maximal IL-2 response, we stimulated cells with ionomycin+TPA, which produced a 18–24-fold increase of the IL-2 contents in the R522K Shb, wild-type Shb, and control transfected cells (Fig. 8 C). The results in Fig. 8 indicate that the adaptor protein Shb plays an important role in the signaling cascade that leads to activation of transcription via the NFAT element of the IL-2 gene following TCR stimulation. We have previously established a role for Shb in TCR signaling by describing SH2 domain-dependent binding of Shb to the TCR ζ-chain, PTB domain-dependent association of Shb to p36/38 LAT, and proline-rich/SH3 domain interactions with Grb2 (13Welsh M. Songyang Z. Frantz J.D. Trub T. Reedquist K.A. Karlsson T. Miyazaki M. Cantley L.C. Band H. Shoelson S.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,14Karlsson T. Songyang Z. Landgren E. Lavergne C. Di Fiore P.P. Anafi M. Pawson T. Cantley L.C. Claesson-Welsh L. Welsh M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1475-1483PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we describe Shb signaling, through MAPK and Ca2+, eventually causing activation of the NFAT element in the IL-2 gene promoter. To elucidate the importance of the previously observed interaction between the Shb SH2 domain and the ζ-chain of the TCR (13Welsh M. Songyang Z. Frantz J.D. Trub T. Reedquist K.A. Karlsson T. Miyazaki M. Cantley L.C. Band H. Shoelson S.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) we have introduced a point mutation in the SH2 domain of Shb and expressed this mutant. As a consequence, a number of signaling molecules are not phosphorylated in response to TCR engagement in cells expressing the Shb without a functional SH2 domain. The results indicate that Shb and p36/38 LAT form a complex that is of importance for the phosphorylation of both Shb and LAT upon TCR engagement and further signaling via both the Ras and Ca2+ pathways. p36/38 LAT is a membrane-associated protein that has been shown to bind Grb2, Sos (possibly via Grb2), PLC-γ1, and the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (2Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 24Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). It is also one of the most prominently tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins detected following TCR engagement (25June C.H. Fletcher M.C. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. Siegel J.N. Phillips A.F. Samelson L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7722-7726Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). It was previously thought that this p36/38 protein might be responsible for linking PLC-γ1 and the Grb2-Sos complex to the TCR. However, cloning of the p36/38 linker revealed a protein with several tyrosine phosphorylation sites but no SH2 or other binding domains. We currently propose that Shb might be an adaptor participating in linking p36/38 LAT with the TCR ζ-chain via the SH2 and PTB domains of Shb. The Shb-LAT complex after TCR stimulation appears capable of serving as a substrate for protein tyrosine kinases, such as ZAP70, that previously has been shown to phosphorylate LAT (2Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). The kinase can then mediate the phosphorylation of the Shb-LAT complex, and other signaling proteins associated with it, such as PLC-γ1. Our results do not exclude the involvement of other pathways of significance for interactions between LAT and ZAP70 or the TCR ζ-chain resulting in phosphorylation of LAT. The Jurkat R522K-3 clone exhibiting moderately elevated contents of R522K Shb demonstrated diminished but detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT in response to TCR activation. Such a finding raises the possibility of other, Shb-independent mechanisms for targeting LAT to appropriate sites adjacent to the TCR. Besides the lipophilic properties of LAT itself, the involvement of the 3BP2 adaptor molecule could be of relevance in this context (26Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Hernandez J. Rottapel R. Altman A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The phosphotyrosine-dependent association between Shb and LAT observed previously (13Welsh M. Songyang Z. Frantz J.D. Trub T. Reedquist K.A. Karlsson T. Miyazaki M. Cantley L.C. Band H. Shoelson S.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and in the present study and the peptide displacement data demonstrated in the present study using the pLAT-1, -2, and -3 peptides suggest that Shb associates with one or several of the many potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites present in LAT (2Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Although the Tyr-171 peptide efficiently inhibited the binding of LAT to the Shb PTB domain, this position cannot alone mediate this interaction, because binding of LAT to Shb was detected in the cells expressing the Y171F/Y191F mutant, albeit at a reduced level, suggesting a modest decrease of LAT-Shb association with this mutant. Another potential site of interaction between these two molecules is tyrosine 127. Association between Shb and LAT was noted in nonstimulated cells, suggesting that basal phosphorylation of LAT without CD3 stimulation is sufficient for at least partial Shb association. The data show that Shb and PLC-γ1 associate in T cells and that this interaction is independent of TCR stimulation. A possible mode of interaction is that between the proline-rich sequences in the N terminus of Shb and the SH3 domain of PLC-γ1. However, expression of a mutant LAT also diminishes its association with PLC-γ1 (2Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), implying a functional relationship between those two molecules as well. In order to reconcile these observations, we propose a model in which a trimeric complex between Shb, LAT, and PLC-γ1 exists. One potential mechanism for targeting such a complex to the TCR ζ-chain is via the SH2 domain of Shb, and thus the complex will be brought in contact with TCR-associated tyrosine kinases that activate PLC-γ1 by phosphorylation. Active PLC-γ1 is known to regulate intracellular Ca2+ through inositol phospholipids, and as anticipated, the Jurkat R522K-2 cells are unable to increase the Ca2+concentration in response to TCR activation. Shb has previously been shown to associate with Grb2 (13Welsh M. Songyang Z. Frantz J.D. Trub T. Reedquist K.A. Karlsson T. Miyazaki M. Cantley L.C. Band H. Shoelson S.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and because Grb2 efficiently binds via its SH2 domain tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT, it is conceivable that a trimeric protein complex also exists between Shb, LAT, and Grb2. Again, this complex may at least partly be targeted to the TCR ζ-chain by the Shb SH2 domain. Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras, also associates with Grb2 and LAT (2Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), thus connecting signaling through Shb with the Ras/MAPK pathway. This is further supported by the significantly decreased degree of MAP kinase activation in response to TCR stimulation in the Jurkat R522K mutant clones. It is known that the Ras/MAPK-pathway and the Ca2+ pathway cooperate in T cells to activate the IL-2 promoter through the transcription factors NFAT and AP-1. The Ras/MAPK pathway can activate AP-1 and also synergize with the calcium pathway to activate the T cell-specific transcription factor NFAT. NFAT proteins translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus in TCR-activated cells and can combine with AP-1 to form a transcription factor complex (27Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) and initiate IL-2 gene transcription. There have been reports on a number of signaling proteins affecting NFAT activation: for example, p36/38 LAT (2Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), p21 Ras (28Woodrow M. Clipstone N.A. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1517-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), Vav, and SLP-76 (3Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Shb has been shown to play a role in both the Ras/MAPK pathway and the calcium signaling pathway, and it was not surprising that TCR-mediated activation of NFAT is also abolished in Jurkat cells expressing an R522K mutation in the Shb SH2 domain. Both stable and transient transfectants failed to activate NFAT in response to TCR engagement. The results presented in this study provide evidence that Shb is an adaptor protein involved early in T cell receptor signaling pathways through its interactions with the T cell receptor ζ-chain, LAT, Grb2, and PLC-γ1. Other proteins of importance for T cell signaling are SLP-76, Vav, Cbl, and CrkL (3Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 29Peterson E.J. Clements J.L. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). At present, possible interactions between these proteins and Shb have not been elucidated. The participation of Shb in other signaling pathways than MAP kinases and Ca2+ in Jurkat cells are potentially of great interest and will be addressed in future studies.

Therefore, we examined whether cAMP-dependent kinase mediates phosphorylation of the thromboxane A2 receptor-G-protein complex. It was found that cAMP induces protein kinase A-dependent [γ-32P]ATP labeling of solubilized membrane proteins in the region of Gα subunits, i.e. 38–45 kDa. Moreover, ligand affinity chromatography purification of thromboxane A2 receptor-G-protein complexes from these membranes revealed that 38–45-kDa phosphoproteins co-purify with thromboxane A2 receptors. Immunoprecipitation of the affinity column eluate with a Gα13 antibody demonstrated that 8-Br-cAMP increased phosphorylation of thromboxane A2receptor-associated Gα13 by 87 ± 27%. In separate experiments, immunopurification of Gα13 on microtiter wells coated with a different Gα13 antibody revealed that 8-Br-cAMP increased Gα13 phosphorylation by 53 ± 19%. Finally, treatment of 32P-labeled whole platelets with prostacyclin resulted in a 90 ± 14% increase in phosphorylated Gα13 that was abolished by pretreatment with the adenylate cyclase inhibitor MDL-12.

On this basis, investigators have sought to understand better TXA2-induced signal transduction processes in an attempt to develop new therapeutic strategies for managing TXA2 receptor-mediated thrombotic events. However, despite these efforts, significant gaps remain in our understanding of signal transduction, and modulation of signal transduction, through this pathway. At present, it is known that at least one pool of platelet TXA2 receptors is coupled to phospholipase C through the pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein Gαq (8Brace L.D. Venton D.L. Le Breton G.C.

Thus, TXA2 receptor activation of phospholipase C leads to inositol triphosphate/diacylglycerol generation and a subsequent mobilization of intraplatelet calcium (8Brace L.D. Venton D.L.

Thus, it is well known that platelet activity is inhibited by elevated cAMP levels, and it is generally accepted that this inhibitory effect is mediated by protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of different protein substrates. For example, cAMP-induced phosphorylation of certain downstream signaling components such as myosin light chain kinase and thrombolamban causes inhibition of contractile processes and calcium-dependent processes, respectively (30Hathaway D.R. Eaton C.R. Adelstein R.S. Nature. 1981; 291: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31Feinstein M.B. Egan J.J. Opas E.E. J. Biol.

Furthermore, separate studies have established a direct relationship between platelet cAMP levels and the ability of TXA2receptors to mobilize intraplatelet calcium (34Owen N.E. Le Breton G.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 241: H613-H619PubMed Google Scholar). This latter phenomenon, in turn, raises the possibility that the TXA2signaling components themselves may serve as potential PKA substrates. In this connection, it is known that phosphorylation of receptors by second messenger kinases can modulate their function (35Nambi P. Peters J.R. Sibley D.R. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2165-2171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 37Bohm S.K. Grady E.F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). This phenomenon has been well studied in the β-adrenergic receptor system, in which PKA-induced receptor phosphorylation has been linked to heterologous receptor desensitization (39Perkins J.P. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1983; 18: 85-107Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 40Sibley D.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the physiological consequence of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of TXA2 receptors is unclear. Thus, even though it was found that TXA2 receptor protein can be phosphorylated by PKA in receptor expression systems, the authors of this study (27Habib A. Vezza R. Creminon C. Maclouf J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) concluded that PKA had no functional significance in mediating agonist-induced TXA2 receptor desensitization. In contrast to cAMP, however, other investigators (29Wang G.-R. Zhu Y. Halushka P.V. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4888-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) have recently reported that cGMP-dependent phosphorylation of TXA2receptors by protein kinase G (PKG) inhibits agonist-induced GTPase activity in platelet membranes. This finding may in part explain the inhibitory effects of cGMP on platelet function. Finally, phosphorylation of G-proteins has also been shown to constitute a mechanism for signal modulation through seven transmembrane receptors. For example, protein kinase C (PKC) has been shown to induce phosphorylation of at least three Gα subunits,i.e. Gαi, Gαz, and Gα12 (41Carlson K.E. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

Thus, whereas Offermanns et al. (47Offermanns S. Hu Y.-H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26044-26048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) found that Gα13 can be phosphorylated by PKC in platelets as well as in a reconstituted system, Kozasa and Gilman (46Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12562-12567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) reported that the purified Gα13 subunit was not a PKC substrate. In contrast to PKC, there have been fewer reports of G-protein phosphorylation induced by cyclic nucleotides. In this regard, PKA- and PKG-mediated phosphorylation of Gα subunits has only been described to occur in limited cell types and has not yet been demonstrated to occur in platelets (43Lounsbury K.M.

In summary, various mechanisms have been proposed for cyclic nucleotide-induced modulation of signaling either at the TXA2 receptor level itself or at more distant effector sites. In order to provide additional information concerning this potentially important regulatory process, the present study investigated the ability of cAMP to induce phosphorylation of TXA2 receptor-associated G-proteins. Since other investigators (43Lounsbury K.M. Schlegel B. Poncz M. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3494-3498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that platelet Gαq is not a PKA substrate, we examined the ability of PKA to phosphorylate TXA2 receptor-coupled Gα13. In these studies, it was found in both platelet membranes and intact platelets that cAMP stimulates phosphorylation of Gα13. These results provide the first evidence for PKA-mediated phosphorylation of an endogenous G-protein α subunit in human platelets and identify one such α subunit as being TXA2 receptor-associated Gα13. This ability of cAMP to cause Gα13phosphorylation may, in part, explain our separate finding that TXA2-mediated signal transduction is preferentially sensitive to inhibition by prostacyclin (PGI2).

The resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in buffer A to yield a final protein concentration of 2–4 mg/ml. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (53Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar), and the gels were silver-stained as described by Morrissey (54Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar), dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Silver-stained gels and autoradiographic films were analyzed by using a Protein Databases, Inc. densitometer (Huntington Station, NY). Solubilized platelet membranes were phosphorylated (2–4 mg of protein) in a reaction mixture containing 1 μm cAMP, 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP or vehicle (deionized water), 100–150 μm [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol), 60 μm CaCl2, and incubation buffer (45 mm histidine HCl, 50 mmKH2PO4, 20 mm NaF, 120 mm KCl, pH 7.4) in a total volume of 1600–2300 μl. In some experiments, NaF was 40 mm, and 2 mmsodium orthovanadate was added as an additional phosphatase inhibitor. In other experiments, the specific PKA inhibitor, IP20(55Cheng H.-C. Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Smith A.J. Misconi L. Van Patten S.M. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 989-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was added (3.6 μm). The reaction mixture was allowed to incubate for 30 min at 25 °C, after which time the phosphorylated proteins were either added to Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8) and resolved by SDS-PAGE, purified by ligand affinity chromatography as described under “Ligand Affinity Purification of TXA2Receptor-G-Protein Complexes,” or added to G-13 antibody-coated microtiter plates as described under “Immunological Techniques.” In separate experiments, platelet membranes (1–2 mg of protein) were phosphorylated in a reaction mixture containing 1 μmcAMP, 86 μm [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol), 1 mm EGTA, and incubation buffer in a volume of 2.25 ml. Following incubation for 30 min at 25 °C, the membranes were centrifuged for 15 min at 100,0 × g. The pellet was washed twice with buffer A and was solubilized in 2 ml of buffer B (10 mm CHAPS, 50 mm Tris, 5 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4) that was supplemented with 20 mmNaF. The solubilized membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was subjected to ligand affinity chromatography in order to purify the TXA2receptor-G-protein complex, as described below. Platelet TXA2receptor-G-protein complexes were purified as described previously (52Kim S. Lim C.T. Lam C.-T. Hall S.E. Komiotis D. Venton D.L. Le Breton G.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphorylated, solubilized platelet membranes were supplemented with 500 mm KCl, 0.5 mg/ml asolectin, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm CHAPS and were incubated overnight with the ligand affinity column matrix, which utilizes the TXA2 receptor antagonist SQ31,491 coupled to Affi-Gel 102. Unbound proteins were washed away with buffer D (20 mm Tris base, 10 mm CHAPS, 20% glycerol, 500 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mg/ml asolectin, pH 7.4) that was supplemented with 20 mm NaF and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate. The TXA2receptor-G-protein complexes were eluted from the column using the TXA2 antagonist 50 mm BM13.177 in buffer D at a flow rate of 1 ml/8 min. The first 1-ml elution fraction was collected, and the column was clamped for 30 min. Subsequently, two 1-ml elution fractions were collected, and the fractions were pooled, concentrated, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. To determine whether the same amount of receptor was eluted from each column, the pooled elution fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gels were silver-stained. Densitometric analysis of the stained receptor bands verified that the same amount of receptor protein was eluted in each set of experiments. In separate experiments, the pooled elution fraction was used for immunoprecipitation studies using the Gα13-N IgG as described under “Immunological Techniques.” Human platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared from acid/citrate/dextrose anticoagulated blood as described (34Owen N.E. Le Breton G.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 241: H613-H619PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were then32P-labeled by a modification of the method of Carlsonet al. (41Carlson K.E. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13298-13305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PRP was incubated with 3 mm aspirin for 45 min at room temperature to inhibit cyclooxygenase. Platelets were collected from PRP by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min and were washed once in a solution of modified Tyrode's buffer (20 mm HEPES, 138 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm glucose, 5 mm EDTA, 0.35% bovine serum albumin, 60 μg/ml apyrase) to which 50 units/ml heparin was added. Platelets were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer (without heparin) to a concentration of 2 × 109 cells/ml, and were incubated with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]H3PO4 (9000 Ci/mmol) for 60 min at room temperature. Following incubation with 3.3 mmNaH3PO4 for 15 min, portions of the platelet suspension (e.g. 2 × 109 cells) were incubated with 500 μm MDL-12 or vehicle (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 15 min and were subsequently incubated with 1 mm IBMX and 1 μm PGI2 or vehicle (ethanol and 0.05m Tris buffer, pH 9, respectively) for 5 min. Samples were immediately cooled in an ice slurry, and the platelets were pelleted by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 3 min and were washed twice in ice-cold buffer A that was supplemented with 2 μm okadaic acid. Platelets were solubilized in buffer B containing 2 μm okadaic acid and were sonicated (30-s bursts with 15-s rests) for 4 min and homogenized (10 strokes with a Teflon homogenizer). The solubilized mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the sonication and centrifugation steps were repeated. The solubilized proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described below. Precipitated32P counts were normalized for the amount of immunoprecipitated Gα13 by immunoblotting the precipitated protein fraction with the Gα13-N antibody and analyzing the labeled protein by densitometry. For immunoprecipitation experiments, 1 ml of the pooled ligand affinity column eluate was incubated with 75 μl of either Gα13-N IgG (200 μg/ml) or preimmune IgG (200 μg/ml) and was mixed overnight at 4 °C. Protein-A Sepharose beads were then added (55 μl of a 10% (w/v) suspension). After mixing overnight at 4 °C, the beads were isolated by centrifugation and were washed three times with 400 μl of buffer containing 10 mm CHAPS in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The final pellet was boiled for 5 min in the presence of Laemmli sample buffer (which was devoid of bromphenol blue) plus buffer B, and the mixture was centrifuged to pellet the beads. The resulting supernatant (60 μl) was added to scintillation mixture, and the32P-labeled proteins were quantified using a liquid scintillation spectrometer (Beckman LS 6800). Specific phosphorylation was calculated as the difference between counts obtained with Gα13-N IgG and preimmune IgG. For the whole cell experiments, Gα13 was precipitated using 150 μl of Gα13-N IgG and 55 μl of the protein A-Sepharose bead suspension. For immunoaffinity purification of Gα13 on microtiter plates, Immulon 2 microtiter wells were coated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of G-13 IgG (100 μg/ml) or preimmune IgG (100 μg/ml). The wells were then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 25 °C and were washed once with 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Solubilized platelet membranes that were phosphorylated in the presence or absence of 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP (50 μl), as described previously, were incubated on the antibody-coated microtiter wells overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed three times with 300 μl of buffer B, and the labeled protein was eluted from the wells using 50 μl of tissue solubilizer. The eluted, 32P-labeled proteins were added to scintillation mixture and were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Specific phosphorylation was calculated as the difference between counts obtained with G-13 IgG and preimmune IgG. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically from SDS gels onto nitrocellulose membranes according to the method of Towbin et al. (56Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44918) Google Scholar), and membranes were blocked with 3% gelatin in Tris-buffered saline. The membranes were incubated overnight at room temperature with the indicated dilution of Gα13-N IgG or preimmune IgG. Membranes were then washed with 0.1% Tween in Tris-buffered saline and were treated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) as the secondary antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled avidin and were detected using 4-chloro-1-naphthol as the substrate (0.5 mg/ml). Blood was drawn into acid/citrate/dextrose anticoagulant, and PRP was prepared as described above. Platelets were treated for 1 min with indomethacin (10 μm) in order to prevent endogenous TXA2production. Aggregation was stimulated with either U46619, ADP, TRAP, or A23187 at a concentration that yielded approximately 85% of the maximal aggregation response (sub-maximal dose), and the aggregation response was measured by the turbidimetric method (57Born G.V.R.

Here, we report that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 induced by either okadaic acid (OA) or chronic insulin stimulation prevents interferon-α (IFN-α)-dependent IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and IFN-α-dependent IRS-1/phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) association. In addition, we demonstrate that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 renders it a poorer substrate for JAK1 (Janus kinase-1). We found that treatment of U266 cells with OA induced serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and completely blocked IFN-α-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IFN-α-dependent IRS-1/PI3K association. Additionally, IRS-1 from OA-treated cells could not be phosphorylated in vitro by IFN-α-activated JAK1. Chronic treatment of U266 cells with insulin led to a 50% reduction in IFN-α-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-1/PI3K association. More importantly, serine-phosphorylated IRS-1-(511–722) could not be phosphorylated in vitro by IFN-α-activated JAK1. Taken together, these data indicate that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 prevents its subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation by JAK1 and suggest that IRS-1 serine phosphorylation may play a counter-regulatory role in pathways outside the insulin signaling system.

Similarly, IRS-1 serine phosphorylation induced by phorbol esters, tumor necrosis factor-α, platelet-derived growth factor, angiotensin II, PI3Kassociated serine kinase (PAS kinase), and insulin reduces subsequent insulin receptor-dependent IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and IRS-1/PI3K association (27Kanety H.

Although much is known about the effect of IRS-1 serine phosphorylation on insulin signaling, nothing is known about the impact of IRS-1 serine phosphorylation on cytokine signaling. Here, we report that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 induced by either OA or chronic insulin stimulation inhibits IFN-α-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by JAK1 and blocks subsequent IRS-1/PI3K association. These findings indicate that IRS-1 serine phosphorylation may play a counter-regulatory role in signaling pathways outside the insulin system and suggest that hyperinsulinemia may alter signaling of JAK1- dependent cytokine receptors.

U266 cells were grown in growth medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% neonatal bovine serum, 2.0 g/liter glucose, 100,000 units/liter penicillin, and 100 mg/liter streptomycin). Cells were passaged 1:1 with fresh medium every 3 days. For OA treatment, cells were washed twice and resuspended in growth medium supplemented with 1 μm OA. For insulin treatment, cells were washed twice and resuspended in growth medium supplemented with 1 nm insulin. PI3K assays were performed as described previously (36Freund G.G. Kulas D.T. Way B.A. Mooney R.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3179-3185PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 20 × 106 cells/ml were treated as indicated and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 250 nm okadaic acid, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4). IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from lysates with 4 μl of anti-IRS-1 antiserum/test, and the resultant immune complexes were washed extensively. Kinase reactions were performed in 100 μl of buffer containing 0.33 mg/ml l-α-phosphatidylinositol, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm NaPO4, 7.5 μm[γ-32P]ATP (13 μCi/nmol), and 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.1, at 22 °C for 15 min. The assay conditions used were linear with respect to time and amount of kinase. Phospholipids were extracted with 1:1 chloroform/methanol and resolved on silica gel plates by TLC in chloroform/methanol/4 m ammonium hydroxide (75:58:17). Results were analyzed by autoradiography on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system. Western analysis was performed as described previously (37Cengel K.A. Godbout J.G. Freund G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In brief, 20 × 106cells/ml were treated as indicated and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer. Proteins of interest were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antiserum (4 μl/test), and the resultant immune complexes were washed extensively. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions on 10% gels, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with the indicated antiserum. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by secondary detection using an125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody, followed by autoradiography and densitometry. Cells (20 × 106/ml) were treated as indicated and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer. JAK1 was immunoprecipitated from lysates with 4 μl of anti-JAK1 antiserum/test, and the resultant immune complexes were washed extensively. Kinase reactions were performed in 100 μl of buffer containing 7.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmMnCl2, 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/nmol), and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, at 22 °C for 20 min with 5 μg/ml IRS-1-(511–772) or eluted IRS-1 or with no substrate as indicated. In reactions using eluted IRS-1 from U266 cells, IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from 20 × 106cells. The resultant immune complexes were eluted for 60 min at 37 °C in 10 μl of 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% SDS, 1 mg/ml bovine serum, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and used in kinase reactions at a 1:10 dilution. Kinase reactions were terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the assay conditions used were linear with respect to time and amount of kinase. Resultant phosphoproteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions on 7–20% gradient gels. Serine and threonine phosphoamino acids were base-hydrolyzed (39Dulcos B. Marcandier S. Cozzone A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were examined by autoradiography and densitometry. The coding sequence for amino acids 511–772 of IRS-1 was amplified from rat IRS-1 sequence (a kind gift of Morris F. White) by previously described methods (34Cengel K.A. Kason R.E. Freund G.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) using the forward primer 5′-CAGGATCCGATCTGGATAACCGGTTTC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GAGAATTCGCGCTGGGTGTGCTAAAAG-3′. This 799-base pair product was introduced into the pGex6P3 plasmid using the BamHI andEcoRI restriction sites. GST-IRS-1-(511–772) was produced as described previously (38Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). In brief, protein expression was induced in Escherichia coli strain BL21 by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 1 h, bacteria were lysed by mild sonication at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified from clarified lysates using glutathione-Sepharose, and GST was removed by digestion with 5 units of Precission protease at 4 °C. Whole cell phosphorylation was performed as described previously (37Cengel K.A. Godbout J.G. Freund G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In brief, 20 × 106 cells were suspended in 1 ml of phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.75 mCi/ml32Pi and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 1.5 h. For OA treatment, 1 μm OA was added at 1.5 h for 30 min. Cells were lysed, and IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated as described above. Phosphoproteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions on 8% gels. For phosphoamino acid analysis, phosphoproteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Bands of interest were excised and acid-hydrolyzed in 6 n constant boiling HCl for 2 h at 110 °C. Samples were treated with three cycles of water resuspension and evaporation and then resuspended in H2O/acetic acid/pyridine (89:10:1) running buffer containing 0.3 mg/ml phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine standards. Phosphoamino acids were separated on cellulose-coated plates by high voltage TLC, and standards were visualized with ninhydrin. Results were analyzed by autoradiography and densitometry. PAS kinase assays were performed as described previously (37Cengel K.A. Godbout J.G. Freund G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In brief, PAS kinase was purified from 20 × 106 cells by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-p85 protein. Kinase reactions were performed in 100 μl of reaction buffer containing 5 μg/ml IRS-1-(511–772), 0.4 mm EGTA, 0.4 mmNaPO4, 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP (100 μCi/nmol), and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, at 22 °C with or without 10 mm MgCl2 as a cofactor. For JAK1 kinase assays, IRS-1-(511–772) was prephosphorylated in the absence of [γ-32P]ATP and recovered by filtration through minifilter columns. IFN-α-activated JAK1 was isolated as described above, and JAK1 kinase assays using prephosphorylated IRS-1-(511–772) as a substrate were performed as described above. Reactions were terminated using SDS-PAGE loading buffer and were linear with respect to time and amount of kinase. Phosphoproteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions on 7–20% gradient gels and examined by autoradiography and densitometry. Cells (10 × 106/10 ml) were treated with 1 nm insulin for 18 h and then pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was lysed in 100 μl of ice-cold 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, by 10 passages through a 25-gauge needle. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant fraction was adjusted to 0.4 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm NaPO4, 0.9 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm[γ-32P]ATP (100 μCi/nmol), 45 mm Tris, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, at 22 °C with or without 10 mm MgCl2 as a cofactor. This kinase mixture was then added to affinity-purified GST-IRS-1-(511–772) (bound to glutathione-Sepharose), and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 22 °C. Reactions were terminated by addition of phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm EDTA and were linear with respect to time and amount of kinase. Phosphorylated IRS-1-(511–772) was then removed from the solid phase with Precision protease as described above. For JAK1 kinase assays, IRS-1-(511–772) was prephosphorylated in the absence of [γ-32P]ATP and then used in JAK1 kinase assays as described above at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. Serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 induced by OA treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes stops insulin-dependent activation of PI3K (26Tanti J.F. Gremeaux T. van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if IFN-α-mediated PI3K activation was prevented by OA, IRS-1-associated PI3K activity was examined in U266 cells pretreated with 1 μm OA for 30 min. Fig. 1 A demonstrates that 1000 units/ml IFN-α induced 20-, 22-, and 10-fold increases in IRS-1-associated PI3K activity at 5, 10, and 30 min, respectively, and that pretreatment of cells with OA blocked this response. OA did not inhibit PI3K activity directly because PI3K activity in PI3K p85 immune complexes from OA-treated cells was no different than that from non-OA-treated cells (data not shown). To determine if this failure to activate PI3K was due to a loss of IFN-α-dependent IRS-1/PI3K association, Western analysis was performed. Fig.1 B shows that IFN-α-dependent IRS-1/PI3K association was increased at 5, 10, and 30 min (as measured by Western detection of PI3K p85) and that OA inhibited this association. To determine if this OA-dependent decline in IRS-1/PI3K association was due to an inhibition of IFN-α-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, Western analysis was again performed. Fig. 1 C shows that IFN-α increased IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation at 5, 10, and 30 min and that OA blocked detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. To confirm that OA did not measurably alter IRS-1, p85, and JAK1 protein levels and the ability of these proteins to be immunoprecipitated by their respective antibodies, Western analysis was performed. Fig. 1 Ddemonstrates that IRS-1, p85, and JAK1 protein levels and their ability to be immunoprecipitated were unaffected by OA. Finally, to show that OA did not affect JAK1 autophosphorylation or its ability to phosphorylate in vitro substrates, JAK1 kinase assays were performed. Fig. 1 E demonstrates that JAK1 isolated from OA-treated cells phosphorylated recombinant IRS-1-(511–772) as well as JAK1 recovered from non-OA-treated cells and that JAK1 autophosphorylation was unchanged. Taken together, these findings indicate that OA blocks IFN-α-dependent IRS-1/PI3K association by a mechanism that inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, but does not alter JAK1 kinase activity. Serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 blocks insulin receptor-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (26Tanti J.F. Gremeaux T. van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol.

To determine if OA inhibited JAK1-dependent IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, JAK1 kinase assays were performed. Fig.2 A demonstrates that when IRS-1 isolated from OA-treated cells was used as a substrate for JAK1, IFN-α-dependent JAK1 phosphorylation was not observed. In contrast, when IRS-1 from non-OA-treated cells was used as a substrate for JAK1, IFN-α induced a 5-fold increase in JAK1-dependent IRS-1 phosphorylation. To examine the phosphorylation state of IRS-1 isolated from OA-treated cells, phosphoamino acid analysis was performed. These experiments showed that IRS-1 was predominantly phosphorylated on serine residues and that no tyrosine phosphorylation was detected (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, these findings indicate that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 induced by OA renders IRS-1 a poorer substrate for JAK1. Chronic hyperinsulinemia induces serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and reduces insulin signaling (33Paz K. Hemi R. LeRoith D. Karasik A. Elhanany E. Kanety H. Zick Y. J. Biol.

To determine if chronic insulin treatment inhibited IFN-α-dependent activation of PI3K, IRS-1-associated PI3K activity was examined in U266 cells pretreated with 1 nminsulin for 18 h. Fig. 3 Ademonstrates that 1000 units/ml IFN-α induced a 10-fold increase in IRS-1-associated PI3K activity at 5 min and that pretreatment of cells with insulin reduced this response by 50%. Chronic insulin treatment did not inhibit PI3K activity directly because PI3K activity in PI3K p85 immune complexes from insulin-treated cells was no different than that from non-insulin-treated cells (data not shown). To determine if this reduction in PI3K activation was due to a loss of IFN-α-dependent IRS-1/PI3K association, Western analysis was performed. Fig. 3 B shows that IFN-α increased IRS-1/PI3K association at 5 min (as measured by detection of PI3K p85) and that chronic insulin treatment reduced this association by 50%. To further examine the impact of chronic insulin treatment on IRS-1/PI3K association, IRS-1 present in PI3K immune complexes was examined by Western analysis (Fig. 3 C). As in Fig. 3 B, chronic insulin treatment reduced IFN-α-dependent IRS-1/PI3K association, and comparable low amounts of IRS-1 were associated with PI3K before and after chronic insulin treatment in cells not treated with IFN-α. To determine if this insulin-dependent decline in IRS-1/PI3K association after IFN-α treatment was due to an inhibition of IFN-α-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, Western analysis was again performed. Fig. 3 D shows that IFN-α increased IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation at 5 min and that chronic insulin treatment reduced IFN-α-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by 50%. Additionally, chronic insulin treatment did not alter JAK1 activity in that IFN-α-activated JAK1 isolated from chronically insulin-treated cells phosphorylated recombinant IRS-1-(511–772) as well as JAK1 recovered from non-insulin-treated cells (data not shown). Finally, to confirm that chronic insulin treatment did not measurably alter IRS-1, p85, and JAK1 protein levels and the ability of these proteins to be immunoprecipitated by their respective antibodies, Western analysis was performed. Fig. 3 E demonstrates that IRS-1, p85, and JAK1 protein levels and the ability to be immunoprecipitated were unaffected by chronic insulin treatment. Taken together, these findings indicate that chronic insulin treatment inhibits IFN-α-dependent IRS-1/PI3K association by a mechanism that reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, but does not alter JAK1 kinase activity. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 by serine kinases renders it a poorer substrate for the insulin receptor (27Kanety H. Feinstein R. Papa M.Z. Hemi R. Karasik A. J. Biol.

To determine if serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 inhibits its ability to act as a JAK1 substrate, kinase assays were performed. Fig.4 A shows that plasma membrane-depleted lysates from U266 cells treated with 1 nminsulin for 18 h contained kinase activity that phosphorylated IRS-1-(511–772) exclusively on serine residues. Fig. 4 Bdemonstrates that phosphorylation of IRS-1-(511–772) by plasma membrane-depleted serine kinase activity reduced by 50% the ability of IRS-1-(511–772) to serve as a substrate for IFN-α-activated JAK1. Fig. 4 C demonstrates that IRS-1-(511–772) was a substrate for the serine kinase PAS kinase (34Cengel K.A. Kason R.E. Freund G.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and that phosphorylation of IRS-1-(511–772) by PAS kinase reduced by 75% the ability of IRS-1-(511–772) to serve as a substrate for IFN-α-activated JAK1 (Fig. 4 D). These results indicate that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 inhibits its ability to act as a JAK1 substrate. These data establish that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 renders it a poorer substrate for JAK1. Western analysis and PI3K assays demonstrated that IFN-α-dependent IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and IRS-1/PI3K association and activity were blocked by OA treatment and that this was not due to an effect of OA on JAK1 (Fig.1, A–D). Isolation of IRS-1 from OA-treated cells showed that OA-dependent serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 completely inhibited the ability of IFN-α-activated JAK1 to phosphorylate IRS-1 (Fig. 2). Likewise, chronic insulin stimulation reduced by 50% the ability of IFN-α to stimulate IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and IRS-1/PI3K association and activity (Fig. 3). More importantly, serine phosphorylation of IRS-1-(511–772) by serine kinases derived from chronically insulin-stimulated cells and by PAS kinase reduced by 50 and 75%, respectively, the ability of IFN-α-activated JAK1 to phosphorylate IRS-1-(511–772) (Fig. 4). Taken together, these findings indicate that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 reduces the ability of IRS-1 to serve as a JAK1 substrate, that IRS-1 serine phosphorylation inhibits signal transduction in pathways outside the insulin system, and that hyperinsulinemia may alter signaling of JAK1-dependent cytokine receptors. Inhibition of PP1 and PP2A serine phosphatases by OA and calyculin A increase IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and leads to decreased insulin receptor-mediated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (26Tanti J.F.

Recently, the region of IRS-1 susceptible to chronic insulin treatment-dependent serine phosphorylation has been reported, and it appears to reside between amino acids 530 and 843 (35Sun X. Qiao L.

The kinase responsible for this phosphorylation is unknown, but appears to be insensitive to inhibitors of protein kinases C and A, PI3K, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (35Sun X. Qiao L. Goldberg J. Diabetes. 1998; 47 (abstr.): A35Google Scholar). We have identified a kinase (PAS kinase) that can serine phosphorylate IRS-1 and inhibit the ability of IRS-1 to serve as an insulin receptor substrate (34Cengel K.A. Kason R.E. Freund G.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 37Cengel K.A. Godbout J.G. Freund G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This kinase associates with the p85 subunit of PI3K through SH2 domain interactions and phosphorylates IRS-1 in IRS-1/PI3K complexes after insulin stimulation (37Cengel K.A. Godbout J.G. Freund G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Here, we show that PAS kinase can phosphorylate IRS-1-(511–772) and that this phosphorylation inhibits the ability of IFN-α-activated JAK1 to subsequently phosphorylate IRS-1-(511–772). Although serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 decreases the ability of the insulin receptor and now JAK1 to phosphorylate IRS-1, the mechanism of this effect is not clearly delineated. In the insulin signaling system, serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 within the IH1 phosphotyrosine-binding domain appears to impair NPXY-mediated IRS-1/insulin receptor association (33Paz K. Hemi R. LeRoith D. Karasik A. Elhanany E. Kanety H. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29911-29918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), thus abrogating direct IRS-1/insulin receptor interaction. Like the insulin receptor, the IL-4 receptor contains an NPXY motif, and this motif appears to coordinate the formation of receptor/JAK/IRS-1 complexes, which result in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (43Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M. Wang L.M. Pierce J.H. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The IFN-α receptor does not contain an NPXY motif and may rely on the IRS-1 IH1 pleckstrin homology domain to coordinate receptor/JAK/IRS-1 association and subsequent IRS-1 phosphorylation (8Platanias L.C. Uddin S. Yetter A. Sun X.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 278-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This suggests that serine phosphorylation within the IRS-1 IH1 pleckstrin homology domain might be important for preventing IFN-α-activated JAK1-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. We show here, however, that IFN-α-activated JAK1 can phosphorylate IRS-1-(511–772) and that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1-(511–772) inhibits this effect. This is important in that IRS-1-(511–772) does not contain either the IRS-1 IH1 pleckstrin homology or IH2 phosphotyrosine-binding domain and suggests that other regions of IRS-1 may be important in IRS-1/JAK1 interactions. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are prominent features in both syndrome X and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (44Reaven G.M. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). However, the pathogenesis of the multiple complications and conditions associated with these diseases is not yet understood (45Horton E.S. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1995; 28 (suppl.): S3-S11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We show here that chronic insulin treatment and IRS-1 serine phosphorylation decrease JAK1-mediated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and IRS-1/PI3K association, suggesting that cytokine signal transduction may be altered during hyperinsulinemia. Currently, a rapidly growing number of hormone and cytokine receptors appear to signal through JAK and IRS family members, and this appears to be critical to hormone/cytokine function (1Yenush L. White M.F. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This is most clearly understood in IL-4 signaling, where IRS function has been shown to be critical to IL-4-dependent mitogenesis and anti-apoptosis (4Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 46Zamorano J. Wang H.Y. Wang L.M. Pierce J.H. Keegan A.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4926-4934PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, site-specific mutagenesis of the phosphotyrosine-binding domain-binding motif in the IL-4 receptor reduces both IRS and STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation and abolishes the effect of IL-4 on the induction of DNA binding activity and CD23 induction (47Wang H.Y. Zamorano J. Keegan A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, by inducing IRS serine phosphorylation, hyperinsulinemia may potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of syndrome X/type 2 diabetes mellitus complications by disrupting JAK-mediated cytokine and hormone signaling pathways that use IRS. In summary, we show that OA and chronic insulin treatment inhibit IFN-α-dependent IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and IRS-1/PI3K association and activity. More importantly, we show that these effects are mediated by serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. We conclude that IRS-1 serine phosphorylation plays an inhibitory role in signaling pathways outside the insulin system and suggest that hyperinsulinemia may alter signaling of JAK1-dependent cytokine receptors through serine phosphorylation of IRS-1."

All cell surface-expressed mutant receptors bound N-formyl peptide with similar affinities as wild-type FPR, suggesting that the mutations did not affect the ligand-binding site. G protein coupling was examined by quantitative analysis ofN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-induced increase in binding of 35S-labeled guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) to membranes. The most prominent uncoupled FPR mutants were located in the N-terminal part of the second transmembrane domain (S63W and D71A) and the C-terminal interface of the third transmembrane domain (R123A and C124S/C126S). In addition, less pronounced uncoupling was detected with deletion mutations in the third cytoplasmic loop and in the cytoplasmic tail. Further analysis of some of the mutants that were judged to be uncoupled based on the [35S]GTPγS membrane-binding assay were found to transduce a signal, as evidenced by intracellular calcium mobilization and activation of p42/44 MAPK. Thus, these single point mutations in FPR did not completely abolish the interaction with G protein, emphasizing that the coupling site is coordinated by several different regions of the receptor. Mutations located in the putative fifth and sixth transmembrane domains near the N- and C-terminal parts of the third cytoplasmic loop did not result in uncoupling. These regions have previously been shown to be critical for G protein coupling to many other G protein-coupled receptors. Thus, FPR appears to have a G protein-interacting site distinct from the adrenergic receptors, the muscarinic receptors, and the angiotensin receptors.

Boulay F. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 39: 221-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). FPR binds bacterial and mitochondrial N-formylated peptides with high affinity in a G protein-dependent fashion, resulting in an intracellular signal transduction cascade that induces chemotaxis, calcium mobilization, superoxide production, and degranulation. Based on a number of studies, the ligand is believed to occupy a ligand binding pocket within the transmembrane regions (for reviews, see Refs.1Ye R.D. Boulay F. Adv.

The biological importance of FPR in host defense against bacterial infections was recently confirmed; Gao and co-workers (4Gao J.-L. Lee E.J. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) showed that mice with a targeted disruption of Fpr1, the mouse orthologue of human FPR1, had increased susceptibility to challenge with Listeria monocytogenes. formyl peptide receptor G protein-coupled receptor Chinese hamster ovary mitogen-activated protein kinase transmembrane domain N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate Previous studies analyzing G protein coupling to FPR have suggested that regions in the first and second cytoplasmic loop, fifth and sixth transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic tail of FPR are involved in the interaction with G protein; synthetic receptor-mimetic peptides corresponding to Gly43–Thr61, Ile119–Thr133, Asp122–Lys144, Gln134–Trp150, Phe210–Ile224, Lys230–Val246, and Arg322–Thr336 disturbed the formation of a FPR-Gi2 complex to various extents (IC50 20 μm to 1.4 mm), whereas Val127–Ser140, Lys227–Pro239, Met304–Ser319, Ala315–Thr329, Gln330–Glu344, and Asn337–Lys350 had a minor effect or no effect (see Fig. 1 A) (5Bommakanti R.K.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Another study using a similar approach provided evidence that peptides containing the amino acids Cys126–Arg137, Phe308–Arg322, and Ser319–Leu340 interacted with G protein, whereas Lys227–Arg241 and Thr339–Lys350 did not (Fig. 1 A) (7Schreiber R.E. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Cochrane C.G. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 326-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutagenesis studies suggested that a deletion of Lys230–Pro239 and various substitutions between residues 226 and 234 in the putative midportion of the third cytoplasmic loop did not have a critical role in G protein coupling (8Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A study using chimeras between FPR and C5a receptor showed that the first intracellular loop Arg54–Ile62 is necessary for ligand-dependent activation of Gα16 (9Amatruda III, T.T. Dragas-Graonic S. Holmes R. Perez H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28010-28013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The consensus from these studies is that the third cytoplasmic loop is not involved in G protein coupling, whereas all or parts of the other cytoplasmic domains do participate in the interaction. In addition to the cytoplasmic amino acids, certain highly conserved amino acids in the predicted transmembrane domains have been found to affect G protein coupling to various GPCRs. These residues include an asparagine in the first transmembrane domain (TMI), aspartic acid in the second transmembrane domain (TMII), aspartic acid and arginine in the third transmembrane domain (TMIII: (D/E)RY motif; DRC in FPR), and asparagine and tyrosine in the seventh transmembrane domain (TMVII: (N/D)PXXY motif). The most comprehensive analysis of G protein coupling was carried out through site-directed and computer-simulated mutagenesis of the α1B-adrenergic receptor. These studies showed that substitution of asparagine in TMI with an alanine (N63A) resulted in a constitutively active receptor (10Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In addition, a D142A mutation in the DRY motif of TMIII caused high constitutive activity, whereas a R143A mutation, also in the DRY motif, abolished inositol phosphate accumulation in response to ligand binding (10Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Similarly, Asp71 in TMII and Arg123 in the DRC motif of FPR appeared to be required for G protein coupling (11Prossnitz E.R. Schreiber R.E. Bokoch G.M. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10686-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Based on molecular dynamics simulations of the α1B-adrenergic receptor, Arg143 of the DRY motif is involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with Asp91, the conserved aspartic acid in TMII. This amino acid in turn forms a highly conserved polar pocket including the conserved asparagine in TMI and asparagine and tyrosine in TMVII (10Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Similar hydrogen bonding is also thought to take place in other GPCRs. In the wild-type gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, the conserved aspartic acid in TMII has been replaced with an asparagine, and the conserved asparagine in TMVII has been replaced with an aspartic acid. A N87D mutation resulted in loss of ligand binding and a D318N mutation resulted in abolished inositol phosphate production (12Cook J.V. Faccenda E. Anderson L. Couper G.G. Eidne K.A. Taylor P.L. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 139: R1-R4Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Zhou W. Flanagan C. Ballesteros J.A. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar). However, a double mutant N87D/D318N re-established inositol phosphate production (12Cook J.V. Faccenda E. Anderson L. Couper G.G. Eidne K.A. Taylor P.L. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 139: R1-R4Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Zhou W. Flanagan C. Ballesteros J.A. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a D120N substitution in TMII of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor eliminated coupling, but a D120N/N376D double mutant restored receptor function (14Sealfon S.C. Chi L. Ebersole B.J. Rodic V. Zhang D. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16683-16688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The purpose of the hydrogen bonding network is to stabilize the inactive form of the receptor (14Sealfon S.C. Chi L. Ebersole B.J. Rodic V. Zhang D. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16683-16688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, this hydrogen bonding network may be altered, allowing certain amino acid residues to interact with G protein (10Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To test the importance of equivalent amino acids in FPR, we made the following mutations of corresponding putative hydrogen bonding residues in FPR; N44A (TMI), D71A (TMII), D122A, R123A, R123G (TMIII), N297A, Y301A (TMVII), and D71N/N297D. In addition, we examined the effect of several other transmembrane domain point mutations and cytoplasmic deletion mutations. Although our results supported the hydrogen bonding network model, they also suggested that many of the G protein-interactive sites of FPR are distinct from other extensively studied GPCRs. cDNAs encoding point-mutated human FPRs were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using standard techniques (15Zoller M.J. Smith M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 6487-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar,16Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). The mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar). cDNA inserts coding for wild-type or mutant FPR were subcloned into theEcoRI site of pBGSA (18Uthayakumar S. Granger B.L. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 405-420PubMed Google Scholar). This vector contains an SRα promoter (19Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.-I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.-I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), transcription termination and polyadenylation signals from the human growth hormone gene, and a neomycin resistance cassette. The constructs were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using lipofectACE (Life Technologies, Inc.; Ref. 20Rose J.K. Buonocore L. Whitt M.A. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 520-525PubMed Google Scholar). Transfectants were selected with 0.5 mg/ml G-418 sulfate (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). 16 or 32 single colonies were isolated and tested for expression and cellular localization by immunofluorescence microscopy. Transfected CHO cells were maintained in selection medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 in α-modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. 14–16 h before each experiment, increased expression was induced by adding 6 mmsodium butyrate to the medium (21Gorman C.M. Howard B.H. Reeves R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7631-7648Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To examine receptor expression levels and localization in the cell, cells on coverslips were fixed and stained as described previously (22Miettinen H.M. Mills J.S. Gripentrog J.M. Dratz E.A. Granger B.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4045-4054PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected CHO cells were detached from culture plates with a cell scraper after incubation with 1 mm Na-EDTA (pH 8.0) in Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were filtered through a 44-μm Spectra/Mesh macroporous filter (Spectrum, Houston, TX), andN-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-fluorescein derivative (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was added to 1-ml cell volumes to give final concentrations ranging from 50 pm to 40 nm (or in some cases to 160 nm). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of fMLF. Following a 30-min incubation at 0° C, 10,000 cells from each peptide incubation mixture were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), and the K d values for the various receptors were determined by least squares analysis of the mean fluorescence intensity using the Prism program (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA). Quantum 25 fluorescein microbeads (Flow Cytometry Standards Corp., San Juan, PR) containing molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochromes ranging from 5 × 104to 2 × 106 were used as standards to determine the average number of FPRs on the cell surface. TheB max was calculated based on the sigmoidal binding curve. Cells were harvested as above and resuspended in 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4. Membranes were prepared by nitrogen cavitation at 4° C for 15 min at 400 p.s.i. The cavitates were cleared by a low speed centrifugation after which the membranes were pelleted for 30 min at 45,000 rpm in a Ti75 rotor. The membranes were resuspended in membrane binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4. The amount of membrane protein was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The membranes were either used immediately or frozen at −70° C. [35S]GTPγS assays were performed using 30 μg of membrane protein in 1 ml of membrane binding buffer. Samples were incubated with or without 1 μm fMLF in the presence of 0.5 μm GDP for 30 min at 30° C. [35S]GTPγS was added to 0.04 μCi/tube with or without 10 μm GTPγS to analyze for nonspecific [35S]GTPγS binding. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30° C and terminated by filtration through Whatman GF/C filters (Whatman International, Maidstone, United Kingdom), and the filters were washed three times with 2 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mmMgCl2. Filters were placed in 5 ml of scintillation fluid and counted in liquid scintillation counter. The counts generally ranged from 100 to 200 cpm for the control vials with excess unlabeled GTPγS to 1000–2000 cpm in the presence of fMLF and absence of unlabeled GTPγS. Cells were detached from culture plates as above and incubated with 2.5 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) in phosphate-buffered saline plus Ca2+/Mg2+ and 5% fetal bovine serum for 45 min at 37° C. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in the above buffer at room temperature, where they were left until the assay. Each measurement contained about 5 × 106 CHO cells in a volume of 1 ml. Continuous fluorescent measurements of calcium-bound and free Fura-2 were made at 37° C with a double excitation monochromator fluorescence spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Monmouth Junction, NJ) with excitation at 340 and 380 nm and emission at 510 nm. 10 μm ATP was added as a heterologous ligand to provide a standard stimulus for calcium mobilization. The amount of fMLF-induced calcium release was expressed as the percentage of ATP-induced calcium release (equal to 100%) using the value immediately before the fMLF addition (t = 48 s) as base line (equal to 0%). CHO transfectants were incubated with 100 nm fMLF at 37° C for 0, 1, 5, or 10 min and lysed with boiling Laemmli sample buffer. In some experiments, cells were preincubated 20 min with 500 ng/ml pertussis toxin or 100 nm wortmannin prior to a 5-min incubation with 100 nm fMLF. An equivalent of about 1 × 105cells was run on two 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred from the gels onto nitrocellulose membranes, and the MAPKs were detected with two different antibodies. The phosphorylated MAPKs, p44 and p42, were detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody against human p42/44 MAPK phosphorylated on Thr202 and Tyr204 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The total p42/44 MAPKs were detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated protein (New England Biolabs). The primary antibody incubations were followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody incubations and detection was carried out by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To examine the role of specific FPR structural features in receptor-G protein interaction, a number of amino acid residues, predicted to be either transmembrane or cytoplasmic, were mutated or deleted, and the mutant receptors were expressed in CHO cells. The amino acids that were mutated are shown in Fig. 1 Band Table I. The following mutations led to intracellular retention of the receptor in transfected CHO cells and were not examined further: single-amino acid substitutions in five positions (N44A, R54A, D122A, P213A, and P298A), two alanine insertion mutations (D122-AAA-R123 and L243-AAA-S244), and three deletion mutations (Δ128–135, Δ316–322, and Δ323–329) (see Fig.1 B, amino acids within thick circles). All mutant receptors that were found to be expressed on the cell surface showed a similar ligand binding affinity as wild-type FPR (Table I), suggesting that these mutations may not cause major structural changes that might account for uncoupling from G protein.Table ILigand binding affinity and G protein coupling to wild-type and mutant FPR expressed in CHO cellsAmino acid changesLocation of mutationNumber of receptors on the cell surfaceBinding affinityK d ± S.D.fMLF-induced increase in [35S]GTPγS binding to membranes ± S.E.nm%Wild type9.9 × 1056 ± 1120 ± 3 (4)N44ATMI: 18RetainedNDNDR54ACLI: 2RetainedNDNDH57SCLI: 56.0 × 10511 ± 6107 ± 20 (3)S63WTMII: 21.8 × 1067 ± 311 ± 1 (3)***S63C/Y64FTMII: 2 and 31.3 × 1066 ± 36 ± 6 (4)***D71ATMII: 105.8 × 1054 ± 13 ± 7 (5)***D71NTMII: 105.5 × 10522 ± 720 ± 5 (3)***D71N/N297DTMII: 10 and TMVII: 179.6 × 10511 ± 6113 ± 12 (4)C73STMII: 126.0 × 1055 ± 3107 ± 22 (3)D122-AAA-R123TMIII: 24–25RetainedNDNDD122ATMIII: 24RetainedNDNDR123ATMIII: 259.1 × 1058 ± 532 ± 10 (7)***R123GTMIII: 252.4 × 1053 ± 225 ± 2 (3)***C124S/C126STMIII: 26 and CLIII: 29.4 × 1056 ± 20 ± 26 (6)***Δ128–135CLII: 4–10RetainedNDNDK143ATMIV: 45.1 × 10514 ± 3124 ± 20 (4)P213ATMV: 14RetainedNDNDS220ATMV: 216.6 × 1059 ± 3113 ± 34 (7)Y221ATMV: 223.5 × 1058 ± 2132 ± 34 (7)L223A/L240ATMV: 24 and TMVI: 25.5 × 1054 ± 1100 ± 11 (3)I224ATMV: 254.6 × 1056 ± 2136 ± 21 (6)Δ229–234CLIII: 4–93.9 × 1052 ± 150 ± 15 (10)*R241ATMVI: 31.4 × 1052 ± 1122 ± 17 (3)L243-AAA-S244TMVI: 5–6RetainedNDNDL243ATMVI: 59.9 × 1056 ± 1149 ± 11 (4)V246ATMVI: 82.1 × 1052 ± 1115 ± 34 (5)C295STMVII: 158.9 × 1052 ± 132 ± 14 (6)**N297ATMVII: 178.1 × 1054 ± 1134 ± 20 (12)P298ATMVII: 18RetainedNDNDY301ATMVII: 212.3 × 1051 ± 0.534 ± 16 (9)**Δ309–315CT: 3–92.4 × 1052 ± 0.566 ± 25 (6)Δ316–322CT: 10–16RetainedNDNDΔ323–329CT: 17–23RetainedNDNDD327PCT: 213.2 × 1056 ± 490 ± 35 (5)Δ330–336CT: 24–304.5 × 1055 ± 0.538 ± 7 (5)***D333PCT: 275.1 × 1059 ± 582 ± 29 (4)The location for each mutation is assigned based on the Baldwin model for GPCR (see Fig. 1).

ND, not determined. To examine whether the mutations affect ligand-induced coupling to G protein, we analyzed the binding of [35S]GTPγS to membranes from CHO transfectants in the absence and presence of fMLF. The results are summarized in Table I. Substitutions of amino acids Ser63, Asp71, Arg123, Cys124/Cys126, Cys295, and Tyr301 resulted in uncoupling from G protein. Out of these, Asp71, Arg123, and Tyr301 are about 91–100% conserved among GPCRs (23Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar) and are believed to participate in G protein coupling in the α1B-adrenergic receptor through a hydrogen bonding network (10Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The D71A substitution caused the most dramatic uncoupling and a substitution with asparagine instead of alanine (D71N) did not restore the coupling activity, suggesting that the charged residue is required in this position. A fourth residue also considered important in the hydrogen bonding is asparagine in the (N/D)PXXY motif in the seventh transmembrane domain of GPCRs (10Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Contrary to our expectations, based on results from homologous substitutions on other GPCRs (12Cook J.V. Faccenda E. Anderson L. Couper G.G. Eidne K.A. Taylor P.L. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 139: R1-R4Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Sealfon S.C. Chi L. Ebersole B.J. Rodic V. Zhang D.

Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15407-15414Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the N297A mutation did not affect G protein coupling. This result was confirmed using another N297A clone from a separate transfection. However, a double mutant, D71N/N297D, restored the D71N defect and was able to couple to G protein, as has been previously shown for the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (13Zhou W. Flanagan C. Ballesteros J.A. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar). In various GPCRs, amino acids in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal interfaces between the third cytoplasmic loop and the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains have been shown to be important for G protein coupling (see “Discussion”). We mutated multiple sites in these regions (see Fig. 1 B); however, none of these mutations decreased the G protein coupling in response to fMLF. We also mutated amino acids in the first cytoplasmic loop (His57) and the carboxyl-terminal interface between the first cytoplasmic loop and the second transmembrane domain (Ser63). This is a region that is highly conserved among members of the FPR family including human FPR1, FPRL1 (also called the lipoxin A4 receptor; Ref. 25Fiore S. Maddox J.F. Perez H.D. Serhan C.N. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and FPRL2, rabbit FPR1, and mouse Fpr1, Fpr-rs1, Fpr-rs2, Fpr-rs3, Fpr-rs4, and Fpr-rs5 (26Gao J.-L. Chen H. Filie J.D. Kozak C.A. Murphy P.M. Genomics. 1998; 51: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 27Ye R.D. Quehenberger O. Thomas K.M. Navarro J. Cavanagh S.L. Prossnitz E.R. Cochrane C.G. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1383-1394PubMed Google Scholar). His57 in the middle of the putative first cytoplasmic loop is conserved between FPR1 and the mouse Fpr clones but is an arginine in FPRL1 and FPRL2 (Fig. 1 B). Substitution of this highly polar residue with serine did not affect G protein coupling (Table I). Ser63 in the putative second transmembrane domain is found in human and rabbit FPR1 and in mouse Fpr-rs2 and Fpr-rs4, whereas the residue is a cysteine in human FPRL1 and FPRL2, and mouse Fpr-rs3 and Fpr-rs5. A more dramatic substitution is found in mouse Fpr-rs1 and Fpr-rs2, where the residue is a tryptophan (26Gao J.-L. Chen H. Filie J.D. Kozak C.A. Murphy P.M. Genomics. 1998; 51: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The C5a receptor also has a tryptophan in this position (28Boulay F. Mery L. Tardif M. Brouchon L. Vignais P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2993-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A S63W substitution in FPR resulted in uncoupling of G protein (Table I). This result was somewhat unexpected, since the receptors in the FPR family and the C5a receptor are thought to be coupled to the same classes of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins. We also made a S63C substitution and, due to a planning error, an additional Y64F substitution, generating a S63C/Y64F double mutant (the C5a receptor has a phenylalanine in position 64). Like S63W, this S63C/Y64F double mutant was uncoupled from G protein. The serine residue in position 63 may thus be unique for G protein coupling to certain members of the FPR family of receptors. As shown in Table I, we mutated a number of transmembrane cysteine residues to serines. The purpose for these mutations was 2-fold: The first was to confirm the importance of Cys124–Cys126 in G protein coupling and explain the differential activities of Val127–Val140 (inactive; Ref. 6Bommakanti R.K. Dratz E.A. Siemsen D.W. Jesaitis A.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), Cys124-Thr138 (active; Ref. 7Schreiber R.E. Prossnitz E.R. Ye R.D. Cochrane C.G.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in inhibiting G protein coupling in reconstitution systems (see Fig. 1 A). The second was to prepare mutant FPR to carry out site-directed spin labeling studies. C73S substitution in the second transmembrane domain did not affect G protein coupling. In addition to human FPR, only Fpr1 has a cysteine in this position; all other mouse Fprs and rabbit FPR have a serine in this position. In contrast, Cys124 and Cys126 are conserved throughout the FPR-family. Cys124 is found in the DRC sequence in the putative third transmembrane domain (Fig. 1 B). Most G protein-coupled receptors have a tyrosine in this position, forming the conserved DRY motif. Other amino acids in this position are tryptophan and histidine (29Probst W.C. Snyder L.A.

https://openalex.org/W2079843900,"Retroviral Gag protein is sufficient to produce Gag virus-like particles when expressed in higher eukaryotic cells. Here we describe the in vitro assembly reaction of human immunodeficiency virus Gag protein, which consists of two sequential steps showing the optimal conditions for each reaction. Following expression and purification, Gag protein lacking only the C-terminal p6 domain was present as a monomer (50 kDa) by velocity sedimentation analysis. Initial assembly of the Gag protein to 60 S intermediates occurred by dialysis at 4 °C in low salt at neutral to alkaline pH. However, higher order of assembly required incubation at 37 °C and was facilitated by the addition of Mg2+. Prolonged incubation under these conditions produced complete assembly (600 S), equivalent to Gag virus-like particles obtained from Gag-expressing cells. Neither form disassembled by treatment with nonionic detergent, suggesting that correct assembly might occur in vitro. Electron microscopic observation confirmed that the 600 S assembly products were spherical particles similar to authentic immature human immunodeficiency virus particles. The latter assembly stage but not the former was accelerated by the addition of RNA although not inhibited by RNaseA treatment. These results suggest that Gag protein alone assembles in vitro, but that additional RNA facilitates the assembly reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2020479363,"The human fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 primary transcript is alternatively processed to produce receptor forms that vary in their affinity for fibroblast growth factor. The inclusion of a single exon (α) in normal brain glial cells produces a low affinity form of the receptor. Recognition of the α-exon is dysregulated during neoplastic transformation of glial cells to produce a high affinity receptor form. In this study, we have identified a second intronic repressor of RNA splicing located approximately 250 nucleotides upstream of the α-exon. Deletion or mutation of this sequence resulted in a significant increase in exon recognition in glioblastoma cells. This intronic repressor was found to share significant sequence homology with an intronic repressor element located downstream of the α-exon. The two repressor elements are functionally redundant in that they are capable of inhibiting α-exon recognition when positioned upstream or downstream of the exon. Finally, the elements were found to mediate enhanced exclusion of an unrelated exon, but only the repressors were placed flanking the exon. However, under these conditions, the cell-specific exon exclusion was no longer maintained. These results suggest that although the α-exon inclusion is actively repressed in glioblastomas, the absence of trans-activators appears to be key to the production of the high affinity form of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 in glioblastomas.

The underlying mechanisms involved in the regulated recognition of exons during RNA processing remain largely unknown (1Adams M.D. Rudner R.Z. Rio D.C. Curr. Opin.

FGFR-1 is a member of this complex gene family encoding membrane-associated tyrosine kinase receptors (5Green P.J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P.

Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). These receptors are widely expressed and have diverse functions that are mediated through the action of one or more of at least 14 FGF peptide ligands (5Green P.J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 6Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 7McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). FGFR-1 gene transcripts undergo regulated RNA processing that affects no fewer than 6 of the 20 coding exons (5Green P.J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 6Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 7McKeehan W.L.

The decision to include or exclude a specific exon greatly affects the functionality of FGFR-1. Alternative RNA splicing controls changes that occur in both receptor affinity and ligand specificity. Because FGFR plays a primary role in neural cell growth and differentiation pathways, precise maintenance of splicing regulation is critical. Dysregulation of FGFR-1 alternative splicing occurs in the malignant transformation of glial cells. In normal human glial cells, the predominantly expressed form of FGFR-1 (FGFR-1α) has three extracellular Ig-like domains involved in ligand binding. However, in glial cell tumors, the exclusion of a single exon (the α-exon) results in the production of a form of FGFR-1 (FGFR-1β) that has two Ig-like domains (8Yamaguchi F. Saya H. Bruner J. Morrison R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The absence of the third domain has been shown to give FGFR-1β an affinity for acidic and basic FGFs 10-fold greater than that of the FGFR-1α (9Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. Wang F. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Mol.

Predominant expression of this high affinity form of FGFR-1 in glial cells is believed to provide a cell growth advantage and to possibly contribute to glial cell malignancy. A reduction of FGFR-1 expression mediated by antisense oligonucleotides significantly reduces the growth of glioblastoma cells in culture (11Bansal R. Kumar M. Murray K. Morrison R.S. Pfeiffer S.E.

In previous studies, we established that cell-specific recognition of the α-exon is maintained in chimeric RNA transcripts (containing only the α-exon and flanking sequence) and that an exonic enhancer sequence is required for α-exon inclusion (13Cote G.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16170-16176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, in glioblastoma cells, intronic sequences are required to ensure α-exon skipping (15Jin W. Bi W. Huang E. Cote G.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 316-319PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the identification of a second regulatory intron sequence that is required to prevent α-exon inclusion. The element shares extensive sequence homology and was found to be functionally redundant with the previously identified downstream repressor (15Jin W. Bi W. Huang E. Cote G.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 316-319PubMed Google Scholar). The human astrocytoma cell line SNB-19 and the human choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3 were maintained as described previously (13Cote G.J.

Jin W. Morrison R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1054-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All of the constructs used, with the exception of pPPT-106 through pPPT-110, are derived from pFGFR-17 and maintain the same promoter (Rous sarcoma virus), flanking exons (human metallothionein 2A gene), and vector backbone (pGEM 4) (see Fig. 1 A). All deletion constructs were created using a multistep strategy involving the introduction of two HindIII sites by mutagenesis followed by deletion and self-ligation, except for constructs pFGFR-102 and pFGFR-104, where EcoRV restriction sites were used (see under “Mutagenesis,” below). The deleted regions are schematically indicated in individual figures (see Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and 5). The constructs pFGFR-101 and pFGFR-105 contain the ISS-2 element inserted 99 bp upstream of the α-exon. The ISS-2 insert was generated by PCR amplification of pFGFR-17 using primers FP99 and FP101. For pFGFR-101, this fragment was inserted by blunt-end ligation into the HindIII site of pFGFR-100. For pFGFR-105, the PCR fragment was inserted into pFGFR-103 following mutagenesis to create an upstream HindIII site and a deletion analogous to pFGFR-100. The construct pFGFR-103 contains a downstream ISS-1 that was inserted into the EcoRV site of pFGFR-102. The fragment containing the ISS-1 element was generated by amplification of pFGFR-17 using primers FP32 and FP39. The pPPT constructs all contain rat preprotachykinin gene exons 3–5 and use the cytomegalovirus promoter and bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal (see Fig. 6). The parent construct pPPT-106 was created by subcloning aHindIII/EcoRI fragment of RP 23 (generously provided by Paula Grabowski, University of Pittsburgh (16Kuo H.C. Nasim F.H. Grabowski P.J. Science. 1991; 251: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)) into pCR 3.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The HindIII site was destroyed by blunt-end ligation prior to subsequent cloning steps. The insertion of the upstream ISS-1 (pPPT-107) was accomplished in multiple cloning steps. Intronic HindIII and KpnI restriction sites were introduced into pPPT-106 by mutagenesis. The ISS-1 element was inserted as a primer dimer of FP153 and FP154. A fragment containing the ISS-2 element was inserted in a similar manner. Downstream intronic HindIII and KpnI restriction sites were introduced by mutagenesis. The insert was created as a larger PCR product using primers FP151 and FP152, which were ligated into the downstream intron and finally reduced to 62 bp by an internal deletion to create pPPT-108. Construct pPPT-109 followed an identical cloning strategy; however, pPPT-107 was used as the starting vector. The final construct, pPPT-110, contains inactivating mutations of the ISS-1 and ISS-2 elements. Mutation of the ISS-1 was performed using primers FP162 and FP163. This mutation is analogous to pFGFR-M2. The ISS-2 mutagenesis used primers FP134 and FP161 and is analogous to pFGFR-91 (15Jin W. Bi W. Huang E. Cote G.J.

The values presented are for three independent transfections ± S.D. Representative autoradiographs of the transfection results are shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All of the mutations were introduced using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In some cases, the procedure was modified to employ three primers in the reaction as described previously (14Jin W. Huang E.S.-C. Bi W. Cote G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16170-16176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 15Jin W. Bi W. Huang E. Cote G.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 316-319PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of the constructs required at least two independent mutagenic steps with different primer combinations to obtain the final plasmid. Detailed information on the creation of specific plasmids will be provided upon request. All of the constructs have been sequenced to confirm the specific nucleotide changes. All of the transfections were performed using DOSPER liposomal reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Briefly, the day before a transfection, 800,000 JEG-3 cells or 1 million SNB-19 cells were plated into a 35-mm dish in a 6-well plate. On the day of a transfection, a DNA/DOSPER mixture (1:6 ratio) was incubated at room temperature for 45 min. The mixture was then diluted by adding 4 ml of serum-free medium and added to each well. Ten to 15 μg of DOSPER was used for the transfection, which was allowed to proceed for 6 h prior to changing to serum-containing medium. All of the plasmids were prepared using the JetStar Isolation Kit (Genomed, Research Triangle Park, NC) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the purity and integrity of each preparation was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. mRNA was isolated 72 h after transfection using the mRNA Capture kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and reverse transcription-PCR reactions were performed as described previously (14Jin W. Huang E.S.-C. Bi W. Cote G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16170-16176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). All PCRs were performed in a 50-μl solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dNTPs, 5 units of Taq polymerase, 0.3 μm hMT2/3 downstream primer, 0.25 μmunlabeled DS8 primer, and 0.03 μm32P-end-labeled DS8 forward primer. Primers used to analyze the RNA derived from the pPPT clones were T7 and FP82. PCR products were then analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Quantification and statistical analysis of exon inclusion were performed as described previously (14Jin W. Huang E.S.-C. Bi W. Cote G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16170-16176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Individual values for the percentage of exon inclusion were derived, following subtraction of background counts and then averaged to obtain the mean value ± S.D. for a minimum of three independent transfections. A rat genomic sequence was derived from the genomic P1 clone DMPC-HFF 12694, which was obtained from Genome Systems, Inc. (St. Louis, MO), by providing the oligonucleotide primers that map to the α-specific exon for the FGFR-1gene (FP52 and FP53). DMPC-HFF 12694 was subjected to EcoRI digestion, and the resultant fragments were subcloned into pBluescript using standard methodology. Clones containing the α-exon were identified by colony hybridization using labeled FP52 as a probe. The genomic sequence was obtained from a single positive clone using a combination of standard and automated sequencing. The DNA oligonucleotide primers used were as follows: FP11, 5′-GGGGAAGCTTGCAAGACACCTCCAGGT-3′; FP12, 5′-GGGGAGTACTACACGTACCTTGTAGCC-3′; FP26, 5′-GATGGTGCGGCTAAGCTTGGCCAGCGTAAT-TC-3′; FP27, 5′-GAATTACGCTGGCCAAGCTTAGCCGCACCATC-3′; FP32, 5′-GTCCTGGGGAGGGCCAAGCTTTCCCCTTAG-3′; FP33, 5′-CTAAGGGGAAAGCTTGGCCCTCCCCAGGAC-3′; FP37, 5′-GGTGTTCCTCTGGCAAGCTTCAATCTTGGCAAA-3′; FP38, 5′-CTAACTTTGCCTCTAAGCTTCTTTGACTTTTGG-3′; FP39, 5′-CCAAAAGTCAAAGAAGCTTAGAGGCAAAGTTAG-3′; FP40, 5′-CTGTTTTCCCCACTAAGCTTTGCTCCAATTCCC-3′; FP44, 5′-CCCGCATCACAGGGGAGGAG-3′; FP52, 5′-GAGTC-CCTGTGGAAGTG-3′; FP53, 5′-GAAGTAGGTGGTATCGCTGC-3′; FP54, 5′-GGAAATGAAATGTGATAAGCTTAATGCTGC-3′; FP79, 5′-GGAGATCCAAGCTTGTATCA-GCTAG-3′; FP80, 5′-CTAGCTGATACAAGCTTGGATCTCC-3′; FP81, 5′-ATGCTGCTACAGAAGCTTCCTAACTTTGC-3′; FP-82, 5′-GTGAGAGATCTGACCATGCC-3′; FP-86, 5′-GGATTGGGTTAGATTAAGCTTTACCTCGCTACAGTG-3′; FP-87, 5′-CACTGTAGCGAGGTAAAGCTTAATCTAACCCAATCC-3′; FP88, 5′-GCTTAATGCTGCTACAGAAGAAAAATAACTTTGCCTCTTTC-3′; FP89, 5′-GCTGCTTCCTAACTAAGAAAAATTCTTCCTTTGAC-3′; FP91, 5′-GTGATCCGCTTAAAGAAGAAACAGCTGCTTCCTAAC-3′; FP99, 5′-CTCCTCCCCCTCCGATATCTGCCCCCACTCTGC-3′; FP-101; 5′-CCTCTCTGAGAGCCAGATATCGCGGCAGGCAGGG-3′; FP-134; 5′-CACTCTGCTTCAGAAACAAAAAACCACTAACA-TTGCTCCC-3′; FP149, 5′-GCTTTACCTCGGTACCGTGATAGGAATT-3′; FP150, 5′-AGATCTTGAATTGGTACCATCAAAAGCTTTTTACATGA-3′; FP151, 5′-CTCCCCC-TCCAAGCTTTGCCCCCACTCTGC-3′; FP152, 5′-GTGACTATAGGGTACCCCAGGCAGGTC-3′; FP153, 5′-AGCTAATGCTGCTACAGCTGCTTCCTAACTTTGCCTCTTTCTTC-3′; FP154, 5′-GTACGAAGAAAGAGGCAAAGTTAGGAAGCAGCTGTAGCAGCATT-3′; FP161, 5′-GGGAGCAATGTTAGTGGTTTTTTGTTTCTGAAGCAGAGTG-3′; FP162, 5′-AGCTAATGCTGCTACAGAAGAAAAATAACTTTGCCTCTTTCTTC-3′; FP163, 5′-GTACGAAGAAAGAGGCAAAGTTATTTTTCTTCTGTAGCAGCATT-3′; αR, 5′-CTCCTCCCCTGTGATGCGGG-3′; DS8, 5′-TTGACCATTCACCACATTGGTGTGC-3′; HMT2/3, GCAGCAGGAGCAGCAGCTTT-3′; and T7, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′. Previous studies have shown that the exclusion of the α-exon from the final FGFR-1 mRNA strongly correlates with glial-cell malignancy (8Yamaguchi F. Saya H. Bruner J. Morrison R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To test this finding, we established a cell culture model system capable of cell-specific recognition of the α-exon during RNA processing of minigene-derived transcripts. The construct pFGFR-17 contained a 4-kilobase fragment of the FGFR-1 gene inserted into the splicing reporter RSV/hMT2 (Fig. 1 A) (13Cote G.J. Huang E.S.-C. Jin W. Morrison R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1054-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Transcripts derived from this construct showed α-exon-specific inclusion in JEG-3 cells and α-exon-specific exclusion in SNB-19 cells (glioblastoma cells); the α-exon was included in only 20% of the transcripts (Fig.1 B). Deletion of the intron sequence upstream of the α-exon in pFGFR-17 was previously shown to dramatically up-regulate α-exon recognition in SNB-19 cells (13Cote G.J. Huang E.S.-C. Jin W. Morrison R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1054-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This result was thought to be largely nonspecific, because substitution of the deleted sequence with nonspecific sequence resulted in a rescue of the phenotype. We decided to reexamine the regulatory role of the flanking intron sequences when quantitative analysis revealed a consistent enhancement of α-exon inclusion in sequence replacement constructs compared with pFGFR-17 (not shown). Three constructs containing progressive deletions beginning at the 5′ end of the FGFR-1 insert were examined for α-exon inclusion in transfected SNB-19 and JEG-3 cells (Fig.1 B). In the SNB-19 cell line, we observed a biphasic increase in α-exon inclusion (Fig. 1 B). For constructs pFGFR-22 and pFGFR-50, a 20% increase in α-exon inclusion was observed. This increase may have resulted from the decrease in intron size (from about 2500 nucleotides to about 500 nucleotides). Further deletion of the α-intron sequence resulted in a dramatic increase in α-exon inclusion in SNB-19 cells to a level comparable with that observed in JEG-3 cells (construct pFGFR-51) (Fig. 1 B). In the JEG-3 cells, the level of α-exon inclusion was modestly affected by the reduction of intron size, from 80% (pFGFR-17) to 92% (pFGFR-51) (Fig. 1 B). The deletion constructs localize a potential SNB-19 cell-specific inhibitor of α-exon inclusion to an upstream intron region between nucleotides −242 and −322. To definitively assign an inhibitory element to this region, we tested constructs containing smaller deletions targeted to this region (Fig.2). The pFGFR-57 construct contains a 77-bp internal deletion mapped to the region identified in Fig. 1. In transfected SNB-19 cells, this construct showed the same dramatic increase in α-exon inclusion seen for deletion construct pFGFR-51 (from 20 to 67%) (Fig. 2). Similarly sized deletions in sequence flanking the 77-nucleotide region had no effect on the level of α-exon inclusion in transfected SNB-19 cells (pFGFR-56 and pFGFR-58) (Fig. 2). No significant difference in the level of α-exon inclusion was observed for any of these constructs in transfected JEG-3 cells (Fig. 2). In addition, similar levels of α-exon inclusion were also seen in cells stably transfected with pFGFR-17 and pFGFR-57 (data not shown). Two final deletion constructs narrowed the inhibitory element to a 40-nucleotide region located 251 nucleotides upstream of the start of the α-exon. This small deletion had a dramatic effect on exon inclusion in SNB-19 cells (an increase from 20 to 68%), with little change in exon inclusion in JEG-3 cells (80 versus 84%). Therefore, these constructs identify a role for a specific sequence, which we have termed ISS-1, in addition to intron size, as a cell-specific inhibitor of α-exon inclusion. To aid in the search for cis-regulatory elements, we concurrently obtained clones of the rat FGFR-1 gene in order to perform a sequence comparison. The conservation of sequences has been noted among many reported cis elements involved in the regulation of alternative splicing (17Chan R.C. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6377-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18Lou H. Yang Y. Cote G.J. Berget S.M. Gagel R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7135-7142Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Philips A.V. Timchenko L.T. Cooper T.A. Science. 1998; 280: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 20Ryan K.J. Cooper T.A Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4014-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This turned out to be the case for theFGFR-1 gene as well. The region deleted from pFGFR-D1 had 37 of 40 nucleotides conserved in both the human and rat genes, whereas the sequence flanking this region was considerably less conserved (data not shown). This suggested that the entire 40-nucleotide region might serve as a functional element. Comparison of this region with previously identified intronic regulatory elements revealed two functional possibilities: the repeated UGC motif and a possible PTB-binding motif (UCUU in a pyrimidine-rich environment) (15Jin W. Bi W. Huang E. Cote G.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 316-319PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Moreau G. Nadal-Ginard B. Smith C.W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3861-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Smith C.W.J. RNA. 1998; 4: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar, 23Perez I. Lin C.H. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. RNA. 1997; 3: 764-778PubMed Google Scholar). Another potential sequence of interest is the direct repeat GCUGCUacaGCUGCU (Fig. 3). To distinguish between the functional significance of these motifs, we generated additional deletion and mutation constructs. Deletion of the 5′ half of the region (pFGFR-D2) (Fig. 3) removed three of the four UGCs and the GCUGCUacaGCUGCU repeat while leaving the PTB-binding region intact. This deletion enhanced α-exon inclusion to a level similar to that observed for pFGFR-D1 (Fig. 3), suggesting that PTB is not directly responsible for the inhibition of α-exon recognition. However, a second deletion removing two of the four UGCs, half of the GCUGCUacaGCUGCU repeat, and the PTB-binding motif was also observed to elevate α-exon inclusion in transfected SNB-19 cells (pFGFR-D3) (Fig.3). Unfortunately, the UGCs elements interspersed within the GCUGCUacaGCUGCU repeat are difficult to target specifically. Therefore, five additional constructs containing mutations scanning the 40-nucleotide region were created. Mutations targeting the 5′ half of the 40-nucleotide region (pFGFR-M1 and pFGFR-M2) (Fig. 3) enhanced α-exon inclusion to a level similar to that of pFGFR-D2. A fortuitous consequence of the introduction of a central HindIII site was a 2-nucleotide purine substitution (pFGFR-M3) (Fig. 3). A fourth mutation targeted a single UGC and the PTB-binding motif (pFGFR-M4) (Fig. 3). Both pFGFR-M3 and pFGFR-M4, which removed one of the four UGC motifs, displayed a partial phenotype, suggesting that the UGC motif, not the PTB-binding motif, regulates cell-specific inhibition of α-exon inclusion. This is further supported by the observation that the pFGFR-M5 construct, which specifically targets the PTB-binding motif, did not affect the splicing phenotype (Fig. 3). We previously identified a 62-bp sequence (ISS-2) beginning 97 bp downstream of the α-exon, which, when deleted, also resulted in enhanced exon inclusion in SNB-19 cells (Fig. 4) (15Jin W. Bi W. Huang E. Cote G.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 316-319PubMed Google Scholar). Like the ISS-1 sequence, mutation analysis found that exclusion of the α-exon in SNB-19 cells required the presence of a repeated UGC motif (Fig. 4). A comparison of the two elements found that they contained remarkable sequence homology in addition to the UGC motif (Fig. 4). This suggested that these two elements might be functionally redundant. To address this possibility, constructs were created in which the ISS-1 and ISS-2 elements were interchanged (Fig. 5). We first tested to see whether the ISS-2 would substitute for the ISS-1 element (pFGFR-101) (Fig. 5). In transfected SNB-19 cells, α-exon inclusion was nearly identical to that of the parent construct pFGFR-17 (22 versus 20%) (Fig. 5). This confirmed that the ISS-2 element could substitute for ISS-1. To determine whether the reverse was also true, an analogous replacement of the ISS-2 element with ISS-1 was performed (pFGFR-103) (Fig. 5). Again, the level of α-exon inclusion observed was nearly identical to the parent construct pFGFR-17 (26 versus 20%) (Fig. 5). In JEG-3 cells, the level of α-exon inclusion for both constructs was similar to pFGFR-17, and slightly lower compared with their deletion clones (Fig.5). Finally, we simultaneously swapped the positions of the two elements (Fig. 5, pFGFR-105). Once again, the cell-specific pattern of α-exon inclusion continued to be maintained. Therefore, the ISS-1 and ISS-2 elements are clearly functionally redundant and function in a position independent manner. Furthermore, both elements appear to be required for the maximal exclusion of the α-exon in SNB-19 cells. Deletion of either the ISS-1 or ISS-2 element significantly enhances α-exon inclusion in SNB-19 cells, but removal of both elements results in a nearly 100% level of α-exon inclusion in both cell types (pFGFR-104) (Fig. 5). Therefore, it appears that in the context of the pFGFR-17 construct, each individual element does maintain some degree of its inhibitory function. The deletion and element-swapping experiments clearly establish a role for the ISS-1 and ISS-2 elements in α-exon inclusion in the SNB-19 cells. To help clarify the mechanism by which these elements function, we attempted to recapitulate regulated exon exclusion for an unrelated gene. Transcripts derived from the preprotachykinin gene are alternatively processed to produce mRNAs encoding substance P, neurokinin A, and a related tachykinin peptide (24Kawaguchi Y. Hushimaru M. Nawa H. Nakanishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 25Krause J.E. Chirgwin J.M. Carter M.S. Xu Z.S. Hershey A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Of the three mRNAs produced from this gene, the γ mRNA, which lacks exon 4, appears to be the most abundant (25Krause J.E. Chirgwin J.M. Carter M.S. Xu Z.S. Hershey A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The mechanism of exon 4 exclusion has been well characterized and is completely dependent on the presence of a suboptimal 5′ splice site (16Kuo H.C. Nasim F.H. Grabowski P.J. Science. 1991; 251: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, this seemed like an ideal candidate gene. An in vivo splicing reporter construct (pPPT-106) was generated by subcloning a genomic fragment containing exons 3 through 5 into the mammalian expression vector pCR 3.1 (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Transcripts derived from this construct showed exon 4 was included at a slightly higher level in inclusion in SNB-19 cells (77%) compared with JEG-3 cells (59%), indicating the absence of any major cell-specific regulatory effects (Fig. 6). To determine whether the ISS elements could function in a heterologous context, they were inserted into analogous positions within the introns flanking exon 4. Insertion of the ISS-1 element into the upstream intron did not decrease exon 4 inclusion in either cell line (pPPT-107) (Fig. 6). A similar result was observed when the ISS-2 element was placed in the downstream intron (pPPT-108) (Fig. 6). However, a consistent reduction in exon 4 inclusion was observed when both elements were simultaneously included (pPPT-109) (Fig. 6). In SNB-19 cells, the level of exon 4 inclusion dropped ∼37% compared with levels observed for pPPT-106 (Fig. 6). A similar decrease was seen in JEG-3 cells, indicating that the action of these elements is not cell-specific. The inhibition was specific to the two elements because inactivating mutations restored splicing to wild-type levels in both cell lines (pPPT-110) (Fig.6). In this study, we have identified a second intronic sequence that plays a key role in the regulated exclusion of the α-exon during processing of the FGFR-1 primary transcript. This element, which we have termed ISS-1, is located upstream of the α-exon, whereas the previously identified ISS-2 element is located in the downstream intron (see Fig. 4). The positioning of regulatory elements flanking the regulated α-exon seems appropriate. An emerging theme among exons that undergo alternative recognition is that their splice-site sequences are generally recognized less efficiently (1Adams M.D. Rudner R.Z. Rio D.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 2Chabot B. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 472-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 3Hertel K.J. Lynch K.W. Maniatis T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 4Manley J. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of exon recognition involves cell-specific enhancement or repression of a weak constitutive event. We have previously identified a unique exonic sequence that mediates cell-specific enhancement of α-exon inclusion (14Jin W. Huang E.S.-C. Bi W. Cote G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16170-16176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The data presented here indicate that recognition of the α-exon is also actively repressed using multiple elements to ensure exon skipping. Regulation of exon recognition by employing an active enhancer/repressor system has been noted for other alternatively recognized exons. Exonic silencing elements have been found in two human immunodeficiency virus genes and in bovine papillomavirus (26Si Z.H. Amendt B.A. Stoltzfus C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Wentz M.P. Moore B.E. Cloyd M.W. Berget S.M. Donehower L.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8542-8551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Zheng Z.M. He P.J. Baker C.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4691-4699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these examples, the repressor elements are juxtaposed with a splicing enhancer that is required for exon inclusion. It is thought that the binding of the repressor then acts to inhibit enhancer function. Multiple enhancer and repressor elements are also found for the FGFR-2 gene (29Delgatto F. Plet A. Gesnel M.C. Fort C. Breathnach R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5106-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One of theFGFR-2 elements also appears to have a dual function by acting to enhance inclusion of the upstream exon while simultaneously inhibiting downstream exon recognition (30Carstens R.P. McKeehan W.L. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2205-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have no evidence for either mechanism in α-exon splicing. Deletion analysis did not detect significant enhancer activity flanking the ISS-1 repressor (Fig. 2) or repressor sequences flanking the α-exon enhancer element (14Jin W. Huang E.S.-C. Bi W. Cote G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16170-16176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Additionally, both repressors function in a heterologous context suggesting that their inhibitory action is mediated through disruption of constitutive rather than enhancer-dependent exon recognition (Fig. 6). A second class of repressors is mediated through the actions of PTB (31Garcia-Blanco M.A. Jamison S.F. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1874-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 32Valcarcel J. Gebauer F. Current Biol. 1997; 7: R705-R708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For a growing number of mammalian genes, α- and β-tropomyosin, GABAA receptor γ 2, c-src, fibronectin, and α-actinin, the repression of exon recognition has been specifically linked to regulatory elements that bind PTB (22Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Smith C.W.J. RNA. 1998; 4: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar, 23Perez I. Lin C.H. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. RNA. 1997; 3: 764-778PubMed Google Scholar,33Ashiya M. Grabowski P.J.

In each of these examples, the PTB-binding sequences are found juxtaposed with the constitutive splicing signals, particularly the branch-point sequence rather than enhancer elements. Inhibition of exon inclusion is believed to occur by interfering with U2 snRNP association with the branch site (33Ashiya M. Grabowski P.J. RNA. 1997; 3: 996-1015PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the ISS-1 repressor sequence identified in this study is predicted to bind PTB, it is located a considerable distance from the presumed branch point (Fig. 5). In addition, mutation of the PTB-binding consensus sequence had only a moderate effect on in vivo α-exon inclusion (Fig. 3). Instead, the UGC motifs appear to play a critical role for both the ISS-1 and ISS-2 elements. Similar UGC motifs are found in the two repressor elements that flank exon 3 of the α-tropomyosin gene and mediate muscle-specific splicing (21Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Moreau G. Nadal-Ginard B. Smith C.W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3861-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Smith C.W.J. RNA. 1998; 4: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar, 23Perez I. Lin C.H. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. RNA. 1997; 3: 764-778PubMed Google Scholar). Like the FGFR-1repressors, both regulatory sequences are composed of a UGC-rich region with a downstream polypyrimidine-rich tract (21Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Moreau G. Nadal-Ginard B. Smith C.W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3861-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Smith C.W.J. RNA. 1998; 4: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar, 23Perez I. Lin C.H. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. RNA. 1997; 3: 764-778PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of the UGC motif in a single repressor is sufficient to disrupt of exon skipping (21Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Moreau G. Nadal-Ginard B. Smith C.W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3861-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Smith C.W.J. RNA. 1998; 4: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar, 23Perez I. Lin C.H. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. RNA. 1997; 3: 764-778PubMed Google Scholar). The α-tropomyosin gene repressor UGC-rich region is recognized by a novel 55-kDa protein, whereas the downstream polypyrimidine-rich domain binds PTB (22Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Smith C.W.J. RNA. 1998; 4: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar, 39Roberts G.C. Gooding C. Smith C.W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6301-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which these proteins regulate exon exclusion remains to be addressed. Whether these specific proteins or similar ones recognize the FGFR-1 ISS-1 and ISS-2 elements is unknown. In this study, we have begun to address the underlying mechanisms involved in the regulated recognition of the α-exon during processing of the FGFR-1 RNA precursor. Whereas the FGFR-1gene is widely expressed, recognition of the α-exon appears to be limited to the brain. It has been speculated that because inclusion of this exon results in a receptor form with reduced affinity for ligands, this RNA splicing pattern may be important in end-stage differentiated cells (11Bansal R. Kumar M. Murray K. Morrison R.S. Pfeiffer S.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 12Morrison R.S. Yamaguchi F. Saya H. Bruner J. Yahanda A. Donehower L. Berger M. J. Neuro-oncol. 1994; 18: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This is further supported by the observation that glial cell malignancy is associated with a loss of RNA splicing regulation. Therefore, it is easy to infer that α-exon inclusion is highly regulated and that α-exon exclusion represents the default pathway. Our results support this conclusion; however, we have clearly established that recognition of the α-exon is actively repressed. The localization of repressor elements flanking the exon suggests a mechanism involving coordinated repression of both the 3′ and 5′ splice sites. This is also supported experimentally by the observations that deletion of a single ISS element is sufficient to enhance the level of α-exon inclusion and that both elements are required to inhibit PPT exon 4 inclusion. Because the ISS-1 and ISS-2 elements are functionally redundant, the trans-regulatory factors recognizing these elements would have to be capable of preventing productive association of both U2 snRNP and U1 snRNP at the their respective splice sites. Female-specific RNA splicing of the sex lethal protein in Drosophila utilizes just such a mechanism. Multiple repressor elements flanking the male-specific exon 3 are capable of binding the sex lethal protein. The RNA-bound sex lethal protein then interacts via sans-fille protein with U1 and U2 snRNP to prevent splicing (40Deshpande G. Samuels M. Schedl P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5036-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Inclusion of the male-specific exon 3 occurs in the absence of the “sex lethal” protein. For FGFR-1, an alternative mechanism must exist, as the ISS elements are capable of enhancing PPT exon 4 exclusion in JEG-3 cells, which predominantly include the α-exon. Because recognition of the α-exon requires the presence of an enhancer element, it would appear that this pathway is dominant over the inhibitory pathway. Precisely sorting out the regulatory mechanism by which the α-exon is differentially regulated will require determining the specific proteins that associate with these elements."

The enhancer of these viruses is epithelial-specific, as it fails to activate transcription from heterologous promoters in nonepithelial cell types (Gloss, B., Bernard, H. U., Seedorf, K., and Klock, G. (1987) EMBO J. 6, 3735–3743; Morgan, I. M., Grindlay, G. J., and Campo, M. S. (1999) J. Gen. Virol. 80, 23–27). Studies on E2 transcriptional regulation of the human mucosal epitheliotropic papillomaviruses have been hindered by poor access to the natural target cell type and by the observation that some of the human papillomavirus promoters, including human papillomavirus-16, are repressed in immortalized epithelial cells. Here we present results using the bovine papillomavirus-4 (BPV-4) LCR and a bovine primary cell system as a model to study the mechanism of E2 transcriptional regulation of mucosal epitheliotropic papillomaviruses and the cell type specificity of this regulation. E2 up-regulates transcription from the BPV-4 LCR preferentially in epithelial cells (Morgan, I. M., Grindlay, G. J., and Campo, M. S. (1998) J. Gen. Virol.79, 501–508). We demonstrate that the epithelial-specific enhancer element of the BPV-4 LCR is not required for the enhanced activity of E2 in epithelial cells and that the BPV-4 promoter is more responsive, not only to E2, but to other transcriptional activators in epithelial cells. This is the first time a level of epithelial specificity has been shown to reside in a papillomavirus promoter region.

Human papillomaviruses (HPV) 1The abbreviations used are:HPVhuman papillomavirusbpbase pair(s)LCRlong control regionBPVbovine papillomavirusPalKpalate keratinocytesPalFpalate fibroblaststkthymidine kinaseNFnuclear factor are a family of small double-stranded DNA viruses that infect epithelial cells causing benign proliferative lesions. Certain types have been implicated in the development of carcinomas with over 90% of human cervical cancers containing viral sequences of a high risk HPV subtype, predominantly HPV-16 and -18 (3zur Hausen H. Virology. 1991; 184: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). All papillomaviruses have a noncoding region of 500–1000 bp called the long control region (LCR). The LCR is the transcriptional control unit of the virus regulating expression of the viral-transforming proteins and of the proteins essential for the viral life cycle. The LCR is a typical transcriptional control unit with a promoter region and an upstream enhancer region (4Desaintes C. Demeret C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mucosal epitheliotropic LCRs, for example HPV-16 and -18, contain an epithelial-specific enhancer, and it is therefore proposed that one of the restrictions of these viruses to their target cell type is at the transcriptional level. human papillomavirus base pair(s) long control region bovine papillomavirus palate keratinocytes palate fibroblasts thymidine kinase nuclear factor Bovine papillomavirus-4 (BPV-4) is a mucosal epitheliotropic papillomavirus that infects the upper alimentary canal of cattle causing benign papillomas with a high risk of progressing to carcinoma in cattle feeding on bracken fern (5Campo M.S. Oneil B.W. Barron R.J. Jarrett W.F.H. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The BPV-4 LCR has an organization similar to other mucosal epitheliotropic papillomaviruses. The epithelial-specific enhancer is of a similar size and position as that in the HPV-16 and -18 LCRs. There are two main regions contributing to enhancer activity. One of these sites, Site 2, has a corresponding sequence in the LCR of HPV-16 (6Morgan I.M. Grindlay G.J. Campo M.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). All papillomavirus LCRs contain binding sites for virally encoded E2; expression of which is controlled by the LCR. The E2 gene product is a 45–48-kDa protein that binds to the 12-bp palindromic DNA sequence -ACCGNNNNCGGT- as a dimer (for a review, see Ref. 7Ham J. Dostatni N. Gauthier J.M. Yaniv M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 440-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All E2 proteins have three functional domains: an amino-terminal acidic transactivation domain, a carboxyl-terminal DNA binding and dimerization domain, and a central variable hinge region (8Giri I. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2823-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As well as regulating transcription, E2 is required for replication of the viral genome (9Demeret C. Le Moal M. Yaniv M. Thierry F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4777-4784Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Sedman J. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6218-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 11Ustav M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and is therefore essential for the viral life cycle. The amino terminus of E2 can interact with E1, the major viral replication factor, directing it to the origin of replication. Disruption of this interaction is sufficient to prevent viral DNA replication in vitro (12Kasukawa H. Howley P.M. Benson J.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8166-8173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the E2 transactivation domain has demonstrated that the ability of E2 to regulate transcription and replication can be separated, indicating that the cellular proteins with which E2 interacts to carry out these two functions are different (13Ferguson M.K. Botchan M.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4193-4199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Grossel M.J. Sverdrup F. Breiding D.E. Androphy E.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7264-7269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several E2 molecules, including BPV-1 E2, BPV-4 E2, and HPV-16 E2, up-regulate transcription from the BPV-4 LCR in an epithelial-specific manner (2Morgan I.M. Grindlay G.J. Campo M.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). 2I. M. Morgan and K. W. Vance, unpublished observation. The inability of E2 to up-regulate transcription in fibroblasts is promoter-specific as E2 can activate transcription from heterologous promoters in a variety of cell types (15Cripe T.P. Haugen T.H. Turk J.P. Tabatabai F. Schmid P.G. Durst M. Gissmann L. Roman A. Turek L.P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3745-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 16Romanczuk H. Thierry F. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2849-2859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Thierry F. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3391-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). When studying the ability of E2 to up-regulate transcription from HPV LCRs, the cell type employed seems crucial. In primary human keratinocytes E2 up-regulates transcription from the HPV-16 promoter (18Bouvard V. Storey A. Pim D. Banks L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5451-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, most studies have been carried out using transformed keratinocyte cell lines where E2 represses transcription from HPV LCRs. This repression is mediated by the E2 binding site 3 bp upstream from the TATA box (16Romanczuk H. Thierry F. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2849-2859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Steger G. Corbach S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 50-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the overall LCR sequence homology between BPV-4 and HPV-16 and -18 is low, the distribution of E2 binding sites within these LCRs is identical. Immediately upstream from the TATA box are two E2 binding sites separated from each other and the TATA box by 3 or 4 base pairs. There are also two upstream sites; one is beside the E1 DNA binding site involved in the regulation of viral DNA replication, and one is a further 300–400 bp upstream. The conservation of the organization of these sites through evolution strongly suggests that the mechanism E2 uses to regulate transcription from these LCRs is conserved. To study the mechanisms of E2 transcriptional regulation of mucosal epitheliotropic papillomaviruses and the tissue specificity of this regulation, we used the BPV-4 LCR and primary bovine palate keratinocytes (PalK) and palate fibroblasts (PalF). Comparisons are made between the results in PalK cells, the natural target cell type for transformation by BPV-4, with PalF cells from the same source. E2 up-regulates transcription from the BPV-4 LCR in PalK cells but not in PalF cells (2Morgan I.M. Grindlay G.J. Campo M.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Low to intermediate levels of E2 up-regulate transcription from the BPV-4 LCR, whereas at elevated levels of E2, transcription is down-regulated. This down-regulation is mediated by E2 interaction with the TATA proximal E2 DNA binding site, presumably disrupting the TATA box-binding protein-TATA box contact and therefore decreasing the rate of transcriptional initiation (2Morgan I.M. Grindlay G.J. Campo M.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate that the BPV-4 LCR epithelial-specific enhancer element is not required for the enhanced activity of E2 in keratinocytes. We show that the BPV-4 promoter is more responsive to transcriptional activators in PalK cells than in PalF cells, whereas the tk promoter shows no such epithelial preference. This is the first time a level of epithelial specificity has been shown to reside in a papillomavirus promoter region. The pGL3 PV, pGL3 PV1, and pGL3 PV2 constructs were generated as follows. A BPV-4 LCR promoter fragment from nucleotide 184–310 was polymerase chain reaction amplified as a BglII-HindIII fragment from pLCR, pLCR-E2(3)mt1, and pLCR-E2(d/3) (20Jackson M.E. Campo M.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6038-6046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These fragments were then cloned into the pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (Promega). Increasing numbers of synthetic E2 binding sites were cloned into theBglII site immediately upstream of the BPV-4 promoter. Oligonucleotides used were as follows: upper strand, 5′-GATCCACCGAAAACGGTCGGGACCGAAAACGGTA; lower strand, 5′-GATCTACCGTTTTCGGTCCCGACCGTTTTCGGTG. When annealed together, a pair of E2 sites separated by 4 base pairs with BamHI/BglI compatible ends is generated. After end-labeling with T4 kinase and ligation, the double-stranded oligonucleotides were restriction digested withBamHI/BglII. This ensures that only concatamers of E2 binding sites facing in the same orientation are generated as ligation in the wrong orientation reconstitute a restriction site. LexA binding sites were generated in the same manner. Oligonucleotides used were as follows: upper strand, 5′-GATCCTGCTGTATATAAAACCAGTGGTTATATGTACAGTAA; and lower strand, 5′-GATCTTACTGTACATATAACCACTGGTTTTATATACAGCAG, which when annealed generates a single colE1 operator with cutBamHI/BglII ends. The oligonucleotides were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel; the bands corresponding to 2, 4, 6, and 8 binding sites were excised, eluted overnight in minimal volume of elution buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.5 m NH4OAc, 10 mm MgOAc), and purified by LiCl and EtOH precipitation. The tk promoter from nucleotide 75–199 was polymerase chain reaction cloned as a BglII-HindIII fragment into pGL3. The fidelity of all plasmid constructions was verified using an ABI 373A automated sequencer. pCMV HPV16-E2, pCGBPV1-E2, and pCGVP16-E2 have been described previously (2Morgan I.M. Grindlay G.J. Campo M.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 18Bouvard V. Storey A. Pim D. Banks L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5451-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). VP16-LexA was a gift from Dr. Chris Bartholomew (Glasgow Caledonian University). PalK cells were prepared from fetal biopsies as described for human cervical keratinocytes (21Cuthill S. Sibbet G.J. Campo M.S. Mol. Carcinogen. 1993; 8: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). They were cultured on irradiated Swiss 3T3 feeders in the conditions described (20Jackson M.E. Campo M.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6038-6046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Swiss 3T3 feeders were grown in simple liquid medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum and irradiated with 60 grays prior to use as feeders. PalF cells were prepared as described (22Jaggar R.T. Pennie W.D. Smith K.T. Jackson M.E. Campo M.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 3041-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) from the same palate biopsy used to prepare the PalKs and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. At least two different sources of these primary cell types were used in the experiments described. PalK cells were transfected using the polybrene-Me2SO technique as described (23Jiang C.-K. Connolly D. Blumenberg M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 969-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were seeded on a 60-mm tissue culture dish without feeders. The following day the medium was replaced with 10 mg/ml polybrene containing medium, and the DNA was added. After 6 h the DNA-polybrene containing medium was removed, and a 35% Me2SO solution was added to the cells for 3 min. Following this incubation the cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and then refed with normal medium. The cells were harvested 44–48 h later. PalF cells were transfected using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation technique. Briefly, cells were plated out at 2 × 105/60-mm tissue culture disc. The following day a calcium phosphate precipitate containing the DNA was added to the cells overnight. The following morning the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and refed with normal medium. The cells were harvested 28–32 h later. PalK and PalF cells were lysed directly on the tissue culture plates. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. 300 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) was added to the plate and left for 10 min. The cell lysate was then scraped from the dish and placed in a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube. The lysate was cleared by centrifuging the sample for 10 min and removing the supernatant to a fresh tube. 80 μl of the supernatant were then assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega) with a BioOrbit 1251 or a Tropix TR717 microplate luminometer (Figs. 5 b and 7). To standardize for cell number, the protein concentration was determined. pGL3CONT, which contains the SV40 promoter- and enhancer-driving expression of the luciferase gene, was transfected in parallel to confirm efficient transfection. This construct demonstrates high levels of transcriptional activity in both keratinocytes and fibroblasts. All transfections were repeated at least three times in duplicate.Figure 7HPV-16 E2 activates transcription from the tk promoter in a cell type-independent manner. PalK and PalF cells were cotransfected with tk 6E2 and the indicated amounts of pCMV HPV-16 E2 expression vector. 1 μg of reporter construct was used in each assay and the total amount of DNA transfected was made equal by the addition of pCMV. Results are expressed as fold transactivation over the luciferase activity in the absence of E2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PalK and PalF cells were transfected with increasing amounts of pCMV HPV16-E2 expression vector. Cells were lysed on ice in 50 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol), sonicated, and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance measurement at 280 nm. 50 μg of each sample were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (ECL Hybond, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were incubated with a TVG261 monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope in the amino-terminal region of HPV-16 E2 (24Hibma M.H. Raj K. Ely S.J. Stanley M. Crawford L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) followed by an anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase. Western blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The BPV-4 LCR has an enhancer that functions in epithelial cells but not in fibroblasts (6Morgan I.M. Grindlay G.J. Campo M.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 a). Also, E2 up-regulates transcription from the BPV-4 LCR in epithelial cells but not in fibroblasts (2Morgan I.M. Grindlay G.J. Campo M.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). There are three possible reasons for this epithelial-specific function of E2: the E2 protein functions more efficiently in epithelial cells, E2 may interact with the epithelial-specific enhancer to regulate transcription, or the LCR promoter may show an enhanced epithelial response to transcriptional activators. To determine which of these possibilities are responsible, the epithelial-specific enhancer was removed and a series of concatamers of increasing numbers of E2 binding sites were cloned upstream from the BPV-4 promoter in the position of E2 BS3 (Fig.1 b). Mutations were introduced into the TATA box proximal E2 sites preventing E2 binding (Fig. 1 b) as these sites have previously been shown to mediate down-regulation of transcription at high levels of E2 (2Morgan I.M. Grindlay G.J. Campo M.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 20Jackson M.E. Campo M.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6038-6046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This yielded a series of plasmids with the following nomenclature: the PV series represents the wild type LCR promoter sequence; and the PV1 series has the TATA proximal E2 DNA binding site mutated, whereas the PV2 series has both the TATA proximal and the adjacent E2 site mutated (see Fig. 1 b for details). Increasing numbers of E2 DNA binding sites were then inserted upstream from these promoters: 2, 4, 6, and 8 copies of E2 DNA binding sites inserted PV 2E2 (2 E2 sites), PV 4E2 (4 E2 sites), etc. In PalK and PalF these plasmids have similar background transcriptional activity (i.e. there is no enhanced activity in the epithelial cells). Also, in the absence of E2 protein the E2 sites do not enhance transcription, and without the LCR promoter sequences E2 does not activate transcription, indicating that there is no cryptic promoter in the reporter plasmid that is responsive to E2 (data not shown). HPV-16 E2, which functions in an identical manner to BPV-4 E2,2 can specifically bind to the E2 sites inserted upstream from the LCR promoter constructs. We chose to study the effects of HPV-16 E2 on these promoter constructs in PalK and PalF as HPV-16 E2 is functionally identical to BPV-4 E2 in regulating transcription from the LCR. HPV-16 is a causative agent in a number of human diseases, and understanding the function of HPV-16 proteins will present opportunities for interfering with the viral life cycle. In PalK cells, HPV-16 E2 up-regulates transcription from the LCR promoter in an additive manner increasing as the number of E2 binding sites increases (Fig. 2). A maximum of 20-fold activation of transcription (over the background activity of no E2) is observed with the PV1 8E2 and PV2 8E2 constructs. PV1 6E2 and PV2 6E2, which both have the TATA proximal E2 site (BS1) mutated, have a 2–3-fold elevated response over the PV 6E2 construct (Fig. 2). This is in agreement with previous studies showing that BS1 is responsible for mediating down-regulation of transcription by elevated levels of E2. To determine if the epithelial-specific response of the full-length LCR is retained by the promoter region, the transcriptional response to HPV-16 E2 of the PV1 6E2 construct was assayed in both PalK and PalF cells. PV1 6E2 was chosen as E2 BS1 is mutated in this construct eliminating down-regulation of transcription by elevated levels of E2 as a complicating factor. Low levels of E2 are sufficient to up-regulate transcription from the BPV-4 promoter in PalK cells. 10-fold activation is observed at a 1:1 ratio of E2 expression vector to reporter plasmid (Fig. 3 a). Over a range of increasing E2 concentrations the BPV-4 promoter is not up-regulated more than 2-fold in PalF cells (Fig. 3 a). Fig.3 b shows that E2 is being expressed at similar levels as a doublet of approximately 42 kDa in both PalK and PalF cells. These results demonstrate that the BPV-4 promoter mimics the response of the full-length LCR to transcriptional up-regulation by E2, that is, the response is much enhanced in PalK cells. They also demonstrate that the epithelial-specific enhancer element of the BPV-4 LCR is not required for the enhanced activity of E2 in PalK cells. It has been proposed that the epithelial-specific transcriptional regulation of the LCR promoter may be mediated by the E2 transactivation domain (2Morgan I.M. Grindlay G.J. Campo M.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis we assayed the ability of a chimeric molecule that has the VP16 transactivation domain fused to the BPV1 E2 DNA binding domain and of wild type BPV1 E2 to activate transcription from the PV2 6E2 construct. VP16 is a strong acidic transactivator from the herpes simplex virus. BPV-1 E2 activates transcription 18-fold in PalK cells but no more than 2-fold in PalF cells, demonstrating that the preferential activation in epithelial cells is retained with BPV-1 E2 (Fig. 4 a). VP16-E2 also activates transcription from PV2 6E2 better in PalK cells than in PalF (Fig. 4 b). At low levels VP16-E2 activates transcription 180-fold in fibroblasts and 900-fold in keratinocytes. At high levels of VP16-E2 transcription is down-regulated in both cell types. This may be because of squelching where excess VP16-E2 proteins not bound to DNA sequester factors required for transcriptional activation. These results demonstrate that the E2 transactivation domain is not solely responsible for the enhanced function of E2 on the BPV-4 promoter in epithelial cells. Two components of the cellular basal transcription initiation complex, TATA box-binding protein and transcription factor IIB, have been shown to interact directly with the carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain of E2 (25Rank N.M. Lambert P.F. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6323-6334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the contribution of the DNA binding domain of E2 to cell type-specific transcriptional activation, four copies of the LexA site from the colE1 promoter were cloned upstream of the BPV-4 promoter with both TATA box proximal E2 binding sites mutated (Fig.5 a). The ability of a chimeric molecule, which has the VP16 transactivation domain fused to the bacterial LexA DNA binding domain, to activate transcription from this construct was assayed in PalK and PalF cells. At low to intermediate levels VP16-LexA activates transcription to a similar degree in both cell types. However, the BPV-4 promoter shows a 5-fold enhanced epithelial response to activation by high levels of VP16-LexA. A 1:1 ratio of expression vector to reporter plasmid up-regulates transcription approximately 200-fold in fibroblasts and 1000-fold in keratinocytes (Fig. 5 b). This difference is similar to that observed with VP16-E2. These results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal region of E2 is not involved in mediating epithelial-specific transcriptional regulation of the LCR promoter but functions to localize active E2 dimers to the target promoter. To address the possibility that E2 binding to its target sequences was being blocked in fibroblasts and that the enhanced epithelial response to transcriptional activators was a specific property of the BPV-4 promoter, six E2 binding sites were cloned upstream from the herpes simplex virus tk promoter (Fig.6 a). The tk promoter has similar background transcriptional activity in both PalK and PalF cells in the absence of E2 (data not shown) and is approximately the same length as the PV promoter so that the E2 molecules are operating from a similar distance. The ability of VP16-E2 to up-regulate transcription from the tk 6E2 construct was assayed, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 b. It is clear that the VP16-E2 chimera is being expressed, binding to its target sites and activating transcription in both PalK and PalF cells. At low levels VP16-E2 activates transcription from the tk promoter preferentially in PalF cells. At intermediate levels VP16-E2 activates transcription to a similar degree in both cell types, whereas at high levels of VP16-E2 transcriptional activity is down-regulated probably because of a squelching mechanism. To further investigate the contribution of the E2 transactivation domain to epithelial specificity, the ability of E2 to up-regulate transcription from the tk 6E2 construct was assayed in PalK and PalF cells. Fig. 7 shows that E2 up-regulates transcription from the tk promoter in a cell type-independent manner. A maximum of approximately 90-fold activation is observed with a 0.1:1 ratio of expression vector to reporter plasmid in both cell types. These results demonstrate that the tk promoter does not show an epithelial preference to activation by both VP16-E2 and E2 itself. In PalK cells, the natural target cell type for transformation by BPV-4, E2 up-regulates transcription from the BPV-4 promoter in an additive manner increasing as the number of E2 binding sites increases (Fig. 2). Such an additive effect of pairs of E2 sites has been observed previously (26Thierry F. Dostani N. Arnos F. Yaniv M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4431-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Gauthier J.M. Dostani N. Lusky M. Yaniv M. New Biol. 1991; 3: 498-509PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ham J. Dostatni N. Arnos F. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2931-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Over a range of increasing E2 concentrations the BPV-4 promoter is not transactivated more than 2-fold in PalF cells (Fig. 3 a). Failure to function in PalF cells is not because of a lack of expression, as Fig. 3 bshows E2 is being expressed at similar levels as a doublet of approximately 42 kDa in both PalK and PalF cells. The BPV-4 promoter shows an enhanced epithelial response to activation, not only by E2, but also by VP16-E2 (Fig. 4 b) and VP16-LexA (Fig. 5 b). The enhanced epithelial response is a promoter-specific effect as the tk promoter shows no such epithelial preference to activation by VP16-E2 (Fig. 6 b) and E2 itself (Fig. 7). Previously we have suggested that the E2 protein contributes toward epithelial-specific transcriptional regulation of the BPV-4 LCR (2Morgan I.M. Grindlay G.J. Campo M.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Whereas this remains a possibility for the LCR promoter, it is clearly not true for the tk promoter. Transactivators are believed to function, at least in part, through contacting components of the cellular transcription machinery and affecting the formation and/or stability of the preinitiation complex. E2 has previously been shown to bind transcription factor IIB, TATA box-binding protein, Sp1, and AMF-1 (25Rank N.M. Lambert P.F. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6323-6334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ham J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 7208-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is possible that a combination of interactions with these factors contributes to epithelial specificity or that there are as yet unidentified factors that may be responsible. The 127-bp BPV-4 promoter region used here contains the TATA box and presumably as yet unidentified core promoter elements but does not have a putative initiator element. Previously it has been suggested that there is an initiator in the BPV-4 promoter just downstream from the TATA box (32Connolly J.A. Morgan I.M. Jackson M.E. Campo M.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2739-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The addition of this putative initiator to the BPV-4 promoter sequence used here resulted in a slight elevation in response to E2 but played no role in the epithelial-specific response to E2.2 Previous studies have shown that a core promoter must contain at least two elements to be able to respond to E2 and that such elements, the TATA box, the initiator element, or a binding site for an upstream promoter factor, are interchangeable to a large extent (33Ham J. Steger G. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore E2 requires the co-operation of at least one additional DNA binding proximal promoter factor, such as Sp1, or other factors that interact with papillomavirus promoters, such as AP-1, Oct-1, NF-1/CTF, or USF for the activation of a minimal TATA box promoter (28Ham J. Dostatni N. Arnos F. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2931-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 34Ushikai M. Lace M.J. Yamakawa Y. Kono M. Anson J. Ishiji T. Parkkinen S. Wicker N. Valentine M.E. Davidson I. Turek L.P. Haugen T.H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6655-6666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epithelial-specific functions of some of these factors have emerged. NF-1 proteins are the products of a multigene family. Epithelial cells contain proteins derived from the NF1-C gene (NF-1/CTF), but in fibroblasts where the HPV-16 enhancer is inactive, high levels of the negative regulator derived from the NF1-X gene are expressed (35Apt D. Liu Y. Bernard H.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3825-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Sp1 is one of at least four ubiquitously expressed transcription factors derived from a multigene family (36Hagen G. Dennig J. Preiß A. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Sp3 acts as a repressor probably because of competition with Sp1 for the same binding sites (37Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). In HPV gene expression Sp1 binds a single site close to the E6 promoter (38Gloss B. Bernard H.U. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5577-5584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Hoppe-Seyler F. Butz K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6701-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 40Dollard S.C. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In various epithelial and fibroblast cell lines high levels of Sp1 compared with Sp3 are consistently found where the HPV-16 promoter is active and low levels are found where it is inactive (41Apt D. Watts R.M. Suske G. Bernard H.U. Virology. 1996; 224: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The Sp1 protein can become phosphorylated and glycosylated and might thus be a target of intracellular signaling (42Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar,43Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). However, none of the consensus binding sites for these factors are present in the BPV-4 promoter. Therefore the sequential action of as yet unidentified proximal promoter factors, either cell type-specific or ubiquitous factors differentially expressed or modified in a cell type-dependent manner, may be involved in determining the enhanced epithelial response of the BPV-4 promoter to upstream activators. As well as upstream elements, the TATA box itself may be involved in cell type-specific transcriptional regulation. Previous studies have shown that the TATA sequence and core promoter sequences around the TATA box can dictate cell type-specific transcriptional regulation and the response to upstream activators (44Tamura T. Sumita K. Hirose S. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3101-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 45Wefald F.C. Devlin B.H. Williams R.S. Nature. 1990; 344: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 46Das G. Hinkley C.S. Herr W. Nature. 1995; 374: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cell type-specific forms of TFIID or a specific set of non-DNA binding cofactors may be recruited to the BPV-4 LCR promoter allowing E2 and VP16 to utilize a different subset of coactivators in PalK and PalF cells to activate transcription. Alternatively, it is possible there is a repressor protein(s) that is either specific to, more abundant, or alternatively modified in fibroblasts that inhibits the ability of VP16 and E2 to activate transcription from the viral promoter in this cell type. This may explain why E2 is unable to activate transcription in fibroblasts, but VP16, which has a stronger transactivation domain, is able to partly overcome this negative regulation. VP16-E2 up-regulates transcription from the BPV-4 promoter 180-fold in fibroblasts and 800-fold in keratinocytes (Fig. 4 b). Negative regulation of HPV-16 gene expression has been attributed primarily to the effects of the transcription factor YY1 (47O'Connor M.J. Tan S.H. Tan C.H. Bernard H.U. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6529-6539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of cellular negative regulators of viral gene expression has become apparent as studies of primary tumors or metastases were found to contain nonintegrated HPV-16 episomes with mutated YY1 sites (48May M. Dong X.P. Beyer-Finkler E. Stubenrauch F. Fuchs P.G. Pfister H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1460-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Evidence also exists for the presence of a fibroblast repressor on the short arm of chromosome 11. The HPV-16 enhancer-promoter is virtually inactive in normal human diploid fibroblasts but active in human fibroblasts with a deletion in the short arm of one chromosome 11 (del-11 cells). Because the HPV-16 enhancer upstream of the SV40 promoter is active in both normal fibroblasts and del-11 cells, the target for chromosome 11-regulated HPV expression is likely to be located in the HPV-16 early promoter region (nucleotides 57–112) (49Smits P.H.M. Smits H.L. Minnaar R.P. ter Schegget J. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). More recently, a novel YY1-independent silencer present in the HPV-16 LCR promoter that can repress the HPV-16 enhancer has been identified (50O'Connor M.J. Stunkel W. Zimmermann H. Koh C.H. Bernard H.U. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10083-10092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, negative regulators of transcription may play a role in limiting the expression of viral proteins to the host cell type. Identification of the DNA elements and proteins involved in mediating the enhanced epithelial response of the BPV-4 LCR promoter to upstream activators is currently under investigation. This will lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying not only mucosal epitheliotropic papillomavirus transcriptional control but also cell type-specific transcription in general.

https://openalex.org/W2031961928,"Conformational stability of the p53 protein is an absolute necessity for its physiological function as a tumor suppressor. Recent in vitro studies have shown that wild-type p53 is a highly temperature-sensitive protein at the structural and functional levels. Upon heat treatment at 37 °C, p53 loses its wild-type (PAb1620+) conformation and its ability to bind DNA, but can be stabilized by different classes of ligands. To further investigate the thermal instability of p53, we isolated p53 mutants resistant to heat denaturation. For this purpose, we applied a recently developed random mutagenesis technique called DNA shuffling and screened for p53 variants that could retain reactivity to the native conformation-specific anti-p53 antibody PAb1620 upon thermal treatment. After three rounds of mutagenesis and screening, mutants were isolated with the desired phenotype. The isolated mutants were translated in vitro in either Escherichia colior rabbit reticulocyte lysate and characterized biochemically. Mutational analysis identified 20 amino acid residues in the core domain of p53 (amino acids 101–120) responsible for the thermostable phenotype. Furthermore, the thermostable mutants could partially protect the PAb1620+ conformation of tumor-derived p53 mutants from thermal unfolding, providing a novel approach for restoration of wild-type structure and possibly function to a subset of p53 mutants in tumor cells.

Activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein appears to be an integrating mechanism in response to cellular stresses such as DNA damage and oxidative stress (1Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D.

Three separate functional domains at p53 have been identified. In the N terminus (amino acids 1–43) lies the transcriptional transactivation activity of the protein (8Fields S. Jang S.K. Science. 1990; 249: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 9Raycroft L. Wu H.Y. Lozano G. Science. 1990; 249: 1049-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 10Scharer E. Iggo R.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), whereas amino acids 100–290 form a protease-resistant hydrophobic core that is responsible for the sequence-specific DNA-binding activity (12Bargonetti J. Manfredi J.J. Chen X. Marshak D.R. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar,13Wang Y. Schwedes J.F. Parks D. Mann K. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2157-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The C terminus is composed of an oligomerization domain (amino acids 319–360) and a region that negatively regulates the sequence-specific DNA-binding activity of p53 (14Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 15Halazonetis T.D. Kandil A.N.

Point mutations in the p53 gene have been identified in 50% of human tumors, indicating that p53 inactivation is an important step in tumor progression (17Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7461) Google Scholar, 18Hollstein M. Marion M.J. Lehman T. Welsh J. Harris C.C. Martel Planche G. Kusters I. Montesano R.

Devilee P. Glover T. Collins F.S. Weston A. Modali R. Harris C.C. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1989; 342: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (2572) Google Scholar). The majority of these mutations (>90%) cluster in the central core domain of the protein and are responsible for the loss of the biological activity of p53 (20Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2556-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 21Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar). More specifically, these mutations involve either residues that make direct contact with DNA (“contact mutants”) or residues that provide structural stability and proper positioning of the DNA contact residues (“structural mutants”). Examples of contact mutants include Arg-248 and Arg-273, and those of structural mutants include Arg-175, Gly-245, Arg-249, and Arg-282 (22Arrowsmith C.H. Morin P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1379-1385PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, many of the point mutations identified in the core domain of p53 produce a change in the global conformation of the protein, which can be monitored by a set of anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies. More specifically, PAb1620 (human and mouse p53-specific) (23Milner J. Cook A. Sheldon M. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 453-455PubMed Google Scholar) and PAb246 (mouse p53-specific) (24Yewdell J.W. Gannon J.V. Lane D.P. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 444-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recognize the wild-type native conformation of p53, but fail to react with most mutants found in tumors. These mutants react with PAb240 (25Gannon J.V. Greaves R. Iggo R. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1595-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), which recognizes denatured, but not wild-type, p53. The definition of distinct p53 conformers is simplistic, however, since it appears that p53 is a dynamic protein, adopting different conformations in vitroand in vivo. In support of this statement, Milner and Medcalf (26Milner J. Medcalf E.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 765-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) demonstrated that formation of hetero-oligomers of wild-type and mutant p53 proteins could drive the conformation of the wild-type protein into a mutant state. Furthermore, upon binding to DNA, p53 appears to switch from a PAb1620+/PAb240− to a PAb1620−/PAb240+ conformation (27Halazonetis T.D. Davis L.J. Kandil A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Since these two conformations of p53 dictate the biological status of the protein, one could suggest that the balance between these two alternate states might determine the biological activity of p53 in cells. Identification of the mechanisms that govern this equilibrium could provide new insights into p53 structure/function. In vitro studies on purified wild-type p53 have shown that the native conformation of the protein is very temperature-sensitive. Incubation of p53 at physiological temperatures (37 °C) causes an irreversible transition from PAb1620+ to PAb1620− conformation and loss of the ability of p53 to act as a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. However, p53-interacting proteins such as human HSP70, Escherichia coli DnaK, or N-terminal antibodies (DO-1, PAb1801) can protect p53 from temperature-induced denaturation, stabilizing to a certain degree the PAb1620+ conformation of the protein (28Hansen S. Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3917-3924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Similar studies have been performed on tumor-derived p53 mutants, which appear to be even less thermostable than wild-type p53, but again, N-terminal anti-p53 antibodies can partially protect these mutants from temperature-induced unfolding (29Friedlander P. Legros Y. Soussi T. Prives C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25468-25478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently, a more quantitative approach regarding the stability of p53 has been performed using differential scanning calorimetry, where the core domains of wild-type p53 and several tumor-derived p53 mutants were subjected to urea-mediated denaturation (30Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14338-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The results of this study demonstrated that the core domain of p53 is of moderate thermodynamic stability, with all the tested mutant core domains being less stable than the wild type. All these observations provide evidence that p53 is a thermosensitive flexible protein switching between alternate conformations that can be modulated by different classes of ligands. A subset of the p53 mutations found in tumors destabilize the folded state of the protein, affecting the normal biological function of p53. To further investigate the implications of the thermosensitive phenotype of p53 regarding its biological function, we created p53 mutants able to resist temperature-dependent unfolding. For this purpose, we applied a random polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are:PCRpolymerase chain reactionELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-based mutagenesis technique called DNA shuffling (31Stemmer W.P.C. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar, 32Matsumura I. Ellington A.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 366Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and selected for p53 mutants that could resist temperature-dependent loss of PAb1620 reactivity. DNA shuffling involves random fragmentation of PCR-amplified related genes, followed by reassembly in a primerless PCR. Therefore, beneficial mutations existing in different genes can be united by homologous recombination in the same gene, mimicking the process by which proteins evolve in nature. Selected genes can then be pooled and used as a template for a new round of recombination and selection. DNA shuffling has been successfully applied for the molecular evolution of single gene products with enhanced activity (33Stemmer W.P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar), improved protein folding (34Crameri A. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Stemmer W.P.C.

Sequencing and mutational analysis of the selected mutant identified a region of 20 amino acid residues in the core domain of p53 (amino acids 101–120) that is responsible for the observed thermostable phenotype. Furthermore, the thermostable mutants can partially protect the PAb1620+ conformation of tumor-derived p53 mutants from thermal unfolding, providing a novel approach to reactivate or enhance wild-type p53 activity in tumor cells. Anti-human p53 monoclonal antibodies were used in two-site ELISA or immunoprecipitations. DO-1 interacts with amino acids 20–25 (36Stephen C.W. Helminen P. Lane D.P. J. Mol.

The product of this reaction was diluted 40-fold in a 50-μl PCR (0.2 mm each dNTP, 2.2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 units of AmpliTaq) with the inclusion ofSfiI/NotI primers at 0.2 pmol/μl, followed by a PCR program of 94 °C for 3 min and 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The correctly sized band (1.2 kilobases) was purified and digested withSfiI/NotI enzymes before being cloned into the pCANTAB5E phagemid vector. The in vitro recombined p53 library was transformed into HB2151 cells, plated on LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose, and grown overnight at 30 °C. For each round of DNA shuffling, ∼10,000 colonies transformed with the mutated p53 library were blotted on nitrocellulose filters, and protein expression was induced overnight at room temperature on LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. At this stage, the master plates were kept at 4 °C until further use. Bacterial lysis was performed by incubating the colony blot filters in PBS, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Under these lysis conditions, the PAb1620+conformation of expressed p53 was detectable. The filters were then washed twice for 15 min with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) to remove the cell debris. Subsequently, the filters were subjected to heat treatment: incubation for 15 min at 37 °C in the first round of DNA shuffling and selection and at 42 °C in the second and third rounds. After heat treatment, the filters were blocked in PBST containing 5% (w/w) Marvel (PBSTM) for 2 h and probed with PAb1620 at 2.5 μg/ml in PBSTM for 1 h before incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako D314) diluted 1:1000 in PBSTM for 1 h. Color development was performed by placing the filters in 10 ml of alkaline phosphatase buffer containing 44 μl of nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (75 mg/ml in 70% dimethylformamide) and 33 μl of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt (50 mg/ml in dimethylformamide) and incubating for 7 min. All steps were carried out at room temperature, and the filters were washed twice for 15 min with PBST between each incubation step. For the first and second rounds, the 30 colonies from the master plates corresponding to the strongest signals were selected, pooled, and used as a template for a PCR of a new cycle of recombination and selection. After the third round, the best mutant was further characterized. The mutant cDNA after the third round of selection was subcloned into the pT7-7 prokaryotic expression vector and transformed into BL21(DE3) bacteria. Protein expression and purification on a heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were performed as described (14Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), and samples were used in thermostability experiments. Equal amounts of protein were incubated at different temperatures for various periods of time. After heat treatment, the samples were transferred on ice, and serial dilutions were prepared for two-site ELISA as described below. Wild-type human p53 and p53 mutants were translated in vitro using the TnT®-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 1 μg of p53 pT7-7 plasmids was used in 50-μl reactions together with 350 μCi of [35S]methionine, and translation was performed at 30 °C for 90 min according to the manufacturer's instructions. Further protein synthesis was blocked by adding cycloheximide at 100 μg/ml, and aliquots were used in thermostability experiments as described above. After heat treatment, the samples were transferred on ice and immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of PAb1620 in 100 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA (pH 8), 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 2 h on ice. The samples were then incubated with 20 μl of protein G beads for 45 min at 4 °C and washed three times with 200 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer. The35S-labeled immunoprecipitates were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. 96-well flat-bottomed plates (Falcon 3912) were coated with 50 μl/well of purified anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies at 5 μg/ml in 0.1 mCO3/HCO3 (pH 9) at 4 °C overnight. The wells were blocked for 2 h with 200 μl of PBSTM before adding 50 μl/well of p53 samples mixed in a 1:1 ratio with PBSTM for 2 h. Detection of p53 was performed by adding 50 μl/well of anti-p53 rabbit polyclonal serum CM-1 (1:1000 in PBSTM for 1 h), followed by a 1-h incubation with 50 μl/well of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako P217; 1:1000 in PBSTM), and visualizing with 50 μl/well of TMB/H2O2 substrate (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine; Sigma T 2885). All steps were carried out at room temperature, and the plates were washed four times with 200 μl of PBST between each incubation step. For each protein concentration, duplicates were performed, and each experiment was repeated three times. S.D. values were derived from arithmetic means. Deletion mutants were created using the mutagenesis method described by Imai et al. (40Imai Y. Matsushima Y. Sugimura T. Terada M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The sequences of the mutants were confirmed by automated sequencing performed in an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer. DNA shuffling was used to randomly mutagenize the human p53 cDNA and to select for mutants that retain the wild-type native conformation at temperatures where wild-type p53 becomes unfolded. For this purpose, we used, as a screening probe, the anti-p53 monoclonal antibody PAb1620, which is specific for the wild-type folded form of p53. The mutated p53 library was transformed into bacteria, and protein expression was induced on nitrocellulose filters. After cell lysis, the filters were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the first round of mutagenesis and screening and at 42 °C in the second and third rounds, before being probed with PAb1620 for the identification of clones expressing thermostable p53. Fig.1 shows filters from all three rounds of shuffling and screening. Wild-type human p53 was used as a control in each round, and it failed to be recognized by PAb1620 after only a 15-min incubation of the filters at 37 °C, whereas there was a clear reactivity in untreated filters. After the third cycle, we isolated single clones expressing p53 detected by PAb1620 after heat treatment. The strongest positive mutant protein (TR p53) was expressed initially in bacteria and purified through a 5-ml heparin-Sepharose column as described by Hupp et al. (14Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Purified p53 mutant protein was then analyzed by two-site ELISA for epitope availability. A panel of anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies was used to capture p53, and antibody-associated p53 protein was then detected by the anti-p53 rabbit polyclonal serum CM-1 (Fig.2, A and B). The DO-1 and PAb421 monoclonal antibodies recognize linear epitopes at the N and C termini, respectively, whereas PAb240 recognizes a linear epitope in the core domain of p53 that is cryptic in the wild-type folded core of the protein, but exposed only in point-mutated or denatured p53 (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig.2 A). It appears that the isolated mutant protein displays decreased basal reactivity toward PAb1620 compared with wild-type p53, whereas it displayed very similar reactivity to all the other anti-p53 antibodies used (Fig. 2 C). We then addressed the question of the effect of temperature on epitope availability. Equal amounts of purified wild-type and TR p53 proteins were incubated at different temperatures for varying periods of time as described under “Experimental Procedures” before being serially diluted and added to ELISA wells precoated with anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, whereas there was no effect of temperature on the epitopes recognized by DO-1 and PAb421 (Fig. 3,A and B) for either wild-type p53 or the TR mutant, we observed profound differences in the reactivity toward the conformation-dependent antibodies, PAb1620 and PAb240 (Fig.3, C and D). Heat treatment resulted in the gradual loss of PAb1620 recognition of wild-type p53, consistent with previous reports demonstrating that p53 is a thermosensitive protein (28Hansen S. Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3917-3924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The TR mutant, however, displayed a different phenotype; temperature stress resulted in a reproducible 30–40% increase in PAb1620 reactivity, with a concurrent 30% decrease in the PAb240 epitope availability. Maximum resistance to temperature-dependent unfolding was achieved at 42 °C since further increase in temperature up to 60 °C resulted in a progressive loss of the PAb1620-reactive epitope (data not shown).Figure 3Effect of temperature on epitope availability for the TR mutant and wild-type p53. A two-site ELISA was used to monitor the effect of temperature on linear (A andB) and conformational (C and D) epitopes of the TR mutant and wild-type human p53. Equal amounts of protein (200 ng) were incubated at different temperatures for varying periods of time. The samples were cooled on ice, and serial dilutions were prepared and added to ELISA wells precoated with anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies. As before, detection of p53-antibody interaction was performed with the anti-p53 polyclonal antibody CM-1. Shown are the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments (two wells/condition). ■, 4 °C; ⋄, 37 °C for 20 min; ○, 37 °C for 45 min; ▵, 42 °C for 45 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then used thein vitro transcription/translation reticulocyte lysate system to investigate the thermostability of the isolated mutant in an alternative eukaryotic expression system. Wild-type human p53 and the TR mutant were expressed as described under “Experimental Procedures” at 30 °C for 90 min, and further transcription was inhibited by addition of cycloheximide. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to thermal treatment as described above and then immunoprecipitated with PAb1620. Fig.4 A shows that the amount of wild-type p53 recognized by PAb1620 progressively decreased after heat treatment, whereas an increasing amount of TR mutant p53 was immunoprecipitated by PAb1620, consistent with the thermostable phenotype observed using bacterially expressed protein in the ELISA. Reticulocyte lysates have recently been shown to contain Mdm2-like proteins, present in p53·DNA complexes (41Hall A.R. Milner J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mdm2-p53 interaction appears to be crucial for the stability of p53 in cells since Mdm2 can target p53 for rapid degradation (42Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3722) Google Scholar, 43Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar, 44Bottger A. Bottger V. Sparks A. Liu W.L. Howard S.F. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 860-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). We were interested to see whether there was p53 proteolysis in our heat treatment experiments, which could lead to decreased protein levels. Fig. 4 B shows that heat treatment did not affect the overall protein levels of either wild-type or TR mutant p53. Therefore, the temperature-induced decrease in PAb1620 reactivity of wild-type p53 must be due to conformational changes and loss of native structure, which were resisted by TR mutant p53. The biochemical behavior of the thermostable mutant was consistent in both expression systems, i.e. decreased PAb1620 reactivity that is resistant to heat treatment. An interesting observation that arose from these experiments is that the isolated thermostable mutant has a much faster rate of migration compared with wild-type p53 on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4, A and B). The explanation for this phenomenon lies in the sequence of the TR mutant described below. Sequencing of the isolated TR mutant after the third cycle revealed 14 point mutations throughout the p53 cDNA sequence resulting in 12 amino acid substitutions. Interestingly, there were also three nucleotide deletions at positions 179, 196, and 359 of the p53 cDNA sequence. During translation of the TR mutant, the coding sequence is out of frame after the first two deletions, but is back in frame after the third deletion. Therefore, the amino acid sequence from positions 60 to 120 has been replaced by a non-p53 peptide encoded by an alternative reading frame. The mutant is therefore one amino acid residue smaller than wild-type p53, which nevertheless creates a dramatic change in the migration on SDS-PAGE. We carried out mutational analysis to identify the region in the TR mutant responsible for the observed phenotype. For this purpose, we recombined different parts of the mutant cDNA onto a wild-type background. Fig. 5 shows the derived mutants and their phenotype, designated either as + or − depending on whether they behave as the thermostable TR mutant (+) or as wild-type thermosensitive p53 (−). The classifying criterion was resistance to temperature-dependent loss of PAb1620 reactivity. It appears that the region between amino acids 60 and 120 is responsible for the thermostable phenotype (mutant 6AB/3). We then created deletions in this region, which demonstrated that deletion of 20 amino acid residues (positions 101–120) in the core of p53 (mutant 6b) was necessary and sufficient for the original thermostable phenotype we observed. This phenomenon is specific for this particular region of p53 since deletion of 20 amino acid residues at the C-terminal end of the core domain of p53 (amino acids 281–300) created a mutant with wild-type thermosensitive properties (mutant 8b). It has been previously shown that N-terminal anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies can protect wild-type p53 from temperature-dependent unfolding (28Hansen S. Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3917-3924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Friedlander P. Legros Y. Soussi T. Prives C. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2007411488,"A combination of hydrodynamic and cross-linking studies were used to investigate self-assembly of the Escherichia coli DNA repair protein UvrB. Though the procession of steps leading to incision of DNA at sites flanking damage requires that UvrB engage in an ordered series of complexes, successively with UvrA, DNA, and UvrC, the potential for self-association had not yet been reported. Gel permeation chromatography, nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and chemical cross-linking results combine to show that UvrB stably assembles as a dimer in solution at concentrations in the low micromolar range. Smaller populations of higher order oligomeric species are also observed. Unlike the dimerization of UvrA, an initial step promoted by ATP binding, the monomer-dimer equilibrium for UvrB is unaffected by the presence of ATP. The insensitivity of cross-linking efficiency to a 10-fold variation in salt concentration further suggests that UvrB self-assembly is driven largely by hydrophobic interactions. Self-assembly is significantly weakened by proteolytic removal of the carboxyl terminus of the protein (generating UvrB*), a domain also known to be required for the interaction with UvrC leading to the initial incision of damaged DNA. This suggests that the C terminus may be a multifunctional binding domain, with specificity regulated by protein conformation.

In the characterization of any protein, fundamental questions include whether the monomeric structure is complete, and the identity of other macromolecules with which it can functionally interact. The answers to these take on added importance for the components of the nucleotide excision repair pathway (NER) 1The abbreviations used are:NERnucleotide excision repairPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisDTTdithiothreitolMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidMe2SOdimethyl sulfoxideDMSdimethylsuberimidateDSGdisuccinimidyl glutarate in Escherichia coli. Introduction of dual incisions surrounding a damage site in DNA by the NER proteins UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC, requires an ordered succession of association/dissociation steps, mediated at multiple points along the pathway by nucleotide binding and/or catalysis. As detailed in recent reviews (1Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), the following sequence of steps have been suggested, focusing here on the shifting identity and stoichiometry of the macromolecular components of the repair complex. nucleotide excision repair polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis dithiothreitol 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid dimethyl sulfoxide dimethylsuberimidate disuccinimidyl glutarate Dimerization of the UvrA protein, promoted by ATP binding, enables formation of a protein-DNA complex, initially at an undamaged site (4Oh E.Y. Claassen L. Thiagalingam S. Mazur S. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4145-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,5Mazur S.J. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recruitment of UvrB, which does not on its own bind DNA, generates a functional UvrA2-UvrB1-DNA complex, with this stoichiometry assumed from that demonstrated for an ATP-dependent UvrA-UvrB interaction (DNA not present) in solution (6Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). At this stage, the repair proteins can disengage from the initial DNA binding site, allowing translocation or delivery to the DNA lesion (7Seeley T.W. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7158-7165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Damage recognition is marked by formation of a stable protein-DNA complex (8Yeung A.T. Mattes W.B. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2567-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), from which UvrA dissociates (6Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6736-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leaving a UvrB-DNA pre-incision complex. The DNA in this complex is acutely kinked (11Shi Q. Thresher R. Sancar A. Griffith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), a structural change necessary for later incision and either facilitated by or stabilized by contacts with UvrB (12Hsu D.S. Kim S.-T. Sun Q. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8319-8327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is likely that conformational change(s) also occur in the UvrB protein to augment its affinity for DNA; in solution, nucleotide binding by UvrB has been shown to be limited to short oligonucleotides bearing damage (12Hsu D.S. Kim S.-T. Sun Q. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8319-8327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Addition of UvrC is enabled by conformational changes in the UvrB-damaged DNA pre-incision complex (13Delagoutte E. Bertrand-Burggraf E. Dunand J. Fuchs R.P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and prompts a further conformational change that is dependent in rate on the nature of damage (14Visse R. van Gool A.J. Moolenaar G.F. de Ruijter M. van de Putte P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1804-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These steps complete the endonucleolytic-competent complex that finally cleaves the DNA backbone in the hallmark pattern of NER, first four to five residues 3′, and then eight phosphodiester bonds 5′ to the lesion (15Sancar A. Rupp W.D. Cell. 1983; 33: 249-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 16Yeung A.T. Mattes W.B. Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13582-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As noted with DNA, UvrB has no or an extremely weak affinity for UvrC when the two are simply introduced in solution. The addition of UvrC to the repair complex is dependent both on the presence of the C-terminal domain of UvrB, and a conformational change that apparently renders this interaction surface accessible (20Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D.M. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30508-30515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As a nexus in the progression of pre-incision steps, the malleable UvrB is thus called upon to display, at the appropriate times, binding affinities that are masked in the isolated protein. The catalytic properties of UvrB, as well as its associative properties, are markedly altered along the repair pathway. In particular, expression of the DNA-dependent ATPase of UvrB, an activity that is cryptic in the isolated protein, has been shown to be essential for release of the A2-B-DNA from the initial binding site (7Seeley T.W. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7158-7165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in formation of the pre-incision complex (21Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. Ortiz-Buysse M. Goosen N. van de Putte P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), in supporting the 5′ incision by the UvrB-UvrC nuclease (22Zou Y. Walker R. Bassett H. Geacintov N.E. van Houten B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4820-4827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and likely in the translocation of the repair proteins to the damage site (evidence reviewed in Ref. 1Grossman L. Thiagalingam S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16871-16874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known in detail of the manifold protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions at any given point along the pathway and less of the regulation of transitions between associations, structurally or kinetically. Whether step-specific changes in stoichiometry may occur, as has been demonstrated qualitatively for subunit composition (e.g. dissociation of UvrA before recruitment of UvrC), has not yet been addressed. A more complete understanding of the potential for interactions of any of the repair proteins could only aid in our understanding of this complex mechanism by which damage of a remarkably broad spectrum is recognized and removed. In our purification of UvrB, we observed that its elution volume from a gel exclusion column, compared with that of protein standards, suggested a hydrodynamic volume approximately twice that predicted from the molecular weight of UvrB. This led us to broaden the scope of an earlier hydrodynamic study so as to re-examine the generality of the reported finding (6Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) that UvrB exists solely as a monomer, and whether one may then infer that UvrB-UvrB subunit interactions could play no role in complex assembly. We present evidence here, derived from both hydrodynamic and chemical cross-linking techniques, that self-association, the formation of dimers and possibly higher order oligomers, is within the panoply of UvrB interactions and is likely to occur under physiological conditions. We also show that truncation of the protein by theompT protease, which yields a product termed UvrB*, significantly impairs self-association. UvrB* is of interest in (at least) two ways. The residues eliminated are at the C terminus, and have been shown to be required for recruitment of UvrC to the incision complex (20Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D.M. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30508-30515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and because the cryptic DNA-dependent ATPase of UvrB is active in UvrB*, offering the possibility that it may serve as a model for conformational changes induced normally by interaction with UvrA. The source, purification, and quantitation of UvrB protein have recently been described in detail (23Hildebrand E.L. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7818-7827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, theuvrB gene, under the regulation of its own promoters, was originally cloned into a pTZ19R plasmid from the E. colistrain AB1157 and expressed in N364 (W3110 gal+, sup0, F−, Δ(attB-bio-uvrB)), auvrB deletion strain of E. coli K-12 (obtained from M. Gottesman, Columbia University). Specific proteolysis of the UvrB proteins, using the ompT expression system UT5600/pmL19 (24Grodberg J. Dunn J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), and purification of the UvrB* product also followed published protocol (7Seeley T.W. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7158-7165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrodynamic radius and by implication the assembly state of UvrB and its potential dependence on initial protein concentration was examined using a 1.0 × 30 cm (10/30) Superose 12 HR column, operated at room temperature (22–24 °C) by a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The buffer used with this column was 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 2 mm DTT. Glycerol content of the buffer had been reduced to keep operating pressure lower; this ranged from approximately 0.75–1.0 megapascals during sample and standard runs at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Sample was loaded in a volume of 0.1 ml, and elution from the column was monitored by flow-through absorbance measurements at 280 nm, with 0.3 ml fractions collected as a check on elution volume and protein integrity (as judged by SDS-PAGE). Calibration standards were purchased from Sigma (MW-GF-200 kit, supplemented with apoferritin and thyroglobulin to extend the molecular weight range to 669,000), and included blue dextran (M r 2,000,000) for void volume determination. The partition coefficient,K av = (V e −V 0)/(V t −V 0), where V e is the elution volume, V 0, the void volume, andV t, the total gel volume, was calculated for standards and samples from triplicate runs (25Laurent T.C. Killander J. J. Chromatogr. 1964; 14: 317-330Crossref Google Scholar, 26Ackers G.K. Neurath H. Hill R.L. The Proteins. 1. Academic Press, New York1975: 1-94Crossref Google Scholar). The Stokes radii values for standards were taken from the literature (27Potschka M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), except for β-amylase, for which a value of 5.18 nm was calculated from the published sedimentation coefficient and ancillary data (28Spradlin J. Thoma J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 117-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligomers of UvrB were resolved on a 4–30% polyacrylamide gradient gel (375 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.8); a 3% stacking gel (125 mm Tris·Cl, pH 6.8) was used to further improve resolution. The denaturant SDS was omitted from the gels and from both electrophoresis (25 mm Tris·Cl, 250 mm glycine, pH 8.3) and sample buffers (which contained a final concentration of 10% glycerol and 0.05% bromphenol blue). Electrophoresis was performed at 100 V to 2,000 V-h at room temperature, or at 150 V to 3,000 V-h at 4 °C. Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 staining. Molecular weight standards were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (HMW kit). The bifunctional imidoester dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) (29Davies G.E. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) is reactive primarily with lysine residues, and has long been used as a protein cross-linking reagent (30Peters K. Richards F.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 523-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). UvrB and UvrB* proteins, at 5 μm, were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min at room temperature in a buffer of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT and KCl at 25, 100, or 300 mm, and ± ATP to 8 mm, before addition of cross-linker, bringing the reaction volume to 20 μl. DMS (Fluka BioChemika) was then added to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml from a freshly prepared 25 mg/ml stock solution in 0.5 mtriethanolamine buffer, pH 8.5 (31Chao K. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1165-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). An additional 1-μl aliquot of the DMS stock (an increment of 1.2 mg/ml) was added after 15 min of incubation, owing to the short lifetime of this reagent in aqueous solution. After 30 min, the reaction was quenched with Tris (pH 6.8), to a final concentration of 50 mm. Products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 staining. Trials were also performed with glutaraldehyde (Sigma) and disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG), obtained from Pierce. The latter is a homobifunctional reagent of the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester family that also targets primary amino groups (32Ji T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 580-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). With these reagents, the protocol above was used with the following exceptions: glutaraldehyde was added as an aqueous solution to a final concentration of 0.1%; and DSG to 500 μm, from a freshly prepared 10 mm stock in Me2SO (Me2SO contributed no more than 5% of the total reaction volume of 20 μl). Gel filtration chromatography is used in our laboratory in the purification of UvrB. This is performed at 4 °C using a 4.9 × 110-cm column of Sephacryl S-300, equilibrated with 50 mm potassium MOPS, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol. Molecular weight standards were run through this column, in duplicate, as a routine performance evaluation. Comparison of the single elution peak of UvrB from two purification runs with a calibration plot of the partition coefficients determined for the molecular weight standards yielded a predicted Stokes radius of 4.55 nm, and an apparent molecular weight estimate of 150,000. This suggested that, under the conditions described, UvrB occurred predominantly as a dimer (if roughly globular, as would be expected for the standards). More rigorous gel filtration studies were performed with a 1.0 × 30-cm Superose 12 fast protein liquid chromatography column at room temperature in a buffer of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 2 mm DTT. The performance of this column can be judged from the calibration curve shown in Fig.1 a, in which the log of the Stokes radius for standards ranging in molecular weight from 12,400 to 669,000 is plotted versus the observed partition coefficientK av (error estimates for the mean partition coefficients for standards and protein samples expressed as the coefficient of variation ranged from 0.21 to 1.94%; the regression correlation coefficient, R2, for the calibration curve was 0.979). Loaded onto this column at initial concentrations ranging from 1 to 35 μm (1 μm being the lower limit for a significant signal with our apparatus), UvrB eluted consistently as a single peak with minor tailing but with the peak position showing a strong concentration dependence. The effective radii of hydration (Stokes radius) for UvrB at the differing initial concentrations were calculated from the calibration curve shown and are plotted in Fig.1 b. At the lowest concentration, 1 μm, the partition coefficient coincided with a Stokes radius of 3.7 nm or an apparent molecular weight of 97,000 (estimated from an alternate calibration curve plotting K av versus M r). At an initial concentration of approximately 24 μm, the partition coefficient approached an asymptotic value corresponding to a Stokes radius of 4.67 nm or apparent molecular weight of 170,000. These results are indicative of associative behavior and suggest a monomer-dimer equilibrium (molecular weights predicted from the amino acid composition are 76,091 and 152,182, respectively). The single peak observed at any given concentration further suggests that equilibration is rapid with respect to the limits imposed by the elution experiment. The higher values for molecular weights obtained by gel filtration, compared with those predicted by sequence, could derive from a number of factors. The lower molecular weight predicted represents, of course, a limit of detection imposed by our experimental conditions; a lower plateau was not demonstrated but would presumably be intermediate between that observed and the value estimated for UvrB* (below). Partitioning in gel permeation, furthermore, is a function of molecular shape as well as size (27Potschka M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), hence deviation from the globular shape of the commonly used standards could lead to error. Interaction of protein with the gel matrix cannot be excluded, though the salt concentration used (300 mm) should minimize this possibility. Finally, the observed partition coefficient represents a mass averaged function of the species in equilibrium. A minor population of higher order oligomers could skew the partition function toward values suggesting a higher molecular weight. In contrast to UvrB, the elution behavior of UvrB* provides no indication of a potential for oligomeric self-association. Over a range in initial concentration from 1 to 30 μm, the partition coefficient corresponds to a Stokes radius of 3.4 nm, or apparent molecular weight of 77,000. Depending on which cleavage site is recognized by the ompT protease (20Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D.M. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30508-30515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 33Arikan E. Kulkarni M.S. Thomas D.C. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2637-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the molecular weight predicted from sequence for a monomer of UvrB* would be in the range of 68,588 to 71,080. A single elution peak was also observed for UvrB*, except at the highest concentration, where a minor peak coincided with the column void volume. It is likely that this material resulted from a large-scale aggregation of UvrB*. Such aggregates would have a Stokes radius in excess of that of the largest protein standard used, M r 670,000, and would likely include ten subunits as a minimum. The propensity of UvrB* to form large aggregates in concentrated solution had been surmised from its excessive but variable ability to scatter light, as observed (data not shown) both in absorbance and fluorescence emission spectra (Rayleight scatter peaks). A tendency to form such aggregates has been reported both for UvrA and UvrC (6Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 34Yeung A.T. Mattes W.B. Oh E.Y. Yoakum G.H. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8535-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis through a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel offers a relatively rapid yet sensitive technique for examination of the potential for self-assembly by a protein. Multiple bands can be resolved when UvrB is electrophoresed on such gels, the most useful to date being a 4–30% gradient gel, as shown in Fig. 2. Run at room temperature, five bands can be discerned (and corroborated by densitometric profiles, not shown) when 15 μg of UvrB is applied (lane 2). Three bands remain detectable by Coomassie staining with the protein load reduced to 5 μg (gel not shown). An equal loading (i.e. 15 μg) of this protein on SDS gels gives a single band when visualized by Coomassie staining, with an estimate of 98–99% purity from densitometer scans (cross-linking gels to be shown below). That the state of assembly is temperature-dependent is evident by comparison with the migration profiles seen in Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6. With electrophoresis performed at 4 °C rather than at room temperature, the number of visible UvrB bands (lane 5) is apparently reduced (three are detectable; that of highest molecular weight marginal by eye but detectable by densitometry), the distribution is altered to more strongly favor the band with greatest mobility (68% of lane density, as compared with 36% at 22 °C), and the mobility of this major band is shifted relative to that of the molecular weight standards (toward an apparently higher molecular weight). It is our suggestion that this most mobile band of UvrB is not populated by monomeric UvrB, but by monomer and dimer in rapid equilibrium and with the equilibrium position altered by temperature. If so, the additional bands may represent oligomers with from three to six subunits. Assignment of the degree of oligomerization to bands is not straightforward. The mobility of a given band in a nondenaturing gel depends on molecular charge as well as size and shape. By use of a gradient gel with up to 30% polyacrylamide, protein standards in a size range appropriate to the study of UvrB oligomerization will, if driven long enough by an applied voltage, reach a pore size small enough to block further migration. If electrophoresis is continued until all proteins, even those with low charge density, reach their terminal postions, then comparison of sample mobility with that of standards has merit (35Margolis J. Wrigley C.W. J. Chromatogr. 1975; 106: 204-209Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The use of standards, however, to estimate the molecular weight of a sample is subject to uncertainty unless it is known that the relation of both size and shape to molecular weight is invariant between sample and standards (36Felgenhauer K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1974; 355: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Given this caveat, the estimated apparent molecular weights for the UvrB bands marked by arrows in Fig. 2, lane 2 (22 °C) are: 106,800 ± 4,100, 201,200 ± 11,900, 263,700 ± 10,800, 318,600 ± 9,100, and 394,800 ± 6,700. On their own, and not unexpectedly, these estimates do not permit unambiguous assignment of the bands. The estimate for the smallest UvrB species is intermediate between that of a monomer (76,091) and of a dimer (152,182). When run at 4 °C, this band migrates with an apparent molecular weight closer to that expected for the dimer, 145,400 ± 6,600. In gradient gels, the leading edge of the band, where molecules would encounter smaller pore sizes, is usually sharpened. The broadness of the major UvrB bands, at either temperature, and the diffuse appearance of the leading edge, in addition to the temperature dependence support the suggestion that these bands may represent a weight-averaged migration position of monomer and dimer in rapid equilibrium. This interpretation gains support from the single elution peak noted in the gel filtration studies with UvrB. If so, the slower migrating bands could be assigned to tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexamers; with these assignments the estimates of apparent molecular weight would underestimate the values calculated from the amino acid composition by 12–16%. With proteolytic truncation of the C terminus, the potential for self-association of UvrB is significantly reduced, yet potential oligomer bands can be seen when 15 μg of UvrB* is electrophoresed in native gels (Fig. 2, lanes 3and 6). The major band has an estimated molecular weight of 70,500 ± 2,200 (22 °C run, lane 3) to 73,700 ± 1,500 (4 °C run, lane 6). This is close to that predicted for a monomer from the amino acid composition, approximately 68,500–71,080, depending, as noted above, on the site of cleavage. Cleavage at more than one site may in fact account for the additional bands not marked by arrows flanking the major UvrB* band, although contaminants derived from the exposure to ompT-expressing cells cannot be ruled out. The major band itself, on close examination, appears to be a doublet. Conceivably, this may result from near equal cleavage rates at either lysine 605 or 607, generating products differing in molecular mass by 230 Da, as recently suggested (20Moolenaar G.F. Franken K.L.M.C. Dijkstra D.M. Thomas-Oates J.E. Visse R. van de Putte P. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30508-30515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The mobility of the putative oligomers of UvrB*, denoted also by open arrowheads, were used to estimate molecular weights ranging from 113,000 ± 6,500 (4 °C gel) to 138,100 ± 10,200 (22 °C), a potential dimer, and from 172,400 ± 11,000 (22 °C) to 216,000 ± 9,200 (4 °C), a potential trimer. The potential for self-association of UvrB and UvrB* was further examined with a nonhydrodynamic approach, chemical cross-linking. The purity of the UvrB protein used in experiments was estimated to be 98–99%, as judged by densitometer scans (Fig. 3, lane 2 and from replicate experiments). Covalently linked oligomers of UvrB, resolved by SDS-PAGE, were readily obtained with the lysine-reactive bifunctional reagents glutaraldehyde, DSG, and DMS. Results with DMS are shown in Fig. 3. With exposure of 5 μm UvrB for 30 min to 5 mg/ml of DMS, cross-linked products included apparent dimers (migration position marked by the solid arrow) and higher order oligomers. Though UvrB is a cryptic DNA-dependent ATPase, we recently demonstrated that it binds ATP, with an apparentK D ∼ 1 mm (23Hildebrand E.L. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7818-7827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cross-linking efficiency was not, however, significantly altered by the addition of Mg-ATP to 8 mm. Variation in the potassium chloride concentration, from 25 to 300 mm, also was without effect on the yield of dimers or total cross-linked species, suggesting that the self-association of UvrB is largely hydrophobic in character. We do note for future study, though, that the distribution of the higher order oligomers may be dependent on salt concentration. As the KCl concentration is increased"

In this study, using the rat hybrid small intestinal epithelial cell line, hBRIE 380i cells, we demonstrated that PYY- and NPY-induced rearrangement of actin filaments may be in part through a Y1α and/or a nonneuronal Y2 receptor, which were cloned from both the intestinal mucosa and the hBRIE 380i cells. A number of PYY/NPY-responsive genes were also identified by subtractive hybridization of the hBRIE 380i cells in the presence or absence of a 6-h treatment with PYY. Several of these genes coded for proteins associated with the cell cytoskeleton or extracellular matrix. One of these proteins was the transmembrane-4 superfamily protein CD63, previously shown to associate with β1-integrin and implicated in cell adhesion. CD63 immunoreactivity, using antibody to the extracellular domain, was highest in the differentiated cell clusters of the hBRIE 380i cells. The hBRIE 380i cells transfected with antisense CD63 cDNA lost these differentiated clusters. These studies suggest a new role for NPY and PYY in modulating differentiation through cytoskeletal associated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2029643801,"Abstract Allantoin pathway gene expression inSaccharomyces cerevisiae responds to two different environmental stimuli. The expression of these genes is induced in the presence of allantoin or its degradative metabolites and repressed when a good nitrogen source (e.g. asparagine or glutamine) is provided. Three types of cis-acting sites and trans-acting factors are required for allantoin pathway gene transcription as follows: (i)UAS NTR element associated with the transcriptional activators Gln3p and Gat1p, (ii)URS GATA element associated with the repressor Dal80p, and (iii) UIS ALL element associated with the Dal82 and Dal81 proteins required for inducer-dependent transcription. Most of the work leading to the above conclusions has employed inducer-independent allantoin pathway genes (e.g. DAL5 and DAL3). The purpose of this work is to extend our understanding of these elements and their roles to inducible allantoin pathway genes using theDAL7 (encoding malate synthase) as a model. We show that eight distinct cis-acting sites participate in the process as follows: a newly identified GC-rich element, two UAS NTR, two UIS ALL, and threeURS GATA elements. The two GATA-containingUAS NTR elements are coincident with two of the three GATA sequences that make up the URS GATAelements. The remaining URS GATA GATA sequence, however, is not a UAS NTR element but appears to function only in repression. The data provide insights into how these cis- and trans-acting factors function together to accomplish the regulated expression of the DAL7 gene that is observedin vivo."

Each subunit within the dodecamer contains an N-terminal helix, residues 1–14, with the helical axes approximately perpendicular to the six-fold symmetry axis that runs through the center of the ring structure (Fig. 1 C). When two GS molecules are docked, helices are contributed from each dodecamer, forming six interdodecameric “helix-dimers.” Within the helices, His-4, Met-8, and His-12 provide potential ligands to metal ions that “bridge” these helix-dimers. On the basis of the previous characterization and model peptides with the sequence of the N-terminal helices (15Schurke P. Jochheim C.M. Dabrowski M.J. Atkins W.M. (1999) Proceedings of the 34th Hanford Symposium on Health and the Environment: From 3D Structure to Application. October 23–26, 1996Google Scholar), a model (Fig. 1 D) that is consistent with the available data suggests that each of the six interdodecameric helix-dimer interactions provides a binuclear metal site, in which one metal ion will bind in a linear bidentate mode between the two His-4 side chains, and the second metal in a similar geometry between the two His-12 side chains. Thus, at each GS-GS interface, 12 metal ions are shared. In addition, the Met-8 side chains may provide ligands to either or both metals. This is based on the observation that the M8L mutant stacks poorly with all metal ions, whereas the M8C mutant stacks efficiently with some metals and poorly with others (13Dabrowski M.J. Yanchunas J. Cader-Villafranca B.M. Dietze E.C. Schurke P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14957-14964Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, experimental approaches required to challenge this model have been inapplicable or unsuccessful. An inherent problem with site-directed mutagenesis, when not coupled to other experimental approaches, is the possibility that mutations that are remote from the amino acid substitution cause structural changes, which indirectly alter the function of interest. Therefore, the effects of mutation at His-4, Met-8, or His-12 provide only indirect evidence for their roles in the GS-GS stacking reaction. Optical spectroscopy of the metal centers and magnetic relaxation techniques relying on nuclei in the self-assembled GS tubes are hampered by the size and insolubility of these complexes. Thus, direct evidence for the nature of the protein ligands to the metals and the stoichiometry of the metal binding sites has been elusive. In fact, no high resolution structural data for any GS dodecamer-dodecamer complex have been reported. In contrast to optical techniques and protein-based nuclear relaxation methods, EPR provides a direct probe of metal environment that is not dependent on aqueous solubility or isotropic character of the supramolecular aggregate. Cu2+ was previously demonstrated to be an efficient ion for directing the stacking reaction (8Yanchunas Jr., J. Dabrowski M.J. Schurke P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14949-14956Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but the spectroscopic properties of this metal bound at the GS-GS interface have not been exploited. Here, we employ Cu2+ EPR as a probe of metal environment and binding stoichiometry of the intermolecular binding sites that mediate GS stacking. The results provide direct structural evidence in support of the binuclear nature of the interhelical sites and provide significant refinement of the previous model for dodecamer-dodecamer interactions of E. coli GS. Site-directed mutagenesis and protein purification were as described previously (13Dabrowski M.J. Yanchunas J. Cader-Villafranca B.M. Dietze E.C. Schurke P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14957-14964Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), with the following modifications: ZnSO4 precipitation, acetone precipitation, and (NH4)2SO4/acid precipitation steps were omitted. Instead, after treatment with streptomycin sulfate, the cellular lysate was chromatographed over Blue Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted with 40 ml of 20 mm ADP. The fractions were assayed by the γ-glutamyl transferase assay and those which showed greatest activity were pooled, concentrated, and poured over a G-25 gel-filtration column (Sigma). The eluent was assayed for activity by the γ-glutamyl transferase assay, and fractions that showed the greatest activity were pooled. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE to be >95%. Because GS is a metalloenzyme, the possibility exists that adventitious Cu2+ could bind in the active site, displacing the ions which are normally found there, and interfering with the titration of the N-terminal binding sites. In order to minimize this possible interference, Mg+2 ions were bound into the active site using the pseudo-irreversible inhibitorl-methionine sulfoximine (MSOX), as described previously (5Maurizi M.R. Kasprzyk P.G. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 16Hunt J.B. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 590-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Maurizi M.R. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4271-4278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stocks of 100 mm MSOX and 100 mmMg+2-ATP (both acquired from Sigma) were prepared in deionized water. Purified GS was dialyzed against four 1-liter changes of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm EDTA to remove Mn+2 from the active site, replacing it with Mg+2. This was followed by four 1-liter changes of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 100 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. Protein solution containing >10 mg of GS was concentrated to 4.5 ml total volume, after which 250 μl of MSOX and 250 μl of Mg+2-ATP were added and the solution incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the protein solution was dialyzed against four 1-liter changes of buffer containing 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.2), 100 mm KCl, and 10 mmMgCl2. The MSOX inactivated GS solution was concentrated to 5.25 mg/ml protein, or approximately 103 μm subunits (determined spectroscopically). Individual stocks of Cu2+(CH3COO−)2, ranging from 0 to 5 mm Cu2+ in 250 or 500 μmincrements, were prepared from a central stock of 0.1 mcupric acetate. Aliquots of 6 μl of each Cu2+ stock were added to 144 μl of GS protein, bringing the total volume to 150 μl and the protein concentration to 5.1 mg/ml, or approximately 100 μm subunits. This resulted in a titration range from 0 to 200 μm Cu2+, or 0–2.0 eq of Cu2+with respect to protein concentration. The samples were then placed in EPR sample tubes and stored in the refrigerator at 4 °C overnight. EPR spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker EMX X-band spectrometer. The following parameters were utilized for all spectroscopy: the frequency was 9.41 GHz, the power was 63.31 milliwatts, the modulation frequency was 100 kHz, the modulation amplitude was 10 Gauss, the time constant was 40.96 ms, and the conversion time was 163.84 ms. All spectra were recorded at 153 K, using liquid nitrogen as coolant. We have suggested previously, based on turbidity measurements, that Cu2+ induces GS dodecamers to self-assemble into extended tubes (8Yanchunas Jr., J. Dabrowski M.J. Schurke P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14949-14956Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Dabrowski M.J. Yanchunas J. Cader-Villafranca B.M. Dietze E.C. Schurke P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14957-14964Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The self-assembly process was monitored by light scattering and transmission EM. Shown here are representative transmission EM micrographs of the wild type GS in the presence and absence of 20 μm Cu2+ (Fig.2). The EM micrographs clearly demonstrate the Cu2+-dependent formation of GS tubes under conditions similar to those used for the EPR experiments. The EM experiments were performed at a 50-fold dilution with respect to GS concentration. The higher protein concentration is required for the EPR experiments, but this concentration affords undecipherable EM images due to side-to-side aggregation of tubes. We assume that these side-to-side interactions do not interfere with the EPR signals characterized here. This assumption is supported by the data presented below. 100 μm wild type GS was titrated with 0–2.0 eq of Cu2+, with respect to protein concentration, in incremental steps of 0.2 eq. This titration serves as a base line for the study of the various site-directed mutations to this metal binding site. The spectra of wild type GS (Fig. 3) is consistent with classically observed powder spectra of nitrogen-bound Cu2+ ions. The g∥, A∥, and g⊥ values observed are consistent with those observed for histidine- or imidazole-ligated Cu2+ EPR standards (18Knowles P.F. Marsh D. Rattle H.W.E. Magnetic Resonance of Biomolecules. John Wiley & Sons, New York1976Google Scholar, 19Vanngard T. Swartz H.M. Bolton J.R. Borg D.C. Biological Applications of Electron Spin Resonance.

Plenum Press, New York1978: 277-342Google Scholar). A small contribution from another species of Cu2+results in a perturbation of the spectrum, which is detectable at low equivalencies of Cu2+ but is obscured by the Cu2+-protein signal as the Cu2+ concentration increases. Comparison to a reference spectrum of 100 μmCu2+ in 50 mm HEPES (data not shown) indicated buffer-ligated Cu2+ to be the most likely source of this minor interference. Previously, it was suggested that Met-8 may play a role in the stabilization of these two sites (13Dabrowski M.J. Yanchunas J. Cader-Villafranca B.M. Dietze E.C. Schurke P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14957-14964Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In an effort to elucidate the contribution from this residue, the M8C and M8L mutants were studied by EPR. In principle, the M8C mutation places a strong ligand in the vicinity of each of the proposed metal binding sites, and relieves some steric crowding. However, the much shorter cysteine side chain may not reach either Cu2+ center. The M8L mutation removes the potential sulfur ligand from the vicinity of the two sites, and also adds steric bulk, which may perturb the geometry or solvation of either metal center. As mentioned previously, the M8C mutant was observed to stack more efficiently than wild type with some metals and less well with others, while the M8L mutant stacked less well than wild type regardless of the metal. In all cases, the M8C mutant was observed to stack with a larger apparent rate constant than the M8L mutant under similar reaction conditions. Interestingly, the g∥, A∥, and g⊥ parameters observed for the two mutants were virtually identical, both to each other and to those observed for wild type GS (Table I). The most significant change observed was the marked difference in the lineshapes of the two mutants when compared with each other and to wild type. The small perturbation observed in the spectrum of wild type GS is greatly exaggerated in the M8L mutant (Fig.4, top), and completely absent in the M8C mutant (Fig. 4, bottom). As a result of the variance in Cu2+ buffer contribution, the linewidths of the spectra from the three proteins also show a trend, beginning with the narrow M8C spectra and widening as more contribution from buffer is observed in the wild type and M8L spectra.Table ISpectral parameters for Cu2+ binding to wild type and mutant GSProteing ⊥g ∥A ∥Linewidth× 10−3 cm−1GaussWild type2.062.2419.3123.2M8C2.062.2519.3110.6M8L2.062.2419.1138.8H4A2.062.2419.3114.9H4C12-site2.062.2319.3135.94-site2.062.2817.179.2H12C12-site2.062.2816.288.04-site2.062.2418.2129.0 Open table in a new tab In addition to studies in which we replaced individual metal ligands with other ligand types, we have also studied an H4A mutant (data not shown), in which the putative 4-site has been abolished. Similar to wild type, a spectral signal arising from buffer-bound Cu2+is observed at low concentrations of metal, but the spectrum of protein-bound copper is readily observed at higher concentrations. The Cu2+ EPR spectra of the H4A mutant was nearly identical to those of the wild type enzyme, with the exception that the spectrum at 0.6 eq of Cu2+/subunit of H4A GS is less intense than that observed for the wild type, indicating that less copper is bound. Presumably, this reflects cooperativity of binding the two metal ions when both His-4 and His-12 are present. For reasons which are not clear, an analogous mutant H12L, intended to completely remove the ligand at position 12, was expressed poorly. Therefore, we were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of this mutant to perform EPR. However, other substitutions at position 4 and 12 were characterized. H4C and H12C mutants were studied in order to determine whether His-4 and His-12 are ligands to the Cu2+ centers observed in the Cu2+-GS spectrum, as proposed on the basis of previous work (8Yanchunas Jr., J. Dabrowski M.J. Schurke P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14949-14956Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Dabrowski M.J. Yanchunas J. Cader-Villafranca B.M. Dietze E.C. Schurke P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14957-14964Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the substitution of cysteine for histidine would afford a composite spectrum resulting from the ligation of Cu2+ in two binding sites. Importantly, EPR spectral parameters for Cu2+-S sites are not readily available from model compounds, due to the tendency of free thiols to reduce the Cu2+ to Cu+. Similarly, Cu2+-S sites in proteins are much less well characterized than Cu2+-N sites. Therefore, it is not straightforward to predict the spectral parameters to be expected for Cys-12 or Cys-4 ligation. In fact, a mutation-induced change in the spectrum would not only provide strong evidence for Cys ligation at the GS-GS interface, but may also provide a useful spectroscopic benchmark for Cys-ligated Cu2+ sites in other proteins. Titration of the H4C mutant resulted in a spectrum composed of two overlapping signals (Fig. 5,top). The double minimum in the g⊥ region is indicative of two distinct sites, as is the weak second set of hyperfine lines. This composite of two distinct spectral centers is apparent throughout the titration of the H4C mutant. The H12C mutant, on the other hand, exhibited strikingly different behavior (Fig. 5,bottom). At concentrations of metal below 1.0 eq/helix, only one copper signal is observed, based on the presence of only one set of hyperfine lines and only one minimum in the g⊥ spectral region. At approximately 1.0 eq/helix, however, the appearance of a second minimum in the g⊥ region and a second set of hyperfine lines, accompanied by a shift in the g⊥ value, indicates the filling of a second, spectrally distinct site. The appearance of a second set of spectral features upon substitution of one ligand type for another in the mutant proteins provides the first direct evidence for the identity of the ligands to Cu2+ and to the stoichiometry of Cu2+ binding. Cu2+ EPR spectroscopy has been used to determine the ligand identity and stoichiometry of the metal binding sites that are generated when N-terminal helices from GS subunits in adjacent dodecamers are juxtaposed in the stacked complex. Specifically, the results provide direct spectroscopic evidence that His-4 and His-12 each provide ligands to the metal ions bound at the dodecamer-dodecamer interface. Furthermore, the results show that, although Met-8 does not provide a direct metal ligand, it participates indirectly in the relative stabilization of the two sites. The behavior of the M8L and M8C mutants indicates a role for Met-8 in the stabilization of the two metal binding sites. Through comparison of these mutants to the wild type protein, a general trend may be observed. A spectral feature in the wild type enzyme EPR spectrum (Fig.3) is observed to be more prominent at low metal equivalency, but is masked at high equivalency of metal. The position of this spectral feature, centered at g = 2.03, corresponds exactly to the position of a prominent line in the spectrum of a Cu2+-HEPES buffer control. That this interference from buffer-bound copper should be more evident at lower concentrations of metal is to be expected. This interference is also observed in the spectra from the titration of the M8L mutant (Fig. 4, top). However, in this case, the magnitude of the contribution from buffer is much more pronounced at all concentrations of copper than that found in the wild type spectrum at equal concentrations. In the case of the M8C mutant, however (Fig.4, bottom), the spectral feature around g = 2.03 is absent at all concentrations of Cu2+. Importantly, the g⊥, g∥, and A∥ values for the protein-derived ligands do not vary significantly as a result of these mutations. This suggests that no metal-ligand bond is formed between the side chain of the residue at position 8 and the Cu2+ at either site. Rather, the only effect of mutation at this site is a change in linewidth due to incorporation of varying amounts of Cu2+-buffer signal, and we conclude that the effect of mutation at position 8 of the N-terminal helix is limited to an influence on the relative affinity of the two metal binding sites by indirect processes. Unfortunately, EPR is a poor method for measuringK d values, so quantitative comparison of the binding affinities for these and other mutants will require other methods. Previously published work utilized an H4A mutant protein, in which one of the two metal ligands has been eliminated (13Dabrowski M.J. Yanchunas J. Cader-Villafranca B.M. Dietze E.C. Schurke P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14957-14964Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This mutants stacks with apparent lower affinity for metal ions than wild type. Here, the spectra from the Cu2+ EPR titration of H4A GS were essentially identical those obtained with the wild type enzyme at higher concentrations of metal, i.e. 1.0 eq/subunit or greater. At 0.6 eq of Cu2+/subunit, however, the spectrum of H4A GS exhibits the same lineshape as wild type, but is much less intense. Because each of the putative metal binding sites in the N-terminal helix utilize two histidine ligands, the spectra observed for the two sites overlap to such a degree as to be essentially identical. However, the substitution of cysteines for one or the other of the histidines at the two binding sites was expected to yield spectra containing features of two distinct binding sites. The H4C mutant protein (Fig. 5, top) exhibits Cu2+-binding behavior unlike the wild type enzyme, or any of the position 8 mutants. At low equivalency of metal (0.2–0.6 eq of Cu2+) the hyperfine region of the spectrum contains approximately equal contributions from two populations of Cu2+ centers. The g = 2.00 to g = 2.06 region of the spectrum contains a nearly symmetrical double minimum and a local maximum at g = 2.01. These results are most consistent with the simultaneous ligation of Cu2+ by the cysteines at positions 4 and the histidyl side chains at positions 12 of the N-terminal helices. At concentrations of Cu2+ larger than 0.6 eq, however, one set of hyperfine lines (those corresponding to a native-like Cu2+-His site) becomes dominant. This causes an asymmetry in the g = 2.00–2.06 region of the spectrum, with the upfield minimum becoming more intense and a migration of the local maximum downfield to a value of g = 2.02. This behavior is due to a greater spectral contribution at higher concentrations of Cu2+ from the His site at positions 12 of the helix than that of the Cys site at positions 4. The H12C mutant protein provides the most striking evidence that there are two independent metal binding sites in the N-terminal helix. Furthermore, unlike the case of the H4C mutant, the two sites appear to fill sequentially (Fig. 5, bottom). At concentrations below 1.0 eq of Cu2+, the spectrum of the copper-bound H12C protein appears to be an almost homogeneous spectrum with one set of hyperfine lines and one minimum in the g⊥ region. A minor perturbation due to a small amount of interference from Cu2+-buffer complexes is observed at g = 2.03, as was previously observed in the wild type titration. This single set of spectral features most likely corresponds to the binding of a single population of Cu2+ to the cysteines engineered into the protein at positions 12 of the N-terminal helix. At approximately 1.0 eq of Cu2+, however, a second set of hyperfine lines begin to appear, accompanied by a second minimum. With increasing Cu2+, the second set of spectral features eventually results in a local maximum at approximately g = 2.02. The addition of a second population of bound copper also results in a very small but significant upfield migration of the g⊥ value. Whereas in the case of the H4C mutant, where both sites are populated to some extent at all concentrations of Cu2+ and as a result the averaged g⊥ value of the two sites does not significantly vary, the gradual addition of a second population of bound copper with a slightly different g⊥ value results in the observed change for the H12C mutant. These spectral changes correspond to the binding of a second, spectrally distinct, population of Cu2+ to the native histidines at positions 4 of the N-terminal helices. This second observed set of spectral features, however, do not attain the same magnitude as those of the features observed below 1.0 eq of Cu2+. This result was also observed in a titration with steps of 0.1 eq of Cu2+, and the results were identical; the appearance of the second set of spectral features begins at 1.0 eq of Cu2+, with the second set never reaching the same intensity as the first. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the N-terminal helix of glutamine synthetase contains two distinct metal binding sites, at positions 4 and 12 of the helices. These two sites do not appear to interact electronically, as there is no evidence of anti-ferromagnetic exchange between them. This is not surprising in light of the distance between metal ions at these sites, ∼13 Å, and the presence of residues between them at position 8 of the helix, which do not directly participate in metal binding. Furthermore, the results allow us to suggest that the 12-site is preferred over the position 4-site in the N-terminal metal binding region of GS. In both mutants where one of the native histidines was replaced with cysteine, spectral features from a Cu2+-His site and a Cu2+-Cys site are observed. In the case of the H4C mutant, both sites appear to be nearly equally populated at low equivalency of metal, but at intermediate to high concentrations, the spectral features arising from copper bound to the native histidines at the 12-site become dominant. In the case of the H12C mutant, the difference is more striking: The Cys site at position 12 fills completely before the His site at position 4 is occupied by Cu2+. In both cases, the spectral features derived from the copper-filled 12-site are more intense than those arising from the copper-filled 4-site. This observation leads us to suggest that the 12-site binds copper sufficiently tightly to yield full occupancy of the site. In contrast, binding of copper at the 4-site may be sufficiently lower in affinity to result in partial occupancy on the EPR time scale at the highest Cu2+ concentrations used. Notably, once an apparent maximum spectral intensity of the 4-site was achieved, the spectral contribution from that site did not increase with increasing concentration of metal ion. If partial occupancy is the cause for the decreased intensity, then it must be due to rapid exchange of the Cu2+-N or Cu2+-S at the 4-site with bulk solvated Cu2+, rather than failure to saturate the site. That is, binding of Cu2+ at the 4-site may be sufficiently dynamic to account for decreased intensity. A potential explanation for this behavior is apparent from a model for the GS-GS complex based on the crystal structure of the S. typhimurium protein (Fig. 1). The spectra observed for these sites by EPR are consistent with those of nitrogen bound copper ions (18Knowles P.F. Marsh D. Rattle H.W.E. Magnetic Resonance of Biomolecules. John Wiley & Sons, New York1976Google Scholar, 19Vanngard T. Swartz H.M. Bolton J.R. Borg D.C. Biological Applications of Electron Spin Resonance.

In this case, histidines bind Cu2+ in a linear bidentate arrangement, functioning as the dominant ligands, while contacts to bulk water are presumed to provide the rest of the ligand field, as there is no evidence of participation by other protein-derived ligands. Because of this geometry, the conformations adopted by the ligands at the 4 and 12 positions are critical to their ability to bind metal. According to our model, the histidines at position 12 are directed between the helices at an angle very close to optimal for this type of binding. Hence, Cu2+ can bind at the 12-site with a minimum of induced strain. The histidines at position 4, however, are not so ideally positioned. Due to the helical twist, the side chains of position 4 are directed to either side of the plane defined by the two helical axes. As a result, alignment of these two histidines to adopt ligand field geometry similar to that found at position 12 incurs some strain, rendering the position 4-site a less desirable ligand field. This model is consistent with our observation that Cu2+-binding at position 12 is preferred relative to position 4. Adding a further level of complexity to the model, however, is the presence of glutamic acid residues in the immediate vicinity of each of the two histidines. Residues Glu-3 and Glu-11 can adopt conformations suitable for the formation of a hydrogen bond between the carboxylate group of the glutamate and Nδ1 of the histidine imidazole ring opposite the metal-binding Nε2. This type of “off-side” hydrogen bond has been implicated in the stabilization of metal-imidazole bonds (22Nakagawa S. Umeyama H. Kitaura K. Morokuma K. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1981; 29: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23McGrath M.E. Haymore B.L. Summers N.L. Craik C.S. Fletterick R.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1914-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Christianson D.W. Alexander R.S. Nature. 1990; 346: 225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the case of GS, the formation of an off-side hydrogen bond stabilizes the near-optimal metal binding conformation of the His-12 ligands; however, the formation of a similar interaction between Glu-3 and His-4 results in the stabilization of a less ideal ligand field, as mentioned above. Thus, for the His-4 site, an intrahelical hydrogen bond may compete with the conformation of His-4 required to form an interhelical metal binding site, and reduce the apparent affinity for metal. Another potential distinction between the two sites that might contribute to the observed difference in binding behavior is the presence of a glutamate residue at position 13 which has no structural analogue at position 5. Although Glu-13 is not situated well for hydrogen bonding to His-12, the presence of an additional negatively charged residue in the vicinity of the 12-site may contribute significantly to the difference in the electrostatic attraction of the two sites toward metal cations. In addition to these other factors, this contrast in electrostatics may be sufficient to provide differential affinity for the two sites. It is useful to keep in mind that the site under study is not necessarily occupied by Cu2+ ions in the native state of the protein, nor has it any catalytic or redox activity associated with it. Rather, it is a unique intermolecular metal binding site which will bind copper, or a variety of other metals. Because of this difference, it would not be entirely unexpected that this site would not conform completely to any classically described, native copper site type. Nevertheless, a comparison of the findings to classically described sites is appropriate. As mentioned above, the two sites in the N-terminal helix of GS act independently of each other, and there is no indication of anti-ferromagnetic exchange between them; therefore, a type 3 site can be ruled out. Similarly, the absence of a strong blue color corresponding to a large absorption at ∼600 nm or very narrow hyperfine splitting characteristic of the blue-copper proteins allows us to rule out the type 1 site. Because the A∥ values for these sites are all greater than 1.4 × 10−4cm−1 and no absorbance at λ = 600 nm is observed, these copper centers are best classified as type 2 sites. Moreover, in light of the paucity of well characterized Cu2+-S systems resulting from their tendency to undergo redox reactions, our results are of considerable interest as models for EPR parameters in proteins with Cu2+-S bonds. Most importantly, our results identify directly the metal-binding ligands that are responsible for the “stacking” phenomenon observed in E. coli glutamine synthetase. By replacing the native histidines that were previously reported as suspected ligands with other potential ligands, we have generated spectra that are composites of two distinct populations of bound copper. We have used these results to demonstrate that there are two separate binding sites for metal on the N-terminal helix, and that the site between positions 12 of a given “helix dimer” is preferred over the site formed between positions 4, based on the spectral features observed. We have also shown that the side chain at position 8 of the N-terminal helix does not directly ligate to either metal ion."
