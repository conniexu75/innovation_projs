https://openalex.org/W2076607489,"While the spring phytoplankton bloom in Newfoundland coastal waters is in progress during April and May, at water temperatures between -1 degrees and +2 degrees C, bacterial growth and respiratory rates remain low. Microbial community respiration is not measurable at -0.2 degrees C. Particulate materials that would be utilized by microorganisms in 2 to 3 days at 20 degrees to 25 degrees C require 11 days at 4 degrees C and 18 days at -0.2 degrees C. Thus, photosynthesis is active but microbial utilization of the products is suppressed. High secondary production in cold water may result from the low rate of microbial decomposition, enabling herbivores to utilize much of the primary production."

Pavoninins, the steroid glycosides with shark-repelling ability, had previously been isolated therefrom. Each pardaxin consists of 33 amino acid residues having a distinctly hydrophilic carboxyl terminal region and a predominantly hydrophobic remainder; the pardaxin is thus strongly surfactant. These peptides show marked physical and pharmacological similarities to melittin, the major active constituent of bee venom, yet they lack sequence homology. They are probably also responsible for the predator-repelling property of the sole."
https://openalex.org/W2064567530,"This article is a personal reflection of the branch of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics called the linear response theory that has as its heart the fluctuation-dissipation thereom, which states that irreversible processes ip nonequilibrium are necessarily related to thermal fluctuations in equilibrium. Its origi lies in the Einstein relation for the diffusion constant and the mobility of a Brownian particle. The short history of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is described. Then the linear response theory is brifly summarized and the meaning of stochastization is considered. The Langevin equation approach and its extensions are reviewed."
https://openalex.org/W2151021996,"A Japanese database on research and development that disaggregates an industry's intramural expenditure into 31 different product fields is used tp measure technological diversification. Sectoral patterts are identified in terms of upstream, downstream, and horizontal diversification-that is, respectively, diversification of an industry's research and development activities into product fields that are industrial inputs of that industry, into those that are outputs, and diversification that is not directed through the path of input-output relations. The pattern of the electronics industry is identified as downstream diversification whereas that of the chemical industry is identified as horizontal. The declining industry is generally making upstream diversification. Japanese corporate and governmental policies, such as trade policy, industrial policy, and the research association scheme, have accelerated technological diversification."

The dominance of these acids parallels the abundance of the corresponding hydrocarbons pristane and phytane."

Rearing with different substrates or exercise of the claws revealed that claw laterality is determined in the central nervous system by differential reflex activity in the paired claws; the side with greater activity becomes the crusher, while the contralateral side becomes the cutter."
https://openalex.org/W1980431819,"During a 15-day experiment, green anoles, Anolis carolinensis, were: (i) presented with one of two aposematic insects, Oncopeltus fasciatus or Photinus pyralis, during days 4, 6, and 8; (ii) maintained on one of four different food levels during days 9-14; and (iii) presented with the original model on day 15. Lizards on low rations tended to capture more Photinus on day 15 than did anoles on higher rations. No such correlation was observed with Oncopeltus."
https://openalex.org/W2059702084,"Chemostratigraphic analyses in the Ordovician-Silurian boundary stratotype section, bracketing a major extinction event in the graptolitic shale section at Dob's Linn, Scotland, show persistently high iridium concentrations of 0.050 to 0.250 parts per billion. There is no iridiumn concentration spike in the boundary interval or elsewhere in the 13 graptolite zones examined encompassing about 20 million years. Iridium correlated with chromium, both elements showing a gradual decrease with time into the middle part of the Lower Silurian. The chromium-iridium ratio averages about 10(6). Paleogeographic and geologic reconstructions coupled with the occurrence of ophiolites and other deep crustal rocks in the source area suggest that the high iridium and chromium concentrations observed in the shales result from terrestrial erosion of exposed upper mantle ultramafic rocks rather than from a cataclysmic extraterrestrial event."
https://openalex.org/W2057766169,"The tropopause has been detected by ultrasensitive, narrow-beam, microwave (10.7-centimeter) and ultrahigh-frequency (71.5-cm) radars. Its reflectivity is consistent with that expected theoretically for a refractively turbulent medium. Indications are that the layer is also mechanically turbulent, and that electromagnetic scatter techniques may be used to detect high-altitude clear-air turbulence."

https://openalex.org/W2043651737,"A strain of Brassica campestris L. responds to a single photoinductive cycle 4 days after sowing. Extending the photoperiod from 8 to 22 or 24 hours, with incandescent light of 538-lux intensity, induced inflorescence in 90 percent of the plants. Inflorescence development was visible on dissection 5 or 6 days after photoinduction. Floral induction increased with duration and intensity of the supplementary light."

Effective input power was approximately 3 milliwatts. The results suggest that the piezoelectric method may be applicable to similar experiments at much higher frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W1980631078,"Japan has experienced many major earthquake disasters in the past. Early in this century research began that was aimed at predicting the occurrence of earthquakes, and in 1965 an earthquake prediction program was started as a national project. In 1978 a program for constant monitoring and assessment was formally inaugurated with the goal of forecasting the major earthquake that is expected to occur in the near future in the Tokai district of central Honshu Island. The issue of predicting the anticipated Tokai earthquake is discussed in this article as well as the results of research on major recent earthquakes in Japan-the Izu earthquakes (1978 and 1980) and the Japan Sea earthquake (1983)."
https://openalex.org/W2169781103,"Until recently the Japanese did not spend much on research and what they did spend was concentrated on the commercial development of technology. As a result there have so far been few Japanese breakthroughs in either science or technology. Dramatic changes have recently occurred, however, and Japan now trails only the United States and the Soviet Union in research spending. Beyond this, Japanese policy-makers are making a determined effort to overcome Japan's social and institutional barriers to scientific creativity."
https://openalex.org/W2002905465,"An infrared observation of the dark side of Mercury made by Pettit and Nicholson in 1923 led them to suggest that the planet rotates nonsynchronously. Their early measurements, if taken at face value, would imply a brightness temperature of about 180Â°K for the dark side. The asymmetry of the infrared phase curve is further interpreted as suggesting direct rotation."

https://openalex.org/W2159401698,Japanese-style management and industrial policy are shown to serve as a source of industrial dynamism and are used as a way to illminate what is wrong with the American system. Japanese labor practices-specifically extra hours of unpaid work-are seen as a form of insurance fee that the worker pays in exchange for job security.
https://openalex.org/W1989008186,"Maps have been made of the 2-centimeter brightness distribution of M17, Cassiopeia-A, Taurus-A, and Orion nebula with a resolution of 2.3 minutes of arc, revealing several newly resolved features. M17 is a double thermal source. Some structure appears in Cassiopeia-A, including a suggestion of a ring shape. Taurus-A exhibits a brightness map similar to that obtained in earlier low-frequency results. The central part of Orion nebula is circularly symmetric to a high degree of accuracy."

https://openalex.org/W2091971713,"The technical-planning and decision-making processes involved in the initiation of the NASA Space Shuttle program in 1970-1972 are briefly discussed, responding to the critical evaluation of Logsdon (1986). The complex nature of the interactions among White House, OMB, DOD, and NASA; the difficulty of making long-term commitments under the U.S. system; the positive technological achievements of the program; and the need for unemotional evaluation of the policy options available after the loss of the Challenger are stressed. In a reply by Logsdon, it is argued that the structuring of the policy process itself and the presentation of the Shuttle to Congress as a relatively inexpensive routine launch system for virtually all government needs were directly related to its failure to gain continuing full funding from Administrations and Congress. It is suggested that a strong proposal of bold scientific and exploratory objectives for the space program could be more successful in gaining such long-term support."
