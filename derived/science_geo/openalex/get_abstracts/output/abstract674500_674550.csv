https://openalex.org/W3161466741,"Organoids capable of forming tissue-like structures have transformed our ability to model human development and disease. With the notable exception of the human heart, lineage-specific self-organizing organoids have been reported for all major organs. Here, we established self-organizing cardioids from human pluripotent stem cells that intrinsically specify, pattern, and morph into chamber-like structures containing a cavity. Cardioid complexity can be controlled by signaling that instructs the separation of cardiomyocyte and endothelial layers and by directing epicardial spreading, inward migration, and differentiation. We find that cavity morphogenesis is governed by a mesodermal WNT-BMP signaling axis and requires its target HAND1, a transcription factor linked to developmental heart chamber defects. Upon cryoinjury, cardioids initiated a cell-type-dependent accumulation of extracellular matrix, an early hallmark of both regeneration and heart disease. Thus, human cardioids represent a powerful platform to mechanistically dissect self-organization, congenital heart defects and serve as a foundation for future translational research."

Programmed frameshifting occurs during translation, when the ribosome encounters a stimulatory pseudoknot RNA fold. Using a combination of cryo–electron microscopy and biochemistry, Bhatt et al. revealed that the pseudoknot resists unfolding as it lodges at the entry of the ribosomal messenger RNA channel. This causes back slippage of the viral RNA, resulting in a minus-1 shift of the reading frame of translation. A partially folded nascent viral polyprotein forms specific interactions inside the ribosomal tunnel that can influence the efficiency of frameshifting. Science , abf3546, this issue p. 1306"

To assemble a comprehensive ccRCC tumor microenvironment (TME) atlas, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic subpopulations from tumor and tumor-adjacent tissue of treatment-naive ccRCC resections. We leveraged the VIPER algorithm to quantitate single-cell protein activity and validated this approach by comparison to flow cytometry. The analysis identified key TME subpopulations, as well as their master regulators and candidate cell-cell interactions, revealing clinically relevant populations, undetectable by gene-expression analysis. Specifically, we uncovered a tumor-specific macrophage subpopulation characterized by upregulation of TREM2/APOE/C1Q, validated by spatially resolved, quantitative multispectral immunofluorescence. In a large clinical validation cohort, these markers were significantly enriched in tumors from patients who recurred following surgery. The study thus identifies TREM2/APOE/C1Q-positive macrophage infiltration as a potential prognostic biomarker for ccRCC recurrence, as well as a candidate therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W3165749734,"Gasdermin B (GSDMB) belongs to a large family of pore-forming cytolysins that execute inflammatory cell death programs. While genetic studies have linked GSDMB polymorphisms to human disease, its function in the immunological response to pathogens remains poorly understood. Here, we report a dynamic host-pathogen conflict between GSDMB and the IpaH7.8 effector protein secreted by enteroinvasive Shigella flexneri. We show that IpaH7.8 ubiquitinates and targets GSDMB for 26S proteasome destruction. This virulence strategy protects Shigella from the bacteriocidic activity of natural killer cells by suppressing granzyme-A-mediated activation of GSDMB. In contrast to the canonical function of most gasdermin family members, GSDMB does not inhibit Shigella by lysing host cells. Rather, it exhibits direct microbiocidal activity through recognition of phospholipids found on Gram-negative bacterial membranes. These findings place GSDMB as a central executioner of intracellular bacterial killing and reveal a mechanism employed by pathogens to counteract this host defense system."
https://openalex.org/W3094140138,"Background Supportive parenting is critical for promoting healthy child development in the face of stressors, such as those occurring during COVID-19. Here, we address a knowledge gap regarding specific household risk factors associated with parenting quality during the pandemic and incorporate first-person accounts of family challenges and needs. Methods Mixed methods were applied to data collected between April 14th - 28th, 2020 from the “Parenting During the Pandemic” survey. Participants included 656 primary caregivers (e.g., mothers, fathers, foster parents) of least one child age 1.5–8 years of which 555 (84.6%) responded to at least one parenting questionnaire. Parenting quality was assessed across stressful, negative, and positive parenting dimensions. Household risk was examined across pandemic- linked (e.g., caregiver depression, unmet childcare needs) and stable factors (i.e., annual income, mental illness history). Significant correlates were examined with regressions in Mplus. Thematic analysis identified caregiver challenges and unmet needs from open-ended questions. Findings Caregiver depression, higher child parity, unmet childcare needs, and relationship distress predicted lower-quality parenting. Caregiver depression was the most significant predictor across every parenting dimension, with analyses indicating medium effect sizes, ds = .39 - .73. Qualitative findings highlighted severe strains on parent capacities including managing psychological distress, limited social supports, and too much unstructured time. Interpretations Lower quality parenting during COVID-19 is associated with multiple household and pandemic risk factors, with caregiver depression consistently linked to parent- child relationship disruptions. Focused efforts are needed to address caregiver mental health to protect child health as part of the pandemic response."

To interrogate this diversity during human development, we generate a single-cell transcriptome atlas from multiple developing endodermal organs of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. We illuminate cell states, transcription factors, and organ-specific epithelial stem cell and mesenchyme interactions across lineages. We implement the atlas as a high-dimensional search space to benchmark human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived intestinal organoids (HIOs) under multiple culture conditions. We show that HIOs recapitulate reference cell states and use HIOs to reconstruct the molecular dynamics of intestinal epithelium and mesenchyme emergence. We show that the mesenchyme-derived niche cue NRG1 enhances intestinal stem cell maturation in vitro and that the homeobox transcription factor CDX2 is required for regionalization of intestinal epithelium and mesenchyme in humans.

This work combines cell atlases and organoid technologies to understand how human organ development is orchestrated. The human body is composed of an extraordinary diversity of cells that originate from a zygote. Although much about embryogenesis and organogenesis has been revealed using non-human model organisms, differences between human and model organism development highlight the need for human models (Miller et al., 2018Miller A.J.

Human atlases also serve as a gold-standard reference for human cell and tissue engineering, enabling fidelity assessment of in vitro models. Organoids are three-dimensional multicellular culture systems that recapitulate aspects of human physiology. Organoids are attractive model systems because they can be manipulated genetically, observed in controlled in vitro environments over time, and derived from individuals with diverse genetic backgrounds. There are many protocols to generate organoids from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that resemble different organ or tissue types (Kechele and Wells, 2019Kechele D.O. Wells J.M.

Genet. 2018; 19: 671-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and each system has similarities to and differences from the primary counterpart. Here we use hPSC-derived intestinal organoids (HIOs) as a multilineage model system to study intestinal development (Spence et al., 2011Spence J.R. Mayhew C.N. Rankin S.A. Kuhar M.F. Vallance J.E.

HIOs are thought to recapitulate the earliest phases of organ specification and complex tissue formation. Generating HIOs relies on directed differentiation through temporal manipulation of key signaling pathways via growth factors and small molecules to mimic intestinal organogenesis (McCracken et al., 2011McCracken K.W.

Nevertheless, the emergence of cellular diversity within HIOs has not yet been resolved comprehensively. Here we established a single-cell transcriptome atlas covering multiple developing endodermal organs along the human respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. We used this atlas to identify transient and differentiated cell states across diverse cell lineages, highlight transcriptional regulators that correlate with cell fate specification, and provide evidence that mesenchyme communicates with epithelial stem cells through organ- and subpopulation-specific features. Next, we benchmarked cellular composition and molecular profiles in in vitro and in vivo HIOs. We further quantified the similarity to primary counterparts and identified off-target cell types and use HIOs to track the early steps of intestinal epithelial stem cell development and the emergence of mesenchymal populations. We deployed the reference atlas to determine that NRG1, an intestinal stem cell niche factor secreted by the subepithelial mesenchyme, promoted maturation of intestinal epithelial stem cells in HIOs beyond the maturation state observed under standard growth conditions. Finally, we found that the intestinal master regulator CDX2 is required for human intestinal epithelial cell fate specification and appropriate patterning of gut-associated mesenchyme. We established a developing human multi-organ reference cell atlas focusing on endoderm-derived organs by integrating newly generated and published single-cell (sc) transcriptomes from lung, esophagus, liver, stomach, small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), and colon (155,232 cells in total) with an age distribution from 7–21 post-conception weeks (PCWs) (Figure 1A; Tables S1 and S2; key resources table; Holloway et al., 2020Holloway E.M.

We integrated all of the developing human scRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data using cluster similarity spectrum (CSS) (He et al., 2020He Z. Brazovskaja A. Ebert S. Camp J.G. Treutlein B. CSS: cluster similarity spectrum integration of single-cell genomics data.Genome Biol. 2020; 21: 224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to correct for batch effects. Clustering resolved major cell classes, including epithelial, mesenchymal, immune, endothelial, neuronal, and erythroid populations (Figures 1B and 1C), that could be subdivided into 27 molecularly distinct clusters (Figures 1D and S1A). Some epithelial and mesenchymal clusters were dominated by a specific organ, whereas neural, immune, and endothelial clusters contained cells from multiple organs (Figure S1A). We further quantified the organ specificity of each of these classes by examining the proportion of cells showing transcriptomes similar to one or more other organs (Figure S1B). It showed that epithelial and mesenchymal cells exhibited the strongest organ specificity. We identified transcription factors (TFs) with enriched expression in the epithelium and mesenchyme of each organ (Figure S1C). These results established a higher-order map of cell populations and associated marker genes across 11 regions of 5 developing human organs.Figure S1Characterization of the developing human multi-organ cell atlas, related to Figure 1Show full captionA) The dendrogram shows cluster similarity (Pearson) based on highly variable genes, with selected cell class markers, top cluster marker genes, and a sidebar showing the proportion of cells of each organ per cluster.

This analysis identified a total of 39 clusters, recovering previously known epithelial cell types of each organ (Figures 2A–2D; Table S2; Data S1 at https://doi.org/10.17632/x53tts3zfr.1). Next we extracted stem cell clusters from each organ to determine inter-organ similarities and differences (Figure 2E). We identified common genes that associate with stem cells throughout the organ atlas (Table S3; STAR Methods), and these genes were enriched for gene ontologies related to metabolism (glycolysis and gluconeogenesis) and translation initiation. We also observed differences between stem cells among different organs and tissues, indicated by separation of clusters (Becht et al., 2018Becht E. McInnes L. Healy J. Dutertre C.A. Kwok I.W.H. Ng L.G. Ginhoux F. Newell E.W. Dimensionality reduction for visualizing single-cell data using UMAP.Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 37: 38-44Crossref Scopus (743) Google Scholar; Figure 2E). We ordered the stem cells in a pseudospatial trajectory according to regional identity score (Figure 2F; STAR Methods). This revealed distinctions among organs as well as progressive transition from anterior to posterior in the intestine. Organ specificity was highlighted by stem cell markers of the stomach and intestine, LGR5 and OLFM4 (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M.

Although LGR5 is expressed throughout the stem cell populations of the stomach and intestine, OLFM4 is highly enriched in a subpopulation of small intestine stem cells (Figure 2E).

Many of these TFs have unexplored roles in specification or maintenance of tissue-specific stemness. These data provide a catalog of molecular profiles that mark cell types along the developing human endoderm-derived epithelium. We next analyzed neuronal and mesenchymal cell diversity in the developing organs. We cataloged 6 glial and 8 neuronal clusters, most of which were distributed among the organs, and we provide marker genes for diverse cell populations of the developing human enteric nervous system (Data S1). Next we cataloged 21 molecularly distinct mesenchymal clusters (Figure 3A; Table S2; Data S1), identifying known subpopulations, such as vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs; cluster 2 [c2], DES+/RGS5+), interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs; c4, ANO1+/KIT+), and chondrocyte-like cells (c21, SOX9+/COL9A3+), as well as novel subpopulations, such as GDF10+ (c8, GDF10+/WNT2B+) and SERPINF1-high (c20, SERPINF1+/ABCA8+) cells. We find that lung-associated mesenchyme is largely distinct from that of the stomach and intestine, and we identified TFs and signaling molecules that codify lung and GI tract identity (Figures 3B and S1C). We validated the TF NKX2-3 and secreted factor WNT2 as general markers that distinguish intestine and lung mesenchyme, respectively (Figure 3C; Data S1). Further, the TF SALL1 specifically marks F3+ subepithelial mesenchyme (c15, subepithelial, NRG1+/F3+) in the stomach and intestine, whereas the TF PRRX1 marks chondrocyte-like SERPINF1-high cells and pericytes in the lung (Figures 3B and 3C; Data S1). We also observed signatures that distinguish mesenchyme populations along the GI tract. For example, homeobox genes showed anterior-posterior expression patterns reminiscent of other model systems and human adult tissues (Chang et al., 2002Chang H.Y. Chi J.T. Dudoit S. Bondre C. van de Rijn M. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Diversity, topographic differentiation, and positional memory in human fibroblasts.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

CellPhoneDB: inferring cell-cell communication from combined expression of multi-subunit ligand-receptor complexes.Nat. Protoc. 2020; 15: 1484-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we cataloged interactions between epithelium and mesenchymal populations and identified many pairings that were enriched in particular organs (Figure 3E; Data S1). For example, a LGR5-RSPO3 receptor-ligand pairing was enriched in epithelial stem cell and mesenchyme in the stomach, small intestine, and colon. The multi-organ sc transcriptome reference atlas unveils a rich resource of transcriptional and inter-lineage signaling programs that are specific to cell populations within each organ and may coordinate mesenchymal-epithelial signaling in organ-specific stem cell niches. We next sought to use the atlas to understand the fidelity of intestinal organoids. We generated HIOs derived from embryonic stem cells and analyzed cellular heterogeneity 4 and 8 weeks after in vivo transplantation into the kidney capsule of an immunocompromised mouse host (Figures 4A and 4B ). Transplanted HIOs (tHIOs) exhibited hallmarks of epithelium maturation similar to that in the developing human intestine, including emergence of stereotypic crypt-villus architecture (Figure 4C; Finkbeiner et al., 2015bFinkbeiner S.R.

We performed scRNA-seq on tHIOs and observed ISCs (c6, LGR5+/OLFM4+), enterocyte precursors (c7, FABP2+/APOA4 low), enterocytes (c8, FABP2+/APOA4+), enteroendocrine cells (c9, CHGA+/ISL1+), M cells (c10, SPIB+/CA7+), and goblet cells (c11, MUC2+/SPINK4+) (Figures 4F and 4G; Data S1). We detected additional epithelial clusters (c12–c15) that lacked the expression of intestinal marker genes such as CDX2 and instead expressed foregut markers such as MUC5AC, SOX2, and FOXJ1 (Data S1). They accounted for 34.0% (1,082 of 3,182) of sequenced epithelial cells. We also identified diverse mesenchymal clusters (c1–c5), including VSMCs (c5, DES+/RGS5+) and CXCL14+ mesenchyme (c4, CXCL14+/NSG1+). We noticed that SFRP2+ mesenchyme (c2, SFRP2+/PRRX1+) lacked expression of the intestine marker NKX2-3 (Data S1) and showed enriched expression of PRRX1, which is highly expressed in the developing lung. This foregut-like off-target mesenchymal subtype accounts for 27.6% (187 of 678) of sequenced tHIO mesenchymal cells. To provide a quantitative assessment of tHIO transcriptome fidelity, we calculated the distance of each tHIO cell to the developing multi-organ atlas and projected tHIO cells to the reference (Figures 4H, 4I, and S1D). We found that approximately 70% of tHIO epithelial and mesenchymal cells were mapped to the developing human intestine, and these on-target proportions were similar to qualitative assessments based on organ-specific markers.

We studied the evolution of glycan-reactive B cells of rhesus macaques and humans using glycosylated HIV-1 envelope (Env) as a model antigen. 2G12 is a broadly neutralizing Ab (bnAb) that targets a conserved glycan patch on Env of geographically diverse HIV-1 strains using a unique heavy-chain (VH) domain-swapped architecture that results in fragment antigen-binding (Fab) dimerization. Here, we describe HIV-1 Env Fab-dimerized glycan (FDG)-reactive bnAbs without VH-swapped domains from simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected macaques. FDG Abs also recognized cell-surface glycans on diverse pathogens, including yeast and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike. FDG precursors were expanded by glycan-bearing immunogens in macaques and were abundant in HIV-1-naive humans. Moreover, FDG precursors were predominately mutated IgM+IgD+CD27+, thus suggesting that they originated from a pool of antigen-experienced IgM+ or marginal zone B cells."
https://openalex.org/W3160989313,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused unparalleled disruption of global behavior and significant loss of life. To minimize SARS-CoV-2 spread, understanding the mechanisms of infection from all possible routes of entry is essential. While aerosol transmission is thought to be the primary route of spread, viral particles have been detected in ocular fluid, suggesting that the eye may be a vulnerable point of viral entry. To this end, we confirmed SARS-CoV-2 entry factor and antigen expression in post-mortem COVID-19 patient ocular surface tissue and observed productive viral replication in cadaver samples and eye organoid cultures, most notably in limbal regions. Transcriptional analysis of ex vivo infected ocular surface cells and hESC-derived eye cultures revealed robust induction of NF-κB in infected cells as well as diminished type I/III interferon signaling. Together these data suggest that the eye can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2 and implicate limbus as a portal for viral entry."
https://openalex.org/W3161054021,"Decision-making is a cognitive process of central importance for the quality of our lives. Here, we ask whether a common factor underpins our diverse decision-making abilities. We obtained 32 decision-making measures from 830 young people and identified a common factor that we call ""decision acuity,"" which was distinct from IQ and reflected a generic decision-making ability. Decision acuity was decreased in those with aberrant thinking and low general social functioning. Crucially, decision acuity and IQ had dissociable brain signatures, in terms of their associated neural networks of resting-state functional connectivity. Decision acuity was reliably measured, and its relationship with functional connectivity was also stable when measured in the same individuals 18 months later. Thus, our behavioral and brain data identify a new cognitive construct that underpins decision-making ability across multiple domains. This construct may be important for understanding mental health, particularly regarding poor social function and aberrant thought patterns."

This study aims to determine the LULCC against topography in Cameron Highlands between 2009 and 2019 by using geospatial techniques to analyze Landsat 7 (ETM+) and 8 (OLI/TIRS), ASTER GDEM and MODIS imaging sensors. The results showed a decline of 35.98 km2 in primary forests over ten years across the Cameron Highlands, while agricultural lands and urban areas flourished by a rise of 51.61 km2 and 11.00 km2 respectively. It can be noted that the elevation most affected is between 1000 and 1500 m, across all classes. Further results showed the expansion of both agriculture and urban development onto slopes above 35°, leading to an instability of soil structure. In a comparison of the base years of 2009 with 2019, mean LST results have shown temperatures rising by 7.5°C, while an average between 3 and 4°C across the region is recorded. The results obtained provide new information for government bodies and land planners to coordinate their actions without further jeopardizing the environment of the Cameron Highlands."
https://openalex.org/W3162583228,"Niemann–Pick C (NPC) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2 genes encoding endolysosomal lipid transport proteins, leading to cholesterol accumulation and autophagy dysfunction. We have previously shown that enrichment of NPC1-deficient cells with the anionic lipid lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA; also called bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate) via treatment with its precursor phosphatidylglycerol (PG) results in a dramatic decrease in cholesterol storage. However, the mechanisms underlying this reduction are unknown. In the present study, we showed using biochemical and imaging approaches in both NPC1-deficient cellular models and an NPC1 mouse model that PG incubation/LBPA enrichment significantly improved the compromised autophagic flux associated with NPC1 disease, providing a route for NPC1-independent endolysosomal cholesterol mobilization. PG/LBPA enrichment specifically enhanced the late stages of autophagy, and effects were mediated by activation of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase. PG incubation also led to robust and specific increases in LBPA species with polyunsaturated acyl chains, potentially increasing the propensity for membrane fusion events, which are critical for late-stage autophagy progression. Finally, we demonstrated that PG/LBPA treatment efficiently cleared cholesterol and toxic protein aggregates in Purkinje neurons of the NPC1I1061T mouse model.

Kahn P.C. Storch J. Intracellular cholesterol trafficking is dependent upon NPC2 interaction with lysobisphosphatidic acid.Elife. 2019; 8e50832Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Direct supplementation with LBPA also reduced cholesterol accumulation in NPC1-deficient cells (27Chevallier J. Chamoun Z. Jiang G. Prestwich G. Sakai N. Matile S. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Lysobisphosphatidic acid controls endosomal cholesterol levels.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27871-27880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Of note, PG/LBPA enrichment of NPC2-deficient cells was unable to induce cholesterol clearance (25McCauliff L.A. Langan A. Li R. Ilnytska O. Bose D. Waghalter M. Lai K. Kahn P.C. Storch J. Intracellular cholesterol trafficking is dependent upon NPC2 interaction with lysobisphosphatidic acid.Elife. 2019; 8e50832Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, NPC2 and LBPA work together to traffic cholesterol through the LE/LY compartment via a process that can apparently bypass NPC1. However, the precise mechanism of this NPC2-dependent, NPC1-independent cholesterol egress from the endolysosomal compartment is unknown. We recently showed that PG incubation of NPC1-deficient cells leads to an increase in exosome biogenesis and cholesterol secretion (28Ilnytska O. Jeziorek M. Lai K. Altan-Bonnet N. Dobrowolski R. Storch J. Lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) enrichment promotes cholesterol egress via exosomes in Niemann Pick type C1 deficient cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Biol.

In this report we demonstrate that PG/LBPA enrichment of NPC1-deficient cells also reverses the impaired fusion of AP with LY, resulting in an improvement of autophagic flux, and that this induction of autophagy also serves as a route for endolysosomal cholesterol efflux. The stimulation of autophagic maturation occurs, at least in part, through activation of acid sphingomyelinase, known to be suppressed in NPC1 cells (29Devlin C. Pipalia N.H. Liao X. Schuchman E.H.

In addition, we present proof-of-concept data demonstrating LBPA induction of cholesterol clearance and autophagic flux in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neuronal NPC1 cells and in an NPC1 animal model, supporting the therapeutic potential of PG/LBPA enrichment for treatment of the fatal neurodegenerative disorder NPC1. We previously reported that supplementation of primary fibroblasts from NPC1 patients with liposomes composed of 100% dioleoyl-PG resulted in LBPA enrichment and marked cholesterol egress from endolysosomal compartments (25McCauliff L.A.

Intracellular cholesterol trafficking is dependent upon NPC2 interaction with lysobisphosphatidic acid.Elife. 2019; 8e50832Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To further explore the mechanism of PG/LBPA action, we first complemented our studies in the GM03123 human NPC1-deficient dermal fibroblast line (25McCauliff L.A. Langan A. Li R. Ilnytska O. Bose D.

The GM03123 line is a compound heterozygote harboring a P237S mutation in one allele and a second allele with an I1061T mutation (Coriell Cell Repository); thus, the HeLa KO cells allowed us to rule out a potential role of residual NPC1 protein in the NPC1-mutant fibroblasts. We also examined differentiated neural stem cells (NSCs) generated from the GM03123 NPC1-mutant fibroblasts via iPSC reprograming (31Yu D. Swaroop M. Wang M. Baxa U. Yang R. Yan Y. Coksaygan T.

To induce the accumulation of LDL-derived cholesterol in the endolysosomal compartment of NPC1-mutant NSCs we grew cells in the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 24 h prior to liposome treatment. We initially titrated the FBS concentration and established an optimal 2.5% concentration, since higher concentrations of FBS significantly diminished cell viability (not shown). In contrast to WT cells and in agreement with previous studies (31Yu D. Swaroop M. Wang M. Baxa U. Yang R. Yan Y. Coksaygan T. DeTolla L. Marugan J.J. Austin C.P. McKew J.C. Gong D.W. Zheng W. Niemann-Pick disease type C: Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal cells for modeling neural disease and evaluating drug efficacy.J. Biomol. Screen. 2014; 19: 1164-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), NPC1 NSCs accumulated LDL cholesterol in the LE/LY compartment (Fig. 1A). After 24 h culturing in the presence of FBS, cells were treated with 100 mol% PG or phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes for an additional 24 or 48 h. Unesterified cholesterol levels in NPC1 mutant fibroblasts and NPC1 KO HeLa cells were determined quantitatively using image analysis of the fluorescent antibiotic filipin or the fluorescently labeled cytolysin PFO∗, as previously described (25McCauliff L.A. Langan A. Li R. Ilnytska O. Bose D. Waghalter M. Lai K. Kahn P.C. Storch J. Intracellular cholesterol trafficking is dependent upon NPC2 interaction with lysobisphosphatidic acid.Elife. 2019; 8e50832Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32Li J. Lee P.L. Pfeffer S.R. Quantitative measurement of cholesterol in cell populations using flow cytometry and fluorescent perfringolysin O.Methods Mol. Biol. 2017; 1583: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). PG treatment resulted in significant correction of the NPC1 phenotype in all three cellular model systems at 24 and 48 h, as observed by reduced filipin and PFO∗ intensities (Fig. 1, A and B and Fig. S1A). In marked contrast, supplementation with PC had no effect on LE/LY cholesterol storage at 24 h and showed a small reduction at 48 h, indicating that the effect of cholesterol clearance is PG specific. LC-MS analysis of phospholipids in PG-treated NPC1-deficient fibroblasts at 12, 24, and 48 h post treatment revealed remarkable increases of up to 50-fold in both PG and LBPA levels in NPC1 cells (Fig. 1C). Phosphatidylinositol (PI) and N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine increased approximately 2.5-fold, and other phospholipid levels, except acyl-PG, were unchanged (Fig. S1B). PG levels declined over time, whereas LBPA levels increased, further indicating conversion of PG to LBPA. The gradual declines in N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine and acyl-PG suggest they may be synthetic intermediates, although this remains to be determined. Of interest, the analysis of LBPA molecular species in NPC1 fibroblasts treated with di-oleoyl PG revealed not only an expected increase in di-oleoyl LBPA but also marked, up to 25-fold increases in LBPA species incorporating polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), e.g., 18:1,22:6-LBPA (oleoyl, docosahexaenoyl (DHA)-LBPA) (40:7 in Fig. 1D), relative to untreated cells. We noted that NPC1-deficient fibroblasts supplemented with PC showed an approximately 2-fold increase in PG, and LBPA levels were elevated by approximately 50% (Fig. S1C). Exogenous PC can serve as a substrate for PG synthesis via a transphosphatidylation reaction (33Piazza G.J. Marmer W.N. Conversion of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylglycerol with phospholipase D and glycerol.J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 2007; 84: 645-651Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar); thus, these relatively small increases in PG and LBPA might explain the slight cholesterol reduction in all PC-treated NPC1 cellular models after 48 h (Fig. 1, A and B and Fig. S1A). Overall, these results indicate a specific effect of PG/LBPA enrichment on cholesterol clearance. PG is also the precursor of another atypical phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL) (34Stanacev N.Z. Chang Y.Y. Kennedy E.P. Biosynthesis of cardiolipin in Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3018-3019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LC-MS analysis of CL levels in NPC1-deficient cells revealed no change over 48 h of PG treatment (Fig. S1D), indicating that the exogenous PG is not utilized for CL biosynthesis, but rather for LBPA biosynthesis, in NPC1 cells. This may be due to introduction of the precursor to the endosomal vesicle system, separate from subcellular sties of CL generation, as well as the understanding that CL concentrations are tightly controlled by its abundance in mitochondria (35Schlame M. Greenberg M.L. Biosynthesis, remodeling and turnover of mitochondrial cardiolipin.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Biol. Lipids. 2017; 1862: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Of importance, PG supplementation does not affect cell viability in NPC1-deficient cells even when added for up to 6 days (Fig. S1E). We next investigated whether PG treatment in NPC1-deficient fibroblasts led to endolysosomal cholesterol redistribution to the ER compartment. Increased cholesterol levels in the ER repress processing of the master transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) into its mature, transcriptionally active form ((M)SREBP2) (36Eberle D. Hegarty B. Bossard P. Ferre P. Foufelle F. SREBP transcription factors: Master regulators of lipid homeostasis.Biochimie. 2004; 86: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Of interest, despite significant LE/LY cholesterol reduction at 24 h of PG treatment, the level of (M)SREBP2 was not changed (Fig. 1E), implying that cholesterol did not reach the regulatory pool in the ER at this time point. By contrast, at 48 h following PG treatment the (M)SREBP2 level was decreased by approximately 50%, suggesting delivery of cholesterol to the ER. Egress of cholesterol from the LE/LY is reportedly followed by its residence in the PM (11Pfisterer S.G. Peranen J. Ikonen E. LDL-cholesterol transport to the endoplasmic reticulum: Current concepts.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2016; 27: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 37Infante R.E. Radhakrishnan A. Continuous transport of a small fraction of plasma membrane cholesterol to endoplasmic reticulum regulates total cellular cholesterol.Elife. 2017; 6e25466Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To identify cholesterol at the cytoplasmic leaflet of the PM in live cells, we used a perfringolysin O (PFO)-derived cholesterol-binding probe, mCherry-D4D434S mutant (named D4H) (38Maekawa M. Fairn G.D. Complementary probes reveal that phosphatidylserine is required for the proper transbilayer distribution of cholesterol.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128: 1422-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In WT fibroblasts we found that the mCherry-D4H reporter was mainly localized to the cytosolic leaflet of the PM and to recycling endosomes enriched in cholesterol (Fig. 1F). NPC1-deficient cells have been shown to have a reduced amount of cholesterol in the PM (39Wojtanik K.M. Liscum L. The transport of low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol to the plasma membrane is defective in NPC1 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14850-14856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we found that, in untreated NPC1 cells, the D4H reporter was more heavily localized to the abundant perinuclear cholesterol-enriched endolysosomal compartments than to the PM, with only ∼25% of cells expressing the D4H reporter showing both perinuclear and peripheral PM signal (Fig. 1F). In contrast, we observed that, at 24 h of PG treatment in NPC1-deficient cells, D4H was localized to the PM in ∼50% of cells, where it colocalized with a PLCδ-PH domain fused to GFP (PHPLCδ-GFP), a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) probe and PM marker (40Várnai P.

Together these data suggest the trafficking of endolysosomal cholesterol to the PM at earlier (≤ 24 h) time points and to the ER at later (>24 h) time points of PG treatment, indicating the restoration of normal cholesterol trafficking and distribution. Defective autophagy is implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative and lysosomal storage diseases including NPC1, where impaired autophagosome–lysosome (AP-LY) fusion has been reported (13Dai S.

Treatment with PG gradually reduced the levels of LC3-II and p62 over 24 to 48 h, suggesting an induction of autophagic protein degradation in NPC1-mutant fibroblasts and NPC1 KO HeLa cells (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2A). The PG-induced p62 and LC3-II protein reduction was abrogated in the presence of Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) (Fig. 2C), an inhibitor of LY function and of the late phase of autophagy (43Klionsky D.J.

Both the number and size of p62- and LC3-positive puncta (shown in insets), indicative of AP, were consistently reduced in PG-treated NPC1 fibroblasts, NPC1-mutant NSC cells, and NPC1 KO HeLa cells (Fig. 2, D and E and Fig. S2, B–D).

Cellular pyruvate is an essential metabolite that resides at the intersection of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Pyruvate can be oxidized by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) to form acetyl-CoA entering the citric acid (TCA) cycle, further undergoing OxPhos to generate ATP. Alternatively, pyruvate fuels anaplerosis by replenishing oxaloacetate in the TCA cycle, and conversion of pyruvate to alanine facilitates syntheses of various amino acids. In the process of glucose fermentation (anaerobic glycolysis), pyruvate is reduced to lactate via cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), coupled with NADH to NAD+ oxidation. Pyruvate-to-lactate conversion is an important pathway for ATP generation and homeostasis under physiologically low pO2 (anaerobic glycolysis of exercising muscle) and also supports the reprogramed cancer metabolic state of aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect (1Liberti M.V. Locasale J.W. The Warburg effect: How does it benefit cancer cells?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41: 211-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). The physiological concentration of pyruvate in plasma ranges from 30 to 260 μM (2Sattler U.G. Walenta S. Mueller-Klieser W. A bioluminescence technique for quantitative and structure-associated imaging of pyruvate.Lab. Invest. 2007; 87: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, two inherited diseases of mitochondrial metabolism impact extracellular (plasma) pyruvate concentration: pyruvate carboxylase (PC) deficiency and PDH deficiency. PC deficiency is a rare genetic disorder present at birth characterized by developmental delay, recurrent seizures, and failure to produce TCA intermediates and neurotransmitters important for brain function (3Wang Dong De Vivo Darryl Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency.in: GeneReviews® [Internet]. University of Washington, Seattle, WA2009: 1993-2020Google Scholar). PC deficiency is diagnosed by physical symptoms and laboratory analysis, including high plasma levels of pyruvate, ammonia, lactate, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. The relationships between elevated pyruvate levels and tissue-selective toxicity remain underexplored. In PDH deficiency, wherein pyruvate fails to enter the TCA cycle, systemic increases of lactate result in lactic acidosis with potential profound brain stem and ganglia damage (4Marsac C. Benelli C. Desguerre I. Diry M. Fouque F. De Meirleir L. Ponsot G. Seneca S. Poggi F. Saudubray J.M. Zabot M.T. Fontan D. Lissens W. Biochemical and genetic studies of four patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha deficiency.Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As an alternative energy source, pyruvate therapy can be used to treat patients in whom OxPhos is impaired and an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio limits the activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (5Fujii T.

The administered exogenous pyruvate is transported into cells, mediated by monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1) (6Rao Y. Gammon S. Zacharias N.M. Liu T. Salzillo T. Xi Y. Wang J. Bhattacharya P. Piwnica-Worms D. Hyperpolarized [1-(13)C]pyruvate-to-[1-(13)C]lactate conversion is rate-limited by monocarboxylate transporter-1 in the plasma membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therein, intracellular pyruvate can then be catalyzed by LDH, producing lactate and NAD+, thereby restoring GAPDH activity. Although highly concentrated pyruvate (0.5–1.0 g/kg/day) is administered to some patients with benefit, the multiorgan metabolic effects of exogenous pyruvate therapy remain under evaluation. In this context, isotope-labeled pyruvate is a useful biochemical tool compound commonly used in tracing experiments to examine metabolism both in vitro and in humans in vivo (8Chokkathukalam A.

Infused [1-13C]pyruvate is the most well-characterized exogenous hyperpolarization probe for metabolic analysis and clinical translation, wherein intracellular [1-13C]pyruvate is converted to [1-13C]lactate via cytoplasmic LDH, which can be directly monitored by MRSI in living animals and humans (21Kurhanewicz J.

Because [1-13C]pyruvate carries a physiological negative charge, transmembrane influx of systemically administered [1-13C]pyruvate from extracellular spaces into intracellular spaces is transporter mediated primarily by MCT1 (6Rao Y.

The conversion of [1-13C]pyruvate to [1-13C]lactate has been used conventionally to inform the state of glycolytic flux of various tumors as well as to assess LDH activity either qualitatively or quantitatively. However, recent data provide a reinterpretation of MRSI signals in terms of MCT1 signatures as the rate-limiting step, pointing to new uses of the technology as a cancer prognostic marker in vivo (6Rao Y.

However, the biochemical mechanism(s) of the observed phenotypes are not entirely elucidated. Hence, further analysis in vivo is desired to enhance our understanding of potential metabolic perturbations induced by elevated plasma pyruvate and, more specifically, bolus infusions of hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate during hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate MRSI studies. With this in mind, by evaluating LDH enzyme kinetics quantitatively in vitro and characterizing the effect of concentrated exogenous pyruvate on lactate production semiquantitatively in cellulo using genetic and pharmacologic tools across well-defined cell lines, we found that biomedically relevant millimolar concentrations of pyruvate, typically used during pyruvate therapy and [1-13C]pyruvate MRSI, induced decreased lactate production in live cells, mechanistically related to substrate inhibition of LDH. Furthermore, because intracellular pyruvate accumulation is dependent on pyruvate influx (6Rao Y. Gammon S. Zacharias N.M. Liu T. Salzillo T. Xi Y. Wang J. Bhattacharya P. Piwnica-Worms D.

LDH is a tetrameric enzyme comprising LDHA (M subunit primarily expressed in skeletal muscle) and LDHB (H subunit primarily expressed in the heart) (27Doherty J.R. Cleveland J.L.

Rather longstanding and perhaps forgotten metabolic studies have suggested that high concentrations of pyruvate can induce substrate inhibition of LDH extracted from various cells, including cardiac cells, erythrocytes, and muscle cells (32Gutfreund H.

Evidence for the competitive substrate inhibition.Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we first validated a classic coupled-enzyme kinetic assay using commercially available bovine heart LDH, purified human recombinant LDHA, and recombinant LDHB in response to a broad range of pyruvate concentrations. Because initial velocities were evaluated as a change (decrease) in NADH absorbance, which was coupled with pyruvate-to-lactate conversion, it was important to affirm the specificity of initial velocity signals. Indeed, in the absence of LDH enzyme or pyruvate, initial velocities (changes in NADH absorbance) were approximately zero (Fig. 1A). As a further control, pyruvate-induced shifts in buffer pH were negligible across all pyruvate concentrations (±0.1) (Fig. 1B), and thus, any observed pyruvate-induced LDH enzyme effects could not be attributed to pH changes. Strong biphasic pyruvate activation kinetics and substrate inhibition of LDH in response to increasing pyruvate concentrations was observed regardless of LDH isoform or source (R2 bovine LDH = 0.988, R2 LDHA = 0.966, and R2 LDHB = 0.925) (Fig. 1A). Maximal initial velocities of the activation curve fits (upstrokes), peak initial velocities of the biphasic curve fits, pyruvate concentrations at peak initial velocities, and apparent Km and Ki values are summarized in Table 1. Of note, when initial velocities of bovine heart LDH enzyme, recombinant LDHA, and recombinant LDHB were normalized to their corresponding peak velocities, the biphasic substrate inhibition curve of LDHB closely align with the curve of bovine heart LDH, whereas the biphasic substrate inhibition curve of LDHA was right-shifted (Fig. 1C). Thus, the precision of the pyruvate titration curves indicated that bovine heart LDH primarily comprised LDHB, affirming the anticipated results (28Valvona C.J. Fillmore H.L. Nunn P.B.

All experiments were done in triplicate (technical replicates); n = 3, independent experiments (biological replicates); mean values with standard errors. Next, to extend the kinetic analysis to tumor cells, LDH activity was determined in extracts from a multi-cell-line panel comprising four well-established human cancer cell lines and one normal cell line: pancreatic cancer cell lines (Panc03.27 and Mia Paca2), a pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer cell line (QGP1), a triple-negative breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231), and an immortalized normal pancreatic epithelial cell line (HPNE). LDH in cell protein extracts, regardless of whether extracts were from cancer or normal cells, demonstrated biphasic pyruvate activation kinetics and substrate inhibition patterns highly similar to commercially available recombinant LDH enzymes (R2 Panc03.27 = 0.961, R2 Mia Paca2 = 0.976, R2 QGP1 = 0.976, R2 MDA-MB-231 = 0.917, and R2 HPNE = 0.978) (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, in the absence of exogenous pyruvate, initial velocity signals were near zero, affirming the LDH specificity of the assay. The highest peak initial velocities of the biphasic curve fits were measured in extracts from MDA-MB-231 cells, then HPNE cells, followed by Panc03.27 and QGP1 cells, and the lowest in Mia Paca-2 cells (Fig. 1D). Pyruvate concentrations at peak initial velocities across all tested cell lines occurred between 0.3 and 0.7 mM pyruvate. Maximal initial velocities of the activation curve fits (upstrokes), peak initial velocities of the biphasic curve fits, pyruvate concentrations at peak initial velocities, and apparent Km and Ki values are summarized in Table 2. Both the Km of activation kinetics and the Ki of substrate inhibition kinetics were highly clustered but the highest in LDH from Mia Paca-2 cells, slightly lower in MDA-MB-231 cells, intermediate in HPNE and QGP1 cells, and the lowest in Panc03.27 cells (Fig. 1E). Across the panel, evidence for inhibition of LDH enzyme activity occurred when pyruvate concentrations were higher than 0.7 mM. The relative abundance of LDHA and LDHB mRNA was determined using real-time quantitative PCR (Fig. 1F), and LDHB/LDHA mRNA ratios for each cell line were calculated (Fig. 1G). Of interest, the LDHB/LDHA mRNA ratios were significantly inversely correlated with Cmax, the pyruvate concentration at the corresponding peak velocity (Vpeak), across the cell panel (r = −0.985, p = 0.002) (Fig. 1H), suggesting that the measured pyruvate-dependent Cmax could be indicative of the LDHA and LDHB heterotetrameric subunit composition within each cell line. Overall, these results indicated that cellular LDH activity in vitro was substrate inhibited uniformly by high concentrations of pyruvate regardless of cell source of enzyme.Table 2Effect of pyruvate on LDH enzyme kinetics in cell extractsLDH enzymesVmaz (ΔAbs/s∗10−3/μg protein)Vpeak (ΔAbs/s∗10−3/μg protein)Cmax (mM)Km (mM)Ki (mM)Panc03.272.00 ± 0.071.560.330.05 ± 0.002.33 ± 0.21Mia Paca-20.88 ± 0.030.660.690.11 ± 0.014.26 ± 0.32QGP11.85 ± 0.051.420.510.08 ± 0.013.42 ± 0.25MDA-MB-2312.98 ± 0.172.200.600.10 ± 0.023.39 ± 0.50HPNE2.71 ± 0.081.980.480.09 ± 0.012.67 ± 0.20Abbreviation: LDH, lactate dehydrogenase.Summary of maximal initial velocities from activation curve fits (Vmax), peak initial velocities of the biphasic curve fits (Vpeak), pyruvate concentrations at peak velocities of the biphasic curve fits (Cmax), and apparent Km and Ki values of LDH in extracts from Panc03.27, Mia Paca2, QGP1, MDA-MB-231, and HPNE cells.

The extracellular N terminus of GPR133 is thought to be autoproteolytically cleaved into N-terminal and C- terminal fragments (NTF and CTF, respectively). However, the role of this cleavage in receptor activation remains unclear. Here, we used subcellular fractionation and immunoprecipitation approaches to show that the WT GPR133 receptor is cleaved shortly after protein synthesis and generates significantly more canonical signaling than an uncleavable point mutant GPR133 (H543R) in patient-derived GBM cultures and HEK293T cells. After cleavage, the resulting NTF and CTF remain noncovalently bound to each other until the receptor is trafficked to the plasma membrane, where we demonstrated NTF–CTF dissociation occurs. Using a fusion of the CTF of GPR133 and the N terminus of thrombin-activated human protease-activated receptor 1 as a controllable proxy system to test the effect of intramolecular cleavage and dissociation, we also showed that thrombin-induced cleavage and shedding of the human protease-activated receptor 1 NTF increased intracellular cAMP levels. These results support a model wherein dissociation of the NTF from the CTF at the plasma membrane promotes GPR133 activation and downstream signaling. These findings add depth to our understanding of the molecular life cycle and mechanism of action of GPR133 and provide critical insights that will inform therapeutic targeting of GPR133 in GBM.

The adhesion family of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) has attracted increasing interest in the recent years for essential functions in health and disease (1Morgan R.K. Anderson G.R. Arac D.

The large extracellular N termini of adhesion GPCRs contain a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing domain, which is thought to catalyze autoproteolytic cleavage at the GPCR proteolysis site (GPS) marked by the tripeptide sequence H-L/I-∗-S/T (∗ denotes the cleavage site) (3Lin H.H.

After this intramolecular cleavage, adhesion GPCRs are generally believed to exist as noncovalently bound heterodimers of their extracellular N-terminal fragment (NTF) and transmembrane-spanning C-terminal fragment (CTF) (5Gray J.X.

The recent demonstration of a tethered internal agonist, also known as the Stachel sequence, immediately C-terminal to the GPS, has given rise to the hypothesis that NTF–CTF dissociation facilitates the conformational changes needed for the Stachel sequence to initiate receptor activation (7Liebscher I.

However, the mechanism of receptor activation mediated by autoproteolytic cleavage and NTF–CTF dissociation is not generalizable to all members of the adhesion GPCR family. Indeed, several adhesion GPCRs have not yet been observed to undergo intramolecular cleavage, and cleavage is not necessarily required for their activity (2Langenhan T.

These observations emphasize the need to study mechanisms of activation for adhesion GPCRs on an individual basis and in physiologically relevant biological contexts.

In heterologous expression systems, N-terminally truncated CTF constructs of GPR133 generate significantly more G protein–mediated signaling than the full-length receptor (7Liebscher I. Schon J. Petersen S.C. Fischer L. Auerbach N. Demberg L.M. Mogha A. Coster M. Simon K.U. Rothemund S. Monk K.R. Schoneberg T.

Nonetheless, there has not been any prior study of the extent of GPR133 cleavage or the NTF–CTF association. Here, we demonstrate that GPR133 is almost entirely cleaved in patient-derived GBM cells and that cleaved GPR133 has a higher basal activity than an uncleavable GPR133 point mutant. While the cleaved CTF and NTF remain noncovalently bound to each other within the secretory pathway, we demonstrate that the NTF dissociates from the CTF once reaching the plasma membrane (PM). Using a fusion protein of the N terminus from human protease-activated receptor 1 (hPAR1) receptor and the CTF of GPR133, we show that acutely induced dissociation of the NTF and thus liberation of the CTF at the PM increases canonical signaling of GPR133. These findings favor an NTF–CTF dissociation model for activation of GPR133 signaling. Previous reports suggested canonical signaling by GPR133 is mediated via coupling to GαS, resulting in an increase of intracellular cAMP (11Bohnekamp J. Schoneberg T. Cell adhesion receptor GPR133 couples to Gs protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 41912-41916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We independently confirmed that expression of GPR133 in HEK293T cells is associated with robust increase in cAMP levels as detected by a cAMP response element–Luciferase reporter, but not other known GPCR signaling pathways (Fig. 1A). To test whether intramolecular cleavage has implications for canonical signaling, we generated an H543R mutant GPR133 carrying a point mutation at the −2 residue of the GPS cleavage site (11Bohnekamp J.

We used homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assays to measure the cAMP levels produced by the cleaved WT and uncleaved mutant receptor in HEK293T cells. While overexpression of either receptor variant significantly raised cAMP levels above background, indicating a high baseline signaling activity, overexpression of the uncleavable H543R mutant GPR133 increased cAMP levels only to ∼60% of the cAMP levels obtained with WT GPR133 (Fig. 1C). This difference in signaling intensity could not be explained by differences in expression levels of the constructs as assessed by ELISA (Fig. 1D). Our previous work has demonstrated that GPR133 is expressed in human GBM (19Frenster J.D. Kader M. Kamen S. Sun J. Chiriboga L. Serrano J. Bready D. Golub D. Ravn-Boess N. Stephan G. Chi A.S.

We thus sought to confirm our findings in the disease-relevant context of patient-derived GBM cultures and obtained similar results (Fig. 1, F and G). These findings suggest that autoproteolytic cleavage might promote receptor activation.

Affinity-purifying the receptor fragments to reduce nonspecific background staining confirmed these distinct CTF and NTF bands with increased clarity (Fig. 1E; red arrows mark the CTF, and green arrows mark the NTF). For the WT receptor, we also identified a faint band at 110 kDa (blue arrow), which we hypothesized to represent the uncleaved WT GPR133, as well as a faint band around 48 kDa (red arrow), possibly a dimer of the CTF (Fig. 1E and Fig. S1C). In contrast, the H543R-mutated GPR133 was detected as a single full-length band (∼110 kDa, yellow arrow), consistent with its cleavage deficiency (Fig. 1E and Fig. S1C; yellow arrows).

Sin. 2017; 38: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), we next interrogated GPR133 cleavage in our patient-derived GBM cultures. Indeed, the same cleavage pattern was confirmed in four separate patient-derived GBM cell cultures (affinity-purified receptor fragments in Fig. 1H and whole-cell lysates in Fig. S1D). It is important to comment on the discrepancies between expected and observed molecular weights (MWs) of the uncleaved receptor, NTF, and CTF. The expected MW of the uncleaved receptor without the signal peptide is 93 kDa, whereas those of the NTF and CTF are expected to be 57 kDa (without the signal peptide) and 36 kDa, respectively. The shifts in the observed MW of the uncleaved receptor and NTF are due to glycosylation, as demonstrated later in the article. The shift in the MW of the CTF from 36 kDa (expected) to 25 kDa (observed) is likely explained by increased SDS loading on the helical hydrophobic transmembrane segments of the CTF, as previously reported for other transmembrane proteins (21Rath A. Glibowicka M. Nadeau V.G. Chen G. Deber C.M. Detergent binding explains anomalous SDS-PAGE migration of membrane proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106: 1760-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Overall, these findings suggest that GPR133 is almost entirely cleaved in human GBM and HEK293T cells. To understand mechanisms underlying the increased signaling generated by WT GPR133 compared with the uncleavable mutant receptor, we first analyzed their trafficking to the PM through the secretory pathway. Using confocal microscopy and indirect immunofluorescent staining under nonpermeabilizing conditions, we detected both the WT and the H543R-mutated GPR133 at the PM of cells (Fig. 2Ai–iii and Fig. S2A). Similarly, under permeabilizing conditions, the WT and the H543R-mutated GPR133 demonstrated analogous staining patterns in both intracellular organelles of the secretory pathway, as well as at the PM (Fig. 2Bi–iii and Fig. S2B). To confirm these findings biochemically, we used subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis to separately interrogate three fractions enriched for (1) cytosol, with some endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contamination, (2) nucleus, ER, and the Golgi apparatus (Nuc/ER/Golgi), and (3) the PM. It is noteworthy that while the first two fractions showed enrichment for distinct subcellular compartments/organelles, the PM fraction was highly specific, as demonstrated by absence of staining for any non-PM compartment markers by Western blot (Fig. 2E). Both the cleaved NTF and CTF of the WT receptor, as well as the uncleaved H543R mutant, were prominently detected in the PM fraction (Fig. 2, C and D, red arrowheads), consistent with our microscopy data. Collectively, these findings suggested that intramolecular cleavage of GPR133 is not required for subcellular trafficking to the PM and that the observed difference in signaling intensities between the cleaved and uncleaved GPR133 variants is not likely to be caused by subcellular trafficking defects. While interrogating the distribution of GPR133 across the subcellular fractions, it became apparent that the cleaved WT GPR133 NTF and the H543R full-length GPR133 undergo an MW shift from lower weight bands in the fractions containing proteins from the early secretory pathway toward higher MW bands in the PM fraction (Fig. 2, C and D, green and red arrowheads, respectively). Because there are nine N-linked glycosylation sites predicted within the NTF (Fig. S1A), we hypothesized that these observed size shifts are due to different extents of glycosylation as the receptor matures through the secretory pathway. To test this hypothesis, we treated the different subcellular fractions with an enzymatic deglycosylation mix (containing PNGase F, O-glycosidase, α2-3,6,8,9 neuraminidase A, β1-4 galactosidase S, and β-N-acetylhexosaminidasef). Indeed, upon deglycosylation, the different MW isoforms of cleaved WT NTF and full-length H543R GPR133 shifted to the same predicted MW independent of their subcellular fraction of origin (Fig. 3A, green, red, and blue arrowheads demarking immaturely glycosylated, maturely glycosylated, and deglycosylated bands, respectively; deglycosylated whole-cell lysates are shown in Fig. S3A for reference), confirming that these bands represent the same protein with different extents of glycosylation. When staining WT GPR133 using the anti-CTF antibody, we detected a band in the Nuc/ER/Golgi fraction shifting from ∼100 kDa to ∼70 kDa upon deglycosylation (Fig. 3Ai, green and blue arrowheads, furthest left). This pattern mimics the immaturely glycosylated uncleaved H543R GPR133, leading to our hypothesis that this band is the low-abundance uncleaved form of WT GPR133 we had previously observed in Western blots from whole-cell lysates (Fig. 1, E and H, and Fig. S1, C and D). The faster-than-expected mobility of this uncleaved deglycosylated form likely results from increased SDS binding on the helical transmembrane segments of the receptor (21Rath A. Glibowicka M. Nadeau V.G. Chen G. Deber C.M. Detergent binding explains anomalous SDS-PAGE migration of membrane proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106: 1760-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). To test whether this uncleaved and immaturely glycosylated form of WT GPR133 is a stable form of the receptor or a transient state during receptor maturation, we blocked protein synthesis with cycloheximide. Protein synthesis block indeed abolished this uncleaved form of GPR133, supporting the hypothesis that the uncleaved WT GPR133 is a short-lived transition state (Fig. 3B, green and blue arrowheads). To determine whether this short-lived full-length WT GPR133 is cleaved directly after synthesis in the ER, or later in the Golgi, we treated cells with brefeldin A (BFA), which interrupts ER-to-Golgi transport. The effectiveness of BFA to prevent transport along the secretory pathway was confirmed by confocal microscopy (Fig. S3B). BFA treatment did not lead to an accumulation of the uncleaved WT GPR133 isoform (Fig. 3Ci, green arrowheads), suggesting cleavage happens immediately after protein synthesis. However, BFA treatment did result in the elimination of maturely glycosylated NTF in the Nuc/ER/Golgi fraction 14 h after its addition to the medium (Fig. 3Cii, red arrowheads). Finally, we treated the subcellular fractions with endoglycosidase H (EndoH), which removes the immature high mannose glycosylation of proteins within the ER but not mature glycosylation of proteins that have reached the Golgi. Indeed, we observed that the uncleaved WT GPR133 band was sensitive to EndoH-mediated deglycosylation without an additional deglycosylation effect conferred by a complete deglycosylation mix containing PNGase, suggesting that it represents an immaturely glycosylated protein localizing to the ER (Fig. 3D). These data suggest a model in which newly synthesized WT GPR133 carrying immature glycosylation gets intramolecularly cleaved within the ER before trafficking to the Golgi, where it acquires mature glycosylation. WT GPR133 reaches the PM as a fully cleaved and maturely glycosylated protein. To investigate whether the cleaved GPR133 CTF and NTF remain noncovalently bound to each other, we created GPR133 constructs carrying either C-terminal or N-terminal Twin-Strep-tags for affinity purification (Fig. 4A). When purifying the cleaved receptor from whole-cell lysates, identical stoichiometries of the CTF and NTF were eluted, independent of whether they are purified using the N-terminal or C-terminal affinity tag (Fig. 4B). While this finding suggested that the NTF and CTF remain noncovalently associated at the whole-cell level, we proceeded to dissect whether this association varied depending on the location of GPR133 along the secretory pathway. To this end, we quantified the relative distribution of each receptor fragment (WT CTF, WT NTF, H543R full length as detected with the CTF antibody, H543R full length as detected with the NTF antibody) across the three subcellular fractions mentioned above (Fig. 4C). The subcellular distribution did not differ between the cleaved WT CTF and the uncleaved H543R mutant using either the C-terminal or N-terminal antibody, supporting the previous observation that cleavage does not affect the trafficking of the receptor’s transmembrane segment. However, the cleaved WT NTF was significantly underrepresented at the PM when compared with the WT CTF or the H543R uncleaved receptor (Fig. 4C). We note that, although the WT NTF appears to be overrepresented in the Nuc/ER/Golgi fraction compared with the WT CTF, this is likely a mathematical artifact arising from reduced representation of the WT NTF in the PM fraction. This finding suggested that either the cleaved NTF traffics within the cells independently of the CTF or, more likely, the NTF dissociates from the CTF at the PM and is thus less abundant in that fraction. To test these two models, we repeated the purification of the receptor using its C-terminal affinity tag and compared the Nuc/ER/Golgi fraction against the PM fraction as input. We detected a significantly lower NTF-to-CTF ratio at the PM than the Nuc/ER/Golgi fraction (Fig. 4Di–iii). Furthermore, we were able to purify and detect the soluble NTF from precleared cell culture supernatants, while not detecting any associated CTFs (Fig. 4E and Fig. S4, A and B). These findings suggested that, while the cleaved NTF and CTF are noncovalently bound in the secretory pathway, they do partially dissociate at the PM. To gather additional evidence for such NTF–CTF dissociation at the PM, we assayed protein decay of the two fragments after blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide in HEK293T cells overexpressing either the cleaved WT or uncleaved H543R mutant receptor. Whole-cell lysates of different cycloheximide chase time points were analyzed by Western blot using our CTF- and NTF-targeting antibodies, and intensities were plotted as a function of time (Fig. 4Fi and ii and Fig. S4C). No significant difference was detected between the decay curves and half-life times of uncleaved H543R GPR133 and the WT CTF, indicating that the above described signaling intensity differences were not caused by differences in protein stability. However, the cleaved WT GPR133 NTF decayed at a significantly faster rate than the WT CTF. Although these da"

Insulin resistance can result in elevated rates of insulin secretion and hyperinsulinemia. If unresolved, pancreatic beta cell failure can lead to loss of beta cell mass via cell death or dedifferentiation (1Donath M.Y. Ehses J.A. Maedler K. Schumann D.M. Ellingsgaard H. Eppler E.

Insulin sensitizers are an attractive therapeutic strategy as they not only target the core defective insulin signaling pathways but can also reduce this stress on beta cells and preserve beta cell mass (3Campbell I.W.

However, clinical use of the main class of insulin sensitizers, the thiazolidinediones (TZDs), is limited owing to side effects such as weight gain, edema, bone loss, and bladder cancer risk. These side effects are thought to be due to agonism of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ).

The purpose of this current study was to investigate whether combining the PPARγ-sparing TZD MSDC-0602K and the GLP-1RA liraglutide would better improve mouse models of diabetes and NASH. Beginning at 9 weeks of age, db/db mice were treated with MSDC-0602K, liraglutide, combination, or both vehicle solutions. 0602K treatment caused slight weight gain and Lira treatment caused slight weight loss compared with vehicle-treated db/db mice (Fig. 1A). Mice treated with 0602K+Lira combination displayed slight weight gain similar to mice treated with 0602K alone (Fig. 1A). Blood glucose was monitored weekly and was completely corrected to db/+ levels by 0602K or 0602K+Lira treatments, whereas Lira treatment more modestly improved glycemia (Fig. 1B). Both drugs individually improved glucose tolerance compared with vehicle-treated db/db mice, and the 0602K+Lira combination improved glucose tolerance beyond even lean db/+ mouse levels (Fig. 1, C and D). At sacrifice, 4-h fasted blood glucose levels were completely corrected by 0602K or 0602K+Lira (Fig. 1E). Plasma fructosamine levels supported the weekly glucose measurements indicating that Lira modestly improved glycemia, whereas 0602K or 0602K+Lira completely corrected glycemia (Fig. 1F). These results indicate that, although 0602K alone is able to correct glycemia, the combination of 0602K+Lira better improves glucose tolerance in db/db mice. Epididymal white adipose tissue weights were unaffected by drug treatment (Fig. 2A), but 0602K trended to increase inguinal subcutaneous white adipose tissue and significantly increased brown adipose tissue weight whether provided alone or in combination with Lira (Fig. 2, B and C). Increased liver weights in db/db mice were not altered by drug treatment (Fig. 2D), yet hepatic triacylglyceride (TAG) was nearly significantly reduced by 0602K+Lira (Fig. 2E). Hepatic glycogen levels were also increased in db/db mice and were completely normalized by either 0602K or 0602K+Lira (Fig. 2F). Thus, 0602K increased adiposity and corrected hepatic glycogen levels whether given alone or in combination with Lira. Vehicle-treated db/db mice were hyperinsulinemic, and 0602K decreased these plasma insulin concentrations (Fig. 3A). In contrast, Lira treatment further increased plasma insulin, yet mice treated with 0602K+Lira displayed reduced insulin similar to 0602K-treated animals (Fig. 3A). To resolve whether the changes in insulinemia were due to insulin secretion versus insulin clearance, we measured plasma C-peptide concentrations, which were strongly elevated in vehicle-treated db/db mice. Although Lira further increased C-peptide concentrations, 0602K or 0602K+Lira-treated mice displayed reduced C-peptide (Fig. 3B). An increased insulin/C-peptide ratio in 0602K-treated mice suggests that 0602K more strongly reduced insulin secretion versus increased clearance (Fig. 3C). Plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs), TAG, and cholesterol were all increased in vehicle-treated db/db mice, and reduced by 0602K, Lira, or 0602K+Lira treatments (Fig. 3, D–F). These results suggest that 0602K reduces hyperinsulinemia by reducing insulin secretion even in combination with liraglutide, yet all treatments were able to improve plasma lipids. A subset of mice was subjected to an i.p. insulin tolerance test, which when normalized to starting glucose levels, clearly indicated that only db/+ lean mice, or mice treated with 0602K, had a significant decrease in blood glucose from insulin (Fig. 4, A and B). Subsequently, mice were injected with insulin i.p. and sacrificed after 10 min to assess insulin signaling. Livers from db/+ mice displayed a robust phosphorylation of AKT upon insulin injection, which was severely blunted in vehicle-treated db/db livers (Fig. 4, C and D). Although 0602K treatment partially restored the insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation in the liver, liraglutide treatment resulted in no improvement (Fig. 4, C and D). These improvements in insulin sensitivity led to improved pancreatic islet insulin content, which was very low in vehicle-treated db/db mice (Fig. 4, E and F). Altogether, these results suggest that 0602K treatment with or without liraglutide improves insulin sensitivity and partially restores islet insulin content. We next wanted to test whether 0602K was directly inhibiting insulin secretion. This is particularly intriguing as 0602K inhibits the MPC (9Divakaruni A.S. Wiley S.E. Rogers G.W. Andreyev A.Y.

Metab. 2016; 5: 602-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In a subset of mice, plasma insulin was measured before and 30 min after an i.p. injection of glucose. 0602K- or 0602K+Lira-treated mice displayed significantly lower starting insulinemia; however, these mice had ∼60% increases in insulin concentrations after glucose injection compared with 7% increase in vehicle-treated db/db mice (Fig. 5A). Although these results suggest that 0602K treatment does not directly inhibit insulin secretion, we also tested this in isolated wildtype mouse islets, which also showed no effect of 0602K treatment on GSIS (Fig. 5B). Of interest, 0602K does appear to inhibit the MPC in cultured Beta-TC6 insulinoma cells, as 0602K or the MPC inhibitor UK-5099 were both able to reduce glucose/pyruvate-stimulated oxygen consumption and increase glycolysis (Fig. 5, C and D). Therefore, despite inhibiting the beta cell MPC and mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism, 0602K does not acutely inhibit insulin secretion. Finally, a single gavaged dose of 0602K 16 h prior was able to reduce plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations in diet-induced obese fl/fl (wildtype) and rat insulin promoter (RIP) Cre-driven beta cell MPC2 knockout mice (Fig. 5, E–G). Thus, insulin secretion was reduced by 0602K even when the molecular target of 0602K was not expressed in the pancreatic beta cells. Altogether, these results suggest that 0602K does not acutely inhibit insulin secretion but rather reduces insulin secretion chronically owing to improved peripheral insulin sensitivity. Insulin resistance is a strong driver of NAFLD, and 0602K improves aspects of NASH histology in both mice and humans (13Harrison S.A. Alkhouri N. Davison B.A. Sanyal A. Edwards C. Colca J.R. Lee B.H.

To test if NASH was more significantly improved with dual 0602K and Lira therapy, MS-NASH mice were fed a Western diet and provided fructose in the drinking water to develop obesity and NASH. Vehicle, 0602K, Lira, or 0602K+Lira treatments were started after 18 weeks on diet, and similar to the db/db study, 0602K-treated mice tended to display increased body weight (Fig. 6, A and B). Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were monitored monthly, and Lira caused modest reductions in these plasma markers of liver injury, whereas 0602K or 0602K+Lira induced more significant reductions (Fig. 6, C–F). Only 0602K+Lira reduced liver weights compared with vehicle-treated mice; however, as a percentage of body weight, 0602K- or 0602K+Lira-treated mice displayed reduced liver size (Fig. 7, A and B). Liver TAG and glycogen concentrations were unaffected by any treatment in these mice (Fig. 7, C and D). Scoring of liver histology agreed with the biochemical measurements that steatosis was not improved by any treatment (Fig. 7, E and F). However, hepatic inflammation and ballooning were significantly improved by combination 0602K+Lira treatment (Fig. 7, G and H). 0602K or Lira alone improved the NAFLD activity score, whereas the 0602K+Lira combination more significantly improved NASH liver histology (Fig. 7, E and I). Fine bridging fibrosis was identified in all mice, and although the fibrosis histology scores were not improved by any treatment (data not shown), 0602K or 0602K+Lira treatment reduced the expression of several collagen and extracellular matrix–related genes (Fig. 7J). Altogether, these results indicate that the combination of 0602K and Lira improves NASH in this mouse model.Figure 7MSDC-0602K+liraglutide treatment improves NASH pathology.

However, 0602K or 0602K+Lira treatment strongly reduced plasma insulin (Fig. 8B). Plasma NEFAs were also significantly reduced by 0602K or 0602K+Lira treatment (Fig. 8C), suggesting improved insulin action and decreased adipose lipolysis. Finally, insulin immunohistochemistry identified a greater number of insulin+ cells in 0602K- or 0602K+Lira-treated pancreata (Fig. 8, D and E). Thus, similar to the db/db study, these results suggest that the improved insulin sensitivity with 0602K increases islet insulin content. The overall goal of these present studies was to assess whether combination of a novel TZD insulin sensitizer and a GLP-1RA would improve diabetes and NASH better than either individual therapy. Studies in db/db mice suggested that combining MSDC-0602K and liraglutide did indeed provide more significant improvement in glucose tolerance. Glycemia, insulinemia, and insulin sensitivity were greatly improved with 0602K and not further improved by 0602K+Lira treatment. 0602K also improved pancreatic insulin content, and 0602K+Lira further increased islet insulin content. In MS-NASH mice, although plasma biomarkers and some aspects of NASH histology were improved by each treatment, more significant improvements were achieved with combination 0602K+Lira. A secondary goal of these studies was to test if the weight loss associated with liraglutide could prevent the weight gain associated with TZDs. In the db/db study, 0602K+Lira-treated mice displayed similar slight weight gain as 0602K-treated mice; however, there was some attenuation of weight gain from combined 0602K+Lira treatment in the MS-NASH study. A study in diabetic rats using a rather low dose of Pioglitazone and double the dose of Lira as used in the current study also observed the greatest improvement in glucose tolerance with Pioglitazone+Lira, and Lira-treated rats lost weight, whereas Pioglitazone+Lira did not attenuate the Pioglitazone-induced weight gain (27Larsen P.J.

However, a study of Pioglitazone+Lira in db/db mice did observe attenuation of the Pioglitazone-induced weight gain with combined Lira treatment (28Kimura T. Kaneto H. Shimoda M. Hirukawa H.

The strongest effects observed in our db/db study were the complete correction of glycemia and reduction in insulinemia with 0602K. This decrease in insulinemia with TZDs has been well described in both humans and animal models of insulin resistance and diabetes (29Miyazaki Y. Matsuda M. DeFronzo R.A.

While a growing body of studies have investigated researcher practices and perceptions related to data sharing, information about data-related practices throughout the research process (including data collection and analysis) remains largely anecdotal. Building on our previous study of data practices in neuroimaging research, we conducted a survey of data management practices in the field of psychology. Our survey included questions about the type(s) of data collected, the tools used for data analysis, practices related to data organization, maintaining documentation, backup procedures, and long-term archiving of research materials. Our results demonstrate the complexity of managing and sharing data in psychology. Data is collected in multifarious forms from human participants, analyzed using a range of software tools, and archived in formats that may become obsolete. As individuals, our participants demonstrated relatively good data management practices, however they also indicated that there was little standardization within their research group. Participants generally indicated that they were willing to change their current practices in light of new technologies, opportunities, or requirements."
https://openalex.org/W3163458111,"Donor-Recipient (D-R) matching is one of the main challenges to be fulfilled nowadays. Due to the increasing number of recipients and the small amount of donors in liver transplantation, the allocation method is crucial. In this paper, to establish a fair comparison, the United Network for Organ Sharing database was used with 4 different end-points (3 months, and 1, 2 and 5 years), with a total of 39, 189 D-R pairs and 28 donor and recipient variables. Modelling techniques were divided into two groups: 1) classical statistical methods, including Logistic Regression (LR) and Naïve Bayes (NB), and 2) standard machine learning techniques, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB) or Support Vector Machines (SVM), among others. The methods were compared with standard scores, MELD, SOFT and BAR. For the 5-years end-point, LR (AUC = 0.654) outperformed several machine learning techniques, such as MLP (AUC = 0.599), GB (AUC = 0.600), SVM (AUC = 0.624) or RF (AUC = 0.644), among others. Moreover, LR also outperformed standard scores. The same pattern was reproduced for the others 3 end-points. Complex machine learning methods were not able to improve the performance of liver allocation, probably due to the implicit limitations associated to the collection process of the database."
https://openalex.org/W3164839808,"Mitochondrial tRNA 3'-end metabolism is critical for the formation of functional tRNAs. Deficient mitochondrial tRNA 3'-end metabolism is linked to an array of human diseases, including optic neuropathy, but their pathophysiology remains poorly understood. In this report, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)-associated tRNAAla 5587A>G mutation, which changes a highly conserved adenosine at position 73 (A73) to guanine (G73) on the 3'-end of the tRNA acceptor stem. The m.5587A>G mutation was identified in three Han Chinese families with suggested maternal inheritance of LHON. We hypothesized that the m.5587A>G mutation altered tRNAAla 3'-end metabolism and mitochondrial function. In vitro processing experiments showed that the m.5587A>G mutation impaired the 3'-end processing of tRNAAla precursors by RNase Z and inhibited the addition of CCA by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (TRNT1). Northern blot analysis revealed that the m.5587A>G mutation perturbed tRNAAla aminoacylation, as evidenced by decreased efficiency of aminoacylation and faster electrophoretic mobility of mutated tRNAAla in these cells. The impact of m.5587A>G mutation on tRNAAla function was further supported by increased melting temperature, conformational changes, and reduced levels of this tRNA. Failures in tRNAAla metabolism impaired mitochondrial translation, perturbed assembly and activity of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, diminished ATP production and membrane potential, and increased production of reactive oxygen species. These pleiotropic defects elevated apoptotic cell death and promoted mitophagy in cells carrying the m.5587A>G mutation, thereby contributing to visual impairment. Our findings may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of LHON arising from mitochondrial tRNA 3'-end metabolism deficiency."

Injuries are caused by intrinsic and extrinsic factors that call for multifactorial preventive interventions. The study examines the impact of the FIFA 11+ warm up programme on the incidence and severity of injuries in second division soccer players in Rwanda.Twelve teams (309 players) were randomised in the intervention group and 12 teams (317 players) in the control group using a cluster randomized controlled trial with teams as the unit of randomization. Intervention group teams implemented the FIFA 11+ soccer specific warm-up programme during training and matches at least three times a week over seven months of the Rwandan soccer season. Control group teams continued with usual warm up exercises. The primary outcome of this study was the overall incidence of training and match injuries. Injuries, training and match exposure as well as severity categories were recorded per the F-MARC guidelines.A lower proportion of players sustained injuries in the intervention group (52%) compared to the control group (63%) (Odd ratio: 0.7; 95%CI: 0.5-0.9). A significantly lower rate ratio was observed in the intervention group for overall (RR = 0.6; 95%CI: 0.5-0.8) and match (RR = 0.6; 95%CI: 0.5-0.8) injuries. Compliance to the injury prevention programme was 77%. In the intervention group, the incidence of injury was similar across all teams and across the medium and highly compliant teams. There was a statistically significant 55% and 71% reduction of the rate of moderate and severe injuries in the intervention group respectively.The 11+ warm up injury prevention programme resulted in a significant reduction in the odds of sustaining injuries. In addition, injuries sustained were less severe. The programme should be rolled out to all teams in Rwanda and may well result in a decrease in the incidence and severity of injury in similar contexts.Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR201505001045388)."
https://openalex.org/W3162814154,"Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive lung disease often occurring secondary to environmental exposure. Asbestos exposure is an important environmental mediator of lung fibrosis and remains a significant cause of disease despite strict regulations to limit exposure. Lung macrophages play an integral role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis induced by asbestos (asbestosis), in part by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promoting resistance to apoptosis. However, the mechanism by which macrophages acquire apoptosis resistance is not known. Here, we confirm that macrophages isolated from asbestosis subjects are resistant to apoptosis and show they are associated with enhanced mitochondrial content of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), which generates mitochondrial ROS generation. Similar results were seen in chrysotile-exposed WT mice, while macrophages from Nox4-/- mice showed increased apoptosis. NOX4 regulated apoptosis resistance by activating Akt1-mediated Bcl-2-associated death phosphorylation. Demonstrating the importance of NOX4-mediated apoptosis resistance in fibrotic remodeling, mice harboring a conditional deletion of Nox4 in monocyte-derived macrophages exhibited increased apoptosis and were protected from pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, resolution occurred when Nox4 was deleted in monocyte-derived macrophages in mice with established fibrosis. These observations suggest that NOX4 regulates apoptosis resistance in monocyte-derived macrophages and contributes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Targeting NOX4-mediated apoptosis resistance in monocyte-derived macrophages may provide a novel therapeutic target to protect against the development and/or progression of pulmonary fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3165373599,"The Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (KPC-2) is a common source of antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacterial infections. KPC-2 is a class A β-lactamase that exhibits a broad substrate profile and hydrolyzes most β-lactam antibiotics including carbapenems owing to rapid deacylation of the covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate. However, the features that allow KPC-2 to deacylate substrates more rapidly than non-carbapenemase enzymes are not clear. The active-site residues in KPC-2 are largely conserved in sequence and structure compared with non-carbapenemases, suggesting that subtle alterations may collectively facilitate hydrolysis of carbapenems. We utilized a nonbiased genetic approach to identify mutants deficient in carbapenem hydrolysis but competent for ampicillin hydrolysis. Subsequent pre–steady-state enzyme kinetics analyses showed that the substitutions slow the rate of deacylation of carbapenems. Structure determination via X-ray diffraction indicated that a F72Y mutant forms a hydrogen bond between the tyrosine hydroxyl group and Glu166, which may lower basicity and impair the activation of the catalytic water for deacylation, whereas several mutants impact the structure of the Q214-R220 active site loop. A T215P substitution lowers the deacylation rate and drastically alters the conformation of the loop, thereby disrupting interactions between the enzyme and the carbapenem acyl-enzyme intermediate. Thus, the environment of the Glu166 general base and the precise placement and conformational stability of the Q214-R220 loop are critical for efficient deacylation of carbapenems by the KPC-2 enzyme. Therefore, the design of carbapenem antibiotics that interact with Glu166 or alter the Q214-R220 loop conformation may disrupt enzyme function and overcome resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3162197640,"After activation of G protein–coupled receptors, G protein βγ dimers may translocate from the plasma membrane to the Golgi apparatus (GA). We recently report that this translocation activates extracellular signal–regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) via PI3Kγ; however, how Gβγ–PI3Kγ activates the ERK1/2 pathway is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that chemokine receptor CXCR4 activates ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), a small GTPase important for vesicle-mediated membrane trafficking. This activation is blocked by CRISPR–Cas9-mediated knockout of the GA-translocating Gγ9 subunit. Inducible targeting of different Gβγ dimers to the GA can directly activate ARF1. CXCR4 activation and constitutive Gβγ recruitment to the GA also enhance ARF1 translocation to the GA. We further demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition and CRISPR–Cas9-mediated knockout of PI3Kγ markedly inhibit CXCR4-mediated and Gβγ translocation–mediated ARF1 activation. We also show that depletion of ARF1 by siRNA and CRISPR–Cas9 and inhibition of GA-localized ARF1 activation abolish ERK1/2 activation by CXCR4 and Gβγ translocation to the GA and suppress prostate cancer PC3 cell migration and invasion. Collectively, our data reveal a novel function for Gβγ translocation to the GA to activate ARF1 and identify GA-localized ARF1 as an effector acting downstream of Gβγ–PI3Kγ to spatiotemporally regulate G protein–coupled receptor signaling to mitogen-activated protein kinases. After activation of G protein–coupled receptors, G protein βγ dimers may translocate from the plasma membrane to the Golgi apparatus (GA). We recently report that this translocation activates extracellular signal–regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) via PI3Kγ; however, how Gβγ–PI3Kγ activates the ERK1/2 pathway is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that chemokine receptor CXCR4 activates ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), a small GTPase important for vesicle-mediated membrane trafficking. This activation is blocked by CRISPR–Cas9-mediated knockout of the GA-translocating Gγ9 subunit. Inducible targeting of different Gβγ dimers to the GA can directly activate ARF1. CXCR4 activation and constitutive Gβγ recruitment to the GA also enhance ARF1 translocation to the GA. We further demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition and CRISPR–Cas9-mediated knockout of PI3Kγ markedly inhibit CXCR4-mediated and Gβγ translocation–mediated ARF1 activation. We also show that depletion of ARF1 by siRNA and CRISPR–Cas9 and inhibition of GA-localized ARF1 activation abolish ERK1/2 activation by CXCR4 and Gβγ translocation to the GA and suppress prostate cancer PC3 cell migration and invasion. Collectively, our data reveal a novel function for Gβγ translocation to the GA to activate ARF1 and identify GA-localized ARF1 as an effector acting downstream of Gβγ–PI3Kγ to spatiotemporally regulate G protein–coupled receptor signaling to mitogen-activated protein kinases. G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest and most structurally diverse superfamily of membrane signaling proteins and modulate a wide variety of fundamental cellular processes (1Weis W.I.

Although the functions of GPCRs are mainly mediated through typical signaling cascades at the plasma membrane (PM) to activate cognate heterotrimeric G proteins, arrestins, and other signaling molecules, recent studies have demonstrated that the activation of PM GPCRs can induce the translocation of Gβγ dimers from the PM to the Golgi apparatus (GA) and the translocation efficiency is mainly determined by Gγ subunits, particularly their C termini (3Akgoz M.

We recently demonstrate that Gβγ translocation to the GA induced by both CXCR4 activation and direct recruitment strongly activates extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), two members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, and this function of Gβγ is mediated through PI3Kγ (9Wei Z. Xu X. Fang Y. Khater M. Naughton S.X. Hu G. Terry Jr., A.V. Wu G. Rab43 GTPase directs post-synaptic trafficking and neuron-specific sorting of G protein-coupled receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) belong to the superfamily of Ras-related small GTPases. Among six ARFs (ARF1–6) identified in mammalian cells, ARF1 is the best-studied and well-understood member. ARF1 localizes mainly throughout the GA and in the cytoplasm but also at the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment, trans-Golgi network, endosomes, and the PM. ARF1 is best known for its functions in maintaining the structure and function of the GA and in vesicular trafficking, particularly in the formation of coat protein complex I– and clathrin-coated vesicles, which mediate cargo transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the GA and between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes, respectively (17D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. ARF proteins: Roles in membrane traffic and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 18Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. ARF family G proteins and their regulators: Roles in membrane transport, development and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 362-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). As with all other small GTPases, ARF1 undergoes cycling between the active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound conformations, which is under control by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins. Among 15 ARF–GEFs encoded in the human genome, three high–molecular weight GEFs (GBF1, BIG1, and BIG2), which mainly localize at the GA, and four low–molecular weight GEFs (cytohesin 1–4), which largely express at the PM and endosomes, are able to activate ARF1 (17D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. ARF proteins: Roles in membrane traffic and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 18Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. ARF family G proteins and their regulators: Roles in membrane transport, development and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 362-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that Gβγ translocation to the GA strongly activates ARF1 via PI3Kγ and that GA-localized ARF1 mediates ERK1/2 activation by chemokine receptor CXCR4 activation and Gβγ translocation to the GA. These data provide important insights into how activation of GA-localized ARF1 by Gβγ translocation to the GA spatially and temporally controls GPCR signaling to the MAPK pathway. We first determined if activation of endogenous CXCR4 by stromal cell–derived factor 1α (SDF1α) could activate ARF1 in human androgen–insensitive prostate cancer (DU145 and PC3) cells and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. As measured in glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein pulldown assays, ARF1 activation by SDF1α was in a dose-dependent fashion in all three cell types and the EC50 values were 6.3 ± 0.43, 7.0 ± 0.35, and 4.1 ± 0.52 nM in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). We next defined the role of G proteins in ARF1 activation by SDF1α. Treatment with pertussis toxin and the Gβγ-specific inhibitor gallein markedly inhibited ARF1 activation by SDF1α (Fig. 1C), suggestive of a role of Gβγ dimers, but not Gα subunits, in ARF1 activation by SDF1α. In addition, treatment with AMD3100, a specific CXCR4 antagonist, abolished ARF1 activation by SDF1α (Fig. 1C). To determine the role of Gβγ translocation onto the GA in ARF1 activation, we determined the effects of CRISPR–Cas9-mediated knockout of Gγ9 and Gγ3 on ARF1 activation by SDF1α. Previous studies have shown that Gγ9 is the most GA-translocating Gγ subunit, whereas Gγ3 is the least GA-translocating Gγ subunit in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells (9Wei Z. Xu X. Fang Y. Khater M. Naughton S.X. Hu G. Terry Jr., A.V. Wu G. Rab43 GTPase directs post-synaptic trafficking and neuron-specific sorting of G protein-coupled receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Gγ9 knockout completely abolished, whereas Gγ3 knockout did not affect ARF1 activation by SDF1α (Fig. 1D). To further confirm the role of Gβγ translocation to the GA in ARF1 activation, we compared the abilities to rescue ARF1 activation in Gγ9 knockout cells by single-guide RNA (sgRNA)–resistant Gγ9 and its mutant Gγ9-3 in which the C-terminal 14 residues of Gγ9 were substituted with the C-terminal 15 residues of Gγ3 (Fig. 2A). Consistent with previous studies (6Chisari M. Saini D.K. Cho J.H. Kalyanaraman V. Gautam N. G protein subunit dissociation and translocation regulate cellular response to receptor stimulation.PLoS One. 2009; 4e7797Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Wei Z. Xu X. Fang Y. Khater M. Naughton S.X. Hu G. Terry Jr., A.V. Wu G. Rab43 GTPase directs post-synaptic trafficking and neuron-specific sorting of G protein-coupled receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), Gγ9 robustly translocated from the PM to the GA with greater than 70% efficacy, whereas Gγ9-3 remained largely at the PM with only 15% being translocated to the GA after SDF1α stimulation in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). As expected, transient expression of sgRNA-resistant Gγ9 successfully rescued ARF1 activation by SDF1α in Gγ9 knockout cells. In contrast, expression of GA translocation defective mutant Gγ9-3 was ineffective (Fig. 2D). These data strongly suggest that ARF1 activation by SDF1α is mediated through Gβγ translocation to the GA. We next determined the effect of direct recruitment of Gβγ dimers onto the GA and PM on ARF1 activation by using the well-characterized rapamycin-inducible translocation system in which GA- and PM-targeting peptides were fused to FK506-binding protein (FKBP), whereas cytosolic Gγ subunits were fused to the FKBP–rapamycin binding (FRB) domain (9Wei Z. Xu X. Fang Y. Khater M. Naughton S.X. Hu G. Terry Jr., A.V. Wu G. Rab43 GTPase directs post-synaptic trafficking and neuron-specific sorting of G protein-coupled receptors.J. Biol.

Rapamycin-induced GA recruitment of Gγ2, Gγ3, or Gγ9 subunits (Golgi-Gγ), each in complex with Gβ1, activated ARF1 in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells. In contrast, their recruitment onto the PM (PM-Gγ) had no clear effect on ARF1 activation (Fig. 3A). Rapamycin incubation to induce Gγ9 translocation to the GA activated ARF1 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3, B and C). ARF1 activation by Golgi-Gγ9 was strongly blocked by coexpression of GA-localized GRK2ct, which binds Gβγ dimers, but not GRK2ctR587Q mutant, which lacks the Gβγ-binding ability (Fig. 3D). ARF1 activation by Golgi-Gγ9 was also inhibited by treatment with all Golgi disruptors tested, including ilimaquinone, monensin, nigericin, nocodazole, swainsonine, and brefeldin A (Fig. 3E). These data demonstrate that constitutive targeting of different Gβγ dimers to the GA can directly activate ARF1. It has been well demonstrated that, similar to many other small GTPases, the active form of ARF1 is membrane bound, whereas the inactive form of ARF1 is cytosolic (19Zhou F. Dong C. Davis J.E.

As such, we used confocal microscopy to define the effect of CXCR4 activation and constitutive Gβγ targeting to the GA on the recruitment of endogenous ARF1 to the GA, which presumably reflects its activation. At the basal level, ARF1 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm with less than one-third of total ARF1 at the GA in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells as quantified by using p230 as a GA marker. After SDF1α stimulation for 5 min, more than 90% of total ARF1 translocated to the GA (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar to SDF1α stimulation, rapamycin-induced GA recruitment of Gγ2, Gγ3, or Gγ9 subunits in complex with Gβ1 dramatically increased ARF1 localization at the GA in PC3 cells (Fig. 4, C and D). In contrast, rapamycin-induced PM recruitment of Gγ9 in complex with Gβ1 did not affect the subcellular distribution of ARF1 in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells (Fig. S1). These data further demonstrate that CXCR4 activation and Gβγ translocation to the GA are able to activate ARF1. As PI3Kγ is a well-known downstream effector of Gβγ and mediates ERK1/2 activation by Gβγ translocation to the GA (9Wei Z. Xu X. Fang Y. Khater M. Naughton S.X. Hu G. Terry Jr., A.V. Wu G. Rab43 GTPase directs post-synaptic trafficking and neuron-specific sorting of G protein-coupled receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), we determined its role in ARF1 activation by CXCR4 and Golgi-Gγ9. Inhibition of PI3K activation by LY294002, wortmannin (two common PI3K inhibitors), AS-604850 (a PI3Kγ inhibitor) and GSK2292767 (a PI3Kδ inhibitor), but not with HS-173 (a PI3Kα inhibitor) and TGX-221 (a PI3Kβ inhibitor), significantly inhibited ARF1 activation by SDF1α (Fig. 5, A and B). The inhibitory action of AS-604850 was in a dose-dependent fashion, and the IC50 values were 0.23 ± 0.08, 0.31 ± 0.06, and 0.21 ± 0.04 μM in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells, respectively (Fig. 5, C and D). Inhibition of PI3Kγ activation by AS-604850 also reduced ARF1 activation induced by Golgi-Gγ9 (Fig. 5E). CRISPR–Cas9-mediated knockout of p110γ, the catalytic subunit of PI3Kγ, completely abolished ARF1 activation by SDF1α stimulation (Fig. 5F) and Golgi-Gγ9 (Fig. 5G). These data demonstrate that PI3Kγ is an important element in ARF1 activation by CXCR4 and Gβγ translocation to the GA. Our preceding data have shown that, similar to ERK1/2 activation, Gβγ translocation to the GA activates ARF1 via PI3Kγ, suggesting that ARF1 may function as a downstream effector of Gβγ–PI3Kγ to activate ERK1/2. To test this possibility, we first determined the effect of ARF1 depletion by siRNA and CRISPR–Cas9 on ERK1/2 activation by CXCR4 and Gβγ translocation to the GA. ARF1 knockdown by siRNA substantially inhibited ERK1/2 activation by SDF1α (Fig. 6A) and Golgi-Gγ9 (Fig. 6B) in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells. ARF1 knockout by CRISPR–Cas9 also remarkably inhibited ERK1/2 activation by SDF1α stimulation (Fig. 6C) and Golgi-Gγ9 (Fig. 6D). These data demonstrate that the normal expression of endogenous ARF1 is directly linked to ERK1/2 activation by CXCR4 and Gβγ translocation to the GA. To exclude the possibility that the inhibitory effect of ARF1 depletion on ERK1/2 activation by SDF1α stimulation is partially attributable to its effect on the cell surface expression of CXCR4, we visualized the subcellular localization of CXCR4 in ARF1-depleted cells by confocal microscopy. ARF1 depletion by siRNA and CRISPR–Cas9 did not affect the surface presentation of CXCR4 in all three cell types tested (Fig. S2, A and B). We next determined the effects of inhibiting ARF1 on ERK1/2 activation by CXCR4 and Gβγ translocation to the GA. For this purpose, three small molecule inhibitors, including golgicide A (GCA), Exo2, and secinH3, were used. Whereas GCA and Exo2 selectively inhibit Golgi-associated ARF–GEFs, secinH3 inhibits only PM-associated ARF–GEFs (22Hafner M. Schmitz A. Grune I. Srivatsan S.G. Paul B. Kolanus W. Quast T. Kremmer E.

Treatment with these GEF inhibitors for 30 min did not affect the surface expression of CXCR4 (Fig. S2C). Treatment with GCA and Exo2, but not secinH3, dramatically attenuated ARF1 activation by SDF1α in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells (Fig. 7A), suggesting that activated ARF1 is mainly localized on the GA in these cells. Inhibition of ARF1 activation by Exo2 was in a dose-dependent fashion, and the IC50 values were 8.7 ± 0.6, 9.2 ± 0.3, and 16.1 ± 0.8 μM in DU145, PC3, and HEK293 cells, respectively (Fig. 7, B and C). Similarly, treatment with GCA and Exo2, but not secinH3, strongly attenuated ARF1 localization at the GA in response to SDF1α stimulation in all three cell lines studied (Fig. 7, D and E and Fig. S3). In parallel with their abilities to inhibit ARF1 activation, GCA and Exo2 almost completely abolished ERK1/2 activation by SDF1α (Fig. 8A). Similarly, treatment with GCA and Exo2 markedly inhibited ERK1/2 activation by inducible Gβγ translocation to the GA (Fig. 8B). In contrast, treatment with secinH3 had no effect on ERK1/2 by SDF1α and forced Gβγ recruitment to the GA (Fig. 8, A and B). These data suggest that GA-localized ARF1 activation is an important event for ERK1/2 activation by CXCR4 and Gβγ translocation to the GA. Although ARF1 is described to regulate a number of cellular processes in response to activation with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (17D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. ARF proteins: Roles in membrane traffic and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 18Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. ARF family G proteins and their regulators: Roles in membrane transport, development and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 362-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), its roles in GPCR-mediated cell functions remain poorly defined. As such, we determined the effect of ARF1 inhibition and depletion on cell migration and invasion in response to SDF1α stimulation using PC3 cells as models in in vitro transwell assays. Stimulation with fetal bovine serum (FBS) was used as a positive control. As expected, stimulation with SDF1α strongly enhanced PC3 cell migration and invasion, which were significantly inhibited by treatment with GCA, Exo2, and AS-604850, but not secinH3 (Fig. 9A). ARF1 depletion by siRNA (Fig. 9B) and CRISPR–Cas9 (Fig. 9C) also greatly suppressed PC3 cell migration and invasion in response to SDF1α stimulation. These data demonstrate that the activation of ARF1, specifically at the GA, directly controls prostate cancer cell migration and invasion in response to CXCR4 activation. In this study, we first identify a novel function of Gβγ translocation from the PM to the GA to activate the small GTPase ARF1 in three different cells. This function of Gβγ translocation to the GA is strongly supported by the following series of experiments, which use GST fusion protein pulldown assays to biochemically quantify the active form of ARF1. First, knockout of the most GA-translocating Gγ9 subunit, but not the least GA-translocating Gγ3 subunit, abolishes ARF1 activation by CXCR4. Second, wildtype Gγ9, but not its mutant Gγ9-3 defective in GA translocation, is able to rescue ARF1 activation by CXCR4 in Gγ9 knockout cells. Third, chemically induced GA translocation of different Gβγ dimers containing Gγ2, Gγ3, or Gγ9, all constitutively activates ARF1, suggesting that different Gβγ combinations, once expressed at the GA, can activate ARF1. Fourth, inhibition of GA-localized Gβγ via GRK2ct, as well as GA disruptors, inhibits ARF1 activation by Gβγ translocation to the GA. The function of Gβγ translocation to the GA in activating ARF1 is also supported by confocal imaging showing that constitutive GA translocation of Gβγ dimers, as well as CXCR4 activation, markedly enhances the GA localization of ARF1, which presumably represents its active form. In addition, we have demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of PI3Kγ and knockout of its catalytic subunit p110γ block ARF1 activation by CXCR4 and Gβγ translocation to the GA, indicative of a crucial role of PI3Kγ in ARF1 activation, which is consistent with its function in ARF1 activation by formyl peptide receptors in neutrophils (26Mazaki Y. Nishimura Y. Sabe H. GBF1 bears a novel phosphatidylinositol-phosphate binding module, BP3K, to link PI3Kgamma activity with Arf1 activation involved in GPCR-mediated neutrophil chemotaxis and superoxide production.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 2457-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, Gβγ translocation to the GA induced by both GPCR activation and direct recruitment is able to activate ARF1, which is mediated through activation of PI3Kγ. Another important finding of the current study is that GA-localized ARF1 is an essential mediator for ERK1/2 activation by CXCR4 and Gβγ translocation to the GA. This became evident by our data demonstrating that ARF1 depletion by siRNA and CRISPR–Cas9 and pharmacological inhibition of GA-localized ARF1 abolish ERK1/2 activation by CXCR4 and constitutive Gβγ translocation to the GA. This is also strongly supported by our previous studies showing that expression of constitutively active GTP-bound ARF1 mutant, which almost exclusively localizes at the GA, directly activates the Raf–MEK–ERK1/2 pathway in the absence of any extracellular stimuli (19Zhou F.

Altogether, these studies provide strong evidence indicating that ARF1 activation by Gβγ translocation to the GA spatially and temporally regulate GPCR signaling to MAPK, and that the GA provides a platform to compartmentalize the important events involved in GPCR signaling, including the translocation of Gβγ and sequential activation of PI3Kγ, A"

Several lines of evidence suggest that oligomeric αSN is cytotoxic, making it important to devise strategies to either prevent oligomer formation and/or inhibit the ensuing toxicity. (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has emerged as a molecular modulator of αSN self-assembly, as it reduces the flexibility of the C-terminal region of αSN in the oligomer and inhibits the oligomer's ability to perturb phospholipid membranes and induce cell death. However, a detailed structural and kinetic characterization of this interaction is still lacking. Here, we use liquid-state NMR spectroscopy to investigate how EGCG interacts with monomeric and oligomeric forms of αSN. We find that EGCG can bind to all parts of monomeric αSN but exhibits highest affinity for the N-terminal region. Monomeric αSN binds ∼54 molecules of EGCG in total during oligomerization. Furthermore, kinetic data suggest that EGCG dimerization is coupled with the αSN association reaction. In contrast, preformed oligomers only bind ∼7 EGCG molecules per protomer, in agreement with the more compact nature of the oligomer compared with the natively unfolded monomer. In previously conducted cell assays, as little as 0.36 EGCG per αSN reduce oligomer toxicity by 50%. Our study thus demonstrates that αSN cytotoxicity can be inhibited by small molecules at concentrations at least an order of magnitude below full binding capacity. We speculate this is due to cooperative binding of protein-stabilized EGCG dimers, which in turn implies synergy between protein association and EGCG dimerization.

The intrinsically disordered human protein α-synuclein (αSN) accumulates in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease as intracellular deposits called Lewy bodies (1Spillantini M.G.

Recently, it was shown that monomeric αSN and iron-induced oligomeric forms of αSN interact in different ways with lipid membranes: whereas monomers cause membrane thinning and oligomers interact with and lead to changes within lipid raft–like domains (10Perissinotto F.

Different types of oligomers have been identified; some are thought to be obligate intermediates in fibril formation, whereas others are off pathway, forming independently and even inhibiting fibrillation (11Lorenzen N.

This oligomer consists of 30 protomers that form a compact β-sheet core surrounded by a diffuse corona (14Zijlstra N. Blum C. Segers-Nolten I.M.J. Claessens M.M.A.E. Subramaniam V.

Given the demonstrated toxicity of oligomeric αSN, there is great interest in compounds that prevent their formation, or, once formed, reduce their toxicity. One such compound is (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Although EGCG typically shows low affinity for folded proteins (16Ehrnhoefer D.E. Bieschke J. Boeddrich A. Herbst M. Masino L. Lurz R.

Whereas naked oligomers insert into and disrupt the membrane (possibly in association with interaction between protein and lipids and conformational changes to the oligomer (27Sciacca M.F.

Structural basis of membrane disruption and cellular toxicity by alpha-synuclein oligomers.Science. 2017; 358: 1440-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To complicate matters, αSN can form multiple different species of coexisting oligomers (13Paslawski W. Mysling S. Thomsen K. Jørgensen T.J.D. Otzen D.E. Co-existence of two different α-synuclein oligomers with different core structures determined by hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

This makes it difficult to study the effect of EGCG on the interaction between oligomeric and monomeric αSN. As a result, we still lack a detailed structural and kinetic characterization of the interaction between EGCG and αSN in the process of oligomer formation. Obtained under in vitro conditions to obtain maximal structural insight, such advances provide a foundation to better understand how these oligomers subsequently may interact with membranes and other components in the cell. Here, we use liquid-state NMR spectroscopy (30Ahmed R. Melacini G. A solution NMR toolset to probe the molecular mechanisms of amyloid inhibitors.Chem. Commun. 2018; 54: 4644-4652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cawood E.E. Karamanos T.K. Wilson A.J. Radford S.E. Visualizing and trapping transient oligomers in amyloid assembly pathways.Biophys. Chem. 2021; 268: 106505Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to show that EGCG binds to monomeric and oligomeric αSN. We find that monomeric and oligomeric αSN bind 54 and 7 EGCG molecules, respectively, and that EGCG slowly (over a 4-day period) binds to and immobilizes all protein residues. We suggest that these binding properties may explain the broad spectrum of activity by EGCG toward cytotoxic protein oligomers, and that related polyphenols act to bind together disordered proteins in a comparable way. Determination of the stoichiometry of EGCG binding to αSN monomer by conventional titration is complicated by the fact that αSN oligomerizes in a time-dependent manner when EGCG is present (8Fusco G. Chen S.W. Williamson P.T.F. Cascella R. Perni M. Jarvis J.A. Cecchi C. Vendruscolo M. Chiti F. Cremades N. Ying L.M. Dobson C.M. De Simone A.

Biol. 2008; 15: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Therefore, separate samples of αSN monomer were incubated with different amounts of EGCG, making sure to have identical incubation time (10 min) before recording 1D 1H-NMR spectra. Changes in the NMR spectra of both EGCG and αSN are expected upon interaction (for EGCG NMR assignments, see Fig. S1). These changes should manifest themselves as line broadening or chemical shift perturbation, with the exact outcome depending on binding kinetics (30Ahmed R. Melacini G. A solution NMR toolset to probe the molecular mechanisms of amyloid inhibitors.Chem. Commun. 2018; 54: 4644-4652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that our observations could be captured by a minimal model that considers (1) free and bound states for the protein as well as for EGCG and (2) that broadening of the NMR signals is caused by the modulation of the chemical (and magnetic) environment of the nuclei in the limiting states (free and bound), although more complex models can be envisaged (e.g., intermediate exchange line broadening intrinsic to the bound form of EGCG and influence of EGCG on the self-association state of αSN). In addition, once oligomers of high molecular weight have formed, even a small population of the bound form in a weak-affinity interaction can bring about severe line broadening (32Fawzi N.L. Ying J. Ghirlando R. Torchia D.A. Clore G.M. Atomic-resolution dynamics on the surface of amyloid-β protofibrils probed by solution NMR.Nature. 2011; 480: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Figure 1A displays the aliphatic region of 1D 1H-NMR spectra at different EGCG:αSN ratios. The region (2.5–0.75 ppm) shows signals from aliphatic side chains (mostly methyl groups) of αSN (EGCG does not show any resonances here, see Fig. S1) and is used to gauge the fate of the protein in solution. In contrast, the aromatic region (7.5–5.5 ppm) is dominated by EGCG (in red boxes in Fig. 1B), although there are weak signals from αSN's four Tyr and two Phe residues around 7.4 to 6.8 ppm (see lowest trace in Fig. 1B). Strikingly, using 10-min incubation, all protein signals fully disappeared when the [EGCG]:[αSN] ratio was 60:1 (Fig. 1, A–C), whereas only a very modest decrease was observed for αSN signals when titrating in the first 20 equivalents of EGCG. At the same time, EGCG NMR signals initially increased linearly with concentration up to 20 EGCG per αSN, in proportion to the amount of EGCG added, but upon an increase from 20:1 to 60:1, also all the EGCG signals vanished (Fig. 1, A–C). Since we did not see any precipitation, this implies that at ligand-to-protein ratios in the range 20 to 60, all EGCGs become sequestered in large, soluble, or dispersed assemblies that simultaneously cause both αSN and EGCG signals to become NMR invisible. This is the kind of behavior expected for molecules in a slow tumbling complex. Negative-stain EM demonstrated that loss of the NMR spectrum coincided with the formation of oligomeric species of ∼20 nm diameter (16Ehrnhoefer D.E. Bieschke J. Boeddrich A. Herbst M. Masino L. Lurz R. Engemann S. Pastore A. Wanker E.E. EGCG redirects amyloidogenic polypeptides into unstructured, off-pathway oligomers.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Upon further addition of EGCG, αSN continues to remain NMR invisible, whereas a re-emergence of visible EGCG NMR signals is seen (Fig. 1C). The EGCG signals scale with the amount added, indicating accumulation of unbound EGCG. Consistent with this explanation, the line width of the EGCG peak for H2’,6’ is very little affected up to [EGCG]:[αSN] = 20:1. This indicates that, over the course of a 10-min incubation, most EGCG molecules exist in solution, and are only little affected by the presence of αSN, until a critical ratio is reached beyond 20 EGCGs per αSN. Once the NMR-invisible species have been fully formed, the signals of free ligand once more increase in intensity with further EGCG addition, but the peaks are very wide (Fig. 1, B and D). Broad peaks observed for small molecules typically point to the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between a rapidly tumbling free state and a slowly tumbling bound state (30Ahmed R. Melacini G. A solution NMR toolset to probe the molecular mechanisms of amyloid inhibitors.Chem. Commun. 2018; 54: 4644-4652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As 1H-NMR spectra of free EGCG consistently show sharp signals over the concentration range (0.15–3 mM) used in the αSN titration study (Fig. S3), we can rule out that broad signals result from self-association of EGCG (33Wróblewski K.

Food Chem. 2002; 50: 1593-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar).We conclude that a stoichiometrically well-defined EGCG:αSN complex is formed in the presence of a critical number of EGCG molecules. To obtain mechanistic insight into the self-assembly process, we next investigated the time-dependent structural changes that take place during coincubation. To address this, EGCG and αSN were mixed at EGCG:αSN molar ratios ranging from 8.7 to 51.9, and a series of NMR spectra were recorded over time. A marked decline was observed for all 1D 1H-NMR signals (Fig. 2A), whereas no such decline in signals was seen in a control experiment (i.e., in the absence of EGCG; data not shown). Using the integrated intensity of αSN protein NMR signals (2.5–0.6 ppm), the signal loss could be fitted using an exponential decay function (assuming that all signal is eventually lost), giving a rate constant k, which increased in a power-law fashion with EGCG:αSN stoichiometry up to 34.6 (Fig. 2B) (at higher stoichiometries, the signal change was too small to provide a reliable estimate of the rate constant). The order of a chemical reaction with regard to a given reactant can formally be determined by plotting the logarithm of the rate v (estimated from the initial slope in Fig. 2A) versus the logarithm of the concentration of that reactant. Whether using k or v, we obtain a slope of ∼2, which indicates that two EGCG molecules associate per reaction step, suggesting an EGCG dimerization associated with the mechanism of interaction with αSN. We note that at neutral pH, EGCG dimerizes (on the minute–hour scale) because of oxidation (36Sang S. Yang I. Buckley B. Ho C.-T. Yang C.S.

Food Chem. 2005; 53: 9478-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and dimeric EGCG has been shown to possess a more potent disaggregating effect than monomeric EGCG (38Nie R.Z. Zhu W. Peng J.M. Ge Z.Z. Li C.M. Comparison of disaggregative effect of A-type EGCG dimer and EGCG monomer on the preformed bovine insulin amyloid fibrils.Biophys. Chem. 2017; 230: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Dimerization is possible, but not conclusively demonstrated by these data, which provide a lower limit for cooperativity of the EGCG–αSN interaction. Interestingly, this slow signal decay was preceded by a very rapid loss of signal within the dead time of measurement (6–18 min) corresponding to a burst phase. The magnitude of this burst phase increased linearly with EGCG stoichiometry from 25.9 to 51.9 EGCG, and this linear phase extrapolated to the upper limit of 1.0 (i.e., complete disappearance of the αSN methyl signal) around 54 [EGCG]:[αSN] (Fig. 2C). Assuming that rapid binding of EGCG to αSN within the dead time is responsible for this signal disappearance, this suggests that αSN has a capacity to bind up to 54 EGCGs per αSN protomer in the formation of EGCG-induced oligomer. The appearance of EGCG-induced aggregates of αSN was monitored by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 2D), which revealed small round oligomers that resembled those observed in other studies (25Lorenzen N. Nielsen S.B. Yoshimura Y. Vad B.S. Andersen C.B. Betzer C. Kaspersen J.D. Christiansen G. Pedersen J.S. Jensen P.H. Mulder F.A.A. Otzen D.E.

Structural and functional properties of prefibrillar α-synuclein oligomers.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 24526Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), either isolated or connected into chains. We have previously observed small amounts of oligomeric concatamers in the absence of EGCG, but not to the same extent as with EGCG, indicating that EGCG promotes formation of these high molecular weight assemblies. To investigate the oligomerization process with higher structural resolution, time-dependent signal loss was monitored by 2D 15N–1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectroscopy for a 20:1 ligand-to-protein ratio. We observe severe signal loss for all protein residues already after 20 min (Fig. 3A). Based on the observations made at higher EGCG ratio, this observation is consistent with a scenario in which most αSN is sequestered into NMR-invisible oligomeric species, removing all free EGCGs from solution in a cooperative process. As there is insufficient EGCG to aggregate all protein within the first rapid phase (<10% of the signal disappears in the burst phase at 20:1 EGCG:αSN, cf. Fig. 2C; this fraction is likely higher in the HSQC experiment where we have a fivefold increase in αSN and EGCG concentration), the remaining αSN will be subject to slower self-association processes. Plotting signal intensity versus residue number reveals a second and slower loss of the NMR-visible pool that is not evenly distributed over the sequence (Fig. 3B). Resonances belonging to the N-terminal portion of the protein (residues 1–70) are completely lost after 2 h, whereas signals from the C-terminal domain (residues 95–140) still remain detectable after multiple days. Previous 2D 15N–1H HSQC NMR studies have shown that the C-terminal ∼40 residues remain highly mobile (and thus visible) in αSN oligomers"

MARV assembles and buds from the host cell plasma membrane where MARV matrix protein (mVP40) dimers associate with anionic lipids at the plasma membrane inner leaflet and undergo a dynamic and extensive self-oligomerization into the structural matrix layer. The MARV matrix layer confers the virion filamentous shape and stability but how host lipids modulate mVP40 oligomerization is mostly unknown. Using in vitro and cellular techniques, we present a mVP40 assembly model highlighting two distinct oligomerization interfaces: the (N-terminal domain [NTD] and C-terminal domain [CTD]) in mVP40. Cellular studies of NTD and CTD oligomerization interface mutants demonstrate the importance of each interface in matrix assembly. The assembly steps include protein trafficking to the plasma membrane, homo-multimerization that induced protein enrichment, plasma membrane fluidity changes, and elongations at the plasma membrane. An ascorbate peroxidase derivative (APEX)-transmission electron microscopy method was employed to closely assess the ultrastructural localization and formation of viral particles for wildtype mVP40 and NTD and CTD oligomerization interface mutants. Taken together, these studies present a mechanistic model of mVP40 oligomerization and assembly at the plasma membrane during virion assembly that requires interactions with phosphatidylserine for NTD–NTD interactions and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate for proper CTD–CTD interactions.

Understanding the mechanism by which filoviruses assemble to form new virions is tightly related to understanding VP40 structure–function properties upon protein binding to target lipid that may induce or stabilize VP40 oligomers. VP40 is a peripheral protein, and mVP40 lipid binding was first speculated when the protein was shown to accumulate at intracellular membranes, mostly multivesicular bodies and late endosomes early after its synthesis in cells (9Kolesnikova L.

Furthermore, the dimeric and hexameric eVP40 crystal structures were resolved in 2013 lending significant insight to the origins of eVP40 lipid binding and oligomerization (23Bornholdt Z.A. Noda T.

The first proposed model of eVP40 oligomerization and arrangement in 2013, VP40 was shown to form hexamers as building blocks of the matrix layer, postulating that electrostatic interactions facilitate the disengagement of the VP40 CTD from the NTD during matrix assembly. This disengagement sets up a conformational change that exposes two key residues within the NTD, Trp95 and Glu160, as part of an oligomeric interface. In 2016, the dimeric structure of mVP40 was resolved (16Oda S. Noda T. Wijesinghe K.J. Halfmann P. Bornholdt Z.A. Abelson D.M. Armbrust T. Stahelin R.V. Kawaoka Y. Saphire E.O. Crystal structure of Marburg virus VP40 reveals a broad, basic patch for matrix assembly and a requirement of the N-terminal domain for immunosuppression.J. Virol. 2016; 90: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) revealing a conserved Trp (Trp83) and Asn (Asn148) in mVP40 that align with eVP40-Trp95 and Glu160 (Fig. 1A, NTD panel), respectively. In a previous study, we reported that the Trp83 residue was in a region that exhibited significant shielding during mVP40 membrane association using hydrogen–deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) analysis (18Wijesinghe K.J. Urata S. Bhattarai N. Kooijman E.E. Gerstman B.S. Chapagain P.P. Li S. Stahelin R.V.

Chem. 2017; 292: 6108-6122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting it may be important for mVP40 oligomerization following binding to anionic lipids. Furthermore, the previous work demonstrated a reduction of deuterium exchange at the CTD involving residues Leu226 and Ser229 when mVP40 was bound to anionic membranes ((18Wijesinghe K.J. Urata S. Bhattarai N. Kooijman E.E. Gerstman B.S. Chapagain P.P. Li S. Stahelin R.V.

Chem. 2017; 292: 6108-6122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), Fig. 1A). Of note, this region, dubbed α-helix 4 (α4 helix), just underlies the lipid-binding surface and is distinct in residue composition and in structure when compared with eVP40. Therefore, we postulated two separate oligomerization interfaces within dimeric mVP40, one involving the CTD α4 helix and a conserved interface within the NTD, as key regulators of mVP40 oligomerization (18Wijesinghe K.J. Urata S. Bhattarai N. Kooijman E.E. Gerstman B.S. Chapagain P.P. Li S. Stahelin R.V. Detection of lipid-induced structural changes of the Marburg virus matrix protein VP40 using hydrogen/deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 6108-6122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, the initial model of VP40 oligomerization was used. This model involved the formation of VP40 hexamer at the membrane as a building block of the viral matrix assembly. However, a new model of linear arrangement of dimeric VP40 forming a 2D lattice that assembles across the virion membrane has been reported (31Wan W. Clarke M. Norris M.J. Kolesnikova L. Koehler A. Bornholdt Z.A. Becker S. Saphire E.O. Briggs J.A. Ebola and Marburg virus matrix layers are locally ordered assemblies of VP40 dimers.Elife. 2020; 9e59225Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this model, the linear arrangement of VP40 was shown to be mediated by CTD–CTD interactions (31Wan W. Clarke M. Norris M.J. Kolesnikova L. Koehler A. Bornholdt Z.A. Becker S. Saphire E.O. Briggs J.A. Ebola and Marburg virus matrix layers are locally ordered assemblies of VP40 dimers.Elife. 2020; 9e59225Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism of lipid-induced mVP40 oligomerization, we assessed different in vitro lipid binding assays with HDX-MS analysis to study the effect of mutations at potential NTD and/or CTD oligomerization interfaces in mVP40 conformational changes upon binding membranes. Then, we conducted cellular studies to rationally investigate how the NTD and CTD oligomerization interfaces coordinate the matrix of mVP40 at the plasma membrane. Findings described here demonstrate that each oligomerization interface mutant displays a significant defect in VLP budding, impairment in overall and proper mVP40 trafficking, and oligomerization at the plasma membrane. In order to better understand the origins of mVP40 oligomers, we constructed the mVP40 hexamer–hexamer interface using the eVP40 hexamer–hexamer interface as the template (Protein Data Bank ID: 4LDD) and performed a 100-ns molecular dynamics simulation. Figure 1B shows the section of the mVP40 filament composed of two hexamers next to each other involving CTD–CTD interactions (Fig. S1A). To test our hypothesis that both the conserved NTD and newly identified residues in the CTD are involved in mVP40 oligomerization, we first generated several mutant constructs. These included the NTD oligomerization interface double mutant W83R/N148A and a CTD oligomerization interface double mutant L226R/S229A. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of purified proteins indicated that all proteins formed dimers in solution (Fig. S2). To dissect changes in mVP40 residue solvent accessibility and oligomerization in the absence and presence of membranes, HDX-MS experiments were performed on mVP40 mutants incubated with liposomes containing 45% phosphatidylserine (% molar ratio) as described previously (18Wijesinghe K.J. Urata S. Bhattarai N. Kooijman E.E. Gerstman B.S. Chapagain P.P. Li S. Stahelin R.V. Detection of lipid-induced structural changes of the Marburg virus matrix protein VP40 using hydrogen/deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 6108-6122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In Figure 1C, the ribbon map of the double mutant W83R/N148A indicates the differences in deuterium incorporation (%D) of the protein in presence of PS-containing liposomes compared with the protein alone. Overall, this double mutant showed little detectable changes in HD exchange pattern in both the NTD (from residue Met1 to Lys47) and CTD (from residue Met263 to Ala284). Similarly, residues Lys96-Gly106 on the helix α1 and residues Gln112-Phe120 on the β4-β5 strands exhibited slightly more rapid HD exchanges. Helix α1 is involved in the dimerization of mVP40, and it had been shown previously that the HD exchange at this region is slower in the presence of anionic lipid-containing liposomes (18Wijesinghe K.J. Urata S. Bhattarai N. Kooijman E.E. Gerstman B.S. Chapagain P.P. Li S. Stahelin R.V.

Chem. 2017; 292: 6108-6122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The HDX-MS profile of W83R/N148A also showed an increase of HD exchange at the β6 strand (residues Glu140-Gln146) as well as in the region Met261 to Gln276, which is in basic loop 2 and the β10 strand. Oda et al. (16Oda S. Noda T. Wijesinghe K.J. Halfmann P. Bornholdt Z.A. Abelson D.M. Armbrust T. Stahelin R.V. Kawaoka Y. Saphire E.O. Crystal structure of Marburg virus VP40 reveals a broad, basic patch for matrix assembly and a requirement of the N-terminal domain for immunosuppression.J. Virol. 2016; 90: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) showed that residues in this region are involved in the efficient binding of mVP40 to PS-containing liposomes. All together, these results suggest that the residues Trp83 and Asn148 are involved in the formation of oligomers that shields these specific regions from exposure to the aqueous environment resulting in slow deuterium incorporation/exchange rates upon binding to PS-containing lipid vesicles. Furthermore, the double mutant W83R/N148A exhibited an intermediate change in deuteration level compared with wildtype mVP40 (WT-mVP40) in the presence or absence of zwitterionic phospholipid (Fig. S1B adapted from (18Wijesinghe K.J. Urata S. Bhattarai N. Kooijman E.E. Gerstman B.S. Chapagain P.P. Li S. Stahelin R.V.

Chem. 2017; 292: 6108-6122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)). Next, we analyzed the solvent accessibility of the CTD double mutant L226R/S229A upon binding to PS-containing lipid vesicles. Similar to W83R/N148A, L226R/S229A exhibited an overall increase of the HD exchange profile compared with WT-mVP40 (Fig. S1B), except in the region including residues Ile88-Asn91. Furthermore, no changes of the deuteration level of the β6 strand (residues Glu140-Phe145) were observed for L226R/S229A compared with WT-mVP40, which showed very slow HD exchange in the presence of PS-containing vesicles within the same region (18Wijesinghe K.J.

Chem. 2017; 292: 6108-6122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, L226R/S229A-mVP40 showed a faster HD exchange profile than WT-mVP40, including the following regions: i) in the NTD from residue Tyr13 to Tyr44 (which contains the β1 strand), residues Glu73-Gly87 (unstructured loop between β2-β3 strands and the N terminus of β3 strand), Phe113-Phe120 (β4-β"

The enzymes responsible for trans-sulfurylation have been characterized extensively because they occur in model organisms such as Escherichia coli. However, direct sulfurylation is actually the predominant route for methionine biosynthesis across the phylogenetic tree. In this pathway, most bacteria use an O-acetylhomoserine aminocarboxypropyltransferase (MetY) to catalyze the formation of homocysteine from O-acetylhomoserine and bisulfide. Despite the widespread distribution of MetY, this pyridoxal 5′-phosphate–dependent enzyme remains comparatively understudied. To address this knowledge gap, we have characterized the MetY from Thermotoga maritima (TmMetY). At its optimal temperature of 70 °C, TmMetY has a turnover number (apparent kcat = 900 s−1) that is 10- to 700-fold higher than the three other MetY enzymes for which data are available. We also present crystal structures of TmMetY in the internal aldimine form and, fortuitously, with a β,γ-unsaturated ketimine reaction intermediate. This intermediate is identical to that found in the catalytic cycle of cystathionine γ-synthase (MetB), which is a homologous enzyme from the trans-sulfurylation pathway. By comparing the TmMetY and MetB structures, we have identified Arg270 as a critical determinant of specificity. It helps to wall off the active site of TmMetY, disfavoring the binding of the first MetB substrate, O-succinylhomoserine. It also ensures a strict specificity for bisulfide as the second substrate of MetY by occluding the larger MetB substrate, cysteine. Overall, this work illuminates the subtle structural mechanisms by which homologous pyridoxal 5′-phosphate–dependent enzymes can effect different catalytic, and therefore metabolic, outcomes.

Methionine is essential for all organisms. As a proteinogenic amino acid, it has roles in translation initiation, protein folding, stability, and function (1Valley C.C. Cembran A. Perlmutter J.D. Lewis A.K. Labello N.P. Gao J. Sachs J.N. The methionine-aromatic motif plays a unique role in stabilizing protein structure.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 34979-34991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Methionine residues are also sites of post-translational modification, particularly by oxidation. Methionine is the precursor of S-adenosyl methionine, which is an important intracellular carrier of methyl groups. Thus, methionine occupies a central role in the metabolic network (2Aledo J.C.

The specific features of methionine biosynthesis and metabolism in plants.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7805-7812Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), but not in animals. The first bacterial biosynthetic pathways to be studied in detail were from the model γ-proteobacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium (6Rowbury R.J. Synthesis of cystathionine and its control in Salmonella typhimurium.Nature. 1964; 203: 977-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 7Rowbury R.J. Woods D.D.

Methionine genes and enzymes of Salmonella typhimurium.Heredity. 1966; 21: 265-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In these species, two enzymes (encoded by metB and metC) are used to convert l-O-succinylhomoserine (l-OSHS) into the penultimate intermediate, homocysteine (Fig. 1). However, this trans-sulfurylation pathway is the exception, and not the rule, across the phylogenetic tree of bacteria (3Ferla M.P. Patrick W.M. Bacterial methionine biosynthesis.Microbiology. 2014; 160: 1571-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Outside of the β- and γ-proteobacteria, it is rare to use l-OSHS as the activated substrate for sulfurylation. It is far more common to use l-O-acetylhomoserine (l-OAHS) instead (9Bastard K. Perret A. Mariage A. Bessonnet T. Pinet-Turpault A. Petit J.L. Darii E. Bazire P. Vergne-Vaxelaire C. Brewee C. Debard A. Pellouin V. Besnard-Gonnet M. Artiguenave F. Médigue C. et al.Parallel evolution of non-homologous isofunctional enzymes in methionine biosynthesis.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13: 858-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The two-step trans-sulfurylation route is similarly uncommon outside of the γ-proteobacteria (3Ferla M.P. Patrick W.M. Bacterial methionine biosynthesis.Microbiology. 2014; 160: 1571-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Most bacteria carry out a one-step conversion of l-OAHS (or l-OSHS) to homocysteine or even directly to methionine (Fig. 1). This direct sulfurylation is catalyzed by acylhomoserine transferase enzymes that are the products of genes most commonly annotated as metY and sometimes as metZ (3Ferla M.P. Patrick W.M. Bacterial methionine biosynthesis.Microbiology. 2014; 160: 1571-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Confusingly, the equivalent gene is named metC in Mycobacterium species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (10Berney M. Berney-Meyer L. Wong K.W. Chen B. Chen M. Kim J. Wang J. Harris D. Parkhill J. Chan J. Wang F. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Essential roles of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine in the autarkic lifestyle of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Confusion around the sulfurylation enzymes extends beyond gene names and into their biochemistry. The enzymes of the trans-sulfurylation and direct sulfurylation routes are all homologues, and they all use pyridoxal 5ʹ-phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor. PLP-dependent enzymes catalyze a broad range of reactions in amino acid metabolism, but at the same time, they display low levels of sequence identity (12Liang J. Han Q. Tan Y. Ding H. Li J.

For example, the InterPro database (17Mitchell A.L. Attwood T.K. Babbitt P.C. Blum M. Bork P. Bridge A. Brown S.D. Chang H.Y. El-Gebali S. Fraser M.I. Gough J. Haft D.R. Huang H. Letunic I. Lopez R. et al.InterPro in 2019: Improving coverage, classification and access to protein sequence annotations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: D351-D360Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) categorizes the metY-encoded enzymes (InterPro family IPR006235) as those that utilize l-OAHS and the metZ-encoded enzymes (InterPro family IPR006234) as those that utilize l-OSHS. However, almost all metZ-encoded enzymes occur in organisms that produce l-OAHS rather than the predicted substrate l-OSHS, and no metZ-encoded enzyme has actually had its substrate preference characterized biochemically (3Ferla M.P. Patrick W.M. Bacterial methionine biosynthesis.Microbiology. 2014; 160: 1571-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). When taxonomic diversity is considered, the prevalent route for sulfurylation in bacterial methionine biosynthesis is by using a metY-encoded enzyme and bisulfide (HS−) as the sulfur source (Fig. 1) (3Ferla M.P. Patrick W.M. Bacterial methionine biosynthesis.Microbiology. 2014; 160: 1571-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). An enzyme with this activity is also likely to have been the common ancestor of all sulfurylation enzymes (18Hacham Y. Gophna U. Amir R. In vivo analysis of various substrates utilized by cystathionine γ-synthase and O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase in methionine biosynthesis.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The metY-encoded enzymes were originally classified as lyases in Enzyme Commission (EC) class 4.2.99.10 and were variously known as O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylases, O-acetylhomoserine (thiol)-lyases or O-acetylhomoserine thiolases. However, they have subsequently been reclassified as transferases (EC 2.5.1.49) with the systematic name of O-acetylhomoserine aminocarboxypropyltransferases. For simplicity, we refer to a metY-encoded enzyme as MetY. The absence of MetY from model organisms such as E. coli means it is a comparatively understudied link in the bacterial methionine biosynthesis pathway. With respect to steady-state kinetics, the BRENDA database (19Jeske L. Placzek S. Schomburg I. Chang A. Schomburg D.

To the best of our knowledge, the Corynebacterium glutamicum, Clostridioides difficile, and Clostridium novyi MetY enzymes are the only three for which a turnover number (kcat) and therefore a catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) have been reported (20Hwang B.J.

However, this enzyme is unusual because the sulfur donor is not bisulfide but instead a sulfur-carrier protein in which the C-terminal carboxylate has been modified to a thiocarboxylate.

Chem. 2003; 384: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition to their shared mechanistic aspects, MetY and MetB are also close structural homologues (23Tran T.H. Krishnamoorthy K. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. A novel mechanism of sulfur transfer catalyzed by O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase in the methionine-biosynthetic pathway of Wolinella succinogenes.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this work, we set out to investigate the determinants of specificity that distinguish MetY from MetB. In a previous study, we purified the Thermotoga maritima MetY (TmMetY; UniProt entry Q9WZY4) and showed by nonquantitative MS that it catalyzed the formation of homocysteine from l-OAHS and HS− (33Ferla M.P. Brewster J.L. Hall K.R. Evans G.B. Patrick W.M. Primordial-like enzymes from bacteria with reduced genomes.Mol. Microbiol. 2017; 105: 508-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here, we present an in-depth functional and structural study of the enzyme. We are the first to report both steady-state kinetics and structures for a MetY enzyme and also the first to describe the structure of an O-acylhomoserine-utilizing MetY. Of particular note, one of our two X-ray crystal structures fortuitously captured a reaction intermediate, shedding light on the mechanism and determinants of specificity in this widespread enzyme from a central metabolic pathway. To measure TmMetY activity, we required a robust assay for quantifying l-homocysteine. A common method for the detection of thiolated reaction products is by the reduction of Ellman’s reagent [5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid)], which can be quantified spectrophotometrically (34Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. A new and rapid colorimetric determination of acetylcholinesterase activity.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (19861) Google Scholar). However, one of the substrates in the reaction catalyzed by TmMetY is free thiol, which instantaneously saturates the colorimetric reaction and renders this method ineffective. In clinical settings, homocysteine is commonly quantified by reversed-phase HPLC. However, this method requires the additional preparation steps of thiol reduction and derivatization for absorbance- or fluorescence-based detection (35Frick B. Schröcksnadel K. Neurauter G. Wirleitner B. Artner-Dworzak E. Fuchs D. Rapid measurement of total plasma homocysteine by HPLC.Clin. Chim. Acta. 2003; 331: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36Kusmierek K. Chwatko G. Glowacki R. Bald E. Determination of endogenous thiols and thiol drugs in urine by HPLC with ultraviolet detection.J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2009; 877: 3300-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These processes present challenges for generating Michaelis–Menten kinetics parameters, such as the optimization of reduction and derivatization reactions, the potential for product loss therein, the interpretation of complex elution profiles, and poor reproducibility (37Choi C.K. Dong M.W. Sample preparation for HPLC analysis of drug products.in: Ahuja S. Dong M.W. Handbook of Pharmaceutical Analysis by HPLC. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands2005: 123-144Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These concerns prompted us to search for a homocysteine quantitation method that was better suited to analyzing enzyme kinetics. We discovered a commercial product (from Diazyme Laboratories) marketed for the determination of homocysteine concentration in human blood plasma. This kit-based reaction couples the production of homocysteine in a primary end-point reaction to the oxidation of NADH in a series of secondary reactions (Fig. S1A). This series of reactions could be monitored spectrophotometrically by a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. Critically for this study, the first stage of this discontinuous assay (i.e., the TmMetY-catalyzed formation of l-homocysteine) could be performed at physiologically relevant temperatures of up to 80 °C. The second reaction for the detection of l-homocysteine was then performed at 37 °C and the amount quantified by reference to a standard curve (Fig. S1B). With our new quantitative assay in hand, we set out to determine the pH and temperature optima for the reaction catalyzed by TmMetY. Specific activities were compared across the range of pH 5.5 to 9.0. This required the use of two different buffers to ensure buffering capacity was maintained across the pH range: MES for pH 5.5 to 7.0 and bicine for pH 7.5 to 9.0. The optimal pH was found to be 7.0 (Fig. 2A). We then checked that the activity profile was not a reflection of buffer preference by comparing enzyme activity at pH 7.0 in several different buffers including MES, bicine, Tris HCl, potassium phosphate, MOPS, and HEPES. The specific activity was marginally higher in both bicine and HEPES, so the latter was chosen for all subsequent assays as the optimal TmMetY pH of 7.0 coincides with its effective buffering range (pH 6.8–8.2, compared with pH 7.6–9.0 for bicine) (38Good N.E. Winget G.D. Winter W. Conolloy T.N. Izawa S. Singh R.M.M. Hydrogen ion buffers for biological research.Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). Of note, the optimal pH also corresponds to the pKa for dissociation of H2S into HS−. Next, we determined the optimal temperature (Topt) for activity of the enzyme. T. maritima grows at temperatures between 55 °C and 90 °C (39Huber R. Langworthy T.A. König H. Thomm M. Woese C.R. Sleytr U.B. Stetter K.O. Thermotoga maritima sp. nov. represents a new genus of unique extremely thermophilic eubacteria growing up to 90°C.Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 324-333Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar), and in culture, the Topt for growth is 80 °C (39Huber R. Langworthy T.A. König H. Thomm M. Woese C.R. Sleytr U.B. Stetter K.O. Thermotoga maritima sp. nov. represents a new genus of unique extremely thermophilic eubacteria growing up to 90°C.Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 324-333Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 40Wang Z.W.

Therefore, we expected the Topt of TmMetY would coincide with this range. Enzyme activity in our in vitro assay was found to peak at 70 °C (Fig. 2B), after which it decreased dramatically so that at 80 °C the activity was lower than at 37 °C. We observed a similar trend, and the same Topt of 70 °C, in our previous characterization of the multifunctional T. maritima cystathionine β-lyase (33Ferla M.P. Brewster J.L. Hall K.R. Evans G.B. Patrick W.M. Primordial-like enzymes from bacteria with reduced genomes.Mol. Microbiol. 2017; 105: 508-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We also monitored thermal denaturation of TmMetY using a fluorescence thermal shift assay. Protein unfolding occurred rapidly from 85 °C, with the melting temperature calculated to be 87 °C ± 1 deg. C. Having determined the optimal conditions for TmMetY activity in vitro, we next analyzed the steady-state kinetics of the reaction with respect to the native substrate l-OAHS. All previous studies on MetY enzymes (except for the bifunctional MetY/MetB from C. glutamicum) have found KM values for the second substrate, bisulfide, to be in the range of 0.05 to 1.3 mM (21Kulikova V.V.

Cloning and overexpression of the oah1 gene encoding O-acetyl-L-homoserine sulfhydrylase of Thermus thermophilus HB8 and characterization of the gene product.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1549: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we therefore fixed the bisulfide concentration at 5 mM. The enzyme exhibited apparent Michaelis–Menten kinetics with l-OAHS, at 70 °C and pH 7.0 (Fig. 2C). The apparent kcat (kcatApp) with respect to this substrate was calculated to be 900 s−1 per active site and the apparent KM (KMApp) for l-OAHS was 8 mM, giving a catalytic efficiency of kcatApp/KMApp = 1 × 105 s−1 M−1. Given the complexity of the multistep assay and the corresponding noise in the standard curves we were able to generate (e.g., Fig. S1B), we have deliberately reported these estimates at a level of precision that we believe to be justified. More precise determinations of the steady-state kinetic parameters are likely to require an alternate assay design. Despite these caveats, it is clear that the turnover number of TmMetY is significantly greater than the others that have been reported (Table 1). The apparent Michaelis constant for l-OAHS is similar to those reported for other bacterial and fungal MetY enzymes which, with the exception of the C. novyi and C. difficile MetY enzymes (Table 1), fall in the range of KM = 1.9 to 7.0 mM (20Hwang B.J.

https://openalex.org/W3162485084,"Intratumoral heterogeneity is a characteristic of glioblastomas that contain an intermixture of cell populations displaying different glioblastoma subtype gene expression signatures. Proportions of these populations change during tumor evolution, but the occurrence and regulation of glioblastoma subtype transition is not well described. To identify regulators of glioblastoma subtypes we utilized a combination of in vitro experiments and in silico analyses, using experimentally generated as well as publicly available data. Through this combined approach SOX2 was identified to confer a proneural glioblastoma subtype gene expression signature. SFRP2 was subsequently identified as a SOX2-antagonist, able to induce a mesenchymal glioblastoma subtype signature. A subset of patient glioblastoma samples with high SFRP2 and low SOX2 expression was particularly enriched with mesenchymal subtype samples. Phenotypically, SFRP2 decreased tumor sphere formation, stemness as assessed by limiting dilution assay, and overall cell proliferation but increased cell motility, whereas SOX2 induced the opposite effects. Furthermore, an SFRP2/non-canonical-WNT/KLF4/PDGFR/phospho-AKT/SOX2 signaling axis was found to be involved in the mesenchymal transition. Analysis of human tumor tissue spatial gene expression patterns showed distinct expression of SFRP2- and SOX2-correlated genes in vascular and cellular areas, respectively. Finally, conditioned media from SFRP2 overexpressing cells increased CD206 on macrophages. Together, these findings present SFRP2 as a SOX2-antagonist with the capacity to induce a mesenchymal subtype transition in glioma cells located in vascular tumor areas, highlighting its role in glioblastoma tumor evolution and intratumoral heterogeneity."

This suggests that c-Src performs a unique function in the osteoclast that cannot be compensated for by other SFKs. We aimed to identify the molecular basis of this unique role in osteoclasts and bone resorption. We found that c-Src, Lyn, and Fyn were the most highly expressed SFKs in WT osteoclasts, whereas Hck, Lck, Blk, and Fgr displayed low levels of expression. Formation of the podosome belt, clusters of unique actin assemblies, was disrupted in src−/− osteoclasts; introduction of constitutively activated SFKs revealed that only c-Src and Fyn could restore this process. To identify the key structural domains responsible, we constructed chimeric Src–Hck and Src–Lyn constructs in which the unique, SH3, SH2, or catalytic domains had been swapped. We found that the Src unique, SH3, and kinase domains were each crucial to establish Src functionality. The SH2 domain could however be substituted with Lyn or Hck SH2 domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that c-Src’s functionality is, in part, derived from an SH3–proximal proline-rich domain interaction with c-Cbl, leading to phosphorylation of c-Cbl Tyr700. These data help clarify Src’s unique functionality in the organization of the cytoskeleton in osteoclasts, required for efficient bone resorption and explain why c-Src cannot be replaced, in osteoclasts, by other SFKs.

The ubiquitously expressed rous sarcoma oncogene tyrosine kinase (Src) is important in cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration (1Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Cellular functions regulated by Src family kinases.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar). Despite its widespread expression in multiple cell types, the major phenotype of src−/− mice is osteopetrosis caused by defective osteoclast bone resorption (2Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Lowe C. Soriano P.

Invest. 1992; 90: 1622-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), suggesting that Src fulfills a unique, nonredundant function in osteoclasts. Among the Src family kinases (SFKs), only the deletion of Src results in osteopetrosis (3Lowe C. Yoneda T. Boyce B.F. Chen H. Mundy G.R. Soriano P.

Combined deficiencies of Src, Fyn, and Yes tyrosine kinases in mutant mice.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1999-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the mechanism by which Src deletion affects bone resorption is for the most part by altering a signaling pathway that governs the formation, turnover, and organization of podosomes in a peripheral belt in active osteoclasts attached to the bone (6Miyazaki T. Tanaka S. Sanjay A. Baron R. The role of c-Src kinase in the regulation of osteoclast function.Mod. Rheumatol. 2006; 16: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Some degree of redundancy may exist however within the SFK family of tyrosine kinases because src−/−;hck−/− double-KO mice are more osteopetrotic than Src-deficient mice (7Lowell C.A. Niwa M. Soriano P. Varmus H.E. Deficiency of the Hck and Src tyrosine kinases results in extreme levels of extramedullary hematopoiesis.Blood. 1996; 87: 1780-1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, deleting Lyn increases receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis, resulting in osteopenia rather than osteopetrosis, and has little effect on the activity of mature osteoclasts (8Kim H.-J. Zhang K. Zhang L. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. Faccio R. The Src family kinase, Lyn, suppresses osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These reports suggest that while some other SFKs compensate for the absence of Src in most tissues and Hck may partially compensate for Src’s absence in osteoclasts, Src is specifically and uniquely required for the function of mature osteoclasts, more specifically the organization of their cytoskeleton. Src plays a central role in integrin-mediated cell adhesion and the formation of podosomes, the specialized adhesion structures that are required for normal osteoclastic bone resorption (10Horne W.C.

Rev. 2005; 208: 106-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Src is activated downstream of αvβ3 integrin, which mediates the attachment of osteoclasts to bone matrix and contributes to the migration of osteoclasts over the bone surface and the formation of the sealing zone that surrounds and delineates the extracellular bone resorbing compartment (10Horne W.C.

Consequently, Src-deficient osteoclasts are not only unable to resorb the bone but also 50 to 60% less mobile than WT osteoclasts (15Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. DiDomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E.

Our studies also indicate that Src promotes the initiation of podosome formation, the rate of actin polymerization within podosomes, the disassembly of podosomes, and the organization of the peripheral podosome belt by phosphorylating some of the many proteins that are known to be Src substrate proteins and to regulate podosome function (14Destaing O.

All members of the SFK family have similar domain structures with four distinct domains: unique, Src homology (SH)3, SH2, and kinase (catalytic) domains (18Levinson A.D. Oppermann H. Varmus H.E.

In contrast, SH3 and SH2 domains contain conserved and specific amino acid sequences that bind to proximal proline-rich (PPR) motifs and sequences containing phosphotyrosines, respectively, on other signaling proteins to form signaling complexes. The SFK SH3 and SH2 domains also bind intramolecularly to downregulate Src/SFK kinase activity (20Pawson T. Gish G.D.

The kinase domain phosphorylates components of the signaling complexes on tyrosine residues (25Bolen J.B. Rowley R.B. Spana C. Tsygankov A.Y. The Src family of tyrosine protein kinases in hemopoietic signal transduction.FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3403-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To delineate the molecular basis for the specific role of Src in osteoclasts, we first determined the relative expression level of other Src family kinases in these cells and analyzed the effects of expressing these in src−/− osteoclasts. We found that Lyn is upregulated in src−/− osteoclasts but neither compensates for Src’s absence nor represses Src’s ability to promote cell spreading and podosome belt formation. To identify the features of Src that are the basis of the kinase’s unique role in regulating osteoclast function, we expressed chimeric Hck–Src and Lyn–Src proteins in an open conformation and determined how replacing individual Src domains by the homolog domain from these other SFKs altered osteoclast spreading and podosome belt formation. The results indicate that Src’s unique, SH3, and kinase, but not the SH2, domains are required for the specific Src functions in osteoclasts. To determine whether Src’s unique functional role in osteoclasts is only due to the particularly high Src level of expression relative to other SFKs, we first measured the expression level of all SFKs in WT osteoclasts by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Fig. 1A). Src and Lyn were more highly expressed than the other SFKs, with Lyn expression about 75% of Src expression. Fyn expression was about one third of Src expression and the expression of all the other SFKs was less than 10% of the Src level. Thus, Src, Lyn, and Fyn are the major SFKs in osteoclasts. To determine whether Src deletion affects the expression level of other SFKs, possibly attempting to compensate the absence of Src, we next measured SFK expression in src−/− osteoclasts. As shown in Figure 1A, in src−/− osteoclasts, Lyn, Hck, and Fgr were significantly upregulated. Lyn expression increased to almost 4-fold higher than the expression of Src in WT osteoclasts, and the expression of Hck increased by 10-fold, reaching the level of Lyn expression in WT osteoclasts. In contrast, expression of Fyn was significantly lower in the src−/− osteoclasts and expression of the other SFKs remained very low (Fig. 1A). Corresponding with mRNA data, protein levels of Hck and Lyn in src−/− osteoclasts were about 4- to 5-fold higher than that of WT osteoclasts (Fig. 2D, Fig. S1A). Fyn in src−/− osteoclasts was about 60 to 70% of that in WT osteoclasts (Fig. 2D, Fig. S1A). It has been reported that overexpression of Lyn suppresses osteoclast differentiation (8Kim H.-J. Zhang K. Zhang L. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. Faccio R. The Src family kinase, Lyn, suppresses osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106: 2325-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that high levels of Lyn in src−/− osteoclasts can suppress mature osteoclast function. To determine whether high levels of Lyn have a negative effect on podosome belt formation, we overexpressed constitutively active LynY487F in mature WT osteoclasts using an adenovirus system. Mature WT osteoclasts were large and multinuclear and formed podosome belts (Fig. 1, B–D). Infection with the CRE, SrcY527F, and/or LynY487F adenoviruses had little effect on tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and podosome belt formation of the WT osteoclasts. These results suggest that high levels of Lyn are not likely to lead to a disruption in actin organization. To determine which SFKs can support normal actin organization in osteoclasts, we introduced constitutively active SFKs into mature src−/− osteoclasts. Mature WT osteoclasts differentiated from spleen cells with macrophage colony-stimulating factor and RANKL spread and had a round shape (Fig. 2A). F-actin in WT osteoclasts was organized in peripheral podosome belts (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, src−/− osteoclasts were not well spread, had irregular forms (Fig. 2A), and failed to form podosome belts (Fig. 2, B and C), as previously described (14Destaing O. Sanjay A. Itzstein C. Horne W.C. Toomre D. De Camilli P. Baron R. The tyrosine kinase activity of c-Src regulates actin dynamics and organization of podosomes in osteoclasts.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As expected, infection of src−/− osteoclasts with CRE adenovirus did not affect cell shape or actin organization. Introduction of the constitutively active SrcY527F rescued the cell spreading and podosome belt formation of src−/− osteoclasts as previously reported (14Destaing O. Sanjay A. Itzstein C. Horne W.C. Toomre D. De Camilli P. Baron R. The tyrosine kinase activity of c-Src regulates actin dynamics and organization of podosomes in osteoclasts.Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 17660-17666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Interestingly, FynY528F also restored effectively the cell spreading, shape, and podosome belt formation of src−/− osteoclasts, suggesting that the failure of Fyn to compensate for the absence of Src was the consequence of low expression level (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, induction of other SFKs did not rescue podosome belt formation of src−/− osteoclasts. (Fig. 2, B–D). HckY520F fails to significantly restore the spreading and podosome belt formation in src−/− osteoclasts (Fig. 2). However, the absence of both Src and Hck results in significantly more severe osteopetrosis than the absence of Src alone (7Lowell C.A. Niwa M. Soriano P. Varmus H.E. Deficiency of the Hck and Src tyrosine kinases results in extreme levels of extramedullary hematopoiesis.Blood. 1996; 87: 1780-1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that some feature of Hck may be functionally redundant with certain Src domains. To explore the contributions of Src’s individual domains to its unique ability to promote podosome belt formation, we constructed chimeras of Src and Hck and expressed them in src−/− osteoclasts. We hypothesized that the specialized SFK binding domains, especially the SH2 and SH3 domains, could determine the specificity of Src. We first swapped the SH2 and SH3 binding domains of Hck and Src to generate two complementary chimeras with the binding domains of one SFK and the catalytic domain of the other (Fig. 3A). Both chimeras had nonspecific kinase activity with a short peptide substrate, although the activity of the chimera with the Hck kinase domain had only about half the activity of the Src kinase domain chimera (Fig. 3B). Similar data were obtained by Western blotting analysis (Fig. S2). Contrary to our hypothesis that the binding domains would provide Src’s functional specificity, we found that the Hck chimera with Hck SH2-SH3 and the Src kinase domain (H2SK) was comparable to Src itself in its ability to restore cell spreading, shape, and podosome belt formation in src−/− osteoclasts when expressed at the same expression level as HckY520F. In contrast, the Src chimera with Hck kinase domain and Src SH2–SH3 (S2HK) only partially restored cell spreading and had much less of an effect on the podosome belt formation than Src although the expression level of S2HK was almost same (Fig. 3, C–F, Fig. S3). These results suggest that the Src and Hck SH2 and SH3 domains have comparable specificity for the target proteins that mediate the localization of Src during the induction of spreading and podosome belt formation, but the kinase domains differ in their ability to phosphorylate the proteins that play key roles in these processes. Despite the high level of Lyn expression, src−/− osteoclasts do not spread to a round shape or form podosome belts. Moreover, overexpression of constitutively active Lyn in mature src−/− osteoclasts did not restore cell spreading or podosome belt formation (Fig. 2). These results suggest that Lyn is largely unable to replicate Src activity in osteoclasts. Thus, replacing individual Src domains with the corresponding Lyn domains should at least partially disable Src function. We therefore constructed eight Src-Lyn chimeras to analyze the functional role of each Src domain (Fig. 4A). Like the Src–Hck chimeras, the Src–Lyn chimeras retained kinase activity with both peptide and protein substrates although target proteins were different (Fig. 4B, Fig. S4). The replacement of either the Src kinase domain (S2LK) or the Src-binding domains (L2SK) with Lyn domains eliminated much of Src’s ability to restore spreading (Fig. 4C) or podosome belt formation (Fig. 4, D and E). The near-complete inability of the chimera with the Lyn SH2 and SH3 domains (L2SK) to promote spreading or podosome belt formation suggests that Src SH2 and/or SH3 domains are required for both activities of Src. On the other hand, the chimera of the Src SH2 and SH3 with Lyn kinase domain (S2LK) was about 10-fold more active in supporting belt formation than the complementary half-chimera, indicating that the Lyn kinase domain has some ability to phosphorylate Src target protein(s) that promote belt formation when properly localized by the Src-binding domains, but still at only 25 to 30% of the activity of full-length Src. We further analyzed the contributions of the three Src-binding domains (unique, SH3, and SH2) by replacing one or two of them with the corresponding Lyn domains (Fig. 4, B–F, Fig. S5). Replacing only the SH2 domain of Src with the Lyn SH2 (L2Src) had little effect on either spreading or belt formation. In contrast, replacing the SH3 domain of Src with Lyn SH3 (L3Src) significantly reduced both spreading and belt formation, suggesting that Src specificity in osteoclast cytoskeletal organization depends in large part upon the SH3 domain. The major molecular mechanism by which c-Src functions in osteoclasts is the phosphorylation of c-Cbl, a ubiquitin E3 ligase that regulates podosome belt formation (17Miyazaki T. Sanjay A. Neff L.

Cell. 2009; 20: 4021-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, specificity of SFK binding to c-Cbl or SFK phosphorylation of c-Cbl may explain the molecular uniqueness of c-Src. We therefore determined whether this critical interaction was based upon the specificity of Src SH3 by examining the mechanism by which c-Src interacts and phosphorylates c-Cbl. As we reported earlier (29Yokouchi M. Kondo T. Sanjay A. Houghton A. Yoshimura A. Komiya S. Zhang H. Baron R. Src-catalyzed phosphorylation of c-Cbl leads to the interdependent ubiquitination of both proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35185-35193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), coexpression of Src and c-Cbl induced c-Cbl and Src degradation, with c-Cbl levels reduced by more than 90% (Fig. 5A, Fig. S6). Fyn also induced degradation of c-Cbl by about 50% when Src was not co-overexpressed (Fig. 5A, Fig. S6). In contrast, other Src family kinases had little or no effect on c-Cbl level (Fig. 5A, Fig. S6). These results suggest that the Src-induced degradation of c-Cbl could contribute to the unique effect of Src on actin organization in osteoclasts. c-Cbl’s PPR domain contains multiple sites that bind to the Src SH3 domain (27Sanjay A. Miyazaki T. Itzstein C. Purev E. Horne W.C. Baron R.

Destaing O. Jurdic P. Dikic I. SH3P2 in complex with Cbl and src.FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, mutating the PPR motifs does not completely eliminate binding to Src (27Sanjay A. Miyazaki T. Itzstein C. Purev E. Horne W.C. Baron R. Identification and functional characterization of an Src homology domain 3 domain-binding site on Cbl.FEBS J. 2006; 273: 5442-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and it has been reported that mutating phosphorylated c-Cbl Tyr residues reduces c-Cbl’s binding to Src and other SFKs (31Feshchenko E.A. Langdon W.Y. Tsygankov A.Y. Fyn, Yes, and Syk phosphorylation sites in c-Cbl map to the same tyrosine residues that become phosphorylated in activated T cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8323-8331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To better understand the roles of c-Cbl SH3-binding and SH2-binding motifs in mediating c-Cbl’s interaction with c-Src, we made truncated fragments of the C-terminal half of c-Cbl (c-Cbl-CT) that eliminated one or more specific binding motifs (Fig. 5B) and overexpressed these five mutants with or without SrcY527F in 293 cells (Fig. 5C, Fig. S7A). The binding of the fragments to Src domains was evaluated by pulldown assays using glutathione-S-transferase (GST)–Src constructs containing Src’s entire N-terminal half (unique, SH3, and SH2 domains, Fig. 5D, Fig. S7B), SH3 domain (Fig. 5E, Fig. S7C), or SH2 domain (Fig. 5F, Fig. S7, D and E). Consistent with earlier reports, c-Cbl-CT (aa 479–906), F1 (aa 479–791, lacking the UBA domain), and F2 (aa 479–636, lacking the C-terminal phosphorylated Tyr residues and UBA domain) bound to N-terminal Src and Src SH3 in the absence of coexpressed SrcY527F, whereas F3 (aa 637–906, lacking the PPR motifs) and F4 (aa 792–906, lacking both PPR domains and phosphorylated Tyr residues) did not. Coexpressing SrcY527F to catalyze phosphorylation of the c-Cbl Tyrs increased the binding of N-terminal Src to c-Cbl-CT and F1 (and to a lesser degree F2). More importantly, Src-catalyzed phosphorylation induced the binding of N-terminal Src to F3, which lacks the SH3-binding PPR motifs, indicating that phosphorylation of one or more of the c-Cbl Tyrs creates a binding site for Src. Src-catalyzed phosphorylation had little or no effect on the binding of any of the fragments to Src SH3, suggesting that Src-catalyzed phosphorylation of c-Cbl Tyrs promoted binding to the Src SH2 domain. This was confirmed using GST-c-Src SH2 in the pull-down assay (Fig. 5F, Fig. S7E). c-Cbl CT, F1, and F3 were highly phosphorylated bound to GST-c-Src SH2 when SrcY527F was coexpressed, but no binding was observed when c-SrcY527F was absent (Fig. 5F). The binding of phosphorylated F3 was relatively weak, despite its high phosphorylation (compare the binding of CT and F3), suggesting that binding of the SH2 domain to phosphorylated c-Cbl is weak relative to the SH3–proline motif interaction. F2, which lacks the phosphorylated Tyrs, did not bind to Src SH2 whether c-SrcY527F was coexpressed or not. Three phosphorylated tyrosine residues (Tyr700, Tyr731, and Tyr774) have been reported to mediate the binding of multiple proteins to c-Cbl (32Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. c-Cbl and Cbl-b ubiquitin ligases: Substrate diversity and the negative regulation of signalling responses.Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We therefore mutated each of these residues to phenylalanine in c-Cbl F3 (Fig. 6A) and examined the effect on the binding of the Src SH2 domain. As expected, neither F3 nor the mutants bound to GST–Src [SH3/SH2] in the absence of coexpressed SrcY527F (Fig. 6B, the left side of the top panel, Fig. S8A). When SrcY527F was coexpressed with the c-Cbl F3 constructs, F3 and F3Y700F were equivalently phosphorylated and bound to GST–Src [SH3/SH2] (Fig. 6B, the right side of the top panel, Fig. S8A). In contrast, F3Y731F and F3Y774F were much significantly less phosphorylated and failed to detectably bind to GST–Src [SH3/SH2] (Fig. 6B second panel, Fig. S8B), suggesting that phosphorylation of both Tyr731 and Tyr774 can enhance c-Cbl binding to c-Src. Next, we sought to determine which domain of Src is involved in binding to phosphorylated c-Cbl F3. GST–Src SH3 domain did not bind to both nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated c-Cbl F3 (Fig. 6C, second panel). On the other hand, GST–Src SH2 bound to F3 and F3Y700F (Fig. 6C, the top panel, Fig. S8D). These results suggest that Tyr731 and Tyr774 can enhance c-Cbl binding to the c-Src SH2 domain. The Src tyrosine kinase plays an essential role in osteoclast bone resorbing activity, promoting the formation of the sealing zone and ruffled border and organization of F-actin into the peripher"
https://openalex.org/W3164259703,"In vitro studies of transcription frequently require the preparation of defined elongation complexes. Defined transcription elongation complexes (TECs) are typically prepared by constructing an artificial transcription bubble from synthetic oligonucleotides and RNA polymerase. This approach is optimal for diverse applications but is sensitive to nucleic acid length and sequence and is not compatible with systems where promoter-directed initiation or extensive transcription elongation is crucial. To complement scaffold-directed approaches for TEC assembly, I have developed a method for preparing promoter-initiated Escherichia coli TECs using a purification strategy called selective photoelution. This approach combines TEC-dependent sequestration of a biotin–triethylene glycol transcription stall site with photoreversible DNA immobilization to enrich TECs from an in vitro transcription reaction. I show that selective photoelution can be used to purify TECs that contain a 273-bp DNA template and 194-nt structured RNA. Selective photoelution is a straightforward and robust procedure that, in the systems assessed here, generates precisely positioned TECs with >95% purity and >30% yield. TECs prepared by selective photoelution can contain complex nucleic acid sequences and will therefore likely be useful for investigating RNA structure and function in the context of RNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W3163118739,"A20 is a potent anti-inflammatory protein that mediates both inflammation and ubiquitination in mammals, but the related mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we performed mass spectrometry (MS) screening, gene ontology (GO) analysis, and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory cell model to identify novel A20-interacting proteins. We confirmed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nrdp1, also known as ring finger protein 41 (RNF41), interacted with A20 in LPS-stimulated cells. Further co-IP analysis demonstrated that when A20 was knocked out, degradation-inducing K48-linked ubiquitination of inflammatory effector MyD88 was decreased, but protein interaction-mediating K63-linked ubiquitination of another inflammatory effector TBK1 was increased. Moreover, western blot experiments showed that A20 inhibition induced an increase in levels of MyD88 and phosphorylation of downstream effector proteins as well as of TBK1 and a downstream effector, while Nrdp1 inhibition induced an increase in MyD88 but a decrease in TBK1 levels. When A20 and Nrdp1 were coinhibited, no further change in MyD88 was observed, but TBK1 levels were significantly decreased compared with those upon A20 inhibition alone. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses revealed that the ZnF4 domain of A20 is required for Nrdp1 polyubiquitination. Upon LPS stimulation, the inhibition of Nrdp1 alone increased the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α but decreased IFN-β secretion, as observed in other studies, suggesting that Nrdp1 preferentially promotes the production of IFN-β. Taken together, these results demonstrated that A20/Nrdp1 interaction is important for A20 anti-inflammation, thus revealing a novel mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of A20."
https://openalex.org/W3164419060,"We investigated the radiocaesium content of nine epiphytic foliose lichens species and the adjacent barks of Zelkova serrata (Ulmaceae, ""Japanese elm"") and Cerasus sp. (Rosaceae, ""Cherry tree"") at the boundary of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station six years after the accident in 2011. Caesium-137 activities per unit area (the 137Cs-inventory) were determined to compare radiocaesium retentions of lichens (65 specimens) and barks (44 specimens) under the same growth conditions. The 137Cs-inventory of lichens collected from Zelkova serrata and Cerasus sp. were respectively 7.9- and 3.8-times greater than the adjacent barks. Furthermore, we examined the radiocaesium distribution within these samples using autoradiography and on the surfaces with an electron probe micro analyzer (EPMA). Autoradiographic results showed strong local spotting and heterogeneous distributions of radioactivity in both the lichen and bark samples, although the intensities were lower in the barks. The electron microscopy analysis demonstrated that particulates with similar sizes and compositions were distributed on the surfaces of the samples. We therefore concluded that the lichens and barks could capture fine particles, including radiocaesium particles. In addition, radioactivity was distributed more towards the inwards of the lichen samples than the peripheries. This suggests that lichen can retain 137Cs that is chemically immobilised in particulates intracellularly, unlike bark."

https://openalex.org/W3161303717,"Membrane transport proteins undergo critical conformational changes during substrate uptake and release, as the substrate-binding site is believed to switch its accessibility from one side of the membrane to the other. Thus, at least two substrate-binding intermediates should appear during the process, that is, after uptake and before the release of the substrate. However, this view has not been verified for most transporters because of the difficulty in detecting short-lived intermediates. Here, we report real-time identification of these intermediates for the light-driven outward current-generating Na+-pump rhodopsin. We triggered the transport cycle of Na+-pump rhodopsin using a short laser pulse, and subsequent formation and decay of various intermediates was detected by time-resolved measurements of absorption changes. We used this method to analyze transport reactions and elucidated the sequential formation of the Na+-binding intermediates O1 and O2. Both intermediates exhibited red-shifted absorption spectra and generated transient equilibria with short-wavelength intermediates. The equilibria commonly shifted toward O1 and O2 with increasing Na+ concentration, indicating that Na+ is bound to these intermediates. However, these equilibria were formed independently; O1 reached equilibrium with preceding intermediates, indicating Na+ uptake on the cytoplasmic side. In contrast, O2 reached equilibrium with subsequent intermediates, indicating Na+ release on the extracellular side. Thus, there is an irreversible switch in “accessibility” during the O1 to O2 transition, which could represent one of the key processes governing unidirectional Na+ transport.

Membrane transport proteins play vital roles by transporting various substances across cell membranes. The function “transportation” seems to be simple but needs strategic conformational changes. In particular, during substrate uptake and release, essential changes should occur as proposed by the alternating access model (1Jardetzky O. Simple allosteric model for membrane pumps.Nature. 1966; 211: 969-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). For substrate uptake, the protein lumen should be exposed only to the relevant side of the membrane. After substrate uptake, “accessibility switching” occurs so that the protein lumen is exposed to the other side of the membrane for substrate release. Thus, the transport cycle should contain at least two substrate-binding intermediates, both of which involve the substrate but have significantly different conformations. These consecutively appearing intermediates have been successfully identified by computational analyses for some transport proteins (2Moradi M. Enkavi G. Tajkhorshid E.

However, experimental identifications are not achieved for most proteins, reflecting the difficulty in detecting and characterizing short-lived intermediates. Here, we report the real-time identification of two substrate-binding intermediates for the light-driven Na+-pump rhodopsin (NaR). NaR belongs to the microbial rhodopsin family, a huge family of photoactive membrane proteins in unicellular microorganisms. Similar to visual rhodopsin in animal eyes, microbial rhodopsins consist of seven transmembrane helices and the chromophore retinal, which binds to a specific Lys residue via a protonated Schiff base (4Ernst O.P. Lodowski D.T. Elstner M. Hegemann P. Brown L.S. Kandori H. Microbial and animal rhodopsins: Structures, functions, and molecular mechanisms.Chem.

Biophysics of rhodopsins and optogenetics.Biophys. Rev. 2020; 12: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Upon light absorption, retinal isomerizes from the all-trans to the 13-cis state and distorts the protein conformation. This energized state of the protein is thermally relaxed to the original state via a variety of intermediates. During this cyclic reaction, called a photocycle, microbial rhodopsins perform various functions, such as ion pumps, ion channels, light sensors, and enzymes. The respective intermediates have their own “colors,” reflecting the differences in retinal configuration and its environment. This color difference is advantageous for analyzing photoreactions. When we use a laser pulse, a large amount of microbial rhodopsin simultaneously starts the photocycle. Thus, subsequent formations and decays of various intermediates can be detected by time-resolved measurements of the absorption changes. We adopted this method to analyze the NaR photocycle. NaR is the third ion pump rhodopsin widely spread in marine bacteria (7Jung K.H.

Previously, we experimentally proved that Na+ uptake and release occur during the formation and decay of the O intermediate, which appears at the longer wavelength region in the latter half of the photocycle (11Murabe K. Tsukamoto T. Aizawa T. Demura M. Kikukawa T. Direct detection of the substrate uptake and release reactions of the light-driven sodium-pump rhodopsin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2020; 142: 16023-16030Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In that study, we demonstrated well-matched time courses of two flash-induced signals, viz., Na+ concentration change because of Na+ uptake and release by NaR and absorbance change reflecting O intermediate accumulation. However, as mentioned previously, at least two O intermediates should exist involving Na+ inside the protein. We previously suggested the formation of two O intermediates based on the absorbance changes but did not perform a definitive analysis (12Kajimoto K. Kikukawa T. Nakashima H. Yamaryo H. Saito Y. Fujisawa T. Demura M. Unno M. Transient resonance Raman spectroscopy of a light-driven sodium-ion-pump rhodopsin from Indibacter alkaliphilus.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2017; 121: 4431-4437Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the NaR photocycle in detail by flash-induced absorbance changes to unravel the O intermediate substrates. Our analysis revealed that the photocycle consists of seven intermediates, including two O intermediates, O1 and O2. These O intermediates appear sequentially in the longer wavelength region and independently attain transient equilibria with other intermediates, where O1 equilibrates with the preceding intermediates, but O2 does so with the subsequent intermediate. These results indicate that accessibility switching occurs during the O1 to O2 transition. For all experiments, we used a nanodisc containing NaR to increase the clarity of the sample. Figure 1C shows the flash-induced absorbance changes at three typical wavelengths. The Na+ concentration increased from traces 1 to 4, whose respective concentrations were 10, 30, 100, and 500 mM Na+, respectively. The negative deflection at 530 nm represents the original dark state's depletion, whereas the positive deflection at other wavelengths indicates intermediate formation. The first intermediate K appears at a very fast rate. Thus, our apparatus followed the photocycle after the completion of K formation. The traces for 600 nm start with positive values (at 0.01 ms), which reflect the presence of remaining K. Concomitant to its decay, the short-wavelength intermediate appears at 410 nm. This absorption change was previously assigned to the equilibrium of the L and M intermediates (8Inoue K. Ono H. Abe-Yoshizumi R. Yoshizawa S. Ito H. Kogure K. Kandori H.

Phys. 2019; 21: 4461-4471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the red-shifted intermediate O appears at 600 nm and peaks at approximately 1 to 10 ms. As described previously, the substrate Na+ is captured and released during the formation and decay of O. Reflecting its Na+-binding state, O is not formed in the absence of Na+ (Fig. S2), whereas in the presence of Na+, O accumulation becomes prominent with increasing Na+ concentration (Fig. 1C). During Na+ uptake and release, O should make transient equilibria with its preceding and subsequent intermediates in a manner dependent on Na+ concentration. To clarify these aspects and the presence of O substrates, we analyzed the photocycle in detail. We performed global-fitting analyses for the datasets of the flash-induced absorbance changes (380–700 nm, 10 nm intervals) according to the sequential irreversible model: P0 → P1 → P2 → … → Pn → P0 (15Chizhov I. Chernavskii D.S. Engelhard M. Mueller K.H. Zubov B.V. Hess B. Spectrally silent transitions in the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle.Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2329-2345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). P0 denotes the original dark state, whereas Pi (i = 1, 2, … n) denotes the kinetically distinguishable states, which are not “true” intermediates. For many rhodopsins, several “true” intermediates are known to be connected with not only forward reactions but also reverse reactions. During the photocycle, these intermediates might reach quasi-equilibrium. In this case, individual intermediates are not kinetically distinguishable, but the equilibrium state is kinetically distinguishable. Consequently, these intermediates are involved in the same Pi state. Thus, the sequential irreversible model is the hypothetical model to probe the appearance order of “true” intermediates involved in the photocycle and the existence of reverse reactions (for details of analysis procedures, see Experimental procedures section). The number of P states “n” corresponds to the number of exponents in the multiexponential function used for the fitting analysis. Thus, we first performed fitting analyses by varying the number of exponents to determine the value of “n.” Standard deviations of the weighted residuals for the fitting analyses are shown in Figure 2A. As shown here, the decrease in standard deviations became saturated at seven exponents in the presence of any Na+ concentration. The number “seven” is relatively large compared with those for other microbial rhodopsins (16Kikukawa T. Kusakabe C. Kokubo A. Tsukamoto T. Kamiya M. Aizawa T. Ihara K. Kamo N. Demura M.

J. 2001; 81: 1600-1612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the validity of the seven exponents is supported by Figure 2B, which indicates the excellent separation of the determined decay time constants of P states (τi) and their monotonous changes with increasing Na+ concentration. For example, the decay time constants at 200 mM Na+ were 20 μs, 0.10 ms, 0.40 ms, 1.5 ms, 4.3 ms, 25 ms, and 260 ms for the P1–P7 states, respectively. Thus, we concluded that the NaR photocycle involves seven P states. The next concern is which P state contributes to O accumulation. If O can be divided into substrates, O accumulation is probably described by more than two P states. Thus, we compared the time courses of concentration changes of P states and the flash-induced absorbance change at 600 nm. The latter involves the absorbance change because of the formation and decay of O. As shown in Figure 3, O accumulations are described by P4 and P5 states at all Na+ concentrations. Thus, both states contain Na+-binding intermediates. Next, we determined the absorption spectra of P states to probe the physical intermediates involved in each P state, especially in the P4 and P5 states. The results are summarized in Figure 4. As shown, both the P4 and P5 states contain red-shifted intermediates (Fig. 4, D and E) in equilibrium with the shorter wavelength intermediates. As the Na+ concentration is increased, the equilibria commonly shift toward red-shifted intermediates. Thus, these intermediates bind Na+ and correspond to the O intermediate. However, their λmax values are clearly different. The O in P4 has λmax at approximately 590 nm, whereas another O in P5 has a λmax of approximately 570 nm. Thus, these intermediates should be assigned to different Na+-binding states. Hereafter, we call them O1 and O2, respectively. For further analysis, we deduced the absorption spectra of the physical intermediates. Here, we employed the skewed Gaussian (SG) function to simulate intermediate spectra (for details, see Experimental procedures section). The determined SG functions are plotted in Figure 5, and their parameters are listed in Table S1. As described later, we finally obtained the photocycle scheme shown in Figure 6, which involves the relationships between the P states and the physical intermediates.Figure 6Photocycle scheme deduced from this study. The inner circle indicates the sequential irreversible model used for the global fitting analysis. Along this circle, the decay time constants at 200 mM Na+ are shown. The outer circle represents the deduced “true” photocycle scheme. The gray circular sectors indicate the intermediates involved in the respective Pi states. The Na+ uptake and release timings are also indicated with the deduced dissociation constant (Kd) values for Na+. The O1 to O2 transition occurs irreversibly and corresponds to the process of accessibility switching. “L + M” indicates the simultaneous appearance of L and M, so their appearance order could not be determined. In addition to the P2–P4 states, the P5 state also contains M in a faint amount. This latter M is denoted with ML, which might be formed from O2 reflecting Na+ binding near the protonated Schiff base (for details, see text).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Of the seven P states, states P1, P6, and P7 (Fig. 4, A, F, and G) show single absorption bands independent of Na+ concentration. Thus, these states probably contain only a single intermediate. Indeed, they fitted well with a single SG function, as shown in Fig. S3. The first state, P1, should correspond to K. Meanwhile, the last state, P7, has almost the same spectrum as the dark state. Thus, P7 is a precursor of the dark state and should be named as NaR', which probably has almost the same protein conformation as the dark state. P6 contains a slightly red-shifted intermediate. We tentatively named this intermediate N. As discussed later, in the preceding P5 state, N and O2 probably attain Na+-dependent equilibrium. Thus, N seems to have a conformation whose Na+-binding site faces to the EC side. This conformation might be different from the subsequent NaR' and dark states. As mentioned previously, the dark state does not contain Na+. Thus, until the end of the photocycle, the binding site should become isolated from the medium. The P2 and P3 states have broad and similar spectra (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, they seem to contain the same intermediates in the equilibria. Here, we assumed that K remains in the P2 and P3 states and confers longer absorptions. Fig. S4 shows approximations of the remaining spectra after subtracting the contribution of K. The remaining spectra are still broad, especially for P2, and thus probably contain two intermediates L and M. For H+-pump rhodopsins, the M intermediate is known to contain the deprotonated Schiff base and, thus, it exhibits the shortest absorption band among all intermediates. For M of NaR, this deprotonation was also experimentally confirmed (20Nishimura N. Mizuno M. Kandori H. Mizutani Y. Distortion and a strong hydrogen bond in the retinal chromophore enable sodium-ion transport by the sodium-ion pump KR2.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2019; 123: 3430-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Similar to P2 and P3, a broad spectrum also appeared in P4 at 10 mM Na+ (Fig. 4D). Thus, P4 probably reflects the equilibrium between O1 and its preceding intermediates (K, L, and M), which should be associated with the Na+ uptake reaction at the CP side. Conversely, the P5 spectrum at 10 mM was relatively narrow (Fig. 4E) and close to that of N in the P6 state (Fig. 4F). Thus, P5 probably represents the equilibrium at the opposite side, where O2 is in equilibrium with the subsequent N. This equilibrium should be associated with the Na+ release reaction. The validity of this discussion was confirmed by following the decompositions of the P2–P5 spectra. Here, we first analyzed the P4 and P5 spectra at 400 and 500 mM. In both states, the spectra at two Na+ concentrations were almost the same (Fig. 4, D and E). Thus, the shifts of the equilibria seem to be almost saturated above 400 mM. Fig. S5A supported this view. From the P4 and P5 spectra (Fig. 4, D and E), we picked up the absorbance values at λmax of O1 (590 nm) and O2 (570 nm), respectively. These absorbance values are plotted in Fig. S5A against Na+ concentration. The increases in absorption values became slower at higher Na+ concentrations and almost saturated above 400 mM. Reflecting these changes, the P4 and P5 spectra above 400 mM Na+ appear to contain O1 and O2 as the respective main components, whereas at approximately 430 nm, both spectra also contain faint contributions from another intermediate. We tentatively assigned this intermediate as M, although its appearance in P5 seems unusual, as discussed later. We deduced the spectra of M, O1, and O2, as shown in Fig. S5B. Here, we first averaged the respective spectra at 400 and 500 mM Na+. The two resultant spectra were fitted simultaneously using the following equation:fM⋅SGM+fO1⋅SGO1+fO2⋅SGO2(1) where SGM, SGO1, and SGO2 represent the SG functions for the respective absorption bands and are shared between two spectra in the fitting analysis. The terms fM, fO1, and fO2 are the coefficients to describe their respective amplitudes. As mentioned previously, O1 and O2 do not appear simultaneously in the P4 and P5 states. Thus, fO2 was fixed to zero for P4 fitting, whereas fO1 was fixed to zero for P5 fitting. The best-fit curves simulated the spectra well (Fig. S5B). As described previously, P2 and P3 commonly contain K, L, and M. Thus, the spectra of P2 and P3 at all Na+ concentrations were fitted simultaneously by the following equation:fK⋅SGK+fL⋅SGL+fM⋅SGM(2) Here, we assumed that SGM is identical to that in Equation 1. Moreover, we determined SGK from the analysis of P1 (Fig. S3A). Thus, in the fitting using Equation 2, we determined SGL and the three amplitude coefficients, fK, fL, and fM. The best-fit results are summarized in the two left columns in Figure 7. The P2 spectra show a distinct Na+ concentration dependence (Fig. 7A). As shown in the lower panels (Fig. 7, B and C), this dependence reflects the decreases in the K and L fractions and an increase in the M fraction with increasing Na+ concentration. As mentioned previously, we performed time-resolved detection of Na+ concentration changes because of Na+ uptake and release by photolyzed NaR (11Murabe K. Tsukamoto T. Aizawa T. Demura M. Kikukawa T. Direct detection of the substrate uptake and release reactions of the light-driven sodium-pump rhodopsin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2020; 142: 16023-16030Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Consequently, we detected the Na+-concentration change at only the formation and decay of O, indicating that no uptake and release of Na+ should occur until the formation of O. Thus, the Na+ dependence in P2 might originate from the binding of Na+ in the unphotolyzed state. The interface between NaR monomers is known to hold Na+ (21Gushchin I. Shevchenko V. Polovinkin V.

This Na+ binding might also affect the equilibria in P2, although the reported dissociation constant (10–50 mM) (8Inoue K. Ono H. Abe-Yoshizumi R. Yoshizawa S. Ito H. Kogure K. Kandori H.

The P3 spectra also show a small Na+-concentration dependence (Fig. 7D), which reflects the decrease in the L fraction and concomitant increase in the K fraction (Fig. 7, E and F). These changes might also originate from the Na+ binding in the dark state. However, this binding seems to be weak. Thus, there might exit another site to bind Na+. Such a binding site was also suggested in a previous study (26Nakamizo Y. Fujisawa T. Kikukawa T. Okamura A. Baba H. Unno M. Low-temperature Raman spectroscopy of sodium-pump rhodopsin from indibacter alkaliphilus: Insight of Na+ binding for active Na+ transport.Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2021; 23: 2072-2079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As described previously, L and M appear simultaneously in P2 and remain together until P4. Thus, they are shown as “L + M” in Figure 6, reflecting the difficulty in determining the order of their appearance. The P4 and P5 spectra at lower Na+ concentrations (10–200 mM) remain to be analyzed. For P4 spectra, we first tried to fit them by assuming the involvement of M, L, and O1. However, the sum of these three SG functions could not simulate the spectra well (Fig. S6A). Better fitting results were obtained by assuming an additional contribution of K (Fig. S6B). The fitting results for all Na+ concentrations are summarized in Figure 7, G–I, where the sum of four SG functions (SGK, SGL, SGM, and SGO1) was adopted. For the P5 state, N is probably involved at low Na+ concentrations, as mentioned previously. Thus, we tried to fit the P5 spectra by assuming the involvement of M, O2, and N. As a result, well-fitted curves were obtained, as summarized in Figure 7, J–L. In both fitting analyses for P4 and P5 spectra, we determined only the amplitude coefficients of the respective intermediates (Fig. 7, I and L) because we had already determined all SG functions for the intermediates. As described previously, the P4 spectra were fitted well with the contributions of O1 and the preceding intermediates of K, L, and M. Thus, O1 is probably accessible to the CP side and attains equilibrium with the preceding intermediates reflecting Na+ uptake at the CP side. Consistently, the amplitude coefficient of O1 is increased by the elevation of Na+ concentration, whereas the other coefficients decrease, as shown in Figure 7I. Conversely, to describe the P5 spectra, we had to consider the contribution of M in addition to O2 and N. However, the main components are O2 and N. Thus, P5 is probably a “counter state” of P4; in P5, O2 is probably accessible to the EC side and attains equilibrium with the subsequent N, reflecting the release of Na+ at the EC side. Their amplitude coefficients also show consistent changes (Fig. 7L); the value for O2 is increased, whereas the value for N is decreased by the elevation of Na+ concentration. As mentioned previously, the appearance of M in P5 seems unusual. M is the intermediate before the formation of O1, and O1 is not involved in P5. Thus, M should not appear in P5, which should contain the intermediates after O1. The amplitude coefficient of M is also somewhat unusual because this coefficient is almost constant even with varying Na+ concentration (Fig. 7L). Thus, M in P5 might be a different intermediate from M in P2–P4. Hereafter, we use “ML” to denote the “late” M involved in P5. For “early” M in P2–P4, a vital role is considered for Na+ passage over the Schiff base region. At M, the Schiff base is deprotonated and thus seems to allow Na+ passage (10Inoue K. Konno M. Abe-Yoshizumi R. Kandori H. The role of the NDQ motif in sodium-pumping rhodopsins.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2015; 54: 11536-11539Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Kato H.E. Inoue K. Abe-Yoshizumi R. Kato Y. Ono H. Konno M. Hososhima S. Ishizuka T. Hoque M.R. Kunitomo H. Ito J. Yoshizawa S. Yamashita K. Takemoto M. Nishizawa T. et al.Structural basis for Na+ transport mechanism by a light-driven Na+ pump.Nature. 2015; 521: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). At subsequent O1 and O2, the Schiff base should be protonated and results in red-shifted spectra. Conversely, upon ML formation, the Schiff base should deprotonate again, similar to the early M. We infer that this deprotonation might be a side reaction after Na+ binding near the protonated Schiff base. At O2, Na+ binding might lower the pKa of the Schiff base and subsequently induce deprotonation. Reflecting this view, ML is shown in Figure 6 as an intermediate, which is not involved in the main pathway and formed from O2 as the branching reaction. The amplitude coefficients are proportional to the respective mole fractions. Thus, we determined the dissociation constants (Kd) of O1 and O2 for Na+. Here, we fitted their amplitude coefficients (Fig. 7, I and L) using the following equation:fO=fmax⋅[Na+]/(Kd+[Na+])(3) where fmax and [Na+] denote the maximum amplitude coefficient and Na+ concentration, respectively. The best-fit curves shown in Figure 7, I and L were obtained at Kd values of 61 mM for O1 and 39 mM for O2. For ideal transporters, the substrate affinities should be strong at the uptake side but weak at the release side. In contrast, NaR has a relatively strong affinity at the release side compared with the uptake side. This disadvantage might be overcome by the irreversible transition from O1 to O2. As shown previously, these intermediates do not appear in the same P state, indicating that equilibrium is not achieved. Thus, the O1 to O2 transition seems to be irreversible, which might assure one-way Na+ transfer even in transport against an electrochemical gradient across the membrane. The mechanism for the irreversible transition is an interesting subject to be solved in future studies. In addition to O1 → O2, the transitions after P5 also seem to be important. At the P5 state, N attains Na+-dependent equilibrium with O2. However, at the next P6 state, N solely appears at any Na+ concentration, implying that the Na+-binding site is isolated from the EC medium. Thus, the N in P6 might have a different conformation from the N in P5. This conformational change might also be a critical process for Na+ transport, even at a stronger affinity in the P5 state. Moreover, two other irreversible transitions, N → NaR' (P6 → P7) and NaR' → NaR (P7 → P0), probably assure the completion of the translocation cycle and contribute to one-way Na+ transport. The molecular events during these transitions should be clarified in future investigations. In this study, we analyzed the details of the NaR photocycle by using flash-induced absorbance changes. Consequently, O1 and O2 were identified as Na+-binding intermediates. They appear immediately after Na+ uptake and just before Na+ release. Thus, “accessibility switching” should occur during the O1 to O2 transition. To drive active transport, the switch process should involve strategic conformational changes, whose details should be clarified in future investigations."

Asparagine-linked glycosylation (N-glycosylation) of proteins is one of the most common covalent posttranslational protein modifications in eukaryotes.

The N-linked glycans fulfill a multitude of functions, such as regulating and controlling protein folding and intracellular trafficking or defining interactions at the cell surface (2Helenius A.

The modified asparagine residue is part of the consensus sequon N-X-(S/T). OST binds both the acceptor protein and the donor lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) and catalyzes the formation of a glycosidic bond between the amide nitrogen of the asparagine side chain and the C1 carbon of the reducing end N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue of the oligosaccharide. High-resolution structures and biochemical studies on the bacterial OST, PglB from Campylobacter lari, propose mechanisms for peptide and LLO binding, amide activation, and catalysis (6Lizak C.

In animals, plants, and fungi, OST is a multi-subunit protein complex in which the STT3 protein is the conserved catalytic subunit containing the active site. Stt3p is homologous to the single-subunit OST enzymes found in some bacteria (e.g., PglB from C. lari), archaea (e.g., AglB from Pyrococcus furiosus), and eukaryotic kinetoplastids (e.g., STT3 from Leishmania major and Trypanosoma brucei) (12Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. An evolving view of the eukaryotic oligosaccharyltransferase.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 47R-62RCrossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Many residues essential for OST function are highly conserved, and the superposition of the substrate-bound structures of PglB to the structure of the yeast Stt3p reveals that the active sites of Stt3 and PglB are very similar (13Wild R. Kowal J. Eyring J. Ngwa E.M. Aebi M. Locher K.P.

Kovach A. Li H. The atomic structure of a eukaryotic oligosaccharyltransferase complex.Nature. 2018; 555: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The key catalytic residues that bind the peptide and LLO substrates in the substrate-bound PglB structures are conserved in the yeast Stt3p and located at the same positions with respect to both substrates and the coordinating metal ion (6Lizak C. Gerber S. Numao S. Aebi M. Locher K.P. X-ray structure of a bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase.Nature. 2011; 474: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 10Napiorkowska M. Boilevin J.

Biol. 2017; 24: 1100-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Despite the same reaction mechanism, major differences in the substrate specificities of OSTs from different organisms are reported. In most eukaryotes, the LLO substrate is large and contains the GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 oligosaccharide, but smaller glycan substrates exist (1Schwarz F. Aebi M. Mechanisms and principles of N-linked protein glycosylation.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2011; 21: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 15Samuelson J. Banerjee S. Magnelli P. Cui J.

It also appears that the transferred oligosaccharides are shorter in prokaryotic protein glycosylation. In terms of the polypeptide substrate, the N-X-(S/T) sequon requirement remains the same for all OSTs, yet animals, plants, and fungi have a wider range of protein substrates and a larger number of glycosylation sites modified in their proteomes (1Schwarz F.

Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 3376-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This increase in glycosylated sites correlates with an increase in OST complexity through the acquisition of additional subunits. It is thought that the additional noncatalytic subunits enhance glycosylation efficiency of the catalytic STT3 protein by facilitating protein and LLO substrate binding (1Schwarz F. Aebi M. Mechanisms and principles of N-linked protein glycosylation.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2011; 21: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 12Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. An evolving view of the eukaryotic oligosaccharyltransferase.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 47R-62RCrossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The prototypic OST complex from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is composed of the eight subunits Ost1p, Ost2p, Ost4p, Ost5p, Stt3p, Swp1p, Wbp1p, and either Ost3p or Ost6p (12Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. An evolving view of the eukaryotic oligosaccharyltransferase.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 47R-62RCrossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Ost3p and Ost6p are nonessential homologous oxidoreductases that assemble as the last subunit into separate OST complexes, resulting in two isoforms of yeast OST that coexist (22Spirig U. Bodmer D. Wacker M. Burda P. Aebi M.

Multicellular animals and plants have an additional layer of complexity in that they express two different OST complexes that contain one of the two Stt3 paralogs, Stt3A and Stt3B (25Kelleher D.J.

The Stt3A complex associates directly with the translocon via the subunit DC2 and performs cotranslational glycosylation, whereas the Stt3B complex incorporates an oxidoreductase subunit instead of DC2 and performs posttranslocational glycosylation (13Wild R.

Locher K.P. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of human oligosaccharyltransferase complexes OST-A and OST-B.Science. 2019; 366: 1372-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the yeast OST, an Stt3B-type OST, the oxidoreductases Ost3p or Ost6p are incorporated, equivalent to the mutually exclusive incorporation of the TUSC3 and MagT1 oxidoreductase subunits in mammalian Stt3B complexes (31Ramirez A.S.

Gilmore R. Oxidoreductase activity is necessary for N-glycosylation of cysteine-proximal acceptor sites in glycoproteins.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 206: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, while nearly all organisms that express multi-subunit OSTs encode an oxidoreductase subunit (OST3 homolog) (12Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. An evolving view of the eukaryotic oligosaccharyltransferase.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 47R-62RCrossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), two functional homologs of oxidoreductases appear to be present in all vertebrates and some fungi, suggesting an important function of such redundancy (33Schulz B.L.

Cell Proteomics. 2009; 8: 357-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Ost3p and Ost6p are both oxidoreductases that can interact with the polypeptide substrate and are thought to slow down the oxidative folding of the glycoprotein substrate to transiently improve accessibility of available glycosylation sequons and increase glycosylation efficiency (34Schulz B.L. Stirnimann C.U. Grimshaw J.P. Brozzo M.S. Fritsch F. Mohorko E. Capitani G. Glockshuber R. Grutter M.G. Aebi M.

Indeed, the high-resolution structures of the yeast and the mammalian Stt3B OST show that this subunit not only directly interacts with the catalytic subunit, Stt3p, but its thioredoxin domain is also positioned right across from the Stt3p active site (13Wild R. Kowal J. Eyring J. Ngwa E.M. Aebi M. Locher K.P.

In yeast, Ost3p- and Ost6p-containing complexes have different peptide substrate preferences in vivo, and the Ost3p-containing complex (OST3 complex) is required for efficient glycosylation of a larger subset of proteins than the Ost6p-containing complex (OST6 complex) (34Schulz B.L.

To understand the differences between the OST3 and OST6 complexes, we characterized the substrate specificities and enzyme kinetics of the two OST isoforms in vitro. We found that the two complexes had similar affinities to short, synthetic peptide and LLO substrates but differed significantly in their catalytic efficiency. The two isoforms of the yeast OST complex that contain either of the functional homologs, Ost3p or Ost6p, were purified separately from strains expressing only one type of complex by deleting either OST6 or OST3 and overexpressing the desired subunit (OST3 or OST6, respectively) to ensure the assembly of complete complexes in the cell (22Spirig U. Bodmer D. Wacker M. Burda P. Aebi M. The 3.4-kDa Ost4 protein is required for the assembly of two distinct oligosaccharyltransferase complexes in yeast.Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1396-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Schwarz M.

Insertion of a 1D4 epitope tag at the C-terminus of the Ost4p subunit in these strain backgrounds allowed for a very efficient purification of complete OST complexes of a single isoform, as shown previously for determining the structure of the yeast OST (13Wild R. Kowal J. Eyring J. Ngwa E.M. Aebi M. Locher K.P. Structure of the yeast oligosaccharyltransferase complex gives insight into eukaryotic N-glycosylation.Science. 2018; 359: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Silver staining of purified OST complexes showed that all eight subunits were present and either Ost3p or Ost6p was solely incorporated into each respective complex (Fig. 1A). Both complexes also ran as single monodispersed complexes in size-exclusion chromatography and had a very similar size (Fig. 1B). Aside from the presence of either Ost3p or Ost6p, the only other difference observed between the purified OST isoforms was that the OST6 complex contained hypoglycosylated subunits (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the glycosylation site occupancy of the OST complex glycoproteins Stt3p, Wbp1p, and Ost1p by mass spectrometry confirmed that the OST6 complex was generally less efficiently glycosylated than the OST3 complex, but the Stt3p N539 glycosite was fully glycosylated in both OST complexes (Fig. 1C). Both Wbp1p glycosylation sites were fully modified in the OST3 complex, but their site occupancy was reduced in the OST6 complex, particularly that of Wbp1p N60 (reduced by 50%). Regarding the Ost1p glycosylation sites, only Ost1p N99 was fully glycosylated in the OST3 complex and the occupancies of Ost1p N99 and N217 were only slightly reduced in the OST6 complex, but not to the same extent as that observed for the Wbp1p glycosites. The glycan structures at each glycosylation site were determined by mass spectrometry. We found glycan heterogeneity at each site analyzed, but the site-specific glycan structure profile was very similar in both OST3 and OST6 complexes (Fig. 1D). In agreement with our understanding of the yeast glycan modification pathway in the ER and Golgi (40Xu C. Ng D.T. Glycosylation-directed quality control of protein folding.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 742-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the most abundant glycan structure on Stt3p N539, Wbp1p N60, and Ost1p N217 was identified as Man8GlcNAc2, confirming a previous report on Stt3p N539 (41Li G. Yan Q. Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. Lennarz W.J. Studies on the N-glycosylation of the subunits of oligosaccharyl transferase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1864-1871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The glycan profile of Wbp1p N332 showed that it carried either Man8GlcNAc2 or Man7GlcNAc2 structures. Ost1p N99 carried either Man8GlcNAc2 or Man9GlcNAc2 structures, but we also detected some larger glycans with up to ten hexose units (Fig. 1D). OST activity was determined using a short peptide labeled with the TAMRA (tetramethylrhodamine) fluorophore and synthetic LLO analogs with two GlcNAc residues (chitobiose) as the sugar moiety, as used previously (13Wild R. Kowal J. Eyring J. Ngwa E.M. Aebi M. Locher K.P.

Incubation of these synthetic substrates with purified yeast OST resulted in the formation of a fluorophore-labeled glycopeptide product (Fig. 2A). We detected and quantified the formation of glycopeptide product using reverse phase UPLC (ultra performance liquid chromatography) (43Naegeli A. Michaud G. Schubert M. Lin C.W. Lizak C. Darbre T.

Chem. 2014; 289: 24521-24532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) instead of a gel-based visualization of glycopeptide formation (Fig. 2B). The peak corresponding to the earlier-eluting glycopeptide increased with reaction time, and peak integration allowed an accurate and sensitive quantification of product formation. A quantitative analysis of the peptide substrate specificity of the OST3 complex in vitro was first performed using the fluorescently labeled hexapeptide TAMRA-DANYTK-NH2 as the acceptor peptide (44Schwarz F. Fan Y.Y. Schubert M. Aebi M. Cytoplasmic N-glycosyltransferase of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is an inverting enzyme and recognizes the NX(S/T) consensus sequence.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 35267-35274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The initial reaction velocity was measured at various peptide concentrations and a fixed synthetic LLO concentration (Fig. 2C). The data were fitted according to Michaelis–Menten kinetics and apparent KM and kcat values were derived (Table 1). Saturation of the peptide substrate could not be reached, but the high apparent KM of around 200 μM indicated that the short peptide used was a rather poor substrate. To obtain a more optimal peptide substrate for the yeast OST, we screened a library of peptide sequences containing a glycosylation sequon derived from a list of efficiently glycosylated yeast proteins in vivo (37Poljak K. Selevsek N. Ngwa E. Grossmann J. Losfeld M.-E. Aebi M. Quantitative profiling of N-linked glycosylation machinery in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2018; 17: 18-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (Table S1). The screen was performed by adding unlabeled synthetic peptides as a competitor substrate to in vitro reactions containing the fluorescently labeled TAMRA-DANYTK. Some peptides slightly inhibited the turnover of the labeled TAMRA-DANYTK peptide, while Peptide 5 (ADTYANATSDVL) inhibited the reaction by 50% (Fig. 2D). To directly show that this peptide sequence was indeed a better acceptor substrate than TAMRA-DANYTK, we measured the initial turnover of TAMRA-labeled Peptide 5 (TAMRA-ADTYANATSDVL) and a shorter version of Peptide 5 of only six amino acid residues (TAMRA-YANATS). Fluorophore-labeled Peptide 5 was glycosylated 1.5 times faster than TAMRA-DANYTK and the short version was glycosylated 14 times faster (Table S2). Direct quantitative analysis using the TAMRA-YANATS peptide as the substrate (Fig. 2E) revealed a 3.5-fold lower apparent KM and a 3.5-fold higher maximal initial turnover rate (Table 1): TAMRA-YANATS was over ten times more specific to the yeast OST3 complex than TAMRA-DANYTK. For further experiments, the TAMRA-YANATS peptide substrate was used.Table 1Kinetic parameters for peptide and LLO substrates with OST3 and OST6 complexesPeptide parametersKM (μM)kcat (min−1)kcat/KM (min-1 μM−s1)OST3 complexTAMRA-DANYTK201.0 ± 51.33.9 ± 0.60.02TAMRA-YANATS55.6 ± 6.514.5 ± 0.70.26OST6 complexTAMRA-YANATS44.8 ± 5.72.3 ± 0.20.05Synthetic LLO (GlcNAc2-PP-Lipid) parametersLipid nameLipid lengthOST3 complexCitronellylC10n.d.n.d.n.d.FarnesylC1567.9 ± 6.71.7 ± 0.10.02CitronellylnerylC2020.6 ± 0.69.9 ± 0.060.48CitronellylfarnesylC2512.5 ± 2.34.5 ± 0.30.36OST6 complexCitronellylnerylC2025.5 ± 1.71.9 ± 0.010.07TAMRA, tetramethylrhodamine.n.d. = activity not detected with TAMRA-DANYTK acceptor substrate.The apparent KM and kcat values were determined from data shown in Figures 2, C and E, 3B, and 5, C and D.

This mobile CTD intersubunit interface harbors many disease-associated mutations. However, the mechanisms of action of these mutations and the role of CTD in channel function are not well understood. Here, we assessed the impact of CTD disease-associated mutations P4902S, P4902L, E4950K, and G4955E on Ca2+- and caffeine-mediated activation of RyR2. The G4955E mutation dramatically increased both the Ca2+-independent basal activity and Ca2+-dependent activation of [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2. The P4902S and E4950K mutations also increased Ca2+ activation but had no effect on the basal activity of RyR2. All four disease mutations increased caffeine-mediated activation of RyR2 and reduced the threshold for activation and termination of spontaneous Ca2+ release. G4955D dramatically increased the basal activity of RyR2, whereas G4955K mutation markedly suppressed channel activity. Similarly, substitution of P4902 with a negatively charged residue (P4902D), but not a positively charged residue (P4902K), also dramatically increased the basal activity of RyR2. These data suggest that electrostatic interactions are involved in stabilizing the CTD intersubunit interface and that the G4955E disease mutation disrupts this interface, and thus the stability of the closed state. Our studies shed new insights into the mechanisms of action of RyR2 CTD disease mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3163894148,"Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), the catalytically active form of vitamin B6, plays a pivotal role in metabolism as an enzyme cofactor. PLP is a very reactive molecule and can be very toxic unless its intracellular concentration is finely regulated. In Escherichia coli, PLP formation is catalyzed by pyridoxine 5’-phosphate oxidase (PNPO), a homodimeric FMN-dependent enzyme that is responsible for the last step of PLP biosynthesis and is also involved in the PLP salvage pathway. We have recently observed that E. coli PNPO undergoes an allosteric feedback inhibition by PLP, caused by a strong allosteric coupling between PLP binding at the allosteric site and substrate binding at the active site. Here we report the crystallographic identification of the PLP allosteric site, located at the interface between the enzyme subunits and mainly circumscribed by three arginine residues (Arg23, Arg24, and Arg215) that form an “arginine cage” and efficiently trap PLP. The crystal structure of the PNPO–PLP complex, characterized by a marked structural asymmetry, presents only one PLP molecule bound at the allosteric site of one monomer and sheds light on the allosteric inhibition mechanism that makes the enzyme-substrate–PLP ternary complex catalytically incompetent. Site-directed mutagenesis studies focused on the arginine cage validate the identity of the allosteric site and provide an effective means to modulate the allosteric properties of the enzyme, from the loosening of the allosteric coupling (in the R23L/R24L and R23L/R215L variants) to the complete loss of allosteric properties (in the R23L/R24L/R21L variant).

Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) acts as cofactor for over 150 enzymes (1Percudani R. Peracchi A. A genomic overview of pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent enzymes.EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 2Percudani R. Peracchi A. The B6 database: A tool for the description and classification of vitamin B6-dependent enzymatic activities and of the corresponding protein families.BMC Bioinformatics. 2009; 10: 273Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) involved in a number of metabolic pathways such as the synthesis, transformation, and degradation of amines and amino acids; supply of one carbon units; transsulfuration; synthesis of tetrapyrrolic compounds (including heme) and polyamines; and biosynthesis and degradation of neurotransmitters. In the cell, PLP is supplied to apoenzymes through either biosynthesis or recycling of B6 vitamers coming from the environment and protein turnover. The latter route is the only one available in organisms that cannot synthesize PLP, such as humans, and they obtain it through a salvage pathway (Fig. 1) catalyzed by the enzymes pyridoxal kinase, pyridoxine 5’-phosphate oxidase (PNPO; EC 1.4.3.5), and either specific or nonspecific phosphatases (3di Salvo M.L. Contestabile R. Safo M.K. Vitamin B(6) salvage enzymes: Mechanism, structure and regulation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1814: 1597-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). By using FMN as cofactor, PNPO catalyzes the oxidation of both pyridoxine 5’-phosphate (PNP) and pyridoxamine 5’-phosphate to PLP, reducing molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. With the Escherichia coli PNPO (ePNPO), the specificity constant for PNP is 50-fold higher than that for pyridoxamine 5’-phosphate (4Zhao G. Winkler M.E. Kinetic limitation and cellular amount of pyridoxine (pyridoxamine) 5'-phosphate oxidase of Escherichia coli K-12.J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 883-891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli, which synthesizes PLP through the so-called DXP-dependent pathway, ePNPO (encoded by the pdxH gene) plays the dual role of salvage pathway enzyme and of last enzyme in PLP biosynthesis (Fig. 1). This is the reason why the reaction catalyzed by ePNPO is a key point in PLP homeostasis. We have recently demonstrated (5Barile A. Tramonti A. di Salvo M.L. Nogués I. Nardella C. Malatesta F. Contestabile R. Allosteric feedback inhibition of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 15593-15603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) that ePNPO undergoes an allosteric feedback inhibition by PLP, through a mechanism in which binding of substrate at the active site and binding of PLP at an allosteric site negatively affect each other to a large extent (Fig. 2A). Such a strong allosteric coupling is also reflected in the lack of catalytic competence of the enzyme–PNP–PLP ternary complex (PES in Fig. 2A) and in the lack of capability by the enzyme–PLP complex (PE, in which PLP is bound at the allosteric site) to bind a second PLP molecule at the active site (at least in the range of PLP concentration used in kinetics measurements). Since binding of PLP at the allosteric site takes place with higher affinity than binding at the active site, PLP binding at the active site of the free enzyme does not occur. PLP allosteric inhibition is also observed with human PNPO (6Barile A. Nogués I. di Salvo M.L. Bunik V. Contestabile R. Tramonti A. Molecular characterization of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase and its pathogenic forms associated with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 13621Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). However, in this case the coupling between the allosteric site and the active site is weaker, so that the PES complex maintains a partial catalytic activity and PLP can also bind at the active site, forming an enzyme complex with two PLP molecules (PEP in Fig. 2B). The PLP allosteric site of ePNPO most likely corresponds to the secondary “PLP tight binding site” previously revealed by other authors (7Yang E.S. Schirch V. Tight binding of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to recombinant Escherichia coli pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) when they observed that, if the enzyme is incubated with PLP and then passed through a size exclusion chromatography (SEC) column, it retains PLP. This observation is due to the fact that PLP binds tightly at a secondary site, distinct from the active site, as demonstrated by a quadruple ePNPO variant whose active site is impaired and that preserves this property (5Barile A. Tramonti A. di Salvo M.L. Nogués I. Nardella C. Malatesta F. Contestabile R. Allosteric feedback inhibition of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 15593-15603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the cell, PLP tightly bound to this secondary site of ePNPO is protected from the environment where, owing to the high reactivity of its aldehyde group, it would readily combine with all sorts of amines and thiols present in the cell; at the same time, it can be transferred to PLP-dependent apoenzymes, suggesting that ePNPO may play a role in the intracellular PLP delivery process (7Yang E.S. Schirch V. Tight binding of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to recombinant Escherichia coli pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of ePNPO (Protein Data Bank [PDB] code: 1G79), obtained from crystals soaked in a solution containing a large concentration of PLP (40 mM), revealed a putative secondary PLP-binding site located at the protein surface, about 11 Å from the active site (8Safo M.K. Musayev F.N. di Salvo M.L. Schirch V. X-ray structure of Escherichia coli pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase complexed with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate at 2.0 A resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, so far the real correspondence of this binding site to the PLP tight binding site has not been experimentally confirmed. In this crystal structure, in which PLP is also bound at the active site, PLP at the secondary site is present in two positions, with an occupancy ratio of 0.7 and 0.3, respectively. In the higher occupancy position, the PLP ring is sandwiched between the side chains of Phe177 and Lys145, the pyridine nitrogen interacts with Asn84, and the phosphate group interacts with the amino group of Lys145 (8Safo M.K. Musayev F.N. di Salvo M.L. Schirch V. X-ray structure of Escherichia coli pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase complexed with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate at 2.0 A resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1). PLP in the lower occupancy position has a much weaker interaction with the protein and might result from crystal packing (8Safo M.K. Musayev F.N. di Salvo M.L. Schirch V. X-ray structure of Escherichia coli pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase complexed with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate at 2.0 A resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate, through site-directed mutagenesis experiments, that this putative site is not involved in the tight, allosteric binding of PLP. On the other hand, we employed a quadruple ePNPO variant (K72I/Y129F/R133L/H199A), with an impaired active site, to obtain a crystal structure of the enzyme in which PLP is bound at a novel secondary site. We show that this coincides with the allosteric PLP tight binding site. The actual involvement of the putative secondary site identified by previous crystallographic studies (8Safo M.K. Musayev F.N. di Salvo M.L. Schirch V. X-ray structure of Escherichia coli pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase complexed with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate at 2.0 A resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in the allosteric binding of PLP was tested through site-directed mutagenesis. A double variant (K145A/F177A) and two triple variants (N84A/K145A/F177A and N84W/K145A/F177A) of ePNPO (Fig. S1) were produced and characterized. Initially, these variant forms were analyzed with respect to their structure, thermal stability, and catalytic properties, to confirm that the introduced replacements had not significantly altered the native structure of the enzyme. Far-UV CD spectra (Fig. S2) indicated that no substantial alterations in the secondary structure were caused by the variations. Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) measurements were carried out to determine and compare melting temperature (Tm) values of variant and wildtype enzymes. The obtained denaturation curves (Fig. S3A) were fitted to a sigmoidal equation (Equation 1) to obtain Tm values. The wildtype enzyme shows a Tm of 70.0 °C ± 0.04 deg. C. The double variant form shows a similar Tm value, whereas the melting temperature of the triple variants is about 2 °C lower (Table 1). These results indicate that the variations did not drastically alter the overall structure of the enzyme.Table 1Parameters obtained from the characterization of ePNPO variantsEnzyme formTm (°C)aDetermined in Tris buffer from kinetic analysis.KM (μM)aDetermined in Tris buffer from kinetic analysis.kCAT (s−1)bDetermined from fluorimetric PLP binding equilibrium measurements.KDPLP (μM)cDetermined from PLP retention measurements.PLP (%)Wildtype70.0 ± 0.041.6 ± 0.30.25 ± 0.030.15 (5)69 ± 19K145A/F177A70.9 ± 0.052.4 ± 0.50.17 ± 0.010.47 ± 0.0672 ± 8N84A/K145A/F177A66.7 ± 0.053.2 ± 0.10.07 ± 0.020.36 ± 0.0573 ± 10N84W/K145A/F177A66.6 ± 0.063.1 ± 0.20.05 ± 0.010.33 ± 0.0773 ± 19R23L70.0 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.70.09 ± 0.020.58 ± 0.1238 ± 11R215L69.0 ± 0.092.6 ± 0.80.05 ± 0.021.28 ± 0.2222 ± 7R23L-R24L71.1 ± 0.042.1 ± 0.40.19 ± 0.031.00 ± 0.0930 ± 8R23L/R215L68.9 ± 0.033.2 ± 0.70.05 ± 0.021.18 ± 0.1718 ± 9R23L-R24L-R215L68.0 ± 0.053.4 ± 0.20.09 ± 0.011.03 ± 0.1819 ± 3a Determined in Tris buffer from kinetic analysis.b Determined from fluorimetric PLP binding equilibrium measurements.c Determined from PLP retention measurements. Open table in a new tab The catalytic properties of the ePNPO variants were analyzed in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, at 37 °C, using PNP as substrate. In these conditions, the produced PLP readily forms an aldimine complex with Tris, whose absorbance at 414 nm is followed to determine the initial velocity of the PNPO reaction (9Kwon O. Kwok F. Churchich J.E. Catalytic and regulatory properties of native and chymotrypsin-treated pyridoxine-5-phosphate oxidase.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22136-22140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in Tris buffer PLP does not accumulate in the solvent and does not inhibit the enzyme activity by binding at the allosteric site (5Barile A. Tramonti A. di Salvo M.L. Nogués I. Nardella C. Malatesta F. Contestabile R. Allosteric feedback inhibition of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 15593-15603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Initial velocity data as a function of substrate concentration were analyzed using the Michaelis–Menten equation, determining kCAT and KM values compared in Table 1. Although KM values obtained with the variant enzymes are similar to that of wildtype ePNPO, kCAT values are somewhat lower; in particular, in the case of the triple N84W/K145A/F177A variant, kCAT is about five times lower than that of wildtype ePNPO. Nevertheless, it is evident that the variations did not perturb the functional properties of the enzyme. Binding of PLP to ePNPO variants was also analyzed using the spectrofluorometric method previously employed for the wildtype enzyme (5Barile A. Tramonti A. di Salvo M.L. Nogués I. Nardella C. Malatesta F. Contestabile R. Allosteric feedback inhibition of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 15593-15603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), which is based on the resulting increase of FMN fluorescence emission. As we have previously demonstrated (5Barile A. Tramonti A. di Salvo M.L. Nogués I. Nardella C. Malatesta F. Contestabile R. Allosteric feedback inhibition of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 15593-15603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), PLP does not bind at the active site of wildtype ePNPO, most probably because binding at the allosteric site, which takes place with higher affinity, causes a conformational change that prevents binding at the active site. Therefore, the fluorimetric method only reveals binding of PLP at the allosteric site. PLP binding curves obtained with ePNPO variants (Fig. S5A) were fit to the quadratic Equation 2 (see Experimental procedures section), obtaining dissociation constant (KD) values (Table 1) that are moderately higher (0.33–0.47 μM) than that previously reported for wildtype ePNPO (0.15 μM) (5Barile A. Tramonti A. di Salvo M.L. Nogués I. Nardella C. Malatesta F. Contestabile R. Allosteric feedback inhibition of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 15593-15603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This result is inconsistent with a role for the mutated residues in PLP binding at the allosteric site. It is known by previous experiments on wildtype ePNPO that, when the protein is incubated with PLP and then passed through an SEC column, it retains PLP tightly bound to it (7Yang E.S. Schirch V. Tight binding of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to recombinant Escherichia coli pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 377: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This happens even when the active site is unable to bind PLP as a consequence of multiple variations (5Barile A. Tramonti A. di Salvo M.L. Nogués I. Nardella C. Malatesta F. Contestabile R. Allosteric feedback inhibition of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 15593-15603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), demonstrating that PLP binds tightly at an allosteric site. All ePNPO variants (100 μM) were incubated with an equimolar amount of PLP. Then, they were passed through an SEC column and the stoichiometry of protein-bound PLP with respect to protein subunits was determined. The percentage of protein-bound PLP was 72 ± 8, 73 ± 10, and 73 ± 19, with the K145A/F177A, N84A/K145A/F177A and N84W/K145A/F177A ePNPO variants, respectively (Table 1). Such values are similar to that obtained with the wildtype enzyme (69 ± 19%), strongly suggesting that the putative secondary PLP-binding site indicated by previous crystallographic studies does not correspond to the allosteric tight binding site. As explained in the introduction, a crystal structure of ePNPO in which PLP is bound at both the active site and a secondary site has been previously reported by other authors (8Safo M.K. Musayev F.N. di Salvo M.L. Schirch V. X-ray structure of Escherichia coli pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase complexed with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate at 2.0 A resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This structure was obtained by soaking the native crystals in a highly concentrated solution of PLP (40 mM). Under these conditions, it would be expected that PLP binds to the high-affinity allosteric site, the secondary site found by Safo and collaborators (8Safo M.K. Musayev F.N. di Salvo M.L. Schirch V. X-ray structure of Escherichia coli pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase complexed with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate at 2.0 A resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the active site; therefore, it is surprising that the high-affinity allosteric site had not been revealed in previous crystallographic studies, unless the allosteric site was occluded by crystal packing. We carried out several cocrystallization trials with wildtype ePNPO and PLP in different conditions; however, we either did not obtain crystals or obtained crystals in which PLP was bound at the active site only. Therefore, we decided to change strategy and use a variant form of ePNPO in which the active site is impaired and not able to bind PLP. We recently showed that an ePNPO quadruple variant (K72I/Y129F/R133L/H199A; ePNPOqm), which has a drastically reduced capability to bind PNP (and therefore PLP) at the active site, is still able to bind PLP at the allosteric site (5Barile A. Tramonti A. di Salvo M.L. Nogués I. Nardella C. Malatesta F. Contestabile R. Allosteric feedback inhibition of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase from Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 15593-15603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We crystallized this quadruple variant in both the absence of PLP (ePNPOqm) in P31 2 1 space group and presence of PLP (PLP-ePNPOqm) in P61 space group. The three-dimensional structures of both crystal forms were solved (Table 2). The final model of ePNPOqm was refined to 1.56 Å resolution; the asymmetric unit contains a 212-residue subunit (residues 7–218; the entire polypeptide chain is made by 218 residues), one FMN molecule, two sulphate ions, one phosphate ion, and 174 water molecules. The second subunit of the dimer was generated by the crystallographic 2-fold axis. The final model of the PLP-bound ePNPOqm (PLP-ePNPOqm) was refined to 2.42 Å resolution; the asymmetric unit contains a 353-residue dimer (residues/chain: 17/A–126/A; 176/A–218/A; 14/B–166/B; 170/B–218/B), one FMN molecule per subunit, one sulphate ion in subunit A, one PLP molecule with 0.81 occupancy in subunit B, and 45 water molecules. The quadruple mutant conserves the structural elements of the wildtype protein: five alpha helices, numbered from H1 to H5, and ten β strands. In addition, in the PLP-free ePNPOqm the N-terminal region is also visible, folded in an additional α helix (H0, residues 5–18). The subunit structure can be described, as reported by Safo et al., (10Safo M.K. Mathews I. Musayev F.N. di Salvo M.L. Thiel D.J. Abraham D.J. Schirch V. X-ray structure of Escherichia coli pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase complexed with FMN at 1.8 A resolution.Structure. 2000; 8: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in terms of two domains.The core of the larger domain is represented by a seven-stranded and a four-stranded antiparallel β sheet, structurally joined by the S4 strand (110–120) that is part of both sheets. The β sheets core region is flanked by H1 (and H0 in PLP-free ePNPOqm) on one side and H2 on the opposite side. The smaller domain packs adjacent to the β-barrel core and helix H2 and is made up by the three remaining α helices, H3, H4, and H5 (154–166) (Fig. 3A). In the PLP-ePNPOqm model, the subunit A backbone displays a major break of 49 residues (comprising residues 127–175), corresponding to the ePNPO smaller domain comprising the H3, H4, and H5 helices, whereas only a minor break of three residues is present in subunit B (residues 167–169), which could not be modelled because of the lack of information from the FO – FC map (Fig. 3B). No PLP is present at the active site of either structures (Fig. 3, A and B), although PLP-ePNPOqm was crystallized in the presence of excess PLP (see Experimental procedures section for details); this is evidently a consequence of the engineered active site variants (Fig. 3, C and D). In contrast to the symmetrical ePNPOqm structure, the PLP-ePNPOqm is the first ever characterized structure of the enzyme crystallized in a P61 space group, in which the dimer is asymmetric. This structural discrepancy resides in the major chain break contained in subunit A, comprising a portion of H3 (residues 123–130) and the whole H4 and H5 (residues 135–143 and 153–166, respectively) regions. The disorder of these elements in subunit A seems to occur as a consequence of PLP binding in a surface cleft, placed in part at the interface between subunits A and B, mainly circumscribed by three arginine residues (Arg23, Arg24, Arg215) belonging to subunit B and acting as an electrostatic “Arg cage” for PLP. The three Arg residues efficiently trap PLP in the cavity (Fig. 4, A and B). The binding driving force is represented by the phosphate group, as often occurs in PLP-binding proteins (11Denesyuk A.I. Denessiouk K.A. Korpela T. Johnson M.S. Functional attributes of the phosphate group binding cup of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which is capable of establishing polar interactions with the amino groups of the side chains and backbone of Arg23, Arg215, and Arg24, respectively. In addition, a small network of hydrogen bonds takes place between Arg23 and the PLP phosphate group by means of a bridging water molecule, HOH419, whose role is apparently to contribute to stabilizing PLP lodging in the cavity; this effect is enhanced by the pyridine ring, able to coordinate Arg24 and Arg215 via the deprotonated nitrogen atom. This Arg cage was previously identified by Safo and collaborators (8Safo M.K. Musayev F.N. di Salvo M.L. Schirch V. X-ray structure of Escherichia coli pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase complexed with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate at 2.0 A resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (PDB code: 1G76, 1G77, 1G78, 1G79) as a binding site for a unique phosphate ion; the PLP phosphate group and this phosphate ion appear to bind in a very similar fashion, as only a slight displacement of Arg23 is detectable in the same binding site. The comparison between the corresponding Fo–Fc omit maps (contoured at 2.5σ) (Fig. 4A; Fig. S4) allows us to exclude the presence of a phosphate ion rather than PLP in this cavity of subunit B of the PLP-ePNPOqm structure. The superimposition of PLP-ePNPOqm and ePNPOqm revealed important differences between the two structures, highlighting the structural change induced by PLP binding to the allosteric site. Indeed, PLP binding causes the dismantling of a specific pattern of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions anchoring H5 of subunit A to a short neighboring protein segment made of residues 192 to 200 of subunit B (“H-unc”; Fig. 5, A and B). In this structure of ePNPOqm without PLP, the interactions between two key residues of H5 (subunit A; Arg153 and Glu157) and residues Glu195, Leu198, and Asp200 placed on the 192 to 200 helix (subunit B) are particularly important to maintain these structural elements linked together and correctly folded (Fig. 5A). Binding of PLP to subunit A of ePNPOqm causes a displacement of the H-unc structural element (Cα of Glu195 moves 7.6 Å apart from its previous position), thereby disrupting the interactions of this structural element with H5 of subunit A, which loses its structure together with H3 and H4 (Fig. 5B). The displacement of H-unc upon PLP binding causes also the movement of Arg197 (placed on H-unc), which, in the wildtype ePNPO structure (PDB code: 1G76), contributes to the PLP binding to the catalytic site, establishing electrostatic interactions with both its aldehyde and hydroxyl groups. As shown in Figure 5C, in the ePNPOqm structure, the Arg197 displays a position similar to that of the wildtype protein. Upon PLP binding to the Arg-cage site, Arg197 shifts and its side chain rotates about 180° around its Cα with respect to its original position (Fig. 5C). The large conformational change of the 190 to 200 segment, and in particular the displacement of Arg197, alters the structure of the active site and therefore the affinity for both PLP and substrate, and as a consequence reduces the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Since the amino acid residues Arg23, Arg24, and Arg215 are crucial for the interaction with PLP in the PLP-ePNPOqm crystal structure, single variant forms (R23L and R215L) as well as two double (R23L/R24L and R23L/R215L) and a triple (R23L/R24L/R215L) ePNPO variants were produced through site-directed mutagenesis and characterized. All variants showed far-UV CD spectra superimposable to that of the wildtype ePNPO (Fig. S2), indicating that the variations did not affect the secondary structure of the protein. Data obtained from DSF measurements showed that all variants are quite similar to the wildtype enzyme with respect to thermal stability (Fig. S3B) (Table 1). With these variants, enzyme activity measurements yielded KM and kCAT values that, in some cases, are different with respect to those of wildtype ePNPO (Table 1); however, they testify to substantial preservation of the enzyme functional properties. PLP binding was analyzed through the same spectrofluorometric method described above (Fig. S5B). Noticeably, the PLP binding properties of all variants were found to be substantially altered, as shown by KD values that in some cases are 7- to 10-fold higher than that of the wildtype enzyme (Table 1). When ePNPO variants were incubated with PLP and passed through an SEC column, a considerably low percentage of PLP was retained: only 18% to 19% (with respect to protein subunits) in the case of the R23L/R215L and R23L/R24L/R215L variants, in comparison with the 70% value obtained with wildtype ePNPO (Table 1). As mentioned above, kinetic measurements of PNP oxidation into PLP catalyzed by PNPO are usually carried out in Tris buffer to prevent PLP accumulation and enzyme inhibition (9Kwon O. Kwok F. Churchich J.E. Catalytic and regulatory properties of native and chymotrypsin-treated pyridoxine-5-phosphate oxidase.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22136-22140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies carried out by our group showed that, when the reaction is carried out in Hepes buffer, a complex kinetics of PLP formation is observed as a consequence of PLP allosteric inhibition (5Barile A.

Initially, upon mixing enzyme with PNP, the velocity of product formation decreases, resulting in a deceleration phase caused by the accumulation of PLP in the solvent, binding of PLP at the allosteric site, and the consequent onset of enzyme inhibition (Fig. 6A). The first deceleration phase is followed by a slower, approximately linear production of PLP. This compl"

CREBH is upregulated in the liver under conditions of overnutrition, and mice globally lacking the gene (CREBH−/−) are highly susceptible to diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. The net protective effects of CREBH have been attributed in large part to the activities of fibroblast growth factor (Fgf)-21 (Fgf21), a target gene that promotes weight loss, improves glucose homeostasis, and reduces hepatic lipid accumulation. To explore the possibility that activation of the CREBH–Fgf21 axis could ameliorate established effects of high-fat feeding, we generated an inducible transgenic hepatocyte-specific CREBH overexpression mouse model (Tg-rtTA). Acute overexpression of CREBH in livers of Tg-rtTA mice effectively reversed diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. These changes were associated with increased activities of thermogenic brown and beige adipose tissues in Tg-rtTA mice, leading to reductions in fat mass, along with enhanced insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Genetically silencing Fgf21 in Tg-rtTA mice abrogated the CREBH-mediated reductions in body weight loss, but only partially reversed the observed improvements in glucose metabolism. These findings reveal that the protective effects of CREBH activation may be leveraged to mitigate diet-induced obesity and associated metabolic abnormalities in both Fgf21-dependent and Fgf21-independent pathways.

On the balance, CREBH upregulation and activation appears to be protective against the metabolic complications of diet-induced obesity in mice.

These activities of Fgf21 appear to be largely responsible for the beneficial effects of activating CREBH in the setting of overnutrition. Although CREBH is upregulated in liver and Fgf21 production is increased by obesity, the capacity of the CREBH–Fgf21 axis to mitigate weight gain and obesity-related metabolic disorders is limited under natural conditions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that acute overexpression of CREBH in liver could reverse established obesity, IR, and hepatic steatosis. We generated an inducible transgenic hepatocyte-specific tetracycline-regulated element (TRE)-CRE-reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) overexpression mouse model (Tg-rtTA). As expected, doxycycline induced CREBH and Fgf21 expression in a dose-dependent manner (8Lee J.H. Giannikopoulos P. Duncan S.A. Wang J. Johansen C.T. Brown J.D. Plutzky J. Hegele R.A. Glimcher L.H.

Hepatic CREBH overexpression resulted in potent reductions in body weight and adiposity, improvements in glucose homeostasis, and reversal of hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet (HFD)–fed mice. Indicative of both Fgf21-dependent and Fgf21-independent mechanisms, these beneficial effects were largely but not completely reversed upon genetic silencing of Fgf21. Taken together, these findings highlight that the CREBH activation could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy in the management of obesity and associated metabolic disorders. Whereas activation of the CREBH–Fgf21 axis protects mice from HFD-induced obesity, IR, and hepatic steatosis (6Park J.G. Xu X. Cho S. Hur K.Y. Lee M.S. Kersten S. Lee A.H.

Liver-enriched transcription factor CREBH interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α to regulate metabolic hormone FGF21.Endocrinology. 2014; 155: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the current study was designed to explore whether its activation would reverse these disorders once established. Male mice harbored single copies of the transgenes CAG-Lox-stop-Lox-rtTA3 (rtTA) and albumin-Cre (Cre) in the absence (Control) or the presence (Tg-rtTA) of a single copy of the transgene CREBH (Fig. S1A). Removal of a loxP-flanked polyadenylation signal cassette by Cre-dependent expression driven by the albumin promoter enabled strong cytomegalovirus enhancer, chicken beta-actin promoter and rabbit beta-globin splice acceptor site-driven hepatocyte-specific rtTA expression. Hepatocyte-specific expression of rtTA in turn promoted TRE-mediated CREBH expression in a doxycycline-dependent manner. The mRNA abundance of Crebh and associated target genes (Fgf21 and apolipoprotein A-IV [ApoA-IV]) were increased in Tg-rtTA mice in a doxycycline-dependent manner (Fig. S1B). At a doxycycline concentration of 1 mg/ml in the drinking water, there was no evidence of hepatotoxicity as evidenced by a lack of elevations in plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities (data not shown) (22Dow L.E.

Conditional reverse tet-transactivator mouse strains for the efficient induction of tre-regulated transgenes in mice.PLoS One. 2014; 9e95236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and this concentration was chosen for further studies. Compared with Control mice, the mRNA abundance of Crebh in livers of Tg-rtTA mice was increased 1.8-fold, and protein abundance of nuclear CREBH was increased 16-fold (Fig. S1C). Accordingly, the mRNA abundance of the CREBH target genes (Fgf21 and cell death–inducing DFFA-like effector C (Cidec)) were increased in livers of Tg-rtTA mice (Fig. S1, D and E). Although KiSS-1 metastasis suppressor (Kiss1) has been reported to be a CREBH target gene that drives Fgf21-independent regulation of glucose metabolism (13Satoh A. Han S. Araki M. Nakagawa Y.

Plasma Fgf21 was increased by 16-fold in Tg-rtTA mice after 3 weeks of doxycycline treatment, and this was sustained at 6 weeks (Fig. S1G).

Whereas no genotypic differences in body weight were observed prior to doxycycline treatment, body weights of Tg-rtTA mice decreased by 10% within 2 weeks and remained constant for the remainder of the 6-week period (Fig. 1A). This reduction in body weight was attributable to a 29% decrease in fat mass relative to Control mice (Fig. 1B). Histological analysis revealed an increased abundance of adipocytes with multilocular lipid droplets resembling brown adipocytes in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) of Tg-rtTA mice, with similar increases in cell densities observed in brown adipose tissue (BAT) (Fig. 1C). Activating CREBH in Tg-rtTA mice similarly increased expression of the browning markers uncoupling protein-1 and ELOVL fatty acid elongase 3 in both iWAT and BAT (Fig. 1D). In the absence of changes in food intake (Fig. 1E), Tg-rtTA mice exhibited increased total energy expenditure, including both the light and dark cycles (Fig. 1F), which reflected increases in values of both O2 consumption (VO2) and CO2 release (VCO2) (Fig. 1G) without changes in values of the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (Fig. 1H). There were no genotypic differences in total physical activity (Fig. 1I). Taken together, these findings were indicative that weight loss could be attributed primarily to increased energy expenditure in Tg-rtTA mice owing to thermogenesis. Blood glucose concentrations prior to doxycycline treatment were comparable between genotypes (Fig. 2A). However, within 2 weeks of doxycycline treatment, blood glucose concentrations dropped by 15.9% in Tg-rtTA mice compared with Control mice and were sustained up to 6 weeks. Plasma insulin levels prior to doxycycline treatment were also comparable between genotypes and decreased by 42.1% in Tg-rtTA mice relative to Control mice at 6 weeks (Fig. 2B). Following 6 weeks of doxycycline treatment, Tg-rtTA mice were sensitized to insulin (Fig. 2C) and exhibited increased glucose tolerance compared with Control mice (Fig. 2D). Accordingly, insulin-stimulated phosphorylated AKT serine 473 protein levels were increased in iWAT and livers of Tg-rtTA mice without changes in total AKT protein levels (Fig. 2E). These data indicate that the CREBH exerts potent effects on glucose metabolism in Tg-rtTA mice. Neither genotypic differences were observed in liver weights (Fig. 2F) or histology (Fig. 2G) nor were there changes in the plasma activities of ALT and AST (Fig. 2H). Enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin responsiveness in Tg-rtTA mice were in keeping with the increased metabolic activities of thermogenic brown and beige adipose tissues. Next, we examined whether the metabolic effects of the CREBH–Fgf21 axis could reverse HFD-induced obesity, IR, and hepatic steatosis in Tg-rtTA mice. After HFD feeding for 6 weeks, mice were administered doxycycline in the drinking water in order to activate hepatic CREBH overexpression. The mRNA abundance of Crebh in livers of Tg-rtTA mice was increased 1.7-fold, and the protein abundance of nuclear CREBH was increased 16-fold (Fig. S3A). The mRNA abundance of the CREBH target genes (Fgf21 and Cidec) were also increased in livers of Tg-rtTA mice (Fig. S3, B and C). As observed in chow-fed mice, no genotype-dependent differences in the mRNA abundance of hepatic Kiss1 were observed (Fig. S3D). Plasma Fgf21 was increased by 16-fold in Tg-rtTA mice after 3 weeks of doxycycline treatment and was sustained at 6 weeks (Fig. S3E). While initially comparable between genotypes, ApoA-IV levels were increased in the plasma of Tg-rtTA mice by 6 weeks (Fig. S3F). Prior to doxycycline treatment, Control and Tg-rtTA mice exhibited comparable rates of weight gain upon HFD feeding (Fig. 3A). However, within 4 weeks of doxycycline treatment, body weights of Tg-rtTA mice decreased by 10%, which could be explained by a 29% reduction in fat mass compared with Control mice (Fig. 3B) in the absence of changes in food intake (Fig. 3C). Expression levels of uncoupling protein-1 and ELOVL fatty acid elongase 3 were increased in both iWAT and BAT of Tg-rtTA mice (Fig. 3D). Tg-rtTA mice exhibited increases in total energy expenditure (Fig. 3E) that were attributable to increased values of VO2 and VCO2 during both the light and dark cycles (Fig. 3F) without changes in RER values (Fig. 3G). There were also no genotypic-dependent changes observed in physical activity (Fig. 3H). As observed in chow-fed mice, these findings suggest that mitigation of HFD–induced obesity in Tg-rtTA mice is primarily attributable to increased thermogenesis. Prior to doxycycline treatment during HFD feeding, blood glucose levels were comparable between genotypes. Within 2 weeks of initiating doxycycline treatment, blood glucose levels dropped by 19% in Tg-rtTA mice compared with Control mice, which were sustained at 6 weeks (Fig. 4A). Insulin concentrations were comparable between genotypes before doxycycline treatment but were reduced by 78% in Tg-rtTA mice by 3 weeks and sustained at 6 weeks (Fig. 4B). Compared with Control mice, Tg-rtTA mice exhibited increased insulin sensitivity (Fig. 4C) and glucose tolerance (Fig. 4D). In previous studies, rodent models of diet-induced hepatic steatosis have been associated with impaired CREBH function (6Park J.G. Xu X. Cho S. Hur K.Y. Lee M.S. Kersten S. Lee A.H. CREBH-FGF21 axis improves hepatic steatosis by suppressing adipose tissue lipolysis.Sci. Rep. 2016; 627938Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 7Kim H. Mendez R. Zheng Z. Chang L. Cai J.

Liver-enriched transcription factor CREBH interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α to regulate metabolic hormone FGF21.Endocrinology. 2014; 155: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Despite comparable liver sizes (Fig. 4E), Tg-rtTA mice exhibited reduced lipid accumulation by histology (Fig. 4F) and hepatic concentrations of triglycerides (Fig. 4G). In agreement with our previous studies utilizing CREBH−/− mice (6Park J.G. Xu X. Cho S. Hur K.Y. Lee M.S. Kersten S. Lee A.H. CREBH-FGF21 axis improves hepatic steatosis by suppressing adipose tissue lipolysis.Sci. Rep. 2016; 627938Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we did not observe genotypic differences in the mRNA abundance of hepatic genes related to fatty acid oxidation, lipolysis, lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, inflammation, or fibrosis (Fig. S4). Collectively, these studies suggest that activation of CREBH in liver is sufficient to reverse established resistance to diet-induced obesity, IR, and hepatic steatosis. Finally, we tested whether the effects of hepatic CREBH overexpression were primarily attributable to upregulation of Fgf21. Consistent with this possibility, reductions in blood glucose, body weight, and fat mass in Tg-rtTA mice were observed in concert with genotypic increases in plasma concentrations of Fgf21 in Tg-rtTA mice compared with Control mice (Fig. 5A). To investigate the mechanistic contribution of Fgf21 in Tg-rtTA mice, we crossed Tg-rtTA mice to Fgf21−/− mice to generate Tg-rtTA;Fgf21−/− mice. Prior to doxycycline treatment, comparable plasma concentrations of Fgf21 and ApoA-IV were observed in Control, Tg-rtTA, Fgf21−/−, and Tg-rtTA;Fgf21−/− mice (Fig. 5B). Following 6 weeks of doxycycline treatment, CREBH potently increased plasma Fgf21 levels by 18-fold in Tg-rtTA mice relative to Control, Fgf21−/−, and Tg-rtTA;Fgf21−/− mice. By contrast, genetically silencing Fgf21 in Tg-rtTA mice had no impact on the plasma concentrations of the CREBH target gene ApoA-IV in Tg-rtT"

Porphyrins, due to their amphipathic nature, spontaneously associate into different nanostructures, but very little is known about the cytotoxic effects of these porphyrin nanostructures. Previously, we demonstrated the unique ability of fluorescent biological porphyrins, including protoporphyrin-IX (PP-IX), to cause organelle-selective protein aggregation, which we posited to be a major mechanism by which fluorescent porphyrins exerts their cytotoxic effect. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that PP-IX-mediated protein aggregation is modulated by different PP-IX nanostructures via a mechanism that depends on their oxidizing potential and protein-binding ability. UV–visible spectrophotometry showed pH-mediated reversible transformations of PP-IX nanostructures. Biochemical analysis showed that PP-IX nanostructure size modulated PP-IX-induced protein oxidation and protein aggregation. Furthermore, albumin, the most abundant serum protein, preferentially binds PP-IX dimers and enhances their oxidizing ability. PP-IX binding quenched albumin intrinsic fluorescence and oxidized His-91 residue to Asn/Asp, likely via a previously described photo-oxidation mechanism for other proteins. Extracellular albumin protected from intracellular porphyrinogenic stress and protein aggregation by acting as a PP-IX sponge. This work highlights the importance of PP-IX nanostructures in the context of porphyrias and offers insights into potential novel therapeutic approaches.

Protoporphyrin-IX (PP-IX) is nature’s template for several essential biomolecules including heme, chlorophyll, coenzyme F430 (in methanogenic bacteria), and vitamin B12 (1Dayan F.E. Dayan E.A.

The PP-IX macrocycle consists of four pyrrole rings connected by methene bridges and two ionizable propioniate side chains. The highly conjugated macrocycle with 18 π-electrons confers PP-IX with distinct UV-visible absorbance and fluorescence properties (2Gotardo F. Cocca L.H.Z. Acunha T.V. Longoni A. Toldo J.

We posit that this proteotoxic property of porphyrins is a major mechanism for tissue damage in porphyrias that involve fluorescent porphyrin accumulation. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that PP-IX-mediated protein aggregation is modulated by PP-IX speciation into selective supramolecular structures that lead to differential oxidizing potential and protein binding. PP-IX speciation results in distinct UV–visible and fluorescence emission signatures (3Scolaro L.M. Castriciano M. Romeo A. Patanè S. Cefalì E. Allegrini M.

UV–visible and fluorescence spectra were collected by diluting freshly prepared PP-IX stock solutions in the indicated buffers (Fig. 1, A and B). In 100 mM HCl, PP-IX exists as monomers, characterized by the sharp Soret band at 409 nm (Fig. 1A, Table 1). At pH 4.5, PP-IX monomers form H-aggregates (higher-order structures), characterized by a broad Soret band with shoulders at 356 and 466 nm. At pH 9 and in 100 mM NaOH, PP-IX exists exclusively as dimers, as judged from the characteristic Soret peak at 380 nm. Notably, the absorbance spectrum at pH 7.4 shows features of both pH 4.5 and 9, displaying a broad Soret band with slightly red-shifted shoulders (379 and 469 nm) compared with the pH 4.5 spectrum (Fig. 1A, Table 1). This suggests that at pH 7.4, PP-IX consists of a mixture of higher-order aggregates and dimers. In addition to the changes in the Soret band, changes in the Q-bands in the 500–700 nm region were observed. In 100 mM HCl, where the four pyrrole nitrogens are expected to be protonated, two Q-bands are observed (Table 1). The number of Q bands increases to 3 (pH 4.5, 7.4) and 4 (pH 9) as the extent of protonation decreases (Table 1).Table 1Summary of UV-vis and fluorescence spectral features of different PP-IX nanostructuresAbsorbance peaks (nm)Fluorescence peaks (nm)PP-IX speciationSoretQ4Q3Q2Q1[NaOH], 100 mM381516554579633630, 687DimerpH 9384517555587640641, 685pH 7.4379–469-542595648631, 670Dimer, higher-order structurespH 4.5356, 466-539597647662, 720Higher-order structures[HCl], 100 mM409-556597-610, 665MonomerpH 9+Emp408507541581632638, 702pH 7.4+Emp408508541580633638, 702pH 4.5+Emp408505543579635639, 703BSA+PP-IX, pH 4.5355, 469-539597649638, 684BSA+PP-IX higher-order structuresBSA+PP-IX, pH 7.4391516553585629642, 683BSA+PP-IX dimerBSA+PP-IX, pH 9391509553576627642, 682BSA+PP-IX dimerBSA+PP-IX, Emp406504539585629636, 700MonomerThe table shows the absorbance and fluorescence peaks from the plots shown in Figure 1, A, B, and E, and Figure 4, A–D. Open table in a new tab The table shows the absorbance and fluorescence peaks from the plots shown in Figure 1, A, B, and E, and Figure 4, A–D. Fluorescence emission spectra of the different PP-IX species (Fig. 1B) revealed that significant fluorescence quenching is associated with higher-order aggregates of PP-IX. Thus, at pH 4.5, PP-IX displays a minimal fluorescence signal compared with pH 7.4 and 9 (Fig. 1B). We also observed that pH-induced PP-IX speciation is reversible (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, the higher-order PP-IX stru ctures observed at pH 4.5 converted to a mixture of higher-order structures and dimers (pH 7.4) and then dimers (pH 9) as the pH is increased, albeit conversion is incomplete (Fig. 1C, see shoulder indicated by arrow). The transition in the reverse direction (dimers → higher-order structures) was observed when the pH 9 PP-IX solution at was progressively acidified to pH 7.4, then 4.5 (Fig. 1D). Earlier we had reported that PP-IX induces protein aggregation in buffers containing detergents (e.g., Empigen BB, NP-40) (36Saggi H. Maitra D. Jiang A. Zhang R. Wang P. Cornuet P. Singh S. Locker J.

TAZ has been shown to interact with transcription factors in the nucleus, but when phosphorylated, translocates to the cytoplasm and is degraded through proteasomes. Here, we identified a compound TAZ inhibitor 4 (TI-4) that shifted TAZ localization to the cytoplasm independently of its phosphorylation. We used affinity beads to ascertain a putative target of TI-4, chromosomal segregation 1 like (CSE1L), which is known to be involved in the recycling of importin α and as a biomarker of cancer malignancy. We found that TI-4 suppressed TAZ-mediated transcription in a CSE1L-dependent manner. CSE1L overexpression increased nuclear levels of TAZ, whereas CSE1L silencing delayed its nuclear import. We also found via the in vitro coimmunoprecipitation experiments that TI-4 strengthened the interaction between CSE1L and importin α5 and blocked the binding of importin α5 to TAZ. WWTR1 silencing attenuated CSE1L-promoted colony formation, motility, and invasiveness of human lung cancer and glioblastoma cells. Conversely, CSE1L silencing blocked TAZ-promoted colony formation, motility, and invasiveness in human lung cancer and glioblastoma cells.

The transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) (TAZ is widely used but as its official gene symbol is WWTR1 (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee [HGNC] ID: HGNC 24042; Entrez Gene 25937), we used TAZ and WWTR1 in this article for the protein [NP001161750.1] and the gene, respectively) was first identified as a protein that binds to 14-3-3 (1Kanai F.

Thus, TAZ is negatively regulated by LATS kinases, core kinases of the tumor suppressor Hippo pathway. In human cancers, the dysregulation of the Hippo pathway and WWTR1 gene amplification lead to TAZ hyperactivation (5Piccolo S. Cordenonsi M. Dupont S.

TAZ activation induces epithelial–mesenchymal transition, enhances drug resistance, confers stemness to cancer cells, and is associated with poor prognosis in cancers. Hence, TAZ is regarded as a potential target for cancer therapy. We screened for TAZ inhibitors by means of a cell-based assay (7Nagashima S. Maruyama J. Kawano S. Iwasa H. Nakagawa K. Ishigami-Yuasa M. Kagechika H. Nishina H. Hata Y.

We expressed GFP-tagged TAZ (GFP-TAZ) in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells, in which the Hippo pathway is activated and inactivated depending on the cell density. In U2OS cells plated at low density, GFP-TAZ is accumulated in the nucleus. We applied 18,606 small chemical compounds to the cells and obtained as putative TAZ inhibitors compounds that shifted GFP-TAZ to the cytoplasm. We further selected compounds (IBS000540, IBS001594, IBS015181, and IBS015625) that significantly suppressed TAZ/TEAD-driven luciferase reporter activity in HEK293FT cells. IBS000540, IBS001594, and IBS015625 increased phosphorylated TAZ and decreased unphosphorylated TAZ. Hence, these three compounds inhibited TAZ in the phosphorylation-dependent manner through the canonical Hippo pathway. We previously reported these three compounds as TAZ inhibitors (7Nagashima S. Maruyama J. Kawano S. Iwasa H. Nakagawa K. Ishigami-Yuasa M. Kagechika H. Nishina H. Hata Y.

In contrast, IBS015181 did not increase the amount of phosphorylated TAZ. It implies that the effect of IBS015181 does not depend on the canonical Hippo pathway. In this article, we named IBS015181 (IUPAC name: 2,2-dichloro-N-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-phenylcyclopropane-1-carboxamide) as TAZ inhibitor 4 (TI-4) and characterized it. Chromosomal segregation 1 like (CSE1L) (also called cellular apoptosis susceptibility (CAS) and exportin-2; according to its official gene symbol (HGNC 2431; Entrez Gene 1434), we used CSE1L to describe both the protein (NP001307) and the gene in this article) was identified as the gene that rendered human breast cancer MCF-7 cells resistant to immunotoxins and turned out to be homologous to yeast CSE1 gene, which is involved in the regulation of chromatins (8Brinkmann U.

However, the mechanism underlying of the oncogenic action of CSE1L is not fully understood. We identified CSE1L as the target of TI-4. We revealed that CSE1L is involved in the regulation of the nuclear import of TAZ. Moreover, we demonstrated that CSE1L increases the nuclear TAZ and enhances malignancy in cancer cells. The structure of TI-4 is not related to those of the previously reported TAZ inhibitors, IBS00540, IBS001594, and IBS015625 (Fig. 1A) (7Nagashima S. Maruyama J. Kawano S. Iwasa H. Nakagawa K. Ishigami-Yuasa M. Kagechika H. Nishina H. Hata Y. Validation of chemical compound library screening for transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif inhibitors using GFP-fused transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif.Cancer Sci. 2016; 107: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). First, we confirmed the effect of TI-4 on the subcellular distribution of TAZ in U2OS cells expressing GFP-TAZ. TI-4 decreased the nuclear GFP-TAZ (Fig. 1B, an arrow). TI-4 also reduced endogenous TAZ in the nucleus in U2OS cells (Fig. 1C, an arrow). In the Phos-tag gel, TI-4 rather decreased the phosphorylated TAZ (Fig. 1D, arrows), which was detected with anti-phospho-TAZ (S89) antibody but did not increase the unphosphorylated TAZ (Fig. 1D, an arrowhead). We also applied TI-4 to the cells expressing GFP-TAZ S89A mutant (Fig. S1A). TI-4 shifted GFP-TAZ S89A to the cytoplasm, which further supports that the effect of TI-4 is independent of TAZ phosphorylation. In the previous study, we showed that TI-4 suppressed TAZ/TEAD-driven luciferase reporter activity in HEK293FT cells (7Nagashima S. Maruyama J. Kawano S. Iwasa H. Nakagawa K. Ishigami-Yuasa M. Kagechika H. Nishina H. Hata Y. Validation of chemical compound library screening for transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif inhibitors using GFP-fused transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif.Cancer Sci. 2016; 107: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In the reporter assay, we used the artificial reporter gene driven by eight repeats of the TEAD-responsive sequence. In this study, we examined the effect of TI-4 on endogenous TEAD target genes. quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that TI-4 suppressed the expression of CTGF and CYR61 in H1299 cells (Fig. 2A). As TAZ and TEAD play a role in the cancer development, we next examined the effect of TI-4 on cancer cells. We applied TI-4 to A549, H1299, and U87MG cells. We previously confirmed that WWTR1 silencing compromises the cell viability in these cancer cells (7Nagashima S. Maruyama J. Kawano S. Iwasa H. Nakagawa K. Ishigami-Yuasa M. Kagechika H. Nishina H. Hata Y. Validation of chemical compound library screening for transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif inhibitors using GFP-fused transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif.Cancer Sci. 2016; 107: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Therefore, if TI-4 is a TAZ inhibitor, it should suppress the viability of these cancer cells. Indeed, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays showed that TI-4 suppressed cell proliferation in these cells (Fig. 2B). TI-4 also blocked colony formation in the soft agar (Fig. 2C). These findings support that TI-4 inhibits TAZ/TEAD target genes and exhibits the anticancer effect. As TI-4 did not affect the phosphorylation state of TAZ but recruited TAZ into the cytoplasm, we speculated that TI-4 regulates TAZ through an unknown mechanism, which is distinct from the canonical Hippo pathway. With this in mind, we attempted to identify a target molecule of TI-4. We immobilized TI-4 onto Sepharose beads through a photoaffinity linker, charged the cell lysates of U87MG cells, and identified proteins that specifically bound to the beads (Fig. 3A). Although several protein bands were detected on control beads (Fig. 3A, Ctrl), the protein with approximately 97 kDa was detected only on TI-4-affinity beads (Fig. 3A, TI-4, an arrow). The protein was subjected to MS analysis and identified peptides derived from CSE1L (Fig. S2). Next, we applied TI-4 to U2OS-GFP-TAZ cells after CSE1L silencing and examined whether CSE1L is required for TI-4 to recruit TAZ into the cytoplasm. CSE1L silencing abolished the effect of TI-4 (Fig. 3B). In the immunofluorescence, TI-4 decreased GFP-TAZ in the nucleus (Fig. 3C, siCtrl, arrowheads). CSE1L silencing itself reduced the nuclear GFP-TAZ (Fig. 3C, siCSE1L #1, an arrowhead), and TI-4 did not show any additional effect. We also examined in H1299 cells whether CSE1L silencing blocked the effect of TI-4 on the expression of CTGF and CYR61. CSE1L silencing itself suppressed the expression of CTGF and CYR61 in HEK293FT cells (Fig. 3D, the first and third bars), while TI-4 did not decrease the expression of CTGF and CYR61 in the CSE1L-negative background (Fig. 3D, the third and fourth bars). Furthermore, CSE1L silencing suppressed the cell viability of H1299 cells in MTT assay (Fig. 3E), whereas TI-4 did not show any additional effect in the CSE1L-negative background (Fig. 3E, siCSE1L #1). These results support that TI-4 requires CSE1L to inhibit TAZ/TEAD target genes and to show anticancer effect. We next examined whether and how CSE1L affects the subcellular distribution of TAZ. CSE1L silencing reduced the nuclear GFP-TAZ in U2OS-GFP-TAZ cells and the endogenous nuclear TAZ in U2OS cells (Fig. 4, A and B, arrows). Conversely, CSE1L overexpression increased the nuclear TAZ (Fig. 4C, an arrow). CSE1L silencing did not increase unphosphorylated TAZ (Fig. 4D, an arrow). Furthermore, we knocked down CSE1L in U2OS cells expressing GFP-TAZ S89A (Fig. S1B). CSE1L silencing shifted TAZ S89A mutant to the cytoplasm. These findings support that the effect of CSE1L on the subcellular localization of TAZ does not depend on the phosphorylation state of TAZ. We next performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay. The nuclear GFP was photobleached in U2OS-GFP-TAZ cells. TI-4 delayed the recovery of the GFP signal in the nucleus (Fig. 5A, squares). Ivermectin, which was identified as the TAZ inhibitor in the drug screening and is thought to be an importin inhibitor, showed a similar effect (18Nishio M. Sugimachi K. Goto H. Wang J. Morikawa T. Miyachi Y. Takano Y. Hikasa H. Itoh T. Suzuki S.O. Kurihara H. Aishima S. Leask A. Sasaki T. Nakano T. et al.Dysregulated YAP1/TAZ and TGF-β signaling mediate hepatocarcinogenesis in Mob1a/1b-deficient mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: E71-E80Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A, triangles). As CSE1L silencing decreased nuclear GFP-TAZ, the basal intensity of the nuclear GFP signal before photobleaching was lower in CSE1L-depleted cells than in control cells. Even so, CSE1L silencing delayed the recovery (Fig. 5B). TI-4 did not show additional effect after CSE1L silencing (Fig. 5C). We investigated into the molecular mechanism, by which TI-4 delays the nuclear incorporation of TAZ. The alias of CSE1L is exportin-2. Importin α has a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-binding site, forms a complex with NLS-harboring proteins and importin β, and incorporates NLS-harboring proteins into the nucleus (19Oka M. Yoneda Y. Importin α: Functions as a nuclear transport factor and beyond.Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B Phys. Biol. Sci. 2018; 94: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, the complex is dissociated. Then CSE1L binds to the released importin α and exports it into the cytoplasm (11Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Export of importin alpha from the nucleus is mediated by a specific nuclear transport factor.Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 12Herold A.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, CSE1L contributes to the recycling of importin α. Recently, Kofler et al. (20Kofler M. Speight P. Little D. Di Ciano-Oliveira C. Szászi K. Kapus A. Mediated nuclear import and export of TAZ and the underlying molecular requirements.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have revealed that TAZ has a new class NLS motif in the C-terminal region and a nuclear efflux signal in the N-terminal region. We tested whether TAZ can interact with importin α. We coexpressed GFP-TAZ with various FLAG-tagged importin α proteins in HEK293FT cells and performed the coimmunoprecipitation experiment and detected the interaction between TAZ and importin α proteins (Fig. S4A). We also immunoprecipitated TAZ from HEK293FT cells and detected the interaction between endogenous TAZ and importin α5 (Fig. S4B) and focused on importin α5 in this study. First, we confirmed that CSE1L is involved in the export of importin α5 in U2OS cells. We knocked down CSE1L in U2OS cells expressing GFP-importin α5. CSE1L silencing increased nuclear GFP-importin α5 in immunofluorescence and the subcellular fractionation (Fig. S5, an arrow). We subsequently examined whether and how TI-4 affects the interaction between CSE1L and importin α5. The interaction between CSE1L and importin α5 was hardly detected at the basal state, but TI-4 made it detectable (Fig. 6A, an arrow). We next examined whether and how TI-4 influenced the subcellular localization of importin α5. Under the treatment of TI-4, the nuclear importin α5 was reduced (Fig. 6B). These findings suggest that importin α5 remains to bind to CSE1L and is not incorporated into the nucleus under the treatment with TI-4. CSE1L binds to the C-terminal region of importin α and interferes with the interaction between the NLS and armadillo repeats (12Herold A. Truant R. Wiegand H. Cullen B.R. Determination of the functional domain organization of the importin alpha nuclear import factor.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Hence, importin α does not bind to an NLS-harboring protein, until it is released from CSE1L. Considering the possibility that CSE1L competes with TAZ for the binding to importin α, we examined the effect of TI-4 on the interaction between TAZ and importin α5. TI-4 reduced the interaction between importin α5 and TAZ (Fig. 6C, an arrow). In contrast, CSE1L silencing remarkably augmented the interaction (Fig. 6D, an arrow). TI-4 did not inhibit the interaction between TAZ and importin α5 in the CSE1L-negative background (Fig. 6D, an arrowhead). These findings suggest that TI-4 blocks the dissociation of importin α5 from CSE1L in the cytoplasm and eventually inhibits the complex formation including importin α5 and TAZ. CSE1L is involved in the recycling of importin α (11Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Export of importin alpha from the nucleus is mediated by a specific nuclear transport factor.Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). CSE1L is required for the nuclear import of nuclear proteins including histone deacetylases (21Dong Q. Li X. Wang C.Z. Xu S. Yuan G. Shao W. Liu B. Zheng Y. Wang H. Lei X. Zhang Z. Zhu B. Roles of the CSE1L-mediated nuclear import pathway in epigenetic silencing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: E4013-E4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered that CSE1L may regulate the subcellular distribution of other nuclear proteins. CSE1L silencing decreased the nuclear endogenous YAP1 in U2OS cells (Fig. 4B). We used U2OS cells expressing GFP-YAP1 and conducted FRAP assay (Fig. S6A). In FRAP experiment, CSE1L silencing delayed the recovery of the nuclear GFP-YAP1. However, when we immunoblotted the samples of subcellular fractionation, CSE1L silencing did not affect the nuclear localization of endogenous β-catenin and FoxO3a (Fig. S6B). Thus, although the underlying mechanism is unknown, CSE1L is involved in the regulation of the limited population of nuclear proteins. In human cancers, CSE1L confers malignant properties to cancer cells and is regarded as a poor prognostic biomarker (22Jiang M.C. CAS (CSE1L) signaling pathway in tumor progression and its potential as a biomarker and target for targeted therapy.Tumour Biol. 2016; 37: 13077-13090Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We analyzed the public data of cancer patients with PrognoScan (http://gibk21.bse.kyutech.ac.jp/PrognoScan/index.html) (Fig. S7). Patients with high expression of CSE1L exhibited shorter survival in breast cancer (GSE4922, GSE11121), brain tumor (GSE4271), liposarcoma (GSE30929), lung cancer (GSE13213), and ovarian cancer (GSE9891). We raised a question whether and how TAZ contributes to CSE1L-mediated enhancement of malignancy. CSE1L promoted cell migration and invasiveness in A549 cells in transwell assays, whereas WWTR1 silencing attenuated the effect of CSE1L (Fig. 7A). Likewise, CSE1L promoted colony formation in the soft agar assay, but WWTR1 silencing blocked it (Fig. 7C). Conversely, we also observed that CSE1L silencing reduced TAZ-mediated malignant transformation in A549 cells (Fig. 7, B and D). We performed the same experiments using U87MG cells and obtained similar results (Fig. S8). Hence, it is reasoned that CSE1L increases TAZ in the nucleus and induces malignant transformation in cancer cells. On the other hand, it is likely that TAZ, even when expressed, fails to enhance malignancy in cancer cells lacking CSE1L. Finally, we wanted to know whether and how CSE1L expression correlates with TAZ expression in cancer patients. To this aim, we used human cancer microarray, evaluated CSE1L expression by using a semiquantitative scale of immunoreactive score and examined whether TAZ was detected in the nucleus in human cancers with high levels of CSE1L (Fig. S9). Of 45 lung adenocarcinoma and 16 lung squamous cell carcinoma cases, 33 and 12 cases were classified as CSE1L-high cases, respectively. All CSE1L-high cases express high levels of nuclear TAZ (Table 1). In contrast, nuclear TAZ expression was high in none of CSE1L-low adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma cases. In gastric and esophageal cancers, most cases did not express high levels of CSE1L (18% for gastric cancers and 15% for esophageal cancers). Nevertheless, CSE1L-high cancers tended to express TAZ at the high level in these cancers. Thus, high expression of CSE1L correlates with high expression of nuclear TAZ.Table 1Expression of CSE1L and nuclear TAZ in human cancersNuclear TAZ expressionHighLowSum(A) Lung cancer (ⅰ)AdenocarcinomaCSE1L expressionHigh33437Low088Sum331245 (ⅱ) Squamous cell carcinomaCSE1L expressionHigh12113Low033Sum12416(B) Gastric cancer CSE1L expressionHigh909Low202141 Sum294150(C) Esophageal cancer CSE1L expressionHigh437Low13940 Sum54247(A) (i) Chi square, 26.757, p = 0.0000002; (ii) chi square, 11.077, p = 0.0008741.(B) Chi square, 7.95, p = 0.005; (C) chi-square, 18.71, p = 0.00002.

In this article, we reported the novel TAZ inhibitor, TI-4. TI-4 shifts TAZ to the cytoplasm from the nucleus independent of TAZ phosphorylation, which suggests that the target of TI-4 is not a component of the canonical Hippo pathway. We identified CSE1L as its target. CSE1L is a mammalian homologue of yeast Cse1, which associates with chromatin, and was identified as the gene that made MCF-7 cells resistant to immunotoxin (8Brinkmann U. Brinkmann E. Gallo M. Pastan I. Cloning and characterization of a cellular apoptosis susceptibility gene, the human homologue to the yeast chromosome segregation gene CSE1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10427-10431Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). CSE1L was also identified as an importin α−binding protein (11Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Export of importin alpha from the nucleus is mediated by a specific nuclear transport factor.Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 12Herold A. Truant R. Wiegand H. Cullen B.R. Determination of the functional domain organization of the importin alpha nuclear import factor.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To maintain the nuclear transport, importin α must return from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. CSE1L is involved in the nuclear export of importin α. A previous study revealed that the nuclear import of histone deacetylases is suppressed by CSE1L depletion (21Dong Q. Li X. Wang C.Z. Xu S. Yuan G. Shao W. Liu B. Zheng Y. Wang H. Lei X. Zhang Z. Zhu B. Roles of the CSE1L-mediated nuclear import pathway in epigenetic silencing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: E4013-E4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suspected that CSE1L is also required for the nuclear import of TAZ. CSE1L silencing indeed decreased the nuclear TAZ, whereas CSE1L increased it. Despite the importance of the subcellular localization in the regulation of YAP1 and TAZ, our knowledge regarding the nuclear cytoplasmic transport of these proteins is yet limited. In Drosophila melanogaster, importin α1 binds to the N-terminal 55 amino acids of Yorkie, a homologue of YAP1/TAZ, and drives it into the nucleus (23Wang S. Lu Y. Yin M.X. Wang C. Wu W. Li J. Wu W. Ge L. Hu L. Zhao Y. Zhang L. Importin α1 mediates Yorkie nuclear import via an N-terminal non-canonical nuclear localization signal.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 7926-7937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the N-terminal sequence of TAZ is different from that of Yorkie and TAZ has the NLS not in the N-terminal region but in the C-terminal region (20Kofler M. Speight P. Little D. Di Ciano-Oliveira C. Szászi K. Kapus A. Mediated nuclear import and export of TAZ and the underlying molecular requirements.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we detected the coimmunoprecipitation of TAZ and importin α5. As CSE1L interferes with the binding of NLS to importin α, CSE1L is supposed to block the interaction between TAZ and importin α. Consistently, CSE1L silencing enhanced the interaction between TAZ and importin α5. TI-4 strengthened the interaction between CSE1L and importin α and weakened the interaction between TAZ and importin α depending on CSE1L. All these findings support the model that CSE1L facilitates TAZ nuclear incorporation through recycling importin α and that TI-4 prevents the formation of the complex including TAZ and importin α to block the nuclear entry of TAZ (Fig. 8). In human cancers, high expression of CSE1L is associated with a poor prognosis. CSE1L enhances drug resistance, invasion, and metastasis (13Wellmann A. Flemming P. Behrens P. Wuppermann K. Lang H.

In recent work, Rottenaicher et al. analyze five mutations found in the VL of a patient with cardiac AL.

HIV-1 subtype C is responsible for majority of global HIV-1 infections. In the present study, we examined the diversity in genetic signatures and attributes that differentiate region-specific HIV-1 subtype C gp120 sequences associated with virus neutralization outcomes to key bnAbs having distinct epitope specificities. A total of 1814 full length HIV-1 subtype C gp120 sequence from 37 countries were retrieved from Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV database (www.hiv.lanl.gov). The amino acid sequences were assessed for their phylogenetic association, variable loop lengths and prevalence of potential N-linked glycosylation sites (pNLGS). Responses of these sequences to bnAbs were predicted with a machine learning algorithm 'bNAb-ReP' and compared with those reported in the CATNAP database. Subtype C sequences from Asian countries including India differed phylogenetically when compared with that from African countries. Variable loop lengths and charges within Indian and African clusters were also found to be distinct from each other, specifically for V1, V2 and V4 loops. Pairwise analyses at each of the 25 pNLG sites indicated distinct country specific profiles. Highly significant differences (p<0.001***) were observed in prevalence of four pNLGS (N130, N295, N392 and N448) between South Africa and India, having most disease burden associated with subtype C. Our findings highlight that distinctly evolving clusters within global intra-subtype C gp120 sequences are likely to influence the disparate region-specific sensitivity of circulating HIV-1 subtype C to bnAbs."

Nevertheless, owing to the heterozygosity of the E. urophylla × E. grandis genetic background, germplasm improvement by crossbreeding tends to be inefficient. As an alternative approach, genetic engineering of Eucalyptus can be used to effectively improve germplasm resources. From a strategic standpoint, increasing the plantation productivity and wood quality by transgenic technology has become increasingly important for forest industry. In this study, we established a fluorescence labelling method using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to obtain positive transformed progenies. The positive transformed progenies were easily obtained from the genetically modified population via fluorescence screening. This system can be used as a plant genome site-specific editing tool and may be useful for improving Eucalyptus genetic resources."
https://openalex.org/W3160327948,"Thousands of proteins have been found to be modified by O-GlcNAc, a common glycosylation modification of serine and threonine residues throughout the cytosol and nucleus. O-GlcNAc is enzymatically added and removed from proteins, making it a potential dynamic regulator of cell signaling. However, compared with other posttranslational modifications like phosphorylation, relatively few O-GlcNAc-regulated pathways have been discovered and biochemically characterized. We previously discovered one such pathway, where O-GlcNAc controls the contraction of fibroblasts initiated by the signaling lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate. Specifically, we found that O-GlcNAc modification of the phosphatase MYPT1 maintains its activity, resulting in dephosphorylation and deactivation of the myosin light chain of the actinomyosin complex. Another signaling lipid that leads to contraction of fibroblasts is lysophosphatidic acid, and this signaling pathway also converges on MYPT1 and actinomyosin. We therefore rationalized that O-GlcNAc would also control this pathway. Here, we used a combination of small molecule inhibitors, 2D and 3D cell cultures, and biochemistry to confirm our hypothesis. Specifically, we found that O-GlcNAc levels control the sensitivity of mouse and primary human dermal fibroblasts to lysophosphatidic acid–induced contraction in culture and the phosphorylation of MLC and that MYPT1 O-GlcNAc modification is responsible. These findings further solidify the importance of O-GlcNAc in regulating the biology of fibroblasts in response to procontractile stimuli."

The ECD consists of a short three-stranded antiparallel beta sheet and short helices and is stabilized by two disulfide bonds (35Zhang S. Zhou J. Zhang Y. Liu T. Friedel P. Zhuo W. Somasekharan S.

Point mutations of highly conserved cysteines in the ECD or ECD chimeras of KCC2 and KCC4 resulted in transport-inactive variants (50Hartmann A.-M. Wenz M. Mercado A. Störger C. Mount D.B. Friauf E. Nothwang H.G. Differences in the large extracellular loop between the K+-Cl- cotransporters KCC2 and KCC4.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23994-24002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggesting that conformational changes in the ECD impact ion coordination indirectly. Here, we made use of a KCC2 variant with an 3xHA tag in the extracellular loop 2 (EL2) connecting TM3 and TM4 (KCC2HA). EL2 is located close to the ECD and we hypothesized that structural modification of this loop will affect folding of the ECD. While KCC2WT and KCC2HA showed same functionality, we observed striking differences when residues coordinating the K+ binding site were mutated. The structural modification of EL2 in KCC2HA yielded a variant which despite mutation of conserved sites could still transport K+. Homology modeling suggested that insertion of the HA tag is indeed inducing conformational changes in the ECD because of a modified EL2 interaction. These changes most likely are transduced via the extracellular interaction network (46Liu S. Chang S. Han B. Xu L. Zhang M. Zhao C. Yang W. Wang F. Li J. Delpire E.J.S. Cryo-EM structures of the human cation-chloride cotransporter KCC1.Science. 2019; 366: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) of the ECD to TM1 and TM6 and seem to alter to the K+–binding sites in KCC2HA. KCC2 is present in the two splice variants KCC2a and KCC2b that differ in the first exon coding the distal part of the N terminus. To analyses whether these two splice variants differ in their transport activity, we performed Tl+-based flux measurements with both of them (KCC2aWT and KCC2bWT). To investigate the impact of the ECD on KCC2-mediated transport, we used KCC2b with a 3xHA tag (IFYPYDVPDYAGYPYDVPDYAG-SYPYDVPDYAAHAAA) in EL2 of the KCC2b clone (KCC2bHA). The tag with a length of 37 amino acid residues is inserted at the end of EL2 reaching into TM4 (31Zhao B. Wong A.Y.C. Murshid A. Bowie D. Presley J.F. Bedford F.K.

In parallel, we monitored their transfection rates to provide similar transfection rates for every construct used in our flux measurements. Tl+ flux measurements demonstrated that KCC2aWT (100% ± 9%), KCC2bWT (90% ± 17%, p = 0.25), and KCC2bHA (87% ± 17%, p = 0.1) possess similar transport activities (Fig. 2A, Table 1).

However, the mechanism of how this channel is activated by heat remains elusive. Here we found that a series of polyols including sucrose, sorbitol, and hyaluronan significantly elevate the heat activation threshold temperature of TRPV1. The modulatory effects of these polyols were only observed when they were perfused extracellularly. Interestingly, mutation of residues E601 and E649 in the outer pore region of TRPV1 largely abolished the effects of these polyols. We further observed that intraplantar injection of polyols into the hind paws of rats reduced their heat-induced pain response. Our observations not only suggest that the extracellular regions of TRPV1 are critical for the modulation of heat activation by polyols, but also indicate a potential role of polyols in reducing heat-induced pain sensation.

TRP channels and pain.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2013; 29: 355-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Among these TRP channels, TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1) is a prototypical molecular sensor for detecting noxious heat (10Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. The capsaicin receptor: A heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway.Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6636) Google Scholar). TRPV1 is activated by temperature above 40 °C with a high temperature sensitivity in channel open probability (Q10 being 20~30) (12Vyklický L. Vlachová V. Vitásková Z. Dittert I. Kabát M. Orkand R.K.

A. 2000; 97: 13889-13894Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). At present, although the high-resolution three-dimensional structures of TRPV1 have been determined by cryo-EM (14Cao E. Liao M. Cheng Y. Julius D. TRPV1 structures in distinct conformations reveal activation mechanisms.Nature. 2013; 504: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 15Liao M. Cao E. Julius D. Cheng Y. Structure of the TRPV1 ion channel determined by electron cryo-microscopy.Nature. 2013; 504: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar), how TRPV1 obtains the high temperature sensitivity is still unclear. Structurally, like all TRP channels, TRPV1 is a tetramer and each subunit contains six transmembrane domains (S1–S6), a hydrophobic pore loop linking transmembrane S5 and S6, and large cytoplasmic N and C terminals (15Liao M. Cao E. Julius D. Cheng Y. Structure of the TRPV1 ion channel determined by electron cryo-microscopy.Nature. 2013; 504: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). At the protein level, different regions of the N-terminal domain as well as the C-terminal domain, the pore turret, and the pore/extracellular loop following the pore have all been suggested to be critical for heat activation (16Brauchi S.

To reconcile and understand these experimental observations regarding heat activation of TRPV1, a previous study proposed a theoretical framework for temperature activation of TRP channels: changes in heat capacity of TRP channel proteins caused by buried/exposure of specific residues mediates temperature activation, where how water molecules interact with protein residues is crucial (23Clapham D.E. Miller C. A thermodynamic framework for understanding temperature sensing by transient receptor potential (TRP) channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2011; 108: 19492-19497Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Initial experimental evidence for such a hypothesis was found in voltage-gated potassium channels (24Chowdhury S. Jarecki B.W. Chanda B. A molecular framework for temperature-dependent gating of ion channels.Cell. 2014; 158: 1148-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our previous study on cold activation of TRPM8 channel also confirmed the validity of this hypothesis, where we found that tuning the hydrophobicity of residues undergoing buried/exposure conformational changes during cold activation can specifically alter the cold sensitivity of TRPM8 channel (25Xu L. Han Y. Chen X. Aierken A. Wen H. Zheng W. Wang H. Lu X. Zhao Z. Ma C. Liang P. Yang W. Yang S. Yang F. Molecular mechanisms underlying menthol binding and activation of TRPM8 ion channel.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 3790Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, whether such a theoretical framework of temperature activation is applicable to heat activation of TRPV1 remains untested. Polyols are compounds with different numbers of hydroxyl groups, such as D-sorbitol, sucrose, and sodium hyaluronate (HA) (Fig. 1A). Owing to the ability to stabilize proteins as osmolytes, polyols have a crucial role in protecting organisms against ambient stress such as temperature, where the multiple hydroxyl groups in a polyol molecule may compete with water molecules with the protein residues. Disruption of water–protein interactions by polyols further leads to changes in protein stability (26Davis-Searles P.R. Saunders A.J. Erie D.A. Winzor D.J. Pielak G.J. Interpreting the effects of small uncharged solutes on protein-folding equilibria.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 271-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). High concentrations of polyols impact protein stability in vitro. For example, glycerin and sucrose increase protein stability (26Davis-Searles P.R. Saunders A.J. Erie D.A. Winzor D.J. Pielak G.J. Interpreting the effects of small uncharged solutes on protein-folding equilibria.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 271-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 27Liao Y.H.

Res. 2002; 19: 1847-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that the stability increases with increasing the molecular volume and concentration of the polyols, and stability is a linear function of osmotic concentration (28Back J.F.

Soc. 2004; 126: 11794-11795Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The effect of polyols on proteins may be explained by indirect interaction, where the preferential exclusion mechanism leads to indirect interactions by which polyol molecules are expelled from the protein surface, thereby forming a thin hydration shell around the surface of the protein and ultimately altering the ordering of water in polyol solution. The ordering extent of water increases with enhancement of polyols molecular volume (30Liu F.F. Ji L. Zhang L. Dong X.Y. Sun Y. Molecular basis for polyol-induced protein stability revealed by molecular dynamics simulations.J. Chem. Phys. 2010; 132: 225103Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reason that, for the TRPV1 channel, adding polyols in solution may also alter its water–protein interactions so that the heat activation is modulated accordingly. In this study, we investigated how three typical polyols and ethanol modulate TRPV1 heat activation. We first conducted patch clamp recordings with HEK293 cells expressing the wildtype or mutant TRPV1 channel while applying polyols extracellularly or intracellularly. We found that extracellular polyols increase the TRPV1 heat activation threshold temperature, and residues in the outer pore region critical for proton activation are also essential for polyol modulation of TRPV1 heat activation. Based on our in vitro findings, we further carried out behavioral tests with rats and observed that polyols protect rats against noxious heat as polyols can reduce rat’s heat sensitivity monitored by increasing thermal paw withdrawal latency. This work tried to elucidate the molecular mechanism of structural stability of the TRPV1 in polyol solutions, providing a new idea for the development of novel TRPV1 antagonists from the perspective of biophysics. Since the temperature sensitivity of TRPV1 is modulated by the transmembrane voltage (32Yang F. Xu L. Lee B.H. Xiao X. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Zheng J. An unorthodox mechanism underlying voltage sensitivity of TRPV1 ion channel.Adv. Sci. 2020; 7: 2000575Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the biphasic pulses (−80 and +80 mV) were used when recording the thermal activation current. We first conducted inside-out recording while raising the temperature of the recording chamber and found that the thermal activation threshold of wildtype human TRPV1 was 38.6 ± 1.3 °C (n = 10, Fig. 1, B–D). Then, we applied various concentrations of different polyols from the extracellular side (polyols in the pipette solution) and observed the significantly delayed steep increase of current amplitude in response to temperature jumps compared with the control group (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we analyzed these data and found that three polyols significantly raised the threshold temperature of TRPV1 as well as ΔT (shift in threshold temperature compared with control) in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). On the contrary, ethanol containing only one hydroxyl group in its chemical structure is known to activate the TRPV1 channel (33Trevisani M. Smart D. Gunthorpe M.J. Tognetto M. Barbieri M. Campi B. Amadesi S. Gray J. Jerman J.C. Brough S.J. Owen D. Smith G.D. Randall A.D. Harrison S. Bianchi A. et al.Ethanol elicits and potentiates nociceptor responses via the vanilloid receptor-1.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In either inside-out or outside-out recordings where ethanol was perfused to the extracellular or intracellular side of the TRPV1 channel, it left-shifted the thermal activation threshold compared with the control group likely due to its high membrane permeability (last panels of Fig. 1, B–D, and Fig. S1, A and B). When the two key residues for proton activation of the TRPV1 channel were mutated (E601Q-E649Q) (34Jordt S.E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Acid potentiation of the capsaicin receptor determined by a key extracellular site.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8134-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), ethanol no longer decreased the heat activation threshold (Fig. S1, C and D). It is well known that adding polyols increases the osmolarity of the solution (Fig. S2A). To test whether the increase in heat activation threshold of TRPV1 by polyol was caused by changes in osmolarity, we performed the control experiments. We observed that, although 500 mM sorbitol increased the osmolarity of bath solution to 784 mOsm/kg and elevated the heat activation threshold of TRPV1, adding urea to bath solution to the same 784 mOsm/kg did not elevate the heat activation threshold (Fig. S2, B–D). Therefore, we believe that it was not the increase in osmolarity that caused changes in heat activation of TRPV1. To examine whether polyols applied to the intracellular side alter TRPV1 heat activation as when they were applied extracellularly, we also carried out inside-out patch recording with various concentrations of polyols in the bath. Interestingly, unlike extracellular polyols, intracellular polyols did not affect the TRPV1 heat activation (Fig. 2, A and B). Therefore, these findings indicate that polyols are likely to interact with the extracellular region of TRPV1 to stabilize this membrane-embedded channel protein. To quantify for protein-stabilizing effects of polyols, we plotted the thermal activation threshold of TRPV1 against various concentrations of different polyols as well as ethanol and conducted regression analysis. The linear regression line has a positive slope with correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.94 for sorbitol and 0.96 for sucrose, respectively (Fig. 2C, dashed lines in cyan and red, respectively). Different from polyols, ethanol exhibits a negative slope with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 (Fig. 2C, dashed line in purple). These results indicate that a polyol of larger concentration has a stronger protein-stabilizing effect. It is noteworthy that sorbitol has two fewer hydroxyl groups than sucrose. In order to investigate how the numbers of hydroxyl groups of a polyol affects the TRPV1 heat activation, we plotted ΔT against concentration of hydroxyl groups and carried out regression analysis. The linear regression line has a positive slope of 1.25 ± 0.09 °C/mol with a good correlation coefficient of 0.98 (Fig. 2D). More importantly, both sorbitol and sucrose exhibited the same hydroxyl group concentration dependence of ΔT, indicating that there is a common physical basis underlying the modulatory effects of polyols (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the numbers of hydroxyl groups of a polyol play a pivotal role in protecting TRPV1 protein against thermal stimulus. The discernable increase in the threshold temperature of polyols prompted us to explore the structural basis for this change. Because we have observed that polyols delay TRPV1 heat activation only from the extracellular side but not intracellular side, we reasoned that the channel structure(s) mediating the effect of reducing heat sensitivity should be exposed to the extracellular aqueous environment. Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated that the outer pore region is essential for TRPV1 heat activation (21Yang F. Cui Y. Wang K. Zheng J. Thermosensitive TRP channel pore turret is part of the temperature activation pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 7083-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 35Yang S. Yang F. Wei N. Hong J. Li B. Luo L. Rong M. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Zheng J. Wang K. Lai R. A pain-inducing centipede toxin targets the heat activation machinery of nociceptor TRPV1.Nat.

Divalent cations activate TRPV1 through promoting conformational change of the extracellular region.J. Gen. Physiol. 2014; 143: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, our research for sites related to heat-evoked TRPV1 activation focused on the pore turret region. To test our hypothesis, we first generated two different turret replacement mutants, namely, R2 and R4, based on our previous study (Fig. 3F) (17Cui Y. Yang F. Cao X. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Wang K. Zheng J. Selective disruption of high sensitivity heat activation but not capsaicin activation of TRPV1 channels by pore turret mutations.J. Gen. Physiol. 2012; 139: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and observed that they have similar responsiveness to capsaicin compared with wildtype (Fig. S3). Then, we recorded the thermal threshold activation of two mutants in bath solution and found that their values are in line with our previous observations, showing lower threshold temperature than wildtype with 33.3 ± 1.9 °C (n = 9, p < 0.001) for R2 and 27.1 ± 1.8 °C for R4 (n = 11, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3, A–C). After applying sorbitol to these two mutants from the extracellular side, we found that sorbitol still could significantly increase the thermal threshold activations of two mutants compared with their control groups at both concentrations (Fig. 3, A–D). In contrast, intracellular polyol still had little effect on the thermal threshold of activation of two mutants, resembling the response of wildtype TRPV1 to polyols with the same conditions (Fig. 3E). However, when we plotted thermal activation thresholds of the wildtype and two mutant TRPV1 channels against two concentrations of sorbitol and conducted regression analysis, we found that the sorbitol concentration dependence of shifts in heat activation threshold of two mutants exhibits larger slopes (14.40 ± 2.33 °C/mol for R2 and 21.66 ± 8.03 °C/mol for R4) than wildtype TRPV1 (5.80 ± 1.03 °C/mol) (Fig. 3D and Table 1). These observations show that the magnitude of polyol’s effects on TRPV1 heat activation is modulated by the turret of TRPV1.Table 1The intercepts (a) and slopes (b and c, b for ethanol and polyols original concentration; c for those of hydroxyl group concentration) from ethanol/polyols concentration-thermal activation threshold curves in wildtype and mutant TRPV1 channelsThreshold temperature for heat activationa (°C)b (°C/mol) Polyolc (°C/mol) -OHWT-ETOH36.22 ± 0.91−6.49 ± 0.95−6.49 ± 0.95WT-SUC37.05 ± 0.516.57 ± 0.900.82 ± 0.11WT-SOR38.46 ± 0.595.80 ± 1.030.98 ± 0.17R2-SOR33.24 ± 0.7514.40 ± 2.33∗∗2.40 ± 0.39∗∗R4-SOR28.23 ± 2.6021.66 ± 8.03∗∗∗3.61 ± 1.34∗∗∗E601Q-E649Q double mutant-SOR45.23 ± 0.70−1.31 ± 1.22∗∗∗−0.22 ± 0.20∗∗WT-pH6.0-SOR34.39 ± 0.8720.34 ± 2.69∗∗∗3.39 ± 0.45∗∗∗ETOH, ethanol; SOR, D-sorbitol; SUC, sucrose.The data are represented as the mean ± SD, ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001, versus the corresponding control group.

Extracellular protons potentiate heat sensitivity of TRPV1. E601 and E649 (amino acid numbers are for mouse TRPV1) within the pore region are two crucial pH sensors for acidification of extracellular environment (34Jordt S.E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Acid potentiation of the capsaicin receptor determined by a key extracellular site.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8134-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that these two sites may also be critical for the effects of polyols on heat activation. We first conducted patch clamping with extracellular acidic solution (pH 6.0) while raising the temperature of the recording chamber. As expected, extracellular proton lowered the heat activation threshold as compared with the neutral pH (Fig. 4C). We further observed that, when sorbitol was perfused with acidic solution, it can still reverse the synergistic effect of protons on wildtype TRPV1 heat activation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A–C, left panels; Fig. 4D). The E601Q-E649Q double mutant virtually eliminates proton potentiation of the TRPV1 channel (34Jordt S.E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Acid potentiation of the capsaicin receptor determined by a key extracellular site.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8134-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), so we then repeated the above-mentioned experiment with this mutant and found that sorbitol can no longer elevate the heat activation threshold even at a high concentration of 1000 mM (Fig. 4, A–C, right panels; Fig. 4D). Taken together, our observations suggest that E601 and E649 in the outer pore region of TRPV1 are important for modulation of heat activation threshold by polyols. Besides being activated by noxious heat, the TRPV1 channel is also activated by capsaicin and extracellular protons (10Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. The capsaicin receptor: A heat-activated ion channel in the pain pathway.Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6636) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that the pungency of oral capsaicin was reduced by polyol-containing solutions (37Nolden A.A. Lenart G. Hayes J.E. Putting out the fire - efficacy of common beverages in reducing oral burn from capsaicin.Physiol. Behav. 2019; 208: 112557Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, we observed that, when the TRPV1 channel was activated by capsaicin (3 μM), adding sorbitol (500 mM) did not reduce channel activation (Fig. 4, E and G). In contrast, we found that polyols could significantly inhibit the TRPV1 activation by extracellular protons (Fig. 4, F and G). These observations are not surprising, because capsaicin binds to the transmembrane domains of TRPV1 (14Cao E. Liao M. Cheng Y. Julius D. TRPV1 structures in distinct conformations reveal activation mechanisms.Nature. 2013; 504: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 38Yang F. Xiao X. Lee B.H. Vu S. Yang W.

Biol. 2015; 11: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), whereas the residues critical for proton activation locate in the outer pore domain (34Jordt S.E. Tominaga M. Julius D.

How were the modulatory effects of polyols on the heat activation of the TRPV1 channel that we have observed in cellular electrophysiology experiments manifested at the animal behavioral level? As the heat activation threshold of TRPV1 was increased by polyols, we hypothesized that polyols would decrease TRPV1 activation by noxious heat to relieve pain. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we conducted hot plate test under a constantly high temperature after bilateral intraplantar pretreatment with sorbitol, HA, and ethanol to each group of rats. We set the temperature of the hot plate to be 50 °C so that it readily activates the TRPV1 channel but not the other noxious heat sensor TRPV2 channel with an activation threshold higher than 52 °C (9Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. A capsaicin-receptor homologue with a high threshold for noxious heat.Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). In rats pretreated with sorbitol, thermal paw withdrawal latency was significantly higher than in rats receiving saline (saline: 10.9 ± 2.3 s, n = 8; sorbitol: 18.1 ± 5.9 s, n = 8; p < 0.01; Fig. 5A). Similar results were also obtained from HA pretreatment group, as HA has been reported to reduce pain in mice (41Caires R. Luis E. Taberner F.J. Fernandez-Ballester G. Ferrer-Montiel A. Balazs E.A. Gomis A. Belmonte C. de la Pena E. Hyaluronan modulates TRPV1 channel opening, reducing peripheral nociceptor activity and pain.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8095Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (saline: 13.6 ± 3.2 s, n = 15; HA: 19.2 ± 6.8 s, n = 19; p < 0.01; Fig. 5B). In contrast, each dose group of TRPV1-activating ethanol exhibits significantly shorter thermal paw withdrawal latency than the saline group (saline: 11.2 ± 4.1 s, n = 11; low dose: 8.0 ± 2.5 s, n = 11, p < 0.05; high dose: 4.9 ± 1.6 s, n = 8, p < 0.001; Fig. 5C). In addition, we chose two positive control drugs (AMG9810, which is a competitive TRPV1 antagonist (42Gavva N.R. Bannon A.W. Surapaneni S. Hovland Jr., D.N. Lehto S.G. Gore A. Juan T. Deng H. Han B.

After a pilot study (N = 10), which indicated feasible and deliverable study procedures and interventions, we launched an RCT with a target sample size of 352 participants randomised to either three sessions of PE or non-directive support. Due to an unforeseen major reorganisation at the hospital, the RCT was discontinued after 32 included participants. In this paper, we highlight obstacles and lessons learned from our feasibility work that are relevant for preventive psychological interventions for PTSD in emergency settings. One important finding was the high degree of attrition, and only 75% and 34%, respectively, came back for the 2-month and 6-month assessments. There were also difficulties in reaching eligible patients immediately after the event. Based on our experiences, we envisage that alternative models of implementation might overcome these obstacles, for example, with remote delivery of both assessments and interventions via the internet or smartphones combined with multiple recruitment procedures. Lessons learned from this terminated RCT are discussed in depth."

For example, inhibition of antibody-mediated phagocytosis leads to a compensatory upregulation of CR3-mediated sinking phagocytosis. These findings animate, in vivid colors, processes previously only captured as stills, exposing interactions between different phagocytic mechanisms and altering our basic understanding of this important process."

The Drosophila master sex-switch protein Sex-lethal (SXL) is an RNA-binding protein that controls splicing, polyadenylation, or translation of certain mRNAs to mediate female-specific sexual differentiation. Whereas some targets of SXL are known, previous studies indicate that additional targets of SXL have escaped genetic screens.Here, we have used an alternative molecular approach of GEnomic Selective Enrichment of Ligands by Exponential enrichment (GESELEX) using both the genomic DNA and cDNA pools from several Drosophila developmental stages to identify new potential targets of SXL. Our systematic analysis provides a comprehensive view of the Drosophila transcriptome for potential SXL-binding sites.We have successfully identified new SXL-binding sites in the Drosophila transcriptome. We discuss the significance of our analysis and that the newly identified binding sites and sequences could serve as a useful resource for the research community. This approach should also be applicable to other RNA-binding proteins for which downstream targets are unknown."

IL-37 is a cytokine with anti-inflammatory characteristics that has been demonstrated to induce tolerogenic properties in DC. In this study we aimed to evaluate the influence of IL-37 on DC–T cell interaction, with a special focus on the role of the chemokine CXCL1. DC were cultured from bone marrow of human IL-37 transgenic (hIL-37Tg) or WT mice. The phenotype of unstimulated and LPS-stimulated DC was analyzed (co-stimulatory molecules and MHCII by flow cytometry, cytokine profile by RT-PCR and ELISA), and T cell stimulatory capacity was assessed in mixed lymphocyte reaction. The role of CXCL1 in T cell activation was analyzed in T cell stimulation assays with anti-CD3 or allogeneic DC. The expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86, and of MHCII in LPS-stimulated DC was not affected by endogenous expression of IL-37, whereas LPS-stimulated hIL-37Tg DC produced less CXCL1 compared to LPS-stimulated WT DC. T cell stimulatory capacity of LPS-matured hIL-37Tg DC was comparable to that of WT DC. Recombinant mouse CXCL1 did not increase T cell proliferation either alone or in combination with anti-CD3 or allogeneic DC, nor did CXCL1 affect the T cell production of interferon-γ and IL-17. Endogenous IL-37 expression does not affect mouse DC phenotype or subsequent T cell stimulatory capacity, despite a reduced CXCL1 production. In addition, we did not observe an effect of CXCL1 in T cell proliferation or differentiation."
