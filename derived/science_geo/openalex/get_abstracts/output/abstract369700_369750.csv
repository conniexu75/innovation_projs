To investigate the opioidergic mechanisms that underlie placebo analgesia, we combined naloxone administration with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Naloxone reduced both behavioral and neural placebo effects as well as placebo-induced responses in pain-modulatory cortical structures, such as the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). In a brainstem-specific analysis, we observed a similar naloxone modulation of placebo-induced responses in key structures of the descending pain control system, including the hypothalamus, the periaqueductal gray (PAG), and the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). Most importantly, naloxone abolished placebo-induced coupling between rACC and PAG, which predicted both neural and behavioral placebo effects as well as activation of the RVM. These findings show that opioidergic signaling in pain-modulating areas and the projections to downstream effectors of the descending pain control system are crucially important for placebo analgesia.

Placebo effects are ubiquitous in modern medicine, not only as a control in randomized controlled trials but also as a subject of intense study in diverse clinical fields, such as Parkinson's disease, depression, immune function, and pain (Benedetti et al., 2005Benedetti F.

One of the best-studied placebo effects is placebo analgesia, where the administration of a pharmacologically inert substance has a pain-relieving effect, presumably due to the subject's expectation that a potent analgesic substance is being administered (Montgomery and Kirsch, 1997Montgomery G.H.

Importantly, several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies and one PET study have also demonstrated placebo-induced signal decreases in pain-sensitive brain regions, such as thalamus, insula, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (Bingel et al., 2006Bingel U.

Placebo-induced changes in FMRI in the anticipation and experience of pain.Science. 2004; 303: 1162-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), most likely related to the pain reduction experienced under placebo. With regard to an underlying mechanism that can explain these observations, it has been hypothesized that placebo analgesia recruits the opioidergic descending pain control system (Basbaum and Fields, 1984Basbaum A.I. Fields H.L. Endogenous pain control systems: brainstem spinal pathways and endorphin circuitry.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1984; 7: 309-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar, Fields et al., 2006Fields H.L. Basbaum A.I. Heinricher M.M.

Descending control of pain.Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 355-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar), the activation of which leads to inhibition of nociceptive processing at the level of the spinal cord and thus to reduced neural responses in pain-responsive brain regions and a concurrently reduced pain experience. This pain control network presumably includes cortical structures, such as the DLPFC and rACC, but also includes the amygdala, hypothalamus, PAG, and rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). The above-mentioned fMRI and tracer PET studies have provided evidence for DLPFC, rACC, and, in some cases, PAG involvement in placebo analgesia, and behavioral findings suggest a spinal component (Matre et al., 2006Matre D. Casey K.L. Knardahl S. Placebo-induced changes in spinal cord pain processing.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, conclusive evidence for the involvement of the lower opioid system (amygdala, hypothalamus, PAG, and RVM) and especially its functional relevance (i.e., relation to pain experience and neural responses in pain-sensitive areas) is scarce, also because the spatial resolution of previous studies was less sensitive for the analysis of these small structures. Testing the hypothesized mechanism of descending pain control during placebo analgesia requires an experimental approach that is sensitive to neural responses in pain-encoding and pain-modulating areas and to their dependence on endogenous opioid neurotransmission. Neither tracer PET nor fMRI alone can satisfy these two conditions, as tracer PET is not sensitive to increases or decreases in neural responses (or an equivalent thereof) and standard fMRI cannot make inferences about neurochemical events. We therefore employed pharmacological fMRI (Honey and Bullmore, 2004Honey G. Bullmore E. Human pharmacological MRI.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 366-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, Leslie and James, 2000Leslie R.A. James M.F. Pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging: a new application for functional MRI.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 314-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) in two groups of subjects (n = 48): one receiving the opioid antagonist naloxone and one receiving saline. This allowed us to compare both behavioral and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses under a “natural opioid state” and a “blocked opioid state.” To also allow investigation of BOLD responses in lower brainstem areas, we made use of higher spatial resolution in comparison to previous imaging studies on placebo-analgesia and employed a brainstem-dedicated image preprocessing strategy. We used an established placebo analgesia paradigm that included an initial expectation manipulation phase and a later test phase (Price et al., 1999Price D.D. Milling L.S. Kirsch I. Duff A. Montgomery G.H. Nicholls S.S. An analysis of factors that contribute to the magnitude of placebo analgesia in an experimental paradigm.Pain. 1999; 83: 147-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, Wager et al., 2004Wager T.D.

Zubieta J.-K. Placebo effects on human mu-opioid activity during pain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 11056-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar; Figure 1). In a double-blind procedure, naloxone was administered just before the test phase, in order to have the same treatment expectations in both groups. We first tested whether our experimental manipulation resulted in a behaviorally measurable placebo analgesic effect and whether this effect would be reduced in the naloxone group. Pain ratings showed a significant main effect of condition (F(1,38) = 30.76, p < 0.001), as well as a significant group-by-condition interaction (F(1,38) = 5.53, p = 0.01; Figure 2A). More specifically, while a placebo effect was evident across the whole sample (23% reduction in pain ratings under placebo compared to control), this effect was significantly stronger in the saline group (36% reduction) than in the naloxone group (10% reduction). As can be seen in Figure 2A, the effect of naloxone was specific for the placebo condition, since the ratings for the control condition did not differ between groups. Skin conductance responses (SCR) to the painful stimulation showed a significant group-by-condition interaction in the same direction as the pain ratings (F(1,37) = 2.91, p = 0.05), again indicating that placebo analgesia was impaired by naloxone administration. Next, we tested whether BOLD responses in pain-responsive brain regions would mirror the behavioral data by showing reduced activation under the placebo condition compared to the control condition and whether this difference would in turn be reduced by naloxone. Based on previous observations, which showed that placebo effects in BOLD responses are observed in a late phase of painful stimulation (Price et al., 2007Price D.D. Craggs J. Verne G.N. Perlstein W.M. Robinson M.E. Placebo analgesia is accompanied by large reductions in pain-related brain activity in irritable bowel syndrome patients.Pain. 2007; 127: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, Wager et al., 2004Wager T.D. Rilling J.K. Smith E.E. Sokolik A. Casey K.L. Davidson R.J. Kosslyn S.M. Rose R.M. Cohen J.D. Placebo-induced changes in FMRI in the anticipation and experience of pain.Science. 2004; 303: 1162-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), we expected this effect in the second half of the 20 s pain stimulus. To obtain a global estimate of naloxone influence on neural placebo effects, we identified pain-responsive brain regions across both groups by a conjunction analysis (Table S1) and averaged the parameter estimates across all identified regions for each subject and condition. This analysis resulted in a significant group-by-condition interaction during late pain (F(1,38) = 2.84, p = 0.05; Figure 2B) but not during early pain (F(1,38) = 0.0003, n.s.), indicating that naloxone significantly reduced neural placebo effects during late pain. In a second analysis, we tested which brain regions showed significant neural placebo effects (i.e., weaker BOLD responses in the placebo condition than in the control condition) in the saline group and in which regions naloxone reduced these effects. During early pain, such effects were only observed in the insula and the basal ganglia, whereas during late pain such effects were much more widespread (Table 1): during late pain, the saline group showed significant neural placebo effects in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), the amygdala, the insula, the basal ganglia, the somatosensory cortex, and the pons. A significant reduction of these effects by naloxone was observed in the thalamus, the insula, the amygdala, the dACC, the basal ganglia, and the somatosensory cortex.Table 1BOLD Responses (Control > Placebo) in Pain-Responsive RegionsRegionxyzt Valuep ValueEarly Pain: Control > PlaceboSaline GroupBasal ganglia18883.47p < 0.001Insula−340−63.18p < 0.001Early Pain: Control > PlaceboSaline Group > Naloxone GroupBasal ganglia1214143.41p < 0.001Basal ganglia18862.86p < 0.003Insula2824−22.69p < 0.004Late Pain: Control > PlaceboSaline GroupdACC028223.43p < 0.001∗Amygdala28−6−143.33p < 0.001Insula48−4162.96p < 0.002Basal ganglia268142.87p < 0.003Insula−46−1802.83p < 0.003Basal ganglia−2810−22.82p < 0.003∗SI22−30562.82p < 0.003Insula−44−242.80p < 0.003Insula−362−62.78p < 0.003Amygdala−24−2−182.73p < 0.004∗SI−28−28622.71p < 0.004Pons2−32−342.68p < 0.004∗SI−28−28502.65p < 0.005Late Pain: Control > PlaceboSaline Group > Naloxone GroupThalamus6−1663.81p < 0.001Insula3214−63.45p < 0.001Amygdala30−6−143.41p < 0.001Insula4618123.25p < 0.001dACC−426203.14p < 0.001+Basal ganglia814−103.01p < 0.002dACC424222.99p < 0.002Thalamus−12−1242.86p < 0.003SI−28−28502.81p < 0.003dACC834182.79p < 0.003Basal ganglia−1010−102.67p < 0.005SII36−18262.64p < 0.005Thalamus6−622.64p < 0.005+Contrasts (bold typeface) are listed according to the appearance in the main text.

More importantly, we investigated whether regions implicated in descending pain control (DLPFC, rACC, amygdala, hypothalamus, PAG, and RVM) would show stronger responses under placebo as compared to control in the saline group and whether this difference would in turn be reduced by naloxone. The DLPFC showed significant activations under placebo compared to control (Table 2 and Figure 3a) as well as a modulation by naloxone. The rACC exhibited two types of responses: at a more ventral location in subgenual rACC, we observed an increase in activation under placebo as compared to control (Table 2 and Figure 3B), whereas in pregenual rACC, we observed a strong deactivation under placebo as compared to control (Table 2 and Figure 3C). Only the response in pregenual rACC was significantly affected by naloxone. While both types of rACC responses have been reported in previous fMRI studies on placebo analgesia (Bingel et al., 2006Bingel U. Lorenz J. Schoell E. Weiller C. Büchel C.

Note that the pregenual rACC is listed here although it shows a strong deactivation under placebo. To further investigate subcortical effects with higher sensitivity, we used an additional image preprocessing strategy optimized for deep-brain structures, including amygdala, hypothalamus, PAG, and RVM (see Experimental Procedures for details). In contrast to the responses in DLPFC and rACC, which were only present during the early pain phase in the saline group, we observed responses in the hypothalamus, PAG, and RVM that were similarly present during early and late pain (Table S2). Using a regressor that spanned the entire pain interval (i.e., 20 s length) resulted in significant activation in the hypothalamus (−3 −9 −7, t(76) = 3.34, p < 0.001), the PAG (−3 −35 −17, t(76) = 2.97, p < 0.002; −1 −37 −22, t(76) = 2.77, p < 0.004), and the RVM (−5 −33 −39, t(76) = 2.99, p < 0.002; corresponding to the reticular nuclei adjacent to the nucleus raphe magnus; Figure 4). Importantly, the responses in all three regions were significantly modulated by naloxone (hypothalamus: −3 −10 −7, t(76) = 2.97, p < 0.002; PAG: 0 −38 −21, t(76) = 3.05, p < 0.002; RVM: −6 −37 −40, t(76) = 3.58, p < 0.001). Next, we tested whether the strength of activation of the descending pain control network was associated with a behavioral marker of placebo analgesia (i.e., pain ratings). In the saline group, we observed significant correlations between pain ratings and BOLD responses in the hypothalamus (−4 −9 −7, t(36) = 3.86, p < 0.001; 1 −7 −11, t(36) = 3.52, p < 0.001) and the PAG (−1 −33 −11, t(36) = 3.54, p < 0.001), as well as in a region slightly more rostral to the previously observed RVM activation, possibly representing the nucleus raphe pontis (−2 −35 −29, t(36) = 2.68, p < 0.006, trend-level). In all three regions, the correlation was significantly stronger in the saline group than in the naloxone group (hypothalamus: 1 −6 −11, t(36) = 3.88, p < 0.001, −4 −10 −8, t(36) = 3.57, p < 0.001; PAG: −1 −32 −11, t(36) = 3.14, p < 0.002; nucleus raphe pontis: −1 −36 −32, t(36) = 3.07, p < 0.002). As previous studies have reported enhanced connectivity between rACC and PAG during placebo analgesia (Bingel et al., 2006Bingel U. Lorenz J. Schoell E. Weiller C. Büchel C.

We observed that the intraindividual coupling between rACC and PAG showed a significant main effect of condition (F(1,38) = 5.57, p = 0.01) and a significant group-by-condition interaction (F(1,38) = 7.73, p < 0.005). More specifically, in the saline group, rACC-PAG coupling was enhanced under placebo as compared to control, whereas this difference was abolished in the naloxone group (Figure 5A). With regard to the functional relevance of this finding, we observed that the strength of coupling under placebo showed a significantly more positive correlation with the behavioral placebo effect in the saline group than in the naloxone group (rsaline = 0.28, rnaloxone = −0.33; Z = 1.83; p = 0.03), i.e., the stronger the placebo-dependent coupling between rACC and PAG, the stronger the reported pain reduction in the saline group. Complementary to that, the strength of rACC-PAG coupling under placebo predicted placebo-dependent reductions in contralateral secondary somatosensory cortex BOLD responses in the saline group (44 −18 −30, t(36) = 3.40, p < 0.001; 38 −16 −26, t(36) = 3.13, p < 0.002; Figure 5B), and this relationship was significantly stronger than in the naloxone group (44 −18 28, t(36) = 4.80, p < 0.001 [p < 0.01 corrected]; 46 −14 26, t(36) = 3.96, p < 0.001 [p < 0.03 corrected]). Finally, if rACC-PAG coupling is involved in descending pain control, the strength of this coupling should also influence the activity of the RVM, which directly controls nociceptive processing in the dorsal horn. In line with this assumption, the strength of rACC-PAG coupling under placebo predicted stronger RVM BOLD responses under placebo compared to control in the saline group (−5 −40 −40, t(36) = 3.16, p < 0.002), and this relationship was significantly stronger than in the naloxone group (−5 −39 −39, t(36) = 3.74, p < 0.001). In summary, we observed that naloxone impaired placebo analgesia on both the behavioral and neural level, blocked placebo-induced responses in DLPFC, rACC, hypothalamus, PAG, and RVM, and abolished placebo-enhanced coupling between rACC and PAG, which predicted both behavioral and neural placebo effects in the saline group as well as opioid-dependent activation of the RVM. Our results thus delineate specific opioidergic mechanisms that configure placebo analgesia and that are disrupted by naloxone. Previous behavioral studies have shown"
https://openalex.org/W2010324884,"Mitochondria are found in all eukaryotic cells and contain their own genome (mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA). Unlike the nuclear genome, which is derived from both the egg and sperm at fertilization, the mtDNA in the embryo is derived almost exclusively from the egg; that is, it is of maternal origin. Mutations in mtDNA contribute to a diverse range of currently incurable human diseases and disorders. To establish preclinical models for new therapeutic approaches, we demonstrate here that the mitochondrial genome can be efficiently replaced in mature non-human primate oocytes (Macaca mulatta) by spindle–chromosomal complex transfer from one egg to an enucleated, mitochondrial-replete egg. The reconstructed oocytes with the mitochondrial replacement were capable of supporting normal fertilization, embryo development and produced healthy offspring. Genetic analysis confirmed that nuclear DNA in the three infants born so far originated from the spindle donors whereas mtDNA came from the cytoplast donors. No contribution of spindle donor mtDNA was detected in offspring. Spindle replacement is shown here as an efficient protocol replacing the full complement of mitochondria in newly generated embryonic stem cell lines. This approach may offer a reproductive option to prevent mtDNA disease transmission in affected families. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is passed from mother to offspring, with sperm mitochondria contributing no DNA to the embryo. Mutations in mtDNA are linked to a range of diseases including type 2 diabetes, mitochondrial myopathies and neuropathies. This paper demonstrates in a non-human primate model that a defective mitochondrial genome can be replaced by transferring the spindle–chromosome complex from one egg into an egg from which the nucleus is removed. The experiment utilized unfertilized eggs from two female rhesus macaque monkeys as 'nuclear' and 'cytoplasmic' donors. The resulting eggs were fertilized and developed into embryos that were implanted in surrogates resulting in the birth of healthy twins, named Mito and Tracker in a reference to the probes used for imaging mitochondria. This suggests a route to an assisted reproductive technology approach to preventing mtDNA disease transmission in affected families. See also the Nature Editorial on the ethical aspects of this work in the 27 August issue (Vol. 460, p. 1057 ). The mitochondrial genome is of maternal origin and mutations in mitochondrial DNA are the cause of many human diseases. The efficient replacement of the mitochondrial genome in mature non-human primate oocytes is now demonstrated. This approach may offer a reproductive option to prevent the transmission of diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA in affected families."

Due to the tissue-specific nature of miR-1/206 for skeletal muscles, we investigated the role of miR-1/206 in the development of rhabdomyosarcoma. Initially, we demonstrated that miR-1/206 expression was suppressed in rhabdomyosarcomas and found at very low levels in a rhabdomyosarcoma RD cell line. Transient transfection of miR-1/206 into cultured RD cells led to a significant decrease in cell growth and migration. Using bioinformatics, we identified two putative miR-1/206 binding sites within the 3'-untranslated region of the human c-Met mRNA. miR-1/206 was then shown to have activity on mRNA expression by targeting the c-Met 3'-untranslated region. The expression of c-Met protein was shown to be down-regulated by subsequent Western blot analysis. Conversely, up-regulation of c-Met was confirmed in tissue samples of human rhabdomyosarcoma, with its level inversely correlated with miR-1/206 expression. In vivo, miR-1/206-expressing tumor cells showed growth delay in comparison with negative control. Our results demonstrated that miR-1/206 suppressed c-Met expression in rhabdomyosarcoma and could function as a potent tumor suppressor in c-Met-overexpressing tumors. Inhibition of miR-1/206 function could contribute to aberrant cell proliferation and migration, leading to rhabdomyosarcoma development."
https://openalex.org/W2006086470,"Cyanobacteria of the Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus genera are important contributors to photosynthetic productivity in the open oceans. Recently, core photosystem II (PSII) genes were identified in cyanophages and proposed to function in photosynthesis and in increasing viral fitness by supplementing the host production of these proteins. Here we show evidence for the presence of photosystem I (PSI) genes in the genomes of viruses that infect these marine cyanobacteria, using pre-existing metagenomic data from the global ocean sampling expedition as well as from viral biomes. The seven cyanobacterial core PSI genes identified in this study, psaA, B, C, D, E, K and a unique J and F fusion, form a cluster in cyanophage genomes, suggestive of selection for a distinct function in the virus life cycle. The existence of this PSI cluster was confirmed with overlapping and long polymerase chain reaction on environmental DNA from the Northern Line Islands. Potentially, the seven proteins encoded by the viral genes are sufficient to form an intact monomeric PSI complex. Projection of viral predicted peptides on the cyanobacterial PSI crystal structure suggested that the viral-PSI components might provide a unique way of funnelling reducing power from respiratory and other electron transfer chains to the PSI."
https://openalex.org/W2140062125,"Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease affecting over 200 million people currently treated with one drug, praziquantel. A possible drug target is the seleno-protein thioredoxin-glutathione reductase (TGR), a key enzyme in the pathway of the parasite for detoxification of reactive oxygen species. The enzyme is a unique fusion of a glutaredoxin domain with a thioredoxin reductase domain, which contains a selenocysteine (Sec) as the penultimate amino acid. Auranofin (AF), a gold-containing compound already in clinical use as an anti-arthritic drug, has been shown to inhibit TGR and to substantially reduce worm burden in mice. Using x-ray crystallography we solved (at 2.5 A resolution) the structure of wild type TGR incubated with AF. The electron density maps show that the actual inhibitor is gold, released from AF. Gold is bound at three different sites not directly involving the C-terminal Sec residue; however, because the C terminus in the electron density maps is disordered, we cannot exclude the possibility that gold may also bind to Sec. To investigate the possible role of Sec in the inactivation kinetics, we tested the effect of AF on a model enzyme of the same superfamily, i.e. the naturally Sec-lacking glutathione reductase, and on truncated TGR. We demonstrate that the role of selenium in the onset of inhibition by AF is catalytic and can be mimicked by an external source of selenium (benzeneselenol). Therefore, we propose that Sec mediates the transfer of gold from its ligands in AF to the redox-active Cys couples of TGR."
https://openalex.org/W2168814200,"Cancer cells activate the biosynthesis of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) in order to sustain an increasing demand for phospholipids with appropriate acyl composition during cell replication. We have previously shown that a stable knockdown of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), the main Δ9-desaturase that converts SFA into MUFA, in cancer cells decreases the rate of lipogenesis, reduces proliferation and in vitro invasiveness, and dramatically impairs tumor formation and growth. Here we report that pharmacological inhibition of SCD1 with a novel small molecule in cancer cells promoted the activation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and the subsequent reduction of acetylCoA carboxylase activity, with a concomitant inhibition of glucose-mediated lipogenesis. The pharmacological inhibition of AMPK further decreased proliferation of SCD1-depleted cells, whereas AMPK activation restored proliferation to control levels. Addition of supraphysiological concentrations of glucose or pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, did not reverse the low proliferation rate of SCD1-ablated cancer cells. Our data suggest that cancer cells require active SCD1 to control the rate of glucose-mediated lipogenesis, and that when SCD1 activity is impaired cells downregulate SFA synthesis via AMPK-mediated inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thus preventing the harmful effects of SFA accumulation."

Proteome Res. 2005; 4: 1832-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), when probing for phosphorylation by mass spectrometry or immunoblot (Figs. 1, and 3, A and B; also Fig. 3, C and D, described below). Following phosphatase inhibitor pretreatment, cells were washed with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and then each plate was lysed and harvested in 1 ml of denaturing lysis buffer (8 m urea, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm imidazole, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 + complete mini protease inhibitor pellet (Roche)). Passing 20 times through a 20-gauge needle furthered the cell lysis and sheared the DNA. Cells were then centrifuged to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was incubated with 25 μl of a nickel-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) bead slurry 3 h to overnight, at room temperature. Protein-bound beads were then washed 4 times with wash buffer (8 m urea, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm imidazole, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.3). For mass spectrometric analysis, beads from 20 plates of the same condition were combined and the urea buffer was replaced with 50 mm NH4CO3.FIGURE 3Htt Thr-3 phosphorylation is affected by polyglutamine length and cell type. Unexpanded and expanded Htt were nickel-purified from ST14A (left two lanes of both panels) or HeLa (right two lanes of both panels) cells and analyzed for relative pThr-3 content by immunoblot (A). Thr-3 phosphorylation was detected using anti-pThr-3 (left panels) and total Htt, including modified and unmodified Htt, was determined using anti-His (right panels). pThr-3 and His signals were detected and quantified using LI-COR. pThr-3:total Htt ratios were calculated for three independent experiments in B. Whole cell extracts from ST14A cells expressing Httex1p with 25Q, 46Q, or 97Q were left untreated (−) or were treated with 100% formic acid (+) to solubilize aggregated material, and then analyzed by immunoblot using pThr-3 (top panel) and His (bottom panel) antibodies (C). pThr-3:total Htt ratios were calculated for 25Q (top bar graph), 46Q (middle bar graph), and 97Q (bottom bar graph), from three independent experiments, to determine the relative amount of pThr-3 in soluble versus total (soluble plus insoluble) Httex1p (D). wt, wild-type; FA, formic acid.

The resultant peptides were extracted from the beads using 25% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid 3 times and pooled. The samples were then concentrated by SpeedVac and acidified using 0.1% formic acid prior to mass spectrometric analysis. These samples were analyzed by reverse phase liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) on a quadropole orthogonal time-of-flight tandem (QSTAR XL) mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/PE Sciex) (28Guerrero C.

Extraction of the monoisotopc masses (m/z) of parent ions, their charge states, and their corresponding fragment ions, was performed automatically using Analyst software (Applied Biosystems). These data were then submitted for automated data base searching for protein identification using Batch-tag and MS-tag search programs in Protein Prospector (University of California, San Francisco) (29Chalkley R.J.

All post-translational modifications were confirmed by manual inspection of the MS/MS spectra. The specific Htt phosphothreonine 3 antibody (anti-pThr-3; 1:1,000) was raised against the following peptide: Ac-A(pT)LEKLMKAFESC, and double affinity purified to yield a phosphospecific antibody (New England peptide). Other primary antibodies used were: rabbit anti-actin (1:1,000; Sigma), rabbit anti-COOH-terminal Htt HF-1 (1:1000; a gift from M. MacDonald, Mass General Hospital), mouse anti-penta-His (1:200; Qiagen), sheep anti-Htt S830 (1:1,000; a gift from G. Bates, Kings College), and rat anti-Elav (1:200 dilution, Iowa Hybridoma Bank). To determine the specificity of the Htt-pThr-3 antibody, unmodified (Ac-ATLEKLMKAFESC) and Thr-3-phosphorylated (Ac-A(pT)LEKLMKAFESC) peptides were dissolved in water and directly spotted, in 10-fold increments between 1 ng and 10 μg in equal volumes, on nitrocellulose. The membrane was air dried for 30 min at room temperature. The dry membrane was stained with Ponceau to confirm similar loading for the two peptides, and then probed with anti-pThr-3 and rabbit anti-horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000; Thermo). For cell extracts, cells were lysed under denaturing conditions as described for protein purification for mass spectrometry. Protein was then nickel-purified as described above or precipitated using 20% trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and resuspended in 2× SDS gel loading buffer. Fly head extracts were prepared as described by Wolfgang et al. (30Wolfgang W.J. Miller T.W. Webster J.M. Huston J.S. Thompson L.M. Marsh J.L. Messer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11563-11568Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay, and 50 μg of protein (approximately equivalent to 5 fly heads) was loaded per lane. For mouse brain extracts, the striatum and cortex were harvested from 3 wild-type C57BL/6J mice and 5 CAG140 mice. The genotypes and CAG repeat numbers were determined by Laragen and described by Simmons et al. (31Simmons D.A. Rex C.S. Palmer L. Pandyarajan V. Fedulov V. Gall C.M. Lynch G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4906-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Tissue was homogenized in T-per extraction buffer (Piercenet) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) at 150 mg/ml with a Downs homogenizer. Following homogenization, extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected as the soluble fraction (32Green K.N. Steffan J.S. Martinez-Coria H. Sun X. Schreiber S.S. Thompson L.M. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 11500-11510Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the soluble fraction was determined by Bradford assay, and 10 μg of protein was loaded per lane. Protein extracts from cells, flies, and mice were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride or nitrocellulose membranes. The filter retardation assay was conducted as described by Green et al. (32Green K.N. Steffan J.S. Martinez-Coria H. Sun X. Schreiber S.S. Thompson L.M. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 11500-11510Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), using 5 fly head equivalents (∼50 μg) per spot. Membrane-bound proteins were detected using one of the primary antibodies listed above. Secondary antibodies used for immunoblotting were goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000; Thermo), Alexa Fluor® 680-conjugated donkey anti-sheep (1:1,000; Molecular Probes), IRDye® 800CW-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:15,000; LI-COR), IRDye® 680-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:15,000; LI-COR), IRDye 800CW-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:15,000; LI-COR), and IRDye 680-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:15,000; LI-COR). Fluorophore-conjugated antibodies were detected and quantified using an Odyssey® Imager (LI-COR). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were detected using SuperSignal West Pico (Thermo). The immunoblot signal was detected using film for horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the LI-COR was used to detect and quantify fluorophore-conjugated antibodies. All experiments quantified by the LI-COR were carried out in triplicate, using independently generated samples, and the averages and standard deviations were calculated for the three independent experiments. ST14A cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with Httex1p25Q-HBH, Httex1p46Q-HBH, or Httex1p97Q-HBH. The cells reached confluence 48 h after transfection, and the cells were treated with 20 nm calyculin A (Biomol) for 10 min prior to harvest (see Fig. 3, C and D). Cells were resuspended in denaturing lysis buffer (the same buffer used for protein purification) and homogenized by passing 20 times through a 20-gauge needle. An equal volume of cold 20% trichloroacetic acid was added to the lysates and incubated on ice for 30 min. Precipitated protein was pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 × g. Pellets were washed with acetone. Following the wash, the pellets were resuspended in 60 μl of 2× SDS gel loading buffer (control) or 60 μl of 100% formic acid. Formic acid-treated samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, dried by vacuum centrifugation, and resuspended in 60 μl of 2× SDS gel loading buffer (procedure modified from Hazeki et al. (33Hazeki N. Tukamoto T. Goto J. Kanazawa I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)). 5 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was added to control and formic acid-treated samples to neutralize the pH prior to Western analysis. ST14A cells were grown on coverslips (4 coverslips for each condition) and transiently transfected with Httex1p46Q-HBH, Httex1p46QT3A-HBH, or Httex1p46QT3D-HBH using Lipofectamine 2000. 48 h following transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeablized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin. Sheep anti-Htt (S830) was used at 1:200. A fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-sheep secondary antibody (1:250 Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc.) was used for visualization. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole counterstained the cell nuclei. Images were collected on a confocal microscope using a ×20 objective. Non-overlapping pictures containing a total of ∼300 transfected cells per coverslip were taken. The number of cells containing aggregates, divided by the total number of transfected cells, was calculated for each coverslip. Averages and standard deviations were calculated from the four coverslips per condition. Httex1p97Q, -97QT3A, and -97QT3D were cloned into the pUASTattB vector and this construct was injected into approximately one-half h old embryos of the genotype yw hs-flp; AttP-zh86Fb; vas-phi-zh 102D. This method enables site-specific integration into the same chromosomal position (in this case in 86F on the third chromosome) using the Phi-C31-mediated integration system (34Bischof J. Maeda R.K. Hediger M. Karch F. Basler K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3312-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Several homozygous lines were established for each construct using appropriate balancers. For Httex1p expression, male Htt transgenic flies were mated with females homozygous for the pan-neuronal elav driver w; P{w+mW.hs = GawB}elavC155 (Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center). The un-injected stock flies, with an identical genotype as the transgenic flies without the transgene (yw hs-flp; AttP-zh86Fb; vas-phi-zh 102D), were also crossed to elavC155 virgins to generate wild-type controls. Cultures were raised at 25 °C. Eye imaginal discs were dissected from 3rd instar larvae, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with anti-Elav (1:200) and anti-Htt (S830; 1:1000) in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies used were Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rat (1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-sheep (1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc.). Z-stack images were taken and merged using a Zeiss LSM510-META 2-photon confocal microscope. For quantification of aggregation, merged Z-stack images were cropped to equal size at the start of and parallel to Elav expression. Fluorescence from aggregated Htt was measured using Scion imaging software (Scion Corporation) after subjecting the Htt channel to grayscale and threshold commands to remove the signal from soluble Htt. Pixels containing fluorescent signal from aggregates were counted for each disc and the averages and standard deviations were calculated for at least 4 discs per transgene. Male flies homozygous for the Htt transgenes were mated to double-balanced virgin females (TM3/TM6). F1 males, containing the Htt transgene over a TM3 balancer (Htt/TM3), were crossed to elavC155 virgin female flies. Cultures were raised at 25 °C, and survival was calculated as the ratio of enclosed adults expressing the transgene to those carrying the balancer. 4- and 11-day-old female flies were decapitated and subjected to pseudopupil analysis to count the number of surviving photoreceptor neurons as previously described (35Agrawal N. Pallos J. Slepko N. Apostol B.L. Bodai L. Chang L.W. Chiang A.S. Thompson L.M. Marsh J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3777-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Female flies were used as opposed to male flies because of the low survival of males. A minimum of 6 flies per genotype were used for pseudopupil analysis. Unpaired Student's t tests were used to calculate the significance of the differences between measurements: * = p ≤ 0.05; ** = p ≤ 0.01; *** = p ≤ 0.001. To determine whether Httex1p is post-translationally modified by endogenous protein activities, we transiently transfected striatal progenitor cells, ST14A, which have properties similar to the medium spiny neurons most overtly affected in HD (26Ehrlich M.E.

https://openalex.org/W2070906481,"Background While prepubertal nutritional influences appear to play a role in sexual maturation, there is a need to clarify the potential contributions of maternal and childhood influences in setting the tempo of reproductive maturation. In the present study we employed an established model of nutritional programming to evaluate the relative influences of prenatal and postnatal nutrition on growth and ovarian function in female offspring. Methods Pregnant Wistar rats were fed either a calorie-restricted diet, a high fat diet, or a control diet during pregnancy and/or lactation. Offspring then were fed either a control or a high fat diet from the time of weaning to adulthood. Pubertal age was monitored and blood samples collected in adulthood for endocrine analyses. Results We report that in the female rat, pubertal timing and subsequent ovarian function is influenced by the animal's nutritional status in utero, with both maternal caloric restriction and maternal high fat nutrition resulting in early pubertal onset. Depending on the offspring's nutritional history during the prenatal and lactational periods, subsequent nutrition and body weight gain did not further influence offspring reproductive tempo, which was dominated by the effect of prenatal nutrition. Whereas maternal calorie restriction leads to early pubertal onset, it also leads to a reduction in adult progesterone levels later in life. In contrast, we found that maternal high fat feeding which also induces early maturation in offspring was associated with elevated progesterone concentrations. Conclusions These observations are suggestive of two distinct developmental pathways leading to the acceleration of pubertal timing but with different consequences for ovarian function. We suggest different adaptive explanations for these pathways and for their relationship to altered metabolic homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2057129777,"ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) catalyzes the conversion of adenosine to inosine, a process known as A-to-I editing. Extensive A-to-I editing has been described in viral RNAs isolated from the brains of patients persistently infected with measles virus, although the precise role of ADAR during measles virus infection remains unknown. We generated human HeLa cells stably deficient in ADAR1 (""ADAR1(kd) cells"") through short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown, and using these cells, we tested the effect of ADAR1 deficiency on measles virus (MVvac strain) growth and virus-induced cell death. We found that the growth of mutant viruses lacking expression of the viral accessory proteins V and C (V(ko) and C(ko), respectively) was decreased in ADAR1-deficient cells compared with ADAR1-sufficient cells. In addition, apoptosis was enhanced in ADAR1-deficient cells following infection with wild type and V(ko) virus but not following infection with C(ko) virus or treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha or staurosporine. Furthermore, in C(ko)-infected ADAR1-sufficient cells when ADAR1 did not protect against apoptosis, caspase cleavage of the ADAR1 p150 protein was detected. Finally, enhanced apoptosis in ADAR1(kd) cells following infection with wild type and V(ko) virus correlated with enhanced activation of PKR kinase and interferon regulatory factor IRF-3. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ADAR1 is a proviral, antiapoptotic host factor in the context of measles virus infection and suggest that the antiapoptotic activity of ADAR1 is achieved through suppression of activation of proapoptotic and double-stranded RNA-dependent activities, as exemplified by PKR and IRF-3."
https://openalex.org/W2106711012,"Non-visual arrestins play a pivotal role as adaptor proteins in regulating the signaling and trafficking of multiple classes of receptors. Although arrestin interaction with clathrin, AP-2, and phosphoinositides contributes to receptor trafficking, little is known about the configuration and dynamics of these interactions. Here, we identify a novel interface between arrestin2 and clathrin through x-ray diffraction analysis. The intrinsically disordered clathrin binding box of arrestin2 interacts with a groove between blades 1 and 2 in the clathrin beta-propeller domain, whereas an 8-amino acid splice loop found solely in the long isoform of arrestin2 (arrestin2L) interacts with a binding pocket formed by blades 4 and 5 in clathrin. The apposition of the two binding sites in arrestin2L suggests that they are exclusive and may function in higher order macromolecular structures. Biochemical analysis demonstrates direct binding of clathrin to the splice loop in arrestin2L, whereas functional analysis reveals that both binding domains contribute to the receptor-dependent redistribution of arrestin2L to clathrin-coated pits. Mutagenesis studies reveal that the clathrin binding motif in the splice loop is (L/I)(2)GXL. Taken together, these data provide a framework for understanding the dynamic interactions between arrestin2 and clathrin and reveal an essential role for this interaction in arrestin-mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1966509643,"Background To what extent do identified neurons from different animals vary in their expression of ion channel genes? In neurons of the same type, is ion channel expression highly variable and/or is there any relationship between ion channel expression that is conserved? Methodology/Principal Findings To address these questions we measured ion channel mRNA in large cells (LCs) of the crab cardiac ganglion. We cloned a calcium channel, caco, and a potassium channel, shaker. Using single-cell quantitative PCR, we measured levels of mRNA for these and 6 other different ion channels in cardiac ganglion LCs. Across the population of LCs we measured 3–9 fold ranges of mRNA levels, and we found correlations in the expression of many pairs of conductances Conclusions/Significance In previous measurements from the crab stomatogastric ganglion (STG), ion channel expression was variable, but many pairs of channels had correlated expression. However, each STG cell type had a unique combination of ion channel correlations. Our findings from the crab cardiac ganglion are similar, but the correlations in the LCs are different from those in STG neurons, supporting the idea that such correlations could be markers of cell identity or activity."
https://openalex.org/W2036500104,"Animal microRNAs (miRNAs) typically regulate gene expression by binding to partially complementary target sites in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of messenger RNA (mRNA) reducing its translation and stability. They also commonly induce shortening of the mRNA 3' poly(A) tail, which contributes to their mRNA decay promoting function. The relationship between miRNA-mediated deadenylation and translational repression has been less clear. Using transfection of reporter constructs carrying three imperfectly matching let-7 target sites in the 3' UTR into mammalian cells we observe rapid target mRNA deadenylation that precedes measureable translational repression by endogenous let-7 miRNA. Depleting cells of the argonaute co-factors RCK or TNRC6A can impair let-7-mediated repression despite ongoing mRNA deadenylation, indicating that deadenylation alone is not sufficient to effect full repression. Nevertheless, the magnitude of translational repression by let-7 is diminished when the target reporter lacks a poly(A) tail. Employing an antisense strategy to block deadenylation of target mRNA with poly(A) tail also partially impairs translational repression. On the one hand, these experiments confirm that tail removal by deadenylation is not strictly required for translational repression. On the other hand they show directly that deadenylation can augment miRNA-mediated translational repression in mammalian cells beyond stimulating mRNA decay. Taken together with published work, these results suggest a dual role of deadenylation in miRNA function: it contributes to translational repression as well as mRNA decay and is thus critically involved in establishing the quantitatively appropriate physiological response to miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2011693775,"The spread of agriculture into Europe and the ancestry of the first European farmers have been subjects of debate and controversy among geneticists, archaeologists, linguists and anthropologists. Debates have centred on the extent to which the transition was associated with the active migration of people as opposed to the diffusion of cultural practices. Recent studies have shown that patterns of human cranial shape variation can be employed as a reliable proxy for the neutral genetic relationships of human populations.Here, we employ measurements of Mesolithic (hunter-gatherers) and Neolithic (farmers) crania from Southwest Asia and Europe to test several alternative population dispersal and hunter-farmer gene-flow models. We base our alternative hypothetical models on a null evolutionary model of isolation-by-geographic and temporal distance. Partial Mantel tests were used to assess the congruence between craniometric distance and each of the geographic model matrices, while controlling for temporal distance. Our results demonstrate that the craniometric data fit a model of continuous dispersal of people (and their genes) from Southwest Asia to Europe significantly better than a null model of cultural diffusion.Therefore, this study does not support the assertion that farming in Europe solely involved the adoption of technologies and ideas from Southwest Asia by indigenous Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. Moreover, the results highlight the utility of craniometric data for assessing patterns of past population dispersal and gene flow."
https://openalex.org/W1967498380,"Background Normal aging significantly influences motor and cognitive performance. Little is known about age-related changes in action simulation. Here, we investigated the influence of aging on implicit motor imagery. Methodology/Principal Findings Twenty young (mean age: 23.9±2.8 years) and nineteen elderly (mean age: 78.3±4.5 years) subjects, all right-handed, were required to determine the laterality of hands presented in various positions. To do so, they mentally rotated their hands to match them with the hand-stimuli. We showed that: (1) elderly subjects were affected in their ability to implicitly simulate movements of the upper limbs, especially those requiring the largest amplitude of displacement and/or with strong biomechanical constraints; (2) this decline was greater for movements of the non-dominant arm than of the dominant arm. Conclusions/Significance These results extend recent findings showing age-related alterations of the explicit side of motor imagery. They suggest that a general decline in action simulation occurs with normal aging, in particular for the non-dominant side of the body."

SdhA contains the dicarboxylate-binding site and a covalently bound FAD cofactor which cycles between FAD and FADH2 redox states during succinate oxidation (6Maklashina E. Iverson T.M. Sher Y. Kotlyar V. Andréll J. Mirza O. Hudson J.M. Armstrong F.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11357-11365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The electrons from succinate oxidation are sequentially transferred via a [2Fe-2S], a [4Fe-4S], and a [3Fe-4S] iron-sulfur cluster relay system in SdhB to a quinone-binding site (QP) located at the interface of the SdhB, SdhC, and SdhD subunits. SdhC and SdhD are both composed of three transmembrane helices and coordinate a low spin b-type heme via His residues contributed by each subunit (7Vibat C.R. Cecchini G. Nakamura K. Kita K.

The first structural information about members of the Complex II family came from x-ray structures of the QFR enzymes from E. coli at 3.3 Å resolution (9Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and Wolinella succinogenes at 2.2 Å resolution (10Lancaster C.R. Kröger A. Auer M. Michel H. Nature. 1999; 402: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These structures revealed details of the overall architecture of the subunits, the position of key redox cofactors, the electron transfer pathway, and the quinone-binding sites. At around the same time, the structures of soluble fumarate reductases found in anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria and structurally homologous to the flavoprotein subunit of Complex II were solved by x-ray crystallography (1Cecchini G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 77-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Analysis of these soluble fumarate reductases has proven particularly informative in describing the mechanism of fumarate reduction and succinate oxidation at the dicarboxylate-binding site (11Taylor P. Pealing S.L. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Walkinshaw M.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Leys D. Tsapin A.S. Nealson K.H. Meyer T.E.

Acta. 2006; 1757: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Structures of SQRs lagged behind those of the QFRs until the structure of the E. coli enzyme was solved at 2.6 Å (15Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). This structure, solved in space group R32, revealed that the E. coli enzyme is packed as a trimer. The structures of the SdhA and SdhB subunits were highly similar to those of E. coli and W. succinogenes QFRs, but the transmembrane SdhC and SdhD subunits showed differences compared with their QFR counterparts. The structure revealed the position of the redox sites and the dicarboxylate- and quinone-binding (Q) sites. The heme b molecule was shown to lie away from the electron transfer pathway, suggesting electrons are preferentially transferred from the [3Fe-4S] cluster to ubiquinone, on the grounds of the edge-to-edge distances and redox potentials of the relevant groups. The structure revealed density in the Q-site that was interpreted as ubiquinone, and the position of the binding site was confirmed by the structure of the E. coli enzyme co-crystallized with the Q-site inhibitor 2-(1-methyl-hexyl)-4,6-dinitrophenol (DNP-17, PDB code 1NEN (15Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar)). The E. coli enzyme was subsequently co-crystallized with the Q-site inhibitor Atpenin A5 (AA5) (PDB code 2ACZ (16Horsefield R. Yankovskaya V. Sexton G. Whittingham W. Shiomi K. Omura S. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7309-7316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar)). This inhibitor was bound deeper into the quinone-binding site than ubiquinone or DNP-17, suggesting that there are two binding positions for ubiquinone in its binding site. The structure also identified a water-mediated proton pathway, proposed to deliver protons to the quinone-binding site. The first structure of a mitochondrial SQR was from porcine heart at 2.4 Å resolution (PDB code 1ZOY (17Sun F. Huo X. Zhai Y. Wang A. Xu J. Su D. Bartlam M. Rao Z. Cell. 2005; 121: 1043-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). This structure revealed a monomer in the asymmetric unit, suggesting that mitochondrial SQRs were likely to function as monomers. Superposition of the porcine and E. coli SQR structures revealed the high structural similarity of the SdhA and SdhB subunits and the conservation in position of the redox cofactors. Larger divergences were observed in the transmembrane subunits. Further structural information about SQRs was obtained by analysis of structures of avian SQR crystallized with oxaloacetate (2.2 Å resolution, PDB code 1YQ3), with 3-nitropropionate (2.4 Å resolution, PDB code 1YQ4), and with the Q-site inhibitor carboxin (2.1 Å resolution, PDB code 2FBW) (18Huang L.S. Sun G. Cobessi D. Wang A.C. Shen J.T. Tung E.Y. Anderson V.E. Berry E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5965-5972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). These structures revealed important differences in the position of key residues in the dicarboxylate-binding site compared with the E. coli and porcine structures. Arg-297 (equivalent to Arg-298 in porcine and Arg-286 in E. coli SQRs) was ideally located to act as a general base catalyst, accepting a proton during dehydrogenation of succinate, as in the soluble Shewanella flavocytochrome c3 (PDB code 1QJD) (11Taylor P. Pealing S.L. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Walkinshaw M.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), suggesting conservation of mechanism between these distantly related enzymes. An unusual cis-serine peptide bond was proposed to position another arginine residue for binding dicarboxylates. Density for the dicarboxylate in 1YQ3 and 2FBW was shown to be distinctly non-planar and could be modeled by the “malate-like intermediate” seen in 1QJD. The nature of the ligand in the dicarboxylate site was further analyzed in a 1.74 Å resolution structure of avian SQR (PDB code 2H88), confirming the high structural similarity of the ligand and binding site residues in the SQR and flavocytochrome c3 structures (11Taylor P. Pealing S.L. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Walkinshaw M.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Leys D. Tsapin A.S. Nealson K.H. Meyer T.E.

Acta. 2006; 1757: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Despite the structural information described above, there are still unresolved issues regarding the structure and function of SQRs and QFRs. These include the location of conserved waters, which may form a channel involved in protonation of quinone, and the ability of the Q-site to accommodate different quinones and inhibitors. To further address these issues, we pursued structure-function studies of E. coli SQR. We developed alternative crystallization conditions that provided crystals more reproducibly and diffracting to higher resolution. By exchanging the enzyme into decyl-β-d-maltoside (DM) during purification, it was possible to crystallize the enzyme in the orthorhombic P212121 space group. These crystals routinely diffracted in the 3–3.5 Å resolution range. Co-crystallization with the biochemically well characterized Q-site inhibitor carboxin improved diffraction to 2.1–2.8 Å. This structure shows new features related to the dicarboxylate-binding site of E. coli SQR including a rare cis-peptide bond in SdhA, as found in avian SQR (14Huang L.S. Shen J.T. Wang A.C. Berry E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which helps shape the geometry of the active site. Comparisons of the structure with those of SQR binding PCP and SQR with an empty Q-site show how subtle rearrangements of the Q-site accommodate the different inhibitors. The orientation of carboxin in the Q-site differs with computational predictions (16Horsefield R. Yankovskaya V. Sexton G. Whittingham W. Shiomi K. Omura S. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7309-7316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and with that seen in avian SQR (2FBW). The position of conserved water molecules around the Q-site suggests a new water-mediated proton uptake pathway consistent with recent mutational and biophysical studies (19Cheng V.W. Johnson A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9107-9116Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Carboxin (5,6-dihydro-2-methyl-1,4-oxathiin-3-carboxanilide), >99% pure, was obtained from Duchefa Biochemie, Haarlem, The Netherlands. PCP, 98% pure, was obtained from Aldrich. E. coli strain DW35 (ΔfrdABCD, sdhC::kan) was used as the host for expression of SQR as described (20Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pFAS (sdhC+D+A+B+) was used for expression of wild type and SQR mutants. Mutations were introduced using the QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) mutagenesis kit as described (20Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SQR enzyme was purified as previously described (21Törnroth S. Yankovskaya V. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 2002; 1553: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22Horsefield R. Yankovskaya V. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Stambouli E. Barber J. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Protein was diluted 50-fold to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in buffers containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and a range of detergents at a concentration of twice the critical micelle concentration. The UV-visible spectrum (250–750 nm) was measured for each sample (Beckman DU Series 700 UV-visible scanning spectrophotometer), and samples were then incubated at 20 °C. At regular time intervals, the samples were centrifuged at high speed to pellet aggregates (100,000 x g, 30 min, Beckman TLA120.1 rotor). The supernatant was recovered, and the UV-visible spectrum was measured. Incubation was then continued at 20 °C. As a result of the detergent stability assays, protein for crystallization was purified using a modification of earlier procedures (21Törnroth S. Yankovskaya V. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 2002; 1553: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22Horsefield R. Yankovskaya V. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Stambouli E. Barber J. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes containing 600–800 mg of total protein were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, Roche Applied Science Complete protease inhibitor tablets) to a concentration of about 10 mg of total protein/ml. The detergent C12E9 (Anatrace) was added to give a final concentration of 2% (w/v). The suspension was stirred briefly at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 40 min. The reddish-brown supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter (Millipore) before being applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow 26/10 column (GE Healthcare, bed volume 50 ml) equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% (w/v) C12E9). After washing with two bed volumes of buffer B and two bed volumes of buffer B with 100 mm NaCl, the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of buffer B with 100–350 mm NaCl over 6 bed volumes at 2.5 ml/min. Fractions containing SQR were selected on the basis of their A407/A280 ratio, pooled, and concentrated using a 30-kDa cutoff membrane in an Amicon Stirred Cell Concentrator. The concentrated sample was diluted in buffer A before being applied to a Poros 50HQ column (bed volume, 25 ml, Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equilibrated with buffer B. The loading and running of the column was identical to that of the Q-Sepharose column, except that the flow rate was increased to 3.5 ml/min. The pooled fractions were concentrated to 2 ml as described above. The sample was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 26/60 column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.2% (w/v) DM (Anatrace)), and run at 0.25 ml/min. SQR eluted as a single peak, and pooled fractions were concentrated to 20 mg/ml with an Amicon Centricon with a 100-kDa cutoff membrane. The sample was filtered with a 0.1-μm filter before crystallization. Initial crystal hits were found using commercially available screens (Molecular Dimensions Memstart/Memsys screen). Crystals suitable for data collection were obtained using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique. SQR was mixed in a 1:10 (v/v) ratio with the inhibitors carboxin (from a 10 mm stock solution in ethanol) or PCP (from a 5 mm stock solution in ethanol). For crystals of SQR binding carboxin, 1 μl of inhibited enzyme was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution (0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, 0.1 m Li2SO4, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.009% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 11% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000). For crystals of SQR binding PCP, the reservoir solution was modified to contain 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000. Crystals of SQR with an empty Q-site came from an unsuccessful co-crystallization trial with the inhibitor flutolanil and were grown using a reservoir solution containing 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, 0.1 m MgSO4, 10% polyethylene glycol 4000. In all cases crystals appeared overnight and were frozen within 4 days of setup using 30% glycerol as the cryoprotectant and mounted mesh LithoLoopsTM (Molecular Dimensions Ltd, UK) to support the large plate crystals. X-ray data were collected from frozen crystals at 100 K at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline ID23–1. The SQR/carboxin dataset was collected from a single position on the crystal using a 100 × 100-μm beam. The SQR/PCP and empty Q-site datasets were collected from three different positions on the respective crystals, to minimize the effects of radiation damage and increase the resolution of the complete dataset, using a 50 × 50-μm beam (PCP) or 100 × 100-μm beam (empty Q-site). Intensities were integrated using the program MOSFLM (23Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; (No. 26)Google Scholar) from the CCP4 suite (24The Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar) or XDS (25Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar) and merged using SCALA (26Evans P.R. Proceedings of CCP4 Study Weekend on Data Collection and Processing.in: Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. CLRC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 114-122Google Scholar, 27Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3661) Google Scholar). For all datasets, the space group was P212121, with a trimer of SQR molecules in the asymmetric unit. Data collection statistics are shown in supplemental Table S1. For determination of the SQR/carboxin structure, molecular replacement was done using the program PHASER (28McCoy A.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar) and the SQR coordinates in the R32 crystal form at 2.6 Å resolution (PDB code 1NEK) as a search model. Non-protein atoms were omitted from the search model and initial phase calculation. Density for carboxin was clearly visible in the maps calculated from these initial phases, giving us confidence in the molecular replacement solution and the quality of the phasing. Some flexible loops of the model, particularly in the SdhA subunit, did not fit the density maps well. Automated model building was, therefore, attempted using the programs RESOLVE in the PHENIX suite (29Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J.

Perrakis A. Wilson K.S. International Tables for Crystallography, Volume F: Crystallography of Biological Macromolecules.in: Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 720-722Google Scholar). Although neither program successfully built the whole SQR trimer in the asymmetric unit, output from the programs helped correct regions of the initial model. Rotamers were checked using the side chains option of ARP/wARP, and many side-chain conformations were rebuilt. Manual model building was performed using the programs Coot (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22527) Google Scholar) and O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar), and refinement was done using phenix. refine (34Afonine P.V. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. CCP4 Newsletter. 42. CLRC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK2005Google Scholar) and Refmac (35Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). Strict NCS restraints were applied to the protein part of the model during refinement. Coordinates and restraints for carboxin were downloaded from the PRODRG server (36Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4062) Google Scholar). Ideal coordinates for TEO were obtained from the HIC-Up data base (37Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and input to the PRODRG server to generate final coordinate and restraint files for modeling. The ligand building procedure within ARP/wARP (38Evrard G.X. Langer G.G. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was used to fit both ligands into the density maps. Water molecules were fitted using phenix.refine and Coot and validated using Coot. The model was refined to Rcryst = 19.25% and Rfree = 22.09%. TLS refinement (39Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar) was implemented in the final stages of refinement, defining each chain in the asymmetric unit as a separate TLS group. This produced a model with a final Rcryst = 17.1% and Rfree = 20.0%. The TLS model was validated using TLSANL (40Howlin B. Butler S.A. Moss D.S. Harris G.W. Driessen H.P.C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 622-624Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The final model consists of residues 1–588 of SdhA (chains A, E, and I and FADs), residues 1–238 of SdhB (chains B, F, and J and FeS clusters), residues 8–128 of SdhC (chains C, G, and K), residues 11–115 of SdhD (chains D, H, and L), 3 hemes, 3 carboxin molecules, 3 TEO molecules, 3 Na+ ions, 3 sulfates, and 1116 water molecules. The side chain of SdhD Trp 113 was truncated at the Cβ atom as density for the side chain was poor, and it was not possible to model it as a common rotamer without introducing clashes with symmetry-related side chains. Phases for the wild type/PCP and empty Q-site structures were initially determined by rigid-body refinement in REFMAC of the protein part of the wild type/carboxin model. This was followed by positional refinement in REFMAC with tight NCS restraints. For the PCP dataset, difference density for the inhibitor was clearly visible in the Q-site. Ideal coordinates for PCP were obtained from the HIC-UP data base, and restraints were generated using the SKETCHER interface to LIBCHECK. PCP was built into the density map using the ligand building procedure in ARP/wARP. The model was refined to an Rcryst = 22.2% and Rfree = 25.8%. TLS refinement, with each chain in the asymmetric unit as a separate TLS group, reduced both R factors to final values of Rcryst = 19.7% and Rfree = 22.8%. The final model consists of residues 1–588 of SdhA (chains A, E, and I and FADs), residues 1–238 of SdhB (chains B, F, and J and FeS clusters), residues 8–129 of SdhC (chains C, G, and K), residues 11–115 of SdhD (chains D, H, and L), 3 hemes, 3 PCP molecules, 3 TEO molecules, and 3 Na+ ions. For the empty Q-site structure, positional refinement with tight NCS restraints reduced Rcryst to 26.5% and Rfree to 30.3%. TLS refinement, with one TLS group per chain, produced a final model with Rcryst = 20.5% and Rfree = 23.3%. The mFo − DFc map after refinement shows a small residual density peak in the Q-site, but this cannot accommodate an inhibitor or native ubiquinone; hence, we consider this structure to show an “empty” Q-site. The final model consists of residues 1–588 of SdhA (chains A, E, and I and FADs), residues 1–238 of SdhB (chains B, F, and J and FeS clusters), residues 8–128 of SdhC (chains C, G, and K), residues 11–115 of SdhD (chains D, H, and L), 3 hemes, 3 TEO molecules, and 3 Na+ ions. Molprobity (41Davies I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall W.B. Snoeyink J. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C.

Refinement statistics for all datasets are shown in supplemental Table S1). Crystal contacts and residues involved in trimer formation were analyzed using the CCP4 program AREAIMOL. The root mean square deviation of superposed structures was determined using the CCP4 program LSQKAB. FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5 and supplemental Figs.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2288-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Succinate oxidation with the artificial electron acceptor phenazine methosulfate and the ubiquinone analogue UQ1 was coupled to reduction of dichlorophenol indophenol as previously described (20Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the key factors influencing membrane protein crystallization is the choice of detergent, which may affect protein stability and crystal packing (44Kühlbrandt W. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1988; 21: 429-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 45Wiener M.C. Methods. 2004; 34: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We, therefore, developed a simple assay described under “Experimental Procedures” to test the stability of SQR in a range of detergents. Representative experimental results are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. This assay revealed that E. coli SQR is about as stable in the maltoside detergents (dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, DM, and nonyl-β-d-maltoside) as it is in C12E9, a polyoxyethylene detergent that has been used extensively in SQR studies. As expected, E. coli SQR was slightly less stable in nonyl-β-d-maltoside compared with dodecyl-β-d-maltoside because of the shorter alkyl chain length of nonyl-β-d-maltoside. Interestingly, E. coli SQR was unstable in octyl-β-d-glucoside, aggregating quickly in this detergent even when used at low concentrations as a detergent additive in crystallization trials.

In natural communities, pathogens and hosts are typically embedded within a web of interactions with other species, which could affect indirectly the pathogen virulence and host immunity through trade-offs. Here we show that selection by predation can affect both pathogen virulence and host immune defence. Exposing opportunistic bacterial pathogen Serratia marcescens to predation by protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila decreased its virulence when measured as host moth Parasemia plantaginis survival. This was probably because the bacterial anti-predatory traits were traded off with bacterial virulence factors, such as motility or resource use efficiency. However, the host survival depended also on its allocation to warning signal that is used against avian predation. When infected with most virulent ancestral bacterial strain, host larvae with a small warning signal survived better than those with an effective large signal. This suggests that larval immune defence could be traded off with effective defence against bird predators. However, the signal size had no effect on larval survival when less virulent control or evolved strains were used for infection suggesting that anti-predatory defence against avian predators, might be less constrained when the invading pathogen is rather low in virulence. Our results demonstrate that predation can be important indirect driver of the evolution of both pathogen virulence and host immunity in communities with multiple species interactions. Thus, the pathogen virulence should be viewed as a result of both past evolutionary history, and current ecological interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2156696931,"Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an Autism Spectrum Disorder and the leading cause of mental retardation in females. RTT is caused by mutations in the Methyl CpG-Binding Protein-2 (MECP2) gene and has no treatment. Our objective is to develop viral vectors for MECP2 gene transfer into Neural Stem Cells (NSC) and neurons suitable for gene therapy of Rett Syndrome.We generated self-inactivating (SIN) retroviral vectors with the ubiquitous EF1alpha promoter avoiding known silencer elements to escape stem-cell-specific viral silencing. High efficiency NSC infection resulted in long-term EGFP expression in transduced NSC and after differentiation into neurons. Infection with Myc-tagged MECP2-isoform-specific (E1 and E2) vectors directed MeCP2 to heterochromatin of transduced NSC and neurons. In contrast, vectors with an internal mouse Mecp2 promoter (MeP) directed restricted expression only in neurons and glia and not NSC, recapitulating the endogenous expression pattern required to avoid detrimental consequences of MECP2 ectopic expression. In differentiated NSC from adult heterozygous Mecp2(tm1.1Bird)+/- female mice, 48% of neurons expressed endogenous MeCP2 due to random inactivation of the X-linked Mecp2 gene. Retroviral MECP2 transduction with EF1alpha and MeP vectors rescued expression in 95-100% of neurons resulting in increased dendrite branching function in vitro. Insulated MECP2 isoform-specific lentiviral vectors show long-term expression in NSC and their differentiated neuronal progeny, and directly infect dissociated murine cortical neurons with high efficiency.MeP vectors recapitulate the endogenous expression pattern of MeCP2 in neurons and glia. They have utility to study MeCP2 isoform-specific functions in vitro, and are effective gene therapy vectors for rescuing dendritic maturation of neurons in an ex vivo model of RTT."
https://openalex.org/W1977521853,"Background A condition vital for the consolidation and maintenance of sleep is generally reduced responsiveness to external stimuli. Despite this, the sleeper maintains a level of stimulus processing that allows to respond to potentially dangerous environmental signals. The mechanisms that subserve these contradictory functions are only incompletely understood. Methodology/Principal Findings Using combined EEG/fMRI we investigated the neural substrate of sleep protection by applying an acoustic oddball paradigm during light NREM sleep. Further, we studied the role of evoked K-complexes (KCs), an electroencephalographic hallmark of NREM sleep with a still unknown role for sleep protection. Our main results were: (1) Other than in wakefulness, rare tones did not induce a blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal increase in the auditory pathway but a strong negative BOLD response in motor areas and the amygdala. (2) Stratification of rare tones by the presence of evoked KCs detected activation of the auditory cortex, hippocampus, superior and middle frontal gyri and posterior cingulate only for rare tones followed by a KC. (3) The typical high frontocentral EEG deflections of KCs were not paralleled by a BOLD equivalent. Conclusions/Significance We observed that rare tones lead to transient disengagement of motor and amygdala responses during light NREM sleep. We interpret this as a sleep protective mechanism to delimit motor responses and to reduce the sensitivity of the amygdala towards further incoming stimuli. Evoked KCs are suggested to originate from a brain state with relatively increased stimulus processing, revealing an activity pattern resembling novelty processing as previously reported during wakefulness. The KC itself is not reflected by increased metabolic demand in BOLD based imaging, arguing that evoked KCs result from increased neural synchronicity without altered metabolic demand."
https://openalex.org/W1966043887,"Background Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is critical for the in vivo survival of factor VIII (FVIII). Since FVIII half-life correlates with VWF-antigen pre-infusion levels, we hypothesized that VWF levels are useful to predict FVIII half-life. Methodology Standardized half-life studies and analysis of pre-infusion VWF and VWF-propeptide levels were performed in a cohort of 38 patients with severe haemophilia A (FVIII <1 IU/ml), aged 15–44 years. Nineteen patients had blood-group O. Using multivariate linear regression-analysis (MVLR-analysis), the association of VWF-antigen, VWF-propeptide, age and body-weight with FVIII half-life was evaluated. Principal Findings FVIII half-life was shorter in blood-group O-patients compared to non-O-patients (11.5±2.6 h versus 14.3±3.0 h; p = 0.004). VWF-antigen levels correlated with FVIII half-life considerably better in patients with blood-group non-O than O (Pearson-rank = 0.70 and 0.47, respectively). Separate prediction models evolved from MVLR-analysis for blood-group O and non-O patients, based on VWF-antigen and VWF/propeptide ratio. Predicted half-lives deviated less than 3 h of observed half-life in 34/38 patients (89%) or less than 20% in 31/38 patients (82%). Conclusion Our approach may identify patients with shorter FVIII half-lives, and adapt treatment protocols when half-life studies are unavailable. In addition, our data indicate that survival of FVIII is determined by survival of endogenous VWF rather than VWF levels per se."
https://openalex.org/W2035528510,"Background In eukaryotes, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures that chromosomes undergoing mitosis do not segregate until they are properly attached to the microtubules of the spindle. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the mechanism underlying this surveillance mechanism in plants, by characterising the orthogolous SAC proteins BUBR1, BUB3 and MAD2 from Arabidopsis. We showed that the cell cycle-regulated BUBR1, BUB3.1 and MAD2 proteins interacted physically with each other. Furthermore, BUBR1 and MAD2 interacted specifically at chromocenters. Following SAC activation by global defects in spindle assembly, these three interacting partners localised to unattached kinetochores. In addition, in cases of ‘wait anaphase’, plant SAC proteins were associated with both kinetochores and kinetochore microtubules. Unexpectedly, BUB3.1 was also found in the phragmoplast midline during the final step of cell division in plants. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that plant BUBR1, BUB3.1 and MAD2 proteins may have the SAC protein functions conserved from yeast to humans. The association of BUB3.1 with both unattached kinetochore and phragmoplast suggests that in plant, BUB3.1 may have other roles beyond the spindle assembly checkpoint itself. Finally, this study of the SAC dynamics pinpoints uncharacterised roles of this surveillance mechanism in plant cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2028052569,"The Ras/B-Raf/C-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade is critical for the control of many fundamental cellular processes, including proliferation, survival, and differentiation. This study demonstrated that small interfering RNA-dependent knockdown of diacylglycerol kinase eta (DGKeta) impaired the Ras/B-Raf/C-Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) in HeLa cells. Conversely, the overexpression of DGKeta1 could activate the Ras/B-Raf/C-Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in a DGK activity-independent manner, suggesting that DGKeta serves as a scaffold/adaptor protein. By determining the activity of all the components of the pathway in DGKeta-silenced HeLa cells, this study revealed that DGKeta activated C-Raf but not B-Raf. Moreover, this study demonstrated that DGKeta enhanced EGF-induced heterodimerization of C-Raf with B-Raf, which transmits the signal to C-Raf. DGKeta physically interacted with B-Raf and C-Raf, regulating EGF-induced recruitment of B-Raf and C-Raf from the cytosol to membranes. The DGKeta-dependent activation of C-Raf occurred downstream or independently of the already known C-Raf modifications, such as dephosphorylation at Ser-259, phosphorylation at Ser-338, and interaction with 14-3-3 protein. Taken together, the results obtained strongly support that DGKeta acts as a novel critical regulatory component of the Ras/B-Raf/C-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade via a previously unidentified mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2022148218,"Ccr4-Not is a highly conserved multi-protein complex consisting in yeast of 9 subunits, including Not5 and the major yeast deadenylase Ccr4. It has been connected functionally in the nucleus to transcription by RNA polymerase II and in the cytoplasm to mRNA degradation. However, there has been no evidence so far that this complex is important for RNA degradation in the nucleus.In this work we point to a new role for the Ccr4-Not complex in nuclear RNA metabolism. We determine the importance of the Ccr4-Not complex for the levels of non-coding nuclear RNAs, such as mis-processed and polyadenylated snoRNAs, whose turnover depends upon the nuclear exosome and TRAMP. Consistently, mutation of both the Ccr4-Not complex and the nuclear exosome results in synthetic slow growth phenotypes. We demonstrate physical interactions between the Ccr4-Not complex and the exosome. First, Not5 co-purifies with the exosome. Second, several exosome subunits co-purify with the Ccr4-Not complex. Third, the Ccr4-Not complex is important for the integrity of large exosome-containing complexes. Finally, we reveal a connection between the Ccr4-Not complex and TRAMP through the association of the Mtr4 helicase with the Ccr4-Not complex and the importance of specific subunits of Ccr4-Not for the association of Mtr4 with the nuclear exosome subunit Rrp6.We propose a model in which the Ccr4-Not complex may provide a platform contributing to dynamic interactions between the nuclear exosome and its co-factor TRAMP. Our findings connect for the first time the different players involved in nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2074053934,"Background Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is an antioxidant enzyme, that resides on high-density lipoprotein (HDL). PON1-activity, is heavily influenced by the PON1-Q192R polymorphism. PON1 is considered to protect against atherosclerosis, but it is unclear whether this relation is independent of its carrier, HDL. In order to evaluate the atheroprotective potential of PON1, we assessed the relationships among PON1-genotype, PON1-activity and risk of future coronary artery disease (CAD), in a large prospective case-control study. Methodology/Principal Findings Cases (n = 1138) were apparently healthy men and women aged 45–79 years who developed fatal or nonfatal CAD during a mean follow-up of 6 years. Controls (n = 2237) were matched by age, sex and enrollment time. PON1-activity was similar in cases and controls (60.7±45.3 versus 62.6±45.8 U/L, p = 0.3) and correlated with HDL-cholesterol levels (r = 0.16, p<0.0001). The PON1-Q192R polymorphism had a profound impact on PON1-activity, but did not predict CAD risk (Odds Ratio [OR] per R allele 0.98[0.84–1.15], p = 0.8). Using conditional logistic regression, quartiles of PON1-activity showed a modest inverse relation with CAD risk (OR for the highest versus the lowest quartile 0.77[0.63–0.95], p = 0.01; p-trend = 0.06). PON1-activity adjusted for Q192R polymorphism correlated better with HDL-cholesterol (r = 0.26, p<0.0001) and more linearly predicted CAD risk (0.79[0.64–0.98], p = 0.03; p-trend = 0.008). However, these relationships were abolished after adjustment for HDL (particles-cholesterol-size) and apolipoproteinA-I (0.94[0.74–1.18], p-trend = 0.3). Conclusions/Significance This study, shows that PON1-activity inversely relates to CAD risk, but not independent of HDL, due to its close association with the HDL-particle. These data strongly suggest that a low PON1-activity is not a causal factor in atherogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2047296140,"Background Prioritization schemes usually highlight species-rich areas, where many species are at imminent risk of extinction. To be ecologically relevant these schemes should also include species biological traits into area-setting methods. Furthermore, in a world of limited funds for conservation, conservation action is constrained by land acquisition costs. Hence, including economic costs into conservation priorities can substantially improve their conservation cost-effectiveness. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined four global conservation scenarios for carnivores based on the joint mapping of economic costs and species biological traits. These scenarios identify the most cost-effective priority sets of ecoregions, indicating best investment opportunities for safeguarding every carnivore species, and also establish priority sets that can maximize species representation in areas harboring highly vulnerable species. We compared these results with a scenario that minimizes the total number of ecoregions required for conserving all species, irrespective of other factors. We found that cost-effective conservation investments should focus on 41 ecoregions highlighted in the scenario that consider simultaneously both ecoregion vulnerability and economic costs of land acquisition. Ecoregions included in priority sets under these criteria should yield best returns of investments since they harbor species with high extinction risk and have lower mean land cost. Conclusions/Significance Our study highlights ecoregions of particular importance for the conservation of the world's carnivores defining global conservation priorities in analyses that encompass socioeconomic and life-history factors. We consider the identification of a comprehensive priority-set of areas as a first step towards an in-situ biodiversity maintenance strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2091760438,"Sustaining life beyond Earth either on space stations or on other planets will require a clear understanding of how the space environment affects key phases of mammalian reproduction. However, because of the difficulty of doing such experiments in mammals, most studies of reproduction in space have been carried out with other taxa, such as sea urchins, fish, amphibians or birds. Here, we studied the possibility of mammalian fertilization and preimplantation development under microgravity (microG) conditions using a three-dimensional (3D) clinostat, which faithfully simulates 10(-3) G using 3D rotation. Fertilization occurred normally in vitro under microG. However, although we obtained 75 healthy offspring from microG-fertilized and -cultured embryos after transfer to recipient females, the birth rate was lower than among the 1G controls. Immunostaining demonstrated that in vitro culture under microG caused slower development and fewer trophectoderm cells than in 1G controls but did not affect polarization of the blastocyst. These results suggest for the first time that fertilization can occur normally under microG environment in a mammal, but normal preimplantation embryo development might require 1G."
https://openalex.org/W2042962268,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease of unknown etiology that involves multiple interacting cell types driven by numerous cytokines and autoimmune epitopes. Although the initiating events leading to SLE pathology are not understood, there is a growing realization that dysregulated cytokine action on immune cells plays an important role in promoting the inflammatory autoimmune state. We applied phospho-specific flow cytometry to characterize the extent to which regulation of cytokine signal transduction through the STAT family of transcription factors is disturbed during the progression of SLE. Using a panel of 10 cytokines thought to have causal roles in the disease, we measured signaling responses at the single-cell level in five immune cell types from the MRLlpr murine model. This generated a highly multiplexed view of how cytokine stimuli are processed by intracellular signaling networks in adaptive and innate immune cells during different stages of SLE pathogenesis. We report that robust changes in cytokine signal transduction occur during the progression of SLE in multiple immune cell subtypes including increased T cell responsiveness to IL-10 and ablation of Stat1 responses to IFNα, IFNγ, IL-6, and IL-21, Stat3 responses to IL-6, Stat5 responses to IL-15, and Stat6 responses to IL-4. We found increased intracellular expression of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 protein correlated with negative regulation of Stat1 responses to inflammatory cytokines. The results provide evidence of negative feedback regulation opposing inflammatory cytokines that have self-sustaining activities and suggest a cytokine-driven oscillator circuit may drive the periodic disease activity observed in many SLE patients."
https://openalex.org/W2000729330,"Humans who carry a point mutation in the gene coding for alcohol dehydrogenase-lB (ADH1B*2; Arg47His) are markedly protected against alcoholism. Although this mutation results in a 100-fold increase in enzyme activity, it has not been reported to cause higher levels of acetaldehyde, a metabolite of ethanol known to deter alcohol intake. Hence, the mechanism by which this mutation confers protection against alcoholism is unknown. To study this protective effect, the wild-type rat cDNA encoding rADH-47Arg was mutated to encode rADH-47His, mimicking the human mutation. The mutated cDNA was incorporated into an adenoviral vector and administered to genetically selected alcohol-preferring rats. The Vmax of rADH-47His was 6-fold higher (P<0.001) than that of the wild-type rADH-47Arg. Animals transduced with rAdh-47His showed a 90% (P<0.01) increase in liver ADH activity and a 50% reduction (P< 0.001) in voluntary ethanol intake. In animals transduced with rAdh-47His, administration of ethanol (1g/kg) produced a short-lived increase of arterial blood acetaldehyde concentration to levels that were 3.5- to 5-fold greater than those in animals transduced with the wild-type rAdh-47Arg vector or with a noncoding vector. This brief increase (burst) in arterial acetaldehyde concentration after ethanol ingestion may constitute the mechanism by which humans carrying the ADH1B*2 allele are protected against alcoholism.—Rivera-Meza, M., Quin-tanilla, M.

https://openalex.org/W2033619275,"There is accumulating evidence for a role of germ line variation in breast cancer metastasis. We have recently identified a novel metastasis susceptibility gene, Rrp1b (ribosomal RNA processing 1 homolog B). Overexpression of Rrp1b in a mouse mammary tumor cell line induces a gene expression signature that predicts survival in breast cancer. Here we extend the analysis of RRP1B function by demonstrating that the Rrp1b activation gene expression signature accurately predicted the outcome in three of four publicly available breast carcinoma gene expression data sets. In addition, we provide insights into the mechanism of RRP1B. Tandem affinity purification demonstrated that RRP1B physically interacts with many nucleosome binding factors, including histone H1X, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, TRIM28 (tripartite motif-containing 28), and CSDA (cold shock domain protein A). Co-immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation confirmed these interactions and also interactions with heterochromatin protein-1alpha and acetyl-histone H4 lysine 5. Finally, we investigated the effects of ectopic expression of an RRP1B allelic variant previously associated with improved survival in breast cancer. Gene expression analyses demonstrate that, compared with ectopic expression of wild type RRP1B in HeLa cells, the variant RRP1B differentially modulates various transcription factors controlled by TRIM28 and CSDA. These data suggest that RRP1B, a tumor progression and metastasis susceptibility candidate gene, is potentially a dynamic modulator of transcription and chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W1964333175,"An in-depth knowledge of the host molecules and biological pathways that contribute towards the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria would help guide the development of novel prognostics and therapeutics. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of the brain tissue during experimental cerebral malaria (ECM ) caused by Plasmodium berghei ANKA parasites in mice, a well established surrogate of human cerebral malaria, has been useful in predicting the functional classes of genes involved and pathways altered during the course of disease. To further understand the contribution of individual genes to the pathogenesis of ECM, we examined the biological relevance of three molecules -- CD14, galectin-3, and OX40 that were previously shown to be overexpressed during ECM. We find that CD14 plays a predominant role in the induction of ECM and regulation of parasite density; deletion of the CD14 gene not only prevented the onset of disease in a majority of susceptible mice (only 21% of CD14-deficient compared to 80% of wildtype mice developed ECM, p<0.0004) but also had an ameliorating effect on parasitemia (a 2 fold reduction during the cerebral phase). Furthermore, deletion of the galectin-3 gene in susceptible C57BL/6 mice resulted in partial protection from ECM (47% of galectin-3-deficient versus 93% of wildtype mice developed ECM, p<0.0073). Subsequent adherence assays suggest that galectin-3 induced pathogenesis of ECM is not mediated by the recognition and binding of galectin-3 to P. berghei ANKA parasites. A previous study of ECM has demonstrated that brain infiltrating T cells are strongly activated and are CD44(+)CD62L(-) differentiated memory T cells [1]. We find that OX40, a marker of both T cell activation and memory, is selectively upregulated in the brain during ECM and its distribution among CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells accumulated in the brain vasculature is approximately equal."
https://openalex.org/W2075339499,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs for protein synthesis. However, the aminoacylation reaction can be diverted to produce diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A), a universal pleiotropic signaling molecule needed for cell regulation pathways. The only known mechanism for Ap4A production by a tRNA synthetase is through the aminoacylation reaction intermediate aminoacyl-AMP, thus making Ap4A synthesis amino acid-dependent. Here, we demonstrate a new mechanism for Ap4A synthesis. Crystal structures and biochemical analyses show that human glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) produces Ap4A by direct condensation of two ATPs, independent of glycine concentration. Interestingly, whereas the first ATP-binding pocket is conserved for all class II tRNA synthetases, the second ATP pocket is formed by an insertion domain that is unique to GlyRS, suggesting that GlyRS is the only tRNA synthetase catalyzing direct Ap4A synthesis. A special role for GlyRS in Ap4A homeostasis is proposed."

Here we have characterized eIF4E from the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni. Schistosome mRNAs have either the typical monomethylguanosine (m7G) or a trimethylguanosine (m2,2,7G) cap derived from spliced leader trans-splicing. Quantitative fluorescence titration analyses demonstrated that schistosome eIF4E has similar binding specificity for both caps. We present the first crystal structure of an eIF4E with similar binding specificity for m7G and m2,2,7G caps. The eIF4E·m7GpppG structure demonstrates that the schistosome protein binds monomethyl cap in a manner similar to that of single specificity eIF4Es and exhibits a structure similar to other known eIF4Es.

Recognition of the mRNA cap by eIF4E is the key and rate-limiting step in mRNA translation. The majority of translation in eukaryotic cells is cap-dependent; that is recruitment of mRNAs to the ribosome for translation is dependent on the interaction between eIF4E and the mRNA cap. eIF4E directly binds to the mRNA cap. However, for productive translation initiation to occur, eIF4E must interact with eIF4G. eIF4G acts as a bridge protein interacting with factors in the 40 S ribosomal subunit that facilitate ribosome recruitment to the mRNA.

The eIF4E core resembles a “cupped hand” within which the cap-binding pocket residues are located. A key component of eIF4E cap-binding involves sandwiched stacking of the methylated guanine ring between two aromatic tryptophan residues at the top and bottom of the cupped hand that holds the guanine in place through interactions between the ring systems. Several other cap-binding proteins also involve stacking of the cap between aromatic residues as part of their mechanism of cap binding (35Fechter P. Brownlee G.G. J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36Gu M. Lima C.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 37Quiocho F.A. Hu G. Gershon P.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The N-7 methyl group on the guanosine cap introduces a positive charge to this moiety that greatly enhances the stacking interaction and stabilizes the complex (25Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C.

Biol. 2002; 319: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). eIF4E does not effectively recognize unmethylated guanosine phosphate and requires more than one phosphate residue on the N-7 methylated guanosine (1Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). The mRNA cap is further stabilized inside the eIF4E cap-binding pocket by hydrogen bonds derived from the side chain carboxylate of a conserved glutamic acid, a backbone NH of one of the stacking tryptophans, and additional bonds derived from conserved eIF4E residues with the three phosphate groups and the ribose of the cap (30Niedzwiecka A. Marcotrigiano J. Stepinski J. Jankowska-Anyszka M. Wyslouch-Cieszynska A. Dadlez M. Gingras A.C. Mak P. Darzynkiewicz E. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Stolarski R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). van der Waals contacts also contribute to cap stabilization including contact from a third conserved tryptophan with the N-7 methyl group. Despite this understanding of how eIF4E recognizes the monomethyl cap, the mechanism by which eIF4E proteins from trans-splicing organisms recognize and bind the alternate m2,2,7G cap is not known. Here we describe the cloning, expression, and characterization of the sole form of eIF4E in the human parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni. Schistosomes infect ∼200 million people resulting in significant morbidity, and an estimated 800 million people are at risk of infection (16Savioli L. Albonico M. Engels D. Montresor A. Parasitol. Int. 2004; 53: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Hotez P.J. Forgotten People, Forgotten Diseases: the Neglected Tropical Diseases and Their Impact on Global Health and Development. American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Press, Herndon, VA2008Crossref Google Scholar). Schistosome eIF4E exhibits dual cap specificity with similar binding affinity for both m7GpppG and m2,2,7GpppG caps. As a first step in understanding the biochemical and biophysical basis for recognition of the m2,2,7G cap in some forms of eIF4E, we determined the high resolution crystal structure of schistosome eIF4E in complex with m7GpppG or m7GpppA. In addition, we used NMR, fluorescence titration, and isothermal titration calorimetry studies to obtain insights into the ability of schistosome eIF4E to bind the atypical m2,2,7G cap. These studies provide the basis for understanding recognition of the m2,2,7G cap by a diverse group of important parasitic worms and provide general insights into the key cap-binding protein eIF4E. Sequences encoding the S. mansoni eIF4E were identified in public genomic and expressed sequence tag databases (38Berriman M. Haas B.J. LoVerde P.T. Wilson R.A. Dillon G.P. Cerqueira G.C.

These sequences were used to design primers corresponding to the full eIF4E open reading frame (5′ = ATGACGGCTGTTGAGAGT and 3′ = CTAAATTTCATATTTTCCAGTAC). The primers were used to PCR amplify the open reading frame from cDNA prepared by random priming of adult schistosome RNA (40Cohen L.S. Mikhli C. Jiao X. Kiledjian M. Kunkel G. Davis R.E. Mol. Cell.

Initial protein expression and purification were carried out in RosettaTM 2(DE3) cells induced at 30 °C for 3 h with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. The protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and used for cap analog-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (19Lall S. Friedman C.C. Jankowska-Anyszka M. Stepinski J.

Protein for fluorescent titration studies was prepared from bacterial cultures induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at A600 = 0.7 and incubated overnight at 25 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 × g, suspended in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA), sonicated, and clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto m7GTP-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was washed with the binding buffer, and eIF4E was eluted with 2 m KCl in binding buffer. The eluted protein was applied to a Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated in binding buffer, and monomeric protein was collected, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and concentrated using an Amicon 10,000 molecular weight Ultra Centrifugal Filter Device (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Sepharose affinity assays were carried out as described previously (19Lall S. Friedman C.C. Jankowska-Anyszka M. Stepinski J. Darzynkiewicz E. Davis R.E. J. Biol.

After incubation on a Nutator at 4 °C for 1 h, the resin was washed three times with 100 μl of binding buffer, and the protein was then eluted by addition of 20 μl of binding buffer with 200 μm cap analog. Eluted protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fluorescence titration was performed using a FluoroMax-3 spectrophotometer (Horiba Ltd.) with full-length eIF4E at 20 °C and a protein concentration of 0.4 μm in binding buffer. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm (slit, 1 nm), and the emission wavelength was 335 nm (slit, 2 nm). The temperature was kept at 20 °C with a thermocouple inside a thermostated cuvette, and the sample was stirred magnetically. Assays were performed by addition of 1 μl of increasing concentrations of cap analog to 1400 μl of protein solution using an integration time of 30 s and a gap of 60 s. Dilution during the titration did not exceed 2.5%. Fluorescence intensity was corrected for the inner filter effect, and the emission of the free cap analogs was explicitly included in the numerical analysis. A theoretical curve for the fluorescence intensity as a function of the total ligand concentration was fitted to the experimental data points by means of non-linear, least squares method using Prism 3.02 (GraphPad Software) as described previously (9Niedzwiecka A.

Because of the flexibility of the eIF4E N terminus, most eIF4E crystals have been produced and the structures have been solved using N-terminal truncated proteins (25Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C.

From eIF4E sequence alignments and limited trypsin digestions, we chose to truncate the schistosome protein by 22 residues at the N terminus to generate schistosome eIF4E-(23-203). This coding region was subcloned into pGEX6P-1 (GE Healthcare) using EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites and then transformed into Escherichia coli strain XA90. Protein expression was induced, the cells were collected and sonicated, and the supernatant was recovered as described above except that phosphate-buffered saline buffer was used. The cell lysate was incubated with Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) for 4 h at 4 °C with rotation. The resin was washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and eIF4E was cleaved from the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein by incubation with PreScission Protease at 4 °C overnight. Eluted protein was further purified as described above on a Superdex 75 column. Schistosome eIF4E-(23–203) was concentrated to 10 mg/ml (Amicon 10,000 molecular weight Ultra Centrifugal Filter Device) and then incubated with 1 mm 4E-BP peptide (SGSGRIIYDRKFLMECRNSPV, corresponding to residues 51–67 of the human 4E-BP1 sequence) and 0.5 mm m7GpppA or m7GpppG cap analogs at 4 °C for 1 h before crystallization setup using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Thin platelike crystals developed in 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m MgCl2, 100 mm MOPS, pH 6.0–6.5 at 4 °C within 1 week using 0.5 ml of 750 mm NaCl as the well solution. Before the data collection, the crystal was transferred into the equivalent mother solution containing 30% polyethylene glycol 4000 for 15 min and then flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Crystallographic data were collected using the mail-in data collection program at the Advanced Light Source beamline 4.2.2 at the Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory. The structure of schistosome eIF4E-(23-203) was solved by the molecular replacement method using human eIF4E (Protein Data Bank code 2V8W) as a model and the program PHASER in the CCP4 suite (42Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Model building and manual refinement were performed in COOT (43Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank for schistosome eIF4E·m7GpppG·4E-BP complex (Protein Data Bank code 3HXI) and schistosome eIF4E·m7GpppA·4E-BP complex (Protein Data Bank code 3HXG). Full-length schistosome eIF4E protein was purified by a refolding method. The induction was done as described above, and the bacterial pellet was dissolved in denaturant solution (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 6 m guanidine HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA). The protein solution was then diluted 10-fold into refolding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 1 m arginine, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Following centrifugation at 16,000 × g, the supernatant was dialyzed overnight against binding buffer and then mixed with m7GTP-Sepharose. Protein was eluted with 2 m KCl and further purified on Superdex 75 using NMR buffer (50 mm pH 7.4 phosphate, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA). Isotopically enriched schistosome eIF4E was prepared by growing cells in minimal M9 medium containing 15NH4Cl and/or [13C6]glucose. To prepare uniformly labeled schistosome eIF4E, host cells were grown in M9 minimum D2O medium supplemented with 1g/liter 2H,15N,13C-labeled ISOGRO® (ISOTECTM, Miamisburg, OH). All NMR spectra were acquired on a 900-MHz Varian spectrometer using 0.6 mm triple labeled sample (2H,15N,13C) at a probe temperature of 25 °C. For the backbone assignment, standard three-dimensional resonance NMR experiments were conducted including HNCACB, HNCOCA, HNCOCACB, 15N NOESY-HSQC, and 15N-HSQC-NOESY-HSQC. For NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments, two-dimensional 15N HSQC were collected using 0.2 mm 15N-labeled sample supplemented with m7GpppG or m2,2,7GpppG cap analogs (45Stepinski J.

The N-terminal truncated protein (25 μm) used for crystallization studies in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl was used in titration experiments carried out at 20 °C using a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). Each titration experiment consisted of a 5-μl injection followed by 29 injections of 10 μl of 700 μm cap analog. All the data were processed using the single binding site model in Origin (Version 7.0, MicroCal Inc.). Control titration experiments were performed and subtracted (cap titrated into buffer) from the titrations for enthalpy changes due to dilution. Sequence searches for eIF4E in comprehensive genomic and expressed sequence tag databases identified only a single isoform of eIF4E in S. mansoni or a second schistosome species, Schistosoma japonicum (38Berriman M.

https://openalex.org/W2112576859,"Glyoxalase I is a metalloenzyme of the glyoxalase pathway that plays a central role in eliminating the toxic metabolite methyglyoxal. The protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani possesses a unique trypanothione dependent glyoxalase system.Analysis of the L. donovani GLOI sequence predicted a mitochondrial targeting sequence, suggesting that the enzyme is likely to be targeted to the mitochondria. In order to determine definitively the intracellular localization of GLOI in L. donovani, a full-length GLOI gene was fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene to generate a chimeric construct. Confocal microscopy of L. donovani promastigotes carrying this chimeric construct and immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-GLOI antibodies demonstrated that GLOI is localized in the kinetoplast of the parasite apart from the cytosol. To study the physiological role of GLOI in Leishmania, we first created promastigote mutants heterozygous for GLOI by targeted gene replacement using either hygromycin or neomycin phosphotransferases as selectable markers. Heterozygous mutants of L. donovani display a slower growth rate, have lower glyoxalase I activity and have reduced ability to detoxify methylglyoxal in comparison to the wild-type parasites. Complementation of the heterozygous mutant with an episomal GLOI construct showed the restoration of heterozygous mutant phenotype nearly fully to that of the wild-type. Null mutants were obtained only after GLOI was expressed from an episome in heterozygous mutants.We for the first time report localization of GLOI in L. donovani in the kinetoplast. To study the physiological role of GLOI in Leishmania, we have generated GLOI attenuated strains by targeted gene replacement and report that GLOI is likely to be an important gene since GLOI mutants in L. donovani showed altered phenotype.

Misfolding of recombinant PrPC in the absence of PrPRes template, cellular factors, denaturing agents, or at neutral pH has not been achieved. A number of studies indicate that dimerization of PrPC may be a key step in the aggregation process. In an effort to understand the molecular event that may activate misfolding of PrPC in more relevant physiological conditions, we tested if enforced dimerization of PrPC may induce a conformational change reminiscent of the conversion of PrPC to PrPRes. We used a well described inducible dimerization strategy whereby a chimeric PrPC composed of a modified FK506-binding protein (Fv) fused with PrPC and termed Fv-PrP is incubated in the presence of a monomeric FK506 or dimerizing AP20187 ligand. Addition of AP20187 but not FK506 to recombinant Fv-PrP (rFv-PrP) in physiological-like conditions resulted in a rapid conformational change characterized by an increase in β-sheet structure and simultaneous aggregation of the protein. Aggregates were partially resistant to proteinase K and induced the conversion of soluble rFv-PrP in serial seeding experiments. As judged from thioflavin T binding and electron microscopy, aggregates converted to amyloid fibers. Aggregates were toxic to cultured cells, whereas soluble rFv-PrP and amyloid fibers were harmless. This study strongly supports the proposition that dimerization of PrPC is a key pathological primary event in the conversion of PrPC and may initiate the pathogenesis of prion diseases.

These diseases include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. In humans, these disorders can appear in three forms, sporadic, genetic, and iatrogenic. All forms involve modification of the normal prion protein (PrPC), a secreted glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored sialoglycoprotein, into a disease-causing prion protein (PrPRes) (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5088) Google Scholar). Although the primary structures of PrPC and PrPRes have been found to be identical (2Stahl N.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1991-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) the two isoforms have considerably different physiochemical properties. PrPC is monomeric and degradable by proteinase K (PK), whereas PrPRes exists as insoluble aggregates that show dramatically increased resistance to digestion by PK (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5088) Google Scholar). Furthermore, spectroscopic data indicate that the two prion protein isoforms are characterized by different secondary structures; PrPC is largely α-helical, whereas PrPRes is rich in β-sheet structure (3Caughey B.W.

In designing strategies to prevent the propagation and the progression of TSEs, it is important to determine the molecular pathway leading to the aggregation of PrPC.Substantial efforts have been devoted to reconstitute de novo misfolding of PrPC and prion infectivity and/or toxicity. In the first approach, PrPRes was amplified in PrPRes-dependent conversion reaction experimental conditions (see Refs. 5Supattapone S. J. Mol.

Experiments included the use of ionic or non-ionic detergents, or repeated sonication steps, or shaking for a long period of time.

Addition of lipids to rPrP also induces a conformational change into a form reminiscent of PrPRes (13Wang F. Yang F. Hu Y. Wang X. Wang X. Jin C. Ma J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, low concentrations of SDS induce a structural transition of PrP into a pathogenic conformation (14Leffers K.W. Wille H. Stöhr J. Junger E. Prusiner S.B. Riesner D. Biol.

These approaches allowed purified PrPC or rPrP to undergo a transition to an oligomeric β-sheet-rich structure with essential physiochemical properties similar to those of PrPRes and, in some instances, to reconstitute infectivity (16Legname G.

Recently, thermal refolding and expression of PrP in form of a tandem repeat resulted in the formation of soluble oligomers with high β-sheet content (15Simoneau S. Rezaei H. Salès N.

In vitro PrP conversion techniques have already contributed significant insights into the molecular mechanisms of prion diseases. However, an important issue remains unresolved: physiological circumstances mimicking in vitro conditions used to induce misfolding of PrPC are unlikely to occur in vivo. Thus, elucidating what molecular event may induce the aggregation of PrPC in physiologically relevant conditions remains an important challenge.In acquired TSEs, PrPRes physically interacts with PrPC and may force PrPC molecules to dimerize/oligomerize and aggregate (19Prusiner S.B.

Cell. 2003; 113: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that dimerization may be a key step toward aggregation of PrPC in vivo. In favor of this hypothesis, several observations indicate that PrP can form dimers that could be intermediate states in PrPRes formation (23Tompa P. Tusnády G.E. Friedrich P. Simon I. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1711-1718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, we used a well described chemical dimerization strategy to test this proposition. In this technology, a synthetic homodimerizing ligand termed AP20187 binds to and cross-links two FK506 binding domains (Fv). A fusion protein between PrPC and Fv was engineered, and addition of AP20187to cultured cells expressing Fv-PrP resulted in the formation of extracellular deposits that are insoluble in non-ionic detergents and partially resistant to PK (24Goggin K. Bissonnette C. Grenier C. Volkov L. Roucou X. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrated that homologous interactions between PrP molecules constitute a minimal and sufficient molecular event leading to PrP aggregation and extracellular deposition of aggregates, at least in cultured cells. Dimerization-induced aggregation of PrP may either be an intrinsic property of the protein, or require other cellular factors. In the present study, we addressed this issue by inducing the dimerization of purified recombinant Fv-PrP (rFv-PrP) in physiological-like conditions. We show that addition of AP20187 but not control monomeric FK506 to rFv-PrP results in spontaneous misfolding and aggregation as judged by an increase in turbidity, by differential centrifugation, and by electron microscopy. CD experiments confirmed that AP20187 induces a structural conversion characterized by a decrease in α-helices and a concomitant increase in β-sheets. Furthermore, rFv-PrP aggregates induced the conversion of soluble rFv-PrP in serial seeding experiments. These results demonstrate that dimerization is a sufficient molecular event responsible for initiating misfolding and aggregation of PrP in vitro and support the hypothesis that dimerization of PrPC is a possible initial step in the pathogenesis of prion diseases.DISCUSSIONMisfolding of PrPC is the central pathogenic event in TSEs, yet what triggers de novo conformational change and aggregation of the protein in physiological conditions (e.g. no sonication, no chaotropic or denaturing agent, neutral pH) and in the absence of PrPRes remains unknown. The most important finding of this study is the recognition of dimerization as a minimal and sufficient mechanism leading to spontaneous aggregation of PrP in physiological conditions. Furthermore, dimerization-induced aggregation is an intrinsic property of PrP, because it occurs in vitro using the purified recombinant protein.Several lines of evidence indicate that dimerization-induced misfolding of PrPC may be relevant to the aggregation of the protein in prion diseases. First, our findings are consistent with previous reports based on theoretical and experimental data suggesting that dimerization has an important role in conformational change of PrPC (reviewed in Ref. 23Tompa P. Tusnády G.E. Friedrich P. Simon I. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1711-1718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have directly tested and confirmed this hypothesis by using a conditional dimerization strategy. Most importantly, aggregates obtained after dimerization of rFv-PrP display seeded activity in amyloid fibrils formation and quaking conversion assays. Second, the proposition that dimerization may be a key event in PrP aggregation implies that PrP dimers should exist in both physiological and pathological conditions. Indeed, the presence of PrP dimers has been detected in non-infected hamster and mouse brains (42Bendheim P.E. Bolton D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 2214-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and in murine neuroblastoma cell line expressing hamster PrP (43Priola S.A. Caughey B. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3299-3305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Dimers were also detected in Creutzfeldt-Jakob infectious material disaggregated in gentle conditions (44Sklaviadis T.K. Manuelidis L. Manuelidis E.E. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1212-1222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in infected hamster brains (43Priola S.A. Caughey B. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3299-3305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Third, monomeric rPrP is able to spontaneously dimerize during its crystallization process (45Knaus K.J. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Malone M. Surewicz W.K. Yee V.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The structure of the dimer suggested that dimerization may constitute an important step in the conversion PrPC → PrPRes. Finally, an in vitro study on the mechanism of PrP assembly into amyloid demonstrated that the precursor exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium (46Stöhr J. Weinmann N. Wille H. Kaimann T. Nagel-Steger L. Birkmann E. Panza G. Prusiner S.B. Eigen M. Riesner D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 2409-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The contact sites in the dimer were identified to residues 90–106 and 152–156.What may trigger the dimerization of PrPC in prion diseases? In TSEs acquired by infection, PrPRes interacts with and could force the dimerization/oligomerization of PrPC molecules (22Meier P. Genoud N. Prinz M. Maissen M. Rülicke T. Zurbriggen A. Raeber A.J. Aguzzi A. Cell. 2003; 113: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 47Solforosi L. Bellon A. Schaller M. Cruite J.T. Abalos G.C. Williamson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7465-7471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 48Abalos G.C. Cruite J.T. Bellon A. Hemmers S. Akagi J. Mastrianni J.A. Williamson R.A. Solforosi L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34021-34028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In TSEs non-acquired by infection, dimerization of PrPC may be triggered either by an unknown ligand (49Ho J.G. Kitov P.I. Paszkiewicz E. Sadowska J. Bundle D.R. Ng K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31999-32008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), or by the concentration of the protein in a restricted environment.Our thermodynamic data indicate that the population of rFv-PrP dimers are more stable than that of the soluble monomers. A progressive increase in the entropy of reaction (Table 2) is a consequence of the disruption of a hierarchy of different kinds of intermolecular interactions (hydrogen bonds, electrostatic, dispersion forces, and disulfide bridges) at the monomer-monomer interface. This evolution of internal dynamics in association with strong hydrophobic forces helps the system to cross the energy barriers according to the energy landscape model (50Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3706) Google Scholar). This can result in the formation of a stable “seed,” which serves as a template for other soluble monomers. A global structural transformation in population of soluble rFv-PrP monomers shifts the equilibrium toward the massive rFv-PrP aggregation and subsequent amyloid fibril formation.It is noteworthy that dimerization-induced aggregates form ThT-positive structures with typical amyloid morphology after 48 h of incubation. Previous reports describing the production of amyloid fibers from rPrP are all associated with the use of denaturants, elevated temperatures, or a combination of phospholipids bicelles and elevated temperature (11Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Parfenov A.S. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 645-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 51Bocharova O.V. Makarava N. Breydo L. Anderson M. Salnikov V.V.

Biol. 2006; 357: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our observation indicates that dimerization-induced aggregates are competent to form amyloids and demonstrate that it is possible to achieve the generation of PrP amyloid fibers in vitro in physiological-like conditions.Another interesting finding in this study is that rFv-PrP aggregates but not amyloids are cytotoxic. This result confirms previous evidence that small aggregates rather than amyloids are the toxic species in prion diseases and in other neurodegenerative diseases (3Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 15Simoneau S. Rezaei H. Salès N. Kaiser-Schulz G. Lefebvre-Roque M. Vidal C.

Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (3811) Google Scholar) and underscores the relevance of dimerization in prion diseases.From our results, it is tempting to speculate that dimerization of PrPC in vivo would be a noxious event. This hypothesis is comforted by the observation that enforced dimerization of PrPC using cross-linking antibodies results in neuronal toxicity in mice (54Solforosi L. Criado J.R. McGavern D.B. Wirz S. Sánchez-Alavez M. Sugama S. DeGiorgio L.A. Volpe B.T. Wiseman E. Abalos G. Masliah E. Gilden D. Oldstone M.B. Conti B. Williamson R.A. Science. 2004; 303: 1514-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In that study, the presence of PrP aggregates was not investigated. However, in contrast to chemical dimerization, it is likely that cross-linking antibody-mediated dimerization may interfere with further conformational changes and aggregation.The present study establishes dimerization of PrPC as a potential toxic mechanism in TSEs. Future therapeutic strategies may be aimed at preventing the contact between PrPC monomers.

Cell. 2003; 113: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that dimerization may be a key step toward aggregation of PrPC in vivo. In favor of this hypothesis, several observations indicate that PrP can form dimers that could be intermediate states in PrPRes formation (23Tompa P. Tusnády G.E. Friedrich P. Simon I. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1711-1718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, we used a well described chemical dimerization strategy to test this proposition. In this technology, a synthetic homodimerizing ligand termed AP20187 binds to and cross-links two FK506 binding domains (Fv). A fusion protein between PrPC and Fv was engineered, and addition of AP20187to cultured cells expressing Fv-PrP resulted in the formation of extracellular deposits that are insoluble in non-ionic detergents and partially resistant to PK (24Goggin K. Bissonnette C. Grenier C. Volkov L. Roucou X. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrated that homologous interactions between PrP molecules constitute a minimal and sufficient molecular event leading to PrP aggregation and extracellular deposition of aggregates, at least in cultured cells. Dimerization-induced aggregation of PrP may either be an intrinsic property of the protein, or require other cellular factors. In the present study, we addressed this issue by inducing the dimerization of purified recombinant Fv-PrP (rFv-PrP) in physiological-like conditions. We show that addition of AP20187 but not control monomeric FK506 to rFv-PrP results in spontaneous misfolding and aggregation as judged by an increase in turbidity, by differential centrifugation, and by electron microscopy. CD experiments confirmed that AP20187 induces a structural conversion characterized by a decrease in α-helices and a concomitant increase in β-sheets. Furthermore, rFv-PrP aggregates induced the conversion of soluble rFv-PrP in serial seeding experiments. These results demonstrate that dimerization is a sufficient molecular event responsible for initiating misfolding and aggregation of PrP in vitro and support the hypothesis that dimerization of PrPC is a possible initial step in the pathogenesis of prion diseases.

Here we report that POSH stimulates the ubiquitination of Kir1.1 (ROMK) and enhances the internalization of this potassium channel. Immunostaining reveals the expression of POSH in the renal cortical collecting duct. Immunoprecipitation of renal tissue lysate with ROMK antibody and glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments demonstrated the association between ROMK and POSH. Moreover, immunoprecipitation of lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with ROMK1 or with constructs encoding the ROMK-N terminus or ROMK1-C-Terminus demonstrated that POSH binds to ROMK1 on its N terminus. To study the effect of POSH on ROMK1 channels, we measured potassium currents with electrophysiological methods in HEK293T cells and in oocytes transfected or injected with ROMK1 and POSH. POSH decreased potassium currents, and the inhibitory effect of POSH on ROMK channels was dose-dependent. Biotinylation assay further showed that POSH decreased surface expression of ROMK channels in HEK293T cells transfected with ROMK1 and POSH. The effect of POSH on ROMK1 channels was specific because POSH did not inhibit sodium current in oocytes injected with ENaC-α, β, and γ subunits. Moreover, POSH still decreased the potassium current in oocytes injected with a ROMK1 mutant (R1Δ373–378), in which a clathrin-dependent tyrosine-based internalization signal residing between amino acid residues 373 and 378 is deleted. However, the inhibitory effect of POSH on ROMK channels was absent in cells expressing with dominant negative dynamin and POSHΔRING, in which the RING domain was deleted. Expression of POSH also increased the ubiquitination of ROMK1, whereas expression of POSHΔRING diminished its ubiquitination in HEK293T cells. The notion that POSH may serve as an E3 ubiquitin ligase is also supported by in vitro ubiquitination assays in which adding POSH increased the ROMK ubiquitination. We conclude that POSH inhibits ROMK channels by enhancing dynamin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytosis and by stimulating ubiquitination of ROMK channels.

ROMK channels (Kir1.1) are located in the apical membrane of the epithelial cells of the renal thick ascending limb (TAL) 2The abbreviations used are: TALthick ascending limbE1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin carrier proteinE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseCCDcortical collecting ductGSTglutathione S-transferasePTKprotein-tyrosine kinaseENaCepithelial sodium channelPBSphosphate-buffered salineGFPgreen fluorescent proteinwtwild typeSGKserum-glucocorticoid-induced kinase. and the CCD, where they are responsible for potassium recycling across the apical membrane in the TAL and potassium secretion in the CCD (1Hebert S.C.

The expression of ROMK channels in the plasma membrane in the CCD is regulated by a variety of factors including protein kinases and dietary potassium intake (3Yoo D. Kim B.Y. Campo C. Nance L.

Several studies have demonstrated that potassium restriction decreased, and high potassium intake increased, the ROMK channel expression in the apical membrane of CCD epithelial cells (12Wei Y.

Although the mechanism by which dietary potassium intake regulates surface expression is not completely understood, one possible mechanism is through modulating the ubiquitination of ROMK channels. The role for ubiquitination in regulating channel surface expression and endocytosis is best demonstrated by the observation that NEDD-4, an E3 ligase that contains the HECT domain (homologous to E6-AP C-terminal), regulates the ubiquitination of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) (14Staub O.

However, because ROMK channels lack a PY motif, it is unlikely that Nedd4 regulates ROMK channels in this fashion. POSH is a RING (really interesting new gene)-containing scaffold protein and has been suggested to be an E3 ligase for Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) and Herp (homocystein-induced ER protein), and it has been shown to play an obligate role in cellular production of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 virus (23Alroy I.

Sprague-Dawley rats (6 weeks, either sex) were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY). The rats were maintained on rat chow with free access to water. The animals (<90 g) were anesthetized through intraperitoneal injection of Nembutal (6 mg/100 g) and euthanized by cervical dislocation. After opening the abdomen, both kidneys were removed immediately. The animal use protocol was approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of New York Medical College. The renal cortex and the outer medulla were separated under a dissecting microscope and suspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer solution (1:8 ratio, w/v) containing 1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS. 10 μl of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 mg/ml stock solution in isopropanol) and 10 μl of a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma) were added per ml of buffer at the time of lysis. The samples were homogenized on ice for 15 min with a mortar and pestle. The suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in the presence of DNase (5 μg/ml) followed by centrifugation at 1800 rpm for 10 min, and the resultant supernatant was collected. Protein concentrations were measured in duplicate using a Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit. Xenopus laevis females were obtained from NASCO (Fort Atkinson, WI). The method for obtaining oocytes has been described previously (26Macica C.M. Yang Y.H. Hebert S.C. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1996; 271: F588-F594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viable oocytes were selected for injection with different cRNA. The oocytes were incubated at 19 °C in a 66% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium with freshly added 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Two electrode voltage clamp experiments were performed on days 1–2 after injection. A Warner oocyte clamp OC-725C was used to measure the whole cell potassium current. Voltage and current microelectrodes were filled with 1000 mm KCl and had a resistance of less than 2 mΩ. The current was recorded on a chart recorder (Gould TA240). To exclude leak currents, 2 mm Ba2+ was used to determine the Ba2+-sensitive K+ current. Proteins in homogenates of renal tissue or in lysates of cultured cells were separated by electrophoresis on 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer and incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C for 12 h. The membrane was washed four times for 5 min with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, followed by incubation with the secondary antibody for an additional 30 min. The membrane was then washed several times and scanned with the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) set to the wavelength 700–800 channel. Surface fluorescence detected by confocal microscopy at the equatorial plane of oocytes expressing GFP-tagged ROMK correlates with channel activity and has been used by us to assess channel expression in the plasma membrane (27Moral Z. Dong K. Wei Y. Sterling H. Deng H. Ali S. Gu R. Huang X.Y. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7156-7163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, GFP fluorescence was excited at 488 nm with an argon laser beam and viewed with an inverted Olympus FV300 confocal system equipped with a 10× lens. We used Scion Image software (Scion Co., Frederick, MD) to determine the fluorescence intensity. All of the images were acquired and processed with identical parameters. Kidneys were perfused with 50 ml of PBS containing heparin (40 unit/ml) followed by 200 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde and were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 h. A Leica 1900 cryostat (Leica) was used to cut kidney slices, which were dried at 42 °C for 1 h. After washing with 1× PBS, the samples were permeablized with 0.4% Triton dissolved in 1× PBS buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% lysine (pH 7.4) for 15 min. The kidney slices were blocked with 2% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with antibodies to POSH and AQP2 for 12 h at 4 °C. The slides were washed with PBS buffer, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The ROMK and POSH constructs were subcloned into pGEX4T-1 to produce the GST fusion proteins for GST pulldown assay. GST, GST-ROMK, and GST-POSH immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 10 μl of POSH or ROMK labeled with [35S]methionine in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), respectively. The beads were then washed five times with NETN buffer. Bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. POSH and ROMK labeled with [35S]methionine were prepared by in vitro translation that was performed using the TnT quick-coupled rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega) with plasmid DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. In addition, no 35S-labeled ROMK1 was also used in some GST pulldown experiments. HEK293T cells were cultured in modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Before the day of transfection, the cells were plated into 35-mm cell culture dishes at 70% confluence. For each transfection experiment, 2 μg of plasmid DNA/dish was mixed with OPTI-MEM@1 culture medium (Invitrogen) containing 6 μl of TransIT-293 (Mirus, Madison, WI). 24 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed with cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% glycerol, 50 mm NaF with protein inhibitor and phosphotase I and II inhibitor mixture from Sigma) and rocked for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatants were stored at −80 °C until use. pRK5-Myc-POSH was the kind gift from Dr. Anrette Seg (Medical Research Council Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology and Cell Biology Unit, University College, London, UK), Full-length POSH was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), peGFPC1-R1 was made as previously described (11Sterling H. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Dong K. Hebert S.C. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4317-4323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All of the mutations were made by overlapping PCR, and the constructs were sequenced for confirmation. Primer sequences are available upon request. To carry out in vitro ubiquitination assay, we used ROMK protein produced from the TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) and His-tagged POSH. Briefly, a T7 promoter-driven vector with a ROMK insertion (1 μg) was mixed with 40 μl of TnT T7 quick master mix, including 1 μm methionine in a total volume of 50 μl and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. The protein was quantitated by Western blot. His-tagged POSH protein was purified from HEK293T cells transfected with the pcDNA6Myc- His-POSH plasmid. The whole cell lysate was mixed with 50 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid magnetic agarose beads in the binding buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20), rocked at room temperature for 1 h, and washed three times with the binding buffer. The His-tagged POSH was eluted with 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20 and stored at −80 °C. The in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed as follows: the 50-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μg of ubiquitin, 1 μg of UBE1, 5 μg of UbcH5a (these three reagents were from BostonBiochem, Cambridge, MA), 5 μl of quick coupled ROMK protein, 500 ng of purified His-POSH protein was incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. The reaction was terminated with 2× sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed with ubiquitin antibody and ROMK antibody. An in vivo ubiquitination assay was carried out in HEK293T cells. The cells were transfected with pEGFPC1-R1 alone or cotransfected with 1 or 2 μg of pcDNA3-POSH. One group of the cells were incubated with 20 μm MG132 for 2 h before being lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. 200 μg of total protein was used for immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot. Within 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with trypsin-containing medium (TrypleTM Ecpresscare) (Invitrogen) for 10 min to detach the cells. The cell suspension (0.2 ml in volume) was carefully removed to a 5 × 5-mm coverglass coated with polylysin followed by additional incubation for 30 min to allow the cells to adhere to the coverglass. The coverglass was transferred to a chamber (1 ml) mounted on the stage of a Nikon inverted microscope. For the perforated whole cell patch clamp experiments, the cells were incubated with a bath solution containing 138 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The experiments were performed at room temperature. Fluorescence signal (an indication of positive transfection) was detected with an intensified video imaging system including SIT 68 camera (Long Island Industries, North Baltimore, NY). Borosilicate glass (1.7-mm OD) was used to make the patch clamp pipette, which was pulled with a Narishege electrode puller. The pipette had a resistance of 2–4 MΩ when filled with 138 mm KCl. The tip of the pipette was filled with pipette solution containing 138 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Then the pipette was back-filled with amphotericin B (2 μg/0.1 ml) containing pipette solution. After forming a high resistance seal (>2 GΩ), the membrane capacitance was monitored until the whole cell patch configuration was formed. The cell membrane capacitance was measured and compensated. The potassium current was measured by an Axon 200A patch clamp amplifier. The current was low pass filtered at 1 KHz and digitized by an Axon interface (Digidata 1200), and data were stored in an IBM-compatible computer and were analyzed using the pClamp software system 7 (Axon). HEK293T cells were transfected with pEGFPC1-ROMK and pcDNA3-POSH. 24 h after transfection the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then incubated with 1 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. This reaction was then quenched by adding quench buffer, and the cells were washed at least two times with TBS buffer, lysed with cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and subjected to pull down with NeutrAvidin Gel (Pierce). POSH, ubiquitin, nonimmune rabbit IgG, and AQP2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA), and ROMK antibody was obtained from Alomone (Jerusalem, Israel). FLAG and GFP antibodies were purchased from Sigma and Clontech (Mountain View, CA), respectively. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. We used the paired Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance to determine the statistical significance. If the p value is less than 0.05, the difference is considered to be significant. We first carried out a double immunofluorescence staining experiment to assess whether POSH is expressed in the renal CCD. We used AQP2 as a marker for the CCD. Fig. 1 is a confocal image demonstrating that POSH is expressed in AQP2-positive CCD tubule segments. Because POSH has been reported to be a scaffold protein (23Alroy I. Tuvia S. Greener T. Gordon D.

Tissue lysates harvested from renal cortex were immunoprecipitated with POSH antibody, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by electrophoresis followed by Western blotting with ROMK antibody. Fig. 2A is a Western blot showing that ROMK protein is immunoprecipitated with POSH. No ROMK coimmunoprecipitated with nonimmune IgG, which was used as a control. We have also performed GST pulldown experiments to examine the interaction between ROMK and POSH (Fig. 2B). GST-POSH fusion protein or GST-ROMK protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with either 10 μl of purified ROMK1 protein or POSH protein labeled with [35S]methionine in NETN buffer. After washing, the bound proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Fig. 2B shows that POSH was able to pull down ROMK1 protein (Fig. 2B, left panel) and that ROMK1 can also pull down POSH (right panel). Moreover, we have used Western blot to examine the interaction between POSH and ROMK1. Fig. 2C is a Western blot showing that GST-POSH pulled down ROMK. We then examined the interaction between POSH and ROMK1 in HEK293T cells transfected with FLAG-tagged ROMK1 and POSH or with POSH alone. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibody, and immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by electrophoresis. Fig. 2D is a Western blot showing that POSH protein is immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody in cells transfected with FLAG-tagged ROMK1 but not in cells transfected with POSH alone, although POSH was expressed under both conditions. Thus, these results indicate that POSH is associated with ROMK channels both in heterologous expression systems as well as in native renal tissue.FIGURE 2ROMK channels are associated with POSH.

Lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with POSH alone, FLAG-tagged ROMK1+POSH, FLAG-tagged ROMK1-N terminus (1–82)+POSH, and FLAG-tagged ROMK1-C terminus (181–392)+POSH were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a FLAG antibody, followed by Western blotting with the antibody directed against POSH. From inspection of Fig. 3, it is apparent that POSH is immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody only in cells transfected with ROMK1 or ROMK1-N terminus but not in cells transfected with ROMK C terminus, suggesting that POSH associates with the N terminus of the ROMK1 protein. We next examined whether POSH regulates ROMK1 channel activity in both HEK293T cells transfected with GFP-ROMK1 and POSH at different concentration (Fig. 4) and Xenopus oocytes injected with different concentrations of POSH cRNA and 5 ng of ROMK1 (Fig. 5). Fig. 4A is a typical whole cell potassium current measured with the perforated whole cell patch recording in HEK293T cells transfected with GFPROMK1+POSH. It is apparent POSH decreased potassium current at a dose-dependent manner. Expression of POSH at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 μg decreased potassium currents at −100 mV cell membrane potential from the control value 1045 ± 20 to 600 ± 16, 500 ± 15, and 370 ± 15 pA (n = 4), respectively (Fig. 4B). The POSH-induced decrease in potassium currents was not due to changes in ROMK1 protein expression because the expression of POSH did not decrease the total ROMK1 protein level (Fig. 4C). We also examined the effect of POSH on ROMK channels in Xenopus oocytes injected with different concentrations of POSH cRNA and 5 ng of ROMK1 (Fig. 5). The results summarized in Fig. 5A demonstrate that POSH inhibited ROMK channel activity in a dose-dependent manner. Coinjection of 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 ng of POSH cRNA decreased potassium current in oocytes injected with 5 ng of ROMK1 cRNA by 12 ± 2, 25 ± 5, 45 ± 5, and 53 ± 7%, respectively. Injection of 10 ng of POSH also decreased the potassium current from 8.7 ± 0.6 to 4.1 ± 0.5 μA (n = 49). Confocal microscope experiments further showed that coinjection of 10 ng of POSH decreased the fluorescence intensity of ROMK localized to the membrane by 49 ± 6% (p < 0.05, n = 20) in oocytes injected with GFP-ROMK1 (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5Effect of POSH on ROMK1 channel activity and expression.

https://openalex.org/W2006579447,"Benzophenone metabolism provides a number of plant natural products with fascinating chemical structures and intriguing pharmacological activities. Formation of the carbon skeleton of benzophenone derivatives from benzoyl-CoA and three molecules of malonyl-CoA is catalyzed by benzophenone synthase (BPS), a member of the superfamily of type III polyketide synthases. A point mutation in the active site cavity (T135L) transformed BPS into a functional phenylpyrone synthase (PPS). The dramatic change in both substrate and product specificities of BPS was rationalized by homology modeling. The mutation may open a new pocket that accommodates the phenyl moiety of the triketide intermediate but limits polyketide elongation to two reactions, resulting in phenylpyrone formation. 3-Hydroxybenzoyl-CoA is the second best starter molecule for BPS but a poor substrate for PPS. The aryl moiety of the triketide intermediate may be trapped in the new pocket by hydrogen bond formation with the backbone, thereby acting as an inhibitor. PPS is a promising biotechnological tool for manipulating benzoate-primed biosynthetic pathways to produce novel compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2018518298,"TMP21 has been shown to be associated with the gamma-secretase complex and can specifically regulate gamma-cleavage without affecting epsilon-mediated proteolysis. To explore the basis of this activity, TMP21 modulation of gamma-secretase activity was investigated independent of epsilon-cleavage using an amyloid-beta precursor proteinepsilon (APPepsilon) construct which lacks the amyloid intracellular domain domain. The APPepsilon construct behaves similarly to the full-length precursor protein with respect to alpha- and beta-cleavages and is able to undergo normal gamma-processing. Co-expression of APPepsilon and TMP21 resulted in the accumulation of membrane-embedded higher molecular weight Abeta-positive fragments, consistent with an inhibition of gamma-secretase cleavage. The APPepsilon system was used to examine the functional domains of TMP21 through the investigation of a series of TMP21-p24a chimera proteins. It was found that chimeras containing the transmembrane domain bound to the gamma-secretase complex and could decrease gamma-secretase proteolytic processing. This was confirmed though investigation of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the TMP21 transmembrane helix. The isolated TMP21 TM peptide but not the homologous p24a domain was able to reduce Abeta production in a dose-dependent fashion. These observations suggest that the TMP21 transmembrane domain promotes its association with the presenilin complex that results in decreased gamma-cleavage activity."
https://openalex.org/W2041232436,"Bacterial luciferase catalyzes the reaction of FMNH(2), O(2), and a long chain aliphatic aldehyde, yielding FMN, carboxylic acid, and blue-green light. The most conserved contiguous region of the primary sequence corresponds to a crystallographically disordered loop adjacent to the active center (Fisher, A. J., Raushel, F. M., Baldwin, T. O., and Rayment, I. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 6581-6586; Fisher, A. J., Thompson, T. B., Thoden, J. B., Baldwin, T. O., and Rayment, I. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 21956-21968). Deletion of the mobile loop does not alter the chemistry of the reaction but decreases the total quantum yield of bioluminescence by 2 orders of magnitude (Sparks, J. M., and Baldwin, T. O. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 15436-15443). In this study, we attempt to localize the loss of activity observed in the loop deletion mutant to individual residues in the mobile loop. Using alanine mutagenesis, the effects of substitution at 15 of the 29 mobile loop residues were examined. Nine of the point mutants had reduced activity in vivo. Two mutations, K283A and K286A, resulted in a loss in quantum yield comparable with that of the loop deletion mutant. The bioluminescence emission spectrum of both mutants was normal, and both yielded the carboxylic acid chemical product at the same efficiency as the wild-type enzyme. Substitution of Lys(283) with alanine resulted in destabilization of intermediate II, whereas mutation of Lys(286) had an increase in exposure of reaction intermediates to a dynamic quencher. Based on a model of the enzyme-reduced flavin complex, the two critical lysine residues are adjacent to the quininoidal edge of the isoalloxazine."
https://openalex.org/W2083158656,"SUMO is a ubiquitin-like protein that is post-translationally attached to one or more lysine residues on target proteins. Despite having only 18% sequence identity with ubiquitin, SUMO contains the conserved ββαββαβ fold present in ubiquitin. However, SUMO differs from ubiquitin in having an extended N-terminus. In S. pombe the N-terminus of SUMO/Pmt3 is significantly longer than those of SUMO in S. cerevisiae, human and Drosophila. Here we investigate the role of this N-terminal region. We have used two dimensional gel electrophoresis to demonstrate that S. pombe SUMO/Pmt3 is phosphorylated, and that this occurs on serine residues at the extreme N-terminus of the protein. Mutation of these residues (in pmt3-1) results in a dramatic reduction in both the levels of high Mr SUMO-containing species and of total SUMO/Pmt3, indicating that phosphorylation of SUMO/Pmt3 is required for its stability. Despite the significant reduction in high Mr SUMO-containing species, pmt3-1 cells do not display an aberrant cell morphology or sensitivity to genotoxins or stress. Additionally, we demonstrate that two lysine residues in the N-terminus of S. pombe SUMO/Pmt3 (K14 and K30) can act as acceptor sites for SUMO chain formation in vitro. Inability to form SUMO chains results in aberrant cell and nuclear morphologies, including stretched and fragmented chromatin. SUMO chain mutants are sensitive to the DNA synthesis inhibitor, hydroxyurea (HU), but not to other genotoxins, such as UV, MMS or CPT. This implies a role for SUMO chains in the response to replication arrest in S. pombe."

The concerted activities of Cdks result in chromatin condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and the up-regulation of genes involved in nucleotide synthesis and DNA replication, among other events. Cdks have long been considered ideal targets for anti-cancer drugs, owing to their importance in the cell cycle. As a result, many Cdk inhibitors have been developed, some of which have progressed to clinical trials. Roscovitine (Selicilib) and flavopiridol (Alvocidib) are examples of Cdk inhibitors that have passed Phase I clinical trials (3Benson C. White J. De Bono J. O'Donnell A. Raynaud F. Cruickshank C.

However, these drugs, as well as most other Cdk inhibitors, are ATP-competitive. The disadvantage of using a therapeutic strategy involving ATP competition is that all kinases possess an ATP-binding site, leading to the potential for reduced target specificity. Recently, advances have been made in identifying Cdk inhibitors that act through novel mechanisms. One example of this effort is the identification of a series of cyclic peptides designed to mimic the structure of the Cdk inhibitor p27. These compounds bind to the substrate recognition site of Cdk complexes and inhibit their kinase activity in vitro (8Andrews M.J. McInnes C. Kontopidis G. Innes L. Cowan A. Plater A. Fischer P.M. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2004; 2: 2735-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Another example is the use of a small, 39-amino acid peptide that inhibits the kinase activity of Cdk2 by mimicking the inhibitory effects of the pRb2/p130 spacer domain (9Bagella L. Sun A. Tonini T.

The use of knockout mice has recently generated much information about the role of Cdks with respect to cell cycle regulation. For instance, mice lacking Cdk2, Cdk4, or Cdk6 are all viable (10Berthet C. Aleem E. Coppola V. Tessarollo L. Kaldis P. Curr.

More recently it has been discovered that mouse embryonic fibroblast cells are able to cycle in the absence of Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6, needing only Cdk1 to complete cell division (14Santamaría D. Barrière C. Cerqueira A. Hunt S. Tardy C. Newton K. Cáceres J.F. Dubus P. Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nature. 2007; 448: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). In light of the fact that Cdks are able to functionally replace one another, highly selective Cdk inhibitors that target only one type of cell cycle Cdk may not be as effective as anti-tumor agents that inhibit Cdk1, Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6. An inhibitor that acts on multiple cell cycle Cdks would therefore have a greater probability of inhibiting tumor cell growth by ensuring that the cell cycle is arrested. Here we report the identification of a novel structural pocket present on Cdk2 that is conserved on Cdks 1, 4, and 6. Using a high throughput in silico screening procedure we have identified compounds that decrease the function of Cdks in cells through binding to this site. The two protein crystal structures used for identification and in silico screening of the structural site were the Cyclin A-Cdk2 and p27kip1-Cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes (RCSB Protein Data Bank codes: 1FIN (15Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar) and 1JSU (16Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Patten A.K. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), respectively). A molecular surface of 1JSU was prepared using the MSROLL program, which was then used as input for the sphere-generating program SPHGEN. A cluster of spheres that was shown to be within the pocket of interest was then selected and edited manually to leave a cluster of 21 spheres. The SHOWBOX program was used to construct a three-dimensional rectangle, 4 Å in every direction from the sphere cluster. The program CHIMERA was used to convert the PDB file of 1JSU into the appropriate mol2 format. The box file that was generated was then used as input for the GRID program, which calculates information concerning the steric and electrostatic environment within the box of the 1JSU mol2 file. DOCK was used to screen the entire NCI/Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) database of small molecules (which consisted of ∼140,000 small molecules at the time of docking) within the 1JSU grid, with the selected spheres as theoretical binding sites. CHIMERA was subsequently used to rank the small molecule output based on predicted energy scores composed of electrostatic interactions and van der Waals' forces. The top 40 compounds were obtained from the NCI/DTP for cell culture testing. All of the programs listed for this procedure were part of the DOCK5.0 suite developed at University of California, San Francisco (17Moustakas D.T. Lang P.T. Pegg S. Pettersen E. Kuntz I.D.

Protein structure visualization and image generation were performed using PyMOL software (DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA). All experiments involving mammalian cell culture were performed using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (35-011-CV, Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA). BT549 and HCT116 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). QBI-293A kidney cells were obtained from Quantum (Montreal, Canada). Chemical reagents and solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Acros (Morris Plains, NJ). Both synthesized compounds displayed spectroscopic data consistent with the proposed structures. NSC43067 (1-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)-3-phenylpropenone): solid NaOH (1.78 g, 44.5 mm) was dissolved in 50 ml of water/ethanol (2:1, v/v) with cooling in an ice bath. Sequential addition of 5-methyl-2-acetyl thiophene (5.00 g, 35.6 mm) and benzaldehyde (3.77 g, 35.6 mm) to the cooled solution of NaOH was followed by rapid stirring on ice for 2 h. The mixture was stored overnight at 4 °C, resulting in the formation of an oily solid. The solid was removed by vacuum filtration, and the filtrate was then concentrated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in hot absolute ethanol and left to cool to provide 4.04 g (50% yield) of NSC43067 as flaky yellow crystals; melting point, 93–95 °C. NSC63002 (2-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-3-pyridin-2-yl-acrylonitrile): The compound was prepared in 26% yield as described in a previous study (18Magarian E.O. Nobles W.L. J. Pharm. Sci. 1969; 58: 1166-1167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) (melting point, 69–70 °C (literature: 69.5–70.5). For [3H]thymidine incorporation assays, cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 30,000 cells per well and allowed to incubate overnight at 37 °C. Following treatment periods, cells were incubated for a further 2 h at 37 °C with 40 μl per well [3H]thymidine (0.1 mCi per ml diluted in PBS, NET027005MC, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were then fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min, followed by a further two washes with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The DNA was then dissolved with 300 μl of 0.2 n sodium hydroxide. For each well, 100 μl was counted in a Beckman Coulter LS6500 multipurpose scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). For cell viability assays, drug activities were determined using a high-throughput CellTiter-Blue assay. Cells (1200–6000; 24-μl volumes) were plated in each well of 384-well plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The next day, the drugs were diluted in media, and 6 μl of these dilutions was added to appropriate wells using an automated pipetting station. Four replicate wells were used for each drug concentration and an additional four control wells received a diluent control without drug. Drug dilutions generally consisted of 1.5-fold dilutions from a maximum final concentration of 100 μm. The cells were incubated with the drug for 72–120 h. At this time, 5 μl of CellTiter-Blue reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well. Cell viability was assessed by the ability of the remaining viable cells to bioreduce resazurin to resorufin. Resazurin is dark blue in color and has little intrinsic fluorescence until it is reduced to resorufin (579 nm Ex/584 nm Em). The change in fluorescence was measured with a Synergy HT microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). The fluorescence data were transferred to a spreadsheet program to calculate the percent viability relative to the four replicate cell wells that did not receive drug. IC50 values were determined using a sigmoidal equilibrium model regression using XLfit version 4.3.2 (ID Business Solutions Ltd.). The IC50 value was defined as the concentration of drug required for a 50% reduction in growth/viability. For flow cytometry analysis, cells were plated at a density of 300,000 cells per plate in P100 dishes. Following treatment, cells were removed from the plate by trypsin digestion and suspended in a solution containing 3.4 mm sodium citrate, 75 μm propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 μg/ml RNase A. Samples were analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACSort flow cytometer. Cells were lysed with extraction buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 10 nm microcystin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate) followed by sonication. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min. The cleared supernatant was then analyzed for total protein concentration with Bradford protein assay dye reagent (500-0006, Bio-Rad), and all extracts were normalized to the lowest protein concentration. The extracts were boiled with one-third volume of 4× SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 24 mm EDTA, 200 mm SDS, 40% glycerol, 300 μm bromphenol blue, 0.4% β-mercaptoethanol) for 5–10 min. Samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.

Cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes (#7524, Cell Signaling) were diluted to a concentration of 12 μg/ml and preincubated with either the vehicle or NCI compounds for 24 h at room temperature. The kinase/treatment mixture was then mixed with the substrate solution for a final concentration of 6 μg/ml Cyclin-Cdk, 25 μg/ml GST-Rb (sc-4112, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 18 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (BLU002A250UC, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.1 μm unlabeled ATP, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Reactions were allowed to incubate for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by quenching with one-third volume 4× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, fixed, and stained with Coomassie dye. Radioactive bands were quantified using a Beckman Coulter LS6500 multipurpose scintillation counter. Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) fused to Cdk4 was stably expressed in 293A cells. GFP cDNA was amplified from the pAcGFP-tubulin plasmid (Clontech) using the following PCR primers: 5′-TTTTGGATCCGATATCCCACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGCCGAG-3′ and 5′-TTTTGGATCCCTTGTACAGCTCATCCATGCC-3′. Following amplification, the GFP PCR product was purified by chloroform/phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The PCR product was subsequently digested with BamHI. The previously described pcDNA3 plasmid encoding Cdk4-His6 contains a BamHI site 5′ to Cdk4-His6 (19Chytil A. Waltner-Law M. West R. Friedman D. Aakre M. Barker D. Law B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47688-47698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This plasmid was also digested with BamHI, followed by treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase for 1 h at 37 °C. Vector and insert DNA were ligated for 18 h at room temperature, creating a construct that contains cDNA encoding GFP in-frame with cDNA encoding Cdk4-His6. The orientation of the insert was confirmed by EcoRV digestion. Ten micrograms of the GFP-Cdk4/pcDNA3 construct was transfected into 293A cells using Lipofectamine (18324-020, Invitrogen). Cells that stably retained the plasmid were first selected by treating the cells with medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 Sulfate (61–234-RG, Cellgro), followed by one round of cell sorting for GFP-positive cells using a FACSAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences) and the Diva program (version 6.1). Clonal lines were then established for experimental analysis. Mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu) stably expressing a Cyclin D1-Cdk2 fusion protein or E2F1 were described previously (19Chytil A.

Cell extracts were prepared as described in the previous section. Samples were centrifuged at either 16,000 × g for 20 min or 150,000 × g for 1 h. In both cases, the supernatants were removed and normalized for protein concentration. The pellets were extracted with 300 μl of extraction buffer containing 1.0% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 10 nm microcystin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 300 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. The extracted pellets were normalized using the same dilution factors as for the supernatant fraction, sonicated vigorously, and boiled for 5–10 min. Cells for immunofluorescence studies were plated onto glass coverslips in 6-well plates. Cells were treated for 24 h with either vehicle control or the indicated NSC compounds. After a further 24-h incubation, the cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, followed by a 10-min incubation with the quench solution (50 mm ammonium chloride plus 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) in the case of Cdk4 visualization. Alternatively, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde followed by incubation with ice-cold 100% methanol for Hsp70 and γ-tubulin visualization. In either case, the coverslips were subsequently incubated with antibody buffer (5% goat serum plus 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) in a humidified chamber for 1 h. Primary antibody staining was performed using an antibody for Cdk4 (sc-601, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Hsp70 (sc-24, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or γ-tubulin (sc-17787, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:100 dilution in antibody buffer, or no primary antibody as a control for nonspecific staining, for 2 h. Following primary antibody incubation, the coverslips were washed four times with PBS and incubated with a goat α-Rabbit Fluor 488 (A11008, Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) or a goat α-Mouse Cy3 secondary antibody (81-6515, Zymed Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, CA) for 1 h at a 1:200 dilution in antibody buffer. Following four additional washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted onto slides with Vectashield plus 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (H-1200, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) to visualize nuclei. Slides were viewed on a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS spectral confocal microscope. Images were collected and processed using Leica Confocal Software (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) Version 2.61, Build 1537. GFP-Cdk4 293A cells were plated, treated, and processed in the same manner as for immunofluorescence. However, instead of antibody incubation, fixed and quenched cells were mounted directly onto slides with Vectashield plus 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. GFP-Cdk4 cells used for time-lapse microscopy were plated at a density of 450,000 cells per plate in fluorodish plates (FD35–100, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Cells were visualized on a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS spectral confocal microscope. We examined the differences between several crystal structures of Cdk2 to identify a novel inhibitor binding site on Cdks. A side-by-side comparison of the structures of the catalytically active Cyclin A-Cdk2 complex and the catalytically inactive p27-Cyclin A-Cdk2 complex revealed the formation of a structural pocket, present only in the inhibited, p27-bound form of Cyclin A-Cdk2 (Fig. 1A). We hypothesized that a small molecule could bind to this pocket and stabilize the Cyclin A-Cdk2 complex in an “open” conformation which would mimic the p27-bound form of Cyclin A-Cdk2, and would thereby inactivate the enzyme catalytically. A sequence alignment of Cdks 1, 2, 4, and 6 revealed that the residues that comprise the pocket are relatively well conserved between these Cdks, indicating that this pocket is likely to be present in the other cell cycle Cdks (Fig. 1B). The pocket is in close proximity to the ATP binding site (two of the residues that make up the pocket are part of the GXGXXG motif). However, the bulk of the pocket is distinct from the ATP-binding region. We performed a high-throughput in silico molecular docking screen on the p27-Cyclin A-Cdk2 crystal structure using the University of California, San Francisco program suite DOCK5.0. Approximately 140,000 small molecules from the NCI/DTP data base were docked into the pocket, designated by the appropriate spheres and scoring grid, and ranked according to their predicted binding energies. The top 40 compounds were ordered from the NCI/DTP and tested in cell culture. Fig. 1C shows a selection of the most active compounds as determined by assays described in later sections, with their predicted energy scores. [3H]Thymidine incorporation assays were performed to examine the influence of the compounds on cell proliferation. Initially, all 40 compounds ordered from the NCI/DTP were tested in cell culture at a concentration of 100 μm to determine if any cytostatic effect could be measured (data not shown). The most promising compounds were subsequently used in more detailed dose-response [3H]thymidine incorporation assays, as well as in further mechanistic studies. The BT549 human breast cancer cell line and the HCT116 human colon cancer cell line exhibited decreased cell proliferation as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation after treatment with compounds NSC43067, NSC43042, and NSC63002 for 24 h (Fig. 2A). Cell cycle analyses of each of these two cell lines were performed by flow cytometry of propidium iodide stained cells after treatment with the same compounds for 24 h. In both cell lines, and for both compounds, an arrest at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle is observed at lower concentrations, but an accumulation of cells in the G2/M cell cycle phase is apparent at higher concentrations (Fig. 2, B and C). Importantly, the profiles from these experiments reveal a lack of a sub-G1 population, indicating that apoptosis is not a significant contributing factor to the observed decrease in cell proliferation. This assay confirms that the decrease in DNA synthesis as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation is associated with cell cycle arrest. IC50 values were also determined for compounds NSC63002 and NSC117024 by Cell Titer-Blue assay in several other breast and lung cancer cell lines (supplemental Fig. S1). Total levels of several Cdks were analyzed by immunoblot to determine whether the compounds affect Cdk abundance. BT549 cells were treated with compounds NSC43067, NSC269621, and NSC63002 at 100 μm and 200 μm for 24 or 48 h. All three compounds significantly reduced the levels of soluble Cdk1, Cdk2, and Cdk4, especially at the highest concentrations and longest time points. The levels of several Cyclins were also affected, but to a lesser extent. This result was not due to a universal effect on all cellular proteins, because the levels of the protein phosphatase PP2A and the structural protein actin did not change appreciably (Fig. 3A). Additionally, no cleaved Caspase 3 bands were observed, indicating that apoptotic cell death did not play a major role in the effects of the NSC compounds on the cells, consistent with the flow cytometry results in Fig. 2. E2F-1 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in mediating Cdk-initiated cell cycle progression. Early cell cycle (G1 to S phase) Cdk activity leads to the phosphorylation of the E2F inhibitor Rb, resulting in its release from E2F family proteins and increased E2F-dependent transcription (for review see Ref. 21Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). Activation of E2F-dependent transcription is thought to be one of the primary cell cycle-related functions of the G1/S Cdks. Therefore, E2F-1 overexpression would be expected to result in the partial reversion of the Cdk-reducing effects of the compounds. To examine this possibility, we used a mink lung epithelial cell line (Mv1Lu) engineered to overexpress E2F-1 (Mv1Lu-E2F1–11) (20Law B.K. Chytil A. Dumont N. Hamilton E.G. Waltner-Law M.E. Aakre M.E. Covington C. Moses H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8184-8198Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Treatment of the parental Mv1Lu cells with 200 μm NSC63002 resulted in an almost complete reduction of phosphorylation of Rb at serine 780, as well as a decrease in the levels of several E2F-1 dependent gene products including Cyclin A, B-Myb, and E2F-1 itself (Fig. 3B). Levels of Cdk1 and Cdk4 were also found to decrease. E2F1 overexpression resulted in a diminished response to compound NSC63002 compared with the effect observed in the parental cells. A decrease in E2F dependent gene products, as well as serine 780 phosphorylation of Rb, was observed, albeit the inhibition was weaker than that observed in the parental cells. The effect of NSC63002 on Rb phosphorylation and E2F-depdendent transcription was also dampened in an Mv1Lu cell line that expresses a constitutively active CyclinD1-Cdk2 fusion protein (19Chytil A. Waltner-Law M. West R. Friedman D. Aakre M. Barker D. Law B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47688-47698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although the levels of the CyclinD1-Cdk2 fusion protein decreased upon drug treatment, Cyclin D1 alone did not. This would indicate that the effects of the compounds are Cdk-dependent. In all of the cell lines, there was no observable change in Erk1/2, and p38, two kinases closely related to the Cdks, or in the loading control, actin. Finally, there was no change in levels of the heat shock proteins Hsc70 or Hsp70, indicating that the compound did not simply induce a general stress response in the cells. In vitro kinase assays were performed using purified CyclinE-Cdk2 complexes to determine whether the compounds directly inhibit Cdk activity. After a 24-h preincubation with the NSC compounds, Cdk-dependent phosphorylation of Rb was dramatically reduced as compared with the vehicle-treated samples (Fig. 3C). Together, these data indicate that the NSC compounds decrease Cdk abundance in cultured cells and directly inhibit Cdk activity in in vitro kinase assays. A decrease in Cdks 1, 2, and 4 was observed as early as 4 h after treatment (Fig. 4A). Time-course experiments were performed to ensure that Cdk down-regulation by the compounds occurred in parallel with cell cycle arrest. BT549 cells treated with 200 μm NSC43042 or NSC63002 were incubated for 4, 8, 12, or 24 h before measuring cell proliferation by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 4B). The cytostatic effects of both compounds were observed as early as 4 h after treatment, in accord with the apparent decrease in Cdk levels. Taken together, these data suggest that the cytostatic effects of the compounds are mediated through a decrease in soluble Cdk levels. Initially, we examined the possibility that the compounds increase protein degradation of the Cdks through proteasomal degradation. Co-treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors, such as lactacystin or 4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitrophenylacetyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal-vinyl sulfone, did not affect compound-induced Cdk ablation, indicating that the effect was not induced by proteasomal degradation of the Cdks (data not shown). Consistent with this result, transfection"
https://openalex.org/W2016887413,"Background X-tox proteins are a family of immune-related proteins only found in Lepidoptera and characterized by imperfectly conserved tandem repeats of several defensin-like motifs. Previous phylogenetic analysis of X-tox genes supported the hypothesis that X-tox have evolved from defensins in a lineage-specific gene evolution restricted to Lepidoptera. In this paper, we performed a protein study in which we asked whether X-tox proteins have conserved the antimicrobial functions of their ancestral defensins and have evolved as defensin reservoirs. Methodology/Principal Findings We followed the outcome of Spod-11-tox, an X-tox protein characterized in Spodoptera frugiperda, in bacteria-challenged larvae using both immunochemistry and antimicrobial assays. Three hours post infection, the Spod-11-tox protein was expressed in 80% of the two main classes of circulating hemocytes (granulocytes and plasmatocytes). Located in secretory granules of hemocytes, Spod-11-tox was never observed in contact with microorganisms entrapped within phagolyzosomes showing that Spod-11-tox is not involved in intracellular pathogen killing. In fact, the Spod-11-tox protein was found to be secreted into the hemolymph of experimentally challenged larvae. In order to determine antimicrobial properties of the Spod-11-tox protein, it was consequently fractionated according to a protocol frequently used for antimicrobial peptide purification. Over the course of purification, the anti-Spod-11-tox immunoreactivity was found to be dissociated from the antimicrobial activity. This indicates that Spod-11-tox is not processed into bioactive defensins in response to a microbial challenge. Conclusions/Significance Altogether, our results show that X-tox proteins have not evolved as defensin reservoirs and have lost the antimicrobial properties of the ancestral insect defensins. The lepidopteran X-tox protein family will provide a valuable and tractable model to improve our knowledge on the molecular evolution of defensins, a class of innate immune effectors largely distributed over the three eukaryotic kingdoms."

Subsequently these transition proteins are replaced by the protamines P1 and P2. Hyperacetylation of histone H4 is linked to their replacement by transition proteins. Here we report that TP2 is acetylated in vivo as detected by anti-acetylated lysine antibody and mass spectrometric analysis. Further, recombinant TP2 is acetylated in vitro by acetyltransferase KAT3B (p300) more efficiently than by KAT2B (PCAF). In vivo p300 was demonstrated to acetylate TP2. p300 acetylates TP2 in its C-terminal domain, which is highly basic in nature and possesses chromatin-condensing properties. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that p300 acetylates four lysine residues in the C-terminal domain of TP2. Acetylation of TP2 by p300 leads to significant reduction in its DNA condensation property as studied by circular dichroism and atomic force microscopy analysis. TP2 also interacts with a putative histone chaperone, NPM3, wherein expression is elevated in haploid spermatids. Interestingly, acetylation of TP2 impedes its interaction with NPM3.

Thus, acetylation of TP2 adds a new dimension to its role in the dynamic reorganization of chromatin during mammalian spermiogenesis. The process of spermiogenesis in mammals, wherein the haploid round spermatids mature into highly condensed spermatozoa, can be divided broadly into three phases. In the first phase, which encompasses stages 1–10, the round spermatids are transcriptionally active and contain nucleosomal chromatin. The second phase (stages 12–15) involves the replacement of nucleosomal histones by transition proteins TP1, TP2, and TP4. These transition proteins, localized exclusively to the nuclei of elongating and condensing spermatids (1Meistrich M.L. Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins.in: Hnilica L.S. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 165-182Google Scholar), constitute about 90% of the chromatin basic proteins, with the level of TP1 being about 2.5 times those of TP2 (2Yu Y.E.

Finally, in the third phase, the transition proteins are replaced by protamines P1 and P2 during stages 16–19 (1Meistrich M.L. Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins.in: Hnilica L.S. Stein G.S.

Biochimie. 1998; 80: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The biological significance of the evolution of transition protein genes and their physiological roles are not yet completely understood. Both TP1−/− and TP2−/− knock-out mice have been generated; they are less fertile than normal mice and show abnormal chromatin condensation (2Yu Y.E. Zhang Y. Unni E. Shirley C.R. Deng J.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 38895-38900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). TP2 is a zinc metalloprotein and contains two atoms of zinc per molecule (9Baskaran R. Rao M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); it condenses DNA with a preference for GC-rich DNA in a zinc-dependent manner (10Kundu T.K. Rao M.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5143-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The domain architecture of TP2 has been delineated and shown to possess two structural and functional domains, the zinc finger modules coordinating the two zinc atoms in TP2 in the N terminus (11Meetei A.R. Ullas K.S. Rao M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38500-38507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and the C-terminal basic domain. Immediately after synthesis, TP2 becomes phosphorylated in the cytosol by the sperm-specific isoform of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (Cs-PKA) (12Meetei A.R. Ullas K.S. Vasupradha V. Rao M.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and modulates the nuclear import of TP2 (13Ullas K.S. Rao M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52673-52680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recently, a nuclear localization signal of TP2 was shown to interact with importin-4, which mediates the transport of TP2 into the spermatid nucleus (14Pradeepa M.M. Manjunatha S. Sathish V. Agrawal S. Rao M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4331-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We had proposed a model depicting the sequence of events leading to TP2 deposition on chromatin and initiation of condensation (12Meetei A.R. Ullas K.S. Vasupradha V. Rao M.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this model we had visualized the phosphorylation of TP2 as temporarily inhibiting the condensation property of TP2, allowing lateral diffusion of TP2 along chromatin to facilitate the recognition of GC-rich CpG island sequences by the two zinc finger modules of TP2. A subsequent dephosphorylation triggers the initiation of chromatin condensation by its basic C-terminal domain.Another major posttranslational modification of histones and non-histone nuclear proteins is acetylation. Reversible acetylation of nuclear proteins plays a pivotal role in various DNA templated functions such as transcription, replication, and recombination repair in eukaryotic cells (15Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar, 16Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). At present, more than 30 proteins have been shown to possess acetyltransferase activity, each of which possesses unique substrate specificity. Many of the chromatin-modifying acetyltransferases were initially found to target histone proteins as substrates but were subsequently shown to target non-histone proteins as well, which includes transcription factors, importins, chaperones, chromatin-associated proteins, and cytoskeleton proteins (reviewed in Ref. 17Spange S. Wagner T. Heinzel T. Krämer O.H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The acetylation/deacetylation cycle is also associated with several cellular processes independent of transcription, such as protein stability, protein-protein interaction, subcellular localization, and regulation of enzyme activity (reviewed in Ref. 17Spange S. Wagner T. Heinzel T. Krämer O.H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar).Histones are known to become hyperacetylated in the elongating spermatids, which are functionally associated with their replacement by transition proteins in mammals (18Christensen M.E. Rattner J.B. Dixon G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 4575-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Histone H4 hyperacetylation coincides with the specific inhibition of deacetylase activity in the elongating spermatids (19Hazzouri M. Pivot-Pajot C. Faure A.K. Usson Y. Pelletier R. Sèle B. Khochbin S. Rousseaux S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 950-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In this context, we were curious to examine whether the transition proteins also undergo acetylation. In this communication, we have been able to detect acetylated TP2 in elongating spermatids. Subsequently, we have found that recombinant TP2 is acetylated in vitro by KAT3B (p300) at four lysine residues in its C terminus. Interestingly, we observed that acetylation of TP2 reduces its DNA condensation ability, modulating its interaction with a putative histone chaperone, NPM3.MATERIALS AND METHODSAll fine chemicals used were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Invitrogen.

Febitha K.K. Kundu T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7534-7545Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).In Vitro Acetylation ReactionIn vitro acetylation assays were performed as described elsewhere (20Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The indicated amounts of proteins (see the legend to Fig. 2) were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in a 30-μl final reaction volume consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 0.5 μl of [3H]acetyl coenzyme A (3.3 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the respective acetyltransferase enzymes. The reaction mixture was then blotted onto P-81 filter paper. After washing with 0.2 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.2, radioactive counts were recorded in a Wallac 1409 liquid scintillation counter. To visualize the radiolabeled acetylated protein, the reaction products were precipitated with 25% trichloroacetic acid, washed with ice-cold acetone, resolved electrophoretically on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and subjected to fluorography using a solution containing 22.5% 2,5-diphenyloxazole in DMSO. Gels were dried, and autoradiography was performed at −80 °C for 2–3 days. Core histones isolated from HeLa cells were used as a positive control, and mouse NAP1 was used as a negative control.Three microgram of in vitro acetylated TP2 (as described earlier) was digested with V8 protease (from Staphylococcus aureus, Sigma) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, at 37 °C for 8 h at an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:50, and the products were separated on 15% acid urea PAGE. The gel was dried, and autoradiography was performed at −80 °C for 2–3 days.Immunoprecipitation-Acetylation Assayp300 was immunoprecipitated using anti-p300 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) from postmeiotic haploid cells (purified by centrifugal elutriation) nuclear extract. Bound proteins were resolved on 6% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-p300 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to detect immunoprecipitated p300 protein. Immuno-pulldown with preimmune serum served as a control. Immunoprecipitated beads were used as enzyme source for acetylation of TP2 and core histones. Acetylation reaction was performed as described above, and the immunoprecipitate using irrelevant monoclonal antibody served as a negative control. Duplicate samples of core histones were run on a 15% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue.Immunoblotting and Localization StudiesTP2 purified from rat testis along with recombinant TP2 and core histones isolated from 0–5% trichloroacetic acid precipitates of the acid extract of sonication resistant nuclei were separated in 12% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with antibody against acetylated lysine (Upstate Biotechnology) and TP2. Nuclear extract was prepared from total testicular cells and sonication-resistant spermatids. The protein was quantified, and equal amounts were resolved in SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with antibody against NPM1 (Invitrogen), NPM3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and PCAF (Sigma). Duplicate samples were run in SDS-PAGE, one for staining with Coomassie blue and the other for Western blotting.For indirect immunofluorescence analysis we followed the decondensation procedure described by us recently (25Ullas K.S. Pradeepa M.M. Nikhil G. Rammohan N. Rao M.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2009; 57: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) to avoid problems associated with antigen accessibility in the condensed nuclei. Briefly, total testicular cells obtained from 60-day-old rat were swollen by resuspending them in decondensation buffer containing 0.05 mg/ml heparin (Sigma) and 10 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma) in phosphate buffered-saline (PBS) and incubated in ice for 40 min. Cells obtained after two washes in 1× PBS were processed for indirect immunofluorescence analysis. Mock decondensed cells (incubated in PBS without dithiothreitol and heparin) served as control. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 20 min followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS was used for blocking nonspecific sites. Localization experiments were carried out by sequentially incubating the smears with primary antibody against TP2 (rabbit polyclonal), acetylated lysine (mouse monoclonal), PCAF (rabbit polyclonal), p300 (rabbit polyclonal), NPM1 (mouse monoclonal), and NPM3 (goat polyclonal); counterstained with corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 568 Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma). Images were acquired by using a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 META; Carl Zeiss).MALDI-TOF Analysis of TP2Endogenous TP2 purified from rat testis was dissolved in 10 μl of deionized water and desalted using a Millipore C4 ZipTip (Millipore, Billerica, MA) with 5 μl of an elution solvent of 50:50 acetonitrile:0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. A 0.3-μl aliquot was placed on the MALDI target, and a 0.5-μl aliquot of a 0.02 μg/μl solution of Promega sequence-grade trypsin in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added. The sample was subjected to on-target tryptic digestion for 1 min, after which 0.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (saturated solution in 50:50 acetonitrile:water) was added to the spot, which stopped the enzymatic reaction. Peptide mass spectra were acquired on a Bruker Ultraflex I MALDI-TOF/TOF at the UNC-Duke Proteomics Center (University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill). Data were acquired in the reflectron mode over a scan range of m/z 800–4000. A peptide mass fingerprinting data-base search was performed using the Mascot data-base search engine, allowing six missed cleavages (because of the short digestion time) and with acetylation as a variable modification. Peptide masses were found that matched the following acetylated peptides, but the ions were of too low abundance to be confirmed by tandem mass spectroscopy. To identify the number of residues modified by p300, in vitro mass acetylated protein was separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE, the band was excised out, and in-gel protease digestion was carried out in ammonium bicarbonate buffer as described elsewhere (26Steen H. Pandey A. Anderson J.S. Mann M. Sci. STKE. 2002; 2002: PL16PubMed Google Scholar). V8 protease (Sigma) or trypsin (Sigma) was used for digestion; the resultant peptides were extracted in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the peptide masses were analyzed by MALDI-TOF (Bruker Daltonics).Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy of Protein-DNA ComplexesSynthetic poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC) (Sigma) was dissolved in Tris-EDTA and dialyzed against CD buffer overnight before use. Circular dichroism spectra of poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC) and its complex with TP2 protein were recorded at room temperature in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, and 10 μm ZnSO4. The complexes were formed by the addition of buffer, DNA, and finally the protein. The complexes, with increasing protein concentrations, were incubated for 10 min (an increase in the incubation time beyond 10 min did not change the spectra) for each addition of the protein, and the spectra were recorded in a JASCO-810 spectropolarimeter from 300 to 250 nm. The final concentration of the nucleic acids was calculated using the molar extinction coefficients (per mol of phosphate at 260 nm and at 25 °C) and expressed as molar concentration of bases for poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC) = 6350. A mean residue weight of 330 was used for calculating the molar ellipticity of nucleic acids. The change in molar ellipticity observed at 270 nm was plotted as a function of the protein:DNA ratio (mol of protein/base pair). All the nucleoprotein complexes were monitored routinely for absorbance at 400 nm for any light scattering due to aggregation of the complexes; the absorbance was in the range of 0.002 to 0.004.Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Analysis of Nucleoprotein ComplexesAtomic force microscopy was used to visualize TP2-DNA complexes using a 7.2-kb plasmid, p208-12, containing 12 repeats of sea urchin 5s rDNA (27Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. Van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. J. C. Hansen) linearized by digestion with HindIII. All of the samples were dialyzed against buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm MgCl2. DNA was spotted on mica and immediately acetylated or mock-acetylated TP2 was added and incubated for 2 min. After washing with deionized water, mica was dried using N2 gas and processed for imaging using a Nanoscope IV (Digital Instruments) and an RTSP cantilever in air under the tapping mode. The scanning frequency was 1 Hz, and images were captured with the height mode in a 512 × 512-pixel format. The images were processed (plane-fitted and flattened) by the program accompanying the imaging module.Protein Interaction StudiesTo elucidate whether NPM3 and/or NPM1 interacts with TP2, an in vitro interaction study was performed as described previously (14Pradeepa M.M. Manjunatha S. Sathish V. Agrawal S. Rao M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4331-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, protein-A agarose coupled with anti-TP2 antibodies or preimmune serum were incubated with bacterially expressed TP2 and GST-tagged rat NPM3 or His6-tagged human NPM1 in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture) for 3–4 h. After washing with buffer C three times, proteins were eluted with SDS sample loading buffer. Proteins were separated in 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-GST antibody to detect GST-NPM3 and anti-His tag antibody to detect His-NPM1.To study whether TP2 interacts with NPM3, an in vivo immunoprecipitation experiment was performed as follows. Ten microliters of protein A-agarose (Invitrogen) was incubated with 20 μg of either irrelevant antibody or NPM3 monoclonal antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) for 1 h followed by washing once with PBS. Total testicular cell nuclei from a 70-day-old rat was prepared by mincing the testis in PBS followed by homogenization with buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). After separating the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, the nuclear fractions were lysed in buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% v/v glycerol, 420 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture). Salt concentration was adjusted to 150 mm by diluting the mixture in buffer C. Nuclear lysate was precleared with protein A-agarose beads followed by incubation with antibody coupled beads for 3–4 h and then by three washes with buffer C. The bound proteins were separated on SDS-12% PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-TP2 antibody to detect immunoprecipitated TP2.To identify the TP2 domain interacting with NPM3, a peptide pulldown assay was performed as follows. five μg each of the chemically synthesized biotin-conjugated TP2 peptides were allowed to bind to immobilized avidin beads (Pierce) in PBS for 1 h. Beads bound to biotinylated peptides were incubated with 2 μg of GST-NPM3 in buffer C for 3–4 h at 4 °C, followed by three washes with the same buffer. The bound proteins were separated on SDS-12% PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-GST antibody to detect precipitated GST-NPM3.GST pulldown assays were performed to study the effect of acetylation on TP2 with NPM3 interaction. GST-NPM3 and GST proteins were immobilized to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4 °C. Glutathione-agarose 4B beads coupled with GST and GST-NPM3 were incubated with acetylated or mock-acetylated recombinant TP2 in buffer C and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h followed by three washes with the same buffer. Bound fractions were separated on SDS-12% PAGE, and TP2 was detected by Western blot analysis with anti-TP2 monospecific antibody.Real-time PCR AnalysisReal-time PCR analysis was performed as described previously (14Pradeepa M.M. Manjunatha S. Sathish V. Agrawal S. Rao M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4331-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The primers used were as follows: NPM1 (GenBankTM accession number NM_012992) forward primer, 5′-ccacctgtggtcttgaggtt-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-tcttgaccctttgaccttgg-3′; NPM3 (GenBankTM accession number XM_001058548) forward primer, 5′-gaacatgtgctggctttgaa-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-gcaggaaggattccacacag-3′. Differences in Ct (threshold values) were used to calculate -fold difference in expression of mRNA in gametic diploid (2n) Tetraploid (4n) and haploid (n) cells by the Delta-Delta Ct method (2delta-delta Ct) of analysis. NACA (nascent polypeptide-associated complex α) was used as an internal normalization control, as its expression level across different stages of germ cell differentiation was found to be unaltered in our microarray experiments.RESULTSAs mentioned earlier, acetylation/deacetylation of histones plays a major role in many of the chromatin-mediated functions including the histone replacement process in mammalian spermiogenesis (18Christensen M.E. Rattner J.B. Dixon G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 4575-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Hazzouri M. Pivot-Pajot C. Faure A.K. Usson Y. Pelletier R. Sèle B. Khochbin S. Rousseaux S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 950-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Although genetic studies have clearly shown that the two transition proteins TP1 and TP2 are essential for the generation of viable spermatozoa, the molecular mechanism involved in the deposition of these transition proteins on spermatid chromatin, histone displacement, and their subsequent replacement by protamines are rather poorly understood. We were curious to examine whether transition protein 2 also gets acetylated during spermiogenesis.For this purpose, we carried out analysis with acetylated lysine antibody to detect the presence of acetylated TP2 in rat spermatids. 5–25% trichloroacetic acid precipitate fractions of the acid extract of the sonication-resistant nuclei (representing elongating and elongated spermatids) were probed with anti-acetylated lysine antibody (Fig. 1A). Anti-acetylated lysine antibody picked up only in vivo TP2 (Fig. 1A, lane 3) band but not TP1 (bottom band in lane 3) and bacterially expressed TP2 (lane 2), indicating the presence of in vivo acetylated TP2. An intense signal in the 5% trichloroacetic acid precipitate of sonication-resistant spermatid acid extract (Fig. 1A, lane 1) shows the presence of hyperacetylated H4 in the elongating spermatids as reported earlier (19Hazzouri M.

https://openalex.org/W1986853228,"Cyclin D1 is over-expressed in various human tumors and therefore can be a potential oncogenic target antigen. However, only a limited number of T cell epitopes has been characterized. We aimed at identifying human cyclin D1-derived peptides that include both CD4 and CD8 T cell epitopes and to test if such multi-epitope peptides could yield improved cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses as well as cytotoxic CD4 T cells. Five HLA-DR.B1-binding peptides containing multiple overlapping CD4 epitopes and HLA-A0201-restricted CD8 T cell epitopes were predicted by computer algorithms. Immunogenicity of the synthetic peptides was assessed by stimulating T cells from healthy donors in vitro and the epitope recognition was measured by IFN-γ ELISPOT and 51Chromium release assays. A HLA-DR.B1 peptide, designed “DR-1”, in which a HLA-A0201-binding epitopes (D1-1) was imbedded, induced CD3 T cell responses against both DR-1 and D1-1 peptides in IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. This suggested processing of the shorter D1-1 epitope from the DR-1 sequence. However, only DR-1-stimulated CD4 or CD3 T cells possessed cytotoxicity against peptide-pulsed autologous DCs and a cancer cell line, that expresses a high level of cyclin D1. Monoclonal antibody to HLA-DR abrogated the epitope-specific responses of both CD3 and CD4 T cells, demonstrating class II-mediated killing. Our studies suggest a possible role of CD4 T cells in anti-tumor immunity as cytotoxic effectors against HLA-DR expressing cancers and provide a rationale for designing peptide vaccines that include CD4 epitopes."

https://openalex.org/W2125840362,"The binding of transcription factors to their respective DNA sites is a key component of every regulatory network. Predictions of transcription factor binding sites are usually based on models for transcription factor specificity. These models, in turn, are often based on examples of known binding sites.Collections of binding sites are obtained in simulation experiments where the true model for the transcription factor is known and various sampling procedures are employed. We compare the accuracies of three different and commonly used methods for predicting the specificity of the transcription factor based on example binding sites. Different methods for constructing the models can lead to significant differences in the accuracy of the predictions and we show that commonly used methods can be positively misleading, even at large sample sizes and using noise-free data. Methods that minimize the number of predicted binding sequences are often significantly more accurate than the other methods tested.Different methods for generating motifs from example binding sites can have significantly different numbers of false positive and false negative predictions. For many different sampling procedures models based on quadratic programming are the most accurate."
https://openalex.org/W2034390232,"Growth-blocking peptide (GBP) is a hormone-like peptide that suppresses the growth of the host armyworm. Although the 23-amino acid GBP (1–23 GBP) is expressed in nonparasitized armyworm plasma, the parasitization by wasp produces the 28-amino acid GBP (1–28 GBP) through an elongation of the C-terminal amino acid sequence. In this study, we characterized the GBP variants, which consist of various lengths of the C-terminal region, by comparing their biological activities and three-dimensional structures. The results of an injection study indicate that 1–28 GBP most strongly suppresses larval growth. NMR analysis shows that these peptides have basically the same tertiary structures and that the extension of the C-terminal region is disordered. However, the C-terminal region of 1–28 GBP undergoes a conformational transition from a random coiled state to an α-helical state in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine micelles. This suggests that binding of the C-terminal region would affect larval growth activity. Growth-blocking peptide (GBP) is a hormone-like peptide that suppresses the growth of the host armyworm.

Injection of GBP into nonparasitized armyworm larvae early in the last instar delays larval growth and retards pupation for more than a few days. Our previous studies showed that GBP is a hormone-like biogenic peptide of the host armyworm (5Ohnishi A. Hayakawa Y. Matsuda Y. Kwon K.W. Takahashi T.A. Sekiguchi S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Yamanaka A. Izumi S. Tomino S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 76: 185-189Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In nonparasitized larvae, the concentrations of GBP were much higher in the early larval stages than in the latter ones. However, parasitization by wasp induces an elevation of GBP in the last larval stages. This elevation was shown to lead to growth retardation via repression of juvenile hormone esterase activity (7Noguchi H. Hayakawa Y. Downer R.G.H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 197-201Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Noguchi H. Hayakawa Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 659-665Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Hayakawa Y. Noguchi H. Eur. J.

Interestingly, a cDNA analysis indicated that the cDNA encodes a 23-amino acid GBP (1–23 GBP), although GBP purified from parasitized armyworm plasma consists of 25 amino acid residues. GBP was expressed as a 23-residue peptide (1–23 GBP) in nonparasitized armyworm larvae, whereas 1–25 GBP, containing Tyr24 and Gln25, was purified from the parasitized larvae. Moreover, the preliminary peptide sequencing of GBP prepared from parasitized larval hemolymph showed the 26th and 27th residues on rare occasions (Leu and Ile, respectively) (6Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Yamanaka A. Izumi S. Tomino S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 76: 185-189Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, we concluded that the TAG stop codon for the 24th amino acid was unusually decoded as Tyr upon parasitization by parasitoid wasps (10Endo Y. Ohnishi A. Hayakawa Y. J. Insect Physiol. 1998; 44: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and predicted that an intact and mature GBP synthesized in the parasitized armyworm larvae would consist of 28 amino acid residues (1–28 GBP). growth-blocking peptide GBP-binding protein dodecylphosphocholine doxylstearic acid reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography nuclear Overhauser effect heteronuclear single quantum coherence root mean square deviation matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry hydrogen-deuterium.

More than 10 GBP homologous peptides have been identified in Lepidopteran insects, and based on their N-terminal consensus sequences (Glu1-Asn2-Phe3), they have been categorized as the ENF peptide family (14Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of 1–25 GBP consists of a disordered N-terminal region (residues Glu1–Gly6), a well ordered core region (residues Cys7–Thr22) stabilized by a disulfide bond and a short antiparallel β-sheet, and a short unstructured C-terminal region (Phe23–Glu25) (15Aizawa T.

Because no GBP receptor or its gene has been isolated yet, the nature of either of them at the cellular and molecular levels is poorly understood at present. In contrast, the relationship between the structure and activity of GBP has been well studied by analyzing the biological activities of several variants of GBP and plasmatocyte-spreading peptide (one of the ENF family peptides). Especially, extensive studies on the N termini (residues 1–6) of GBP and plasmatocyte-spreading peptide demonstrated the importance of Phe3 for exerting their hemocyte stimulating activity, thereby suggesting a possible mechanism for receptor activation that requires binding of the aromatic ring of Phe3 and a closely spaced primary amine with receptor activating properties (16Clark K.D.

In contrast, the C termini of GBP and other ENF peptides have received less attention, because of the weak secondary structure predictions. Therefore, in this study we focused on the C terminus region of GBP and analyzed its contribution to the expression of some biological activities and to the tertiary structure of this peptide. Especially, we prepared GBP with 28 amino acids and characterized the C-terminal region of 1–28 GBP (residues Phe23–Thr28), because we knew that GBP is present as a 23-amino acid peptide in nonparasitized healthy larvae and that GBP with 28 amino acids has been found only in parasitized host larvae. Our results suggest that the elongation of the C-terminal region of Phe23–Thr28 greatly reinforced GBP binding with the membrane. Further, the elongation increased GBP inhibition of larval growth. P. separata was reared on an artificial diet at 25 ± 1 °C with a photoperiod of 16 h of light and 8 h of dark (1Hayakawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10813-10816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The penultimate instar larvae undergoing ecdysis between 2 and 2.5 h after lights on were designated as day 0 last instar larvae (1Hayakawa Y. J. Biol.

GBPs (Table 1) were expressed and purified using our previous procedure (20Sekiya T. Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Koso. 1990; 35: 2977-2991PubMed Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding the entire GBP sequence was used as a template, and polymerase chain reactions were performed with each GBP primer. GBPs were expressed as thioredoxin fusion proteins and purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). 15N labeling was achieved by growing the bacteria in minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. The purified proteins were cleaved by enterokinase enzyme (Invitrogen) and further purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The peptides after HPLC purification were judged to be homogeneous after a second analysis by RP-HPLC, which found that the purity of each analogue was above 95%. The purified peptides were further confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).TABLE 1Sequences of 1–23, 1–25, and 1–28 GBP1–23 GBPENFSG GCVAG YMRTP DGRCK PTF1–25 GBPENFSG GCVAG YMRTP DGRCK PTFYQ1–28 GBPENFSG GCVAG YMRTP DGRCK PTFYQ LIT Open table in a new tab GBPs were dissolved at a concentration of 0.4 mm in 60 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.6. These solutions were incubated in 100 μl of the plasma isolated from insect hemolymph at 25 °C. After incubation, the peptide samples were submitted to RP-HPLC analysis on a 5C18-AR-300 column (Nacalai Tesque; 250 × 10 mm) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (99.9/0.1 v/v). Fractions corresponding to each peak were collected and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The experimental injection method was a modification of the previously published method of Hayakawa and Ohnishi (11Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Day 0 last instar larvae (0.17–0.18 g) of armyworm were injected with the indicated amounts of GBPs early in the last larval instar and weighed at 24 h after injection. To elucidate the structure, each GBP was dissolved in 250 μl of 90% H2O, 10% D2O to give a final concentration of 3 mm (pH 4.4 and 6.8). NMR samples of 1–28 GBP bound to DPC micelles were prepared under the same conditions containing 200 mm d38-DPC. The NMR experiments were carried out on either a JEOL ECA 600 MHz or a Bruker DRX 500 MHz spectrometer. All of the NMR spectra were recorded at 10, 20, or 30 °C. The chemical shifts were measured from the internal standard of sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (The chemical shifts have been submitted to the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB) under accession numbers 11068, 11069, and 11070.). At various peptide concentrations (0.1–3 mm) and pH levels (pH 4.4 and 6.8), there were no meaningful changes in chemical shifts or peak line widths of 1H one-dimensional NMR spectra. Double quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy spectra (21Rance M. Sørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3108) Google Scholar), and NOE spectroscopy spectra (23Macura S. Huang Y. Suter D. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 43: 259-281Google Scholar) with mixing times of 100–300 ms were recorded during suppression of the water signal by a water gate pulse (24Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenár V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3526) Google Scholar). The NMR spectra of the 15N-labeled sample of 1–28 GBP were recorded under the same conditions as nonlabeled samples except for the peptide concentration of 1 mm using 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) (25Palmer 3rd, A.G. Cavanagh J. Wright P.E. Rance M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 151-170Google Scholar), 15N-edited HSQC-total correlation spectroscopy (26Kay L.E. Marion D. Bax A. J. Magn.

The data for the 1–28 GBP bound to DPC micelles were recorded under the same conditions containing 100 mm d38-DPC. The data were processed using NMRpipe 4.1 and NMRDraw 2.3 (27Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J Biomol NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11562) Google Scholar) and analyzed using Sparky 3.111 software (28Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY. University of California, San Francisco2001Google Scholar). The average chemical shift differences in the amide proton and nitrogen resonances between 1–28 GBP in water and those in DPC micelles were calculated using the following equation (29Farmer 2nd, B.T. Constantine K.L. Goldfarb V. Friedrichs M.S. Wittekind M. Yanchunas Jr., J. Robertson J.G. Mueller L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 995-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), Δδavg=(ΔδH)2+(ΔδN/5.88)2(Eq. 1) where ΔδH and ΔδN are the chemical shift differences of the amide proton and nitrogen resonances between 1–28 GBP in water and those in DPC micelles. 15N-{1H} NOE values were measured for each of the 15N amides using standard pulse sequences with a gradient at 500 MHz. 15N-Labeled 1–28 GBP was dissolved in 250 μl of 90% H2O, 10% D2O (in the absence or presence of 100 mm d38-DPC) to give a final concentration of 1 mm (pH 4.4). 15N-{1H} NOE values are reported as peak intensity ratios obtained with and without 1H saturation. The three-dimensional structures were calculated in the program ARIA 1.2 (30Linge J.P. Habeck M. Rieping W. Nilges M. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 315-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) implemented in CNS 1.1 (31Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16966) Google Scholar). Angle restraints were derived from an analysis of the 3JNHα coupling constant, and the minimum range employed for ϕ torsion angle restraints was ±30°. The hydrogen bonding pattern was included as a constraint for secondary structure elements, where the proximity and orientation between amide protons and carbonyl groups could be determined. The 20 refined structures with the lowest energy contributions from intramolecular interactions were chosen to represent the NMR ensemble. These final ensembles of accepted structures satisfy the following criteria: no NOE violations greater than 0.5 Å and no RMSD for angle deviations from the ideal greater than 5°. The quality of the final structures was assessed using the program PROCHECK-NMR (32Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4427) Google Scholar). The conformers, including calculation of root mean square deviation values, were analyzed by the MOLMOL program (33Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar). GBPs were mixed with dodecylphosphocholine micelles to a final concentration of 150 μm GBP and 50 mm DPC micelles in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). Samples (400 μl) were incubated at room temperature for 30–60 min, then layered on filters (10,000 molecular weight cut-off), and spun at 2000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 30 min. The concentrations of filtrated GBPs were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and compared with those of GBPs not exposed to DPC micelles. Small unilamellar vesicles of 1 mm dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine were prepared in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) by sonication. Biosensor experiments were carried out with a BIACORE X analytical system (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using an L1 sensor chip. The running buffer used for all of the experiments was 20 mm phosphate buffer. The surface was washed by injecting 25 μl of 40 mm N-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Small unilamellar vesicles (80 μl) were immediately applied to the sensor chip surface at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The multilamellar structures were removed from the lipid surface by injecting 30 μl of 10 mm sodium hydroxide at a flow rate of 50 μl/min, in a stable base line. The negative control bovine serum albumin (10 μl, 0.1 mg/ml in 20 mm phosphate buffer) was injected to confirm the complete coverage of the chip surface with lipid by the absence of nonspecific binding. Peptide solutions (25 μl, 150 μm in 20 mm phosphate buffer) were injected for 300 s at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Upon completion of injection, buffer flow was continued for 600 s to allow for dissociation. The operating temperature was 25 °C. To measure the H/D exchange of the amide protons, an ∼1 mm 15N-labeled 1–28 GBP sample was dissolved in 100% D2O in the presence of 100 mm d38-DPC, and 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded at different time intervals. HSQC peaks were monitored for disappearance at 15, 25, 35, and 45 min upon the addition of the solvent. The DPC-bound and water-accessible residues of 1–28 GBP in DPC micelles were identified by measuring the effect of 5-doxyl stearic acid (5-DSA) on the intensities of peaks in 1H one-dimensional spectra or 1H-15N HSQC spectra. In 100 μl of 30% DPC solution, 1.5 mg of 5-DSA was solubilized. The 5-DSA solution was titrated to 1 mm unlabeled (in 100% D2O) or 15N-labeled 1–28 GBP (in 90% H2O/10% D2O) in the presence of 100 mm d38-DPC. The one-dimensional spectra and HSQC spectra were collected for each point, and the intensities were compared. The intensity reductions of HSQC spectra caused by close proximity to the spin label were calculated as the ratios of peak intensities in spectra from the sample containing the respective spin labels to the peak intensities derived from the same sample before adding the probes. The 5-DSA did not alter the protein structure, as evidenced by the absence of chemical shift perturbations. GBP has been purified for the first time from the hemolymph of the host armyworm. Follow-up studies demonstrated that GBP is synthesized as a propeptide precursor that is processed by processing enzyme(s) in hemolymph. After processing, the matured GBP must be exposed to various endogenous proteases in vivo. We expected to find differences in the half-lives of the GBPs (1–23 GBP, 1–25 GBP, and 1–28 GBP). The difference in the degradation kinetics of GBP in insect hemolymph may be involved with their growth inhibitory activities. For this reason, we analyzed their half-lives by RP-HPLC of the peptides after incubating them with plasma fractions prepared from the armyworm larvae. Fig. 1 shows chromatograms after incubation of recombinant GBP peptides with the plasma preparation without blood cells in vitro. The retention times of 1–23 GBP, 1–25 GBP, and 1–28 GBP were 34, 33, and 45 min, respectively. The chromatograms of 1–23 GBP and 1–25 GBP show that these peptides are hardly degraded in plasma for 24 h. In contrast, 1–28 GBP was degraded immediately. The degradation products were observed at the retention times of 35 and 40 min. The fractions corresponding to each peak were 1–25 GBP and 1–26 GBP by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. These results indicate that the elongated C-terminal regions were highly susceptible to degradation in insect plasma. Our previous studies suggested that the 24th stop codon would be decoded as Tyr unconventionally by polydnavirus infection in the same manner as tobacco mosaic virus infection (34Beier H. Barciszewska M. Krupp G. Mitnacht R. Gross H.J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 351-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Beier H. Barciszewska M. Sickinger H.D. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the mature GBP in armyworm plasma would consist of 28 amino acids in the parasitized larvae (6Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Yamanaka A. Izumi S. Tomino S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 76: 185-189Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, GBP purified from the plasma of the parasitized larvae was dominantly 1–25 GBP. Judging from the results of the present study, 1–25 GBP in parasitoid armyworm plasma would be the degradation product of 1–28 GBP. The Leu26-Ile27-Thr28 residues of 1–28 GBP are expected to be immediately degraded to 1–25 GBP by a protease in the hemolymph of the larvae. To reveal the effect of the elongated C-terminal region on the biological activities of GBP, we compared three peptide variants in terms of larval growth retardation. In the previous study, the injection of 1–25 GBP into the armyworm P. separata larvae dose-dependently reduced larval growth rates (1Hayakawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10813-10816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hayakawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7982-7984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the weights of GBP-injected larvae with those of control larvae injected with bovine serum albumin. Larval growth was clearly inhibited by 40 or 400 pmol of 1–25 GBP, whereas larvae injected with 4 pmol exhibited no reduction in weight gain relative to control larvae (Fig. 2). On the other hand, larvae injected with 40 or 400 pmol of 1–23 GBP also gained less weight than control larvae but gained more weight than larvae injected with 1–25 GBP. Interestingly, larvae injected with 1–28 GBP even at 4 pmol gained significantly less weight than control larvae. The injection with 40 or 400 pmol of 1–28 GBP completely inhibited larval growth for at least 24 h after injection. Therefore, 1–28 GBP exhibited growth blocking activity 100-fold greater than 1–23 GBP, although the C-terminal region of 1–28 GBP was readily degraded in insect plasma. The NMR structure of 1–25 GBP in aqueous solution was previously reported (15Aizawa T. Fujitani N. Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Ohkubo T. Kumaki Y. Kawano K. Hikichi K. Nitta K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1887-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The core structure of 1–25 GBP consists of a short segment of double stranded β-sheet in the region of Tyr11–Arg13 and Cys19–Pro21, a type II β-turn in the region of Val8–Tyr11, and a type I β-turn in the region of Thr14–Gly17. To investigate the structural features of the C-terminal region, we assigned the chemical shifts of 1–23 GBP and 1–28 GBP. The NMR signals of the backbone protons for 1–23 GBP and 1–28 GBP were completely assigned. A structural calculation based on NOE data, reported in Table 2, was performed. Superpositions of the backbones of the 20 lowest energy structures of GBPs are shown in Fig. 3. The secondary structures of 1–23 GBP and 1–28 GBP each consist of an antiparallel β-sheet in the regions of Tyr11–Arg13 and Cys19–Pro21. Although there are differences in the lengths of the C termini of the GBPs, the core structures of these three peptides are extremely similar. The C-terminal region of GBP seems to have an insignificant effect on the structure in the core region because the elongated C-terminal region of 1–28 GBP is unstructured in water. Moreover, this structural information suggested that the C-terminal region of 1–28 GBP will be easily degraded by the various proteases in armyworm plasma.TABLE 2Structural statistics for the final 20 structures of GBP without micelles1–23 GBP1–28 GBPNumber of experimental restraintsTotal unambiguous NOEs326543Intraresidue139214Sequential90159Medium range3165Long range66105Total hydrogen bond restraints1814Dihedral angle restraintsϕ1520Average pairwise RMSD (Å)All backbone atoms (residues 7–22) (Å)0.53 ± 0.160.55 ± 0.19All heavy atoms (residues 7–22) (Å)1.08 ± 0.241.36 ± 0.28RMSD from experimental dataDistances (Å)0.015 ± 0.0030.017 ± 0.003Dihedral angles (°)0.770 ± 0.2120.367 ± 0.177Most favored regions (%)81.773.8Additional allowed regions (%)17.725.5Generously allowed regions (%)0.70.8Disallowed regions (%)0.00.0 Open table in a new tab Despite the rapid degradation of the elongated C terminus in insect plasma, 1–28 GBP strongly inhibited the armyworm larval growth. What part does the C-terminal region of 1–28 GBP play in the growth inhibitory activity? Gololobov et al. (36Gololobov G. Noda Y. Sherman S. Rubinstein I. Baranowska-Kortylewicz J. Paul S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 753-758PubMed Google Scholar) studied a membrane-binding peptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and proposed that the interactions of peptides with membrane components protect the peptides from degradation in vivo. This result leads us to hypothesize that the elongation of the C terminus of the 1–28 GBP interacts with insect membrane components and is protected from degradation. To verify this hypothesis, we tested the GBPs for the ability to interact with dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles. DPC is a well characterized model membrane system used frequently in solution NMR studies of peptide-membrane interactions (37Lerch M. Mayrhofer M. Zerbe O. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 1153-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). DPC has a neutral head group and mimics the anisotropic environment of a lipid membrane. DPC forms a stable micelle with a molecular mass of ∼20 kDa, resulting in reasonable correlation time and manageable line width for studies utilizing solution NMR. However, compared with a planar membrane, a micelle exhibits a rather different, highly curved surface. Fig. 4 (A and B) shows the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 1–28 GBP in the absence or presence of DPC micelles at 20 °C. Broader cross-peaks were observed in the C-terminal region in DPC micelles. The chemical shift differences of the backbone amide proton and nitrogen resonances between aqueous solution and DPC micelles were calculated (Fig. 4C). Although the chemical shift differences of the N-terminal and core residues hardly changed, the C-terminal residues represented large chemical shift perturbations. To confirm the interaction between GBPs and DPC micelles, we performed microfiltration assays (38Haarer B.K. Petzold A.S. Brown S.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7864-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The relative ratios of the filtrate concentrations of GBP variants in the absence and presence of DPC micelles are shown in Fig. 5A. In this experiment, free GBPs (<3,000 Da) passed through an ultra-filtration membrane (10,000 molecular weight cut-off), whereas GBPs bound to DPC micelles (>20,000 Da) could not pass. The filtrate concentrations of 1–23 GBP are almost the same in the absence of DPC micelles as in their presence. In contrast, the concentration of filtrated 1–28 GBP was significantly decreased in the presence of DPC micelles. This shows the strong binding between DPC micelles and 1–28 GBP. Similarly, the filtrate concentration of 1–25 GBP was reduced in the presence of DPC micelles. 1–25 GBP exhibits a lower affinity for DPC micelles than 1–28 GBP. These results suggest that the binding affinities of GBPs for membrane were enhanced according to the length of the C terminus. We utilized surface plasmon resonance experiments to confirm the binding of GBP variants to gain a better understanding of the membrane system. Fig. 5B shows the comparative sensorgram obtained for each peptide with immobilized lipids. The sensorgram for 1–28 GBP showed markedly higher response levels than that for 1–23 or 1–25 GBP. As reported by other groups, sensorgram of peptides bound to the lipid surface generally show complex biphasic patterns for both binding and dissociation because the peptides first bind to the lipid head groups and then become inserted further into the hydrocarbon region of the lipid bilayer (39Besenicar M.

https://openalex.org/W2169657386,"Regulation of MHC class I gene expression is critical to achieve proper immune surveillance. In this work, we identify elements downstream of the MHC class I promoter that are necessary for appropriate in vivo regulation: a novel barrier element that protects the MHC class I gene from silencing and elements within the first two introns that contribute to tissue specific transcription. The barrier element is located in intergenic sequences 3′ to the polyA addition site. It is necessary for stable expression in vivo, but has no effect in transient transfection assays. Accordingly, in both transgenic mice and stably transfected cell lines, truncation of the barrier resulted in transcriptional gene silencing, increased nucleosomal density and decreased histone H3K9/K14 acetylation and H3K4 di-methylation across the gene. Significantly, distinct sequences within the barrier element govern anti-silencing and chromatin modifications. Thus, this novel barrier element functions to maintain transcriptionally permissive chromatin organization and prevent transcriptional silencing of the MHC class I gene, ensuring it is poised to respond to immune signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2144963492,"Background Mammalian cardiac myocytes withdraw from the cell cycle during post-natal development, resulting in a non-proliferating, fully differentiated adult phenotype that is unable to repair damage to the myocardium, such as occurs following a myocardial infarction. We and others previously have shown that forced expression of certain cell cycle molecules in adult cardiac myocytes can promote cell cycle progression and division in these cells. The mitotic serine/threonine kinase, Polo-like kinase-1 (Plk1), is known to phosphorylate and activate a number of mitotic targets, including Cdc2/Cyclin B1, and to promote cell division. Principal Findings The mammalian Plk family are all differentially regulated during the development of rat cardiac myocytes, with Plk1 showing the most dramatic decrease in both mRNA, protein and activity in the adult. We determined the potential of Plk1 to induce cell cycle progression and division in cultured rat cardiac myocytes. A persistent and progressive loss of Plk1 expression was observed during myocyte development that correlated with the withdrawal of adult rat cardiac myocytes from the cell cycle. Interestingly, when Plk1 was over-expressed in cardiac myocytes by adenovirus infection, it was not able to promote cell cycle progression, as determined by cell number and percent binucleation. Conclusions We conclude that, in contrast to Cdc2/Cyclin B1 over-expression, the forced expression of Plk1 in adult cardiac myocytes is not sufficient to induce cell division and myocardial repair."
