https://openalex.org/W2072959381,"Experimental manipulations of fish in a Northern California river during summer base flow reveal that they have large effects on predators, herbivores, and plants in river food webs. California roach and juvenile steelhead consume predatory insects and fish fry, which feed on algivorous chironomid larvae. In the presence of fish, filamentous green algae are reduced to low, prostrate webs, infested with chironomids. When the absence of large fish releases smaller predators that suppress chironomids, algal biomass is higher, and tall upright algal turfs become covered with diatoms and cyanobacteria. These manipulations provide evidence that the Hairston, Smith, Slobodkin-Fretwell theory of trophic control, which predicts that plants will be alternately limited by resources or herbivores in food webs with odd and even numbers of trophic levels, has application to river communitics."
https://openalex.org/W2052579845,"The study of female preferences and the evolution of male traits has until recently centered on genetic coevolutionary mechanisms. An alternative mechanism posits that a preference results from a preestablished bias in the female information-processing system arising from sources independent of sexual selection. Male traits then arise that are selected by this preexisting preference. The genus Xiphophorus consists of swordless platyfish and swordtails. Swordlessness is the primitive state. In this study, female platyfish, X. maculatus, were found to prefer conspecific males with artificial swords over those without swords, despite evidence that the common ancestor of platyfish and swordtails was swordless. These results suggest that the evolution of the sword in the swordtail clade was a consequence of selection arising from a preexisting bias."

https://openalex.org/W2049087357,"The pressure dependence of the elastic wave velocities for hot-pressed, elastically isotropic polycrystals of the beta (modified spinel) phase of magnesium orthosilicate (Mg(2)SiO(4)) has been determined at room temperature to 3 gigapascals (GPa) by ultrasonic pulse interferometry. Pressure derivatives of the bulk (dK/dP = 4.8) and shear (dG/dP = 1.7) moduli derived from the travel times of the compressional (P) and shear (S) waves clearly demonstrate that the velocity contrast between the olivine and beta phases of Mg(2)SiO(4) decreases with increasing pressure. When combined with plausible values for the (as yet unmeasured) temperature derivatives, these new data can be used to calculate the contrast in P and S wave velocities across an olivine-beta phase transformation occuaring at pressure-temperature conditions corresponding to about 400 kilometers depth in the earth. The seismologically observed contrasts DeltaV in both P and S wave velocities constrain the percentage of orthosilicate in a model mantle of uniform chemical composition for appropriate relative magnitudes of the temperature (T) derivatives of the bulk and shear moduli for the beta phase. Allowed combinations of orthosilicate content (percent), dK/dT, and dG/dT (both in gigapascals per Kelvin) for a pair of recent seismological models with DeltaV(p) = DeltaV(s) 4.6% include (65, -0.018, -0.020), (55, -0.015, -0.018), and (45, -0.012, -0.016)."
