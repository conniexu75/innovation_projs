The remarkable development mentioned below certainly meets this requirement. It provides an outstanding example of interaction of results in two fields, strengthening theoretical conclusions in both of them."

https://openalex.org/W2018634281,SOME years ago I demonstrated1 that excised barley leaves from phosphorus-deficient plants showed considerably increased respiration intensities if their cut ends were immersed in neutral sodium phosphate solution instead of water. Feeding similar leaves with sucrose solution also increased the respirationrates ; but the increase was much smaller than when phosphorus was administered. The sucrose effect was less apparent when phosphorus deficiency was more acute. Still higher rates of respiration were obtained if the phosphorus-starved leaves were supplied with both sucrose and phosphate together.

This agglutinin was formed by a Polish patient, aged twenty-four, in response to pregnancies : the first ended in a stillborn macerated œtus at term, the second was successfully interrupted by Caesarean section during the thirty-seventh week. The patient was group A2 M CDe CDe Ken- and her husband B MN cDE cDE (or cDE cde) ; we could not distinguish between these genotypes owing to the lack of anti-d and anti-e sera. The baby proved to be group O MN CDe cDE Ken+."
https://openalex.org/W1964681242,"THERE is strong evidence that the nervous system controls the pituitary gland and its secretions ; but the exact nature of the control is undecided. General agreement exists about the importance of the nerve connexions for the normal functioning of the pars nervosa of the posterior lobe. The influence of the nerve supply on the adenohypophysis is, however, still under discussion and has been denied altogether. Experimental sections of the hypophyseal stalk and related hypothalamic structures have produced conflicting results ; but no alternative way of nerve supply has been established, and the stalk is still considered the most probable link between the pituitary body and the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W1970011773,"MORRIS1 has recently described the use of new reagent (0·2 per cent anthrone, a reduction product of anthroquinone, in 95 per cent sulphuric acid) for quantitative determination of carbohydrates. We have found that it can be used not only for distinguishing streptomycin B (a mannoside) from streptomycin A, but also for estimating the amount of the former present in a mixture. The glucosamine moiety, present in both molecules, apparently does not react with the reagent. Results obtained are in accord with those calculated from biological and chemical assays, making the accepted assumption about the relative biological activities of the two streptomycins."
https://openalex.org/W1974075312,"IN the editorial article in Nature of August 14, in criticizing a recent statement of the Atomic Scientists' Association, it is argued that collaboration between scientific men east and west of the 'Iron Curtain' may be undesirable, because it is likely ""to promote, for the present, a one-way traffic to the disadvantage of the Western democracies"". This view was expressed in the same words on July 14 by the editor of the Economist, who, professionally concerned as he must be with economic policy and its effect on foreign affairs, may be excused for including scientific ideas among the commodities available for exchange. But the same view expressed in Nature suggests a change in the traditional policy of the journal, which has always stressed the international aspects of science, and it shows strikingly the way in which military considerations can affect the outlook of scientific workers and lead them to adopt against their will a totalitarian view of their function. It is therefore necessary to inquire whether these military considerations really make it necessary to abandon the whole tradition of science, and to break off such contacts as are still possible with the scientific workers of Eastern Europe."

https://openalex.org/W2083392521,THE recent report by Dempster1 that the earlier conclusion of Wilkins and Dempster2 regarding the α-active isotope of samarium is unreliable makes necessary the revision of a great deal of past speculation. Previously the α-activity was assigned to 148Sm ; now it appears that 152Sm is almost certainly the isotope responsible.

Nothing illustrates the lapse of time more strikingly than one passage in the address of the president, Dr. William Carpenter. After referring to the expedition sent for the relief of Livingstone he added :"

The Section of Biology of the New York Academy of Sciences held a Conference on Biolumin-escence in November, 1946, and the papers submitted, which have now been published*, provide a comprehensive review of the subject."

https://openalex.org/W2013766943,"SHARK liver oil, which is one of the cheapest and most plentiful sources of vitamin A in Nature, has a highly disagreeable odour which is very much more pronounced than that of cod liver oil. On account of its unpalatability it does not easily find favour with the consumers. The deodorization of the oil has to be effected in such a manner that the highly susceptible vitamin A is retained intact. Among the various methods that we have tried to achieve this result are : (i) steam-'distillation' of the oil under normal and reduced pressure in which the malodorous substances pass over with the steam ; (ii) agitation of the oil with fermenting milk and toddy ; and (iii) selective hydrogenation of the oil in the presence of a nickel catalyst."

https://openalex.org/W2053389195,"ONE of the many problems arising from the study of tumour transplantation and of chemical carcinogens is the variable degree of susceptibility to cancer shown by different animal strains. This phenomenon has focused attention upon the hereditary basis of cancer, and a great wealth of experimental data has now accrued. The aim of the recent symposium on the Genetics of Cancer held in London during June 24–25, and sponsored jointly by the Genetical Society of Great Britain and by the British Empire Cancer Campaign, was to survey this field and direct attention to the significance of such recent discoveries in genetics as, for example, the role of cytoplasmic particles in heredity, differentiation and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2064863583,"SINCE February 1947, I have had the opportunity of making an intensive search for Folliculinids at Plymouth, where I found four species, and at Culler-coats where five species were discovered. Except for Folliculina (Folliculinopsis?) ampulla, no record of Folliculinid species existed at these two marine laboratories. Besides the six species already recorded by me for Great Britain1, a seventh species, Folliculinopsis (Metafolliculina) andrewsi (Hadzi), found by me both at Plymouth and at Cullercoats, should now be added to the list of British species."

https://openalex.org/W2983770929,"MR. H. FLETCHER MOULTON‘S paradox1 is ingenious, but easily resolved. The energies of two photons emitted at the same place are not equal if each energy is measured in the co-ordinate system of the moving body at which it is absorbed. Each observer measures wave-length and velocity in his own coordinate system, and deduces the frequency and energy to correspond. The same remark elucidates the mystery of the Doppler effect ; but it must be remembered here that each photon does not show this effect. If one single photon could be received, it would presumably show no Doppler effect (or, indeed, wave-length at all—this is the classical deduction from photo-electric phenomena) ; the wave decides the probability of the photon being found at any given point, or the distribution of the photons if they are present in sufficient numbers."
https://openalex.org/W4231428175,"AMONG the specific issues of policy on which the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy was asked to make recommendations shortly after its first meeting in March 1947 were the arrangements for securing an adequate flow of scientific man-power to meet the needs both of Government and of industry. One section of the Advisory Council's first annual report deals with this problem in some detail, and may well be regarded as the most important section of the report. Since the Barlow Committee recommended in May 1946 that the output of scientific workers should be doubled so as to provide about five thousand every year, it has become apparent that attainment of this expansion within the immediate future is improbable, if not impracticable under present conditions. Furthermore, while on one hand the desirability of an expansion at the recommended rate has been challenged on the ground of the probability of the supply exceeding demand, on the other, fears have been expressed that too large a proportion of the available new scientific talent is being attracted to the Government services and that industry is not obtaining the recruits it requires."
https://openalex.org/W4238882813,"THE Trustees of the Nuffield Foundation have published a report on the social medicine of old age prepared by Dr. J. H. Sheldon in a survey of a random sample of 477 old people*. His object was ""to discover the medical and mental condition of old people living at home, and the stresses and strains to which both they and the younger people caring for them may be subject"". The survey forms an appendix to the report entitled ""Old Age"", published by a Survey Committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Seebohm Rowntree. Wolverhampton was one of the towns covered by the Rowntree Report, and the same sample of people has provided the material for the new survey. The town, which has a population of 150,000, was selected because it was large enough to ensure a fair mixture of all income classes and sufficiently compact to enable the compiler to undertake the amount of visiting involved. Old age for the purposes of the survey has been taken to begin at sixty for women and sixty-five for men. The sample was obtained from the register of ration cards, every thirtieth name in the selected age group being included in the survey."
