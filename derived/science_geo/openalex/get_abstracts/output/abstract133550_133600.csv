https://openalex.org/W2319498663,A correlation has been observed between the dephosphorylation and downregulation of cPKC and the induction of apoptosis. This relationship is shown to be causal in COS cells where expression of dominant negative PKC alpha is shown to induce apoptosis. This response is rescued by co-expression of wild-type PKC alpha. The results demonstrate that PKC provides a survival signal that can be supplied by PKC alpha alone.

https://openalex.org/W2334338041,"Deregulated expression of cyclin D1 has been found in several types of human tumors. In order to investigate factors involved in human prostate cancer progression, we studied the effects of cyclin D1 overexpression on human prostate cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenicity by transfecting LNCaP cells with a retroviral vector containing human cyclin D1 cDNA. When compared to the parental and control-vector transfected LNCaP cells, these cyclin D1-transfected cells had more cells in S-phase and lower growth factor requirements. Furthermore, these cells grew more in androgen-free medium. We also detected higher levels of Rb phosphorylation and E2F-1 protein levels in LNCaP/cyclin D1 cells than that in the parental and vector control cells in medium with or without androgen. Cyclin D1 transfected clones formed tumors more rapidly than control and parental cells. These tumors were refractory to the androgen-ablation treatment by castration, whereas tumors from parental and vector-control LNCaP cells regressed within 4 weeks after castration. These results suggest that overexpression of cyclin D1 changes the growth properties, increases tumorigenicity and decreases the requirement for androgen stimulation in LNCaP cells both in vitro and in vivo."

Based on previous ultrastructural studies, short motifs which bind to the first SH3 domains of the adapters Crk and CRKL were selectively mutagenised to generate Crk/CRKL SH3-binding peptides of very high affinity and selectivity. Affinities were increased up to 20-fold compared to the best wildtype sequences, while the selectivity against a similar SH3 domain [Grb2SH3(N)] was not only retained, but sometimes increased. Blot techniques with GST-fusion peptides and in solution precipitation assays with biotinylated high affinity Crk binding peptides (HACBPs) were subsequently used to analyse the binding of these sequences to a large panel of SH3 domain-containing fusion proteins. Only those proteins which contained the CrkSH3(1) or CRKLSH3(1) domains bound efficiently to the HACBPs. A GST-HACBP fusion protein precipitated Crk and CRKL proteins out of 35S-labelled and unlabelled cell lysates. Very little binding of other cellular proteins to HACBP was detectable, indicative of a great preference for Crk and CRKL when compared to the wide variety of other endogenous cellular proteins. Moreover, HACBP disrupted in vitro preexisting Crk-complexes with DOCK180 and the exchange factors SoS and C3G, which are known targets of Crk adapters, in a concentration dependent manner. HACBP-based molecules should therefore be useful as highly selective inhibitors of intracellular signalling processes involving Crk and CRKL."
https://openalex.org/W2325182869,"A cDNA representational difference analysis (cDNA-RDA) and an arrayed filter technique were used to characterize transformation-related genes in oral cancer. From an initial comparison of normal oral epithelial cells and a human papilloma virus (HPV)-immortalized oral epithelial cell line, we obtained 384 differentially expressed gene fragments and arrayed them on a filter. Two hundred and twelve redundant clones were identified by three rounds of back hybridization. Sequence analysis of the remaining clones revealed 99 unique clones corresponding to 69 genes. The expression of these transformation related gene fragments in three nontumorigenic HPV-immortalized oral epithelial cell lines and three oral cancer cell lines were simultaneously monitored using a cDNA array hybridization. Although there was a considerable cell line-to-cell line variability in the expression of these clones, a reliable prediction of their expression could be made from the cDNA array hybridization. Our study demonstrates the utility of combining cDNA-RDA and arrayed filters in high-throughput gene expression difference analysis. The differentially expressed genes identified in this study should be informative in studying oral epithelial cell carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2318149353,"The dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) promoter is powerfully activated by the transcription factor Sp1. It has been suggested that Sp1 is a potential target for transcriptional regulation by the cell cycle regulator retinoblastoma protein (Rb), and so we have explored this possibility using the hamster dhfr gene as a model. By the use of DNA probes from the hamster dhfr gene promoter, containing the most proximal GC box (minimal promoter), and nuclear extracts from cultured hamster cells (CHO K1), we show that polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against Rb supershift the binding of Sp1. Nuclear extract immunoprecipitation with anti-Rb followed by Western analysis using anti-Sp1 also shows that Rb is complexed to Sp1. Complementary Immunoprecipitation/WB analysis shows both forms of Rb protein in the anti-Sp1 immunoprecipitates. Moreover, nuclear extract immunodepletion of Rb abolishes Sp1 gel-shift. The interaction between Rb and Sp1 is maintained in all the phases of the cell cycle. Transient overexpression of Rb in dhfr negative cells co-transfected with a dhfr minigene driven by its minimal promoter increases DHFR activity and potentiates transcription when overexpressing Sp1. Both effects are severely reduced when the co-transfections are performed with a homologous dhfr minigene containing a single point mutation in the GC box. Thus, the activation by Rb of the dhfr gene may be exerted through Sp1. Stable transfectants of pCMVRb in K1 cells show an increase in both mRNA and DHFR activity. It is concluded that Sp1 is physically associated with Rb, and that this association increases Sp1-mediated transcription of the hamster dhfr gene."
https://openalex.org/W2331403872,"Acute promyelocytic leukaemia is characterized by translocations that involve the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) locus on chromosome 17 and the PML locus on 15 or the PLZF locus on 11. The resulting abnormal translocation products encode for PML/RAR alpha or PLZF/RAR alpha fusion proteins. There is increasing experimental evidence that the APL-specific fusion proteins have similar biologic activities on differentiation and survival and that both components of the fusion proteins (PML or PLZF and RAR alpha) are indispensable for these biological activities. The physiologic function of PML or PLZF or whether PML and PLZF contribute common structural or functional features to the corresponding fusion proteins is not known. We report here immunofluorescence studies on the cellular localization of PLZF and PLZF/RAR alpha and compare it with the localization of PML and PML/RAR alpha. PLZF localizes to nuclear domains of 0.3-0.5 microns, approximately 14 per cell in the KG1 myeloid cell line. These PLZF-bodies are morphologically similar to the domains reported for PML (PML-NBs). There is tight spatial relationship between about 30% of PLZ-NBs and PML-NBs: they partially overlap. However, PML and PLZF do not form soluble complexes in vivo. PLZF- and PML-NBs are functionally distinct. Adenovirus E4-ORF3 protein expression alters the structure of the PML-NBs and interferon increases the number of PML-NBs and neither has any effect on PLZF NBs. The localization of PLZF/RAR alpha is different to that of PLZF and RAR alpha. The nuclear distribution pattern of PLZF/RAR alpha is one of hundreds of small dots (microspeckles) less than 0.1 micron. Expression of PLZF/RAR alpha did not provoke disruption of the PML-NBs. Co-expression of PML/RAR alpha and PLZF/RAR alpha in U937 cells revealed apparent colocalization. Overall the results suggest that the PML- and PLZF-NBs are distinct functional nuclear domains, but that they may share common regulatory pathways and/or targeting sequences, as revealed by the common localization of their corresponding fusion proteins."
