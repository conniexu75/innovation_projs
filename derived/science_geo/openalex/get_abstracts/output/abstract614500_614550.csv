https://openalex.org/W2929611936,"A high-energy neutrino event detected by IceCube on 22 September 2017 was coincident in direction and time with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056. Prompted by this association, we investigated 9.5 years of IceCube neutrino observations to search for excess emission at the position of the blazar. We found an excess of high-energy neutrino events with respect to atmospheric backgrounds at that position between September 2014 and March 2015. Allowing for time-variable flux, this constitutes 3.5{\sigma} evidence for neutrino emission from the direction of TXS 0506+056, independent of and prior to the 2017 flaring episode. This suggests that blazars are the first identifiable sources of the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux."
https://openalex.org/W2807128224,"Dopamine (DA) is a central monoamine neurotransmitter involved in many physiological and pathological processes. A longstanding yet largely unmet goal is to measure DA changes reliably and specifically with high spatiotemporal precision, particularly in animals executing complex behaviors. Here, we report the development of genetically encoded GPCR-activation-based-DA (GRABDA) sensors that enable these measurements. In response to extracellular DA, GRABDA sensors exhibit large fluorescence increases (ΔF/F0 ∼90%) with subcellular resolution, subsecond kinetics, nanomolar to submicromolar affinities, and excellent molecular specificity. GRABDA sensors can resolve a single-electrical-stimulus-evoked DA release in mouse brain slices and detect endogenous DA release in living flies, fish, and mice. In freely behaving mice, GRABDA sensors readily report optogenetically elicited nigrostriatal DA release and depict dynamic mesoaccumbens DA signaling during Pavlovian conditioning or during sexual behaviors. Thus, GRABDA sensors enable spatiotemporally precise measurements of DA dynamics in a variety of model organisms while exhibiting complex behaviors."

Organic ferroelectrics are desirable for their mechanical flexibility, low weight, environmentally friendly processing, and low processing temperatures. Although almost a century has passed since the first ferroelectric, Rochelle salt, was discovered, examples of highly desirable organic perovskite ferroelectrics are lacking. We found a family of metal-free organic perovskite ferroelectrics with the characteristic three-dimensional structure, among which MDABCO (N-methyl-N'-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium)–ammonium triiodide has a spontaneous polarization of 22 microcoulombs per square centimeter [close to that of barium titanate (BTO)], a high phase transition temperature of 448 kelvins (above that of BTO), and eight possible polarization directions. These attributes make it attractive for use in flexible devices, soft robotics, biomedical devices, and other applications."

Here, we report a large set of driver and reporter transgenic mouse lines, including 23 new driver lines targeting a variety of cortical and subcortical cell populations and 26 new reporter lines expressing an array of molecular tools. In particular, we describe the TIGRE2.0 transgenic platform and introduce Cre-dependent reporter lines that enable optical physiology, optogenetics, and sparse labeling of genetically defined cell populations. TIGRE2.0 reporters broke the barrier in transgene expression level of single-copy targeted-insertion transgenesis in a wide range of neuronal types, along with additional advantage of a simplified breeding strategy compared to our first-generation TIGRE lines. These novel transgenic lines greatly expand the repertoire of high-precision genetic tools available to effectively identify, monitor, and manipulate distinct cell types in the mouse brain."

A pivotal event in the emergence of plant life was the mid-Paleozoic adaptation to land. While several algal lineages evolved to occupy terrestrial environments, only one represents the land plant ancestor; its terrestrialization event was fostered by a range of evolutionary novelties. The specific complement of traits that allowed a particular algal lineage to give rise to land plants and dominate the terrestrial environment remains under active study. Similarity of critical plant developmental, sensory, and regulatory pathways to homologous pathways in charophyte green algae has been demonstrated in several recent studies, emphasizing the close relationship among these lineages (reviewed in Rensing, 2018Rensing S.A. Great moments in evolution: the conquest of land by plants.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2018; 42: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Charophytic algae are the closest living relatives of land plants (embryophytes), with both groups collectively referred to as streptophytes (Figure 1). The Charophyceae, Coleochaetophyceae, and Zygnematophyceae, together with the land plants, represent the clade Phragmoplastophyta (Lecointre and Le Guyader, 2006Lecointre G. Le Guyader H. The Tree of Life: A Phylogenetic Classification. Harvard University Press, 2006Google Scholar), united by the presence of the phragmoplast (Pickett-Heaps, 1975Pickett-Heaps J.D. Green Algae: Structure. Reproduction and Evolution in Selected Genera. Sinauer, 1975Google Scholar), an array of microtubules perpendicular to the cell division plane that functions in the formation of the nascent cell wall. The Klebsormidiophyceae, Chlorokybophyceae, and Mesostigmatophyceae share fewer traits with land plants (Figure 1). While Charophyceae were hypothesized to be most closely related to land plants on the basis of similar body plans (Pringsheim, 1862Pringsheim M. On the Pro-Embryos of the Charae.Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. 1862; 59: 321-326Crossref Google Scholar), recent studies indicated that the Zygnematophyceae are the land plant sister group (Wickett et al., 2014Wickett N.J. Mirarab S. Nguyen N. Warnow T. Carpenter E. Matasci N. Ayyampalayam S. Barker M.S. Burleigh J.G. Gitzendanner M.A. et al.Phylotranscriptomic analysis of the origin and early diversification of land plants.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: E4859-E4868Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Extant Zygnematophyceae have simple body plans that seem to reflect secondary loss of morphological complexity. In contrast, the earlier diverging Charophyceae are morphologically more complex than all other charophytic algae: the haploid thallus body plan encompasses a shoot-like axis consisting of nodes with whorls, internodes, a simplex apical meristem, and multicellular rhizoids (Figure 2). Cells of the internode are large and complex, featuring endo- and ectoplasma and multiple plastids and nuclei, and communicate via electrical signals. The morphology of extant charophytic groups thus infers mosaic evolution and suggests that the genomes of Charophyceae, not Zygnematophyceae, will likely reveal the suite of traits that facilitated terrestrialization (Delwiche, 2016Delwiche C.F. The genomes of charophyte green algae.Adv. Bot. Res. 2016; 78: 255-270Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Here, we present the genome sequence of the charophycean alga Chara braunii, one of the most morphologically complex extant Charophyta, shedding light on early embryophyte diversification and the colonization of land by plants. C. braunii features a haplontic life cycle (Figure 2); the draft sequence reported here represents a haploid genome. 1.75 Gbp of nuclear scaffold data were obtained, of which 1.43 Gbp were assembled into contigs, corresponding to ∼74% of the C. braunii genome. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of vegetative and reproductive stages was used together with full-length cDNA sequences to annotate the genome. 23,546 putative protein-coding gene models were identified, of which 53% are supported by RNA-seq data (Table S4). At least 94% of several conserved core gene sets are encoded by the genome, indicating its suitability for genomic and comparative analyses (STAR Methods). The observed chromosome number n = 14 (Figures S1 and S2) corresponds to the base chromosome number of Chara species. Indeed, synonymous substitution distance (Ks)-based analysis of C. braunii paralogs revealed no evidence of whole-genome duplication (WGD) events (Figure S3), and thus, paralog acquisition and retention are probably due to small-scale duplications. Repetitive elements (Tables S1F and S1G) collectively contribute approximately 1.1 Gbp (61%, or 75% if gaps are excluded). Unlike in most plants and green algae, there are no Copia-type long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons (RTs) detectable. We discovered a family of repeats with putative GIY-YIG-homing endonuclease and reverse transcriptase domains, which are hallmarks of Penelope RTs and group II introns that are uncommon in plant genomes.Figure S2Assembly Characteristics and Decontamination, Related to STAR MethodsShow full caption(A) k-mer frequency analysis of the S276 paired end read data with k = 25.

For C. braunii no single predicted WGD signature was supported by three different bandwidth kernel densities (cf. STAR Methods). The density of LTR elements in the genome is intermediate between compact genomes, like those of Arabidopsis thaliana or Klebsormidium nitens, and other large genomes, such as maize and barley (Figure 3). C. braunii introns are an order of magnitude longer than in any of the other genomes investigated here (Table S1L), although intron boundaries appear to be conserved. The high intron length coincides with a low number of introns per gene (3.82), similar to the value for the barley genome (3.89; Table S1L); intron length and number show negative correlation (r = −0.42). Repetitive elements represent 39% of the intron space (Figure 3; Mendeley archive), which is strikingly enriched with Penelope-like elements and depleted of other types of repeats, including class 2 transposable elements (Helitrons and DNA transposons), suggesting differential integration bias and/or retention in introns as compared to intergenic space (Table S1L). The lineage harboring C. braunii diverged from land plants 550–750 Ma (Morris et al., 2018Morris J.L. Puttick M.N. Clark J.W. Edwards D. Kenrick P. Pressel S. Wellman C.H. Yang Z. Schneider H. Donoghue P.C.J. The timescale of early land plant evolution.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115: E2274-E2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). By identifying features that are shared between the C. braunii genome and extant land plants, putative ancestral traits that have been retained over several hundred Ma can be identified. Here, we refer to the genes underlying these traits as land plant heritage genes (LPHGs) and similarly deduce evolutionary novelties. C. braunii, like land plants, performs cytokinesis by assembling a cell plate using a phragmoplast microtubule array while K. nitens divides by an evolutionarily older cleavage (Figure 1). Phragmoplast-mediated cell division is assumed to have enabled filament branching through a shift in the plane of cell division (Buschmann and Zachgo, 2016Buschmann H. Zachgo S. The Evolution of Cell Division: From Streptophyte Algae to Land Plants.Trends Plant Sci. 2016; 21: 872-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Land plants also evolved another microtubule array, the preprophase band (PPB), which functions in phragmoplast and cell plate guidance. Focusing on genes for phragmoplast and PPB function, a list of 221 A. thaliana cytokinesis genes was compiled (Table S1C). Sequence comparisons showed that the genomes of A. thaliana, Physcomitrella patens, C. braunii, and K. nitens have a highly similar complement of cytokinesis-related genes, while the unicellular chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is divergent. Interestingly, the C. braunii genome lacks the TANGLED1 gene. In land plants, microtubule-associated TANGLED1 localizes to PPBs and is required for phragmoplast guidance (Walker et al., 2007Walker K.L. Müller S. Moss D. Ehrhardt D.W. Smith L.G. Arabidopsis TANGLED identifies the division plane throughout mitosis and cytokinesis.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1827-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Since TANGLED1 homologs are found in several bryophytes, but none in any algae, this gene likely played an important role in PPB evolution (Figure 1). To gain further insight into the evolution of the phragmoplast, we determined how many paralogs each of the cytokinesis genes has in C. braunii as compared to K. nitens. In this way, we identified possible phragmoplast signature genes (Table S1C). Among others, we detected expansion of cyclins, as well as EXOCYST and SNARE complex members (Table S1C and Data S1Q–S1S). The expansion of phragmoplast-related gene families in C. braunii/the Phragmoplastophyta, but not in Chlorophyta, K. nitens, or Mesostigma viride, suggests their sub- and neofunctionalization to enable phragmoplast function. Like land plant cell walls, those of C. braunii consist of cellulose embedded within a pectin and hemicellulose matrix (Sørensen et al., 2011Sørensen I. Pettolino F.A. Bacic A. Ralph J. Lu F. O’Neill M.A. Fei Z. Rose J.K. Domozych D.S. Willats W.G. The charophycean green algae provide insights into the early origins of plant cell walls.Plant J. 2011; 68: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar); its synthesis is orchestrated by a repertoire of glycosyltransferases much like in land plants (Table S1H), with the exception of an apparently unique mechanism for xylan synthesis. The GT47 xylan synthase XYS1 has been identified in K. nitens, as well as IRX9 and IRX14 from GT43 (Data S1A), implicated in xylan biosynthesis despite no apparent requirement for being an active enzyme (Ren et al., 2014Ren Y. Hansen S.F. Ebert B. Lau J. Scheller H.V. Site-directed mutagenesis of IRX9, IRX9L and IRX14 proteins involved in xylan biosynthesis: glycosyltransferase activity is not required for IRX9 function in Arabidopsis.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e105014Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Orthologs to neither XYS1 nor IRX9/14 could be identified in C. braunii; however, a deep-branching, highly diverged form of GT43 was identified as the most likely C. braunii xylan synthase, providing the first hint that GT43 sequences are enzymatically involved in synthesizing xylan. Phytohormones enable the integration of environmental stimuli with developmental programs. As such, they are a key feature of land plants, with some apparently having origins in algae (Hori et al., 2014Hori K. Maruyama F. Fujisawa T. Togashi T. Yamamoto N. Seo M. Sato S. Yamada T. Mori H.

Auxin (AUX) is one of the major regulators of plant growth and development. Biosynthesis of AUX (Hori et al., 2014Hori K. Maruyama F. Fujisawa T. Togashi T. Yamamoto N. Seo M. Sato S. Yamada T. Mori H. Tajima N. et al.Klebsormidium flaccidum genome reveals primary factors for plant terrestrial adaptation.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as transcriptional and physiological response to high concentrations, have been shown in K. nitens (Ohtaka et al., 2017Ohtaka K. Hori K. Kanno Y. Seo M. Ohta H. Primitive Auxin Response without TIR1 and Aux/IAA in the Charophyte Alga Klebsormidium nitens.Plant Physiol. 2017; 174: 1621-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast to K. nitens, genes enconding biosynthetic enzymes of the TAA and YUCCA families are absent from C. braunii (Table 1). In C. australis IAA, serotonin and melatonin accumulate in a synchronized manner during the day/night cycle (Beilby et al., 2015Beilby M.J. Turi C.E. Baker T.C. Tymm F.J. Murch S.J.

Behav. 2015; 10: e1082697Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As the tryptamine IAA biosynthetic pathway intersects with the serotonin/melatonin pathway (Tivendale et al., 2014Tivendale N.D. Ross J.J. Cohen J.D. The shifting paradigms of auxin biosynthesis.Trends Plant Sci. 2014; 19: 44-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), Chara may synthesize and metabolize AUX via a different route than land plants. Homologous genes for both PINs and ABCBs are present in the C. braunii genome (Tables 1 and S1K), supporting previous data on polar AUX transport (PAT) in K. nitens (Hori et al., 2014Hori K. Maruyama F. Fujisawa T. Togashi T. Yamamoto N. Seo M. Sato S. Yamada T. Mori H. Tajima N. et al.Klebsormidium flaccidum genome reveals primary factors for plant terrestrial adaptation.Nat.

Bot. 2012; 63: 4213-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Homologous sequences for AUX1/LAX-like influx carriers, as well as the intracellular PIN-like (PILS) transporters, however, are absent from the C. braunii genome (Table 1), suggesting that AUX transport and homeostasis display an evolutionary history different from other streptophytes. The land-plant-type AUX signaling cascade, consisting of SCFTIR1/AFB and Aux/IAA co-receptors and AUX response factor (ARF) TFs, was suggested to be absent in K. nitens (Hori et al., 2014Hori K.

K. nitens encodes an Aux/IAA-domain-containing protein (Wang et al., 2015Wang C. Liu Y. Li S.S. Han G.Z. Insights into the origin and evolution of the plant hormone signaling machinery.Plant Physiol. 2015; 167: 872-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that features an additional B3 domain, is not induced by IAA (Ohtaka et al., 2017Ohtaka K. Hori K. Kanno Y. Seo M. Ohta H. Primitive Auxin Response without TIR1 and Aux/IAA in the Charophyte Alga Klebsormidium nitens.Plant Physiol. 2017; 174: 1621-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and is thus not classified as canonical Aux/IAA (Table 1). In addition to all components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Table S1I), C. braunii features a single ARF (Data S1E) with land-plant-like domain composition (Flores-Sandoval et al., 2018Flores-Sandoval E. Eklund D.M. Hong S.F. Alvarez J.P. Fisher T.J. Lampugnani E.R. Golz J.F. Vázquez-Lobo A. Dierschke T. Lin S.S. Bowman J.L. Class C ARFs evolved before the origin of land plants and antagonize differentiation and developmental transitions in Marchantia polymorpha.New Phytol. 2018; 218: 1612-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and two Aux/IAA-like sequences (Table 1 and Data S1F) clustering with the A. thaliana non-canonical IAA33 (lacking a TOPLESS-interacting motif and degron for AUX-dependent SCFTIR1/AFB-Aux/IAA interactions). C. braunii also encodes several F-box proteins (FBPs) with sequence similarity to land plant phytohormone co-receptors (Data S1P). None of the TIR1/AFB-like FBPs cluster with the land plant AUX co-receptor gene family (Data S1G). Our structural modeling, however, reveals that the C. braunii sequences adopt a solenoid-fold architecture resembling TIR1 (Tan et al., 2007Tan X. Calderon-Villalobos L.I. Sharon M. Zheng C. Robinson C.V. Estelle M. Zheng N. Mechanism of auxin perception by the TIR1 ubiquitin ligase.Nature. 2007; 446: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Ligand binding modeling supported the potential ability to form an AUX binding pocket (Data S1P). The existence of only degron-less C. braunii Aux/IAAs, however, prompts to postulate that a land-plant-like TIR1/AFB-Aux/IAA co-receptor pair is most likely not functional in C. braunii. Consequently, while obvious candidates for canonical land plant AUX biosynthesis genes are lacking, there is a partial candidate gene set of the major land plant AUX signaling and PAT pathways in C. braunii. In conclusion, AUX biosynthesis, transport, and some form of signaling were already present in the last common ancestor of C. braunii and K. nitens, but AUX signaling via ARFs was apparently gained in the common ancestor of Phragmoplastophyta, as was ARF repression by Aux/IAAs (Figure 4 and Table S1Q). The cytokinin (CK) signaling pathway consists of four protein families: the receptor, the histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein, and the types A and B response regulators (RRA and RRB) (Heyl et al., 2013Heyl A. Brault M. Frugier F. Kuderova A. Lindner A.C. Motyka V. Rashotte A.M. Schwartzenberg K.V. Vankova R. Schaller G.E. Nomenclature for members of the two-component signaling pathway of plants.Plant Physiol. 2013; 161: 1063-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The C. braunii genome encodes members of the first three, but no RRBs (Figure 4 and Table 1). This is in contrast to their presence in all chlorophytes and charophytes analyzed (Hori et al., 2014Hori K. Maruyama F. Fujisawa T. Togashi T. Yamamoto N. Seo M. Sato S. Yamada T. Mori H. Tajima N. et al.Klebsormidium flaccidum genome reveals primary factors for plant terrestrial adaptation.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2015Wang C. Liu Y. Li S.S. Han G.Z. Insights into the origin and evolution of the plant hormone signaling machinery.Plant Physiol. 2015; 167: 872-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Several RR domains closely related to RRBs were found, but none contained the Myb domain essential for RRB function (Table S1J). Given the complexity of the C. braunii genome, it is possible that not all genes were correctly or completely predicted, but neither genome nor transcriptome data (Data S1H) provide evidence for RRB genes. Their loss suggests either the rewiring of CK signaling or substitution of RRB function by other genes. The C. braunii genome possesses one or more potential homologs of all of the core components associated with ethylene (ETH) signaling (Figure 4 and Tables 1 and S1J). Chara exhibits ETH-binding activity (Wang et al., 2006Wang W. Esch J.J. Shiu S.H. Agula H. Binder B.M. Chang C. Patterson S.E. Bleecker A.B. Identification of important regions for ethylene binding and signaling in the transmembrane domain of the ETR1 ethylene receptor of Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3429-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and C. braunii encodes several ETH receptor homologs. Notably, C. braunii possesses a full-length homolog of EIN2, a central regulator in ETH signaling. This is in contrast to both the K. nitens genome, which lacks EIN2 (Hori et al., 2014Hori K. Maruyama F. Fujisawa T. Togashi T. Yamamoto N. Seo M. Sato S. Yamada T. Mori H. Tajima N. et al.Klebsormidium flaccidum genome reveals primary factors for plant terrestrial adaptation.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the Spirogyra pratensis transcriptome, which shows only a partial EIN2 sequence (Ju et al., 2015Ju C. Van de Poel B. Cooper E.D. Thierer J.H. Gibbons T.R. Delwiche C.F. Chang C. Conservation of ethylene as a plant hormone over 450 million years of evolution.Nat. Plants. 2015; 1: 14004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Except for EIN2, S. pratensis possesses an ETH signaling pathway that is functionally conserved with the pathway known in land plants (Ju et al., 2015Ju C. Van de Poel B. Cooper E.D. Thierer J.H. Gibbons T.R. Delwiche C.F. Chang C. Conservation of ethylene as a plant hormone over 450 million years of evolution.Nat. Plants. 2015; 1: 14004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the land-plant-like ETH signaling pathway was established in the common ancestor of the Phragmoplastophyta after its divergence from the lineage leading to Klebsormidium. Orthologs of the core abscisic acid (ABA) signaling components are present in bryophytes, and it has been suggested that all ABA biosynthesis/signaling components were gained in the common ancestor of Charophyta (Ju et a"

Based on the CA-Markov model, this study predicts the spatial patterns of land use in 2025 and 2036 based on the dynamic changes in land use patterns using remote sensing and geographic information system. CA-Markov integrates the advantages of cellular automata and Markov chain analysis to predict future land use trends based on studies of land use changes in the past. Based on Landsat 5 TM images from 1992 and 2003 and Landsat 8 OLI images from 2014, this study obtained a land use classification map for each year. Then, the genetic transition probability from 1992 to 2003 was obtained by IDRISI software. Based on the CA-Markov model, a predicted land use map for 2014 was obtained, and it was validated by the actual land use results of 2014 with a Kappa index of 0.8128. Finally, the land use patterns of 2025 and 2036 in Jiangle County were determined. This study can provide suggestions and a basis for urban development planning in Jiangle County."
https://openalex.org/W2884661296,"Summary Cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) recognition of cytosolic DNA is critical for immune responses to pathogen replication, cellular stress, and cancer. Existing structures of the mouse cGAS–DNA complex provide a model for enzyme activation but do not explain why human cGAS exhibits severely reduced levels of cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) synthesis compared to other mammals. Here, we discover that enhanced DNA-length specificity restrains human cGAS activation. Using reconstitution of cGAMP signaling in bacteria, we mapped the determinant of human cGAS regulation to two amino acid substitutions in the DNA-binding surface. Human-specific substitutions are necessary and sufficient to direct preferential detection of long DNA. Crystal structures reveal why removal of human substitutions relaxes DNA-length specificity and explain how human-specific DNA interactions favor cGAS oligomerization. These results define how DNA-sensing in humans adapted for enhanced specificity and provide a model of the active human cGAS–DNA complex to enable structure-guided design of cGAS therapeutics."

The hippocampus is crucial for many kinds of spatial memory (D’Hooge and De Deyn, 2001D’Hooge R. De Deyn P.P. Applications of the Morris water maze in the study of learning and memory.Brain Res.

The reorganization and reactivation of hippocampal maps predict spatial memory performance.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Consistent with this role, individual hippocampal neurons exhibit spatially modulated activity fields, or place fields, that encode the animal’s current location (O’Keefe, 1976O’Keefe J. Place units in the hippocampus of the freely moving rat.Exp. Neurol. 1976; 51: 78-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar) and collectively form a map-like representation of space (O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978O’Keefe J. Nadel L. The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. Clarendon Press, 1978Google Scholar). These observations suggest that hippocampal maps might serve to identify goal locations, but such a role seems incompatible with other aspects of hippocampal coding. Many neurons in the hippocampus are highly specific to the features of each environment (Muller and Kubie, 1987Muller R.U. Kubie J.L.

Independent codes for spatial and episodic memory in hippocampal neuronal ensembles.Science. 2005; 309: 619-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). While context-specific representations are likely beneficial for episodic memory (Burgess et al., 2002Burgess N. Maguire E.A. O’Keefe J. The human hippocampus and spatial and episodic memory.Neuron. 2002; 35: 625-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar), they seem poorly suited to guide goal-directed navigation. In each new environment, any downstream circuit sampling from the population would need to learn a new, idiosyncratic code to localize the goal. A potential solution for providing a context-invariant representation of the goal would be a specialized pool of cells (Burgess and O’Keefe, 1996Burgess N. O’Keefe J. Neuronal computations underlying the firing of place cells and their role in navigation.Hippocampus. 1996; 6: 749-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). If they existed, such cells would not track place per se, but the goal itself, similar to the encoding of other abstract categories (Quiroga et al., 2005Quiroga R.Q. Reddy L. Kreiman G. Koch C. Fried I. Invariant visual representation by single neurons in the human brain.Nature. 2005; 435: 1102-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, Lin et al., 2007Lin L. Chen G. Kuang H. Wang D. Tsien J.Z. Neural encoding of the concept of nest in the mouse brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 6066-6071Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Across different contexts, cells from the same population would be active near the goal even while the rest of the hippocampal ensemble remapped. If such cells provided information to other brain regions, they would likely be present in the output layers of the hippocampal formation, CA1 and the subiculum (van Strien et al., 2009van Strien N.M. Cappaert N.L.M. Witter M.P. The anatomy of memory: an interactive overview of the parahippocampal-hippocampal network.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). And if they reflected a signal that influenced perception and behavior, the timing of their activity would likely be correlated with the onset of motor activity related to goal approach (Mello et al., 2015Mello G.B.M.

Moreover, adding a goal to an environment typically introduces a host of associated sensory and behavioral features, such as visual or olfactory cues, or stereotyped motor behavior on approach to the goal or after reaching it. These associated features create a fundamental ambiguity: alterations to hippocampal activity might simply reflect the constellation of sensorimotor events near the goal (Deshmukh and Knierim, 2013Deshmukh S.S.

To test for the existence of specialized goal-encoding cells, we designed a virtual reality task in which activity near a goal location could be compared across multiple environments and also dissociated from confounding sensory and motor events. Because any cells encoding the goal would likely be a small population (Hollup et al., 2001Hollup S.A. Molden S. Donnett J.G. Moser M.-B. Moser E.I.

Mice learned to identify goals at multiple locations within the same or different environments, and the activity of thousands of individual neurons was tracked to identify whether any seemed specialized for being active near goals. Mice were trained to traverse a virtual reality environment in an enclosure that allowed simultaneous two-photon imaging at cellular resolution (Harvey et al., 2009Harvey C.D. Collman F. Dombeck D.A.

Membrane potential dynamics of grid cells.Nature. 2013; 495: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The virtual environment was a linear track with a variety of wall textures and colors that provided a unique visual scene at each point (Figure 1B; Figure S1A). Like many studies of goal-directed navigation, the goal used here was a reward presented at a fixed point in the environment. Mice were water restricted, and when they reached a certain location on the track (366 cm), a small water reward was delivered from a tube that was always present near the mouth. After the end of the track, the same pattern of visual features and reward delivery was repeated, creating the impression of an infinite repeating corridor. While mice interacted with the virtual environment, optical recordings of neural activity were made in CA1 and subiculum (Figure 1A). As in other studies in real and virtual environments (O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978O’Keefe J. Nadel L. The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map.

Note that the recording and cell-finding techniques were likely biased toward detecting neurons with greater activity, potentially increasing the fraction of cells with a spatial field compared to estimates from other techniques. The COMs of spatial fields were distributed throughout most of the track at uniform density (Muller et al., 1987Muller R.U. Kubie J.L. Ranck Jr., J.B.

Single unit activity in the rat hippocampus during a spatial memory task.Exp.

This enhancement of the representation near reward was consistent with previous studies in both real and virtual environments (Hollup et al., 2001Hollup S.A. Molden S. Donnett J.G. Moser M.-B.

Two possibilities were considered. First, the excess fields might have reflected an increased number of place fields, i.e., fields encoding a particular position on the track as defined by visual landmarks. Such fields might have formed at a higher rate near reward due to the salience of the location, increased occupancy time, or other factors (Hetherington and Shapiro, 1997Hetherington P.A. Shapiro M.L. Hippocampal place fields are altered by the removal of single visual cues in a distance-dependent manner.Behav. Neurosci. 1997; 111: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the excess fields might have encoded a factor related to the reward, in which case they could be dissociated from the reward-adjacent environmental cues. To distinguish these possibilities, we sometimes delivered the reward at a different point on the track, alternating block-wise throughout the session (condition AendAmid; Figure 1D). During reward location alternation sessions, many cells exhibited spatial fields (Table 1), and the fields of most cells remained in the same location. At the same time, the fields of some cells shifted to match the reward location. These two response types are illustrated for one session (Figure 1E): stable spatial fields were observed throughout the track (cells 1–3), while a separate population shifted to be consistently located near reward (cells 4–6). Stability versus shifting to track the reward was a discrete difference. Of cells active near the reward during Aend (Figure 1F, black bracket), those with spatial fields during Amid tended to be active in one of two locations: either near the same part of the track (blue band) or near the reward location at 166 cm (purple band). This pattern was significantly bimodal (p < 1e–5, Hartigan’s dip test), indicating that cells associated with reward formed a discrete subgroup and were thus distinct from those remaining active near the same visual landmarks. To identify response types in the entire population, we compared field locations for all cells with a spatial field in both contexts (Figure 1G). When the reward shifted, the fields of most cells either remained in the same location (blue arrow) or remapped randomly (background scatter), while a separate population shifted to be consistently active near reward (purple arrow). The latter group will be referred to as “reward-associated cells,” and they composed 4.2% of cells with fields in both conditions (0.8% of all recorded cells). Of the remaining cells, five response types were observed: cells with no spatial field in either condition (46.8% of all recorded cells), cells with a field in Aend only (17.8%), cells with a field in Amid only (15.8%), cells with a field in both contexts that shifted by less than 50 cm (10.9%), and cells with a field in both contexts that remapped to new, apparently random locations (7.9%). These response types are consistent with the well-characterized physiology previously described in CA1, in the subiculum, and throughout the hippocampal formation (Andersen et al., 2007Andersen P. Morris R. Amaral D.G. Bliss T. O’Keefe J. The Hippocampus Book. Oxford University Press, 2007Google Scholar), and they will be referred to as “place cells.” Against this backdrop, reward-associated cells stood out as a separate population, showing that at least some cells in the excess density were related to the reward rather than track position. An additional distinction can be made among reward-associated cells: some were active prior to reward delivery, and others were active at a location subsequent to the reward. While both might be relevant for navigation, cells active before reward are particularly noteworthy, since their activity could not be explained as a response to either visual cues or reward delivery and consumption. Instead, they must have been driven by an expectation signal that arose internally, encoding either a specific behavior or a cognitive state associated with reward anticipation, a distinction that will be considered below. In either case, reward-associated cells with fields located prior to both rewards will be referred to as “reward-predictive cells,” in the sense that their field locations consistently indicated where the reward would be delivered even before it arrived. The name is not intended to suggest that they necessarily play a role in memory or reward-prediction tasks, though these possibilities will be considered. Among reward-associated cells, 34% were reward predictive, 34% had fields located subsequent to both rewards, and the remainder had fields before one reward and after the other. Although reward-predictive cells did not seem to form a discretely different subset, in subsequent sections they will be singled out for consideration because their activity was most readily comparable to reward anticipation behavior. If reward-associated cells were truly specialized to encode reward, downstream circuits would likely benefit from those signals arising from the same cell population in each environment. Contrary to the consistency that this scheme requires, hippocampal representations seem to be largely randomized in different spatial contexts (Leutgeb et al., 2005Leutgeb S. Leutgeb J.K. Barnes C.A.

Hippocampal ensemble dynamics timestamp events in long-term memory.eLife. 2015; 4: e12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether reward-associated activity would be re-assigned to different cells in a new environment or instead arise from the same population. To distinguish these possibilities, a separate cohort of mice was trained on a new paradigm, condition AB (Figure 2A), in which mice alternated block-wise between the original track (track A) and a second, shorter track with distinct visual textures (track B, Figure S2A). On track B, reward was also delivered near the end, and on both tracks, spatial fields occurred at increased density near reward (Figure S2B). As mice alternated between tracks A and B, the fields of some cells shifted to different, apparently random locations, while others were consistently active near reward, indicating that reward-associated cells formed a separate group. These two response types are illustrated for several cells in Figure 2B, and they were shown to be representative in several population-level analyses. Across the tracks, most spatial fields shifted in a manner consistent with global remapping. Field locations (Figure 2D) spanned the complete range of possible shifts, and their density appeared approximately uniform, possibly excepting regions near reward. This effect was confirmed quantitatively by comparing to a previous study that observed global remapping and employed similar recording techniques (Danielson et al., 2016Danielson N.B. Zaremba J.D. Kaifosh P. Bowler J. Ladow M. Losonczy A.

That study found that the average population vector correlation across two distinct physical treadmills was 0.22, while in the present study, the equivalent value was 0.099 (95% confidence interval 0.094 to 0.103). This comparison confirmed that switching between tracks A and B elicited global remapping and provided further evidence that virtual environments are capable of reproducing much of the same hippocampal phenomenology that has been characterized using other methods (Harvey et al., 2009Harvey C.D. Collman F. Dombeck D.A. Tank D.W. Intracellu"

Certain rice varieties, known as deepwater rice, survive periodic flooding and consequent oxygen deficiency by activating internode growth of stems to keep above the water. Here, we identify the gibberellin biosynthesis gene, SD1 (SEMIDWARF1), whose loss-of-function allele catapulted the rice Green Revolution, as being responsible for submergence-induced internode elongation. When submerged, plants carrying the deepwater rice-specific SD1 haplotype amplify a signaling relay in which the SD1 gene is transcriptionally activated by an ethylene-responsive transcription factor, OsEIL1a. The SD1 protein directs increased synthesis of gibberellins, largely GA4, which promote internode elongation. Evolutionary analysis shows that the deepwater rice-specific haplotype was derived from standing variation in wild rice and selected for deepwater rice cultivation in Bangladesh."

It was previously thought that a single microtubule spindle is responsible for spatially combining the two genomes and then segregating them to create the two-cell embryo.

These two spindles aligned their poles before anaphase but kept the parental genomes apart during the first cleavage. This spindle assembly mechanism provides a potential rationale for erroneous divisions into more than two blastomeric nuclei observed in mammalian zygotes and reveals the mechanism behind the observation that parental genomes occupy separate nuclear compartments in the two-cell embryo."

Our findings thus reveal the rapid remodeling of the axonal proteomic landscape by extrinsic cues and uncover a logic underlying attraction versus repulsion. The generation of neuronal networks requires neurons to connect to their synaptic partners with precision. This process is mediated through axon navigation, guided by the growth cone, which senses growth and guidance factors and transduces these signals to regulate the speed and direction of axon extension, often long distances away from the soma. Growing axons contain complex transcriptomes (Zivraj et al., 2010Zivraj K.H. Tung Y.C. Piper M. Gumy L. Fawcett J.W. Yeo G.S. Holt C.E.

It is not known whether cues elicit large-scale translational changes across the axonal transcriptome or whether different guidance molecules trigger the translation of different subsets of mRNAs. A recent genome-wide analysis on the ribosome-associated mRNAs revealed a complex and dynamically regulated translatome in retinal axons in vivo (Shigeoka et al., 2016Shigeoka T. Jung H. Jung J. Turner-Bridger B. Ohk J. Lin J.Q. Amieux P.S. Holt C.E. Dynamic axonal translation in developing and mature visual circuits.Cell. 2016; 166: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This approach, however, did not provide information to distinguish the cue-induced translatome from the basal translatome and did not address the question of cue-specific up- and downregulation of newly synthesized proteins (NSPs). These questions require an unbiased analysis of the cue-induced nascent proteome in the axonal compartment over a short timescale. The characterization and quantification of the nascent proteome of whole cells or tissue samples by metabolic labeling methods, such as pulsed stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (pSILAC) or bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), are straightforward due to sample abundance and typical labeling periods of hours (Schwanhäusser et al., 2009Schwanhäusser B.

Nascent proteome remodeling following homeostatic scaling at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 2016; 92: 358-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, a systematic analysis of the nascent proteome from very low sample amounts of a subcellular compartment, uncontaminated by the soma, over a short timescale (<20 min) remains a major challenge (Eichelbaum and Krijgsveld, 2014Eichelbaum K. Krijgsveld J. Rapid temporal dynamics of transcription, protein synthesis, and secretion during macrophage activation.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2014; 13: 792-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To overcome these challenges, we applied pSILAC in a compartmentalized chamber in combination with ultrasensitive sample preparation technology, termed single-pot solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3) (Hughes et al., 2014Hughes C.S. Foehr S. Garfield D.A. Furlong E.E. Steinmetz L.M. Krijgsveld J. Ultrasensitive proteome analysis using paramagnetic bead technology.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2014; 10: 757Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). This enabled us to characterize and quantify the system-wide proteome dynamics in response to specific guidance cues from tiny amounts (≤2 μg) of somaless retinal axons on a timescale of minutes. Further, we used this unbiased highly sensitive approach to investigate the axonal proteomic changes that characterize the switch between repulsive and attractive chemotropic responses. Our results revealed that hundreds of proteins, encompassing a wide range of cellular functions, are rapidly translated within the axonal compartment in basal conditions and in response to guidance cues. Comparative analysis of cue-induced newly synthesized proteomes revealed more than 100 nascent protein species regulated within just 5 min, some distinctly associated with specific guidance cues and some common to all cues. When cue-induced responses are switched from repulsion to attraction, a fraction of a common subset of NSPs undergo opposite regulation. Collectively, our data show rapid nascent proteome remodeling in response to guidance molecules and uncover subsets of opposite proteomic changes involved in the switch between repulsive and attractive chemotropic responses. First, we tested whether the SP3 approach (Hughes et al., 2014Hughes C.S. Foehr S. Garfield D.A. Furlong E.E. Steinmetz L.M. Krijgsveld J. Ultrasensitive proteome analysis using paramagnetic bead technology.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2014; 10: 757Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) was sufficiently sensitive for detecting the nascent proteome of axons of a single cell type within 5 min in basal (non-stimulated) conditions. To obtain isolated axons, we cultured intact whole-eye primordia from Xenopus laevis embryos in compartmentalized transfilter chambers (Figure 1A) (Willis and Twiss, 2011Willis D.E. Twiss J.L. Profiling axonal mRNA transport.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 714: 335-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Explanted whole eyes maintain their anatomical integrity in culture, and only the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) exit the eye to grow through the 1 μm pores of the transfilter onto the lower surface (Figure 1A). Immunostaining of eye sections with specific markers verified the exclusive presence of RGC axons exiting the eye (Figures S1A–S1C) and the absence of nuclei and dendrites (Figures S1D and S1E) on the lower surface of the transfilter. Axonal purity was further demonstrated by RT-PCR, showing the presence of β-actin mRNA and of the axonal marker microtubule-associated protein Tau (Mapt) mRNA (Figure 1B; Figure S1F) (Leung et al., 2006Leung K.M. van Horck F.P. Lin A.C. Allison R. Standart N. Holt C.E. Asymmetrical beta-actin mRNA translation in growth cones mediates attractive turning to netrin-1.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, Litman et al., 1993Litman P. Barg J. Rindzoonski L. Ginzburg I. Subcellular localization of tau mRNA in differentiating neuronal cell culture: implications for neuronal polarity.Neuron. 1993; 10: 627-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and the absence of somal and dendritic mRNAs in the axonal material collected from the transfilter (Figure 1B; Figure S1F). Given the limited availability of axonal material, we assessed the detection sensitivity of the SP3 protocol on axon samples derived from 100 eye explants (≤2 μg protein typical yield) (Hughes et al., 2014Hughes C.S. Foehr S. Garfield D.A. Furlong E.E. Steinmetz L.M. Krijgsveld J. Ultrasensitive proteome analysis using paramagnetic bead technology.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2014; 10: 757Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). SP3-MS (mass spectrometry) analysis identified more than 1,000 proteins (Figure 1D; Table S3). In line with our results on axonal purity (Figures S1D–S1F), the RGC marker γ-synuclein was detected in the axonal proteome, whereas dendrite markers were absent (Table S3). To investigate the newly synthesized proteome, we incubated retinal cultures for 1 hr in medium depleted of lysine and arginine. Subsequently, the cell bodies were eliminated by eye removal from the upper surface of the transfilter, and the somaless axons on the lower transfilter surface were incubated for 5 min with “Medium” (M) isotope-coded amino acids (Lys4, Arg6). After lysis, the pSILAC axon samples were processed by SP3 prior to MS analysis (Figure 1C). pSILAC-SP3 detected an average of 350 NSPs that incorporated the labeled amino acids under basal conditions following a 5 min pulse of SILAC in a ≤2 μg axonal sample (Figure 1D; Table S3). The distribution of the M label incorporation rate in NSPs relative to total protein, calculated as (M/(M+L))/5 min, where “Medium” represents the basally NSPs and “Light” (L) indicates the pre-existing proteins, showed that protein synthesis occurs at a basal level in non-stimulated axons and that signals, although low, were consistently detectable (median = 1.4% of the total signal; Figure 1E). Samples were analyzed in biological triplicate to assess reproducibility, which yielded an average Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.6 between replicates (Figure S1G), higher than the PCC derived from 20 min BONCAT-pSILAC previously carried out on ∼107 RAW 264.7 macrophages (PCC = −0.11; Eichelbaum and Krijgsveld, 2014Eichelbaum K. Krijgsveld J. Rapid temporal dynamics of transcription, protein synthesis, and secretion during macrophage activation.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2014; 13: 792-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These data indicate that approximately one-third of the axonal proteome is synthesized locally (Figure 1D). A positive correlation was found between the abundance of pre-existing proteins and NSPs (Figure S1H), indicating borderline detection of de novo synthesis for low-abundance proteins due to the sample scarcity and short timescale. The ratios between newly synthesized and pre-existing proteins correlated negatively with the abundance of the pre-existing proteins (PCC = −0.5; Figure S1I), suggesting that the average basal translation rate is relatively constant for the majority of the proteins. To gain insight into the potential function of basal protein synthesis in developing axons, we conducted functional Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. “ribosome and translation” was the most-enriched category (Figure 1F), consistent with evidence from the in vivo mouse axonal translatome (Shigeoka et al., 2016Shigeoka T. Jung H. Jung J. Turner-Bridger B. Ohk J. Lin J.Q. Amieux P.S. Holt C.E. Dynamic axonal translation in developing and mature visual circuits.Cell. 2016; 166: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The “proteasome complex” was also significantly enriched (Figure 1F), in line with the in vivo mouse axonal translatome and with previous work showing that ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) components are abundant in growth cones and that axonally synthesized proteins undergo a particularly high degree of UPS-dependent turnover (Deglincerti et al., 2015Deglincerti A. Liu Y. Colak D. Hengst U. Xu G. Jaffrey S.R. Coupled local translation and degradation regulate growth cone collapse.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A further highly enriched cluster was the “extracellular region part,” containing extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Of note, these categories were much more enriched than the “actin binding” one (Figure 1F). Similar to the GO analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment in “ribosome,” “cell adhesion molecules,” and “ECM-receptor interaction” pathways (Figure 1G). KEGG analysis also highlighted several metabolic pathways linked to amino acid synthesis, such as “histidine metabolism” and “glycolysis,” suggesting that the axon is equipped with its own biosynthetic processes and energy supply (Figure 1G; Figure S1L). Several of the metabolic NSPs belonged to the “mitochondrion” and “mitochondrial matrix” GO categories (Figure S1L). Categories related to stress and apoptosis were absent, consistent with evidence showing that axons deprived of their cell bodies do not exhibit anatomical signs of degeneration up to ∼3 hr (Harris et al., 1987Harris W.A. Holt C.E. Bonhoeffer F. Retinal axons with and without their somata, growing to and arborizing in the tectum of Xenopus embryos: a time-lapse video study of single fibres in vivo.Development. 1987; 101: 123-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results demonstrate that NSPs can be detected in extremely small quantities of subcellular material within minutes by pSILAC-SP3. Furthermore, they show that developing axons basally synthesize proteins encompassing a wide range of cellular functions, suggesting the capacity to locally replenish metabolic proteins and machineries subject to high protein turnover. To investigate whether guidance cues induce a proteome-wide response and whether it changes over time, we carried out pSILAC-SP3 on somaless axons stimulated with three different cues present along the visual pathway (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF], Netrin-1, and Semaphorin3A [Sema3A]), together with “heavy” (H) isotope labels (Lys8, Arg10), for 5, 15, and 30 min. Control somaless axon samples were incubated simultaneously with M isotope labels (Lys4, Arg6). Subsequently, in each independent replicate, control and cue-stimulated samples sharing the same pulse duration were lysed, pooled, and processed through SP3 (Figure 1C). To obtain ∼2 μg of axonal material, we explanted 100 eye primordia per transfilter, yielding <5,000 axons, and cultured more than 1,800 eyes for each single replicate. The MS analysis revealed up to 500 quantified NSP changes per cue stimulation undergoing a similar trend across the biological replicates (meeting the requirements (1) quantified in >50% of biological replicates, (2) standard deviation (SD) ≤ 1, (3) average log2(H/M) > |0.3|) and up to 166 significant NSP changes per cue stimulation, thus indicating that guidance cues cause wide-scale remodeling of the nascent proteome (Figure 2; Table S3). This large set of changes was reproducibly detected after just 5 min of cue stimulation (up to 108 significant NSP changes). Whereas previous studies have mainly shown that some mRNAs can be translated in response to cue stimulation, our data revealed that, in addition to upregulation, several NSPs undergo cue-induced downregulation (Figure 2), thus indicating tight control of the axonal nascent proteome in both directions. As expected, given the limiting rate of protein synthesis, the NSPs upregulated in response to cues at the 5 min time point are shifted slightly toward a smaller size with respect to the axonal proteome size distribution (Figure S2A). We next asked how cue-induced NSP changes correlate with the abundance of their local transcripts by comparing the mRNA levels in retinal growth cones of Xenopus stage 32 (Zivraj et al., 2010Zivraj K.H.

This yielded a significant but low positive correlation (ρ = 0.33; Figure S2B), as seen in other systems (Gygi et al., 1999Gygi S.P. Rochon Y. Franza B.R. Aebersold R.

(Lond.). 2014; 114: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The results suggest that cue-induced NSP changes, supported to some degree by local transcriptome levels, rapidly remodel the axonal nascent proteome on a wide scale in both up and down directions. To validate the pSILAC-SP3 data, we used two orthogonal methods: (1) puromycylation combined with proximity ligation assay (puro-PLA) to quantify protein synthesis (Figures 3A–3C; Figure S3A; Table S1) (tom Dieck et al., 2015tom Dieck S. Kochen L. Hanus C. Heumüller M. Bartnik I. Nassim-Assir B. Merk K. Mosler T. Garg S. Bunse S. et al.Direct visualization of newly synthesized target proteins in situ.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and (2) quantitative immunofluorescence (qIF) to measure the overall total protein level (Figures 3D and 3E; Figure S3A; Table S1). For puro-PLA, the use of one single antibody and rabbit IgG served as two independent negative controls, confirming the absence of a non-specific signal (Figure 3B; Figure S3A). Sixteen NSP changes were chosen from the proteomic dataset for validation, representing proteins across different functional categories, in stimulated and non-stimulated conditions, after various pulses of SILAC (5, 15, or 30 min) and exhibiting different average log2 ratios (Table S1). We confirmed the two negative controls (Figures 3A and 3B) whose transcripts were not detected in axons (Figure 1B) and successfully validated 15 out of 16 NSP changes (Figures 3B–3E; Figure S3A). The majority of the mRNAs corresponding to the validated NSPs were previously detected in axons (Table S1). The pSILAC and fluorescence-based “cue/control condition” ratios showed a strong positive correlation (PCC = 0.81) (Figure 3F). The correlation was higher for the puro-PLA data than the immunofluorescence (IF) data, which was expected due to the higher degree of specificity of the puro-PLA method that detects only the NSPs and not total protein. For example, at 5 min, both pSILAC and puro-PLA revealed that Sema3A upregulates histone H4 translation (Figures 3B and 3C; Table S1), whereas the total protein amount of H4 does not change at 5 min and significantly decreases following 15 min Sema3A stimulation (Figure S3B). This decrease is blocked by Ciliobrevin A, a dynein inhibitor that prevents retrograde transport (Figure S3B) (Firestone et al., 2012Firestone A.J. Weinger J.S. Maldonado M. Barlan K. Langston L.D. O’Donnell M. Gelfand V.I. Kapoor T.M. Chen J.K. Small-molecule inhibitors of the AAA+ ATPase motor cytoplasmic dynein.Nature. 2012; 484: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), suggesting that H4 may be transported back to the nucleus after being locally translated in response to Sema3A. This indicates that the amount of total protein does not necessarily correlate with the amount of locally synthesized protein and illustrates a further dynamic complexity in the proteomic response to cues. It should be noted that while pSILAC-SP3 was carried out on axons plus growth cones (Figure 1C), the validation above was carried out on single growth cones as these are easily identifiable by their expanded morphology, aiding accurate quantification of the immunofluorescence signal per unit area, whereas retinal axons often fasciculate together in bundles, making quantitative measurement more challenging. To test the validity of growth cone sampling on axons, we selected one of the growth-cone-validated NSP changes (puro-Pdi PLA in response to 15 min Sema3A stimulation; Figures 3B, 3C, and 3F) and conducted qIF on the axon shaft (distal 20 μm segment). The results correlated with both the growth cone qIF values and the pSILAC (Figures S3C and S3D; Figure 3F; Table S1), indicating consistency between the two types of sampling analyses (growth cone versus axon). We also interrogated the pSILAC datasets for proteins previously reported to be axonally translated in basal conditions or in response to the same cues and stimulation time used in our experiments. The analysis confirmed the pSILAC-SP3 detection of the majority of protein changes (8/10), including some from axons of other species and types of neurons (Table S2). The 2/10 protein changes not detected by pSILAC-SP3 were previously reported in mouse cortical and hippocampal growth cones and identified in the retinal axonal translatome (Table S2) (Shigeoka et al., 2016Shigeoka T. Jung H. Jung J. Turner-Bridger B. Ohk J. Lin J.Q. Amieux P.S. Holt C.E. Dynamic axonal translation in developing and mature visual circuits.Cell. 2016; 166: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This suggests that either the pSILAC-SP3 approach has limited sensitivity due to the paucity of axonal sample and the rapid timescale or that not all responses to cues are conserved among different species. Finally, we compared the pSILAC-SP3 outcome in response to cues versus the mRNAs bound in vivo to ribosomes in the RiboTag mouse RGC axons at three developmental stages: embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5) (axon elongation), postnatal day 0.5 (P0.5) (axon branching), and P7.5 (pruning) (Shigeoka et al., 2016Shigeoka T.

The abundance of the NSPs showed a positive correlation with the RiboTag data (Figure S3E), although this was unsurprisingly low given the difference between the in vitro and the in vivo context (e.g., axons experience multiple cues simultaneously in the tectum) and the different species. Next, we asked whether the newly synthesized proteome is dynamic over the 30 min period of stimulation. Both common and different NSP changes were detected among different cue stimulation periods (5 min, 15 min, 30 min; Figure 4A).

As a result of this enhanced role of the public, citizen science demonstrates more diversity and flexibility than traditional science and can encompass efforts that have no institutional affiliation, are funded entirely by participants, or continuously or suddenly change their scientific aims. But these structural differences have regulatory implications that could undermine the integrity, safety, or participatory goals of particular citizen science projects. Thus far, citizen science appears to be addressing regulatory gaps and mismatches through voluntary actions of thoughtful and well-intentioned practitioners. But as citizen science continues to surge in popularity and increasingly engage divergent interests, vulnerable populations, and sensitive data, it is important to consider the long-term effectiveness of these private actions and whether public policies should be adjusted to complement or improve on them. Here, we focus on three policy domains that are relevant to most citizen science projects: intellectual property (IP), scientific integrity, and participant protections."

Overweight and obesity during pregnancy have been associated with high birth weight and an increased risk of childhood obesity, reinforcing the risk of other non-communicable diseases. Obesity involves chronic low-grade systemic inflammation. New biomarkers for early detection of obesity risk are urgently required. The aim of this study was to identify the connection between pregestational BMI (pre-BMI) status and inflammatory biomarkers during the third trimester of pregnancy and their association with intestinal microbiota composition. Fifty-four pregnant women were classified according to pre-pregnancy BMI as normoweight, overweight, or obese. Weight gain, inflammatory biomarkers (hs_CRP, haptoglobin, and suPAR), and microbiota composition were assessed during the third trimester. A significant lower weight gain for obese mothers and a positive correlation between pre-BMI and inflammatory biomarkers were detected (Spearman’s correlation). Haptoglobin levels were significantly higher in overweight and obese mothers. Higher Firmicutes levels and a higher ratio Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes were observed in the overweight and obese subjects. High hs_CRP and haptoglobin levels were also correlated with decreased microbiota diversity (Shannon index), whereas haptoglobin and hs_CRP values were correlated with several microbiota components, such as Ruminococcus gnavus and Faecalibacterium, and with specific phyla in the normoweight and overweight mothers; no significant associations with microbiota were found for suPAR. In conclusion, haptoglobin and hs_CRP reflected pregestational BMI status and related microbiota components, but haptoglobin was a better biomarker for microbiota associated with overweight. suPAR was associated with low grade inflammation dependent on pre-pregnancy BMI, but it was not related to deviated microbiota profiles."

Here, we examined whether treatment with recombinant IL-37 ameliorates established insulin resistance and obesity-induced inflammation. WT mice were fed a HFD for 22 weeks and then treated daily with IL-37 (1 μg/mouse) during the last 2 weeks. Compared with vehicle only–treated mice, IL-37–treated mice exhibited reduced insulin in the plasma and had significant improvements in glucose tolerance and in insulin content of the islets. The IL-37 treatment also increased the levels of circulating IL-1 receptor antagonist. Cultured adipose tissues revealed that IL-37 treatment significantly decreases spontaneous secretions of IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and CXC motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL-1). We also fed mice a 60% fat diet with concomitant daily IL-37 for 2 weeks and observed decreased secretion of IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6 and reduced intracellular levels of IL-1α in the liver and adipose tissue, along with improved plasma glucose clearance.

https://openalex.org/W2884837278,"The enhanced expression of miR-31 has been observed in many human malignancies including lung cancer, and this microRNA regulates several aspects of oncogenesis. However, the role of miR-31-5p in energy metabolism remains elusive. Here, we confirm that H1299 and A549 cells, 2 lung cancer cell lines, relay on aerobic glycolysis as main source of ATP. Inhibition of miR-31-5p leads to decreased glycolysis and ATP production, while miR-31-5p overexpression increases them. Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) up-regulates the expression of glycolytic enzymes, and the HIF-1α inhibitor (FIH) inhibits HIF-1 activity. Because FIH is a direct target of miR-31-5p, inhibition of miR-31-5p results in enhanced FIH expression and suppression of HIF-1 signaling, while over-expression of miR-31-5p has the opposite effects. Via this mechanism, miR-31-5p up-regulates aerobic glycolytic genes and maintains energy homeostasis. To further validate the mechanism of miR-31-5p in glycolysis regulation, we show that overexpression or knockdown of FIH rescued the effects of miR-31-5p or miR-31-5p inhibitor on HIF activation and its target gene expression, respectively. Finally, by means of an A549 cell xenograft mouse model, we demonstrate that the miR-31-5p promotes cell proliferation via enhancing glycolysis.

https://openalex.org/W2884235242,"A new technique for more accurate automatic segmentation of the kidney from its surrounding abdominal structures in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is presented. This approach combines a new 3D probabilistic shape model of the kidney with a first-order appearance model and fourth-order spatial model of the diffusion-weighted signal intensity to guide the evolution of a 3D geometric deformable model. The probabilistic shape model was built from labeled training datasets to produce a spatially variant, independent random field of region labels. A Markov-Gibbs random field spatial model with up to fourth-order interactions was adequate to capture the inhomogeneity of renal tissues in the DW-MRI signal. A new analytical approach estimated the Gibbs potentials directly from the DW-MRI data to be segmented, in order that the segmentation procedure would be fully automatic. Finally, to better distinguish the kidney object from the surrounding tissues, marginal gray level distributions inside and outside of the deformable boundary were modeled with adaptive linear combinations of discrete Gaussians (first-order appearance model). The approach was tested on a cohort of 64 DW-MRI datasets with b-values ranging from 50 to 1000 s/mm2. The performance of the presented approach was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross validation and compared against three other well-known segmentation methods applied to the same DW-MRI data using the following evaluation metrics: 1) the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC); 2) the 95-percentile modified Hausdorff distance (MHD); and 3) the percentage kidney volume difference (PKVD). High performance of the new approach was confirmed by the high DSC (0.95±0.01), low MHD (3.9±0.76) mm, and low PKVD (9.5±2.2)% relative to manual segmentation by an MR expert (a board certified radiologist)."
https://openalex.org/W2883034331,"Background A dietary imbalance or a disregard for the nutritional needs of children during early childhood can affect their growth. From the age of six months, breast milk is no longer able to meet the energy and micronutrient needs of children; the consumption of adequate complementary foods is therefore essential. Various indicators have been used to assess the quality of children's diets, and the dietary diversity score is a good indicator of children's diets. The objective of this study was to describe the dietary practices of children in rural areas of Moramanga and Morondava, Madagascar, and to identify the determinants of low dietary diversity to prioritize nutritional interventions. Methods We collected dietary data in 2014 on children aged 6–59 months in a study on the determinants of chronic malnutrition using the 24-hour recall method. Data on the characteristics of households and mothers were also collected. We carried out bivariate and multivariate analyses to identify the determinants of low dietary diversity scores for children. Results We included 1824 children: 893 from Moramanga and 931 from Morondava. Approximately 42.1% [95% CI: 39.0–45.4] of the children from Moramanga and 47.6% [95% CI: 44.4–50.8] of those from Morondava had a poorly diversified diet, consisting mainly of foods rich in carbohydrates and poor in meat products. Poor maternal education was associated with a high likelihood of having a non-varied diet in both study areas; the adjusted odds ratios were 2.2 [95% CI: 1.3–3.8] and 4.0 [95% CI: 2.5–6.4] for children from mothers with lower education levels for Moramanga and Morondava, respectively. For children recruited in Morondava, having low household socioeconomic status (adjusted OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2–2.8) and belonging to a household without livestock was associated with a low dietary diversity score (adjusted OR: 1.8, 95% CI 1.2–2.7). Conclusion Our results show the need to improve girls' education, adapt nutrition education programs for mothers based on their level of education, and strengthen poverty reduction programs."
https://openalex.org/W2884528210,"Introduction A combination of platelet and lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) (abbreviated as COP-LMR) has been recently evaluated as systemic inflammatory marker for prognostication in lung cancer. While previous study on COP-LMR has evaluated its prognostic value in NSCLC patients who underwent curative resections, the combination of these two markers has not been evaluated in advanced NSCLC yet. Objectives In this study, we evaluated the prognostic value of COP-LMR in stage IV NSCLC with malignant pleural effusion under active anticancer treatment. Methods Between January 2012 and July 2016, 217 patients with stage IV NSCLC and MPE undergoing active anticancer treatment were selected for evaluation. If patients had both low LMR (< 2.47) and increased platelet (> 30.0 ×104 mm-3), they were assigned to COP-LMR group 2. Patients with one parameter were assigned to COP-LMR group 1. If none, patients were assigned to COP-LMR group 0. Results Median overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001), progression free survival (PFS) (P < 0.001) and histological feature (P = 0.003) showed significant differences among COP-LMR groups. For COP-LMR groups 0, 1 and 2, median survival times were 35.9, 14.7 and 7.4 months, respectively, while median progression free times were 19.2, 13.3 and 7.4 months, respectively. Older age, male, low albumin, high CRP and high COP-LMR (0 vs 1, P = 0.021, hazard ratio (HR): 1.822, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.096–3.027 and 0 vs 2, P = 0.003, HR: 2.464, 95% CI: 1.373–4.421) were independent predictive factors for shorter OS. Age, sex, histology, albumin, or CRP had no significant influence on PFS. High COP-LMR was the significant factor in predicting shorter PFS (0 vs 1, P = 0.116 and 0 vs 2, P = 0.007, HR: 1.902, 95% CI: 1.194–3.028). Conclusions A combination of pretreatment LMR and platelet levels can be used to predict short survival in stage IV NSCLC patients who underwent active anticancer treatment."

This anti-inflammatory protective mechanism, known as the “cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway” (CAP), is anatomically located in the efferent arm of a neuronal circuit of vagal fibers whose activation counteracts excessive inflammation via a reflex mechanism (7Borovikova L.V.

In this context, our group conducted a pilot study in patients with sepsis that revealed, for the first time in humans with this pathology, the connection between α7-nAChRs and CAP after demonstrating that the α7 gene expression level in patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) is a clinically relevant marker for CAP activity (15Cedillo J.L.

The human CHRNA7 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q13-q14 region) and has 10 exons that encode for a protein of around 57 kDa, the α7-nAChR subunit. A new hybrid gene (CHRFAM7A) resulting from a fusion of a partial duplication of CHRNA7 (from exons 5 to 10) with the FAM7A gene has been identified at 1.6 Mb upstream from the parent gene and in the opposite orientation (16Gault J.

Thus, CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A are highly homologous (>99%) from exon 5 to the 3′-UTR region. The acquisition of this duplication seems to be a recent evolutionary event because it only appears in humans after divergence from other higher primates (18Locke D.P. Archidiacono N. Misceo D. Cardone M.F. Deschamps S. Roe B. Rocchi M. Eichler E.E.

Furthermore, CHRFAM7A is polymorphic with more than 95% of the population carrying one or two copies of the gene (see Ref. 19Costantini T.W. Dang X. Coimbra R. Eliceiri B.P. Baird A.

The CHRFAM7A transcript is translated to a protein of around 41–45 kDa (depending on glycosylation), the dupα7 subunit, which shares all the structural elements of the full-length α7 subunit, except for a substantial part of the N-terminal region containing the signal peptide and the agonist-binding domain. Interestingly, dupα7 and α7 subunits are naturally expressed in the same human cell types (see Ref. 19Costantini T.W. Dang X. Coimbra R. Eliceiri B.P. Baird A.

However, a specific function for the dupα7 subunit was long unidentified until our group found that it acted as a dominant-negative regulator of the α7-nAChR function in a pioneering electrophysiological study carried out on Xenopus oocytes (21de Lucas-Cerrillo A.M. Maldifassi M.C. Arnalich F. Renart J. Atienza G. Serantes R. Cruces J. Sánchez-Pacheco A. Andrés-Mateos E. Montiel C.

This finding was corroborated shortly afterward in a study also performed in oocytes (25Araud T. Graw S. Berger R. Lee M. Neveu E. Bertrand D. Leonard S. The chimeric gene CHRFAM7A, a partial duplication of the CHRNA7 gene, is a dominant-negative regulator of α7*nAChR function.Biochem.

Indersmitten T. Freedman R. Leonard S. Lester H.A. The duplicated α7 subunits assemble and form functional nicotinic receptors with the full-length α7.J. Biol.

Whether or not, as occurs in oocytes, dupα7 has a biological role that interferes with α7-nAChR function in mammalian cell types other than neuroblastoma cells, particularly immune cells, has not yet been evaluated. The main difficulty in approaching this type of study lies in the high homology of the peptide sequences for the dupα7 and α7 subunits that cause the commercially available antibodies to cross-react with both subunits in immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, and immunoprecipitation experiments. To circumvent the above limitation, we prepared several epitope- and fluorescent protein-tagged α7 and dupα7 constructs to be transfected into GH4C1 rat pituitary cells and RAW264.7 murine macrophages. Combining coimmunoprecipitation, Föster resonance energy transfer (FRET), immunocytochemistry, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry (FC), and ELISAs, we have investigated whether dupα7 interacts with α7 subunits in these mammalian cell types, as well as the possible functional repercussion of this interaction by assessing its effects on the α7-nAChR–mediated anti-inflammatory response in RAW264.7 macrophages upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Finally, we have translated our experimental findings to human sepsis, a disorder accompanied by immune dysregulation and excessive activation of the inflammatory response. Thus, in the context of this last pathology, we have studied whether the dupα7 subunit would be able to interfere with the control of inflammation by α7-nAChRs. To address this issue, we have used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to determine the absolute dupα7 mRNA expression level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with sepsis with the aim of analyzing its relationship with PBMC α7 mRNA levels and with the inflammatory state of patients. These cells do not naturally express α7 or dupα7 subunits; therefore, they were chosen at the beginning of our study to analyze the cellular distribution of each subunit after separate or combined transfection of the α7-HA.pcDNA3.1 and dupα7.pcDNA3.1/Myc-His constructs. Representative confocal images in Fig. 1, A and B, left panels, show the expression efficiency of α7-HA (red) or dupα7-Myc (green) subunits after immunostaining their respective epitopes. Images in Fig. 1, A and B, middle panels, of the same cells also show their plasma membrane (green and red, respectively) labeled with Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). Pooled results obtained from three different cultures reveal that 17 ± 3 and 11 ± 2% of transfected cells efficiently expressed the α7 or dupα7 subunits, respectively. When confocal images obtained from monitoring α7 or dupα7 were superimposed over fluorescent WGA-stained cell membranes, both signals only colocalized in the cells expressing α7 subunits but not in those expressing dupα7 (Fig. 1A, white arrows in the merged image). This latter finding is corroborated by using the “colocalization function” of the Leica software (see under “Experimental procedures”) to generate an image of double-positive structures (white dots) that identifies the coinciding labeling region of nAChR subunits and the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C). The double-labeled pixels show that a significant proportion of α7 subunits reach the cell membrane, in contrast to the poor ability of the dupα7 subunits to migrate to this cellular structure. The next experiments were designed to qualitatively analyze the effect of dupα7 transfection on the expression level of α7 subunits at the GH4C1 cell surface using the Leica software “colocalization function.” The cells were transfected with the α7-pmCherry construct, alone or in combination with the dupα7-pGFP construct (1:1 ratio). Fig. 1D shows representative confocal images of two WGA-stained cells (blue) transfected as mentioned above. The double-positive structures (Fig. 1D, white dots) that reflect the expression level of α7 subunits in the cell membrane are drastically reduced after coexpression of dupα7 (left versus middle panels). This reduction could be derived from the intracellular entrapment of α7 subunits by dupα7 subunits (Fig. 1D, yellow color in the merged image on right). This entrapment takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as can be deduced from the confocal image of the cell coexpressing α7-Cherry and dupα7-GFP subunits, after staining (blue) this intracellular structure (Fig. 1G, white color in the merged image). To quantitatively evaluate the effect of dupα7 on the expression level of α7-Cherry subunits in the cytosolic membrane of WGA-stained GH4C1 cells transfected as described above, we proceeded to analyze the colocalization between pixels generated by the two fluorophores (Cherry and Alexa Fluor 633–WGA) using the Pearson's correlation and the Manders's overlap coefficients. These two coefficients, which are available in the ImageJ JACoP plugging software, measure correlation and co-occurrence, respectively, and they are the metrics most widely used to quantify the degree of colocalization in fluorescence microscope images (27Bolte S. Cordelières F.P. A guided tour into subcellular colocalization analysis in light microscopy.J.

Results reveal that both coefficients were significantly reduced by dupα7 coexpression (Fig. 1E). Finally, the immunoblots from the same cell culture (representative from two independent experiments) of protein extracts from cells transfected with α7-Cherry alone, or combined with different proportions of dupα7-GFP, and probed with the anti-Cherry or anti-GFP antibodies allow us to exclude the possibility that, at a 1:1 ratio, the dupα7 effect on cell-surface expression of α7 subunits was due to interference in the α7 mRNA translation to the corresponding protein (Fig. 1F). Therefore, this α7/dupα7 ratio was the one used whenever the double transfection of the α7 and dupα7 constructs was required to analyze either the cell-surface expression level or the functional activity of the α7-nAChR in the rest of the study. Using three complementary experimental approaches (confocal imaging of colocalization, coimmunoprecipitation, and FRET) in GH4C1 cells cotransfected with several pairs of α7 and dupα7 constructs, we have evaluated whether α7 and dupα7 subunits physically interact to form heteromeric nAChRs in mammalian cells. The pair α7-HA/dupα7-Myc was used for colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation assays, whereas α7-GFP/dupα7-Cherry or dupα7-GFP/α7-Cherry were the two pairs selected for FRET studies. Fig. 2A shows confocal images of α7-HA (red) or dupα7-Myc (green) subunits expressed in cells doubly transfected with the pair α7-HA.pcDNA3.1/dupα7.pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (ratio 1:1); each subunit was detected after immunostaining its corresponding epitope. The image at the right on Fig. 2A shows the overlap of the two signals with the arrows indicating the colocalization sites (yellow) of both subunits in the cells in which the joint expression has occurred. The ability of dupα7 to assemble with α7 subunits in the same receptor was evaluated in the cell lysates from the above doubly-transfected cells subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) of the dupα7-Myc subunit with the anti-Myc antibody. In parallel, total lysates from cells transfected separately with α7-HA.pcDNA3.1 or dupα7.pcDNA3.1/Myc-His and not subjected to immunoprecipitation were used as references. Fig. 2B shows two typical blots from the same cell culture corresponding to the above cell lysates probed with the anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies. As expected, single bands corresponding to the predicted sizes for the α7 (57 kDa) or dupα7 (41 kDa) subunits were found in the total lysates from cells respectively transfected with either α7-HA or dupα7-Myc constructs. Analysis of the IP lysate from cells doubly-transfected with both constructs allowed the simultaneous identification of the two bands corresponding to α7-HA and dupα7-Myc, providing strong evidence for coassembly of both subunits in a heteropentameric receptor. Data are representative of two independent experiments. In further agreement with the above findings, confocal FRET imaging analysis in cells transfected with the pair of constructs α7-pGFP/dupα7-pmCherry or dupα7-pGFP/α7-pmCherry (1:0.5 or 1:1 ratio) provides additional evidence that both nAChR subunits were in sufficient proximity to interact with each other as part of a heteropentameric receptor. Fig. 2C shows confocal images acquired before (pre) and after (post) acceptor (dupα7-Cherry) photobleaching at 561 nm in the framed area; the increase in emission at 488 nm of the donor (α7-GFP (post)) in the two cells analyzed after coexpression of the α7-GFP/dupα7-Cherry pair in the indicated proportions is worth noting. The lower panel of Fig. 2D shows mean ± S.D. of the FRET efficiency values, expressed as a percentage of the maximum efficiency, obtained in the region selected for acceptor photobleaching in individual cells transfected with the two pairs of constructs assayed in this study at the 1:0.5 or 1:1 ratios. The significant increase in FRET efficiency when dupα7 was the donor of the pair or when the proportion of the acceptor increased in the pair is also worth noting. The increase in FRET efficiency when dupα7 is the donor of the pair agrees with previous observations in mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro2A) after analyzing the dupα7/α7 interaction by FRET using several pairs of fluorescent protein-fused α7 and dupα7 constructs (26Wang Y. Xiao C. Indersmitten T. Freedman R. Leonard S. Lester H.A. The duplicated α7 subunits assemble and form functional nicotinic receptors with the full-length α7.J. Biol.

The authors of the previous study justified their results by the low expression of dupα7 subunits compared with that of α7 subunits considering that a dupα7 subunit (acting as a donor) was more likely to lie adjacent to one α7 subunit in the heteromeric nAChR. The next experiments were designed to evaluate whether physical interaction of dupα7 with the α7 subunits found in GH4C1 cells also occurs in another mammalian cell type that naturally expresses functional α7-nAChRs, the murine macrophage RAW264.7 cell line. If so, we would proceed to evaluate whether the dupα7 interaction with endogenous α7 subunits interfered with the cell-surface expression and function of α7-nAChRs expressed by these immune cells. The representative confocal image of a group of RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 3A, left panel) shows the endogenous α7 subunits (green) immunostained with the primary antibody Mab306. Fig. 3A (right panel) corroborates the efficient expression of foreign dupα7 subunits (green) after cell nucleofection with the dupα7-Myc construct. FRET efficiency analysis in cells nucleofected with the two pairs of constructs α7-pGFP/dupα7-pmCherry or dupα7-pGFP/α7-pmCherry-N1 (1:0.5 or 1:1 ratio) again showed that both nAChR subunits are in sufficient proximity so as to interact with each other as part of a heteropentameric receptor in this immune cell type. Thus, Fig. 3B (upper panel) shows a representative confocal image acquired after photobleaching α7-Cherry in the framed area, which produces a marked increase in dupα7-GFP fluorescence; at the right, a false color image shows the increase in FRET efficiency (yellow/red colors in the selected area) under the experimental conditions just described.

This study compares health service access between women with and without disabilities in general and explores the challenges encountered by women with disabilities in accessing maternal healthcare services during pregnancy. Methods A mixed method study was conducted in Rupandehi district of Nepal implementing a cross-sectional survey among 354 women including 79 women with disabilities, supplemented by 43 in-depth interviews. Descriptive and bivariate statistical analysis of quantitative data using Pearson’s Chi-square test for association was carried out, while qualitative data were analysed following the theme content analysis using a framework approach. Results The vast majority of women from both groups, women with and without disabilities (71% vs 74%) reported that the nearest health facility from their location was more than 30 minutes walking distance (P>0.05). Half of the women with disabilities walked to health facilities for ANC check-ups. Over one-third of women without disabilities and a slightly lesser proportion of women with disabilities (29%) used a low-cost means of transport (rikshaw, bi/tri-cycles) (P>0.05). Distribution of health facilities found uneven and poorly linked with road transport facilities. None of the health facilities accommodated the needs of women with disabilities with accessible buildings and convenient opening time. The travel cost and the extra cost of services, staff shortage, often delayed and inadequate drug supplies were common problems for both women with and without disabilities. Unavailability of beds during delivery, insensitive providers with negative attitudes and abusive behaviour, inadequate knowledge and experience in providing services to the people with disabilities as well as unwelcoming health facility environment made services particularly inaccessible to women with disabilities. Conclusion Maternal healthcare services are not easily and equitably accessible to women with disabilities. To increase access to healthcare for this vulnerable group, improvements are needed in distribution and management of resources from transportation through service delivery, as well as improved provider knowledge and awareness of a human rights approach to disability and health."

Using a shortest-path algorithm we developed, we mapped HTS hits to the CFTR interactome to provide functional context to the targets and identified the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3a (eIF3a) as a central hub for the biogenesis of CFTR. Of note, siRNA-mediated silencing of eIF3a reduced the polysome-to-monosome ratio in F508del-expressing cells, which, in turn, decreased the translation of CFTR variants, leading to increased CFTR stability, trafficking, and function at the cell surface. This finding suggested that eIF3a is involved in mediating the impact of genetic variations in CFTR on the folding of this protein. We posit that the number of ribosomes on a CFTR mRNA transcript is inversely correlated with the stability of the translated polypeptide. Polysome-based translation challenges the capacity of the proteostasis environment to balance message fidelity with protein folding, leading to disease. We suggest that this deficit can be corrected through control of translation initiation. Inherited and somatic rare diseases result from >200,000 genetic variants leading to loss- or gain-of-toxic function, often caused by protein misfolding. Many of these misfolded variants fail to properly interact with other proteins.

We have previously reported that T cells alone are sufficient to reject allogeneic murine ESC derivatives; and strategies that inhibit T-cell activation, including coreceptor and costimulation blockade, prevent hESC derivatives from being rejected. This study aimed to investigate, in addition to T cells, whether macrophages contribute to transplant rejection of hESC xenografts with nonobese diabetic (NOD)/SCID mice that lack functional T and B cells but have macrophages. We show that acute rejection against hESC-derived endothelial cells (hESC-ECs) was mediated, to some degree, by infiltrating macrophages that phagocytosed them. Transgenic expression of murine CD47 on cell surface of hESC-ECs mitigates macrophage-mediated phagocytosis and improves their survival after transplantation. Our results highlight that innate immune cells, such as macrophages, can reject hESC derivatives, raising concern against the use of NOD/SCID as transplant recipients for testing in vivo function of hESC-derived tissues. Augmenting CD47 signaling promotes survival and function of hESC derivatives after xenogeneic transplantation.-Leung, C. S., Li, J., Xu, F., Wong, A. S. L., Lui, K. O.

Trimethoprim inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and thereby is an indirect inhibitor of nucleic acid synthesis. Due to the basicity of trimethoprim, two pH levels (5 and 7) were selected which mimicked healthy urine pH. This also allowed investigation of the effect on bacterial metabolism when trimethoprim exists in different ionization states. UHPLC-MS was employed to detect trimethoprim molecules inside the bacterial cell and this showed that at pH 7 more of the drug was recovered compared to pH 5; this correlated with classical growth curve measurements. FT-IR spectroscopy was used to establish recovery of reproducible phenotypes under all 8 conditions (3 drug levels and control in 2 pH levels) and GC-MS was used to generate global metabolic profiles. In addition to finding direct mode-of-action effects where nucleotides were decreased at pH 7 with increasing trimethoprim levels, off-target pH-related effects were observed for many amino acids. Additionally, stress-related effects were observed where the osmoprotectant trehalose was higher at increased antibiotic levels at pH 7. This correlated with glucose and fructose consumption and increase in pyruvate-related products as well as lactate and alanine. Alanine is a known regulator of sugar metabolism and this increase may be to enhance sugar consumption and thus trehalose production. These results provide a wider view of the action of trimethoprim. Metabolomics indicated alternative metabolism areas to be investigated to further understand the off-target effects of trimethoprim."

Previous work demonstrated a role for the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 in regulating cardiomyocyte apoptosis. We therefore investigated Nur77 in the hopes of identifying novel relaxin regulators. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) data indicated that ectopic expression of orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 markedly increased the expression of latexin-3 (RLN3), but not relaxin-1 (RLN1), in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVMs). Furthermore, we found that the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO) markedly stimulated RLN3 expression, and this stimulation was significantly attenuated in Nur77 knockdown cardiomyocytes and Nur77 knockout hearts. We showed that Nur77 significantly increased RLN3 promoter activity via specific binding to the RLN3 promoter, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Furthermore, we found that Nur77 overexpression potently inhibited ISO-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, whereas this protective effect was significantly attenuated in RLN3 knockdown cardiomyocytes, suggesting that Nur77-induced RLN3 expression is an important mediator for the suppression of cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) 3The abbreviations used are: miRNAmicroRNAmiRNPmicroribonucleoproteinsXPDxermoderma pigmentosum group DMMXDMMS19–MIP18–XPD. regulate numerous cellular functions and disease processes. The most well-established mechanism mediating the action of miRNAs is that miRNAs reduce target mRNA stability or repress protein translation via interactions with argonautes and other microribonucleoproteins (miRNPs) within the miRNA-induced silencing complex (1Bartel D.P.

The seed region sequences of miR-29a and miR-29b are identical, and thus predicted mRNA targets are shared (Targetscan) (8Kriegel A.J. Liu Y. Fang Y. Ding X. Liang M.

Moreover, miR-29a, similar to most miRNAs, is enriched in the cytoplasm, whereas a significant amount of mature miR-29b is found in the nucleus based on imaging and biochemical studies (4Hwang H.W. Wentzel E.A. Mendell J.T. A hexanucleotide element directs microRNA nuclear import.Science. 2007; 315 (17204650): 97-10010.1126/science.1136235Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified an effect of miR-29b on nuclear morphology during cell division that was not shared by miR-29a. Further, we identified a protein that interacted with miR-29b, but not miR-29a, and is involved with both nuclear morphology in cell division and nuclear localization of miR-29b. We examined the effect of blocking miR-29a or miR-29b on nuclear morphology in HeLa cells 24 h after release from a double synchronization. The sequences of miR-29a and miR-29b differ by five nucleotides outside of the seed region, which allowed the design of anti-miRs specific for each isomer. Anti–miR-29b transfection induced large irregularly shaped nuclei, including multinucleated cells, nuclear lobulation, or rings of small amounts of nuclear material (Fig. 1A), in nearly 12% of the cells (Fig. 1B). Remarkably, the nuclear irregularities occurred far more frequently in cells transfected with anti–miR-29b than in cells transfected with anti–miR-29a or a scrambled control anti-miR (Fig. 1, A and B). It is unlikely that all cells were in cell cycle stages that permit the manifestation of irregular nuclei. The percentage of cells in appropriate cell cycle stages that exhibit the observed nuclear irregularities, therefore, was likely greater than 12%. The distinct effects of miR-29a and miR-29b on nuclear morphology were associated with distinct subcellular localization of the isomers. miR-29b was colocalized with centrosomal protein γ-tubulin when γ-tubulin formed a single cluster just outside of the nucleus at a phase of the cell cycle when the nucleus is still intact (Fig. 1C). Controls demonstrating anti-miR and probe specificity for in situ hybridization experiments are displayed in Fig. S1. The perinuclear cluster could be the microtubule-organizing center (reviewed in Ref. 10Hinchcliffe E.H. Centrosomes and the art of mitotic spindle maintenance.Int. Rev. Cell Mol.

In contrast, miR-29a was detected throughout the cell as one would expect for a typical miRNA. It did not form distinct clusters and was not colocalized with γ-tubulin in perinuclear clusters (Fig. 1D). We developed an approach that utilized tagged, synthetic miRNA duplexes, rapid cryopreservation, and proteomics to identify miRNPs that interacted specifically with miR-29a or miR-29b in HeLa cells. Synthetic miR-29a or miR-29b duplexes tagged with biotin at their 3′ end (Fig. S2) retained some ability to knock down known target mRNAs of miR-29 (7Helwak A. Kudla G. Dudnakova T. Tollervey D.

ANT2 is known to interact with the MMS19–MIP18–XPD (MMXD) complex involved in the formation of mitotic spindles (4Hwang H.W. Wentzel E.A. Mendell J.T.

We therefore focused subsequent studies on testing whether ANT2 was a viable candidate for explaining the effect of miR-29b on nuclear morphology. Two biochemical approaches and an imaging approach were employed to validate ANT2 and miR-29b were parts of a molecular complex. miR-29a was used as a stringent control for miR-29b. First, Western blotting analysis confirmed the presence of ANT2 in protein samples affinity-purified from cells transfected with biotinylated miR-29b, but not biotinylated miR-29a or scrambled miR-29b oligonucleotides (Fig. 2A). Second, ANT2 and its interacting partners were isolated from untransfected HeLa cells by immunoprecipitation using an ANT2 antibody. The immunoprecipitated complexes obtained contained an enrichment of endogenous, native miR-29b relative to miR-29a, compared with whole cell lysate or immunoprecipitated complexes obtained using an IgG isotype control antibody (Fig. 2B). Third, colocalization between endogenous, native miR-29b and ANT2 was observed in intact cells. Although nuclear localization of miR-29b was observed in many cells, clustering of ANT2 just outside the nucleus was only observed when ANT2 was colocalized with miR-29b (Fig. 2C) in early mitosis when the nucleus is still intact in HeLa cells (∼9 h after release from a double thymidine block). Perinuclear clusters of colocalized miR-29b and ANT2 were also observed in NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 2D). When cells were released from the double thymidine block into nocodazole, a compound that induces depolymerization of centrosomal microtubules, one large cluster of miR-29b/ANT2 was no longer observed. Rather, the smaller aggregates of colocalized fluorophores were observed scattered throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2E), suggesting the perinuclear colocalization of miR-29b and ANT2 was associated with microtubule organization at the centrosome. Where ANT2 was not colocalized with miR-29b, a low level of ANT2 was observed throughout the cytoplasm, consistent with the known presence of ANT2 in mitochondria. Rescue experiments were used to verify the specificity of the anti-miR oligonucleotides, as well as the in situ hybridization probes used in these experiments (Fig. 2F). Probes for both miR-29a and miR-29b produced unique, highly specific signals in response to transfection with pre–miR-29a and pre–miR-29b, respectively. Further, these experiments demonstrate that delivery of synthetic miR-29b, but not miR-29a, rescues the abnormal nuclear phenotype induced by anti–miR-29b transfection (Fig. 2, F and G). We then determined whether the perinuclear clustering of miR-29b with ANT2 required argonaute 2 (EIF2C2). We found, again, that nearly all of the clusters of miR-29b and ANT2 were colocalized just outside of the nucleus in cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA (Fig. 3, A and B). Knockdown of EIF2C2 with siRNA did not have any effect on the colocalization of ANT2 and miR-29b clusters (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, we found that when EIF2C2 was knocked down, most nuclei no longer stained positive for miR-29b (Fig. 3, A and B). These data suggest that nuclear translocation of miR-29b is an EIF2C2-dependent process, whereas colocalization of miR-29b and ANT2 in clusters just outside of the nucleus is independent of EIF2C2. We tested the effect of ANT2 on nuclear morphology, reasoning that knockdown of ANT2 should cause nuclear irregularities similar to those observed following miR-29b blockade if the association with ANT2 was important for the observed effect of miR-29b. Indeed, knockdown of ANT2 by two different siRNAs resulted in nuclear morphological changes that are strikingly similar to those observed in cells treated with anti–miR-29b but distinct from cells treated with anti–miR-29a (Fig. 4A). Many multinucleate cells were observed, as well as cells with lobulated and ringed nuclear material. The cells with large, irregularly shaped nuclei accounted for ∼8% of all cells in culture following ANT2 knockdown (Fig. 4B), similar to what was observed in the anti–miR-29b–treated cells (Fig. 1, A and B). We also observed similar abnormalities in centrosomal organization in mitotic cells treated with anti–miR-29b or siRNA targeting ANT2 (Fig. S7). Knockdown of other components of the MMXD complex, with which ANT2 interacts, was previously reported to result in similar chromosomal and nuclear derangements (10Hinchcliffe E.H. Centrosomes and the art of mitotic spindle maintenance.Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2014; 313 (25376493): 179-21710.1016/B978-0-12-800177-6.00006-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis reveals that the ANT2 levels remained significantly lower in si-ANT2 treated cells 24 h after the second thymidine release (Fig. 4C), the time point when the cells in Fig. 5 (A and B) were isolated. This was accompanied by an increase in the abundance of miR-29b in HeLa cells (Fig. 4C).Figure 5.siANT2 blocks nuclear localization of miR-29b in early mitosis. In situ hybridization was used to detect miR-29b in si-Control (left) or siANT2 (right) transfected HeLa cells 24 h after release from the second thymidine block. This analysis revealed that knockdown of ANT2 with siRNA (right) prevented the nuclear uptake of miR-29b observed in both irregularly shaped and normal nuclei. This suggests that ANT2 is essential for the nuclear localization of miR-29b. The image from the ANT2 siRNA treatment group in the far left panel, also used in Fig. 4A, is shown here with an overlay of the signal from the miR-29b probe (green). This example demonstrates that suppression of ANT2 leads to both irregular nuclear morphology and concentration of miR-29b outside of the nucleus. The areas indicated by white squares in the upper panels are magnified in zoomed images in the lower panels to show cellular distribution of miR-29b. Scale bars indicate 50 μm in the upper row and 25 μm in the lower row.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We found that knockdown of ANT2 inhibited the nuclear uptake of miR-29b early in mitosis (Fig. 5). The ANT2 siRNA did not appear to attenuate the previously observed increase in miR-29b at this time point, but rather than being localized to the nucleus, the miR-29b is observed diffusely aggregated outside of the nuclear envelope following the ANT2 siRNA treatment. The amount of miR-29b appeared proportional to the amount of nuclear material within each cell, where cells with multiple and ringed nuclei exhibited miR-29b over a larger cellular area (Fig. 5). In addition to the large number of cells with abnormally shaped nuclei that result from miR-29b or ANT2 knockdown, there were several cells with nuclei that appeared normal in morphology. We performed a cell proliferation assay to determine whether cells that had apparently normal nuclei following anti–miR-29b treatment simply underwent normal mitosis, which would suggest that miR-29b only affected a fraction of the cell population functionally. The EdU reagent was added to the medium at the time of release from the second thymidine block, allowing incorporation of the regent into the DNA during the S phase. The cells were imaged 19 h later, allowing cells enough time to undergo at least one cycle of cell division. When compared with anti-scrambled miR transfected cells, anti–miR-29b transfected cells had universally higher EdU in each cell (Fig. 6) at the end of this period. These findings suggest that miR-29b suppression permits DNA synthesis but has inhibited cell cycle progression and cell division following EdU incorporation. Previous attempts to discover new miRNPs have relied on using known miRNA-induced silencing complex components such as argonaute 2 (AGO2 or EIF2C2) and trinucleotide repeat containing 6A (GW182 or TNRC6A) to pull out miRNP complexes (17Nelson P.T.

This approach allows identification of proteins that interact with known miRNPs. However, it does not identify miRNPs interacting with a specific miRNA or distinguish protein complexes that contain miRNAs from those that do not. The results of the present study suggest that miR-29b might regulate nuclear morphology through a unique interaction with ANT2, a protein important for microtubule organization. Predicted mRNA targets of miR-29b are shared with miR-29a because the isoforms have identical seed sequences. If miR-29b regulates nuclear morphology via the mRNA targeting mechanism, one would expect miR-29a and miR-29b to have similar effects, which is not the case. miR-29b has also been previously reported to be suppressed in several types of cancer, most notably in some forms of leukemia that include nuclear lobulation or “flower cell” morphology (20Pearson E.C.

ANT2 is a component of the MMXD complex (16Ito S. Tan L.J. Andoh D. Narita T. Seki M. Hirano Y. Narita K. Kuraoka I. Hiraoka Y. Tanaka K.

The MMXD complex is important for appropriate chromosomal segregation during mitosis. The MMXD component XPD is a known component of the microtubule organization complex (23Weber A. Chung H.J. Springer E. Heitzmann D. Warth R. The TFIIH subunit p89 (XPB) localizes to the centrosome during mitosis.Cell Oncol. 2010; 32 (20208140): 121-130PubMed Google Scholar) and was shown to interact directly with ANT2 (16Ito S. Tan L.J.

We found that early in mitosis ANT2 and miR-29b colocalized in the microtubule organization complex. Additionally, the lobulated nuclear morphology that we observed following the knockdown of either ANT2 or miR-29b was very similar to that observed by Ito et al. (16Ito S. Tan L.J. Andoh D. Narita T.

This suggests that miR-29b contributes importantly to normal chromosomal segregation through its interaction with ANT2. Further, our data suggest that ANT2 is necessary for the nuclear uptake of miR-29b. In the absence of miR-29b, abnormal cell division is observed. miR-29b suppression appears to functionally influence nearly all cells, resulting in abnormally shaped nuclei in some cells and the inability of the nuclei to divide in others. Together, the findings of the present study indicate that basal miR-29b contributes to normal nuclear morphology during mitosis, probably via unconventional mechanisms independent of seed region pairing and possibly involving molecular complexes that include ANT2 (Fig. S8) either through direct or indirect interaction. It would be important to investigate in future studies whether other miRNAs act through mechanisms independent of seed region pairing and how miRNAs interact with proteins other than argonautes. In the case of miR-29b and ANT2, the 3′ end sequence of miR-29b may be crucial because miR-29a and miR-29b sequences differ primarily at the 3′ end (Fig. S2). Although the present study focused on ANT2, other proteins uniquely interacting with miR-29b may contribute to additional unconventional actions of miR-29b (Table 1, Fig. S4, and supporting data set). For example, miR-29b interacted with several proteins important for gene transcription, suggesting possible effects of miR-29b on transcriptional regulation (6Kim D.H. Saetrom P. Snøve Jr, O. Rossi J.J. MicroRNA-directed transcriptional gene silencing in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Also of interest is that of the 135 proteins specifically interacting with the miR-29a duplex, over 25% were components of spliceosomes (supporting data set).

We aimed to explore the association of PCP density with melanoma incidence and mortality.All cases of cutaneous melanoma diagnosed in the United States from 2008-2012 and reported in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were analyzed in 2016. County-level primary care physician density was obtained from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We conducted multivariate linear regression using 1) average annual melanoma incidence or 2) average annual melanoma mortality by county as primary outcomes, adjusting for demographic confounders and dermatologist density. Cox proportional hazard regression was conducted using individual outcome data from SEER with the same covariates.Across 611 counties, 167,305 cases of melanoma were analyzed. Per 100,000 people, an additional 10 PCPs per county was associated with 1.62 additional cases of melanoma per year (95% CI 1.06-2.18, p<0.001). This increased incidence occurred disproportionally in early-stage melanoma (Stage 0: 0.69 cases (0.38-1.00), p<0.001; Stage I: 0.63 cases (0.37-0.89), p<0.001; Stage II: 0.11 cases (0.03-0.19), p = 0.005). There was no statistically significant association between PCP density and incidence of stage III or IV melanoma, or with melanoma-specific mortality. Survival analysis demonstrated elimination of 5-year post-diagnosis mortality risk in medically underserved counties after adjusting for stage.Higher densities of PCPs may be linked to increased diagnosis of early-stage melanoma without corresponding decreases in late-stage diagnoses or melanoma-associated mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2883234607,"Video-fluoroscopic analysis can provide important insights for the evaluation of outcome and functionality after total knee arthroplasty, allowing the in vivo assessment of tibiofemoral kinematics without soft tissue artefacts. To enable measurement of the knee throughout activities of daily living such as gait, robotic systems like the moving fluoroscope have been developed that follow the knee movement and maintain the joint in front of the image intensifier. Since it is unclear whether walking while being accompanied by moving fluoroscope affects normal gait, the objective of this study was to investigate its influence on gait characteristics in healthy subjects. In addition, the impact of the motors’ noise was analysed. By means of skin markers analysis (VICON MX system, Oxford Metrics Group, UK) and simultaneous measurement of ground reaction forces (Kistler force plates, Kistler, Switzerland), gait characteristics when walking with and without the moving fluoroscope as well as with and without ear protectors in combination with the moving fluoroscope, were obtained in young (n = 10, 24.5y ± 3.0y) and elderly (n = 9, 61.6y ± 5.3y) subjects during level gait and stair descent. Walking with the moving fluoroscope significantly decreased gait velocity in level gait and stair descent over the respective movement without the fluoroscope. Statistical analysis, including gait velocity as a covariate, resulted in no differences on the ground reaction force parameters. However, some kinematic parameters (ankle, knee and hip ranges of motion, minimal knee angle in late stance phase, maximal knee angles in stance and swing phase) seemed to be modified by the presence of the moving fluoroscope, but statistical comparison was limited due to velocity differences between the conditions. Wearing ear protectors to avoid the influence of motor sound during walking with the moving fluoroscope caused no significant difference. Walking with the moving fluoroscope has been shown to decrease gait velocity and small alterations in kinematic parameters were observed. Therefore, gait and movement alterations due to the moving fluoroscope cannot completely be excluded. However, based on the absence of differences in ground reaction force parameters (when adjusted for velocity within ANCOVA), as well as based on the comparable shape of the angular curves to the slow control condition, it can be concluded that changes in gait when walking with the moving fluoroscope are small, especially in comparison to natural slow walking. In order to allow assessment of joint replacement with the moving fluoroscope, including an understanding of the effects of joint pain, clinical analyses can only be compared to gait activities showing similarly reduced velocities. Importantly, the reduced gait speeds observed in this study are similar to those observed after total knee arthroplasty, suggesting that analyses in such subjects are appropriate. However, the moving fluoroscope would likely need to be optimized in order to detect natural gait characteristics at the higher gait velocities of healthy young subjects. The moving fluoroscope can be applied for comparisons between groups measured with the moving fluoroscope, but care should be taken when comparing data to subjects walking at self-selected speed without the moving fluoroscope."
https://openalex.org/W2883908724,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common endocrine cancer with a significantly increase of the incidence recently. Several cytokines, such as thyroid peroxidase (TPO), cluster of differentiation 56 (CD56), Galectin-3, mesothelial cell (MC), cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and BRAF (B-raf) were recommended to be tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for a definitive diagnosis, but were still limited in clinical use because of their relative lower sensitivity and specificity. MicroRNA (miRNA), as a new molecular biomarkers, however, has not been reported yet so far. To address this, hsa-miR-200a-5p, a miRNA, was selected and detected in PTC patients by in situ hybrization with benign thyroid tumor with papillary hyperplasia as a control, and the differential expression of hsa-miR-200a-5p between fresh PTC tissues and control was detected by qRT-PCR. Expressive levels of cytokines of TPO, CD56, Galectin-3, MC, CK19 and B-raf were also detected by immunohistochemistry. The correlation was analyzed by SPSS software using Spearman methods. As expected, the hsa-miR-200a-5p expressive level was significantly increased in PTC patients, compared to that of control, and was consistent with that of TPO, CD56, Galectin-3, MC, CK19 and B-raf. In addition, expression of hsa-miR-200a-5p showed negative correlation to that of TPO (rs = - 0.734; **: P < 0.01) and CD56 (rs = - 0.570; **: P < 0.01), but positive correlation to that of Galectin-3 (rs = 0.601; **: P < 0.01), MC (rs = 0.508; **: P < 0.01), CK19 (rs = 0.712; **: P < 0.01) and B-raf (rs = 0.378; **: P < 0.01). PTC and papillary benign thyroid papillary hyperplasia are difficult to distinguish in morphology, so requiring immunohistochemistry to further differentiate the diagnosis, however, for the existing clinical common diagnostic marker for immunohistochemistry, the sensitivity and accuracy are low, it is easy to miss diagnosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a rapid and sensitive molecular marker. So miR-200a-5p can be used to assist in the diagnosis of PTC at the molecular level, and as a biomarker, can be effectively used to distinguish between PTC and benign thyroid tumor with papillary hyperplasia."

In this study, we have developed anatomo-clinical atlases for the targeting of subthalamic and medial globus pallidus deep brain stimulation. The activated electrode coordinates of 42 patients implanted in the subthalamic nucleus and 29 patients in the medial globus pallidus were studied. The atlas was built using the representation of the volume of tissue theoretically activated by the stimulation. The UPDRS score was used to represent the motor outcome. The Stroop test was represented as well as semantic and phonemic fluencies. For the subthalamic nucleus, best motor outcomes were obtained when the supero-lateral part of the nucleus was stimulated whereas the semantic fluency was impaired in this same region. For the medial globus pallidus, best outcomes were obtained when the postero ventral part of the nucleus was stimulated whereas the phonemic fluency was impaired in this same region. There was no significant neuropsychological impairment. We have proposed new anatomo-clinical atlases to visualize the motor and neuropsychological consequences at 6 months of subthalamic nucleus and pallidal stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease."

To achieve this goal, a pilot clinical study was performed using PMNs from 17 patients with obesity and IR, and 17 lean controls without IR, which was validated in an additional smaller cohort (consisting of 10 patients and 10 controls). PMNs were isolated from peripheral blood and nuclear magnetic resonance was used to perform the metabolomic analysis. A total of 48 metabolites were quantified. The main metabolic change found in PMNs was a significant increase in 2-aminoisobutyric acid with a direct correlation with HOMA-IR (p<0.001), BMI (p<0.000001) and waist circumference (p<0.000001). By contrast, a decrease of 3-hydroxyisovalerate was observed with an inverse correlation with HOMA-IR (p = 0.001), BMI (p = 0.001) and waist circumference (p = 0.0001). Notably, the metabolic profile in plasma was different than that obtained in PMNs. In summary, our results suggest that the change in 3-hydroxyisovalerate and 2-aminoisobutyric is the key metabolic fingerprint in PMNs of obese subjects with IR. In addition, our methodology could be an easy and reliable tool for monitoring the effect of treatments in the setting of precision medicine."

The aim of this study is to investigate whether delirium patients with psychotic symptoms (PS) would have unique clinical characteristics and outcomes. A retrospective chart review was performed on the patients with delirium due to general medical conditions to assess clinical characteristics and outcomes. All patients were assessed by Delirium Rating Scale-revised-98 and classified as having PS when scored two or more on at least one of the psychotic symptom items (perceptual disturbances, delusions, and thought process abnormalities). Of 233 patients with delirium, 116 (49.8%) manifested PS. Patients with PS were younger, more likely to use antipsychotics to manage delirium, and had more hyperactive motor subtype than patients without PS. Logistic regression analysis showed that odds ratio of psychotic symptoms for having in-hospital mortality was 0.27 (95% CI = 0.08–0.94) after controlling age, sex, disease severity, comorbidity, number of medications, etiologies, motor subtypes, delirium severity and use of antipsychotics.

Recently we found in Curaçao a low incidence of HPV16 and 18 in cervical cancer compared to the standard world population. We aimed to determine HPV-prevalence, HPV-genotype distribution and associated risk-factors in women from Curaçao. Methods 5000 women aged 25–65 years were randomly selected from the national Population Register. HPV was detected by means of GP5+/6+PCR EIA and GP 5+/6+amplimers from HPV-positive samples were genotyped with a reverse hybridisation assay. We also collected personal data and data on risk-factors. Results 1075 women were enrolled in the study. Overall HPV-prevalence was 19.7%. Most frequent genotypes were HPV16 (2.3%), 35 (2.1%) and 52 (1.8%). Twenty-seven women detected with abnormal cytology (i.e.≥ASC-US) were referred for biopsy. In women with normal cytology (n = 1048), HPV-prevalence was 17.9% and the most common high-risk HPV (hrHPV)-types were HPV35 (2.0%), 18 (1.8%), 16 (1.5%) and 52 (1.5%). The highest HPV-prevalence (32.8%) was found in the age-group: 25–34 (n = 247). HPV positive women started sex at a younger age (p = 0.032). Conclusions HPV-prevalence in the overall population is high and HPV16 was the most common genotype followed by 35 and 18. In women with normal cytology HPV35 is the most common genotype followed by HPV18, 52 and 16. The high HPV-prevalence (32.8%) in women of 25–34 years argue for introduction of cervical cancer prevention strategies. HPV-type distribution found in Curaçao should be taken into account when considering the choice for prophylactic vaccination."

The promiscuity of esterases complicates assignment of their substrate preferences and biological functions. To identify universal factors controlling esterase substrate recognition, we designed a 32-member structure–activity relationship (SAR) library of fluorogenic ester substrates and used this library to systematically interrogate esterase preference for chain length, branching patterns, and polarity to differentiate common classes of esterase substrates. Two structurally homologous bacterial esterases were screened against this library, refining their previously broad overlapping substrate specificity. Vibrio cholerae esterase ybfF displayed a preference for γ-position thioethers and ethers, whereas Rv0045c from Mycobacterium tuberculosis displayed a preference for branched substrates with and without thioethers. We determined that this substrate differentiation was partially controlled by individual substrate selectivity residues Tyr-119 in ybfF and His-187 in Rv0045c; reciprocal substitution of these residues shifted each esterase's substrate preference. This work demonstrates that the selectivity of esterases is tuned based on transition state stabilization, identifies thioethers as an underutilized functional group for esterase substrates, and provides a rapid method for differentiating structural isozymes.

When more items are to be remembered, they are forgotten faster, potentially suggesting that stronger memories are forgotten less rapidly. Here we tested this prediction with three experiments that assessed the influence of memory strength on the rate of forgetting of visual information without manipulating the number of items. Forgetting rate was assessed by comparing the accuracy of reports in a delayed-estimation task following relatively short and long retention intervals. In the first experiment, we compared the forgetting rate of items that were directly fixated, to items that were not. In Experiments 2 and 3 we manipulated memory strength by extending the exposure time of one item in the memory array. As expected, direct fixation and longer exposure led to better accuracy of reports, reflecting stronger memory. However, in all three experiments, we did not find evidence that increased memory strength moderated the forgetting rate."

Various physiological, proteomic and bioinformatic studies were carried out to examine the effect of chronic hypobaric hypoxia on kidney. Our data demonstrated mild to moderate degenerative tubular changes, altered renal function, injury biomarkers and systolic blood pressure with increase in duration of hypobaric hypoxia exposure. Renal proteomic analysis showed 38 differential expressed spots, out of which 25 spots were down regulated and 13 were up regulated in 7 dayhypobarichypoxic exposure group of rats as compared to normoxia control. Identified proteins were involved in specific molecular changes pertinent to endogenous redox pathways, cellular integrity and energy metabolism. The study provides an empirical evidence of renal homeostasis under hypobaric hypoxia by investigating both physiological and proteomics changes. The identification of explicit key proteins provides a valuable clue about redox signalling mediated renal damage under hypobaric hypoxia."

The LBW fetuses exhibited the lowest BW and crude fat, C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:2n6c, and MUFA concentrations at days 75 and 110 of gestation. They also exhibited lower Tyr concentration at day 45 of gestation and lower Glu concentration at day 75 of gestation than HBW fetuses. These findings suggest that LBW fetuses exhibit lower amounts of crude fat and several FAs during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect adaptability, growth, and development."

Mechanical ventilation of preterm lambs causes increases in EGFR and EGFR ligand mRNA in the lung. Abnormal EGFR signaling may contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.Inhibition of EGFR signaling will decrease airway epithelial cell proliferation and lung inflammation caused by mechanical ventilation in preterm, fetal sheep.Following exposure of the fetal head and chest at 123±1 day gestational age and with placental circulation intact, fetal lambs (n = 4-6/group) were randomized to either: 1) Gefitinib 15 mg IV and 1 mg intra-tracheal or 2) saline IV and IT. Lambs were further assigned to 15 minutes of either: a) Injurious mechanical ventilation (MV) or b) Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) 5 cmH2O. After the 15 minute intervention, the animals were returned to the uterus and delivered after i) 6 or ii) 24 hours in utero.MV caused lung injury and inflammation, increased lung mRNA for cytokines and EGFR ligands, caused airway epithelial cell proliferation, and decreased airway epithelial phosphorylated ERK1/2. Responses to MV were unchanged by Gefitinib. Gefitinib altered expression of EGFR mRNA in the lung and liver of both CPAP and MV animals. Gefitinib decreased the liver SAA3 mRNA response to MV at 6 hours. There were no differences in markers of lung injury or inflammation between CPAP animals receiving Gefitinib or saline.Inhibition of the EGFR pathway did not alter acute lung inflammation or injury from mechanical ventilation in preterm sheep."
https://openalex.org/W2883143160,"Craniosynostosis is caused by premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures, restricting skull, brain and face growth. Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis could disturb the proportions of face. Although morphometric diameters of nasal cavity in healthy children are already known, they have not been established yet in children with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. The aim our study was to check whether diameters of bone structures of nasal cavity in children with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis measured in CT are within normal range. 249 children aged 0-36 months (96 with clinical diagnosis of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis and 153 in control group) were included into the study. The following diameters were measured on head CT scans: anterior bony width (ABW), bony choanal aperture width (BCAW), right and left posterior bony width (between bone sidewall and nasal cavity septum-RPBW and LPBW). The study group has been divided into 4 categories, depending on child's age. The dimensions measured between bone structures of nasal cavity were statistically significantly lower in comparison to the control group. They did not depend on the sex for ABW, nor on age in groups 7-12 months and < 2 years for BCAW, RPBW and LPBW. The measured dimensions increased with age. In children with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis the diameter of pyriform aperture and bony choanal aperture were lower than in controls, what may be described as fronto-orbital anomalies. Morphometric measurements of anthropometric indicators on CT scans could be used as standards in the clinical identification of craniosynostosis type and may help in planning surgical procedures, particularly in the facial skeleton in children."
https://openalex.org/W2883840488,"Ribosomes are encoded by many copies of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) packed into the nucleolus. High rates of transcription combined with highly repetitive sequences render rDNA loci particularly vulnerable to genomic instability, a proposed underlying cause of cellular senescence. The molecular mechanisms that maintain rDNA stability have remained unclear. A new paper elucidates a sirtuin-dependent mechanism that protects rDNA loci from genomic instability and prevents cellular senescence via heterochromatin silencing mediated by the chromatin remodeler SNF2H. This finding extends our understanding of chromatin dynamics within rDNA regions and offers new mechanistic insights into aging-related pathologies associated with genomic instability."
https://openalex.org/W2884263920,"In modern agricultural production, maize is the most successful crop utilizing heterosis. 712C-ms22 is an important male sterile material in maize. In this study, we performed transcriptome sequencing analysis of the V10 stage of male inflorescence. Through this analysis, 27.63 million raw reads were obtained, and trimming of the raw data revealed 26.63 million clean reads, with an average match rate of 94.64%. Using Tophat software, we matched these clean reads to the maize reference genome. The abundance of 39,622 genes was measured, and 35,399 genes remained after filtering out the non-expressed genes across all the samples. These genes were classified into 19 categories by clusters of orthologous groups of protein annotation. Transcriptome sequencing analysis of the male sterile and fertile 712C-ms22 maize revealed some key DEGs that may be related to metabolic pathways. qRT-PCR analysis validated the gene expression patterns identified by RNA-seq. This analysis revealed some of the essential genes responsible for pollen development and for pollen tube elongation. Our findings provide useful markers of male sterility and new insights into the global mechanisms mediating male sterility in maize."
https://openalex.org/W2883937228,"In adipose tissue, resistance to insulin's ability to increase glucose uptake can be induced by multiple factors, including obesity. Impaired insulin action may take place at different spatial loci at the cellular or subcellular level. To begin to understand the spatial response to insulin in human subcutaneous adipose tissue (hSAT), we developed a quantitative imaging method for activation of a major signaling node in the glucoregulatory insulin signaling pathway. After treatment with insulin or control media, biopsied tissues were immunostained for Akt phosphorylation at Thr-308/9 (pAkt) and then imaged by confocal fluorescence microscopy automated to collect a large grid of resolution fields. In hSAT from 40 men and women with obesity, substantial heterogeneity of pAkt densities in adipocyte membranes were quantified in each image mosaic using a spatial unit of at least twice the size of the point spread function. Statistical analysis of the distribution of pAkt spatial units was best fit as the weighted sum of two separate distributions, corresponding to either a low or pAkt density. A high pAkt metric was calculated from the fraction of pAkt distributed units over the total units. Importantly, upon insulin stimulation, tissues from the same biopsy showed either a minimal or a substantial change in the pAkt fraction. Further supporting a two-state response to insulin stimulation, subjects with similar insulin sensitivity indices are also segregated into either of two clusters identified by the amount of membrane-localized pAkt."
https://openalex.org/W2883803774,"The advent of whole-genome sequencing promised, among other things, that variants affecting regulatory regions of the genome could be identified to provide insight into inherited pathologies or the impact of de novo mutations. These gains are accruing but still lag expectations. While whole-genome sequences accumulate in both academic and clinical settings, one inescapable limitation is that identifying functional regulatory sequences—be they enhancers, promoters, UTRs—that control specific genes remains difficult at the level of basic research. There is a growing understanding of how sequence elements contribute to genome organization and gene regulation (Hnisz et al., 2016Hnisz D. Day D.S. Young R.A. Insulated neighborhoods: structural and functional units of mammalian gene control.Cell. 2016; 167: 1188-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, no experimental or computation approach can, as yet, consistently and reliably predict or identify the cis-regulatory elements that exert transcriptional control over a gene of interest. The challenge in human genetics is then 2-fold: amass the numbers of individual sequences required to be able to confidently identify candidate cis-regulatory variants (as distinct from noise) and then find some way to prioritize those sequences in a functional context. Phylogenetic comparisons between organisms can be helpful in breaking this log-jam. However, in some cases for human genetics, the important sequences are those that are uniquely human. Yet this kind of comparison between human sequences and those from great apes has been hampered by variability in the reference sequences of the latter. Limitations due to uneven sequence coverage and quality has been exacerbated by the use of human sequences to aid in genome alignments and gene calling. In effect, elements of the great ape sequences might look more human than they should because of a technical bias. Aiming to address this issue, recent work from Evan Eichler’s group (Kronenberg et al., 2018Kronenberg Z.N. Fiddes I.T. Gordon D. Murali S. Cantsilieris S. Meyerson O.S. Underwood J.G. Nelson B.J. Chaisson M.J.P. Dougherty M.L. et al.High-resolution comparative analysis of great ape genomes.Science. 2018; 360: eaar6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) reports new sequences and assemblies of chimpanzee and orangutan genomes without use of a human framework. This study, in concert with their earlier work on the gorilla genome (Gordon et al., 2016Gordon D. Huddleston J. Chaisson M.J.P. Hill C.M. Kronenberg Z.N. Munson K.M. Malig M. Raja A. Fiddes I. Hillier L.W. et al.Long-read sequence assembly of the gorilla genome.Science. 2016; 352: aae0344Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), enables researchers to look at key differences among these primates. The authors leveraged long-read sequencing of iPSCs to develop new gene models and cerebral organoids as a surrogate to look more closely at chimp-human comparisons during brain development. They find that structural variations (SVs) affect putative regulatory regions, including superenhancers, and are more likely to affect gene expression than expected. The RNAs produced reflect these differences as, for example, humans and chimps show significant differences in key neuronal cell types that track with human-specific SVs. These newly identified human-specific variants are an invitation to the broader community to tackle how they function and whether they are tied to pathologies or uniquely human biology. How variants affecting regulatory sequences contribute to disease phenotypes is a long-standing question. In different disease contexts, progress has been slowed by a lack of sufficient sequence numbers to confidently pull rare variants out of the background noise. Single-nucleotide variants pose the greatest challenge, but structural variants are becoming accessible. New work from Jonathan Sebat and colleagues (Brandler et al., 2018Brandler W.M. Antaki D. Gujral M. Kleiber M.L. Whitney J. Maile M.S. Hong O. Chapman T.R. Tan S. Tandon P. et al.Paternally inherited cis-regulatory structural variants are associated with autism.Science. 2018; 360: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) focuses on identifying cis-regulatory structural variants in a large-scale autism cohort. Their approach to assessing regulatory elements that might be significant for the disorder relies on constraints derived from patterns in the general population. Previous work characterized genes for their tolerance or intolerance to loss-of-function (LOF) mutations (Samocha et al., 2014Samocha K.E. Robinson E.B. Sanders S.J. Stevens C. Sabo A. McGrath L.M. Kosmicki J.A. Rehnström K. Mallick S. Kirtby A. Wall D.P. et al.A framework for the interpretation of de novo mutation in human disease.Nat. Genet. 2014; 46: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) and found that autism cases tend to carry coding mutations in the top 1,000 genes that are intolerant to loss-of-function mutation in a general population from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). Using this as a point of comparison, sequences that show negative selection for SVs in the general population but harbor SVs in individuals in the new cohort can be prioritized. In examining the sequences, the authors subdivided regions into “cis regulatory” and “coding and noncoding,” which could then be overlaid with information about intolerance to LOF. Unexpectedly, they report selective transmission of paternal cis regulatory (CRE) SVs in intolerant genes. As earlier studies pointed to maternal contributions to inherited variants, the notion that inherited CRE structural variants have a distinct paternal bias necessitates new models for thinking about autism spectrum disorder. One way to get a leg up on understanding how SVs in regulatory sequences affect functional gene expression is start with a known pool of regulatory sequences. Matthew Hurles and his colleagues took this approach when looking at individuals with undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders (Short et al., 2018Short P.J. McRae J.F. Gallone G. Sifrim A. Won H. Geschwind D.H. Wright C.F. Firth H.V. FitzPatrick D.R. Barrett J.C. Hurles M.E. De novo mutations in regulatory elements in neurodevelopmental disorders.Nature. 2018; 555: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Over 50% of the individuals in the Deciphering Developmental Disorders study lack classifiable variants in a protein-coding gene. To look for contributing cis-regulatory sequences, the study focuses on evolutionarily conserved non-coding elements (CNEs), experimentally validated enhancers, and putative heart-specific enhancers as cardiovascular disease was the most frequent non-neurological clinical phenotype detected in individuals. De novo mutations in CNEs were correlated with DNase hypersensitivity sites across tissues to identify candidates with a higher likelihood of being functional. These show a degree of enrichment for de novo mutations, whereas validated enhancers did not, suggesting that these sequences could be plumbed for distinct regulatory contributions. The study then focused on analysis of expression in fetal brain where there was a strong enrichment of de novo mutations. Although the mutations were broadly associated with genes linked to early prenatal brain development rather than developmental disorders by Hi-C, there was no basis to causally link to specific regulatory variants. Interestingly, the study reports some incidence of recurrent mutation of certain CNEs and conserved enhancers, providing a rationale for further exploration of these sequences. These three studies make significant steps in both identifying candidate regulatory regions and prioritizing structural variants in regulatory sequences. Both kinds of information are necessary to understand whether variants in cis-regulatory elements contribute broadly to human genetic disease. Both the neurodevelopment and autism studies provide some insight on this score. For the neurodevelopment cohort, the effect size seems quite modest with 0.15% of the variants forecast as penetrant and potentially pathological. Similarly, inherited cis-regulatory SVs are modeled in 0.77% of cases in the autism study. In each case, these values fall below what is observed for coding variants, calling into question the significance of their contributions. However, gauging the functional significance of these variants will ultimately require multiple technologies to marry sequencing information and linkage of regulatory sequences to specific genes. What may seem to be a minor-league player based on stats, may turn out to be a major-league contributor when put on the field—for humans, the suite of variants, both inherited and de novo, that make each individual truly individual."
https://openalex.org/W2883894585,"I needed a change. Just a few years earlier, I stood at the edge of the swamp under a massive hollow cypress tree reading Winnie-the-Pooh to a group of 5- and 6-year-olds. As a naturalist at a state park, my goal was to introduce these children to the nature found in their own backyard. I played a tape of owl calls to accompany the story. Just then, an owl swooped down over our heads, startling and delighting us. “I can't believe I'm actually getting paid to have this much fun!” I thought to myself. But over time, my job changed. Sitting at my desk, staring at environmental impact reports and grant applications on my computer screen, I began to think, “They cannot pay me enough to do this job.” It was another turning point in the winding road that led me, at age 66, to earn a Ph.D.

> “I was 60 years old. … But I wanted to follow my new passion.” 

My first career had been audiology—a pragmatic choice based on job opportunities in a rural area, and one that allowed me to work part time while tending my growing family. But when my children grew up and left home, I found myself longing to be outside, not in a soundproof room in the hospital basement.

I began attending ornithology classes at the local university, hoping that might lead me to new career prospects. I also went to see a career counselor, offered as part of a university program for nontraditional students. “What gave you pleasure as a child?” the counselor asked. I thought for a while before responding, “Playing outside in the woods.”

Our discussion eventually led to a second master's degree, this one in zoology, and the job as a naturalist at a state park. It was an entry-level position. I was 44 years old. And I was delighted to once again experience the joy of being outdoors that I had felt as a child.

But as I climbed the career ladder at my state's Department of Natural Resources, from naturalist to grant compliance officer to managing environmental reviews of publicly funded conservation projects, my time in the field diminished and finally disappeared. I was chained to a computer screen. In the back of my mind, the career counselor's question smoldered. “What gave you pleasure as a child?”

As my discontent grew, life went on. At a dinner party, my friends and I discussed the perfect retirement. We agreed that, if money were not an issue, we would each purchase a home in a different part of the world and rotate among them. Shortly thereafter, an opportunity presented itself: a 4-month sabbatical at a university in the Netherlands as part of a field research project. It wasn't quite the house-share plan, but it had the appeal of being someplace new.

I found that field research allowed me to play in the woods again, but with a new purpose. I was able to combine my childhood delight in nature with the intellectual stimulation that comes with figuring things out—pleasures that had become all too rare in my job.

At the end of my stay, I was invited to participate in the “sandwich” Ph.D. program, in which students do research in their home country while receiving support and instruction in the Netherlands. I was 60 years old. I didn't think that earning a Ph.D. would further my career. But I wanted to follow my new passion.

I figured that I could work full time at my day job in the state government and conduct my research during evenings and weekends. Still, my colleagues raised their eyebrows. “What do you intend to do with a Ph.D.?” they asked. “It is all about the journey,” I responded.

I successfully defended my dissertation 6 years later, 3 years after retiring from my government position.

My career path has taken some sharp zigs and zags over my 40 years in the workforce. And each decision I made was the right one for me at the time. But when they were no longer right, I changed direction. No career decision has to be final. As one of my favorite authors, Ursula K. Le Guin, wrote, “It is good to have an end to journey towards, but it is the journey that matters in the end.”
