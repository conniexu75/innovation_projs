https://openalex.org/W2124070575,"Despite continued forest conversion and degradation, forest cover is increasing in countries across the globe. New forests are regenerating on former agricultural land, and forest plantations are being established for commercial and restoration purposes. Plantations and restored forests can improve ecosystem services and enhance biodiversity conservation, but will not match the composition and structure of the original forest cover. Approaches to restoring forest ecosystems depend strongly on levels of forest and soil degradation, residual vegetation, and desired restoration outcomes. Opportunities abound to combine ambitious forest restoration and regeneration goals with sustainable rural livelihoods and community participation. New forests will require adaptive management as dynamic, resilient systems that can withstand stresses of climate change, habitat fragmentation, and other anthropogenic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2138889935,"Forests currently absorb billions of tons of CO 2 globally every year, an economic subsidy worth hundreds of billions of dollars if an equivalent sink had to be created in other ways. Concerns about the permanency of forest carbon stocks, difficulties in quantifying stock changes, and the threat of environmental and socioeconomic impacts of large-scale reforestation programs have limited the uptake of forestry activities in climate policies. With political will and the involvement of tropical regions, forests can contribute to climate change protection through carbon sequestration as well as offering economic, environmental, and sociocultural benefits. A key opportunity in tropical regions is the reduction of carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1997477098,"Protein dynamics are essential for protein function, and yet it has been challenging to access the underlying atomic motions in solution on nanosecond-to-microsecond time scales. We present a structural ensemble of ubiquitin, refined against residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), comprising solution dynamics up to microseconds. The ensemble covers the complete structural heterogeneity observed in 46 ubiquitin crystal structures, most of which are complexes with other proteins. Conformational selection, rather than induced-fit motion, thus suffices to explain the molecular recognition dynamics of ubiquitin. Marked correlations are seen between the flexibility of the ensemble and contacts formed in ubiquitin complexes. A large part of the solution dynamics is concentrated in one concerted mode, which accounts for most of ubiquitin's molecular recognition heterogeneity and ensures a low entropic complex formation cost."

We found that the transcription factor XBP1, a key regulator of the unfolded protein response, is required for the unrelated function of normal fatty acid synthesis in the liver. XBP1 protein expression in mice was elevated after feeding carbohydrates and corresponded with the induction of critical genes involved in fatty acid synthesis. Inducible, selective deletion of XBP1 in the liver resulted in marked hypocholesterolemia and hypotriglyceridemia, secondary to a decreased production of lipids from the liver. This phenotype was not accompanied by hepatic steatosis or compromise in protein secretory function. The identification of XBP1 as a regulator of lipogenesis has important implications for human dyslipidemias."
https://openalex.org/W2067799130,"Process-specific training can improve performance on untrained tasks, but the magnitude of gain is variable and often there is no transfer at all. We demonstrate transfer to a 3-back test of working memory after 5 weeks of training in updating. The transfer effect was based on a joint training-related activity increase for the criterion (letter memory) and transfer tasks in a striatal region that also was recruited pretraining. No transfer was observed to a task that did not engage updating and striatal regions, and age-related striatal changes imposed constraints on transfer. These findings indicate that transfer can occur if the criterion and transfer tasks engage specific overlapping processing components and brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W2168785486,"Differentiation and secondary metabolism are correlated processes in fungi that respond to light. In Aspergillus nidulans , light inhibits sexual reproduction as well as secondary metabolism. We identified the heterotrimeric velvet complex VelB/VeA/LaeA connecting light-responding developmental regulation and control of secondary metabolism. VeA, which is primarily expressed in the dark, physically interacts with VelB, which is expressed during sexual development. VeA bridges VelB to the nuclear master regulator of secondary metabolism, LaeA. Deletion of either velB or veA results in defects in both sexual fruiting-body formation and the production of secondary metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W2132839236,"Molecular structure is usually determined by measuring the diffraction pattern the molecule impresses on x-rays or electrons. We used a laser field to extract electrons from the molecule itself, accelerate them, and in some cases force them to recollide with and diffract from the parent ion, all within a fraction of a laser period. Here, we show that the momentum distribution of the extracted electron carries the fingerprint of the highest occupied molecular orbital, whereas the elastically scattered electrons reveal the position of the nuclear components of the molecule. Thus, in one comprehensive technology, the photoelectrons give detailed information about the electronic orbital and the position of the nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W2005197716,"The charge transport mechanism of a wire can be revealed by how its electrical resistance varies with length. We have measured the resistance and current-voltage characteristics of conjugated molecular wires ranging in length from 1 to 7 nanometers, connected between metal electrodes. We observe the theoretically predicted change in direct-current transport from tunneling to hopping as a function of systematically controlled wire length. We also demonstrate that site-specific disruption of conjugation in the wires greatly increases resistance in the hopping regime but has only a small effect in the tunneling regime. These nanoscale transport measurements elucidate the role of molecular length and bond architecture on molecular conductivity and open opportunities for greater understanding of electrical transport in conjugated polymer films."
https://openalex.org/W2141513161,"Major features of contemporary forest governance include decentralization of forest management, logging concessions in publicly owned commercially valuable forests, and timber certification, primarily in temperate forests. Although a majority of forests continue to be owned formally by governments, the effectiveness of forest governance is increasingly independent of formal ownership. Growing and competing demands for food, biofuels, timber, and environmental services will pose severe challenges to effective forest governance in the future, especially in conjunction with the direct and indirect impacts of climate change. A greater role for community and market actors in forest governance and deeper attention to the factors that lead to effective governance, beyond ownership patterns, is necessary to address future forest governance challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2028877728,"Recent climate talks in Bali have made progress toward action on deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries, within the anticipated post-Kyoto emissions reduction agreements. As a result of such action, many forests will be better protected, but some land-use change will be displaced to other locations. The demonstration phase launched at Bali offers an opportunity to examine potential outcomes for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Research will be needed into selection of priority areas for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation to deliver multiple benefits, on-the-ground methods to best ensure these benefits, and minimization of displaced land-use change into nontarget countries and ecosystems, including through revised conservation investments."
https://openalex.org/W2074102438,"Atherosclerosis is now recognized as an inflammatory disease involving the vascular wall. Recent results indicate that acute inflammation does not simply passively resolve as previously assumed but is actively terminated by a homeostatic process that is governed by specific lipid-derived mediators initiated by lipoxygenases. Experiments with animals and humans support a proinflammatory role for the 5-lipoxygenase system. In contrast, results from animal experiments show a range of responses with the 12/15-lipoxygenase pathways in atherosclerosis. To date, the only two clinical epidemiology human studies both support an antiatherogenic role for 12/15-lipoxygenase downstream actions. We tested the hypothesis that atherosclerosis results from a failure in the resolution of local inflammation by analyzing apolipoprotein E-deficient mice with 1) global leukocyte 12/15-lipoxygenase deficiency, 2) normal enzyme expression, or 3) macrophage-specific 12/15-lipoxygenase overexpression. Results from these indicate that 12/15-lipoxygenase expression protects mice against atherosclerosis via its role in the local biosynthesis of lipid mediators, including lipoxin A(4), resolvin D1, and protectin D1. These mediators exert potent agonist actions on macrophages and vascular endothelial cells that can control the magnitude of the local inflammatory response. Taken together, these findings suggest that a failure of local endogenous resolution mechanisms may underlie the unremitting inflammation that fuels atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2070886035,"In the past several decades, the tropospheric westerly winds in the Southern Hemisphere have been observed to accelerate on the poleward side of the surface wind maximum. This has been attributed to the combined anthropogenic effects of increasing greenhouse gases and decreasing stratospheric ozone and is predicted to continue by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change/Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC/AR4) models. In this paper, the predictions of the Chemistry-Climate Model Validation (CCMVal) models are examined: Unlike the AR4 models, the CCMVal models have a fully interactive stratospheric chemistry. Owing to the expected disappearance of the ozone hole in the first half of the 21st century, the CCMVal models predict that the tropospheric westerlies in Southern Hemisphere summer will be decelerated, on the poleward side, in contrast with the prediction of most IPCC/AR4 models."
https://openalex.org/W2085749928,"Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) have shown that forest dynamics could dramatically alter the response of the global climate system to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide over the next century. But there is little agreement between different DGVMs, making forest dynamics one of the greatest sources of uncertainty in predicting future climate. DGVM predictions could be strengthened by integrating the ecological realities of biodiversity and height-structured competition for light, facilitated by recent advances in the mathematics of forest modeling, ecological understanding of diverse forest communities, and the availability of forest inventory data."
https://openalex.org/W1990022877,"The generation of reactive oxygen species is a central feature of inflammation that results in the oxidation of host phospholipids. Oxidized phospholipids, such as 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (OxPAPC), have been shown to inhibit signaling induced by bacterial lipopeptide or lipopolysac-charide (LPS), yet the mechanisms responsible for the inhibition of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling by OxPAPC remain incompletely understood. Here, we examined the mechanisms by which OxPAPC inhibits TLR signaling induced by diverse ligands in macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and epithelial cells. OxPAPC inhibited tumor necrosis factor-α production, IκBα degradation, p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and NF-κB-dependent reporter activation induced by stimulants of TLR2 and TLR4 (Pam3CSK4 and LPS) but not by stimulants of other TLRs (poly(I·C), flagellin, loxoribine, single-stranded RNA, or CpG DNA) in macrophages and HEK-293 cells transfected with respective TLRs and significantly reduced inflammatory responses in mice injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally with Pam3CSK4. Serum proteins, including CD14 and LPS-binding protein, were identified as key targets for the specificity of TLR inhibition as supplementation with excess serum or recombinant CD14 or LBP reversed TLR2 inhibition by OxPAPC, whereas serum accessory proteins or expression of membrane CD14 potentiated signaling via TLR2 and TLR4 but not other TLRs. Binding experiments and functional assays identified MD2 as a novel additional target of OxPAPC inhibition of LPS signaling. Synthetic phospholipid oxidation products 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleryl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaryl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine inhibited TLR2 signaling from ∼30 μm. Taken together, these results suggest that oxidized phospholipid-mediated inhibition of TLR signaling occurs mainly by competitive interaction with accessory proteins that interact directly with bacterial lipids to promote signaling via TLR2 or TLR4.

The generation of reactive oxygen species by phagocytes is central to the antimicrobial effectiveness of the inflammatory response. Activated polymorphonuclear cells in particular express enzymes such as NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase, which together generate a range of oxidants, including superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorous acid, each of which may be released from these cells to cause oxidative damage not only to invading microorganisms but also to host molecules in surrounding tissues (1Zhang R.

Oxidation of PAPC leads to the formation of a mixture of products, ranging from epoxyisoprostanes to truncated chain derivatives that are collectively termed OxPAPC, which is a widely used model for the investigation of oxidized phospholipid (OxPL) function (10Leitinger N.

To date, much research has focused on the potential of OxPLs to augment inflammatory events by mechanisms such as the up-regulation of IL-8 or promotion of monocyte binding to endothelial cells, particularly in the context of the chronic inflammatory processes of atherosclerosis (6Leitinger N. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 13Berliner J. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2002; 38: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, OxPLs have also been shown to possess diverse anti-inflammatory properties. For example, OxPAPC was shown to induce peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α-dependent signaling, expression of heme oxygenase-1 and MAP kinase phosphatase-1, each of which has established antiinflammatory properties (14Lee H. Shi W. Tontonoz P. Wang S. Subbanagounder G. Hedrick C.C. Hama S. Borromeo C. Evans R.M. Berliner J.A. Nagy L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 15Kronke G.

More directly, it was shown that OxPAPC potently inhibits inflammation-related tissue damage and death caused by endotoxemia in mice (17Bochkov V.N. Kadl A. Huber J. Gruber F. Binder B.R. Leitinger N. Nature. 2002; 419: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). As a result, it has been proposed that host recognition of OxPLs may represent an endogenous feedback mechanism that serves to limit the potential damage caused by inflammation-induced oxidants (17Bochkov V.N. Kadl A. Huber J. Gruber F. Binder B.R. Leitinger N. Nature. 2002; 419: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Such feedback mechanisms are now understood to play key roles in the resolution of inflammation, a process that is increasingly viewed as active and well orchestrated. Examination of resolving exudates has identified a range of lipid-based mediators of resolution, such as the lipoxins and resolvins, which each promote resolution (18Perretti M. Chiang N. La M. Fierro I.M. Marullo S. Getting S.J. Solito E. Serhan C.N. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 19Arita M. Bianchini F. Aliberti J. Sher A. Chiang N. Hong S. Yang R. Petasis N.A. Serhan C.N. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). These agents are created largely by the enzymatic oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids via the action of cyclooxygenase-2 and lipoxygenases (20Serhan C.N. Brain S.D. Buckley C.D. Gilroy D.W. Haslett C. O'Neill L.A.J. Perretti M. Rossi A.G. Wallace J.L. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). However, despite the recent progress in understanding the roles for enzymatically oxidized lipids in resolution, the potential role of oxidized lipids created by nonenzymatic routes, such as by reactive oxygen species-mediated peroxidation, has received comparatively little attention. Because stimulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling has been shown to play a central role in the induction of inflammation, oxidant release, and tissue damage in many different disease models (21Abdollahi-Roodsaz S. Joosten L.A. Roelofs M.F. Radstake T.R. Matera G. Popa C. van der Meer J.W. Netea M.G. van den Berg W.B. Arthritis Rheum. 2007; 56: 2957-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 22Liaudet L.

The mechanisms by which OxPAPC inhibits LPS signaling are currently under debate, and numerous potential models have been put forward. For example, it has been suggested that the generation of cAMP in response to products of phospholipid oxidation could inhibit NF-κB-induced gene transcription stimulated by LPS in endothelial cells (10Leitinger N. Tyner T.R. Oslund L. Rizza C. Subbanagounder G. Lee H. Shih P.T. Mackman N. Tigyi G. Territo M.C. Berliner J.A. Vora D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12010-12015Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that OxPLs can bind to CD14 and LPS-binding protein (LBP), both of which serve to enhance cellular sensitivity to LPS (17Bochkov V.N. Kadl A. Huber J. Gruber F. Binder B.R. Leitinger N. Nature. 2002; 419: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been suggested that the capacity of OxPLs to deplete cellular cholesterol and thereby disrupt lipid-rafts or caveolae could also contribute to TLR inhibition, on the assumption that recruitment of TLRs to rafts may be a requirement for effective TLR-signaling (11Walton K.A. Cole A.L. Yeh M. Subbanagounder G. Krutzik S.R. Modlin R.L. Lucas R.M. Nakai J. Smart E.J. Vora D.K. Berliner J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Finally, using synthetic derivatives of OxPLs, it was shown that the production of ceramide via neutral sphingomyelinase activation may also contribute to inhibition of LPS signaling and that phospholipid oxidation products containing α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids are among the most efficient inhibitors of LPS signaling deriving from PAPC oxidation (27Walton K.A.

However, despite this progress, very little has been learned about the mechanisms by which OxPLs may inhibit signaling induced by other TLRs. Although it was shown that treatment of macrophages with OxPAPC reduces the secretion of IL-8 in response to the TLR2 ligand Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipoprotein (11Walton K.A. Cole A.L. Yeh M. Subbanagounder G. Krutzik S.R. Modlin R.L. Lucas R.M. Nakai J. Smart E.J. Vora D.K. Berliner J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and that high concentrations of OxPAPC may reduce the amount of TNF-α secreted in response to the TLR9 agonist CpG DNA (24Ma Z. Li J. Yang L. Mu Y. Xie W. Pitt B. Li S. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2004; 286: 808-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), no studies have yet addressed the mechanisms by which these or other TLRs beyond TLR4 are inhibited by OxPLs. We, therefore, aimed to establish the potential of OxPLs to inhibit signaling induced by other TLRs and to investigate the mechanisms responsible for these effects. Reagents—PAPC, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD), nystatin, MTT, DMEM, RPMI, and fetal calf serum were purchased from Sigma. Escherichia coli R1 LPS was a kind gift of Professor Ian Poxton (University of Edinburgh). TLR ligands Pam3CSK4, poly(I·C), Bacillus subtilis flagellin, loxoribine, ssRNA, and endotoxin-free CpG DNA were from Invivogen. Recombinant soluble CD14 was from R&D Systems. LBP purified from human plasma was obtained from Hycult Biotechnology. Synthetic 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleryl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POVPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaryl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PGPC) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Endotoxin contamination of reagents was ruled out by the use of limulus amebocyte lysate assays (Quadratech) or challenge of TLR4-transfected HEK-293 cells. OxPAPC was prepared by air oxidation of native PAPC as described previously (4Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Horkko S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13597-13607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg of PAPC in chloroform was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen in a glass tube. The lipid film was then exposed to air in darkness for 72 h before resuspension to 2 mg/ml in chloroform and stored under nitrogen at -80 °C. The extent of oxidation of PAPC was monitored by electrospray mass spectrometry and showed a similar profile to that described previously (4Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Horkko S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol.

Aliquots of stock OxPAPC were dried under nitrogen in Eppendorf tubes immediately before use and vortexed into prewarmed medium (37 °C) for 30 s before the addition to cells. Cells and Media—The human monocytic THP-1 cell-line (ECACC 88081201) was cultured in RPMI, 10% FCS. Before challenge in all experiments, THP-1 cells were treated with 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 72 h to allow differentiation to adherent macrophages. Murine J774A.1 macrophages (ECACC 91051511) were cultured in DMEM, 10% FCS. Human epithelial HEK-293 cells (ECACC 85120602) and the transformed human arterial smooth muscle (HASMC) cell line (ACBRI #443, Applied Cell Biology Research Institute, Kirkland, WA) were maintained in DMEM, 10% FCS. Challenge of Cells with Pathogen-associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs)—THP-1 macrophages were challenged with medium alone (DMEM, 1% FCS) or 1–100 ng/ml Pam3CSK4, or 0.1–10 ng/ml LPS in the presence or absence of 30 μg/ml OxPAPC. J774A.1 macrophages were challenged with medium alone or 250–1000 ng/ml B. subtilis flagellin with or without 30 μg/ml OxPAPC. HASMC were challenged with medium alone (DMEM, 1% FCS) or 10–1000 ng/ml poly(I·C). Alternatively, cells were challenged with 10 ng/ml Pam3CSK4, 10 ng/ml LPS, 500 ng/ml flagellin, or 1 μg/ml poly(I·C) with 0–30 μg/ml OxPAPC. In other experiments J774A.1 cells were challenged with 1 mm loxoribine, 2.5 μg/ml ssRNA, 10 μg/ml CpG DNA with or without 30 μg/ml OxPAPC. Supernatants from challenged cells were assessed for IL-8 content by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D DuoSet) after 18 h or TNF-α content (R&D DuoSet or L929 bioassay (29Delahooke D. Barclay G. Poxton I.R. Infect. Immun. 1996; 63: 840-846Crossref Google Scholar)) after 4 h. For serum dependence experiments, macrophages were washed three times in serum-free medium before challenge with PAMPs at the indicated concentrations in serum-free medium or serum supplemented with 1% FCS. Western Blotting—To investigate the impact of OxPAPC on intracellular signaling pathways stimulated by TLRs, THP-1 macrophages were plated in 12-well plates (5 × 105 cells per well) and challenged with medium alone, 250 ng/ml TNF-α (Peprotech), or 10 ng/ml LPS with or without 50 μg/ml OxPAPC co-treatment for 20 min before lysis. Alternatively, J774A.1 cells were challenged with medium alone (DMEM, 1% FCS), 10 ng/ml Pam3CSK4, 10 ng/ml LPS, 1 mm loxoribine, or 10 μg/ml CpG DNA with or without 50 μg/ml OxPAPC co-treatment for 20 min before lysis. Samples were boiled with 0.1 m dithiothreitol and separated by reducing denaturing PAGE before blotting to nitrocellulose. Blots were then probed with antibodies to IκBα (Santa Cruz), phospho-p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling), or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Santa Cruz) and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Reporter Assays—For transfection assays, HEK-293 cells were plated in 96-well plates at 2 × 104 cells per well and transfected after 24 h using Genejuice (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amounts of construct per well were 30 ng of human TLRs 2, 4 (co-expressing MD-2), or 5 (Invivogen), 30 ng of pCD14, 20 ng of transfection efficiency control renilla luciferase-reporter construct (pRL-TK), and 10 ng of firefly luciferase-reporter construct driven by NF-κB-dependent promoter (pELAM) cloned into pGL3 (Promega) as described previously (28Erridge C. Webb D.J. Spickett C.M. Atherosclerosis. 2007; 193: 77-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), with the balance made up with empty pCDNA3. Cells were grown for 2–3 days post-transfection before an 18 h challenge with PAMPs in the presence or absence of 10–30 μg/ml OxPAPC. Reporter levels were normalized to co-transfected renilla reporter expression. Promoter expression is represented as -fold induction relative to cells cultured in medium alone ±S.D. To determine requirements of membrane CD14 expression, cells were transfected with TLRs ±30 ng per well of pCD14 or pCDNA3. All constructs used other than pRL-TK were of human origin. Serum Lipid Shuttle Protein Experiments—HEK-293 cells transfected with TLR2 or TLR4·MD2 and NF-κB reporter were challenged with 100 ng/ml Pam3CSK4 or 1 ng/ml LPS with or without 30 μg/ml OxPAPC in DMEM supplemented with 1, 10, or 30% serum. Alternatively HEK-293-TLR2 cells were challenged with 100 ng/ml Pam3CSK4 in the presence or absence of 0.5 or 2.0 μg/ml recombinant sCD14 (R&D) or 0.3 or 1.0 μg/ml LBP purified from human plasma (Hycult biotechnology). After 18 h, expression of reporter was measured by luminometry as described above. Membrane Disruption and Cell Viability Assays—Membrane cholesterol disrupting agents MBCD, nystatin, or OxPAPC were added to THP-1 macrophages at 0.032–10 mm, 3.2–1000 μm, or 10–300 μg/ml, respectively. 18 h later, cellular viability was monitored by MTT assay as described previously (30Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46496) Google Scholar). Alternatively, THP-1 macrophages were challenged with 10 ng/ml Pam3CSK4 or LPS in the presence of MBCD or nystatin at 300–1200 or 1–5 μm, respectively. Supernatant TNF-α was measured at 4 h as described above. MD2 Binding Assays—Soluble MD2 protein was prepared by transfection of HEK-293 cells plated in 12-well plates (2 × 105 cells per well) with 1 μg per well of a construct expressing FLAG-His-tagged MD2 (pEFBOS-MD2, a kind gift of Prof. K. Miyake). MD-2-containing supernatant was collected at 48 h. For MD2 immobilization, 100 μl per well of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was added to high binding immunoassay strips (Nunc Immunomodule) before washing 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween and adding MD-2 supernatant for 2 h. Wells were then washed, and 500 ng/ml biotinylated LPS (Invivogen) was added in the presence of 0, 10, or 25 μg/ml native or oxidized PAPC for a further 2 h to allow binding to immobilized MD2. Wells were washed once again, and bound biotinylated LPS was measured by the addition of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and colorimetric determination at 450 nm after the addition of HRP substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. For MD2 co-precipitation experiments, MD2 supernatant was incubated with 1 μg/ml biotinylated LPS with or without 15 min preincubation with 10 μg/ml unlabeled LPS or 50 μg/ml OxPAPC. Streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) were then added to mixtures and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 10 min), resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled, and separated on 15% SDS-PAGE gels before transfer to nitrocellulose blots. Precipitated MD2 was visualized by probing blots with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). To assess functional effects of OxPAPC effects on MD2, MD2 supernatant was preincubated with 50 μg/ml OxPAPC for 30 min before the addition of 100 ng/ml LPS. Supernatants were then added to HEK-293 cells transfected with TLR4 and reporter constructs without MD2 cotransfection. Activation of NF-κB-dependent reporter was measured at 18 h as described above. Animal Experiments— 8-Week-old male BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously with 50 μl of saline, 2.5 μg of Pam3CSK4, or 2.5 μg of Pam3CSK4 with 7.5 μg of OxPAPC (n = 3 per group). Skin around each injection site was removed from killed animals after 24 h, and extent of inflammatory infiltrate was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Polymorphonuclear granulocyte (PMN) infiltration into subcutaneous tissue was quantified by counting PMNs present in low power fields of Sudan black-stained sections. Alternatively, mice (n = 4 per group) were injected intraperitoneally with 200 μl of saline, 10 μg of Pam3CSK4, or 10 μg of Pam3CSK4 with 50 μg OxPAPC. Cells were counted in peritoneal lavage fluid (3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline) after 24 h using a hemocytometer. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the United Kingdom Home Office Guide on the Operation of Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. OxPAPC Inhibits Signaling via TLR2 and TLR4 but Not Other TLRs—To establish whether the ability of OxPLs to inhibit TLR4 signaling extended to other TLRs, the capacity of OxPAPC to modulate cytokine release induced by defined PAMPs specific for other TLRs was assessed. As expected, OxPAPC inhibited the production of TNF-α by THP-1 macrophages in response to challenge with the TLR2 ligand Pam3CSK4 or the TLR4 ligand E. coli LPS in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal inhibition occurring at 30 μg/ml (Fig. 1). However, TNF-α production in response to the TLR5 ligand flagellin was found to be unaltered by OxPAPC treatment (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained with primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (not shown). TNF-α production by J774A.1 macrophages in response to the TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 ligands loxoribine, ssRNA, and CpG DNA, respectively, was also unaltered by OxPAPC (Fig. 2). We found that human and murine macrophages produced very little or no TNF-α in response to the TLR3 ligand poly(I·C). However, poly(I·C) potently up-regulated the production of IL-8 by human aortic smooth muscle cells, and this response was not significantly altered by co-treatment with OxPAPC (Fig. 2). OxPAPC pretreatment of cells for 1 h before challenge also had no effect on cytokine production in response to these PAMPs (data not shown).FIGURE 2Effect of OxPAPC on cytokine responses to agonists of TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9. HASMC were challenged with indicated concentrations of the TLR3 ligand poly(I·C) in the presence or absence of 30 μg/ml OxPAPC (A), or with 10 μg/ml poly(I·C) and the indicated concentrations of OxPAPC (B). Supernatant IL-8 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at 18 h. C, J774A.1 macrophages were challenged with medium alone (Ctrl), 10 ng/ml LPS, 1 mm loxoribine (Lox), 2.5 μg/ml ssRNA, or 10 μg/ml CpG DNA with or without 30 μg/ml OxPAPC. Supernatant TNF-α content was measured 4 h after challenge. Results shown are means of triplicate cultures ± S.D. and are representative of at least two similar experiments. n.s., not significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether the specificity of OxPAPC inhibition of TLRs could be verified using alternative readouts of TLR-induced signaling, the activation of NF-κB dependent reporter transcription was examined in HEK-293 cells transfected with vector alone, TLR2, TLR5, or TLR4·MD2.

Although hundreds of miRNAs have been cloned or predicted, only very few miRNAs have been functionally characterized. Embryo implantation is a crucial step in mammalian reproduction. Many genes have been shown to be significantly changed in mouse uterus during embryo implantation. However, miRNA expression profiles in the mouse uterus between implantation sites and inter-implantation sites are still unknown. In this study, miRNA microarray was used to examine differential expression of miRNAs in the mouse uterus between implantation sites and inter-implantation sites. Compared with inter-implantation sites, there were 8 up-regulated miR-NAs at implantation sites, which were confirmed by both Northern blot and in situ hybridization. miR-21 was highly expressed in the subluminal stromal cells at implantation sites on day 5 of pregnancy. Because miR-21 was not detected in mouse uterus during pseudopregnancy and under delayed implantation, miR-21 expression at implantation sites was regulated by active blastocysts. Furthermore, we showed that Reck was the target gene of miR-21. Our data suggest that miR-21 may play a key role during embryo implantation.

The implantation of the blastocyst into the maternal uterus is a crucial step in mammalian reproduction and involves a reciprocal interaction between the blastocyst and receptive uterus (1Wang H. Dey S.K. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Many factors are involved in embryo implantation through endocrine, paracrine, autocrine, and/or juxtacrine actions (2Dey S.K. Lim H. Das S.K. Reese J. Paria B.C. Daikoku T. Wang H. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Impaired uterine receptivity is one of the major reasons for the failure of assisted reproductive techniques (3Edwards R.G. Human Reprod. 1995; 10: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Defects in implantation and trophoblast invasion are presently considered the major challenges for the successful establishment of pregnancy (4Herrler A. Von Rango U. Beier H.M. Reprod. Biomed. On-line. 2003; 6: 244-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although many specific factors have been identified during the implantation period, the molecular mechanism of embryo implantation is still unknown.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) 2The abbreviations used are:miRNAmicroRNALNAlocked nucleic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineUTRuntranslated regionDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumRTreverse transcriptionntnucleotideDIGdigoxigeninLIFleukemia inhibitory factorSTATsignal transducers and activators of transcription. 2The abbreviations used are:miRNAmicroRNALNAlocked nucleic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineUTRuntranslated regionDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumRTreverse transcriptionntnucleotideDIGdigoxigeninLIFleukemia inhibitory factorSTATsignal transducers and activators of transcription. are 21-24-nucleotide non-coding RNAs and found in diverse organisms from plants to humans (5Brown J.R.

Ther. 2007; 15: 2070-2079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In animals, mature miRNAs are incorporated into the RNA inducing silencing complex, and target specific messenger RNAs via imperfect base pairing for translational repression or mRNA cleavage (7Krutzfeldt J. Poy M.N. Stoffel M. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: S14-S19Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Dicer is a cytoplasmic multidomain RNase III enzyme that processes the pre-miRNA to produce mature miRNAs. Dicer-deficient embryos showed a retarded phenotype and died between days 12.5 and 14.5 of gestation due to angiogenesis defects (8Yang W.J. Yang D.D. Na S. Sandusky G.E. Zhang Q. Zhao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9330-9335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The growing oocytes from the mice with a specific deletion of Dicer failed to progress through the first cell division, probably because of disorganized spindle formation (9Tang F. Kaneda M. O'Carroll D. Hajkova P. Barton S.C. Sun Y.A. Lee C. Tarakhovsky A. Lao K. Surani M.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar).It is currently estimated that miRNAs account for ∼1% of predicted genes in higher eukaryotic genomes and that up to 30% of genes might be regulated by miRNAs. Although hundreds of miRNAs have been cloned and/or predicted, only very few miRNAs have been functionally characterized and the general functions of miRNAs are not globally studied (10Yu Z. Jian Z. Shen S.H. Purisima E. Wang E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Through the analysis of mRNA expression by microarray and SAGE, many genes are shown to be significantly changed in mouse uterus between implantation sites and inter-implantation sites (11Reese J. Das S.K. Paria B.C. Lim H. Song H. Matsumoto H. Knudtson K.L. DuBois R.N. Dey S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44137-44145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 12Ma X.H.

However, miRNA expression profile in the mouse uterus between implantation sites and inter-implantation sites is still unknown. Locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified capture probes enable high affinity hybridizations and can discriminate between single nucleotide differences in closely related miRNA family members (13Castoldi M. Benes V. Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Methods. 2007; 43: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). LNA-modified microarrays were used to distinguish miRNA expression patterns in the mouse uterus at implantation sites in this study. The expression and regulation of target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were also investigated.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimal Treatments—Mature mice (Kunming White outbred strain) were maintained in a controlled environment with a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Xiamen University. Female mice were mated with fertile or vasectomized males of the same strain to induce pregnancy or pseudopregnancy (day 1 is the day of vaginal plug). The implantation sites on day 5 of pregnancy were identified by intravenous injection of 0.1 ml of 1% Chicago blue (Sigma). The implantation sites and inter-implantation sites on day 5 of pregnancy were collected and stored at -80 °C until ready for miRNA microarray analysis.For delayed implantation, pregnant mice were ovariectomized under ether anesthesia at 08:30-09:00 h on day 4 of pregnancy. Delayed implantation was maintained from days 5 to 7 by injecting progesterone (1 mg/mouse, Sigma). Estradiol-17β (25 ng/mouse, Sigma) was given to progesterone-primed delayed implantation mice to initiate delayed implantation. The mice were sacrificed to collect uteri 24 h after estrogen treatment. Delayed implantation was confirmed by flushing the blastocysts from one horn of the uterus.Treatments with steroid hormones were started 2 weeks after ovariectomy. The ovariectomized mice were treated with an injection of estradiol-17β (100 ng/mouse) or progesterone (1 mg/mouse) for 24 h. All steroids were dissolved in sesame oil and injected subcutaneously. Controls received the vehicle only (0.1 ml/mouse).miRNA Microarray—Small RNAs were isolated from mouse uteri at implantation sites and inter-implantation sites using the PureLink™ miRNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen) and labeled with Cy3 dye using the miRCURY™ LNA Array labeling kit (Exiqon, Denmark) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The Cy3-labeled RNA molecules were hybridized with miRCURY LNA Arrays (Exiqon, Denmark), consisting of control probes, mismatch probes, and 427 capture probes, perfectly matched probes for all human, mouse, and rat miRNAs as registered and annotated in the miRBase release 7.1 at The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Gene Pix 4000B scanner and GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) were used to scan images. Each group was hybridized with three miRCURY LNA Arrays in triplicate with independent samples for implantation or inter-implantation sites, respectively.The median intensities for each feature and the corresponding background were calculated. After the median intensity of the background was subtracted from the median intensity of the feature, the net intensity values were normalized to perchip median values. As a result, each chip had a median value of 400. These normalized intensity values were then used to obtain geometric means of each miRNA. Arithmetic mean and S.E. for two groups in triplicate were calculated and -fold changes were measured. Each miRNA signal was transformed to logarithm base 2 and two-sample t test was conducted. miRNAs with a significant value of 0.05 or lower and -fold change values of 2 or higher were listed and supposed to be differentially expressed between implantation sites and inter-implantation sites. Statistical analysis was conducted by MAT-LAB 7.0 (The MathWorks, Inc.).In Situ Hybridization—Uteri were cut into 4-7-mm pieces, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Frozen sections (10 μm) were mounted on 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (Sigma)-coated slides and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS. In situ hybridization was performed as previously described (14Ni H. Sun T. Ding N.Z. Ma X.H. Yang Z.M. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All the digoxigenin-labeled LNA probes for each miRNA were purchased from Exiqon. The hybridization temperature for each probe was 21 °C below the Tm (calculated melting temperature of the miRCURY detection probe). Endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity was inhibited with 2 mm levamisole (Sigma). All of the sections were counterstained with 1% methyl green. The positive signal was visualized as a dark brown color.For performing in situ hybridization of Reck mRNA expression, total RNAs from mouse uterus were reverse transcribed and amplified with the corresponding primers for mouse Reck (5′-ACTATGTGCTGGGATGTTACGG and 5′-GATGACGGGAGACTGCTGGA, accession number NM_016678). The amplified fragment was cloned into pGEM-T plasmid (pGEM-T Vector System 1, Promega, Madison, WI) and verified by sequencing. The recombinant plasmid was amplified with the primers for T7 and SP6 to prepare templates for labeling sense or antisense probes. Digoxigenin-labeled Reck antisense or sense cRNA probe was transcribed in vitro using DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). In situ hybridization was performed as mentioned above and previously described (14Ni H. Sun T. Ding N.Z. Ma X.H. Yang Z.M. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Northern Blot—Small RNAs were isolated from mouse uteri using the mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Am1560). One microgram of small RNAs was resolved on 15% acrylamide, 8 m urea gel, transferred onto nylon membranes, and UV cross-linked. Digoxigenin-labeled LNA probe for each miRNA was purchased from Exiqon. Hybridization was performed in the hybridization solution (BioDev, MK161-2, Beijing, China) at 42 °C for 16 h. The membranes were washed in 2× SSC with 0.1% SDS at 42 °C twice for 5 min each and in washing buffer (0.1 m maleic acid, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20) at room temperature for 5 min. After blocking in 1% Blocking reagent (Roche) for 30 min, the membranes were incubated with antidigoxigenin antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase for 30 min. Following washing in washing buffer and detection buffer (0.1 m Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 9.5), the membranes were incubated in CDP-Star (Roche), exposed and developed. U6 RNA was used as loading control for normalization.Dual-Luciferase Activity Assay—For luciferase reporter experiments, the 3′-UTR segment of mouse Reck predicted to interact with miR-21 was amplified by PCR from mouse cDNA and inserted into the pGL3 control vector (Promega), using the FseI and XbaI sites immediately downstream from the stop codon of luciferase. Primers used for amplifying the 3′-UTR of mouse Reck were 5′-CACTCTAGATGTCTGACTTTCCTTTGATA and 5′-ACTGGCCGGCCTATTGCTATATTTCAGAGGGTA (accession number NM_016678), in which FseI and XbaI sites were underlined, respectively. The recombinant pGL3 was designated as Reck-pGL3. pRL-TK containing Renilla luciferase was co-transfected with Reck-pGL3 for data normalization.Mouse 3T3 cells were pre-plated in 24-well tissue culture plates at a concentration of 3 × 104 cells per well and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum. The next day 3T3 cells were transfected with 40 ng of pRL-TK and 200 ng of Reck-pGL3 vector. These 3T3 cells were co-transfected with miR-21 precursor (pre-miR-21), the negative control of Pre-miR™ miRNA Precursor, miR-21 inhibitor (anti-miR-21), or Anti-miR™ Negative Control (Ambion), respectively. All the transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Cell lysate was collected and assayed 30 h after transfection. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and each transfected well was assayed in triplicate.Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNAs were extracted from mouse uteri or cultured cells with TRIzol reagent, digested with DNase I, and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with the PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit (Perfect Real Time, TaKaLa, Dalian, China). There were 0.5 μg of total RNAs, 2 μl of PrimeScript Buffer, 25 pmol of Oligo(dT) Primer, 50 pmol of Random 6-mers, and 0.5 μl of PrimeScript RT Enzyme Mix I in a 10-μl volume. Reverse transcription was performed at 37 °C for 15 min and 85 °C for 5 s. Real time PCR was performed using a SYBR Premix Ex Taq™ kit (TaKaLa DRR041S) on the Rotor-Gene 3000A system (Corbett Research, Mortlake, VIC, Australia) at 95 °C for 10 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 34 s. All reactions were run in triplicate. Primers used for real time RT-PCR are listed in Table 1.

Tissues were then placed in 5 ml of fresh medium (Hanks' balanced salt solution with antibiotics) containing 6 mg/ml dispase (Invitrogen) and 10 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma), and incubated in sequence for 1 h at 4 °C, 1 h at room temperature, and then 10 min at 37 °C. Following the digestion steps, tissues were shaken several times to dislodge the sheet of luminal epithelial cells. After the supernatant containing epithelial cells was discarded, the tissues remaining after the digestion were washed three times in fresh medium and digested in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.15 mg/ml collagenase (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 30 min. Following digestion and shaking, the digested cells (mainly for stromal cells) were passed through a 70-μm filter to eliminate epithelial sheets and centrifuged. The cell pellets were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and re-suspended in phenol red-free DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics. Cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells per 25-square cm dish. After an initial culture for 1 h, the medium was changed to remove free-floating cells and replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum.RECK Overexpression—When cultured uterine stromal cells reached 80% confluence, transfection was performed with Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected with RECK overexpression vector pCMVβ-RECK (kindly provided by Dr. Hansoo Kim, Seoul National University, Korea) in 250 μl of Opti-MEMI Reduced Serum Medium without serum. pcDNA3.1(+) was used for control. Medium was changed 6 h later. Cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and then in serum-free DMEM for an additional 24 h. RECK overexpression was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot. Conditioned medium was collected and subjected to gelatin zymography.Western Blot—Cells were collected in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.25% sodium deoxycholate) and briefly sonicated to shear DNA and reduce sample viscosity. Protein concentration was measured by the BCA Reagent kit (Applygen, Beijing, China). Samples were run on a 8% PAGE gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After being blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TPBS (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) for 1 h, the membranes were incubated with monoclonal anti-human RECK (1:500, MBL International Corporation, Woburn, MA) overnight at 4 °C. After three washes in 5% milk/TPBS for 10 min each, the membranes were incubated in goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with horse-radish peroxidase for 1 h followed by two washes in 5% milk/TPBS, TPBS, and PBS for 5 min each, respectively. The signals were developed in ECL Chemiluminescent kit (Amersham Biosciences).Gelatin Zymography—After conditioned medium was collected, the cell number was determined by counting using a hemocytometer. Conditioned medium from an equal number of cells was separated on 10% acrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin (Sigma). The gels were incubated in 2.5% Triton X-100 solution at room temperature with gentle agitation to remove SDS and were soaked in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm ZnCl2) at 37 °C overnight. Then the gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue in 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 1 h, and destained in the same solution without Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Gelatinolytic activity of Mmp-2 and Mmp-9 was visualized as clear bands against a dark background of stained gelatin.RESULTSMicroarray Analysis of miRNA Expression at Implantation Sites—To examine differential expression of miRNAs in mouse uterus between implantation sites and inter-implantation sites, miRNA microarray analysis was performed using the miRCURY LNA microarray from Exiqon containing 427 miRNAs, of which 249 are mouse miRNAs. Scatter plot and hierarchical clustering analysis are shown in Fig. 1. Compared with inter-implantation sites, 13 miRNAs were up-regulated at least 2-fold, and 2 miRNAs were down-regulated at least 2-fold at implantation sites in the mouse uterus. The up-regulated genes were miR-143, miR-298, let-7a, let-7c, let-7d, let-7b, miR-21, miR-20a, let-7g, miR-26a, let-7i, let-7e, and let-7f. Two down-regulated genes were miR-290-5p and miR-292-5p (Table 2).TABLE 2List of the miRNAs with at least 2-fold changes at implantation sitesmiRNAFold (IM/Inter-IM)Nonpaired t testmiR-1434.370.005miR-2983.520.005let-7a2.780.018let-7c2.710.019let-7d2.680.015let-7b2.570.015miR-212.350.009miR-20a2.300.011let-7g2.260.019miR-26a2.240.018let-7i2.210.016let-7e2.130.006let-7f2.020.030miR-290-5p−3.230.003miR-292-5p−3.450.003 Open table in a new tab Confirmation of miRNA Microarray Data at Implantation Sites on Day 5—To confirm results from miRNA microarray, 8 miRNAs from the up-regulated ones were chosen for Northern blot analysis. Compared with inter-implantation sites, all of the 8 miRNAs were up-regulated at implantation sites, including miR-143, miR-21, miR-20a, miR-26a, let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, and let-7d (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Northern blot confirmation of miRNA microarray data. A, Northern blot analysis for 8 miRNAs from the up-regulated ones in mouse uteri at both implantation sites (IM) and inter-implantation sites (Inter-IM). After the density of each band was normalized with its corresponding U6 density, the ratio between IM and I-IM was shown at the right side. B, miR-143 editing. Different lengths of miR-143 with different modifications were chemically synthesized, including mature miR-143 (21 nt), mature miR-143+U (22 nt), and mature miR-143+UU (23 nt). These standards and small RNAs from day 5 mouse uterus at implantation sites were run on the same gel and hybridized with miR-143 probe. C, Northern blot analysis of miR-298, miR-290-5p, and miR-292-5p expression at both implantation sites and inter-implantation sites in day 5 pregnant mouse uterus. Small RNAs from implantation sites were run and hybridized with the miR-21 probe to show the locations of both precursor and mature miR-21. There were no detectable mature forms for miR-298, miR-290-5p, and miR-292-5p.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In our study, two bands at the location of mature miR-143 were clearly detected in the mouse uterus by Northern blot, either at implantation sites or inter-implantation sites. To know the sizes of two bands of miR-143, we chemically synthesized different lengths of artificial miR-143 with different modifications, including mature miR-143 (21 nt), mature miR-143+U (22 nt), and mature miR-143+UU (23 nt). These standards and small RNAs from implantation sites were run on the same gel and hybridized with miR-143 probe. Compared with these standards, the upper band in our Northern blot should be 21 nt and the lower band 20 nt (Fig. 2B).We also performed Northern blot to confirm the expression of miR-298, miR-290-5p, and miR-292-5p. However, there were no detectable mature forms for miR-298, miR-290-5p, and miR-292-5p (Fig. 2C). The precursor forms for miR-290-5p and miR-292-5p were strongly detected at both implantation sites and inter-implantation sites. A strong band sized between precursor and mature forms was detected for miR-298. Because there were no detectable mature forms, miR-298, miR-290-5p, and miR-292-5p were not used for further analysis.To further confirm results from miRNA microarray and examine tissue distribution of miRNA expression, 8 miRNAs from the up-regulated ones were also chosen for in situ hybridization in the uterus on day 5 of pregnancy (Fig. 3). miR-21 was not expressed at inter-implantation sites, but was strongly expressed in the subluminal stroma surrounding the implanting blastocyst at implantation sites. Compared with inter-implantation sites, the expression levels of miR-143, miR-20a, miR-26a, let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, and let-7d were slightly higher in the subluminal stroma at implantation sites.FIGURE 3In situ hybridization confirmation for 8 miRNAs significantly up-regulated at implantation sites.

In situ hybridization was performed to examine miR-21 expression and regulation in mouse uterus during early pregnancy. miR-21 expression was not detected in the mouse uterus from days 1 to 4 of pregnancy. On day 5 of pregnancy, although miR-21 expression was not detected at inter-implantation sites, miR-21 was strongly expressed in the subluminal stroma underlying the implanting blastocyst at implantation site. When 5′-DIG-labeled miR-21 probe was replaced with 5′-DIG-labeled Scramble-miR probe (Exiqon), there was no detectable signal in day 5 mouse uterus at implantation site. From days 6 to 8 of pregnancy, miR-21 expression was also highly detected in the decidua (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4In situ hybridization of miR-21 expression in mouse uteri. miR-21 expression during early pregnancy was shown on days 1 (D1), 2 (D2), 3 (D3), 4 (D4), 5 (D5(I) for implantation site and D5(NI) for inter-implantation site), 6 (D6), and 8 (D8). miR-21 expression in day 5 pseudopregnant uterus was also shown (PD5). miR-21 expression was not detected under delayed implantation (Delay), but was strongly seen in the stromal cells after activation by estrogen treatment (Activation). When 5′-DIG-labeled miR-21 probe was replaced with 5′-DIG-labeled Scramble-miR probe, there was no detectable signal in day 5 mouse uterus at the implantation site (D5(control)). *, implanting blastocyst. Bar = 100 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To see whether miR-21 expression was dependent upon the presence of embryos, the uterus on day 5 of pseudopregnancy was performed for in situ hybridization analysis. miR-21 expression was not detected in the uterus on day 5 of pseudopregnancy (Fig. 4), suggesting that miR-21 expression was dependent upon the presence of embryos.To examine whether miR-21 expression was dependent upon the active status of embryos, a delayed implantation model was used for in situ hybridization analysis (Fig. 4). Under delayed implantation, miR-21 expression was not detected in the uterus. After delayed implantation was terminated by estrogen treatment and embryos implanted, miR-21 expression was strongly seen in the subluminal stroma at the implantation site, suggesting that miR-21 expression was dependent upon the presence of active blastocysts.To examine whether miR-21 expression was regulated by steroid hormones, Northern blot was performed (Fig. 5). In the ovariectomized mouse uterus, a high level of miR-21 expression was detected. Progesterone slightly down-regulated miR-21 expression, whereas miR-21 expression was significantly reduced by estradiol-17β treatment.FIGURE 5Northern blot analysis of miR-21 expression in the ovariectomized mouse uteri. Ovariectomized mice were treated with sesame oil (for control), progesterone, or estraodiol-17β for 24 h. After the density of each band was normalized with its corresponding U6 density, the ratio among treatments was shown in the middle. miR-21 expression was down-regulated by either progesterone or estrogen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Relationship between miR-21 and Tmem49—In this study, we showed that miR-21 was highly expressed at implantation sites rather than at inter-implantation sites. Because the miR-21 gene is located in the 3′-UTR region of Tmem49, real time RT-PCR was performed to check the Tmem49 expression level with a pair of primers located in the 3′-UTR region of Tmem49 to evaluate miR-21 expression (Fig. 6). On day 5 of pregnancy, Tmem49 expression at implantation sites was significantly higher than that at inter-implantation sites, suggesting that Tmem49 and miR-21 were co-expressed.FIGURE 6Real time RT-PCR of Tmem49 expression.

https://openalex.org/W2020763506,"Activation of glomerular mesangial cells (MCs) by angiotensin II (Ang II) leads to hypertrophy and extracellular matrix accumulation. Here, we demonstrate that, in MCs, Ang II induces an increase in PDK-1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1) kinase activity that required its phosphorylation on tyrosine 9 and 373/376. Introduction into the cells of PDK-1, mutated on these tyrosine residues or kinase-inactive, attenuates Ang II-induced hypertrophy and fibronectin accumulation. Ang II-mediated PDK-1 activation and tyrosine phosphorylation (total and on residues 9 and 373/376) are inhibited in cells transfected with small interfering RNA for Src, indicating that Src is upstream of PDK-1. In cells expressing oxidation-resistant Src mutant C487A, Ang II-induced hypertrophy and fibronectin expression are prevented, suggesting that the pathway is redox-sensitive. Ang II also up-regulates Nox4 protein, and siNox4 abrogates the Ang II-induced increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Small interfering RNA for Nox4 also inhibits Ang II-induced activation of Src and PDK-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (total and on residues 9 and 373/376), demonstrating that Nox4 functions upstream of Src and PDK-1. Importantly, inhibition of Nox4, Src, or PDK-1 prevents the stimulatory effect of Ang II on fibronectin accumulation and cell hypertrophy. This work provides the first evidence that Nox4-derived ROS are responsible for Ang II-induced PDK-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation through stimulation of Src. Importantly, this pathway contributes to Ang II-induced MC hypertrophy and fibronectin accumulation. These data shed light on molecular processes underlying the oxidative signaling cascade engaged by Ang II and identify potential targets for intervention to prevent renal hypertrophy and fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2090629572,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted Alphavirus that causes in humans an acute infection characterized by polyarthralgia, fever, myalgia, and headache. Since 2005 this virus has been responsible for an epidemic outbreak of unprecedented magnitude. By analogy with other alphaviruses, it is thought that cellular proteases are able to process the viral precursor protein E3E2 to produce the receptor-binding E2 protein that associates as a heterodimer with E1. Destabilization of the heterodimer by exposure to low pH allows viral fusion and infection. We show that among a large panel of proprotein convertases, membranous furin but also PC5B can process E3E2 from African CHIKV strains at the HRQRR64↓ST site, whereas a CHIKV strain of Asian origin is cleaved at RRQRR64↓SI by membranous and soluble furin, PC5A, PC5B, and PACE4 but not by PC7 or SKI-1. Using fluorogenic model peptides and recombinant convertases, we observed that the Asian strain E3E2 model peptide is cleaved most efficiently by furin and PC5A. This cleavage was also observed in CHIKV-infected cells and could be blocked by furin inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone. This inhibitor was compared with chloroquine for its ability to inhibit CHIKV spreading in myoblast cell cultures, a cell-type previously described as a natural target of this virus. Our results demonstrate the role of furin-like proteases in the processing of CHIKV particles and point out new approaches to inhibit this infection.

It is responsible for an acute infection of abrupt onset characterized by high fever, polyarthralgia, myalgia, headache, chills, and rash (1Weaver S.C. Frolov I.V. Mahy B. ter Meulen V. Topley and Wilson's Microbiology & Microbial Infections; Virology. 10th Ed. Hodder Arnold, London2005Google Scholar). The symptoms are generally of short duration (1 week), and recovery is often complete, although some patients have recurrent episodes for several weeks after infection (1Weaver S.C. Frolov I.V. Mahy B. ter Meulen V. Topley and Wilson's Microbiology & Microbial Infections; Virology. 10th Ed. Hodder Arnold, London2005Google Scholar, 2Mohan A. Indian J. Med. Res. 2006; 124: 471-474PubMed Google Scholar). CHIKV is endemic in Africa, India, and Southeast Asia and is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes through an urban or sylvatic transmission cycle. In 2006 an outbreak of CHIKV fever occurred in numerous islands of the Indian Ocean (the Comoros, Mauritius, Seychelles, Madagascar, La Réunion, etc.) before jumping to India where an estimated 1.4 million cases have been reported (3Charrel R.N. de Lamballerie X.

More recently, imported infections have been described in Europe, and around 200 endemic cases have been reported in Italy (6Rezza G. Nicoletti L. Angelini R. Romi R. Finarelli A.C. Panning M. Cordioli P. Fortuna C. Boros S. Magurano F. Silvi G. Angelini P. Dottori M. Ciufolini M.G. Majori G.C. Cassone A.

Clinically, this CHIKV epidemic was accompanied by more severe symptoms than previous outbreaks, with reports of severe polyarthralgia and myalgia, complications, and deaths. In muscle biopsies from two infected adults we could identify cellular targets for CHIKV as muscle satellite cells (the muscle progenitor cells) and confirmed in vitro the susceptibility of these cells to CHIKV infection (7Ozden S. Huerre M. Riviere J.P. Coffey L.L. Afonso P.V. Mouly V. de Monredon J. Roger J.C. El Amrani M. Yvin J.L. Jaffar M.C. Frenkiel M.P. Sourisseau M. Schwartz O. Butler-Browne G. Despres P. Gessain A. Ceccaldi P.E. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e527Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Up until now no other cell targets have been identified in humans except for a recent report showing that fibroblast cells were infected in a fatal neonatal case (8Couderc T. Chretien F. Schilte C.

PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e29Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Other cell types such as human epithelial and endothelial cells, primary fibroblasts, and to a lesser extent, monocyte-derived macrophages, were shown in vitro to be susceptible to infection and allowed viral production with a cytopathic effect (9Sourisseau M.

Treatment of CHIKV-induced fever is only symptomatic, including use of paracetamol or non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (2Mohan A. Indian J. Med. Res. 2006; 124: 471-474PubMed Google Scholar). To date only a limited open pilot study has been carried out with chloroquine as a treatment of chronic Chikungunya arthritis on 10 patients, with improvement in symptoms such as morning stiffness (10Brighton S.W. S. Afr. Med. J. 1984; 66: 217-218PubMed Google Scholar) and another where a single patient did not respond to chloroquine (11Taubitz W. Cramer J.P. Kapaun A. Pfeffer M. Drosten C. Dobler G. Burchard G.D. Loscher T. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2007; 45: e1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). More recently, an unsuccessful clinical trial with chloroquine has been performed during the CHIKV outbreak in La Réunion but with chloroquine doses that are thought to be below the efficient concentrations (12Savarino A. Cauda R. Cassone A. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2007; 7: 633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, a recent paper demonstrated an effect of chloroquine on CHIKV infection in vitro in HeLa cells (9Sourisseau M. Schilte C. Casartelli N. Trouillet C. Guivel-Benhassine F. Rudnicka D.

Besides chloroquine, infection by alphaviruses can be inhibited in vitro by blocking the intracellular cleavage of viral envelope glycoproteins. Alphavirus envelope glycoproteins are initially produced first as precursors (E3E2 or p62) and during virion maturation further cleaved at short multibasic motifs. Among cellular proteases, the basic amino acid-specific furin or furin-like proprotein convertases (PCs) have been shown to be involved in such a Ca2+-dependent processing, resulting in the cleavage of surface glycoproteins at the C terminus of the consensus sequence (K/R)X(K/R)R↓ (16Barr P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 17Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 18Zhang X. Fugere M.

In the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or in a post-TGN compartment, E3E2 is cleaved close to its N terminus to form E2 and a residual peptide E3 (19Mayne J.T. Rice C.M. Strauss E.G. Hunkapiller M.W. Strauss J.H. Virology. 1984; 134: 338-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Amino acid changes within the cleavage site have been shown to induce defects in viral production due to the presence of uncleaved E3E2 precursor, as demonstrated for Sindbis virus (20Heidner H.W. Johnston R.E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8064-8070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Heidner H.W. Knott T.A. Johnston R.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2069-2073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Klimstra W.B. Heidner H.W. Johnston R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6299-6306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such a block in infection could also be produced for Semliki Forest virus (23Salminen A. Wahlberg J.M. Lobigs M. Liljestrom P. Garoff H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and exposure of the virus to very low pH restores infectivity (24Wahlberg J.M. Bron R. Wilschut J. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7309-7318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present paper we show that among a large panel of PCs, furin, but also other furin-like proteases, can process CHIKV E3E2 in vitro and in vivo. Furin can best process synthetic peptides mimicking the cleavage site. We also investigated the inhibitory effect of an irreversible furin-inhibiting peptide decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone (dec-RVKR-cmk) (25Hallenberger S. Bosch V. Angliker H. Shaw E. Klenk H.D. Garten W. Nature. 1992; 360: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) on CHIKV infection of a natural cellular target, i.e. human muscle satellite cells. We demonstrate that dec-RVKR-cmk is able to induce a stronger inhibition of viral infection than chloroquine when added just after infection. Moreover, combination of both drugs induces an additive effect, which is enhanced when drugs are added before infection. Besides demonstrating a new way to inhibit CHIKV infection in natural cellular targets, these data demonstrate for the first time the role of furin-like proteases in the processing of CHIKV particles. Opening Reading Frame Cloning and Plasmid Constructs—E3E2-encoding sequence from CHIKV wild-type strain 05.115 (GenBank™ accession number AM258990) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (Titan One tube; Roche Applied Science) from purified genomic RNA and cloned using a recombination-based cloning system (Gateway® system; Invitrogen) into pDONR207 (Invitrogen). PCR primers E3-For and E2-Rev (Table 1) were used to amplify and clone the E3E2 sequence. 5′ extremities of E3-For and E2-Rev primers contained attB1.1 and attB2.1 sites, respectively. These sequences allowed recombination of PCR products into pDONR207 following the manufacturer's recommendations (BP cloning reaction, Invitrogen). Constructs were transformed and amplified in Escherichia coli DH5α strain. To mutate E3E2 wild-type sequence and introduce H60R or R63A and R64A substitutions, two-step PCRs were carried out. Two PCR fragments overlapping at the editing site were amplified from E3E2 wild-type sequence using either forward or reverse mutagenic primers (Table 1) in combination with appropriate E3-For or E2-Rev primers. Then the PCR fragments were mixed, and a ligating PCR was performed using only the attB-containing primers.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used to clone E3E2 and perform site-directed mutagenesisPrimer namePrimer sequenceE3-For5′-GGGGAAACTTTGTCAAAAAATTGGCATGGTCTTGCCACCCAGTTATTGCCTG-3′E2-Rev5′-GGGGAAACTTTGTCAAGAAATTGGCGCTTAGCTGTTCGATGCAG-3′H60R-For5′-ATGTTTCCCCGCCCCAGCGAGCA-3′H60R-Rev5′-TGCGTGCTGGCGGGGGGAGACAT-3′R63A, R64A-For5′-TTCTCCCACCGCCGGCAGCCGCACCAAGACAACTTCATGT-3′R63A, R64A-Rev5′-ACATTAAGTTGTCTTGGTGCGGCTGCCTGCGGTGGGGGAA-3′ Open table in a new tab A previously reported (26Seidah N.G.

Briefly, pIRES2-EGFP+V5 was linearized with BstEII and blunted before cloning the Gateway cassette frame B. Wild-type E3E2 sequence or corresponding mutants were shuffled from pDONR207 in this vector by in vitro recombination following the manufacturer's recommendations (LR cloning reaction, Invitrogen). The P2′ T66I mutant was obtained by PCR as described earlier (26Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B. Stifani S. Basak A. Prat A. Chretien M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chloroquine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used at concentrations of 1 or 2 μm. Proprotein Convertases, Cells, and Metabolic Labeling—For radiolabeling experiments, HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with 1 μg of a pIRES2 recombinant cDNA of CHIKV E3E2 tagged at the C terminus with a V5 epitope together with either 1 μg of empty vector or a similar vector coding for the convertase furin, a soluble form of furin (sFurin, lacking the transmembrane domain), PACE4, PC5A, PC5B, PC7, or SKI-1, similar to the SARS-CoV construct previously reported (27Bergeron E.

In the case of the furin co-transfection, the cells were either incubated with or without 10 μm chloroquine (Sigma) for 24 h before transfection. The cells were then labeled with [35S]Cys+Met for 4 h, and the cell lysates in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer were immunoprecipitated with a V5-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb-V5). The immunoprecipitates were resolved on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel, dried, and autoradiographed (28Benjannet S. Rhainds D. Hamelin J. Nassoury N. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30561-30572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Virus and Infection of Myoblasts—CHIKV was obtained from a clinical sample from La Reunion outbreak in 2005 as previously described (29Schuffenecker I. Iteman I. Michault A. Murri S. Frangeul L. Vaney M.C. Lavenir R. Pardigon N. Reynes J.M. Pettinelli F. Biscornet L. Diancourt L. Michel S. Duquerroy S. Guigon G. Frenkiel M.P. Brehin A.C. Cubito N. Despres P. Kunst F. Rey F.A. Zeller H. Brisse S. PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e263Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Virus was propagated twice in insect C6/36 cells, and supernatants were frozen at –80 °C and titrated (see below). Muscle cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 to 10–2 according to the experiments. Infection was performed for 2 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium before washing the cells twice with culture medium. For viral infections, immortalized cultures of human myoblasts were used. Immortalized cultured myoblasts consisted of a human myogenic cell line, called LHCN-M2, that had previously been obtained by introduction of human telomerase and cyclin-dependent protein kinase 4 (30Zhu C.H.

Cells were cultured in T25 flasks until confluence (7–10 days) before plating. Cells were cultivated in Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamycin and 20% fetal calf serum and trypsinized when confluence was reached before plating under the same conditions as above. Viral samples were titrated as TCID50/ml on Vero cells, as previously described (9Sourisseau M. Schilte C. Casartelli N. Trouillet C. Guivel-Benhassine F. Rudnicka D. Sol-Foulon N. Le Roux K.

Immunofluorescence—After infection/treatment of muscle cell cultures, samples were fixed at 15 h post-infection in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence using mouse hyperimmune ascitic fluids raised against CHIKV as previously described (7Ozden S. Huerre M. Riviere J.P. Coffey L.L. Afonso P.V. Mouly V. de Monredon J. Roger J.C. El Amrani M. Yvin J.L. Jaffar M.C. Frenkiel M.P. Sourisseau M. Schwartz O. Butler-Browne G. Despres P. Gessain A.

Western Blotting—Muscle cell cultures were infected (m.o.i. 0.1) for 2 h and washed with medium, and dec-RVKR-cmk or chloroquine (100 and 2 μm, respectively) was then added separately or together. Supernatants were harvested 16 h later, and lysis was performed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 120 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA supplemented with the Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture from Roche Applied Science. CHIKV E2 protein was detected in protein extracts using previously described anti-E2 monoclonal antibody (31Brehin A.C. Rubrecht L. Navarro-Sanchez M.E. Marechal V. Frenkiel M.P. Lapalud P. Laune D. Sall A.A. Despres P. Virology. 2008; 371: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and standard immunoblotting techniques. Peptide Synthesis and Kinetic Parameters—All intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic (IQF) peptides were synthesized by Fmoc-based solid phase chemistry using automated multipep peptide synthesizer instrument (Intavis, Germany). For efficient incorporation of two unnatural amino acids, namely Abz (2-aminobenzoic acid, a fluorescent moiety) and Tyx (3-nitrotyrosine, a fluorescence quench group), at the N and C termini of the peptide chain, a double coupling step was used. The crude peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and fully characterized by mass spectrometry (32Basak S. Mohottalage D. Basak A. Protein Pept. Lett. 2006; 13: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Enzyme digestions were conducted for 3 h with 20 μg of each peptide and recombinant soluble furin (New England Biolabs) and PC5A (enzyme activity ∼ 0.1–0.15 unit, where 1 unit represents 1 pmol of free amidomethylcoumarin released per min from 100 μm t-butoxycarbonyl-RVRR-amidomethylcoumarin substrate (33Decroly E.

To determine the site of peptide cleavage, each crude digest was examined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry as described (32Basak S. Mohottalage D. Basak A. Protein Pept. Lett. 2006; 13: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters Km and Vmax for each digestion were measured from intensity of fluorescence released as described earlier. Typically, recombinant furin or PC5A (2 ml, activity ∼0.1–0.15 units) was incubated for 4 h with increasing concentrations (1–20 mm) of each intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptide in 100 ml of buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris + 25 mm Mes + 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, in a 96-well microtiter plate at 37 °C. The rate of hydrolysis was obtained from the changes in fluorescence readings, and the values were transformed into fmol/h of peptide cleaved by using standard curve and quenching corrections (32Basak S. Mohottalage D. Basak A. Protein Pept. Lett. 2006; 13: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Data were collected in duplicate, and each value is the mean of three independent experiments. Vmax and Km were calculated as described (32Basak S. Mohottalage D. Basak A. Protein Pept. Lett. 2006; 13: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In Vitro Study of the Processing of the Furin-like Motif by the PCs—Comparison of different alphaviruses indicated the presence of a proprotein convertase motif in CHIKV E3E2 glycoprotein (Fig. 1) (17Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Isolates collected during the recent outbreak in La Réunion island (e.g. strain 05.115) exhibited a HRQRR64↓ST motif at the E3E2 junction (29Schuffenecker I. Iteman I. Michault A. Murri S. Frangeul L. Vaney M.C. Lavenir R. Pardigon N. Reynes J.M. Pettinelli F. Biscornet L. Diancourt L. Michel S. Duquerroy S. Guigon G. Frenkiel M.P. Brehin A.C. Cubito N. Despres P. Kunst F. Rey F.A. Zeller H. Brisse S. PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e263Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) like other CHIKV strains originating from Africa (S27, 37997, or LR2006 OPY1). Interestingly, strains originating from Asia (Nagpur 653496 and AF15561) exhibit the same RQRR64 consensus sequence but within a slightly different motif (RRQRR64↓SI) that fully match the optimal RXRR↓XI furin recognition sequence (17Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). To analyze CHIKV E3E2 cleavage by furin-like convertases, we first examined in vitro the processing of this motif by furin and a soluble isoform of PC5 known as PC5A (34Lusson J. Vieau D. Hamelin J. Day R. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6691-6695Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), both of which are well known to participate in the processing of various viral glycoproteins (17Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). For this, we selected two intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptides, one 14-mer (long) and the other 11-mer (short), that contain the same physiologically relevant RRQRR64↓SI cleavage site that characterizes CHIKV strains originating from Asia (Table 2). We also included two mutant derivatives where the important P1 Arg64 was substituted by Ala and a short form where the P2P1 Arg-Arg64 was replaced by Ala-Ala64 (Table 2). When incubated with recombinant furin or PC5A, both wild-type (wt) peptides were efficiently cleaved by furin and PC5A at the correct physiological site. As shown by MALDI-TOF mass spectrum (Fig. 2, A and B), the crude 3-h digest of Q-Asiatic-CHIKV-short wt peptide with furin exhibited two strong peaks at m/z 1075 and 741 due to the N-terminal fragment Abz-SPRRQRR-OH (calculated Mr = 1074) and C-terminal fragment SIKD-Tyx-A-CONH2 (calculated Mr = 739), respectively, with complete disappearance of the peak at m/z 1798 of the undigested peptide. This clearly suggested a cleavage at R64↓S by the PCs. An additional peak at m/z = 897 was also observed due to the formation of the fragment RSIKD-Tyx-A-CONH2 (calculated Mr = 896). This indicated another cleavage at QR63↓64RS site. When the mutant R64A peptide was incubated with PCs, again cleavage was observed but exclusively digested at QR63↓64AS, leading to peaks at m/z 920 and 811 for the N- and C-terminal fragments Abz-SPRRQR-OH (calculated Mr = 918) and ASIKD-Tyx-A-CONH2 (calculated Mr = 810), respectively, as shown for furin cleavage (Fig. 2, C and D). So far it is not clear whether both these secondary cleavage sites are relevant to CHIKV infection. The minute peak at m/z 1712 was due to the undigested peptide. But unlike the wt peptide, no additional cleavages were observed in this case, as expected. It may be further pointed out that when a P1P2 Ala double mutant peptide (Abz-319SPRRQAASIK328-Tyx-A) was similarly treated with the PCs, no cleavage was detectable in the mass spectra even after 18 h of incubation (not shown).TABLE 2List of peptides (wild type and mutant) from E3E2 junction of structural protein of the Asiatic strain of the CHIKV (Nagpur, 653496 strain)Peptide nameAmino acid sequenceMrQ-Asiatic-CHIKV-long wtFmoc-Abz-55LTCSPRRQRRSIKD68-Tyx-A2236Q-Asiatic-CHIKV-long mutAbz-55LTCSPRRQRASIKD68-Tyx-A2028Q-Asiatic-CHIKV-short wtAbz-58SPRRQRRSIKD68-Tyx-A1797Q-Asiatic-CHIKV-short mutAbz-58SPRRQRASIKD68-Tyx-A1712Q-Asiatic-CHIKV-short double mutAbz-58SPRRQAASIKD68-Tyx-A1627 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2E3E2 junction cleavage by convertases.

C and D, in contrast to wt peptide, Q-Asiatic-CHIKV-short mutant peptide Abz-SPRRQRASIKD-Tyx-A-CONH2 (Mr 1712) was cleaved by furin into Abz-SPRRQR-OH (NT2, Mr 918) + ASIKD-Tyx-A-CONH2 (CT2, Mr 811).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Measurement of the kinetic parameters Vmax and Km for cleavages of short wt and mutant peptides (Table 3) by furin and PC5A suggested that these PCs are potential host candidate enzymes for maturation of the Asiatic CHIKV E3E2. Mass spectrometric and Vmax/Km values showed that these PCs cleave the E3E2 protein at the physiological site and that furin is ∼3-fold more efficient than PC5A in cleaving the wt peptide. Data with mutant peptides further confirmed the above conclusion and also indicated that besides the major cleavage at Arg64↓, there is an additional cleavage at Arg63↓ as well. With the R64A mutant peptide we noted that the efficiency of cleavage by furin and PC5A is enhanced but still keeps the ∼3-fold faster rate with furin versus PC5A. In all cases the Michaelis-Menten curves showing the various cleavages confirmed that furin and PC5A are efficient PCs for the processing of the Asiatic CHIKV E3E2 surface glycoprotein (not shown).TABLE 3Kinetic parameters for in vitro digestion of various intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptides by furin and PC5AEnzymeVmaxKmVmax/KmVmax/Km Relativefmol.h-1μmolh-1 × 10-6Q-Asiatic-CHIKV-short wt peptide Furin35.02 ± 2.550.122 ± 0.024286.552.08 PC5A33.04 ± 3.200.30 ± 0.059111.960.81Q-Asiatic-CHIKV-short mut peptide Furin51.98 ± 4.580.036 ± 0.0081447.7027.7 PC5A9.38 ± 1.410.185 ± 0.007507.0979.7 Open table in a new tab Furin-like Convertases and the Processing of E3E2 Proprotein—We tested the ability of different proprotein convertases (the soluble PACE4 and PC5A, and membrane-bound furin, PC5B, PC7, and SKI-1) to cleave E3E2 proprotein when transiently expressed in HEK293 human cells.

Human development and health depend in many respects on the availability of long chain multiply unsaturated fatty acids of 20 or 22 carbons in length that contain up to 6 methylene-flanked cis-double bonds. These fatty acids are classified under the designation very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFAs). 2The abbreviations used are:VLCPUFAvery long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid(s)ARAarachidonic acidCLdiphosphatidylglycerolEPAeicosapentaenoic acidFAMEfatty acid methyl esterLPCATacyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferasePCphosphatidylcholinePEphosphatidylethanolaminePIphosphatidylinositolPSphosphatidylserineTAGtriacylglycerolRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidocsoctopine synthase. 2The abbreviations used are:VLCPUFAvery long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid(s)ARAarachidonic acidCLdiphosphatidylglycerolEPAeicosapentaenoic acidFAMEfatty acid methyl esterLPCATacyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferasePCphosphatidylcholinePEphosphatidylethanolaminePIphosphatidylinositolPSphosphatidylserineTAGtriacylglycerolRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidocsoctopine synthase. Nutritionally important VLCPUFAs include arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4Δ5,8,11,14), an ω6-fatty acid, and the ω3-fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5Δ5,8,11,14,17) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6Δ4,7,10,13,16,19). ω3-VLCPUFAs are of particular interest from a nutritional standpoint since the uptake of these fatty acids is considered to be low in Western diets (1Simopoulos A.P. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1991; 54: 438-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). ω3-VLCPUFAs have long been investigated for their importance during human fetal development and the formation and function of the central nervous system, brain, and retina. In addition to their structural functions in membranes, several medical studies indicate that ω3-fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and, therefore, might be useful in the management of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as cardiovascular disease, major depression, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, and psoriasis (2Simopoulos A.P. J. Am. Coll.

Whereas mammals, including humans, can convert the essential precursors ω6–18:2Δ9,12 or ω3–18:3Δ9,12,15 (α-linolenic acid) to VLCPUFAs, a considerable proportion of VLCPUFA has to be taken up directly as components of the diet (3Goyens P.L. Spilker M.E. Zock P.L. Katan M.B. Mensink R.P. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2006; 84: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring producers and sources of ω3-VLCPUFAs are microorganisms, including marine bacteria and microalgae. These organisms represent the starting point of the aquatic food chain by which VLCPUFAs ultimately accumulate in fish oils. At the moment the main source of ω3-VLCPUFAs for human consumption are fatty ocean fish, such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, or herring. Unfortunately, the increased demand for fish and fish oils has led to a depletion of fish stocks in vast ocean areas worldwide. Thus, as an exclusive source of VLCPUFAs, fish cannot cover the needs of a growing world population (4Hites R.A. Foran J.A. Schwager S.J. Knuth B.A. Hamilton M.C. Carpenter D.O. Environ. Sci. Technol. 2004; 38: 4945-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Altogether, the increasing interest to find alternative sources of ω3-VLCPUFAs has led to various attempts to produce ω3-VLCPUFAs via the biotechnological introduction of new biosynthetic pathways in plants, ultimately aiming for VLCPUFA-production in annual oilseeds, e.g. in rapeseed or linseed. VLCPUFA synthesis in transgenic plants established so far starts from the plant endogenous fatty acids ω6–18:2Δ9,12 or ω3–18:3Δ9,12,15 and requires two distinct catalytic activities, desaturases and elongases. Both activities work together in an alternating manner to establish the final product. Genes for the biosynthesis of VLCPUFAs have been isolated from organisms of different kingdoms (algae, amoeba, fungi, moss, and flowering plants) and have been characterized by heterologous expression in various model systems regarding the properties of the encoded enzymes. In recent years a range of tests was done to establish the biosynthesis of VLCPUFAs in plants by introducing a variety of different front-end desaturases and elongases (5Graham I.A. Larson T. Napier J.A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2007; 18: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6Napier J.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2007; 58: 295-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Two previous approaches are of particular relevance for the study presented here. First, the so called alternative pathway for the biosynthesis of VLCPUFAs was successfully tested in Arabidopsis leaves (7Qi B. Fraser T. Mugford S. Dobson G. Sayanova O. Butler J. Napier J.A. Stobart A.K. Lazarus C.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This pathway is based on the sequential action of a Δ9 elongase (from Isochrysis galbana) (8Qi B. Beaudoin F. Fraser T. Stobart A.K. Napier J.A. Lazarus C.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), a Δ8 desaturase (from Euglena gracilis) (9Wallis J.G. Browse J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and a Δ5 desaturase (from the fungus Mortierella alpina) (10Michaelson L.V. Lazarus C.M. Griffiths G. Napier J.A. Stobart A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19055-19059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The Δ9 elongase converts CoA-bound 18:2Δ9,12 and/or α-18:3 into 20:2Δ11:14 and/or 20:3Δ11,14,17, which could be further converted to ARA and EPA via lipid-bound Δ8 and Δ5 desaturation, respectively. In this fashion a rate-limiting Δ6-elongation step was avoided, and EPA accumulation of up to 3% of the leaf total lipid content of Arabidopsis thaliana was achieved. It must be noted, however, that leaf tissue is not oleogenic and that the fatty acids are directly incorporated into membrane lipids rather than stored as oils as is the case in seeds and as would be desirable for VLCPUFA production. Moreover, a crucial problem was observed. The Δ9-elongation products (20:2Δ11,14 and 20:3Δ11,14,17) accumulated to very high levels in the acyl-CoA pool of the transgenic Arabidopsis plants (11Sayanova O. Haslam R. Qi B. Lazarus C.M. Napier J.A. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1946-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), indicating an inefficient transfer of these non-native fatty acids out of the acyl-CoA pool. In the second approach the coexpression of Δ6 and Δ5 desaturases of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum with a Δ6 elongase from the moss Physcomitrella patens in linseed showed that the enzymes carried out Δ5 and Δ6 desaturation on lipid-bound substrates in the plant with a positional specificity for the sn-2 position of phosphatidylcholine (PC), whereas the Δ6 elongase preferred acyl-CoA-species as substrates (12Abbadi A. Domergue F. Bauer J. Napier J.A. Welti R. Zähringer U. Cirpus P. Heinz E. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2734-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 13Domergue F. Abbadi A. Ott C. Zank T.K. Zahringer U. Heinz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35115-35126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Comprehensive acyl-CoA and lipid analysis of the EPA-producing transgenic linseed plants demonstrated that production of VLCPUFAs in plants requires not only the interplay of desaturases and elongases but also the transfer of acyl groups from the PC pool into the CoA pool and vice versa. This transfer is very likely catalyzed by the enzymatic activity of an acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT). The LPCAT endogenous to linseed does not accept the newly formed Δ6-desaturated fatty acids, and thus, the Δ6-desaturated fatty acids accumulated to high levels. In brief, the back-and-forth trans-acylation of fatty acids between the PC and CoA pools by the action of LPCAT represents a rate-limiting factor for VLCPUFA production by this transgenic approach in linseed (12Abbadi A. Domergue F. Bauer J. Napier J.A. Welti R. Zähringer U. Cirpus P. Heinz E. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2734-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In the research mentioned as well as in several other studies, e.g. Refs. 14Wu G. Truksa M. Datla N. Vrinten P. Bauer J. Zank T. Cirpus P. Heinz E. Qiu X. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar and 15Kinney, A. J., Cahoon, E. B., Damude, H. G., Hitz, W. D., Liu, Z. B., and Kolar, C. W. (U. S., 2004) WO 2004/071467 A2Google Scholar, desaturases from various organisms were analyzed for their feasibility to produce VLCPUFAs. The accumulated evidence indicates that the front-end desaturases characterized from algae, fungi, and moss are lipid-dependent desaturases and accept glycerolipid-linked substrates. In contrast to these lipid-dependent desaturases, a number of mammalian front-end desaturases accept acyl-CoA species as substrates (16Tocher D.R. Leaver M.J. Hodgson P.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 73-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 17Okayasu T. Nagao M. Ishibashi T. Imai Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 206: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Sprecher H. Chen Q. Yin F.Q. Lipids. 1999; 34: 153-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, one acyl-CoA-dependent Δ6 desaturase from the microalga Ostreococcus tauri was identified (19Domergue F. Abbadi A. Zähringer U. Moreau H. Heinz E. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). From fatty acid analyses performed on microalgae like O. tauri, however, it could be concluded that further desaturases with a preference for acyl-CoA substrates can be isolated from those organisms. Such plant-like acyl-CoA-dependent enzymes with the correct substrate specificities may allow bypassing the rate-limiting transport and exchange of intermediates of VLCPUFA synthesis between lipid-bound desaturation in the PC pool and elongation steps in the acyl-CoA pool. Many vascular plants synthesize 18:2Δ9,12 and 18:3Δ9,12,15 in their seed oils but do not produce or incorporate VLCPUFAs with chain lengths above 18 carbon atoms or more than three double bonds into triacylglycerol (TAG). To produce the ω3-fatty acid, ω3–20:5Δ5,8,11,14,17 (EPA), in seed oils, it is necessary to introduce one additional elongation and two desaturation steps. To avoid the accumulation of ω6 byproducts of desaturation, the enzymes selected should be specific for ω3 substrates. A second known constraint to circumvent is the rate-limiting shuttling of fatty acids between PC and CoA pools observed by Abbadi et al. (12Abbadi A. Domergue F. Bauer J. Napier J.A. Welti R. Zähringer U. Cirpus P. Heinz E. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2734-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To contribute to a solution for these problems, we report on the isolation and characterization of acyl-CoA-dependent desaturases from the microalgae Mantoniella squamata and O. tauri. Using the new enzymes, an entirely acyl-CoA-dependent ω3-VLCPUFA biosynthetic pathway consisting of Δ6- and Δ5 desaturase enzymes was successfully established in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in seeds of A. thaliana plants. This modified pathway may allow a more efficient flux during VLCPUFA biosynthesis and avoids the bottleneck after Δ6 desaturation described by Abbadi et al. (12Abbadi A. Domergue F. Bauer J. Napier J.A. Welti R. Zähringer U. Cirpus P. Heinz E. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2734-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Materials—Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from MBI Fermentas. Standards of fatty acids as well as all other chemicals were from Sigma; methanol, n-hexane, and isopropanol (all high performance liquid chromatography grade) were from Baker. Fatty acids and acyl-CoAs were either obtained from Cayman Chemicals or Larodan. Basic molecular biological and biochemical techniques were performed as described (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R.E. Kingston D.D. Seidmann J.R. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates and John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). Algae Material and Growth Conditions—M. squamata SAG 65.90 (21Manton I. Parke M. Butcher. J. Marine Biol. Ass. UK. 1960; 39: 275-278Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was obtained from the algae culture collection Göttingen (SAG, Germany). O. tauri strain OTTH0595-genome was obtained from the Roscoff Culture Collection. Non-axenic cultures were grown in batch cultures under long daylight (14 h) conditions with 45 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 in 200 ml of Brackish Water Medium (1/2 SWES) complemented with soil extract at 20 °C. cDNA Library Construction and Random Sequencing of the cDNA Library—Total RNA from 7-day-old M. squamata cultures were isolated using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Poly A+ mRNAs were prepared using oligo-dT cellulose (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor NY1989Google Scholar) (see above) and reverse-transcribed via a reverse transcription kit (Promega) and then used for the construction of the cDNA library with a Lambda ZAP Gold library construction kit (Stratagene). After in vivo mass excision of the cDNA library, plasmid recovery and transformation of Escherichia coli (Stratagene), plasmid DNA was prepared on a Qiagen DNA preparation robot (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and submitted to random sequencing by the chain termination method using the ABI PRISM Big Dye Termination Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Analyses and annotations of the EST sequences between 100 and 500 base pairs resulted in a non-redundant EST data base. Data base screening of the cDNA library yielded two sequences that were annotated as putative desaturases. Isolation and Cloning of Desaturase Sequences—To obtain full-length cDNA sequences, the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique was used. Therefore, 5 μl of total RNA isolated from M. squamata were reverse-transcribed and ligated to adaptor-ligated double-stranded cDNA by using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (BD Bioscience). Adaptor-ligated double-stranded cDNA was used as template for 5′- and 3′-RACE PCRs to obtain the missing 5′-prime and 3′-prime ends of the coding sequences for several desaturases. For RACE reactions, gene-specific primers were designed from EST sequence information. Primers used in 5′- and 3′-RACE were as follows: for MsΔ6 (MsI) as 5′-RACE primer, 5′-CATCCGGGCGGCAGCGTCATCTTCTAC-3′, and as 3′-RACE primer, 5′-GGAGAAGAGGTGGTGGATGACCTGG-3′; for MsΔ5 (MsII) as 5′-RACE primer, 5′-CCGAGTGAGGGGAGTACGTGGCGGG-3′, and as 3′-RACE primer, 5′-CACTCTCCGGCGGGCTCAACTACC-3′. A 50-μl standard reaction contained 1× Advantage2 DNA polymerase buffer, 1 μl of Advantage 2 DNA Polymerase (BD Bioscience), 0.2 mm concentrations of each dNTP, 0.5 μm 5′ or 3′ primer, 0.5 μm adaptor primer 1 (AP1), and 5 μl of adaptor-ligated double-stranded cDNA. RACE-PCR amplification was performed as follows: 30 s at 94 °C; 5 cycles of 5 s at 94 °C, 4 min at 72 °C; 5 cycles of 5 s at 94 °C, 4 min at 70 °C; 20 cycles of 5 s at 94 °C, 4 min at 68 °C. Amplified products were isolated from agarose gels, purified using a gel extraction kit (GE Healthcare), and subsequently cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). Cloned inserts were sequenced using the ABI PRISM® 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Cloning cDNA for Desaturases into Yeast Expression Vectors—From the 5′- and/or 3′-cDNA sequence data obtained by RACE-PCR, the putative translation initiation codons and stop codons were identified, and this sequence information was used to obtain full-length cDNA clones of the putative desaturases from M. squamata. Gene-specific primers were designed to the 5′- and the 3′-ends of the coding regions of the corresponding nucleotide sequences, introducing restriction sites for cloning into the yeast expression vectors and the yeast consensus sequence for enhanced translation in front of the start codons (23Donahue T.F. Cigan A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 366-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The open reading frames of the MsΔ6 (MsI) and MsΔ5 (MsII) and of OtΔ5 (OtII) were amplified and modified by PCR. The following pairs of primers were used (restrictions sites are in bold, translation initiation sequences are in italics, and start or stop codons are underlined): for MsΔ6 as forward primer, 5′-ATGCGCGGCCGCACATAATGTGTCCTCCCAAGGAAT-3′, and as reverse primer 5′-ATGCAGATCTCTAGTGAGCGTGCGCCTTC-3′; for MsΔ5 as forward primer, 5′-ATGCGCGGCCGCACATAATGCCCCCGCGCGAGACCA-3′, and as reverse primer, 5′-ATGCAGATCTTCACCCGATGGTTTGAAGG-3′; and for OtΔ5 as forward primer, 5′-ATGCGCGGCCGCACATAATGGGGACGACCGCGCGCGAC-3′, and as reverse primer, 5′-ATGCAGATCTTCATCCGACGGTTTGGAGGGACGG-3′. The amplified cDNAs were cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) before being released and cloned into the yeast expression vector (pESC-LEU or pESC-TRP, respectively, Stratagene) using the restriction sites inserted by PCR, yielding pESC-LEU-MsΔ6 and pESC-TRP-MsΔ5. For comparison with the known front-end desaturases from P. tricornutum, PtΔ6 and PtΔ5, or with the known acyl-CoA-dependent front-end desaturase from O. tauri, OtΔ6, the P. tricornutum or O. tauri cDNA clones were cloned into yeast expression vectors as described for the M. squamata desaturases, yielding pESC-LEU-PtΔ6-PSE1 and pESC-TRP-PtΔ5 using the primers (restrictions sites are in bold; start or stop codons are underlined): for OtΔ6 as forward primer, 5′-ATGCGCGGCCGCACATAATGTGCGTGGAGACGGAAAAT-3′, and as reverse primer, 5′-ATGCAGATCTTTACGCCGTCTTTCCGGAGTGT-3′; for PtΔ6 as forward primer, 5′-ATGCGCGGCCGCACATAATGGGCAAAGGAGGGGACGC-3′, and as reverse primer, 5′-ATGCAGATCTTTACATGGCGGGTCCATGCG-3′; for PtΔ5 as forward primer, 5′-ATGCGCGGCCGCACATAATGGCTCCGGATGCGGATAAG-3′, and as reverse primer, 5′-ATGCAGATCTTTACGCCCGTCCGGTCAAGGG-3′. To obtain pESC-LEU-MsΔ6-PSE1, pESC-LEU-OtΔ6-PSE1, and pESC-LEU-PtΔ6-PSE1, the Δ6 elongase from P. patens, PSE1 (24Zank T.K. Zahringer U. Beckmann C. Pohnert G. Boland W. Holtorf H. Reski R. Lerchl J. Heinz E. Plant J. 2002; 31: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), was cloned into the yeast expression vector. Primers used to amplify PSE1: the forward primer was 5′-AGTCGGATCCTATGGAGGTCGTGGAGAGAT-3′; the reverse primer was 5′-ATGCGCTAGCTCACTCAGTTTTAGCTCCCTT-3′. The Δ5 elongase from O. tauri, OtELO2 (25Meyer A. Kirsch H. Domergue F. Abbadi A. Sperling P. Bauer J. Cirpus P. Zank T.K. Moreau H. Roscoe T.J. Zahringer U. Heinz E. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1899-1909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), was cloned in the yeast expression vector pESC-URA. The primers used to amplify OtELO2 were as forward primer, 5′-ATGCGGATCCATGAGCGCCTCCGGTGCGCTGCTGCC-3′, and as reverse primer, 5′-ATGCGCTAGCTTAGTCAATTTTTCGAGATCG-3′. Cloning and Vector Construction for Production of Transgenic Arabidopsis Plants—Plasmids for plant transformation were constructed based on the vector pUC19. For the generation of the constructs, a triple cassette containing three seed-specific USP promoters (26Bäumlein H. Boerjan W. Nagy I. Bassuner R. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Wobus U. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 225: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), three OCS terminators, and three different polylinkers between each promoter and terminator was first introduced to the vector pUC19 (Pharmacia Corp.), yielding the USP123OCS plasmid. The open reading frames of the different desaturases and elongases were modified by PCR to create appropriate restriction sites adjacent to the start and stop codons, cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced to confirm their accuracy. The primers used were (restrictions sites are in bold, and start or stop codons are underlined): MsΔ6, forward, 5′-ATGCGCGGCCGCACATAATGTGTCCTCCCAAGGAAT-3′, reverse, 5′ATGCTCTAGACTAGTGAGCGTGCGCCTTC-3′; MsΔ5, forward, 5′-ATGCCCATGGACATAATGCCCCCGCGCGAGACCACCAC-3′, reverse, 5′-ATGCACCGGTTCACCCGATGGTTTGAAGGC-3′; OtΔ6, forward, 5′-ATGCGCGGCCGCACATAATGTGCGTGGAGACGGAAAAT-3′, reverse, 5′-ATGCTCTAGATTACGCCGTCTTTCCGGAGTGT-3′; OtΔ5, forward, 5′-ATGCCCATGGACATAATGTGGACGCCCGCGCGCGA-3′, reverse, 5′-ATGCACCGGTTCATCCGACGGTTTGGAGGG-3′; PtΔ6, forward, 5′-ATGCGCGGCCGCACATAATGGGCAAA GGAGGGGACGC-3′, reverse, 5′-ATGCTCTAGATTACATGGCGGGTCCATCGCGTA-3′; PtΔ5, forward, 5′-ATGCCCATGGACATAATGGCTCCGGATGCGGATAAGC-3′, reverse, 5′-ATGCGCGATCGCTTACGCCCGTCCGGTCAA-3′, PSE1, forward, 5′-AGTCGGATCCTATGGAGGTCGTGGAGAGAT-3′, reverse, 5′-ATGCGCTAGCTCACTCAGTTTTAGCTCCCTT-3′. The open reading frames were then released using the restriction sites created by PCR and successively inserted into the same sites of the polylinkers of the USP123OCS plasmid. The resulting cassette, containing the three genes each under the control of the USP promoter, was released by digesting the USP123OCS plasmid with SbfI or SacI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the binary vector pCAMBIA3300 yielding the constructs triple-Ms, triple-Ot, and triple-Pt. The binary vector pCAMBIA3300 (CAMBIA) uses the bar gene with the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter as a selectable marker in plants. The binary plasmid constructs were transformed into chemically competent Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells (strain EH105). Expression in S. cerevisiae—S. cerevisiae cells strain INVSc1 (Invitrogen) were transformed as described (27Hornung E. Korfei M. Pernstich C. Struss A. Kindl H. Fulda M. Feussner I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1686: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For induction, expression cultures were grown for 48 h to 72 h at 22 °C in the presence of 2% (w/v) galactose supplemented with 150–350 μm concentrations of appropriate fatty acid substrate and in the presence of 1% Igepal CA 630 (Nonidet P-40) from Sigma-Aldrich. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1200 × g for 5 min, and the pellets were washed twice with H2O before being used for further analysis. The host strain transformed with the empty vector(s) was used as negative control in all experiments. Arabidopsis Transformation—A. thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) plants were transformed by floral dipping (37Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T2 seeds were collected from individual T1 plants resistant to ammonium glufosinate and analyzed individually by GC. Fatty Acid Analysis—Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were obtained by methylation of microalgae or yeast cell sediments with 0.5 m sulfuric acid in methanol containing 2% (v/v) dimethoxypropane at 80 °C for 1 h. FAMEs were extracted in 2 ml of n-hexane, dried under N2, and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). FAMEs of single or pooled Arabidopsis seeds were prepared by transesterification with trimethylsulfonium hydroxide (28Butte W. Reimann H.H. Walle A.J. Clin. Chem. 1982; 28: 1778-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). FAMEs of TLC-separated individual lipids were obtained by transmethylation with 333 μl of toluol/methanol (1:2 v/v) and 167 μl of 0.5 m NaOCH3 at room temperature for 20 min. FAMEs were extracted in 500 μl of NaCl, 50 μl of HCl (37%), and 2 ml of n-hexane, dried under N2, and analyzed by GC. The GC analysis was performed with an Agilent GC 6890 system coupled with a flame ionization detector equipped with a capillary 122-2332 DB-23 column (30 m × 0.32 mm; 0.5 μm coating thickness; Agilent). Helium was used as carrier gas (1 ml min–1). Samples were injected at 220 °C. The temperature gradient was 150 °C for 1 min, 150 to 200 °C at 15 °C min–1, 200 to 250 °C at 2 °C min–1, and 250 °C for 10 min. Data were processed using the HP ChemStation Rev. A09.03. FAMEs were identified by comparison with appropriate reference substances. Lipid Analysis—For lipids analysis expression has been carried out with 50-ml cultures. Harvested cell pellets were homogenized in 5 ml of chloroform/methanol 1:2 (v/v), and lipids were extracted on a shaker for 4 h and then for 20 h with 5 ml of chloroform/methanol 2:1 (v/v) at 4 °C. The resulting organic phases were combined and dried under N2. The remaining lipids were dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform. Separation of lipid classes (neutral lipids and phospholipids) was achieved using a silica column (Bond Elut SI, 100 mg/ml; Varian). Lipid extracts were loaded on the silica column pre-equilibrated with chloroform and then fractionated into the lipid classes by elution as follows; neutral lipids with chloroform and phospholipids with methanol/glacial acetic acid (9:1. v/v). Isolation of individual components of the phospholipid class was achieved by thin layer chromatography using appropriate standards and with methanol/chloroform/glacial acetic acid (25:65:8, v/v) as developing solvent. Lipid Analysis of Arabidopsis Seeds—For lipid analysis, 10 mg of seeds were homogenized in 4 ml of chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid (2:1:0.1 v/v/v) and incubated for 24 h at 4 °C. Seed residues were pelleted (2 min, 3000 × g). The supernatant was collected, and the pelleted seed residues were incubated with 2 ml of n-hexane for 30 min at room temperature. The resulting organic phases were combined and dried under N2. The dried lipids were dissolved in 200 μl of chloroform. Separation of lipid classes (TAG and"

For instance, CXCL12 has been shown to mediate human immunodeficiency virus-induced neurotoxicity, proliferative retinopathy and chronic inflammation, whereas its receptor CXCR4 is involved in human immunodeficiency virus infection, cancer metastasis and in the rare disease known as the warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, immunodeficiency, and myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome. As we screened chemical libraries to find inhibitors of the interaction between CXCL12 and the receptor CXCR4, we identified synthetic compounds from the family of chalcones that reduce binding of CXCL12 to CXCR4, inhibit calcium responses mediated by the receptor, and prevent CXCR4 internalization in response to CXCL12. We found that the chemical compounds display an original mechanism of action as they bind to the chemokine but not to CXCR4. The highest affinity molecule blocked chemotaxis of human peripheral blood lymphocytes ex vivo. It was also active in vivo in a mouse model of allergic eosinophilic airway inflammation in which we detected inhibition of the inflammatory infiltrate. The compound showed selectivity for CXCL12 and not for CCL5 and CXCL8 chemokines and blocked CXCL12 binding to its second receptor, CXCR7. By analogy to the effect of neutralizing antibodies, this molecule behaves as a small organic neutralizing compound that may prove to have valuable pharmacological and therapeutic potential.

Chemokines are small (8–10-kDa) secreted proteins that play roles in the normal physiology of the immune system as well as in orchestrating leukocyte recruitment and activation in the context of inflammatory and infectious diseases (1Fernandez E.J. Lolis E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 469-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Most of them belong to one of two major subfamilies: the β or CC chemokines in which two conserved cysteines from the amino terminus are adjacent to each other and the α or CXC chemokines in which these two cysteines are separated by one residue. Chemokine receptors are members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors characterized by seven transmembrane-spanning regions and coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins.

CXCL12 stimulates a rapid receptor-mediated intracellular calcium mobilization and signaling through a Pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi protein.

Also inherited heterozygous autosomal dominant mutations of the CXCR4 gene, which result in the truncation of the carboxyl terminus (C-tail) of the receptor, are associated with the rare disease known as the warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, immunodeficiency, and myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome (10Hernandez P.A.

Considering both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the involvement of the CXCR4/CXCL12 pair in the above mentioned physiological and pathological functions on the one hand and the limited number of pharmacological tools to investigate their function or to correct for defects in their functioning, we set up a screening program to identify new molecules interfering with the binding of CXCL12 to the receptor CXCR4. Here we describe the discovery of a new class of pharmacologically active molecules that bind to the chemokine itself and neutralize its biological activity in a way similar to that of neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies and Reagents—All antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. Chalcone and baicalin stock solutions were prepared in sterile DMSO and then stored at -20 °C before use. The human chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL12-Texas Red were synthesized as described previously (13Amara A. Lorthioir O. Valenzuela A. Magerus A. Thelen M. Montes M. Virelizier J.L. Delepierre M. Baleux F.

The strategy used for the introduction of the Texas Red molecule was the same as for the biotin molecule.

The human chemokines CCL5 and CXCL8 were purchased from BD Biosciences. Chemical Library Screening—The collection of 3,200 screened molecules was taken from the Chemical Library of the School of Pharmacy of Strasbourg (Institut Fédératif de Recherche 85). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the fusion receptor EGFP-hCXCR4 (14Valenzuela-Fernandez A. Palanche T. Amara A. Magerus A. Altmeyer R. Delaunay T. Virelizier J.L. Baleux F. Galzi J.L.

Cells were distributed (75 000 cells/70 μl/well) into 96-half-well polystyrene plates (Cliniplates, Thermo Labsystems) previously filled (2 μl/well) with fluorescent CXCL12 (100 nm final concentration) and a molecule from the chemical library (20 μm final concentration). After 15 min at room temperature, fluorescence of cells was recorded at 510 nm (excitation at 465 nm) using a multilabel counter (Victor 2, BD Biosciences). Hit compounds were confirmed by repeating the experiment. Real Time Fluorescence Monitoring of Ligand-Receptor Interactions—Experiments were performed on cells stably expressing the EGFP-CXCR4 receptor suspended in Hepes-bovine serum albumin buffer (typically at 106 cells/ml). Time-based recordings of the fluorescence emitted at 510 nm (excitation at 470 nm) were performed at 21 °C using a spectrofluorometer and sampled every 0.3 s. Fluorescence binding measurements were initiated by adding at 30 s 100 nm CXCL12-Texas Red to the 1-ml cell suspension. For competition experiments, EGFP-CXCR4-expressing cells were preincubated for 5 min in the absence or presence of various concentrations of unlabeled drugs. Then CXCL12-Texas Red (100 nm) was added, and fluorescence was recorded until equilibrium was reached (300 s). Data were analyzed using Kaleidagraph 3.08 software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Intracellular Ca2+ Release Measurement—Intracellular Ca2+ release measurement was carried out as described previously (15Palanche T. Ilien B. Zoffmann S. Reck M.P. Bucher B. Edelstein S.J. Galzi J.L.

CXCR4 staining was quantified by flow cytometric analysis (10,000 cells/sample) on a cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). The mean of CXCR4 fluorescence intensity was calculated using CellQuest (BD Biosciences) software. Chemotaxis Assays—CD4+ T lymphocytes were isolated from fresh blood samples of healthy volunteers as described previously (18Balabanian K. Harriague J. Decrion C. Lagane B. Shorte S. Baleux F.

The fraction of transmigrated T cells was calculated as follows: ((number of T cells migrating to the lower chamber)/(number of T cells added to the upper chamber at the start of the assay)) × 100.

The incubation of increasing concentrations of chalcone 4 with CXCL12-biot was made in the binding buffer during 1 h at room temperature before addition to cell suspension. Untagged CXCL12 was used at 1 μm as a control in the competition experiments. Tryptophan Fluorescence Assay—Binding of chalcone 4 and chalcone 1 to CXCL12 was examined by monitoring changes in the emission intensity of intrinsic Trp fluorescence of the chemokine. Increasing amounts of molecule were added to CXCL12 protein (2 μm in Hepes buffer without bovine serum albumin in a 1-ml quartz microcuvette. Fluorescence measurements were carried out in triplicate using a Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin-Yvon/Spex). The excitation wavelength was set to 295 nm, and emission was collected from 310 to 400 nm. All solutions were thermostated at 20 °C and continuously stirred using a small magnetic bar. All fluorescence emission spectra were corrected for the Raman peak by subtracting the emission scan of the buffer alone. Solubility Measurements—Solubility measurements of chalcones 1 and 4 were done by dissolving the compounds up to saturation in solutions of CXCL12 prepared in the following buffer: Tris 50 mm (pH = 8), NaCl 200 mm, CaCl2 1 mm, imidazole 10 mm. For each chalcone, the maximal solubility was measured in four solutions containing 0, 312, 625, and 1000 μm CXCL12. Samples were shaken for 24 h at 20–22 °C, and for each solution, the saturation was confirmed by the presence of undissolved chalcone in excess. After ultracentrifugation (Sorvall Discovery M120 SE ultracentrifuge with S45-A rotor centrifuged at 40,000 rpm), the concentration in the supernatant solution was determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The measurements were done using a Gilson HPLC chain with a UV detector set at 280 nm and a Rheodyne injector with a 50-μl loop. Data acquisition and processing were performed with Unipoint software version 1.71. The reverse phase measurements were carried out at room temperature on a 5-μm Luna C18(2) Phenomenex column (150 × 4.6 mm). The aqueous mobile phase contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A). The organic phase was HPLC grade acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich CHROMASOLV) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent B). The mobile phase flow rate was 1 ml/min, and the following program was applied for the elution: 0–2.5 min, 0% B; 2.5–17 min, 0–100% B; 17–21 min, 100% B; 21–24.50 min, 100–0% B; and 24.50–30 min, 0% B. Standard stock solutions of chalcones 1 and 4 at a 1 mm concentration were prepared by dissolving molecules in DMSO. To establish external calibration curves, four different concentrations in the range of 10–400 μm were prepared from standard stock solutions. The chromatograms were recorded by injecting 50 μl of each standard solution, and the calibration curves were plotted using peak areas and concentrations. The retention times for chalcones 1 and 4 were 17.3 and 16.5 min, respectively. 50 μl were injected for the eight saturated solutions. The solutions with 625 and 1000 μm CXCL12 had to be diluted before HPLC analysis because their chalcone concentrations were beyond the calibration ranges. Isothermal Titration Microcalorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements were carried out at 25.0 °C using a VP-ITC (MicroCal) titration calorimeter. All solutions were thoroughly degassed before use by stirring under vacuum. The sample cell was loaded with 1.4 ml of 1 μm CXCL12 in 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl buffer, pH 7.5, and the reference cell contained distilled water. Titration was carried out using a 300-μl syringe filled with 0.2 mm chalcone at 10% DMSO in Hepes/KCl buffer with stirring at 300 rpm. Injections were started after base-line stability had been achieved. A titration experiment consisted of 15 consecutive injections of 2-μl volume and 6.8-s duration for each with a 4-min interval between injections. The heat of dilution was measured by injecting chalcone into buffer solution without protein. The enthalpy change for each injection was calculated by integrating the area under the peaks of recorded time course of power change and then subtracting that from the control titration. Data were analyzed using MicroCal Origin software with equations corresponding to sets of identical sites and to sets of independent sites. Mouse Model of Allergic Eosinophilic Airway Inflammation—The protocol used BALB/c mice (9 weeks; Charles River, Saint-Germain-sur-l'Arbresle, France) according Ref. 20Delayre-Orthez C.

Briefly mice were sensitized on days 1 and 7 by intraperitoneal injections of 50 μg of ovalbumin + 2 mg of Al(OH)3 in saline (phosphate-buffered saline) and challenged on days 18–21 by ovalbumin (10 μg intranasally, 12.5 μl/nostril). Chalcone 4 (350 μmol/kg intraperitoneally) or vehicle (1% carboxymethylcellulose) was administered 2 h before each ovalbumin challenge. On day 22, the lungs were lavaged (10 × 0.5 ml of saline-EDTA). The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was centrifuged to pellet cells, and erythrocytes were lysed by hypotonic shock. Cells were resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold saline-EDTA. Total and differential cell counts were determined after cytocentrifugation of 50,000 cells/slide and Hemacolor (Merck) staining. At least 400 cells were counted and identified as macrophages, eosinophils, lymphocytes, or neutrophils expressed as an absolute number from the total cell count. Modeling of SDF1-Chalcone 4 Complex Three-dimensional Structure—The 5.26 release of the Cambridge Structural Database (21Taylor R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was searched to retrieve the crystal structures of chemically similar compounds. The naked chalcone scaffold of chalcone 4 was used as Conquest query. The 2006 release of the screening Protein Data Bank (22Kellenberger E. Muller P. Schalon C. Bret G. Foata N. Rognan D. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2006; 46: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) was searched to retrieve the crystal structure of chalcone 4 chemical analogs bound to protein. The three-dimensional structure of 2′,4,4′-trihydroxychalcone in complex with the chalcone o-methyltransferase (Protein Data Bank code 1FP1) was edited in Sybyl (Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO) to generate chalcone 4 coordinates stored in the MOL2 file. Hydrogens were added according to the Jchem (ChemAxon Kft., Budapest, Hungary) preferred tautomer at physiological pH. A few rotameric states were modified in the monomeric structure of CXCL12 (Protein Data Bank code 1VMC) to enlarge the existing cleft at the dimer interface. The largest changes concerned Leu-26 (χ1 moved from gauche- to gauche+, and χ2 moved from trans to gauche+), Ile-58 (χ1 moved from gauche- to gauche+), Tyr-61 (χ2 moved from gauche+ to gauche-), and Leu-62 (χ1 moved from gauche- to trans, and χ2 moved from trans to gauche+). The protein structure was energy-minimized using Sybyl (default settings) and served as the target for chalcone 4 docking. Docking experiments were carried out using Gold (Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, Cambridge, UK). Generic algorithm default parameters were set, and the Goldscore scoring function was chosen. The protein site was defined with a radius of 10 Å around a point in the center of the cavity. Two distance restraints of 1.5–4.5 Å with a spring constant of 5 were set between the halogen atom of the chalcone 4 chlorophenyl moiety and Ile-51 and Trp-57 side chains. The chalcone 4 best pose was manually edited to solvent expose the ligand carbonyl group (which was buried in the hydrophobic region of the protein) and to fix unrealistic torsion angles around the vinyl group. The optimized complex between SDF1 and chalcone 4 was further energy-minimized using Sybyl (default settings). Searching for Small Compounds That Could Inhibit the Interaction of the Chemokine CXCL12 with Its CXCR4 Receptor—We screened 3,200 molecules from the collection of the medicinal chemistry laboratories from Strasbourg University in a fluorescent binding assay on whole living cells described previously (14Valenzuela-Fernandez A. Palanche T. Amara A. Magerus A. Altmeyer R. Delaunay T. Virelizier J.L. Baleux F. Galzi J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Biol.

Briefly the CXCR4 receptor was stably transfected in human embryonic kidney cells as a fusion protein with EGFP fused to the extracellular amino-terminal part of the receptor (EGFP-CXCR4), and the chemokine CXCL12 was covalently labeled with the fluorophore Texas Red. Association with fluorescent CXCL12 was detected as a decrease of EGFP fluorescence emission that results from energy transfer to the Texas Red group of CXCL12 (Fig. 1A). CXCL12 binding saturation was reached at concentrations beyond 300 nm, and the dissociation constant of fluorescent CXCL12 for the CXCR4 receptor is 55 ± 15 nm (Ref. 14Valenzuela-Fernandez A. Palanche T. Amara A. Magerus A. Altmeyer R. Delaunay T. Virelizier J.L. Baleux F. Galzi J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Biol.

Unlabeled molecules competing with fluorescent CXCL12 prevented the decrease of EGFP emission as a function of receptor sites occupancy as is illustrated in Fig. 1A. The detected variation of fluorescence intensity can be quantified (15Palanche T. Ilien B. Zoffmann S. Reck M.P. Bucher B. Edelstein S.J. Galzi J.L. J. Biol.

The collection of small organic molecules from the academic medicinal chemistry laboratories of Strasbourg University is of relatively small size but exhibits important chemical diversity (24Krier M. Bret G. Rognan D. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2006; 46: 512-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Screening of this collection to find inhibitors of the interaction of CXCL12 with the CXCR4 receptor led to the identification of molecules with a fairly high rate of hit identification (2.5%) and confirmation (10% of hits). Chalcone 4 Inhibits Binding of CXCL12 to CXCR4—About 80 hit compounds were identified in the chemical library as capable, at 10 μm, of inhibiting more than 30% of fluorescent CXCL12 binding to CXCR4. Of these, seven molecules were potent inhibitors of CXCL12 binding because they were still active at a concentration of 1 μm. The most potent compound emerging from confirmed hit molecules belongs to the family of chalcones (Table 1); the remainder of hit compounds exhibited IC50 values beyond 20 μm and belong either to the chalcone group or to another chemical class, the triazines (to be described elsewhere). In the group of chalcones, three molecules, namely chalcone 2, chalcone 3, and chalcone 4, are analogs of the low affinity chemical platform chalcone 1 that is devoid of side chains (IC50 > 500 μm). As the two aromatic rings progressively become more substituted (chalcone 2, chalcone 3, and chalcone 4), the dissociation constants incrementally decreased to reach a submicromolar value (IC50 = 150 ± 50 nm for chalcone 4; see Fig. 1A for an example of the inhibition of the association of CXCL12 to its receptor by chalcone 4). The structure-activity relationship that we observed points to the importance of substitution of ring A by the chloride atom at position 4′ and to the simultaneous substitutions at positions 3 and 4 of ring B (data not shown). The affinity of chalcone 4 is only 1 order of magnitude lower than that of the reference competitive antagonist peptide T134 (25Tamamura H. Omagari A. Oishi S. Kanamoto T. Yamamoto N. Peiper S.C. Nakashima H. Otaka A. Fujii N. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000; 10: 2633-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B and Table 1). The unsubstituted platform chalcone 1 is also present in the collection. However, because of its very weak affinity, the molecule was not identified as a hit compound.TABLE 1Binding inhibition constants of chalcones IC50 values of chalcones and reference peptide T134 (14-mer, DK = d-Lys; Ci = l-citrulline) (30Li B.Q.

Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) were determined as values leading to 50% inhibition of CXCL12-TR binding to EGFP-CXCR4 receptor. Each value is a mean ± S.D. of three independent determinations carried out in duplicate. Open table in a new tab Chalcone 4 Inhibits CXCL12-evoked Calcium Cellular Responses—The next step toward pharmacological characterization of the most potent compound, chalcone 4, consisted in determining its effects on CXCR4-mediated cellular responses. Chalcone 4 by itself did not induce any calcium response (data not shown). Fig. 1C shows that chalcone 4 inhibited CXCL12-evoked calcium responses in a dose-dependent manner and with an apparent inhibitory constant (210 ± 50 nm) that is in good agreement with its potency for inhibition of CXCL12 binding (Fig. 1B). Yet in contrast to the known competitive peptide T134 that fully blocks calcium signaling at high concentration (20 μm; data not shown), chalcone 4 did not block more than 60–70% of the response to 5 nm CXCL12. Maximal inhibition by chalcone 4 was not improved when preincubation duration with cells was increased from typically 30 s to 30 min, supporting our view that the mechanism of inhibition by chalcone 4 differs from that of peptide T134. Chalcone 4 Inhibits CXCL12-evoked CXCR4 Internalization—As an antagonist of CXCR4 responses, chalcone 4 also altered chemokine-induced receptor internalization (Fig. 1D). Receptor endocytosis was monitored on HEK cells expressing EGFP-CXCR4 and quantified by flow cytometry. Endocytosis was time-dependent and reached 55 ± 4% in 30 min when cells were exp"
https://openalex.org/W2015925750,"Type I myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is caused by a triplet repeat expansion in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the dystrophia myotonia protein kinase (DMPK) gene. Pathogenesis is closely linked with production of a toxic RNA from the mutant allele, which interferes with function of several RNA-binding proteins, including CUGBP1. Here we show that expression of a mutant DMPK 3'-UTR containing 960 CUG repeats is sufficient to increase expression and stability of an mRNA encoding the potent proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF). CUGBP1 specifically recognizes sequences within the TNF 3'-UTR that are dissimilar from its canonical UG-rich binding site. Depletion of CUGBP1 from mouse myoblasts results in increased abundance of TNF mRNA through stabilization of the transcript. Moreover, activation of the protein kinase C pathway by treatment with phorbol ester, which has been shown previously to result in CUGBP1 phosphorylation, also causes TNF mRNA stabilization. Our results suggest that the elevated serum TNF seen in DM1 patients may be derived from muscle where it is induced by expression of toxic DMPK RNA. Importantly, overexpression of this potent cytokine could contribute to the muscle wasting and insulin resistance that are characteristic of this debilitating disease."
https://openalex.org/W2137992110,"Mitotic progression is driven by proteolytic destruction of securin and cyclins. These proteins are labeled for destruction by an ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) known as the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C). The APC/C requires activators (Cdc20 or Cdh1) to efficiently recognize its substrates, which are specified by destruction (D box) and/or KEN box signals. The spindle assembly checkpoint responds to unattached kinetochores and to kinetochores lacking tension, both of which reflect incomplete biorientation of chromosomes, by delaying the onset of anaphase. It does this by inhibiting Cdc20-APC/C. Certain checkpoint proteins interact directly with Cdc20, but it remains unclear how the checkpoint acts to efficiently inhibit Cdc20-APC/C activity. In the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we find that the Mad3 and Mad2 spindle checkpoint proteins interact stably with the APC/C in mitosis. Mad3 contains two KEN boxes, conserved from yeast Mad3 to human BubR1, and mutation of either of these abrogates the spindle checkpoint. Strikingly, mutation of the N-terminal KEN box abolishes incorporation of Mad3 into the mitotic checkpoint complex (Mad3-Mad2-Slp1 in S. pombe, where Slp1 is the Cdc20 homolog that we will refer to as Cdc20 hereafter) and stable association of both Mad3 and Mad2 with the APC/C. Our findings demonstrate that this Mad3 KEN box is a critical mediator of Cdc20-APC/C inhibition, without which neither Mad3 nor Mad2 can associate with the APC/C or inhibit anaphase onset.

The SAC works by preventing activation of the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) known as the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C (5Peters J.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar)). In order for the APC/C to become active, it must interact with a transiently available activator; early in mitosis, this is Slp1/Cdc20, and later in mitosis and in G1, it switches to Ste9/Cdh1 (6Visintin R.

The Mad2 and Mad3/BubR1 checkpoint proteins bind to and inhibit Cdc20, but their molecular mechanism(s) of inhibition remain incompletely understood. They could act by simply sequestering the APC/C activator or by otherwise preventing processive polyubiquitination of mitotic APC/C substrates. The APC/C substrates that must be polyubiquitinated and destroyed for mitosis to be completed are securin (Cut2/Pds1) and cyclin (Cdc13/Clb2) (11Cohen-Fix O.

Current models of SAC mechanism highlight the role of Mad2 in Cdc20 inhibition. A stable kinetochore-bound Mad1-Mad2 complex recruits additional Mad2 molecules, which then become primed for Cdc20 binding and inhibition (21De Antoni A. Pearson C.G. Cimini D. Canman J.C. Sala V.

However, it is clear that the Mad3/BubR1 spindle checkpoint component also has a central role to play in Cdc20 inhibition (25Hardwick K.G. Johnston R.C. Smith D.L. Murray A.W. J.

In fission yeast, Mad3 is the only checkpoint protein required for the overexpression of Mad2 to induce a metaphase arrest (28Millband D.N. Hardwick K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2728-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), indicating that a Mad2-Cdc20 complex is insufficient for checkpoint arrest in vivo. In addition, it has been shown that the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC, typically Mad3/BubR1-Bub3-Mad2-Cdc20) is a far more potent inhibitor than Mad2 in vitro (26Sudakin V. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 30Fang G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Here we show that both Mad3 and Mad2 can stably interact with the APC/C during fission yeast mitosis. The Mad3-APC/C interaction is dependent on Cdc20 and Mad2. Mutation of an N-terminal Mad3 KEN box prevents stable Mad3-Cdc20 binding, as well as Mad3 and Mad2 binding to APC/C, and abrogates the spindle checkpoint. We demonstrate that the N-terminal Mad3 KEN box, which is conserved from yeast Mad3 to human BubR1, is a critical link required for the concerted actions of Mad3 and Mad2 in checkpoint inhibition of Cdc20-APC/C. Mitotic Arrests—Yeast strains are listed in Table 1. nda3-KM311(cs) cells were grown in rich medium (yeast extract plus supplements (YES)) at 30 °C to a density of 2 × 106 and then shifted to 18 °C for 8 h. For the viability assay, 200 cells were plated on YES and grown at 32 °C. For microscopy, cells were rapidly fixed in ice-cold 100% methanol and mounted with 1 mg/ml DAPI (Sigma). For pREP1-N70-K0, pREP3x-Mad2, and pREP41x-Mph1 overexpression arrests, precultures were grown in Schizosaccharomyces pombe minimal glutamate medium supplemented with 5 μm thiamine for 24 h. Cells were then washed twice with the same medium lacking thiamine, and fresh media were inoculated at 2 × 105/ml and incubated for 16–18 h (for Mad2 and Mph1) or 14–16 h (for N70-K0) at 30 °C.TABLE 1Yeast strainsKP135mad3Δ::ura4 ade6-210 leu1-32 ura4-D18KP361nda3-KM311 mad3-GFP::his3 leu1-32 ura4-D18YJB43mad3-GFP::his3 leu1-32 ura4-D18YJB122mad3-KEN20-GFP::his3 leu1-32 ura4-D18YJB84mad3-KEN271-GFP::his3 leu1-32 ura4-D18MS199slp1-HA::kanr ade6-210 leu1-32 ura4-D18 his3-D1 arg3-D4 pN70-K0MS234mad3-GFP::his3 leu1-32 ura4-D18 pN70-K0MS209slp1-HA::kanr mad3-GFP::his3 ade6-210 leu1-32 ura4-D18 his3-D1 pN70-K0MS207slp1-HA::kanr mad3-KEN20-GFP::his3 ade6-210 leu1-32 ura4-D18 his3-D1 pN70-K0MS208slp1-HA::kanr mad3-KEN271-GFP::his3 ade6-210 leu1-32 ura4-D18 his3-D1 pN70-K0MS196lid1-TAP::kanr mad3-GFP::his3 leu1-32 ade6-210 pN70-K0MS202lid1-TAP::kanr mad3-KEN20-GFP::his3 leu1-32 ade6-210 pN70-K0MS203lid1-TAP::kanr mad3-KEN271-GFP::his3 leu1-32 ade6-210 pN70-K0MS201lid1-TAP::kanr mad3-KEN20/271-GFP::his3 leu1-32 ade6-210 pN70-K0MS221lid1-TAP::kanr mad3-GFP::his3 mad2::ura4 leu1-32 ade6-210 pN70-K0MS222lid1-TAP::kanr mad3-GFP::his3 bub3::ura4 leu1-32 ade6-210 pN70-K0MS254lid1-TAP::kanr mad3-GFP::his3 slp1-362 leu1-32 ade6-210MS186lid1-TAP::kanr mad3-GFP::his3 mts3-1 leu1-32 ade6-210MS182lid1-TAP::kanr mad3-KEN20-GFP::his3 mts3-1 leu1-32 ade6-210MS187lid1-TAP::kanr mad3-KEN271-GFP::his3 mts3-1 leu1-32 ade6-210MS194lid1-TAP::kanr mad3-KEN20/271-GFP::his3 mts3-1 leu1-32 ade6-210MS215slp1-HA:: kanr mad3-GFP::his3 bub3::ura4 leu1-32 ade6-210 pN70-K0MS284slp1-HA:: kanr mad3-GFP::his3 mad1::ura4 leu1-32 ade6-210 pN70-K0MS291slp1-HA:: kanr mad3-GFP::his3 mph1::natr, leu1-32, ade6-210 pN70-K0MS292slp1-HA:: kanr mad3-GFP::his3 bub1::ura4 leu1-32 ade6-210 pN70-K0KMY438nda3-KM311 mad3::ura4 leu1-32 ura4-D18KMY419nda3-KM311 mad3-KEN20AAA-GFP::his3 leu1-32 ura4-D18KMY446nda3-KM311 mad3-KEN271AAA-GFP::his3 leu1-32 ura4-D18KGY2152lid1-TAP::kanr nda3-KM311 leu1-32 h-KGY6130nda3-KM311 lid1-Myc13 mad2-GFP h+KGY6186cdc25-22 lid1-Myc13 slp1-HA3 h-KGY6343mad3-TAP::kanr nda3-KM311 h-KGY7024mad2-HTB::kanr lid1-Myc13 nda3-KM311 ade6-M210 leu1-32 ura4-D18 h-KGY7104mad2-HTB::kanr lid1-Myc13 mts3-1 ade6-M210 leu1-32 ura4-D18 h- Open table in a new tab The cdc13 (cyclin B) construct used has all of the N70 lysines replaced with arginine (K0-N70), so as not to deplete cellular ubiquitin pools, and cells accumulate in metaphase when it is overproduced (35Yamano H. Tsurumi C. Gannon J. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This is because the D box of the overexpressed cyclin titrates out Cdc20-APC/C, and as a result, other substrates such as Cut2 (securin) are not ubiquitinated efficiently. Temperature-sensitive mutants were first cultured in YES overnight at 25 °C. slp1-362 cultures (with an A600 of 0.2–0.4) were shifted to their restrictive temperature of 36 °C for 3 h. Typically 200-ml cultures were used for these experiments. Immunoprecipitations—0.1 g of pellets of cells were resuspended in 300 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science) and LPC (10 mg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin, Roche Applied Science)) and bead-beaten with 0.5 mm of zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products) twice for 30 s. Extracts were clarified, and dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Protein A Dynabeads (Dynal) were preincubated with anti-GFP (Invitrogen) or anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) antibodies and washed twice (first wash, phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100; second wash, lysis buffer). For tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged strains, Dynabeads (Dynal) coupled to IgG were used. Immunoprecipitations were performed for 2 h at 4 °C and washed, and proteins were eluted from the beads by incubating for 15 min at room temperature with SDS sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels. Quantitative immunodepletion was carried out on Mad2 tagged at its endogenous locus with His6-TEV-biotin (HTB) (60Tagwerker C. Zhang H. Wang X. Larsen L.S. Lathrop R.H. Hatfield G.W. Auer B. Huang L. Kaiser P. Yeast. 2006; 23: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The amount of Mad2-HTB and Lid1-Myc13 in each lysate and brought down by beads was determined by immunoblotting and quantification on an Odyssey machine. Analysis of TAP Complexes by Mass Spectrometry—TAP complexes were isolated and analyzed using mass spectrometry as described previously (33Ohi M.D. Feoktistova A. Ren L. Yip C. Cheng Y. Chen J.S.

All tandem spectra were searched against the S. pombe protein data base using the SEQUEST algorithm and were then processed using CHIPS program (jointly developed by Vanderbilt University Mass Spectrometry Research Center and the University of Arizona). The following filter settings were used: Xcorr ≥ 1 for singly charged peptides; Xcorr ≥ 1.8 for doubly charged peptides; Xcorr ≥ 2.5 for triply charged peptides; and Sp ≥ 350 and Rsp ≤ 5 for peptides of all charge states. Sucrose Gradients—Cell extracts were made by grinding cells in liquid nitrogen with a pestle and mortar. Lysis buffer was 50 mm Hepes (7.6), 75 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science), LPC (10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin, Roche Applied Science), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Extracts were clarified by spinning at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. 100 μl of extract were then fractionated on 10–40% sucrose gradients by spinning at 55,000 rpm for 5 h at 4 °C ina Beckman TLS55 rotor. 100-μl fractions were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunostaining—10–20 ml of an overnight culture were fixed with –80 °C cold methanol and washed twice in PEM (100 mm PIPES, pH 7 (sodium salt), 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA), and cell walls were digested with 0.4 mg/ml Zymolyase (MP Biomedicals). Cells were then washed, blocked with Blotto (4% dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween) for 1 h, and incubated with TAT1 (mouse anti-tubulin) antibody (1:50) for 16 h (kindly provided by Keith Gull, Oxford, UK). Anti-mouse secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor – Molecular Probes) was used at 1:100 for 1 h. Mitotic spindles were visualized using an Intelligent Imaging Innovations Marianas microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200M, using a ×100 1.3NA objective lens), CoolSnap CCD, and Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Boulder, CO). 300 cells were counted for each sample. Cycloheximide Chase Experiments—To measure the rates of protein turnover during mitosis, 100 ml of S. pombe cultures were arrested using the pN70-K0 plasmid (35Yamano H. Tsurumi C. Gannon J. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A 10-ml sample was collected and centrifuged, and the pellet was frozen on dry ice. Next, cycloheximide was added to the remaining culture to a final concentration of 100 mg/ml to block new protein synthesis. 10-ml samples were collected at 5-, 10-, or 15-min intervals and centrifuged, and pellets were stored at –80 °C for further analysis. Protein extracts were prepared by ribolysing cells with zirconia-silica beads in SDS sample buffer. S. pombe APC/C Stably Interacts with Both Mad2 and Mad3—Our previous TAP of the APC/C from asynchronously growing S. pombe identified 13 core subunits (31Yoon H.J. Feoktistova A. Wolfe B.A. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Gould K.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 2048-2054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Using the TAP-tagged Lid1(Apc4) subunit, we purified APC/C from cells arrested in prometaphase using the nda3-KM311 cold-sensitive tubulin allele. The nda3-KM311 mutant has no microtubules at 18 °C and arrests with hypercondensed chromosomes due to spindle checkpoint activation (32Hiraoka Y. Toda T. Yanagida M. Cell. 1984; 39: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). All other APC/C subunits identified previously (31Yoon H.J. Feoktistova A. Wolfe B.A. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Gould K.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 2048-2054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) co-purified with Lid1, along with the Cdc20 activator (Fig. 1A). Strikingly, this mitotic APC/C also contained the Mad2 and Mad3 spindle checkpoint proteins. In a reverse experiment, Mad2, Cdc20, and all 13 core APC/C subunits were detected in a Mad3-TAP eluate purified from nda3 arrested cells. No Mad1 or Bub (budding uninhibited by benzimidazole) proteins were detected in these complexes. These results, which were confirmed by immunoprecipitation and blotting (Fig. 1B), indicate that both Mad2 and Mad3 can stably interact with the APC/C in S. pombe. The stable associations we detected by TAP and mass spectrometry allowed us to address the mechanism by which Mad2 and Mad3 interact with the core APC/C in S. pombe. Mad3 and Mad2 Interact with the APC/C Every Mitosis—We also found that Mad3 and Mad2 are stably associated with the APC/C in an mts3-1 mutant arrest (33Ohi M.D. Feoktistova A. Ren L. Yip C. Cheng Y. Chen J.S. Yoon H.J. Wall J.S. Huang Z. Penczek P.A. Gould K.L. Walz T. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 871-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). mts3-1 arrests in a metaphase-like state due to decreased proteasome activity and the stabilization of securin and cyclin B (34Gordon C. McGurk G. Wallace M. Hastie N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5704-5711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These cells are not sensitive to microtubule destabilizing agents, and components of the SAC do not accumulate on kinetochores in mts3-1 cells (data not shown). This shows that Mad3 and Mad2 associate with the APC/C in a mitotic arrest that is independent of spindle checkpoint signaling. This was confirmed by accumulating cells in mitosis through overexpression of the N-terminal 70 amino acids of S. pombe cyclin B that lacks lysines (N70-K0: see “Experimental Procedures”). N70-K0 competes with endogenous APC/C substrates (35Yamano H. Tsurumi C. Gannon J. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and cells accumulate in metaphase independently of spindle checkpoint action. We could reproducibly detect both Mad2 and Mad3 bound to APC/C in N70-K0-induced mitotic delays (see Figs. 3 and 4).FIGURE 4The mad3-KEN20AAA mutation abolishes MCC formation, whereas upstream checkpoint signaling components are not necessary. A, strains were arrested at metaphase through overexpression of the N terminus of cyclin (N70-K0), and arrests were scored by mitotic spindle staining. Mad3-GFP was immunoprecipitated from mitotic extracts, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted for Mad3, Cdc20/Slp1, and Mad2. B, the same strains were arrested, extracts were made, and Cdc20/Slp1-HA was immunoprecipitated and then immunoblotted for Cdc20/Slp1, Mad3-GFP, and Mad2. Note that the mad3-KEN20AAA mutation did not perturb Mad2-Cdc20 association. C, mutant strains (mad1, mad2, bub1, bub3, and mph1) were arrested at metaphase through overexpression of the N terminus of cyclin (N70-K0). The mitotic index was scored by mitotic spindle staining with anti-tubulin antibodies. Cdc20/Slp1-HA was immunoprecipitated from mitotic extracts, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted for Cdc20/Slp1-HA, Mad3-GFP, and Mad2. The first three lanes are loading controls, where 100, 50, and 25% of the wild-type (wt) (Mad3-GFP) sample were loaded for comparison. D, Lid1 pull downs (using IgG Dynabeads) were performed from N70-K0-arrested checkpoint mutants and immunoblotted for Lid1-TAP, Mad3-GFP, and Mad2. The mitotic index was scored by mitotic spindle staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the Mad protein-APC/C complex assembles and disassembles during every cell cycle, we used the cdc25 mutant to presynchronize cultures in G2. Cells were then released from the block point, and samples were taken at 15-min intervals. Mad2 was immunoprecipitated, and we looked for associated Cdc20 and APC/C proteins by immunoblotting. Mad2 was found to associate with the APC/C specifically during mitosis (Fig. 2A). Similarly, during an nda3 release time course, Lid1-Myc was detectable in a Mad2 immunoprecipitate up until the point of septation (Fig. 2B). Sucrose gradient fractionation was carried out of extracts made from nda3 arrested cells. Pools of Mad2, Mad3-GFP, and Cdc20/Slp1-HA were seen to co-fractionate with Lid1-TAP (Fig. 2C). To determine what fraction of the total APC/C pool associates with checkpoint proteins, we made extracts from nda3-KM311 and mts3-1 arrested cells, immunodepleted Mad2 tagged at its endogenous locus with HTB using magnetic streptavidin beads (Fig. 2D, left panels), and quantitatively analyzed the amount of Lid1 associated with the beads and in the supernatant (see “Experimental Procedures”). We found that up to 8% of the APC/C was co-depleted with Mad2 (Fig. 2D, right panel). Thus, the levels of checkpoint proteins associated with APC/C increase specifically in mitosis and are significant, with at least 5% of the core APC/C bound by Mad2. Mad3-KEN20, Cdc20, and Mad2 Mediate the Mad3-APC/C Interaction—How is the Mad3-APC/C interaction mediated? First, Mad3 interaction with the APC/C was observed to be dependent on Cdc20. The conditional cdc20 allele, slp1-362, arrests in a metaphase-like state because the mutant Slp1-362 protein is unable to bind the APC/C at restrictive temperature (36Matsumoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In a Lid1-TAP from this mutant, Slp1-362, Mad3, and Mad2 were all undetectable by mass spectrometry (33Ohi M.D. Feoktistova A. Ren L. Yip C. Cheng Y. Chen J.S. Yoon H.J. Wall J.S. Huang Z. Penczek P.A. Gould K.L. Walz T. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 871-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting confirmed these mass spectrometry results; Lid1-TAP pull downs from N70-K0-overproducing cells contained both Mad3 and Mad2, but the pull down from mitotic slp1-362 cells did not (Fig. 3A). We conclude that stable checkpoint protein interactions with the mitotic APC/C are Cdc20-dependent. Cdc20 recognizes destruction (D) boxes and KEN boxes of APC/C substrates. Sequence analysis of Mad3 from different organisms revealed two conserved KEN boxes (Fig. 3B). To study their potential role in mediating an interaction with Cdc20-APC/C, we made three mutants in which the KEN boxes were replaced by a triple alanine (AAA) substitution: mad3-KEN20AAA, mad3-KEN271AAA, and mad3-KEN20/271AAA. The mutant proteins are present at wild-type levels and can be recruited to kinetochores (Figs. 4 and 5), so mutation of these residues does not lead to gross changes in stability of the Mad3 protein or its localization. The mad3-KEN mutants were enriched in mitosis with N70-K0, Lid1-TAP was pulled down, and the associated Mad proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. The mad3-KEN20AAA mutant abolished Mad3, and importantly also Mad2, association with the APC/C, whereas the mad3-KEN271AAA mutant had little effect (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S1). As expected, the double KEN box mutant abolished APC/C binding. Very similar results were obtained using mad3-KEN mts3-1 mutants (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, Mad3- and Mad2-APC/C association is dependent on the highly conserved N-terminal KEN box that is found in Mad3 and BubR1. Mad2 interaction with the APC/C is most likely bridged by direct interaction with Cdc20 (9Kim S.H. Lin D.P. Matsumoto S. Kitazono A. Matsumoto T. Science. 1998; 279: 1045-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 10Hwang L.H. Lau L.F. Smith D.L. Mistrot C.A. Hardwick K.G. Hwang E.S. Amon A. Murray A.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1041-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To determine whether Mad3 requires Mad2 to stably bind the APC/C, we overproduced N70-K0 in mad2Δ cells so that they accumulate in mitosis, pulled down Lid1-TAP, and immunoblotted for Mad3-GFP. Mad3-APC/C binding was Mad2-dependent (Fig. 3D). Thus, Mad3 is dependent on its own N-terminal KEN box, Mad2, and Cdc20 for APC/C association. Unexpectedly, Mad2 is also dependent on the N-terminal Mad3 KEN box for stable APC/C association (Fig. 3C). Thus, Mad2 and Mad3 are inter-dependent for stable APC/C binding. KEN20 Mediates Cdc20 Binding and MCC Formation—Mad3 is part of the MCC, which in fission yeast is comprised exclusively of Mad3, Mad2, and Cdc20. In other organisms, Bub3 is also a component of the MCC. However, S. pombe Mad3 lacks the GLEBS motif that is necessary and sufficient for Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mad3 to bind Bub3 (37Larsen N.A. Al-Bassam J. Wei R.R. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1201-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, although Bub3 is important for the kinetochore targeting of Mad3 (28Millband D.N. Hardwick K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2728-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 38Vanoosthuyse V. Valsdottir R. Javerzat J.P. Hardwick K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9786-9801Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), Bub3 is not stably associated with either MCC or APC/C in fission yeast (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Due to the co-dependence of Mad2 and Mad3 for stable APC/C association, we considered the possibility that this stable association requires formation of the MCC. To test the importance of the Mad3 KEN boxes for MCC formation, we enriched for mitotic wild-type and KEN mutant cells in mitosis using N70. We then carried out immunoprecipitations of Mad3-GFP and Cdc20/Slp1-HA from these mitotic extracts and found that mutation of the N-terminal KEN box (mad3-KEN20AAA) abolished the interaction between Mad3 and both Cdc20 and Mad2, demonstrating that it is necessary for MCC formation (Fig. 4, A and B).

https://openalex.org/W2133738718,"Transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor subtype I (TRPV1) is an ion channel gated by physical and chemical stimuli that belongs to the TRPV protein family. TRPV receptors contain a highly conserved, 6-mer segment near the channel gate, known as the TRP box, whose function remains unknown. Here, we performed an alanine scanning mutagenesis of the TRP box of TRPV1 (IWKLQR) and found that mutation of this motif affected channel gating by raising the free energy of channel activation. Functional characterization of TRPV1 mutants showed that substitution of I696, W697, and R701 by alanine severely affected voltage- and heat-dependent activation and notably reduced the capsaicin responsiveness and tachyphylaxia, while mutation of K698, L699, and Q700 had minor effects. In addition, mutation of I696 to alanine promoted a strong outward rectification at negative membrane potentials, and slowed the kinetics of channel activation. Taken together, our findings suggest that modification of I696, W697, and R701 to alanine altered channel function by affecting events downstream of the initial stimuli-sensing step and imply that intersubunit interactions within the TRP box play an important role in TRPV1 gating."

To determine the function of Scyl1, we have now used a mass spectrometry-based screen to search for Scyl1-binding partners and identified components of coatomer I (COPI) coats. The interaction was confirmed in pull-down assays, and Scyl1 co-immunoprecipitates with βCOP from brain lysates.

Scyl1 co-localizes with βCOP and is localized, in an Arf1-independent manner, to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and the cis-Golgi, sites of COPI-mediated membrane budding. The localization and binding properties of Scyl1 strongly suggest a function in COPI transport, and inhibitory RNA-mediated knock down of the protein disrupts COPI-mediated retrograde traffic of the KDEL receptor to the ER without affecting anterograde traffic from the ER. Our data demonstrate a function for Scyl1 as an accessory factor in COPI trafficking and suggest for the first time that alterations in the COPI pathway result in neurodegenerative disease.

The murine autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease model “muscle-deficient” (mdf) displays clinical and histological features indicative of a progressive motor neuropathy (1Blot S. Poirier C. Dreyfus P.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 54: 812-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Homozygotes develop a posterior waddle at 4-8 weeks of age followed by hind limb paralysis and forelimb weakness (1Blot S. Poirier C. Dreyfus P.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 54: 812-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscles exhibit a neurogenic atrophy, and there is progressive neurodegeneration of lower motor neurons (1Blot S.

Dis. 2007; 26: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Among the murine neuromuscular atrophies, the motor neuron degeneration in mdf is most similar to that seen in wobbler (1Blot S. Poirier C. Dreyfus P.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 54: 812-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mdf also suffers from symptoms indicative of cerebellar involvement including gait ataxia, abnormal hind limb posture, and tremor (3Schmidt W.M. Kraus C. Hoger H. Hochmeister S.

Therefore, mdf appears to be linked to both neuromuscular atrophy and spinocerebellar ataxia and is thus an animal model for neuromuscular disease with cerebellar involvement in humans. Most recently, null mutations in the Scy1-like 1 (Scyl1) gene were determined to be responsible for the pathology seen in the mdf mouse (3Schmidt W.M. Kraus C. Hoger H. Hochmeister S. Oberndorfer F.

Scy1-like kinases are thought to be kinase-inactive as they lack several highly conserved residues essential for catalytic activity (8Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T.

Scyl1 was indirectly implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis when it was identified as an in vitro binding partner for the α- and β2-ear domains of the clathrin adaptor protein-2 (AP-2) (in this study, Scyl1 was referred to as CVAK90) (10Schmid E.M. Ford M.G. Burtey A. Praefcke G.J. Peak-Chew S.Y. Mills I.G. Benmerah A. McMahon H.T. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: 262Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and when it was demonstrated to be one of 92 proteins that affect the endocytic entry of vesicular stomatitis virus in a small inhibitory RNA (siRNA)-based screen of the human “kinome” (11Pelkmans L. Fava E. Grabner H. Hannus M. Habermann B. Krausz E. Zerial M. Nature. 2005; 436: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). A variant of Scyl1, known as N-terminal kinase-like, was found to localize to centrosomes during mitosis and was thus argued to be involved in centrosome-related functions (12Kato M. Yano K.

Here we undertake a cell biological and biochemical characterization of Scyl1 in an attempt to better define the cellular pathway(s) in which the protein functions. Our data show that Scyl1 binds to and co-localizes with the membrane trafficking coatomer I (COPI) complex, and that this interaction is mediated predominantly through a novel dibasic motif, related to the classical KKXX-COO- motif that defines transmembrane protein interactions with COPI coats (13Nilsson T.

Our data firmly establish the localization of Scyl1 to the early secretory pathway, specifically at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the cis-Golgi, both of which are sites where COPI is known to function in Golgi to ER retrograde trafficking. Inhibitory RNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of Scyl1 leads to a defect in COPI-dependant trafficking of the KDEL receptor (KDELR) from the Golgi to the ER. Thus, Scyl1 functions in COPI-mediated vesicle trafficking, suggesting a link between this fundamental cellular pathway and neurodegenerative disorders. Antibodies and Reagents—An affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal most 28 amino acids of mouse Scyl1 (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) accession number: NP_076401) was a generous gift from Dr. Gustav Lienhard (Dartmouth Medical School) (4Liu S.C.

A monoclonal antibody against VSVG was graciously provided by Dr. Victor Hsu (Harvard Medical School). A polyclonal βCOP antibody for immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation was from AbCam. Antibody against NECAP 1 was described previously (16Ritter B. Denisov A.Y. Philie J. Deprez C. Tung E.C. Gehring K. McPherson P.S.

Peptides encoding the C terminus of Scyl1 (KKTTKGPMKLGARKLD-COO-) and p24α2 (QMRHLKSFFEAKKLV-COO-) were prepared with a free carboxyl group by New England Peptide. A peptide encoding two DPW motifs from epsin (CSDPWGSDPWG) was from the Yale Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory. Various cDNA constructs were prepared as described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. Pull-down and Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—For pull-down assays, frozen rat tissues were homogenized in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) and spun at 800 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was collected, and Triton X-100 was added to 1% final concentration. Following 15 min at 4 °C, the extracts were spun at 116,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was adjusted to 1 or 2 mg/ml, and NaCl was added to 50 mm final. Aliquots of 1 ml were incubated for ∼3 h at 4 °C with GST or GST-Scyl1 fusion proteins precoupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Beads were subsequently washed three times with ice-cold buffer A with 1% Triton X-100 and 50 mm NaCl and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Bands specifically interacting with GST-Scyl1 fusion proteins were cut and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS) as described (17Blondeau F. Ritter B. Allaire P.D. Wasiak S. Girard M.

For peptide competition experiments, GST fusion proteins of the C-terminal 15 amino acids of p24α2 (QMRHLKSFFEAKKLV) or full-length Scyl1 (see supplemental Experimental Procedures) were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose and were incubated with various peptides at defined molar ratios of peptide to fusion protein prior to the addition of the tissue extracts and processing of the samples as described above. For immunoprecipitation assays, tissue extracts prepared as described above were incubated with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies precoupled to protein A- or protein G-Sepharose, respectively, and the samples were processed as described for the pull-down assays. Immunofluorescence analysis is described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. Inhibitory RNA-mediated KD of Scyl1—Two siRNA sequences were used to deplete Scyl1 in HeLa cells: Scyl1-1, 5′-AAGAAGTGGTCAGCAGACATG-3′, and Scyl1-2,5′-AACCTCTTCCTGGAGGAGATT-3′. siRNAs were ordered from Qiagen Inc. and contained two-base deoxythymidine over-hangs. For transfection of siRNAs, HeLa cells were plated at 50% confluency in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) without antibiotics on 6-well dishes and transfected with either Scyl1-1, Scyl1-2, or a control siRNA: 5′-AACAGGATGAGTTTCTAAATT-3′, to a final concentration of 30 or 80 nm, using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. siRNAs were either transfected on two consecutive days at 30 nm or transfected once at 80 nm. Fresh Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with antibiotics was replaced following the final transfection, and 72 h after transfection, cells were replated onto glass coverslips. Following an overnight incubation at 37 °C, cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence. For Western blots, 2 wells of a 6-well plate were harvested 96 h after transfection in Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 detergent, 1% glycerol, 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) and spun at 23,500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected for analysis. Equal protein levels were loaded and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Alternatively, Scyl1 KD was achieved using a microRNA (miRNA) expression vector containing an oligonucleotide corresponding to Scyl1 siRNA 1. The sense oligonucleotide 5′-TGCTGCATGTCTGCTGACCACTTCTCGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACGAGAAGTGCAGCAGACATG-3′ or the sense control oligonucleotide 5′-TGCTGACGTGACACGTTCGGAGAATTGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACAATTCTCCACGTGTCACGT-3′ were annealed with their antisense partners and subcloned into the vector 6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR (Invitrogen) in which the open reading frame for EmGFP was replaced with mRFP. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 as described above. VSVG Anterograde Transport Assays—A VSVGts045-GFP chimera construct was transfected into cells following transfection with control or Scyl1-specific siRNA, and anterograde trafficking assays were performed essentially as described (18Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirschberg K. Zaal K.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 19Hirschberg K. Miller C.M. Ellenberg J. Presley J.F. Siggia E.D. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1485-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h after the first detectable expression of the GFP construct, cells were switched to the restrictive temperature of 40 °C, and after an overnight incubation, they were switched to media containing 150 μg/ml cycloheximide to prevent new VSVGts045-GFP protein synthesis. Cells were then transferred to the permissive temperature of 32 °C, and at various time points, they were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. VSVG-KDELR Retrograde Assays—VSVGts045-KDELR construct, a gift of Dr. Victor Hsu (Harvard Medical School), was transfected into cells 48 h following transfection of control or Scyl1-specific siRNA, and retrograde assays were performed essentially as described (20Cole N.B. Ellenberg J. Song J. DiEuliis D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 21Yang J.S. Lee S.Y. Spano S. Gad H. Zhang L. Nie Z. Bonazzi M. Corda D. Luini A. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4133-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, at 48 h following transfection of the VSVGts045-KDELR construct, cells were placed at the permissive temperature of 32 °C for 1 h. Following this incubation, half of the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. The remaining cells were placed at the nonpermissive temperature of 40 °C for 1 h, at which point they were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. Alternatively, retrograde trafficking assays were performed in HeLa cells with stable expression of a VSVGts045-KDELR construct containing a D195N mutation in the KDELR portion (20Cole N.B. Ellenberg J. Song J. DiEuliis D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The cells, a gift of Dr. Nelson Cole, National Institutes of Health, were transfected with control or Scyl1-specific miRNA plasmid. At 96 h after transfection, cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence or were placed at the non-permissive temperature of 40 °C for 1 h, at which point they were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. Scyl1 Interacts with COPI Coat Components—Scyl1 is composed of an N-terminal kinase-like domain and a C-terminal region containing three Huntingtin, elongation factor 3, PR65/A, TOR repeats and a coiled-coil domain (Fig. 1A). To better understand the function of Scyl1, we searched for protein-binding partners using pull-down assays from brain extracts with GST-full-length Scyl1 or the isolated C-terminal region (Fig. 1A). Specifically bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and tandem MS. As is common for relatively large GST fusion proteins, both GST-full-length and GST-C-terminal region fusion proteins had lower molecular weight bands corresponding to degradation products (supplemental Fig. 1). Despite this, a notable Scyl1-binding partner was detected at ∼130 kDa with both constructs (supplemental Fig. 1, arrows). Tandem MS of the bands led to 151 tandem MS profiles assigned to peptides with 92% of the peptides encoding αCOP. αCOP is one member of the heptameric COPI coat complex, which also includes β, β′, γ, δ, ϵ, and ζ subunits (22Wieland F. Harter C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 23Scales S.J. Gomez M. Kreis T.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 195: 67-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kirchhausen T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). An additional specific band was seen at ∼110 kDa with the C-terminal construct (supplemental Fig. 1, arrowhead). Tandem MS of this band revealed 98 assigned peptides nearly evenly distributed between four proteins, the α- and β2-adaptin subunits of the AP-2 complex, which is involved in CCV formation, as well as βCOP and β′COP. The identification of α- and β2-adaptin is consistent with the prior identification of Scyl1 in pull-downs using the ear domains of α- and β2-adaptin (10Schmid E.M. Ford M.G. Burtey A. Praefcke G.J. Peak-Chew S.Y. Mills I.G. Benmerah A. McMahon H.T. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: 262Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The identification of α, β, and β′COP subunits reveals that Scyl1 binds to components of COPI coats. Confirmation was obtained by βCOP blots of Scyl1 pull-downs, which demonstrated that the interaction occurs with both the full-length protein and the isolated C-terminal region (Fig. 1B). Immunoprecipitation of βCOP from brain extracts led to a specific co-immunoprecipitation of Scyl1 (Fig. 1C), and endogenous βCOP in HEK-293 cells co-immunoprecipitated with GFP-full-length Scyl1 transfected into the cells (data not shown). In contrast, we did not detect co-immunoprecipitation of Scyl1 and the AP-2 complex (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). Together, these data reveal Scyl1 as a specific COPI-binding partner. Scyl1 Binds COPI Coats through a RKXX-COO- Motif—We next sought to determine the binding site on Scyl1 for COPI coats. For type 1 integral membrane ER-resident proteins, a KKXX motif, where K is present at the −3 and −4 positions, is an efficient ER retrieval signal (15Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Fullekrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A. Paccaud J.P. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nilsson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). KKXX-COO- motifs bind the COPI coat complex to target ER proteins that have escaped from the ER into COPI vesicles for retrograde transport (13Nilsson T. Jackson M. Peterson P.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 14Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Similar COPI-binding motifs are found in the p24 family of proteins, which constitutively cycle between the ER and the Golgi (15Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Fullekrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A. Paccaud J.P.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11649-11654Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or the WD40 domains at the N terminus of αCOP and β′COP (26Eugster A. Frigerio G. Dale M. Duden R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3905-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 27Eugster A. Frigerio D. Dale M. Duden R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1011-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, a recent study indicates that whereas KKXX-COO- motifs from ER residents bind α and β′COP, p24 proteins may bind exclusively to γCOP and that this depends on other determinants (28Béthune J. Kol M. Hoffmann J. Reckmann I. Brügger B. Wieland F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8011-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, following the coiled-coil domain, Scyl1 contains a 10-amino-acid stretch that ends with the sequence RKLD-COO- (Fig. 2A). Deletion of the last 10 amino acids of Scyl1 greatly reduces but does not eliminate its binding to COPI coats, as indicated with an antibody against βCOP (Fig. 2B). Mutation of RK to AA (Fig. 2A) leads to a similar decrease in binding (Fig. 2B). The residual binding seen with these constructs is eliminated upon subsequent deletion of the coiled-coil domain of Scyl1 (Fig. 2, A and C). Thus, Scyl1 primarily uses a sequence similar to the canonical motifs found in ER-resident and p24 proteins for binding to COPI coat proteins with a probable second COPI-binding site in the coiled-coil domain. To compare the COPI binding properties of the RKLD-COO- sequence with a KKXX-COO- motif, we prepared a GST fusion protein encoding the last 15 amino acids of p24α2 ending with KKLV-COO-, which was previously shown to bind COPI coats (15Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Fullekrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A. Paccaud J.P. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nilsson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). GST-p24α2 binds COPI, as indicated by βCOP Western blot, but there is less binding than to GST-Scyl1, although there is less Scyl1 fusion protein in the assay (supplemental Fig. 3A). To examine this further, we performed binding assays over a range of fusion protein concentrations from 425 to 6800 nm for GST-p24α2 and 12.5-200 nm for GST-Scyl1. βCOP binding to Scyl1 saturates at ∼100 nm fusion protein with half-maximal binding at ∼50 nm (supplemental Fig. 3B). In contrast, binding to p24α2 does not saturate under these conditions, and the half-maximal binding is greater than 3.4 μm (supplemental Fig. 3B). Thus, Scyl1 appears to have higher affinity than p24α2 for COPI coats. To examine whether the two motifs bind to the same or different sites on COPI coats, we performed peptide competition experiments in which GST-Scyl1 was incubated with brain extracts in the presence of increasing amounts of a peptide encoding the 16 C-terminal most residues of Scyl1 including RKLD-COO-, the 15 C-terminal most residues of p24α2 including KKLV-COO-, or an epsin peptide encoding DPW motifs and previously shown to compete binding of DPW proteins to the α-ear of AP-2 (29Allaire P.D. Ritter B. Thomas S. Burman J.L. Denisov A.Y. Legendre-Guillemin V. Harper S.Q. Davidson B.L. Gehring K. McPherson P.S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13202-13212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Binding of COPI coats was monitored by βCOP Western blot. Although the Scyl1 peptide competed binding of GST-Scyl1 to COPI coats, neither the epsin peptide nor the p24α2 peptide had any effect (Fig. 2D). However, both the p24α2 and the Scyl1 peptides competed binding of COPI coats to GST-p24α2, whereas the epsin peptide had no influence (supplemental Fig. 3C). One possible explanation for these data is that the RKLD-COO- of Scyl1 binds to a distinct site on COPI coats when compared with the KKLV-COO- sequence of p24α2. However, since Scyl1 binding is of higher affinity, and the peptide sequences are related, the Scyl1 peptide is able to compete binding of p24α2 to its unique site in COPI coats. It is also possible that Scyl1 has two binding sites on COPI coats, one of higher affinity that is unique from that of p24α2 and a second that is identical to that of canonical KKXX-COO- motifs. Further studies will be required to distinguish between these two related hypotheses and to determine the precise binding subunit and site on COPI coats. Scyl1 Co-localizes with βCOP—We next examined the localization of Scyl1 by immunocytochemistry. Confocal immunofluorescence analysis in COS-7 and HeLa cells revealed endogenous Scyl1 staining in peripheral punctae and punctae that were concentrated in a juxtanuclear area. A representative example in HeLa cells is shown in Fig. 3A. Both the peripheral and the juxtanuclear pools of Scyl1 co-localize with βCOP (Fig. 3A). Three independent pieces of data strongly support that the staining is specific and due to endogenous Scyl1. First, GFP-tagged full-length Scyl1 co-localizes with βCOP at both peripheral punctae (Fig. 3B) and in the juxtanuclear area (see Fig. 6). Similar results are seen for a GFP-C-terminal Scyl1 construct (Fig. 3B and data not shown). Second, as determined by Western blot, two siRNA sequences targeted against Scyl1 lead to a dramatic and specific reduction in Scyl1 expression in HeLa cells when compared with a control siRNA (Fig. 4A), and both siRNAs lead to a drastic reduction in immunofluorescence signal with the Scyl1 antibody (Fig. 4B). The loss of both the juxtanuclear and the peripheral punctate pools of endogenous Scyl1 is highlighted in cultures in which cells treated with control siRNA or Scyl1-specific siRNA were mixed prior to immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 4C). Lastly, the antibody used to detect endogenous Scyl1 in this study is the same as that used by Schmidt et al. (3Schmidt W.M. Kraus C. Hoger H. Hochmeister S. Oberndorfer F. Branka M. Bingemann S.

EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) in which mdf mice suffering from loss of Scyl1 expression show little immunocytochemical signal. Although Scyl1 also binds to α- and β2-adaptin in pull-down assays (10Schmid E.M. Ford M.G. Burtey A. Praefcke G.J. Peak-Chew S.Y. Mills I.G. Benmerah A. McMahon H.T.

McPherson, unpublished data. it does not co-localize with AP-2 (supplemental Fig. 2B). Thus, the Scyl1 staining detected here is specific and reveals that the protein is localized to COPI-coated membranes, consistent with its binding to COPI coat proteins.FIGURE 6Scyl1 co-localizes with βCOP at the cis-Golgi.

https://openalex.org/W1967530615,"A coordinated reciprocal interaction between epithelium and mesenchyme is involved in salivary gland morphogenesis. The submandibular glands (SMGs) of Wnt1-Cre/R26R mice have been shown positive for mesenchyme, whereas the epithelium is β-galactosidase-negative, indicating that most mesenchymal cells are derived from cranial neural crest cells. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor α is one of the markers of neural crest-derived cells. In this study, we analyzed the roles of PDGFs and their receptors in the morphogenesis of mouse SMGs. PDGF-A was shown to be expressed in SMG epithelium, whereas PDGF-B, PDGFRα, and PDGFRβ were expressed in mesenchyme. Exogenous PDGF-AA and -BB in SMG organ cultures demonstrated increased levels of branching and epithelial proliferation, although their receptors were found to be expressed in mesenchyme. In contrast, short interfering RNA for Pdgfa and -b as well as neutralizing antibodies for PDGF-AB and -BB showed decreased branching. PDGF-AA induced the expression of the fibroblast growth factor genes Fgf3 and -7, and PDGF-BB induced the expression of Fgf1, -3, -7, and -10, whereas short interfering RNA for Pdgfa and Pdgfb inhibited the expression of Fgf3, -7, and -10, indicating that PDGFs regulate Fgf gene expression in SMG mesenchyme. The PDGF receptor inhibitor AG-17 inhibited PDGF-induced branching, whereas exogenous FGF7 and -10 fully recovered. Together, these results indicate that fibroblast growth factors function downstream of PDGF signaling, which regulates Fgf expression in neural crest-derived mesenchymal cells and SMG branching morphogenesis. Thus, PDGF signaling is a possible mechanism involved in the interaction between epithelial and neural crest-derived mesenchyme.

Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). This growth factor family is known to have four members at present, PDGF-A, -B, -C, and -D, all of which assemble into homo- or heterodimer forms. PDGFs bind to two tyrosine kinase receptors, PDGFRα and -β, with PDGF-A, -B, and -C binding to PDGFRα as high affinity ligands and PDGF-B and -D binding to PDGFRβ (2Betsholtz C. Karlsson L.

PDGFRα is expressed in the embryo by several different types of progenitor cells that proliferate and migrate in response to PDGF (3Lindahl P. Betsholtz C. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1998; 7: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For example, PDGFRα is expressed in precursor cells that become cranial neural crest (NC) cells and is thought to be required for migration of those cells into the branchial arches. PDGFRα is also expressed by smooth muscle progenitors in developing lungs (4Lindahl P. Karlsson L. Hellstrom M. Gebre-Medhin S. Willetts K. Heath J.K. Betsholtz C. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 3943-3953PubMed Google Scholar) and widely throughout the embryonic mesenchyme (5Orr-Urtreger A. Lonai P. Development (Camb.). 1992; 115: 1045-1058PubMed Google Scholar). PDGFRα-deficient mice have a variety of defects in crest-derived tissues, including gross craniofacial, skeletal, and cardiac abnormalities (6Orr-Urtreger A. Bedford M.T. Do M.S. Eisenbach L. Lonai P. Development (Camb.). 1992; 115: 289-303PubMed Google Scholar, 7Morrison-Graham K. Schatteman G.C. Bork T. Bowen-Pope D.F. Weston J.A.

These mice are deficient in functional cardiac NC cells, although it is unclear whether the deficiency is in the number of cells that reach target tissues, in NC cell differentiation, or functional target sites, such as cardiac and nasal septation defects and cleft face, cleft palate, and tooth defects (5Orr-Urtreger A. Lonai P. Development (Camb.). 1992; 115: 1045-1058PubMed Google Scholar, 10Soriano P. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 2691-2700PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ding H. Wu X. Kim I. Tam P.P. Koh G.Y. Nagy A.

Bringas Jr., P. Soriano P. Chai Y. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 232: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). PDGFRα signaling has also been implicated in the migration and survival of cranial NC cells. In explant experiments, PDGF-A enhanced NC cell motility without affecting proliferation, and stimulated cultured NC cells to secrete matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and its activator membrane-type MMP (14Robbins J.R. McGuire P.G. Wehrle-Haller B. Rogers S.L. Dev. Biol. 1999; 212: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Li J. Hoyle G.W. Dev. Biol. 2001; 239: 338-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, conditional mutant NCC-PDGFRα embryos do not exhibit defects in NC survival, migration, or proliferation, suggesting that PDGFRα is required for post-migratory NC functions (12Tallquist M.D. Soriano P. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Although PDGF-B and PDGFRβ knock-out mice die around the time of birth, the roles of PDGF-B in adult vascular, kidney, and retina pathogeneses have been elucidated in studies that used conditional knock-out mice, transgenic mice, and mice harboring mutations that alter PDGF activity without causing early lethality (16Boucher P. Gotthardt M. Li W.P. Anderson R.G. Herz J. Science. 2003; 300: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 17Klinghoffer R.A. Mueting-Nelsen P.F. Faerman A. Shani M. Soriano P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Kidneys and retinas are both particularly sensitive to mutations in the PDGFRβ signaling domain, as those affected exhibit the hallmarks of glomerulosclerosis and proliferative retinopathy (17Klinghoffer R.A. Mueting-Nelsen P.F. Faerman A. Shani M. Soriano P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate that PDGF-A and -B are critical for regulating organogenesis. The process of branching morphogenesis is utilized in all animals to form complex-ordered structures and involves dynamic and reciprocal interactions between different tissue types, often through the use of conserved molecular programs (18Hogan B.L. Cell. 1999; 96: 225-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 19Metzger R.J. Krasnow M.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1635-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In vivo, submandibular gland (SMG) development is initiated as a thickening of oral epithelium on about embryonic day 12 (E12), when an initial epithelium bud on a stalk grows into condensing neural crest-derived mesenchyme. Clefts in the epithelium result in 3–5 epithelial buds by E13.5, then branching morphogenesis occurs with continued proliferation, along with successive rounds of cleft formation, duct elongation, and lumen formation, resulting in a highly branched gland by E14 (20Patel V.N. Rebustini I.T. Hoffman M.P. Differentiation. 2006; 74: 349-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Branching morphogenesis by mouse SMGs is regulated by multiple growth factors, which has been shown in ex vivo experiments to involve both fibroblast growth factor receptor (21Hoffman M.P.

Furthermore, FGF10-null mice have no salivary glands, lungs, or pituitary glands as well as minor defects in the formation of teeth, kidneys, and hair follicles (31Min H. Danilenko D.M. Scully S.A.

When exogenous FGF7 or -10 was added to epithelial rudiments of mouse salivary glands, FGF7-induced epithelial budding and FGF10-induced duct elongation were observed, whereas FGF10 also induced cell proliferation at the tips of the ducts of salivary glands and FGF7 induced widespread proliferation (25Steinberg Z.

In addition, mesenchymal FGFs regulate epithelial proliferation and branching morphogenesis of SMGs. Nevertheless, the activities of PDGFs in salivary gland morphogenesis have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we studied the roles of PDGF-A and PDGF-B in SMG branching morphogenesis. Both induced FGF expression in mesenchymal cells and also enhanced epithelial proliferation and branching morphogenesis in SMG organ cultures. Preparation of Tissue Sections and Immunostaining—We used Wnt1-Cre/R26R double transgenic mice, which have been reported previously (34Chai Y. Jiang X. Ito Y. Bringas Jr., P. Han J. Rowitch D.H. Soriano P. McMahon A.P. Sucov H.M. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole embryos (E14.5) were stained for β-galactosidase activity using standard procedures and then fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fixed embryos were washed three times in 0.005% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate in PBS. Next they were stained overnight at room temperature using a mixture of 0.4% X-gal, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, and 2 mm MgCl2 in PBS, then rinsed twice in PBS, and post-fixed in 4% formaldehyde. The embryos were dehydrated using alcohol and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut at a thickness of 10 μm and counter-stained with Nuclear Fast Red. E14 ICR mouse heads were dissected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The tissues were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co.) for frozen sectioning and then cut into 8-μm sections with a cryostat (2800 FRIGOCUT; Leica). Immunohistochemistry examinations were performed with the sections, which were incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 h before incubation with the primary antibody. We used antibodies directed against PDGF-A (SC-128, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PDGF-B (AB1550, Abcam), PDGFRα (AB15501, Abcam), PDGFRβ (1469-1, Epitomics), perlcan (MAB1948, CHEMICON), and lamininβ1 (AB3003, Abcam). Primary antibodies were detected by Alexa488- or Alexa594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). A fluorescent microscope (Biozero-8000; Keyence, Japan) was used for immunofluorescent image analysis. Semiquantitative and Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in 20 μl of 1× first-strand buffer containing 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) as a primer, 500 μm dNTP, and 200 units of SuperScript III (Invitrogen). PCR was performed in 25 μl of 1× first PCR buffer containing 2 μl of reverse transcription products, 1 unit of Ex TaqDNA polymerase (Takara, Japan), 200 μm dNTP, and 0.4 μm of the primer pair. PCR amplification was performed using primers listed in the supplemental Table. The PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels. Real time PCR amplification was performed using primers with SYBR Green PCR master mix with detection by a TaqMan 7700 Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). PCR was performed for 40 cycles, at 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, as reported previously (35Fukumoto E. Sakai H. Fukumoto S. Yagi T. Takagi O. Kato Y. J. Dent. Res. 2003; 82: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—SMG organ cultures were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 1% penicillin and streptomycin and then treated with PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB for 0–60 min at 37 °C. Next, the tissues were washed twice with 1 mm of ice-cold sodium orthovanadate (Sigma), lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors at 4 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged, after which the supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube. After boiling for 10 min, the proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Blots were probed using rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody or rabbit polyclonal anti-p44/42 MAPK antibody (Cell Signaling), with secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling). The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was detected with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to x-ray film. Ex Vivo Submandibular Organ Culture—Submandibular and sublingual salivary gland rudiments (referred to as SMGs in this study) were dissected from E13 ICR mice and cultured on Whatman Nucleopore track-etch filters (13 mm, 0.1-μm pore size; VWR, Buffalo Grove, IL) at the air/medium interface. The filters were floated on 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 in 50-mm glass-bottom microwell dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA). The medium was supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 150 μg/ml vitamin C, and 50 μg/ml transferrin. Five SMGs were cultured on each filter at 37 °C in an atmosphere of humidified 5% CO2, 95% air. In case of addition of exogenous PDGFs, either 10 ng/ml of PDGF-AA (Upstate) or 1 ng/ml of PDGF-BB (Systems) was added to the culture medium. The SMGs were photographed after 2, 24, and 48 h, and the end buds were counted at each time point. Each experiment was repeated at least five times. Aliquots of the PCD reactions were analyzed by gel electrophoresis to confirm that a single product of the expected size was amplified. The reactions were run in triplicate and repeated at least three times, with results combined to generate graphs. BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—After treatment with PDGF-AA or -BB, BrdUrd was added to the plates (10 mm) for 30 min, then the organs were fixed with cold methanol for 10 min, rehydrated in PBS, and incubated for 30 min in 1.5 m HCl. After washing three times in PBS, the organs were incubated with a 1:50 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the organs were washed in PBS three times and the nuclei stained with propidium iodide (Vector Laboratories). BrdUrd-positive cells were examined under a microscope (Biozero-8000; Keyence, Japan) as described previously (36Yoshizaki K. Yamamoto S. Yamada A. Yuasa K. Iwamoto T. Fukumoto E. Harada H. Saito M.

SMGs were transfected with 200 nm siRNA duplex in regular serum-free culture medium using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol (39Nishiguchi M. Yuasa K. Saito K. Fukumoto E. Yamada A. Hasegawa T. Yoshizaki K. Kamasaki Y. Nonaka K. Fujiwara T. Fukumoto S. Arch. Oral Biol. 2007; 52: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). An equal concentration of negative control siRNA duplex (Stealth RNAi negative control kit, Invitrogen) or scramble siRNA for PDGF-A and PDGF-B was used for the control SMGs. Addition of PDGF Antibodies, Recombinant FGFRs, and Kinase Inhibitor—E13 SMGs were cultured for 48 h as described above with neutralizing antibodies to PDGFs or recombinant FGFRs. Neutralizing antibodies to PDGF-AB (06-127, Upstate) and PDGF-BB (AB10845, Abcam) were used for neutralization of PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB, and PDGF-BB activities, as well as a goat IgG control (SC2028-L, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and added to culture media at concentrations of 0.2–10 μg/ml. Next, 10 μg/ml of rFGFR1b (655-FR, R & D Systems) or 2 μg/ml of rFGFR2b (708-MF, R & D Systems) was added. Furthermore, 375 nm of AG-17 (Calbiochem) and 0.75 μm of SU5402 (Calbiochem) were added to the culture medium at the beginning of each experiment. FGF1 (500 ng/ml), FGF2 (200 ng/ml), FGF3 (1 μg/ml), FGF7 (500 ng/ml), and FGF10 (1 μg/ml) were added to the culture medium after AG-17 treatment. All FGFs were purchased from R & D Systems. Control SMGs were cultured with an equal volume of the vehicle DMSO (Sigma). All SMGs were cultured for 48 h, and branching morphogenesis was quantified as described above. Statistical Analysis—All values shown represent the mean ± S.D. To compare mean values between groups, ANOVA with LSD post hoc tests were used. All p values shown are two-tailed, and those with <0.05 were considered to be significant. Salivary Gland Mesenchymal Cells Are Derived from Cranial Neural Crest—To determine the role of PDGFs in SMG branching morphogenesis, we attempted to determine the fate of PDGFRα-positive NC cells in normal salivary glands using the Wnt1-Cre/R26R mice, which is a Wnt1-Cre transgenic mediated DNA recombination mouse strain that results from being crossed with the ROSA26 conditional reporter (R26) transgene. R26R exhibits constitutive β-galactosidase expression in all cells when activated by ubiquitously expressed Cre, and it is ideal for monitoring Cre-mediated expression and performing cell lineage analysis. By utilizing the Wnt1 promoter, Cre expression was restricted to the precursors of NC cells. On E14.5, β-galactosidase-positive cells were restricted to mesenchymal cells in the SMG but not in the epithelium (Fig. 1A). This result indicates that embryonic SMG mesenchyme is derived from cranial NC cells. Expression of PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGFαR, and PDGFβR in Developing SMGs—Next, we examined the expressions of PDGF-A and -B, and PDGFRα and -β in E14 SMGs using immunohistochemistry. To clarify the border between epithelium and mesenchyme, we performed immunostaining with antibodies for perlecan and laminin β1, which are components of the basement membrane. PDGF-A was mainly expressed in epithelia in the ducts and terminal buds of SMGs, although it was weakly detected in mesenchyme (Fig. 1, B and C). Furthermore, PDGF-B and PDGFRα were mainly expressed in mesenchymal cells in the SMGs and weakly in epithelium, whereas PDGFRβ was only detected in mesenchymal cells in the SMGs and not in the epithelium (Fig. 1, B and C). On E13, SMGs are known to have three epithelial buds and begin to undergo branching morphogenesis. During this stage, PDGF-A and -B and PDGFRα and -β can be found expressed in dissected SMGs, whereas mRNA for Pdgfa and Pdgfrα is expressed during all developmental stages. In this study, Pdgfb and Pdgfrβ expression was shown to be the highest on E15 (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). To confirm the expression pattern of PDGFs and their receptors observed in our immunohistochemical analysis, epithelia and mesenchymal tissue samples from E13 SMG were separated by treatment with Dispase, and mRNA of Pdgfs and their receptors was analyzed by RT-PCR (Fig. 1D). Pdgfa mRNA was mainly expressed in epithelium and weakly in mesenchyme, whereas that of Pdgfb, Pdgfrα, and -β was only detected in mesenchyme and not in epithelium, which was similar to our immunohistochemistry findings (Fig. 1, E and F). PDGF-AA and -BB Activate ERK1/2 Phosphorylation and Enhance Branching Morphogenesis in SMG Cultures—PDGF induces phosphorylation of PDGFR and activates the Ras-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway; therefore, we analyzed the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in SMG organ cultures. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was observed at 5 min after stimulation with PDGF-AA and then disappeared after 30 min, whereas that of ERK1/2 was observed at 5 and 60 min after stimulation with PDGF-BB (Fig. 2A). Next, we separated epithelium and mesenchyme tissues from the SMG organ cultures, and stimulated them with either PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was observed in SMG mesenchymal cells but not in the epithelium (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that functional PDGFRα and -β are expressed in SMG mesenchyme and transmit PDGF signaling into mesenchymal cells. Next, we examined the functional importance of PDGFs using organ culture assays. Under the normal condition, SMGs from E13 mice showed an increase in number of terminal buds (Fig. 2C), with the number about 15-fold greater after 48 h as compared with 2 h. However, the addition of PDGF-AA caused an increase in branching morphogenesis in E13 SMGs, which was shown by an increase in the number of terminal buds by ∼20% after 24 and 48 h as compared with the control (Fig. 2, D and E). Similar results were observed after stimulation with PDGF-BB (Fig. 2, D and E). siRNA and Anti-PDGF Antibodies Inhibit Branching Morphogenesis—Decreases in PDGF-AA and -BB gene expression following siRNA treatment were determined by RT-PCR after 20 h. RT-PCR analysis with PDGF-A and -B primers indicated a reduction of ∼80% in the messenger level of PDGF-A and about a 90% reduction in that of PDGF-B, as compared with the control SMG cultures (Fig. 3). The addition of PDGF-A and -B siRNA dramatically inhibited branching morphogenesis at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 4A), with the numbers of terminal buds reduced by about 55 and 65%, respectively, as compared after 2 h (Fig. 4, A and B). Negative control and scramble siRNA did not have any effect on the branching morphogenesis of the SMGs (data not shown).FIGURE 4siRNA and the neutralizing antibody for PDGF inhibited SMG branching morphogenesis.

Addition of the anti-PDGF-AB antibody to the SMG cultures dramatically inhibited branching morphogenesis at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 4, C and D). Similar results were observed with the addition of the anti-PDGF-BB antibody, although the effects were less pronounced as compared with anti-PDGF-AB (Fig. 4, C and D). Rabbit control IgG did not have an effect on the branching morphogenesis of SMGs (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that endogenous PDGF-A and PDGF-B are necessary for the development of SMGs. PDGF-AA and -BB Enhance and siRNA for PDGF-A and -B Inhibit SMG Epithelial Proliferation—To clarify the mechanism of branching morphogenesis stimulated by PDGF-AA and -BB, SMG proliferation was determined by measuring BrdUrd incorporation (supplemental Fig. 2A). BrdUrd incorporation by SMG epithelium following the addition of PDGF-AA and -BB was increased by about 1.8- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared with the control cultures (Fig. 5A), with BrdUrd incorporation found to be increased in both the terminal buds and duct regions of epithelia (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. 2A). In contrast, BrdUrd-positive cells were not detected in the mesenchyme with any of the tested conditions (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. 2A). These results suggest that PDGF-AA and -BB accelerate the proliferation of SMG epithelium and branching morphogenesis, whereas they do not have an effect on mesenchymal proliferation. To analyze the effects of PDGF-A and -B siRNA during branching morphogenesis, we performed BrdUrd incorporation assays with SMG organ cultures. In the control culture, ∼35% of the epithelial cells were BrdUrd-positive, whereas ∼3% of mesenchymal cells were positive. In s"

We compared the effects of ectopic Runx expression in established fibroblasts, where all three genes produce an indistinguishable phenotype entailing epithelioid morphology and increased cell survival under stress conditions. Gene array analysis revealed a strongly overlapping transcriptional signature, with no examples of opposing regulation of the same target gene. A common set of 50 highly regulated genes was identified after further filtering on regulation by inducible RUNX1-ER. This set revealed a strong bias toward genes with annotated roles in cancer and development, and a preponderance of targets encoding extracellular or surface proteins, reflecting the marked effects of Runx on cell adhesion. Furthermore, in silico prediction of resistance to glucocorticoid growth inhibition was confirmed in fibroblasts and lymphoid cells expressing ectopic Runx. The effects of fibroblast expression of common RUNX1 fusion oncoproteins (RUNX1-ETO, TEL-RUNX1 and CBFB-MYH11) were also tested. Although two direct Runx activation target genes were repressed (Ncam1 and Rgc32), the fusion proteins appeared to disrupt the regulation of downregulated targets (Cebpd, Id2 and Rgs2) rather than impose constitutive repression. These results elucidate the oncogenic potential of the Runx family and reveal novel targets for therapeutic inhibition."

Rabs require activation by specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that stimulate the exchange of GDP for GTP.

Rab proteins belong to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases and regulate discrete steps in vesicular transport pathways (1Grosshans B.L. Ortiz D. Novick P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11821-11827Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). More than 60 Rab family members are known in mammalian cells. Different Rabs are localized to specific cellular compartments where they are primary determinants of membrane identity and exert multiple local activities (2Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Traffic. 2004; 5: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Rab proteins are posttranslationally modified by geranylgeranylation, which is required for membrane association and proper function (5Leung K.F. Baron R. Seabra M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 467-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). After prenylation, Rabs form a complex with Rab escort protein, which is dissociated upon membrane association of the newly prenylated Rabs.Regulation of Rab function is determined by the ability to cycle between a GDP-bound inactive form and a GTP-bound active form (6Vetter I.R.

Activated Rab-GTP binds effector proteins, which perform critical functions in the organization of membrane traffic. GTPase-activating proteins return Rabs to their inactive state by accelerating intrinsic Rab GTP hydrolysis. Once back in the GDP-bound form, Rabs are extracted from membranes by Rab guanine dissociation inhibitor (7Goody R.S. Rak A. Alexandrov K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1657-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).The regulation of Rab activation plays a crucial role in determining when and where a given Rab exerts its cellular activity. In contrast to the large number of GEFs known for the Ras, Rho, and Arf families, few Rab GEFs have been identified to date (8Bos J.L. Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A.

For a 16-mm well, 0.625 μl of Oligofectamine and a final concentration of 50 nm siRNA oligonucleotide was used. HEK-293 cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides as described for melanocytes, followed by transfection with plasmid DNA and FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Adenovirus Production and Infection of Melanocytes—Expression cassettes containing cDNA sequences assembled in pENTR were incorporated into the adenovirus packaging vector pAd/BLOCK-iT-DEST (Invitrogen) through recombination between pENTR attL sites and pAd/BLOCK-iT-DEST attR sites by using LR clonase II (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's protocol. pAd plasmids were linearized with PacI restriction enzyme and transfected into HEK-293 producer cells using FuGENE6. Viral particles were harvested after lysis of infected cells 11 days later and were subjected to one round of amplification in HEK-293 cells. Cell lysates were prepared by three rounds of freeze-thawing, cleared by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 15 min, and used to transduce melanocytes seeded the day before infection.Microscopy—Cells grown on coverslips were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, and rinsed with PBS. For immunofluorescence, fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.05% saponin in PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 15 min.

His6-Rab3GEP and His6-GRAB were prepared from S. frugiperda cell pellets. Recombinant proteins were purified on a nickel-Sepharose column by fast protein liquid chromatography as described previously (22Leung K.F. Baron R. Ali B.R. Magee A.I. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1487-1497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-Rab27a, GST, and GST-Slp11–200 (amino acids 1–200) were expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads.Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were washed with PBS and disrupted by sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Homogenates were cleared by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and used for immunoblot analysis. Alternatively, samples were subjected to ultra-centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Equivalent volumes of the cytosolic soluble fraction and the resuspended pellet were analyzed by immunoblotting.Immunoblotting—Protein samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T), incubated with primary antibody in PBS-T, washed three times with PBS-T, incubated with horse-radish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Dako, 1:10,000), and washed as above. Bound antibody was detected using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences).GST Pulldown Assay—Melanocytes treated with siRNAs were lysed 72 h after transfection in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. 20 μg of total protein was incubated with 2 μm GST or GST-Slp1 and 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 45 min at room temperature in a reaction volume of 100 μl. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Rab27a monoclonal antibody. The results were quantified by densitometry using Fuji Film Intelligent Dark Box LAS-3000 and Aida Image Analyze 3.52 software. To visualize GST and GST-Slp1, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated for 1 min in Amido Black staining solution (Sigma).GDP/GTP Exchange Assay—Rab3GEP activity was assayed by measuring the association of [35S]GTPγS with His-tagged Rab1a, Rab3a, Rab5a, Rab8a, Rab27a, and Rab27b. For time course exchange assays, 480 pmol of His-Rab was incubated at 30 °C with 0 or 60 pmol of recombinant Rab3GEP in a 300-μl reaction volume containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.6 pmol of [35S]GTPγS (Amersham Biosciences), and 959.4 pmol of GTPγS (Fluka) (1562.5 dpm/pmol). At each time point, a 50-μl aliquot was removed, and the reaction was stopped by snap freezing in liquid nitrogen. Protein samples were applied to nitrocellulose filters (Whatman) pre-equilibrated in ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Filters were washed twice with 2 ml of ice-cold wash buffer. Protein-bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting.RESULTSDown-regulation of Rab3GEP in Melanocytes Results in Melanosome Aggregation—To identify the GEF for Rab27 in mammalian cells, we took a candidate gene approach. We hypothesized that GEFs for the closely related Rab3 proteins could function as Rab27 GEFs. We examined two previously identified Rab3 GEFs, Rab3GEP (14Wada M. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Hirano H. Obaishi H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3875-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and GRAB (15Luo H.R. Saiardi A. Nagata E. Ye K. Yu H. Jung T.S. Luo X. Jain S. Sawa A. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 2001; 31: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the function of these GEF proteins in melanocytes and investigate their putative roles as Rab27a GEFs, we used siRNA. Immunoblotting revealed that endogenous Rab3GEP was efficiently depleted by mouse Rab3GEP-specific siRNAs but not by non-targeting siRNAs in mouse melanocytes (Fig. 1I). Depletion of Rab3GEP with four different siRNA oligonucleotides resulted in clustering of melanosomes in the perinuclear area as opposed to the even distribution observed in control cells transfected with non-targeting siRNAs (Fig. 1, A–D and F). All four duplexes were similarly efficient at inducing aggregation of melanosomes (Rab3GEP-1, 81%; Rab3GEP-2, 83%; Rab3GEP-3, 87%; and Rab3GEP-4, 82% of cells 72 h after transfection) (Fig. 1H). The number and morphology of melanosomes were similar to control cells. The melanosome aggregation phenotype resembles that observed in mouse melanocytes lacking functional Rab27a (ashen) (Fig. 1G), Mlph (leaden), or myosin Va (dilute) (4Seabra M.C. Coudrier E. Traffic. 2004; 5: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and in cells treated with Mlph-specific siRNA (Fig. 1E).Melanosome clustering was induced by depleting cells of Rab3GEP using Rab3GEP-1 siRNA, and Rab3GEP activity was subsequently reintroduced using adenoviruses expressing tagged human Rab3GEP or GFP as a control (Fig. 2). Human Rab3GEP contains five nucleotides that differ from the corresponding mouse sequence in the target region for Rab3GEP-1 and is thus resistant to siRNA-mediated knockdown. In cells transduced with virus carrying GFP alone, melanosome distribution was not altered (Fig. 2, C and D), with melanosome clustering seen in 65% of Rab3GEP siRNA-treated cells. However, expression of exogenous GFP-tagged or V5-tagged human Rab3GEP rescued the observed phenotype (Fig. 2, E–H), dramatically reducing the number of cells with clustered melanosomes to 8 or 9%, respectively. As expected, expression of human Rab3GEP did not reverse the clustering of melanosomes induced by depletion of Mlph (Fig. 2, I and J).FIGURE 2Expression of exogenous Rab3GEP restores normal melanosome distribution in Rab3GEP-depleted cells. A–J, melanocytes were treated with siRNAs specific for Rab3GEP (Rab3GEP-1) (A–H) or Mlph (I and J). After 48 h, cells were infected with adenovirus expressing GFP (C and D), GFP-humanRab3GEP (E and F), or V5-humanRab3GEP (G–J). 24 h later, cells were fixed and where indicated were permeabilized and labeled for V5. Phase-contrast images are shown in B, D, F, H, and J; GFP fluorescence (green) in C and E; and V5 labeling (red) in G and I. K, melanosome distribution in Rab3GEP-1-transfected cells transduced with virus expressing GFP, GFP-humanRab3GEP, or V5-humanRab3GEP was scored as either clustered (black) or dispersed (gray) and plotted as a percentage of the total number of cells counted (n > 150 cells in each case).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This suggests that Rab3GEP plays a role in melanosome transport and functions in the same pathway as Rab27a/Mlph/myosin Va. A putative role for Rab3GEP as a GEF for Rab27a in melanocytes would be consistent with these results. Furthermore, our data suggest that Rab3GEP activity is not redundant in melanocytes.Similar experiments using GRAB-specific siRNAs did not show any effect on melanosome distribution (Fig. 3, A–C). To exclude the possibility that the function of Rab3GEP in melanocytes could be mediated via one of the isoforms of Rab3, we also depleted cells of Rab3. Rab3a, b, c, and d were targeted with specific siRNAs, either separately (data not shown) or simultaneously (Fig. 3, D and E). Immunoblotting with an antibody reactive with all four isoforms demonstrated loss of Rab3 in the transfected melanocytes, but no effect on melanosome transport was observed.FIGURE 3Loss of GRAB or Rab3 does not affect melanosome distribution. A, melan-ink4a cells were transfected with GRAB-specific siRNA oligonucleotides and observed after 72 h. B, melanosome clustering was quantified in melan-ink4a cells transfected with non-targeting (NT), GRAB-specific, Rab3GEP-specific, or Mlph-specific siRNA oligonucleotides (n = 2, 100 cells/condition). C, HEK-293 cells were transfected with non-targeting or GRAB-specific siRNA oligonucleotides. After 24 h, cells were transfected with GFP-GRAB and lysed after an additional 24 h. 25 μg of extract was immunoblotted for GFP to detect GFP-GRAB. n.s., a nonspecific band as loading control. D, melan-ink4a cells were transfected with a mixture of siRNA oligonucleotides targeting Rab3 isoforms a, b, c, and d (Rab3a-d) and observed after 72 h. E, melan-ink4a cells were transfected with non-targeting or Rab3a-d specific siRNA oligonucleotides. 72 h after transfection, cells were lysed, and 10 μg of extract was immunoblotted for Rab3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Loss of Rab3GEP Reduces the Levels of Activated Rab27a—To address whether down-regulation of Rab3GEP induces melanosome aggregation by preventing Rab27a activation, we determined the level of endogenous Rab27a in the GTP-bound form in cells transfected either with Rab3GEP siRNA or with control siRNAs. We used the Rab27-binding domain of Slp1, tagged with GST, to pull down Rab27-GTP from cell lysates, followed by immunoblot analysis for Rab27a (19Strom M. Hume A.N. Tarafder A.K. Barkagianni E. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25423-25430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Depletion of Rab3GEP in melanocytes led to a substantial decrease (∼65% of total) in the amount of endogenous Rab27a pulled down by GST-Slp1 compared with treatment with non-targeting or Mlph siRNA (Fig. 4A). This decrease supports a GDP/GTP exchange activity for Rab3GEP on Rab27a. The fraction of Rab27a still interacting with Slp1 (∼35% of total) may result from non-transfected cells (∼20%). Additionally, although the Rab27 binding domain of Slp1 shows preferential interaction with the GTP-bound form of Rab27a, a low level of binding to Rab27a-GDP has also been observed (19Strom M. Hume A.N. Tarafder A.K. Barkagianni E. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25423-25430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Down-regulation of Rab3GEP results in reduced levels of activated Rab27a. A, Rab3GEP-depleted melanocytes contain lower levels of Rab27a in the GTP-bound form. Cell lysates of melan-ink4a melanocytes transfected with either non-targeting (NT), Mlph-specific, or Rab3GEP-specific siRNA oligonucleotides were incubated with GST or GST-Slp11–200 in the presence of glutathione-Sepharose. Rab27a pulled down by GST-Slp1 was detected by immunoblot analysis with antibody to Rab27a. Recombinant GST or GST-Slp1 proteins were visualized by Amido Black staining. Results are representative of three independent experiments. B, reduced levels of melanophilin in Rab3GEP-depleted melanocytes are shown. Melan-ink4a cells were transfected with non-targeting, Mlph-specific, or Rab3GEP-specific siRNA oligonucleotides. After 72 h, cells were homogenized and separated into soluble (S) and pellet (P) fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The presence of melanophilin and calnexin (as a loading control) was analyzed by immunoblotting. C–H, melan-ink4a melanocytes treated with non-targeting (C and F), Mlph-specific (D and G), or Rab3GEP-specific (E and H) siRNA oligonucleotides were fixed 72 h after transfection and labeled with antibodies to Mlph (F–H). Panels C–E show the corresponding phase contrast images. Arrows indicate siRNA-transfected cells. Scale bar = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further examine the activation state of Rab27a in Rab3GEP-depleted cells, we analyzed the expression and subcellular localization of the Rab27 effector Mlph by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence (Fig. 4, B–H). In Rab27a-deficient ashen melanocytes, a dramatic decrease in Mlph levels is observed in comparison with wild-type cells, suggesting that Mlph requires interaction with Rab27a-GTP for stability (23Hume A.N. Ushakov D.S. Tarafder A.K. Ferenczi M.A. Seabra M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3111-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that loss of Rab27-GTP in Rab3GEP-depleted cells would result in Mlph destabilization. Consistent with this, Mlph was no longer detectable in cells depleted of Rab3GEP by immunoblotting (Fig. 4B) or by immunofluorescence (Fig. 4, E and H), similar to what was observed in cells treated with Mlph siRNA (Fig. 4, B, D, and G). These results support the idea that in Rab3GEP-depleted cells, Rab27a is predominantly in the GDP-bound form, precluding interaction with Mlph and resulting in its destabilization.Rab3GEP Is a GEF for Rab27a—To confirm that Rab3GEP does indeed possess Rab27a GEF activity, we performed in vitro GDP/GTP exchange assays with recombinant Rab3GEP produced in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. Rab3GEP was assayed for the ability to stimulate [35S]GTPγS incorporation into bacterially expressed His6-tagged Rab1a, Rab3a, Rab5a, Rab27a, and Rab27b and NusA-His6-Rab8a. Purified Rab3GEP catalyzed the binding of [35S]GTPγS to Rab3a, Rab27a, and Rab27b in a time-dependent manner, but not to Rab1a, Rab5a, and Rab8a (Fig. 5A). This analysis suggests that Rab3GEP is a GEF specific for the related Rab3 and Rab27 subfamilies. We also performed in vitro GDP/GTP exchange assays with recombinant GRAB protein. GRAB showed exchange activity toward Rab3a but did not catalyze nucleotide exchange on Rab27a (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5Recombinant Rab3GEP is a nucleotide exchange factor for Rab27a in vitro. A, His6-Rab1a (□), His6-Rab3a (○), His6-Rab5a (▵), NusA-His6-Rab8a (▾), His6-Rab27a (•), and His6-Rab27b (▪) were incubated with [35S]GTPγS at 30 °C for the indicated periods of time in the presence or absence of recombinant Rab3GEP.

These clamps contain many positively charged residues that could curtail the sliding due to attractive interactions with the negatively charged DNA. By single-molecule spectroscopy we have observed a fluorescently labeled sliding clamp (polymerase III beta subunit or beta clamp) loaded onto freely diffusing, single-stranded M13 circular DNA annealed with fluorescently labeled DNA oligomers of up to 90 bases. We find that the diffusion constant for the beta clamp diffusing along DNA is on the order of 10(-14) m(2)/s, at least 3 orders of magnitude less than that for diffusion through water alone. We also find evidence that the beta clamp remains at the 3' end in the presence of Escherichia coli single-stranded-binding protein. These results may imply that the clamp not only acts to hold the polymerase on the DNA but also prevents excessive drifting along the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2029874081,"7 transmembrane-spanning (7TM) chemokine receptors having multiple endogenous ligands offer special opportunities to understand the molecular basis for allosteric mechanisms. Thus, CC-chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) binds CC-chemokine 3 and 5 (CCL3 and CCL5) with <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> values of 7.3 and 0.16 nm, respectively, as determined in homologous competition binding assays. However, CCL5 appears to have a >10,000-fold lower affinity in competition against <sup>125</sup>I-CCL3. Mutational mapping revealed that CCL3 and CCL5 both are strongly affected by systematic truncations of the N-terminal extension, whereas only CCL5 and not CCL3 activation is affected by substitutions in the main ligand binding pocket including the conserved GluVII:06 anchor point. A series of metal ion chelator complexes were found to act as full agonists on CCR1 and to be critically affected by the same substitutions in the main ligand binding pocket as CCL5 but not by mutations in the extracellular domain. In agreement with the overlapping binding sites, the small non-peptide agonists displaced radiolabeled CCL5 with high affinity. Interestingly, the same compounds acted as allosteric enhancers of the binding of CCL3, with which they did not overlap in binding site, leading to an increased B<sub>max</sub> and affinity of this chemokine mainly due to an increased association rate. It is concluded that a small molecule agonist through binding deep in the main ligand binding pocket can act as an allosteric enhancer for one endogenous chemokine and at the same time as a competitive blocker of the binding of another endogenous chemokine."
https://openalex.org/W2119657138,"Recombinant adenovirus (Ad) is a powerful tool in gene therapy. However, the ability to deliver Ad by systemic administration is limited due to rapid clearance from blood circulation, transfection of nontarget tissues, toxicity, and immunogenicity. To address these limitations, we developed an artificially enveloped Ad vector prepared by self-assembly of lipid bilayers around the Ad capsid. The physicochemical and structural features of the enveloped Ad vector can be altered according to the type of lipid used without the need for genetic modification or conjugation chemistry. Here we engineered 4 different types of artificially enveloped Ad using cationic, neutral, fusogenic, and PEGylated lipids to form the envelopes and obtained extended blood circulation times following i.v. administration and reduced vector immunogenicity. Moreover, the PEGylated lipid-enveloped Ad was capable of specifically delivering genes via the systemic circulation to solid tumors subcutaneously implanted in the absence of high levels of gene transfer to the liver and spleen. This provides the basis for the development of a novel vector platform for systemic delivery of Ad to disseminated targets. Furthermore, the artificial envelopment of Ad presented herein is an illustration of a general strategy to modulate the biological function of nonenveloped viruses and may have implications broader than gene therapy."

Previous studies have established that HFR1 protein is degraded in darkness and is stabilized under light conditions to promote light signaling. How light regulates HFR1 stability is not well understood. In this study, we show that Arabidopsis HFR1 can be phosphorylated by recombinant casein kinase II (CKII) and plant extract in vitro and that phosphorylation of HFR1 can be effectively reduced by treatments with two CKII-specific inhibitors, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole (DRB) and heparin. We demonstrate that HFR1 physically interacts with the CKB1 and CKB2 regulatory subunits of CKII. Mutagenesis studies indicate that HFR1 is phosphorylated at multiple serine (Ser) residues in the N-terminal regulatory domain of HFR1. We also show that phosphorylation of HFR1 is promoted by light and that a predicted CKII site, Ser122, represents a major phosphorylation site of HFR1 under both dark and light conditions. Comparison of wild-type, phosphorylation-deficient, and phosphorylation-mimic mutant proteins suggests that phosphorylation acts to reduce the degradation rate of HFR1.

Phytochromes have been well characterized for their roles in regulating seedling de-etiolation and mediating shade-avoidance response. In response to light, Arabidopsis seedlings develop short hypocotyls, with open and expanded cotyledons, and differentiated chloroplasts (4McNellis T.W. Deng X.W. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1749-11761Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). During vegetative growth, plants use phytochromes to measure the R/FR ratios in their surroundings. Under a canopy, light is depleted of red but not far-red wavelengths, thus lowering the R/FR ratio. By sensing this change in light quality, plants initiate the shade-avoidance response by increasing the elongation growth of petioles and stems, the length-to-width ratio of leaves, and accelerating flowering (5Smith H. Whitelam G.C. Plant Cell Environ. 1997; 20: 840-844Crossref Scopus (516) Google Scholar).

However, the molecular mechanisms by which light regulates HFR1 stability and functionality remain largely unknown. Although the abundance of nuclear COP1 is diminished through a light-mediated nuclear exclusion mechanism, the kinetics of COP1 nuclear depletion is very slow (taking up to 24 h) (18Von Arnim A.G. Deng X.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 1035-1045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In addition, nuclear accumulation of SPA1 protein increases significantly upon light exposure (19Fittinghoff K. Laubinger S. Nixdorf M. Fackendahl P. Baumgardt R.L. Batschauer A. Hoecker U.

In this study, we show that Arabidopsis HFR1 is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo. We present multiple lines of evidence to support the notion that CKII is a cognate kinase responsible for HFR1 phosphorylation. We demonstrate that HFR1 is phosphorylated at multiple serine (Ser) residues in the N-terminal regulatory domain of HFR1 and that a predicted CKII site, Ser122, is a major phosphorylation site of HFR1 under both dark and light conditions. We also show that phosphorylation of HFR1 is promoted by light. Using an in vitro degradation assay, we gathered evidence to support the proposition that phosphorylation acts to reduce the degradation rate of HFR1, thus contributing to the regulation of HFR1 stability and signaling activity.

Hoecker U. Liu B. Xu L. Deng X.W. Wang H. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 804-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The CKB4 overexpression line was described in Ref. 20Perles M. Portolés S.

The CKB1 overexpression transgenic plants were generated in-house, and detailed characterization will be reported elsewhere. 4M. Dai and H. Wang, unpublished results. Plasmid Construction—To generate various GFP-HFR1 fusion protein constructs, the plasmid pRTL2-GFP-HFR1 (15Yang J. Lin R. Sullivan J. Hoecker U. Liu B. Xu L. Deng X.W. Wang H. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 804-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) was used as the template for mutagenesis using a QuikChange Multi Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The primers used are: S28A and S33A: 5′-gatcagggcatgatggcagaaagagcaagagctgatgaagatcgtctaatc-3′; S84A: 5′-gtccctgatgaacatgctgaaactgatgatcatc-3′; S121A, S122A, and S126A: 5′-cgtatccaggtcttagctgctgatgatgaagcggaggagtttacaagag-3′; S171A: 5′-caagacggacaaggttgcggttctcgacaagacc-3′; S28E and S33E: 5′-gatcagggcatgatggaagaaagagcaagagaagatgaagatcgtctaatc-3′; S84E: 5′-gtccctgatgaacatgaagaaactgatgatcatc-3′; S121E and S126E: 5′-cgtatccaggtcttagaaagtgatgatgaagaggaggagtttacaagag-3′; S122E: 5′-gtatccaggtcttaagtgaagatgatgaatcggagg-3′; S171E: 5′-caagacggacaaggttgaggttctcgacaagacc-3′. To construct the GST-NT131 and various mutant protein expression plasmids, NT131 fragments of HFR1 (containing N-terminal 131 amino acids, wild-type and mutant forms) were amplified by PCR using the pRTL2-GFP-HFR1 wild-type and mutant plasmids as templates. The primers used are HFR1-1F (5′-gagagatctgaattcatgtcgaataatcaagctttc-3′) and HFR1–131R (5′-ggctctagactcgagtcatcttgtaaactcctccgattc-3′). The purified PCR products were inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate pGEM-NT131 (wild-type and mutant forms). The inserts were then released by BglII and XbaI digestion and ligated into BglII/XbaI-digested pGEX 4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Sunnyvale, CA) to generate pGEX-NT131 (wild-type and mutant forms). To construct the bait and prey plasmids for the yeast two-hybrid assay, an EcoRI and XhoI fragment of HFR1 was released from pJG-HFR1 (15Yang J. Lin R. Sullivan J. Hoecker U. Liu B. Xu L. Deng X.W. Wang H. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 804-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the DNA binding domain containing yeast two-hybrid vector pBD-GAL4 Cam (Stratagene) at EcoRI and SalI sites, producing BD-HFR1. Full-length cDNAs of CKA1 (At5g67380), CKA2 (At3g50000), CKB1 (At5g47080), and CKB2 (At4g17640) were amplified by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR from wild-type Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia), and cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector to generate pGEM-CKA1, pGEM-CKA2, pGEM-CKB1, and pGEM-CKB2. The CKA and CKB fragments were then released from their respective pGEM plasmids by digestion with BamHI and XhoI, and the released fragments were cloned into the activation domain containing yeast two-hybrid vector pAD-GAL4–2.1 (Stratagene) at BamHI and XhoI sites, giving rise to GAD-CKA1, GAD-CKA2, GAD-CKB1, and GAD-CKB2. To construct the various plasmids for the subcellular co-localization assay, HFR1 was released from yy64-HFR1 5H. Park and H. Wang, unpublished results. by digestion with BglII and SalI and then subcloned into the pSAT6-ECFP-C1 vector (21Tzfira T. Tian G.W. Lacroix B. Vyas S. Li J. Leitner-Dagan Y. Krichevsky A. Taylor T. Vainstein A. Citovsky V. Plant Mol. Biol. 2005; 57: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) at BglII and SalI sites to generate pSAT6-CFP-HFR1. The BamHI-XhoI fragment of CKB1 and CKB2 was released from pGEM-CKB1 and pGEM-CKB2 and cloned into the pSAT6-EYFP-C1 vector (21Tzfira T. Tian G.W. Lacroix B. Vyas S. Li J. Leitner-Dagan Y. Krichevsky A. Taylor T. Vainstein A. Citovsky V. Plant Mol. Biol. 2005; 57: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) at BglII and SalI sites to generate pSAT6-YFP-CKB1 and pSAT6-YFP-CKB2, respectively. To generate 3HA-tagged full-length HFR1 wild type, A5, and E5 mutant constructs, HFR1, A5 and E5 were amplified by PCR using pRTL2-HFR1, pRTL2-A5, or pRTL2-E5 as the templates respectively. The primers used were HFR1–1F (5′-gagagatctgaattcatgtcgaataatcaagctttc-3′) and HFR1–292R (5′-ggctctagactcgagtcatagtcttctcatcgcatgggaag-3′). The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and then subcloned into the pSAT6–3HA vector 4M. Dai and H. Wang, unpublished results. at EcoRI and SalI sites to generate pSAT6-HFR1–3HA, pSAT6-A5-3HA, and pSAT6-E5-3HA, respectively. All PCR products generated in this study were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Preparation of GST-NT131 Wild-type and Mutant Fusion Proteins—The pGEX-NT131 plasmids (wild-type and mutant forms) were transformed into the bacterial strain BL21 (DE3). To prepare bacterial extract, the transformed cells were inoculated in LB and grown overnight. The culture was diluted (1:100) in fresh medium and cultured at 37 °C until the cell A600 is 0.8. The cells were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 25 °C and harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of 1× PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed with a French Press. The cell lysate was applied on the glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (1× PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100), and bound proteins were eluted with an elution buffer (50 mm Tri-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm glutathione). Transient Gene Expression in Onion Epidermal Cells—The procedure for transient expression in living onion epidermal cells using particle bombardment was described previously (15Yang J. Lin R. Sullivan J. Hoecker U. Liu B. Xu L. Deng X.W. Wang H. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 804-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). For the co-localization assay, 15 μg of CFP-HFR1 plasmid DNA and the same amount of YFP-CKB1 or YFP-CKB2 were co-coated on tungsten particles and bombarded into onion epidermal cells, and incubated overnight before observation. Fluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—For observing co-localization of CFP-HFR1 with YFP-CKB1 and YFP-CKB2 in onion epidermal cells, transformed onion epidermal peels were examined and recorded using a LEICA TCS SP5 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (458-nm argon laser for ECFP and 514-nm argon laser for EYFP). Overlay of CFP and YFP images were generated using Image J software. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—BD-HFR1 (or the empty vector control pBD-GAL4 Cam) was co-transformed into the yeast strain PJ69-4A with GAD-CKA1, GAD-CKA2, GAD-CKB1, and GAD-CKB2, or the empty AD vector pAD-GAL4-2.1, respectively. Yeast cells were selected on Leu- Trp- drop-off media and then patched onto His- plus 0.05 mg/liter Ade medium. The yeast cells were allowed to grow for 4–8 days. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—For the in vitro phosphorylation assay using plant extracts as the kinase source, Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in the desired light conditions for 4–5 days and then harvested and frozen in liquid N2. Then the seedlings (∼1 g) were homogenized in 1 ml of CKII assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The extracted protein solution was spun down at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was transferred into a new tube, and protein concentrations of the extracts were measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For 40 μl of reaction mixture, we combined 10–30 μg of plant extracts, 3–5 μg of substrate proteins, 20 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32p]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Science) in the CKII assay buffer. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, then 10 μl of 5× SDS-sample buffer (1×: 0.0625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue) was added, and the sample boiled for 3 min. Then the samples were separated on 11% SDS-PAGE and examined by autoradiography. Phosphorylation signals were quantified with a Storm Scanner (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For the in vitro phosphorylation assay using recombinant kinases, the human glioblastoma recombinant CKII (α2β2 tetrameric holoenzyme), CKI (rat testis), and protein kinase A (PKA, murine PKA catalytic subunit) were purchased from NEB (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). 25 units of CKI or CKII, or 150 units of PKA were used for the phosphorylation assay of GST-NT131. Protoplast Transient Expression and Dephosphorylation Assay—Isolation of Arabidopsis protoplast and polyethylene glycol-mediated transfection were performed as described (22Kovtun Y. Chiu W.-L. Tena G. Sheen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). After transformation, the protoplasts were incubated under darkness or weak light conditions for 12–15 h. Then the protoplasts were spun down at 100–200 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was removed. Next, an equal volume of 2× protoplast extraction buffer (2× λ-PPase buffer from NEB, 4 mm MnCl2, 2% Triton X-100, 2× complete protease inhibitor mixture) was added to the protoplast pellets, and the protoplasts were resuspended by vortexing for several seconds. The protoplast solution was incubated on ice for 5 min, then aliquoted into three separate tubes (25–30 μl each). 1 μl of λ-PPase was added to one of the tubes. 1 μl of λ-PPase plus 10 mm of a broad-band phosphatase inhibitor Na2VO3 were added to another tube. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Then the samples were mixed with 8 μl of 5× SDS-sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and separated by NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen). As previously indicated, NuPAGE gel provides better resolution for discriminating phosphorylated versus unphosphorylated forms of proteins, compared to a homemade SDS-PAGE gel (23Shalitin D. Yang H. Mockler T.C. Maymon M. Guo H. Whitelam G.C. Lin C. Nature. 2002; 417: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Then the GFP-HFR1 protein was detected with immunoblot using anti-GFP antibodies (Invitrogen). In Vitro Degradation Assay—In vitro degradation assay was performed essentially as previously described (24Osterlund M.T. Hardtke C. Wei N. Deng X.W. Nature. 2000; 405: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 25Valverde F. Mouradov A. Soppe W. Ravenscroft D. Samach A. Coupland G. Science. 2004; 303: 1003-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For degradation of the GST-NT131, GST-A5, and GST-E5 recombinant proteins, plant extracts were prepared from 5-day-old dark-grown seedlings, grounded in liquid nitrogen, and resuspended in a cell-free degradation assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaCl, and 10 mm ATP). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation before adding to the recombinant proteins. Then equal amounts (∼300 μg) of plant extracts were added to the recombinant protein samples (5 μg) (total reaction volume 110 μl). The reaction mixtures were incubated in darkness, and 20 μl of reaction mixture was taken at different time points: 0, 20, 40, 60, or 120 min, into new tubes containing 5 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer to stop the degradation process. Then, the samples were boiled for 3 min and separated on 11% SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-HFR1 polyclonal antibodies (15Yang J. Lin R. Sullivan J. Hoecker U. Liu B. Xu L. Deng X.W. Wang H. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 804-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). For the cell-free degradation assay with full-length HFR1–3HA, A5-3HA, and E5-3HA fusion proteins, the pSAT6-HFR1–3HA, pSAT6-A5-3HA, and pSAT6-E5-3HA plasmids were individually transfected into Arabidopsis protoplasts to transiently express the HFR1–3HA, A5-3HA, and E5-3HA fusion proteins. After incubation in darkness for 12 h, the expressed proteins were extracted with 2× protoplast cell-free degradation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaCl, and 20 mm ATP, 2% Triton X-100). The extracted proteins were used for degradation assay by adding equal amounts of plant extracts prepared from 5-day-old dark-grown seedlings as described above. The degradation assay was performed as described above for the recombinant proteins, and the fusion proteins were detected via immunoblot using anti-HA-specific antibodies (Roche Applied Science). HFR1 Can Be Phosphorylated by CKII and Plant Extracts in Vitro—A recent study reported that HFR1 is a phosphoprotein in vivo (13Duek P.D. Elmer M.V. van Oosten V.R. Fankhauser C. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2296-2301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); however, the phosphorylation site(s) is unknown, and the responsible kinase(s) remains to be identified. Sequence analysis revealed that HFR1 contains five predicted CKII phosphorylation sites (see below). Thus, we first tested whether recombinant CKII can phosphorylate HFR1 in vitro. An N-terminal 131-amino acid fragment of HFR1 (NT131) was selected for this assay as this domain was previously shown to be responsible for interacting with COP1 and is the regulatory domain of HFR1 stability (13Duek P.D. Elmer M.V. van Oosten V.R. Fankhauser C. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2296-2301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 14Jang I.-C. Yang J.-Y. Seo H.S. Chua N.H. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 15Yang J. Lin R. Sullivan J. Hoecker U. Liu B. Xu L. Deng X.W. Wang H. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 804-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Second, this domain contains four of five predicted CKII phosphorylation sites. NT131 of HFR1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as a GST fusion protein (GST-NT131). This fusion protein was used as the substrate for an in vitro phosphorylation assay in the CKII buffer containing [γ32-p]ATP. GST-NT131 has no autophosphorylation activity, but can be effectively phosphorylated by recombinant CKII and slightly phosphorylated by casein kinase I (CKI). However, PKA is not effective in phosphorylating HFR1. As previously reported (26Hardtke C.S. Gohda K. Osterlund M.T. Oyama T. Okada K. Deng X.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4997-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), GST-HY5 was also phosphorylated by CKII, whereas GST itself was not phosphorylated by CKII (Fig. 1A). Next, we tested whether the GST-NT131 recombinant protein can be phosphorylated by plant extracts in vitro. GST-NT131 can be effectively phosphorylated by plant extracts from light-grown seedlings, using [γ32-p]GTP as the phosphate donor. Boiling of the plant extracts before adding to the phosphorylation assay completely abolished HFR1 phosphorylation. Moreover, addition of a CKII-specific inhibitor, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole (DRB), effectively inhibited HFR1 phosphorylation in a dosage-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Further, heparin, another potent and CKII-specific inhibitor, also effectively blocked HFR1 phosphorylation by plant extracts (Fig. 1C). The capacity to use both [γ32-p]ATP and [γ32-p]GTP as the phosphate donors, which is a characteristic of CKII kinase, and the inhibition of HFR1 phosphorylation by DRB and heparin, strongly support that CKII could be a bona fide kinase responsible for phosphorylation of HFR1 in vivo. CKII Subunits Physically Interact with HFR1—The CKII holoenzyme that has been purified from many different eukaryotes is generally a tetrameric complex formed by two catalytic subunits (α) and two regulatory subunits (β), with a molecular mass of ∼130 kDa (27Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, there are four genes (CKA1-CKA4) encoding the α subunits of CKII and four genes (CKB1-CKB4) encoding the β subunits of CKII. It is believed that the β subunits of CKII are inactive by themselves, but they can stimulate CKIIα catalytic activity, confer stability to the enzyme, and provide specificity for the interactions with substrates and inhibitors (28Riera M. Peracchia G. Pages M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2001; 227: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To investigate whether HFR1 physically interacts with CKII, we have cloned two α subunits (CKA1 and CKA2) and two β subunits (CKB1 and CKB2) as fusions with the GAL4 activation domain (GAD-CKII) and tested their interaction with HFR1 that is fused with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DB-HFR1), using a yeast two-hybrid assay. We selected these CKII subunits for this assay as they are localized in the nucleus as HFR1 (15Yang J. Lin R. Sullivan J. Hoecker U. Liu B. Xu L. Deng X.W. Wang H. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 804-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 29Salinas P. Fuentes D. Vidal E. Jordana X. Echeverria M. Holuigue L. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Both the CKB1 and CKB2 subunits interact with HFR1, judging from the yeast growth on a selection plate that lacks histidine (a selective marker for the HIS3 reporter gene expression) (Fig. 2A). No physical interaction was detected between HFR1 with the CKA1 and CKA2 subunits of CKII (data not shown). To confirm the observed physical interaction between HFR1 with CKB1 and CKB2 in yeast, we performed a subcellular co-localization assay in planta. The CKB1 and CKB2 subunits were tagged with yellow fluorescence protein (YFP-CKB1/2) and co-expressed with a cyan fluorescence protein (CFP)-tagged HFR1 (CFP-HFR1) in onion epidermal cells. Both CFP-HFR1 and YFP-CKB1/2 are localized into the nucleus, and above a uniform nucleoplasm distribution, these fusion proteins also form distinct speckle-like nuclear bodies that overlay with each other (Fig. 2B), indicating that CFP-HFR1 and YFP-CKB1/2 co-localize in the nucleus. This observation provides strong supporting evidence for the in vivo interaction between HFR1 and CKB1/2. To further test the in vivo functional relationship between CKII and HFR1, we examined the phosphorylation efficiencies of HFR1 by plant extract from CKB1 and CKB4 overexpression transgenic plants. The degrees of GST-NT131 phosphorylation were significantly higher when incubated with plant extracts from light-grown CKB1 and CKB4 overexpression transgenic plants, compared with wild-type plant extract (Fig. 2C). This result further supports that CKII acts as the cognate kinase for phosphorylating HFR1 in vivo. HFR1 Is Phosphorylated at Multiple Serine Residues in Vivo—To identify the phosphorylation sites of HFR1, we transiently overexpressed GFP-HFR1 protein (driven by the constitutive 35S mosaic virus promoter) in Arabidopsis protoplasts using a PEG-mediated transfection method (22Kovtun Y. Chiu W.-L. Tena G. Sheen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). After incubating under dark or weak light conditions for 12 h, the protein was extracted and treated with λ-PPase in the presence or absence of a phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4). After separation using NuPAGE gel, the proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and probed with anti-GFP antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, treatment with λ-PPase caused the GFP-HFR1 protein to shift into a faster migrating band, and this migration shift was inhibited by Na3VO4. This result suggests that GFP-HFR1 is indeed phosphorylated in vivo. We concluded that the faster migrating form represents dephosphorylated HFR1, wh"
https://openalex.org/W2018589503,"ID1, inhibitor of differentiation/DNA binding, plays an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumorigenesis. It has been shown that ID1 is de-regulated in multiple cancers and up-regulation of ID1 is correlated with high grades and poor prognosis of human cancers. In contrast, the p53 tumor suppressor was found to be mutated or inactivated in most human cancers and loss of p53 results in early onset of multiple cancers. Although the biological functions of the ID1 oncogene and the p53 tumor suppressor have been intensively investigated, little is known about the upstream regulators of ID1 and the cross-talk between ID1 and p53. Here, we showed that ID1 is down-regulated in cells treated with various DNA damage agents in a p53-dependent manner. Interestingly, we found that DEC1, which was recently identified as a p53 target and mediates p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and senescence, is capable of inhibiting ID1 expression. Conversely, we found that knockdown of DEC1 attenuates DNA damage-induced ID1 repression. In addition, we identified several potential DEC1 responsive elements in the proximal promoter region of the ID1 gene. Moreover, we showed that overexpression of ID1 or ID1', an isoform of ID1, promotes cell proliferation potentially through inhibition of p21 expression. Finally, we found that the extent of DNA damage-induced premature senescence was substantially decreased by overexpression of ID1 or ID1'. Taken together, our study suggests that p53 trans-repressional activity can be mediated by its own target DEC1 and ID1 is an effector of the p53-dependent DNA damage response pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2010988411,"One of the major complications of diabetes is the alteration of the blood-retinal barrier, leading to retinal edema and consequent vision loss. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)/uPA receptor (uPAR) system in the regulation of retinal vascular permeability. Biochemical, molecular, and histological techniques were used to examine the role of uPA and uPAR in the regulation of retinal vascular permeability in diabetic rats and cultured retinal endothelial cells. The increased retinal vascular permeability in diabetic rats was associated with a decrease in vascular endothelial (VE) -cadherin expression in retinal vessels. Treatment with the uPA/uPAR-inhibiting peptide (A6) was shown to reduce diabetes-induced permeability and the loss of VE-cadherin. The increased permeability of cultured cells in response to advanced glycation end products (AGEs) was significantly inhibited with A6. Treatment of endothelial cells with specific matrix metalloproteinases or AGEs resulted in loss of VE-cadherin from the cell surface, which could be inhibited by A6. uPA/uPAR physically interacts with AGEs/receptor for advanced glycation end products on the cell surface and regulates its activity. uPA and its receptor uPAR play important roles in the alteration of the blood-retinal barrier through proteolytic degradation of VE-cadherin. The ability of A6 to block retinal vascular permeability in diabetes suggests a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of diabetic macular edema."
https://openalex.org/W2013268349,"A subset of methanogenic archaea synthesize the cysteinyl-tRNACys (Cys-tRNACys) needed for protein synthesis using both a canonical cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CysRS) as well as a set of two enzymes that operate via a separate indirect pathway. In the indirect route, phosphoseryl-tRNACys (Sep-tRNACys) is first synthesized by phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase (SepRS), and this misacylated intermediate is then converted to Cys-tRNACys by Sep-tRNA:Cys-tRNA synthase (SepCysS) via a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent mechanism. Here, we explore the function of all three enzymes in the mesophilic methanogen Methanosarcina mazei. The genome of M. mazei also features three distinct tRNACys isoacceptors, further indicating the unusual and complex nature of Cys-tRNACys synthesis in this organism. Comparative aminoacylation kinetics by M. mazei CysRS and SepRS reveals that each enzyme prefers a distinct tRNACys isoacceptor or pair of isoacceptors. Recognition determinants distinguishing the tRNAs are shown to reside in the globular core of the molecule. Both enzymes also require the S-adenosylmethione-dependent formation of m1G37 in the anticodon loop for efficient aminoacylation. We further report a new, highly sensitive assay to measure the activity of SepCysS under anaerobic conditions. With this approach, we demonstrate that SepCysS functions as a multiple-turnover catalyst with kinetic behavior similar to bacterial selenocysteine synthase and the archaeal/eukaryotic SepSecS enzyme. Together, these data suggest that both metabolic routes and all three tRNACys species in M. mazei play important roles in the cellular physiology of the organism.

Methanosarcina mazei strain Gö1 is a methanogenic archaeon capable of utilizing a broad spectrum of growth substrates, including H2/CO2, acetate, methanol, and methylamines (1Deppenmeier U.

The capacity of M. mazei to adapt to changing environmental conditions is a hallmark of the Methanosarcina. Organisms belonging to this genus coexist with fermenting bacteria in freshwater and marine sediments, where their capacity to metabolically transform bacterially produced acetate into methane forms a closed carbon cycle that helps to determine atmospheric levels of this greenhouse gas (2Hippe H.

In some marine environments, the Methanosarcina also flourish together with methanotrophs and sulfate-reducing bacteria, where they participate in a microbial community that generates very high sulfate reduction rates via anaerobic methane oxidation (3Boetius A. Ravenschlag K. Schubert C.J. Rickert D. Widdel F. Gleseke A. Amann R. Jergensen B.B. Witte U. Pfannkuche O. Nature. 2000; 407: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar). Comparative genomic studies of M. mazei, Methanosarcina barkeri, and Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A, the three Methanosarcina for which complete sequences are available, show that the 4.1-megabase M. mazei genome is the smallest so far known in the genus and may approximate the ancestral state (1Deppenmeier U.

Of the 3371 M. mazei open reading frames identified, 1043 find their closest homolog in the bacterial domain (1Deppenmeier U. Johann A. Hartsch T. Merkl R. Schmitz R.A. Martinez-Arias R. Henne A.

Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 4: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that horizontal gene transfer has played an important evolutionary role in the development of the organism.The distinguishing methanogenesis pathway, present in all methanogens, produces methane as a catabolic product while also generating an electrochemical gradient that is harnessed to synthesize ATP (5Galagan J.E. Nusbaum C. Roy A. Endrizzi M.G. Macdonald P. FitzHugh W. Calvo S. Engels R. Smirnov S. Atnoor D. Brown A. Allen N. Naylor J. Stange-Thomann N. DeArellano K. et al.Genome Res. 2002; 12: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 6Deppenmeier U. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 223-383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Methanogens also possess many subsidiary metabolic activities that function to directly support methane production, including those involved in cofactor biosynthesis and in energy transduction through proton and sodium gradients (6Deppenmeier U. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 223-383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, genomic data reveal a further correlation; all but two methanogens for which full sequence information is available also possess a unique two-step pathway by which cysteine is incorporated into proteins (7Sauerwald A. Zhu W. Major T. Roy H. Palioura S. Jahn D. Whitman W.B. Yates III, J.R. Ibba M. Soll D. Science. 2005; 307: 1969-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In this pathway, tRNACys is first aminoacylated with the nonstandard amino acid phosphoserine by phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase (SepRS). 2The abbreviations used are: SepRSphosphoseryl-tRNA synthetaseSep-CysSSep-tRNA:Cys-tRNA synthaseSep-tRNACysphosphoseryl-tRNACysCysRScysteinyl-tRNA synthetaseDTTdithiothreitolPLPpyridoxal phosphateβMEβ-mercaptoethanol. 2The abbreviations used are: SepRSphosphoseryl-tRNA synthetaseSep-CysSSep-tRNA:Cys-tRNA synthaseSep-tRNACysphosphoseryl-tRNACysCysRScysteinyl-tRNA synthetaseDTTdithiothreitolPLPpyridoxal phosphateβMEβ-mercaptoethanol. The misacylated Sep-tRNACys is then converted to Cys-tRNACys through the action of the PLP-dependent enzyme SepCysS. For some methanogens, which lack a canonical cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CysRS), this indirect route is the sole pathway to synthesis of Cys-tRNACys. However, other methanogens, including all three Methanosarcina for which genome sequences are available, possess both pathways. Comparative phylogenetic studies have shown that both the direct CysRS route and the indirect two-step pathway were in existence at the time of the last universal common ancestor (8O'Donoghue P. Sethi A. Woese C.R. Luthey-Schulten Z.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 19003-19008Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The coincident phylogenetic distributions of SepRS/SepCysS and the enzymes of methanogenesis also suggest the existence of a linkage between primary energy production and protein synthesis in contemporary methanogens, although the nature of and biological rationale for such a linkage have so far been obscure (8O'Donoghue P. Sethi A. Woese C.R. Luthey-Schulten Z.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 19003-19008Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The only nonmethanogen known to possess the two-step Cys-tRNACys biosynthetic pathway is the hyperthermophilic sulfate-reducing archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus, a closely related archaeon that retains nearly all of the methanogenesis enzymes and cofactors needed for the hydrogenotrophic pathway, with the exception of the essential methyl-CoM reductase (9Klenk H.-P. Clayton R.A. Tomb J.F. White O. Nelson K.E. Ketchum K.A. Dodson R.J. Gwinn M. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Richardson D.L. Kerlavage A.R. Graham D.E. Kyrpides N.C. Fleischmann R.D. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar).Recently, it was reported that SepRS and CysRS from Methanococcus maripaludis share major identity elements for heterologous aminoacylation of an unmodified, in vitro transcript corresponding to the single tRNACys species present in the M. jannaschii genome (10Hohn M.J. Park H.S. O'Donoghue P. Schnitzbauer M. Soll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 18095-18100Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Consistent with other studies in which a common tRNA is recognized by distinct tRNA synthetases, these data were interpreted to support a general hypothesis that aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases evolved in the context of preestablished tRNA identity. Other work on the M. jannaschii pathway has shown that SepRS and SepCysS form a stable binary complex that assists in conversion of the intermediate Sep-tRNACys to Cys-tRNACys, a complex reminiscent of the transamidosome particle that facilitates prokaryotic tRNA-dependent asparagine biosynthesis (11Zhang C.-M. Liu C. Slater S. Hou Y.-M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Bailly M. Blaise M. Lorber B. Becker H.D. Kern D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 228-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Here, we sought to address distinct questions pertaining to the contemporary function of apparently redundant Cys-tRNACys synthesis pathways in M. mazei. Both M. mazei and M. barkeri possess genes encoding three distinct isoacceptors of tRNACys, a feature not known in other bacteria or archaea and suggestive that the machinery for incorporation of cysteine into proteins in these organisms may interact with other cellular components (1Deppenmeier U. Johann A. Hartsch T. Merkl R. Schmitz R.A. Martinez-Arias R. Henne A. Wiezer A. Bäumer S. Jacobi C. Brüggemann H. Lienard T. Christmann A. Bömeke M. Steckel S. Bhattacharyya A. Lykidis A.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 19003-19008Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). By examining aminoacylation of the three wild-type as well as a set of hybrid tRNACys species as substrates for either CysRS or the combined SepRS/SepCysS pathway, we show that each enzyme prefers a distinct tRNACys isoacceptor or pair of isoacceptors and that the nucleotides determining CysRS versus SepRS selectivity among tRNACys species are located in the globular core of the tRNA. Through the development and application of a new anaerobic assay for the quantitative analysis of SepCysS kinetics, we also provide evidence that the tRNACys isoacceptor preferences of SepRS and SepCysS are identical. This supports the notion that tRNACys acceptors functioning in the two-step pathway could be efficiently shuttled between these two enzymes. Together, these findings suggest that both pathways may play an important role in the cellular physiology. We also show that the aminoacylation efficiency of M. mazei CysRS is very significantly enhanced by the addition of a methyl group to the N1 position of G37 by the S-adenosylmethione-dependent Trm5 enzyme, consistent with a similar dependence found for SepRS (11Zhang C.-M. Liu C. Slater S. Hou Y.-M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Hauenstein S. Hou Y.-M. Perona J.J. J. Biol.

Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the tRNACys methylation requirement for aminoacylation by both CysRS and SepRS links protein synthesis with sulfur metabolism in this organism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression, Purification, and Quaternary Structure Determination of M. mazei CysRS and SepCysS—M. mazei genomic DNA was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and used as template for PCR amplification of the CysRS and SepCysS open reading frames. For SepCysS, the resulting DNA fragments were digested with NdeI and XhoI and inserted into pet22b+ for expression of His-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli Rosetta2(DE3) pLysS cells. Cultures were grown aerobically at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 0.01% pyridoxine. When the cultures reached an A600 of 0.5, expression of His-tagged protein was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.6 mm. Cultures were then grown for a further 5 h at 37 °C prior to harvesting.Cells expressing SepCysS were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 20 mm NaCl, 3 mm DTT, 20 μm PLP, and 10% glycerol and were disrupted by a French press. Under aerobic conditions, the clarified lysate was applied to a 30-ml DEAE column preequilibrated with 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 20 mm NaCl, 3 mm DTT, and 20 μm PLP. SepCysS was eluted with a gradient from 20–500 mm NaCl, and the pooled fractions were dialyzed into a solution containing 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm βME, and 20 μm PLP. The enzyme was then applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column preequilibrated with 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm βME, and 20 μm PLP. Fractions containing SepCysS were then directly applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated with 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm βME, and 20 μm PLP. After washing of the column in this buffer, the enzyme was then eluted by the addition of 150 mm imidazole. The enzyme was then dialyzed into a solution containing 10 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm βME, 100 μm PLP, and 50% glycerol and stored at -20 °C. His-tagged SepCysS was recovered at better than 95% purity as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, at a yield of 2 mg of protein/liter of culture. The PLP content of SepCysS was verified using a colorimetric assay in which the titration of PLP released upon boiling is monitored (15Wada H. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2089-2095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Construction of the recombinant DNA vector, induction of enzyme expression, and purification of M. mazei CysRS were accomplished by procedures identical to those described for M. mazei SepRS (13Hauenstein S. Hou Y.-M. Perona J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21997-22006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The yield of highly purified CysRS was ∼5 mg of protein/liter of culture.The oligomeric structures of CysRS and SepCysS were determined by analytic size exclusion chromatography, using conditions and molecular mass markers identical to those reported in the accompanying paper (13Hauenstein S. Hou Y.-M. Perona J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21997-22006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The 473-amino acid M. mazei CysRS enzyme (calculated Mr = 53,861) exhibits 40.2% sequence identity with the monomeric E. coli CysRS and migrates as a monomer, as expected. M. mazei SepCysS belongs to the PLP-dependent superfamily of enzymes, which typically function as dimers with one molecule of PLP bound in each active site (16Eliot A.C. Kirsch J.F. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 383-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). As expected, the 386-amino acid enzyme (predicted Mr = 42,324 Da) elutes at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of 84 kDa, consistent with dimer formation (13Hauenstein S. Hou Y.-M.

To remove unmethylated transcripts, the 16-mer oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to the tRNA sequence flanking nucleotide G37 were as follows: tRNA1Cys, 5′-mUmGmAmAmUmCmGmCTCTGmCmUmGmG-3′; tRNA2Cys and tRNA3Cys, 5′-mGmGmUmAmUmCmGmCTCTGmCmAmGmG-3′ (where “m” indicates a 2′-O-methyl ribose modification). Individual tRNACys isoacceptors are depicted in Fig. 1B.Steady-state Aminoacylation Kinetics—SepRS plateau aminoacylation levels and assays to determine steady-state kinetic parameters were carried out using tRNA 32P-labeled at the 3′-internucleotide linkage, using the methodology reported in the accompanying paper (13Hauenstein S.

Measurements of aminoacylation by CysRS with all tRNACys species were performed with a conventional assay that tracks incorporation of 35S-labeled cysteine into tRNA, as described (18Hou Y.-M. Westof E. Giege R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6776-6780Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Saturation for tRNA was not observed in any CysRS reaction, limiting the analysis to determination of kcat/Km. kcat/Km was derived by fitting initial velocities to the following linear relation, (V/(S))/[E]t=kcat/Km(Eq. 1) where (v/S) is the slope of the linear fit, and [E]t is the enzyme concentration. Errors are reported in Tables 1, 2, 3 as the mean and S.D. values of at least two measurements.TABLE 1Determinants of tRNA specificity in CysRS and SepRSSepRSCysRSkcatKmkcat/Kmpmol/ODkcatKmkcat/Kmakcat/Km values were determined from initial velocities using the relation, ν = kcat/Km[E][S]pmol/ODSpecificitybSpecificity for each tRNA is determined as the ratio, kcat/Km(SEPRS)/kcat/Km(CYSRS)s–1μms–1 m–1s–1μms–1 m–1tRNA1CyscStructures of the M. mazei isoacceptors tRNA1Cys, tRNA2Cys, and tRNA3Cys are shown in Fig. 1B0.12 ± 0.016.4 ± 0.2(2.0 ± 0.3) × 1041250 ± 60>0.17>802070 ± 33780 ± 509.5tRNA2CyscStructures of the M. mazei isoacceptors tRNA1Cys, tRNA2Cys, and tRNA3Cys are shown in Fig. 1B0.51 ± 0.116.0 ± 0.8(8.5 ± 0.9) × 1041360 ± 80>0.06>160380 ± 60830 ± 70223tRNA3CyscStructures of the M. mazei isoacceptors tRNA1Cys, tRNA2Cys, and tRNA3Cys are shown in Fig. 1B0.58 ± 0.097.6 ± 0.3(8.0 ± 0.1) × 1041300 ± 80>0.03>140229 ± 21530 ± 40143tRNACysΔ1dThe A33U mutation in tRNA1Cys0.23 ± 0.0213.1 ± 2.8(1.6 ± 0.3) × 104840 ± 40>0.16>901700 ± 57720 ± 409.4tRNACysΔ2eThe U33A mutation in tRNA3Cys0.52 ± 0.1010.2 ± 1.2(5.1 ± 0.4) × 104990 ± 70>0.05>130409 ± 83580 ± 30125tRNACysΔ3fThe G57A mutation in tRNA3Cys0.30 ± 0.049.9 ± 0.7(3.0 ± 0.1) × 104660 ± 40>0.09>120752 ± 95600 ± 4039.5tRNACysΔ4gThe C20U/U21C/A44U/C46A/A47G mutations in tRNA3Cys0.25 ± 0.0310.1 ± 1.5(2.5 ± 0.3) × 104890 ± 50>0.14>1101250 ± 43480 ± 2020tRNACysΔ5hThe U49C/C51U mutations in tRNA3CysNDiND, not determinedNDND140 ± 20NDNDND125 ± 15NDtRNACysΔ6jThe C20U/U21C/A44U/C46A/A47G/G57A mutations in tRNA3Cys0.18 ± 0.028.6 ± 0.6(2.1 ± 0.3) × 104900 ± 30>0.18>901950 ± 44740 ± 5010.8a kcat/Km values were determined from initial velocities using the relation, ν = kcat/Km[E][S]b Specificity for each tRNA is determined as the ratio, kcat/Km(SEPRS)/kcat/Km(CYSRS)c Structures of the M. mazei isoacceptors tRNA1Cys, tRNA2Cys, and tRNA3Cys are shown in Fig. 1Bd The A33U mutation in tRNA1Cyse The U33A mutation in tRNA3Cysf The G57A mutation in tRNA3Cysg The C20U/U21C/A44U/C46A/A47G mutations in tRNA3Cysh The U49C/C51U mutations in tRNA3Cysi ND, not determinedj The C20U/U21C/A44U/C46A/A47G/G57A mutations in tRNA3Cys Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Alternative sulfur donors used by SepCysSConversion to Cys-tRNACys%HS–72.1 ± 9.5Thiophosphate52.3 ± 4.5Cysteine55.4 ± 5.0 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3tRNA discrimination by SepCysSPercentage conversion to Cys-tRNACysKdkcat/Kmakcat/Km values were determined from initial velocities using the relation ν = kcat/Km [E][S]%μmmin–1 μm–1Sep-tRNA1Cys52.2 ± 9.51.1 ± 0.20.009 ± 0.002Sep-tRNA2Cys75.3 ± 4.50.4 ± 0.150.014 ± 0.003Sep-tRNA3Cys72.2 ± 5.00.55 ± 0.180.012 ± 0.002tRNACysΔ272.0 ± 8.0NDbND, not determinedNDtRNACysΔ450.0 ± 6.0NDNDa kcat/Km values were determined from initial velocities using the relation ν = kcat/Km [E][S]b ND, not determined Open table in a new tab SepCysS Activity Assay—SepCysS was assayed anaerobically under an atmosphere of 95% N2, 5% H2/CO2 in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratories). All enzymes, buffers, and substrates entering the chamber were first deoxygenated by five cycles of vacuuming followed by purging with argon (19Sowers K.R. Sowers K.R. Schreier H.J. Archaea: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 38-39Google Scholar). Anoxic solutions were verified by testing larger volumes with a BBL anaerobic test strip. Anoxic solutions were kept in sealed glass vials and stored at -20 °C until needed.The Sep-tRNACys substrate needed for the assay of SepCysS was generated in one of two ways. A 2-fold excess of SepRS, usually 30–40 μm, was incubated with 10–20 μm tRNACys in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 3 mm phosphoserine, and 5 mm DTT for 8 min. 32P-labeled tRNA sample mixes were prepared as described above for aminoacylation assays. Aliquots were removed for evaluation of plateau aminoacylation levels. After phosphoserylation, the reactions were diluted 2-fold in water, and concentrated sodium acetate (pH 5.0) was then added to a final concentration of 200 mm to acidify the reaction and prevent tRNA deacylation. The reaction was then extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, and the phosphoserylated tRNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. tRNA was then resuspended in the anaerobic chamber in an anoxic solution consisting of 20 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.0), 5 mm MgCl2. Aminoacylation levels were requantified by removing a small aliquot and digesting with P1 nuclease followed by TLC separation as described above. The aminoacylated tRNA was then stored in a sealed glass vial at -20 °C until needed.Alternatively, Sep-tRNACys was generated in the same reaction as used for the SepCysS assay, by first performing the aminoacylation reaction with SepRS under anaerobic conditions. Excess SepCysS and sulfur donor are then added to initiate the SepCysS activity assay. In this approach, 20 μm 32P-labeled tRNACys was first heated to 85 °C and slowly cooled under anaerobic conditions in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2. Sep-tRNACys was then synthesized in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 3 mm phosphoserine, and 5 mm DTT. The phosphoserylation reaction was initiated by adding SepRS to 20–30 μm and incubating for 8 min at 37 °C. SepCysS was preincubated at 37 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm βME, 100 μm PLP, and 50% glycerol and was then added to concentrations of 0.05–40 μm, followed immediately by sodium sulfide to a concentration of 5 mm. Typical concentrations of Sep-tRNACys used in the second reaction, after dilution with reaction components, were 5–10 μm. In reactions where Sep-tRNACys was generated outside of the anaerobic chamber, it was first preincubated in the chamber at 37 °C with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT for several minutes before the addition of SepCysS and sodium sulfide. Anhydrous sodium sulfide was purchased from Aldrich (product 407410) and was opened and stored in an anaerobic environment. The pH of cysteine and sodium sulfide stock solutions was adjusted to neutrality.Sep-tRNACys, Cys-tRNACys, an intermediate-tRNACys (each as 3′-aminoacylated A76), and nonreacted substrate (as unmodified AMP) were separated by TLC on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates, which were run in 1 m acetic acid with adjustment of the pH to 3.5 using concentrated ammonium hydroxide. These conditions for TLC separation were reoptimized for visualization of the Cys-AMP product and differ from those employed to characterize SepRS reactions alone (13Hauenstein S. Hou Y.-M. Perona J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21997-22006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Quantitation was done by phosphorimaging analysis, as described previously (17Bullock T.L. Uter N. Nissan T.A. Perona J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Time courses from 0.5 to 60 min were fit to linear or sigmoidal equations. Results using either method of Sep-tRNACys preparation were identical.tRNA Binding to SepCysS—Equilibrium fluorescence titrations were performed at ambient temperature with 0.25 μm M. mazei SepCysS in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm βME. Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 295 nm, and the emission was monitored from 300 to 400 nm. An emission wavelength of 350 nm was used to quantitate binding after correction for dilution and for intrinsic quenching due to RNA absorbance at 295 nm, according to the formula, Fc = Fobs × antilog((A295 + A350)/2) (20Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 53-55Google Scholar). Control solutions of bovine serum albumin or of tryptophan showed no fluorescence response to tRNA. tRNA was titrated in the concentration range of 0.05–10 μm. The Kd values were derived by fitting the data to a quadratic binding equation using Scientist software.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDifferential Utilization of tRNACys Isoacceptors by SepRS and CysRS—We chose to study Cys-tRNACys formation in M. mazei because genetic techniques have been developed in this organism (21Ehlers C. Weidenbach K. Deppenmeier U. Metcalf W.W. Schmitz R.A. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2005; 273: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and because its biosynthetic apparatus is expanded to its known limit in M. mazei and M. barkeri, suggesting the possibility that the macromolecules involved may be regulated in unusual ways or may perform physiological roles unrelated to protein synthesis. Both of these Methanosarcina possess all three enzymes corresponding to the two distinct pathways, CysRS, SepRS, and SepCysS, as well as three tRNACys isoacceptors (Fig. 1). In contrast, M. acetivorans, the other Methanosarcina for which the genome sequence is available, possesses all three enzymes but only one tRNACys acceptor that reads both the UGU and UGC codons. A"
https://openalex.org/W1969211306,"Synthesis of cysteinyl-tRNA(Cys) in methanogenic archaea proceeds by a two-step pathway in which tRNA(Cys) is first aminoacylated with phosphoserine by phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase (SepRS). Characterization of SepRS from the mesophile Methanosarcina mazei by gel filtration and nondenaturing mass spectrometry shows that the native enzyme exists as an alpha4 tetramer when expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli. However, active site titrations monitored by ATP/PP(i) burst kinetics, together with analysis of tRNA binding stoichiometry by fluorescence spectroscopy, show that the tetrameric enzyme binds two tRNAs and that only two of the four chemically equivalent subunits catalyze formation of phosphoseryl adenylate. Therefore, the phenomenon of half-of-the-sites activity, previously described for synthesis of 1 mol of tyrosyl adenylate by the dimeric class I tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, operates as well in this homotetrameric class II tRNA synthetase. Analysis of cognate and noncognate reactions by ATP/PP(i) and aminoacylation kinetics strongly suggests that SepRS is able to discriminate against the noncognate amino acids glutamate, serine, and phosphothreonine without the need for a separate hydrolytic editing site. tRNA(Cys) binding to SepRS also enhances the capacity of the enzyme to discriminate among amino acids, indicating the existence of functional connectivity between the tRNA and amino acid binding sites of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2007903275,"The functional diversity of large conductance Ca(2+)- and voltage-dependent K(+) (BK) channels arises mainly from co-assembly of the pore-forming mSlo alpha subunits with four tissue-enriched auxiliary beta subunits. The structural basis of the interaction between alpha subunits with beta subunits is not well understood. Using computational and experimental methods, we demonstrated that four mSlo turrets decentralized distally from the channel pore to provide a wide open conformation and that the mSlo and hbeta4 subunits together formed a ""helmet"" containing three basic residues (Lys-120, Arg-121, and Lys-125), which impeded the entry of charybdotoxin (ChTX) by both the electrostatic interaction and limited space. In addition, the tyrosine insert mutant (in100Y) showed 56% inhibition, with a K(d) = 17 nm, suggesting that the hbeta4 lacks an external ChTX-binding site (Tyr-100). We also found that mSlo had an internal binding site (Tyr-294) in the alpha subunits that could ""permanently"" block 15% of mSlo+hbeta4 currents in the presence of 100 nm ChTX. These findings provide a better understanding of the diverse interactions between alpha and beta subunits and will improve the design of channel inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2079671002,"Cell migration is central to a number of normal and disease processes. Small organic molecules that inhibit cell migration have potential as both research probes and therapeutic agents. We have identified two tetrahydroisoquinoline natural product analogs with antimigratory activities on Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells: a semisynthetic derivative of quinocarmycin (also known as quinocarcin), DX-52-1, and a more complex synthetic molecule, HUK-921, related to the naphthyridinomycin family. It has been assumed that the cellular effects of reactive tetrahydroisoquinolines result from the alkylation of DNA. We have reported previously that the primary target of DX-52-1 relevant to cell migration appears to be the membrane-cytoskeleton linker protein radixin. Here we extend the analysis of the protein targets of DX-52-1, reporting that the multifunctional carbohydrate-binding protein galectin-3 is a secondary target of DX-52-1 that may also be relevant to the antimigratory effects of both DX-52-1 and HUK-921. All known inhibitors of galectin-3 target its beta-galactoside-binding site in the carbohydrate recognition domain. However, we found that DX-52-1 and HUK-921 bind galectin-3 outside of its beta-galactoside-binding site. Intriguingly HUK-921, although a less potent inhibitor of cell migration than DX-52-1, had far greater selectivity for galectin-3 over radixin, exhibiting little binding to radixin, both in vitro and in cells. Overexpression of galectin-3 in cells led to a dramatic increase in cell adhesion on different extracellular matrix substrata as well as changes in cell-cell adhesion and cell motility. Galectin-3-overexpressing cells had greatly reduced sensitivity to DX-52-1 and HUK-921, and these compounds caused a change in localization of the overexpressed galectin-3 and reversion of the cells to a more normal morphology. The converse manipulation, RNA interference-based silencing of galectin-3 expression, resulted in reduced cell-matrix adhesion and cell migration. In aggregate, the data suggest that DX-52-1 and HUK-921 inhibit a carbohydrate binding-independent function of galectin-3 that is involved in cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2018263982,"CRM (chloroplast RNA splicing and ribosome maturation) is a recently recognized RNA-binding domain of ancient origin that has been retained in eukaryotic genomes only within the plant lineage. Whereas in bacteria CRM domains exist as single domain proteins involved in ribosome maturation, in plants they are found in a family of proteins that contain between one and four repeats. Several members of this family with multiple CRM domains have been shown to be required for the splicing of specific plastidic group II introns. Detailed biochemical analysis of one of these factors in maize, CRS1, demonstrated its high affinity and specific binding to the single group II intron whose splicing it facilitates, the plastid-encoded atpF intron RNA. Through its association with two intronic regions, CRS1 guides the folding of atpF intron RNA into its predicted “catalytically active” form. To understand how multiple CRM domains cooperate to achieve high affinity sequence-specific binding to RNA, we analyzed the RNA binding affinity and specificity associated with each individual CRM domain in CRS1; whereas CRM3 bound tightly to the RNA, CRM1 associated specifically with a unique region found within atpF intron domain I. CRM2, which demonstrated only low binding affinity, also seems to form specific interactions with regions localized to domains I, III, and IV.

Iyer L. Anantharaman V. Gen. Biol. 2003; 4: R64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, CRM domains are encoded by a single stand alone open reading frame; YhbY, the Escherichia coli member of this family, binds precursors to 50 S ribosomal subunits and is likely to be required for their maturation (4Barkan A.

CAF1 and CAF2 contain two CRM domains each and function in complexes with the peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase homolog (CRS2) to promote the splicing of nine group-IIB introns (2Ostheimer G.J. Williams-Carrier R. Belcher S. Osborne E. Gierke J. Barkan A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 11Jenkins B.D. Kulhanek D.J. Barkan A.

CRS1 has three CRM domains (see Fig. 1) and is required specifically for the splicing of a single subgroup IIA intron, the atpF intron RNA (1Till B. Schmitz-Linneweber C. Williams-Carrier R. Barkan A. RNA. 2001; 7: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Jenkins B.D. Kulhanek D.J. Barkan A.

Through its tight and specific association with two intronic regions within domains I and IV, CRS1 either stabilizes or induces the folding of atpF intron RNA, into its postulated “catalytically active” form (12Ostersetzer O. Cooke A.M. Watkins K.P. Barkan A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). CFM2, which is closely related to CRS1, harbors four CRM domains and is involved in the splicing of both group I and group II introns in maize and Arabidopsis chloroplasts (13Asakura Y. Barkan A. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 3864-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that an individual CRM domain from CRS1 and E. coli YhbY protein are able to associate with RNA (4Barkan A. Klipcan L. Ostersetzer O. Kawamura T. Asakura Y. Watkins K.P. RNA. 2007; 13: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, the RNA binding specificities and functions in intron folding and/or splicing of CRS1, CAF1, CAF2, and CFM2 are likely to be mediated by their CRM domains.

CRS2-associated factor chloroplast RNA splicing CRM family member glutathione S-transferase RNA recognition motif nucleotide(s) dithiothreitol Tris borate-EDTA. To address this possibility, we characterized the RNA binding activities associated with each individual CRM domain in CRS1. Although CRM3 demonstrated high affinity binding to RNA but lacked sequence specificity, CRM1 formed specific interactions with a unique region within domains I, the 111-nt sequence, of the atpF intron ligand of the intact CRS1 protein. CRM2, which demonstrated low binding affinity (in the mm range), also seems to form specific interactions with regions localized to domains I, III, and IV. In silico and biochemical analyses of CRS1 CRM domain RNA binding activities also revealed structural similarity to the RNA recognition motif (RRM) and suggest a common mechanism of RNA recognition by these two evolutionarily distinct RNA-binding domains.

The different oligonucleotides used to generate these constructs are summarized in supplemental Table S1. Mutations in CRS1 CRM domains were introduced by a QuikChange ® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with Pyrobest DNA-polymerase enzyme (Takara), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, mutations were also generated by extension PCRs; the upstream mutated strand was generated with forward wild-type primer and a reverse primer encoding the mutated residues; the overlapping downstream fragment was generated with a forward mutated primer and a reverse wild-type oligonucleotide. The “complete” mutated DNA fragment was generated by a third PCR, using these two partially overlapping PCR products as templates to each other, together with the wild-type forward and reverse primers of the domain. The wild-type and mutant domains PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into the same sites in pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences), in such a way that the each sequence encoding the domains was fused in-frame to GST. Similarly, CRM3 βαββ core was subcloned into pGEX-4T1 with SalI and NotI sites, in-frame to GST. The resulting recombinant GST-CRM fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli XL1-Blue strain (Stratagene), grown in 1 liter of LB medium at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.8, and induced with 1.0 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h at 22 °C (or with 1.0 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C, in the case of CRM3 βαββ core). The cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 40 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed twice in a French press manifold (Thermo). Nonsoluble materials were removed by 15 min of centrifugation at 12,000 × g (4 °C). The clear lysate was applied to 1 ml of glutathione beads (GE Healthcare); the bound protein was washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and once with high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 750 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 8.0) to minimize nucleic acid contamination and protein aggregation. The salt was removed by phosphate-buffered saline wash, and the tagged protein was eluted (as attempts to release the CRM proteins from the GST tag resulted in the proteins aggregating on the beads) with 20 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) in a minimal volume (0.5-2 ml) of buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, dialyzed against 50% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, 500 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0, aliquoted into 100-μl fractions, and stored at -20 °C until use. Under these conditions, the proteins retained their full activity for a few days, during which the binding experiments were performed. SDS-PAGE analyses of the purified GST-CRM proteins were in good agreement with expected sizes and confirmed that the purity of the eluted protein was higher than 95% (data not shown). Mutated CRM1, CRM2, and CRM3 domains were purified as described above, generally resulting in similar protein yields. In Vitro Transcription of RNA Templates and RNA Binding Assays—RNAs used for binding studies are outlined in supplemental Table S1. atpF intron was generated by PCR with genomic maize DNA, whereas the psaI mRNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR with maize chloroplast RNA. The mutated DNA fragment of atpF domain I 111-nt region was generated by PCRs with two complementary DNA oligonucleotides overlapping the entire 111-nt sequence, containing the consensus T7 promoter site upstream to the 111-nt RNA sequence. In vitro transcription of “body-labeled” RNAs was carried out with T7-RNA polymerase (Promega), with 0.5 mm each of ATP, GTP, and CTP and 0.05 mm UTP in the presence of 20 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol). The in vitro transcribed RNAs were treated with RQ1 DNase (RNase-free) (Promega) to remove contaminating DNAs, purified by a RNeasy ® kit (Qiagen), and stored in 50 μl of double distilled H2O at -20 °C for several days till their use in the RNA binding experiments. Filter binding assays were performed essentially as described by Ostersetzer et al. (12Ostersetzer O. Cooke A.M. Watkins K.P. Barkan A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Before their use in the binding assay, the in vitro transcribed RNAs were renatured by heating to 95 °C for 2 min, in a small volume of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA buffer, after which the RNAs were transferred to ice. The RNAs were allowed to refold in the presence of KCl (0.15 m) and MgCl2 (to 10 mm) at 37 °C for 5 min and were then transferred to ice until their use in the binding assays. Binding reactions (20 μl) contained 25 pm labeled RNA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 unit/μl RNase inhibitor (Fermentas or Promega). Protein was added to the “renatured RNA” and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. Following the binding, the reactions were chilled on ice and immediately passed through a sandwich of nitrocellulose (Protran, 0.2 μm; Schleicher & Schuell) and charged nylon membranes (Nytran SuperCharge nylon; Schleicher & Schuell) by vacuum filtration, using a slot-blot manifold (Hybrislot; Invitrogen). The membranes were washed twice with 200 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm KOAc, 5 mm MgCl2 buffer, dried for 5 min at room temperature, and exposed to PhosphorImager screen (Fuji). The data were quantified by ImageQuant software (Version 5.1; Molecular Dynamics), and the fraction of bound RNA was calculated as the ratio between RNA captured by the nitrocellulose and total RNA signal by both membranes. RNA Mobility Shift Assay—For gel retardation assays, binding reactions were performed by incubating increasing amount of purified GST-CRM1 (1-1,000 nm) with 25 pm 32P-labeled 111-nt RNA, in 10 μl of reaction volume containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 4% glycerol, 66 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT for 15 min at room temperature. Supershifts were induced by anti-GST monoclonal antibodies (Santa-Cruz Biotech), which were added to the binding reaction mix and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The binding reactions were transferred to ice and loaded onto native pre-electrophoresed 5% polyacrylamide gel (37.5: 1 acrylamide: bis) and electrophoresed at 4 °C, in 0.25× TBE, containing 2.5% glycerol. The gels were dried, and the RNA bands were visualized by PhosphorImager (Fuji). Hydroxyl Radical RNA Footprinting—RNA footprinting analysis was performed as described by us previously (12Ostersetzer O. Cooke A.M. Watkins K.P. Barkan A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Prior to each assay, a nonradioactive T7-transcribed 111-nt region RNA was purified and extracted using the RNeasy ® kit and folded as above. Binding reactions (50 μl) were performed by incubating 10 nm “refolded” 111-nt RNA template with 500 nm purified GST-CRM1 protein, in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.0, 150 mm KOAc (in the absence of DTT or β-mercaptoethanol) at specified concentrations of MgCl2, at 25 °C for 10 min. Hydroxyl radical cleavage was induced as described previously (12Ostersetzer O. Cooke A.M. Watkins K.P. Barkan A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cleavage sites were visualized by primer extension with Omniscript-reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) with 5′-32P-labeled reverse 111-nt primer (supplemental Table S2). Sequencing ladder was generated with untreated RNA by primer extension reactions with ddNTPs (ddATP and ddTTP at 0.15 mm, and ddCTP and ddGTP at 0.1 mm concentrations). Molecular weight standard was generated by 5′-32P-labeling of a DNA mass ladder (Fermentas). Primer extension reactions were stopped by the addition of two volumes of 90% (v/v) formamide in 0.5× TBE, boiled for 3 min, and resolved (5-10 μl) by electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels (under 15 Watts for ∼2 h). After electrophoresis the gels were dried and imaged with a PhosphorImager (Fuji). RNA Structure Probing—The secondary structure of the maize atpF intron RNA 111-nt region was analyzed by an enzymatic method, generally as described by Warf and Berglund (15Warf M.B. Berglund J.A. RNA. 2007; 13: 2238-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The in vitro transcribed 111-nt RNA was purified by a RNeasy ® kit (Qiagen) and folded by denaturation and renaturation procedure, as described above. Limited RNA hydrolysis was initiated by mixing 0.7 μg of the in vitro transcribed 111-nt RNA fragment with ribonuclease V1 (0.01, 0.1, and 0.2 unit), ribonuclease T1 (1, 10, and 100 units), or mung bean nuclease (1, 8.5, and 85 units), in the appropriate digestion enzyme buffer, for 2 min at room temperature (22-25 °C). The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of stop solution buffer, containing 7.5 m urea, 20 mm EDTA, followed by phenol extraction and EtOH precipitation. For primer extensions, a reverse 111-nt primer (5′-GGGGATTTGTGTTTGCTC-3′), labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, was combined with the 111-nt fragment RNA. The products of the RNA cleavage and primer extension were loaded onto 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea in 1× TBE, along with sequencing ladder obtained by primer extensions with ddNTPs (see above) and a 5′-labeled DNA ladder. Following electrophoresis (under 15 Watts for ∼2 h), the gels were dried and imaged with a PhosphorImager. In Silico Analyses—Multiple alignments of sequences were performed with ClustalX (16Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2360) Google Scholar) and T-coffee programs (17Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5337) Google Scholar). MEGA program (version 3) and ClustalX were used for the construction of phylogenetic trees (18Kumar S. Tamura K. Nei M. Brief Bioinform. 2004; 5: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10625) Google Scholar). Predicted three-dimensional structures of individual CRM domains were constructed by homology modeling, using the SwissModel server (19Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar) and established bacterial CRM structures (5Liu D. Wyss D.F. J. Biomol.

Biol. 2005; 346: 1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was used to extrapolate multiple sequence alignment on the three-dimensional structure of the proteins, thereby allowing us to predict, map, and highlight selected residues on the predicted three-dimensional structure. The visualization and manipulation of obtained models were arranged by the PyMol package. RNA-binding sites on each protein were predicted using the RNABindR server (21Terribilini M. Lee J.-H. Yan C. Jernigan R.L. Honavar V. Dobbs D. RNA. 2006; 12: 1450-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); alternatively, proposed RNA-binding sites of C-terminal domain of the translation-initiation factor-3 protein were mapped on corresponding CRM regions. Predicted RNA secondary structures were analyzed by the RNA Alifold (22Hofacker I.L. Fekete M. Stadler P.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) prediction server using multiple sequence alignments with ClustalX of orthologous atpF 111-nt sequences, obtained from various plants; the secondary structure was plotted with Mfold software (23Zuker M.

Individual CRM Domains from CRS1 Bind with Different Affinities and Specificities to Different Fragments of the atpF Intron—Individual CRS1-CRM domains were expressed and purified as recombinant proteins fused to GST, and each protein was assayed for its binding to atpF intron RNA in vitro. By fitting the binding data with the Hill model (Origin 7.5 software; Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA), the calculated dissociation constant value (KD) for CRS1-CRM1 domain binding to atpF intron RNA was 65 ± 15 nm, with an apparent Hill coefficient (nH) of 0.82 ± 0.11 (Fig. 1), suggesting non-cooperative binding activity. Under these conditions, GST alone demonstrated no activity (Fig. 1). GST-CRM3 demonstrated the highest affinity, with a calculated dissociation constant of 27 ± 7 nm and an apparent Hill coefficient of 0.93 ± 0.14 (Fig. 1), whereas GST-CRM2 demonstrated only low binding activity, with a calculated dissociation constant of 0.32 ± 0.10 mm, ∼10,000-fold higher than the KD values of CRM1 or CRM3, and a calculated Hill coefficient value of ∼0.4 (Fig. 1), suggesting negative binding cooperativity. We also assayed the binding specificities associated with each of the CRM domains of CRS1 to different fragments of atpF intron RNA (Fig. 2A); these included a unique 111-nt sequence found within atpF domain I (the 111-nt region) and domain IV, two previously identified CRS1-binding sites (12Ostersetzer O. Cooke A.M. Watkins K.P. Barkan A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and several other fragments that are not recognized by the intact CRS1 protein, including atpF domains II, III, and V-VI and the plastid psaI mRNA (12Ostersetzer O. Cooke A.M. Watkins K.P. Barkan A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). GST-CRM3 bound with similarly high affinity to all of these RNAs (affinities ranging between 50 and 80 nm; Fig. 2B). However, GST-CRM1 demonstrated specificity in its binding only to the 111-nt region in domain I (Fig. 2B). Although GST-CRM1 KD value to the 111-nt fragment was ∼80 nm (Fig. 2B), which is similar to the binding affinity of CRM1 to atpF intron RNA (∼65 nm), its calculated dissociation constants to other RNA fragments corresponding to atpF domains II-III, IV, and V-VI or to psaI mRNA were significantly lower (ranging between 200 and 300 nm) (Fig. 2B). Its specific association with the 111-nt region was also demonstrated in gel mobility shift assays (Fig. 2C). Although the resolution of this assay was limited, a single band corresponding to GST-CRM1/111-nt RNA ribonucleoprotein complex was formed (Fig. 2C). Moreover, in the supershift assay, the addition of anti-GST antibodies decreased the mobility of the ribonucleoprotein GST-CRM1/111-nt RNA complex (Fig. 2C, lanes 9-13), further supporting the specific association of CRM1 to the 111-nt sequence. In contrast to CRM1 and CRM3, GST-CRM2 demonstrated only low affinity to atpF intron, with a calculated dissociation constant value in the low millimolar range (Fig. 1), GST-CRM2 was found to be unstable, because under high concentrations the protein tended to aggregate upon its elution from the glutathione beads. Although we were unable to make any firm conclusions about its RNA-binding sequence specificity, results from RNA binding assays suggested that CRM2 form specific interactions with several regions localized to atpF intron fragments corresponding to domains I, III, and IV (data not shown). CRM1 Associates Specifically with Short Single-stranded Sequences within the 111-nt RNA—To identify regions in the 111-nt region that are directly bound by CRM1, we performed hydroxyl radical footprinting with GST-CRM1 and the 111-n"

Mn-SOD expression is tightly regulated in a manner that synchronizes its cytoprotective functions during inflammatory challenges. Induction of Mn-SOD gene expression by the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β is mediated through a complex intronic enhancer element. To identify and characterize the transcription factors required for Mn-SOD enhancer function, a yeast one-hybrid assay was utilized, and two CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) members, C/EBP β and C/EBP δ, were identified. These two transcription factors responded to IL-1β treatment with distinct expression profiles, different temporal yet inducible interactions with the endogenous Mn-SOD enhancer, and also opposite effects on Mn-SOD transcription. C/EBP β is expressed as three isoforms, LAP* (liver-activating protein), LAP, and LIP (liver-inhibitory protein). Our functional analysis demonstrated that only the full-length C/EBP β/LAP* served as a true activator for Mn-SOD, whereas LAP, LIP, and C/EBP δ functioned as potential repressors. Finally, our systematic mutagenesis of the unique N-terminal 21 amino acids further solidified the importance of LAP* in the induction of Mn-SOD and emphasized the crucial role of this isoform. Our data demonstrating the physiological relevance of the N-terminal peptide also provide a rationale for revisiting the role of LAP* in the regulation of other genes and in pathways such as lipogenesis and development.

Physiol. 1994; 266: L664-L671PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the stimulus-dependent elevation in Mn-SOD mRNA level is because of increased de novo transcription and that maximum induction of the gene requires an enhancer region, located in intron 2 in both rodent and human Mn-SOD genes (17Rogers R.J.

This enhancer is highly conserved over a 200–500-bp region, depending on the species, even though it resides in an intron in all the species studied. Sequence analysis, together with electrophoretic mobility shift assay, has indicated the potential involvement of various transcription factors with the intronic enhancer during the stimulus-dependent up-regulation of Mn-SOD transcription (19Jones P.L.

By employing a yeast one-hybrid strategy to identify cognate regulatory factors that bind to conserved enhancer sequences, we have identified CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) β and δ as candidate factors involved in Mn-SOD gene induction. The C/EBPs are a subfamily of the larger basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor family (23Takiguchi M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To date six C/EBP family members, C/EBP α, β, γ, δ, ϵ, and ζ, have been identified and cloned. C/EBP α, β, γ, and δ genes contain no intron, whereas C/EBP ϵ and ζ contain two and four exons, respectively (reviewed in Refs. 24Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem.

All of the six members share noteworthy sequence identity in the C-terminal bZIP domain. All members are able to form homodimers as well as heterodimers in all intrafamilial combinations (24Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schrem H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), where R isAorG, and Y is C or T. In addition, members of the C/EBP family can form heterodimers with other bZIP subfamily members, such as CREB/ATF and AP-1, with alterations in the DNA binding sequence (28Vallejo M. Ron D.

Different C/EBP members function specifically through collaboration, but some level of redundancy is also believed to exist (reviewed in Ref. 33Nerlov C. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 318-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The C/EBPs perform critical roles in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes, such as cell differentiation, metabolic regulation, cell proliferation, and inflammation (24Ramji D.P.

Savoldi G. Ferrari F. Garnier M. Ghezzi P. Albertini A. Di Lorenzo D. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 36Fukuoka T. Kitami Y. Okura T. Hiwada K. J. Biol.

Glia. 2000; 29: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). C/EBP β mRNA is intron-less and gives rise to three different protein isoforms through the alternative use of three inherent translation start codons (38Ossipow V. Descombes P. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8219-8223Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). These isoforms include full-length LAP* (liver-activating protein), medium-length LAP, and short-form LIP (liver-inhibitory protein). Both LAP* and LAP are usually considered to be transcriptional activators, whereas LIP is usually considered a dominant negative isoform, as it lacks all activation domains. Since the identification of the isoforms by Dr. Ueli Schibler's group (38Ossipow V. Descombes P. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8219-8223Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 39Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), the functional relevance of the unique N-terminal amino acids in full-length LAP* has been addressed only in a limited number of studies. For example, Kowenz-Leutz and Leutz (40Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) reported that the first ∼20 amino acids are essential for recruiting the SWI/SNF complex in chicken cells. Su et al. (41Su W.C. Chou H.Y. Chang C.J. Lee Y.M. Chen W.H. Huang K.H. Lee M.Y. Lee S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51150-51158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) proposed that LAP* forms unique internal disulfide bonds that differ from LAP because of the single cysteine residue in the first 21 amino acid, and another group has proposed that the different states of sumoylation of LAP* versus LAP caused the distinct functions of these two isoforms (42Eaton E.M. Sealy L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33416-33421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, there is evidence that LAP*, but not LAP, can bind to Homer-3, a member of the Homer family of postsynaptic density scaffolding proteins found in excitatory neuronal synapses, which can also regulate the transcriptional activation of LAP* (43Ishiguro K. Xavier R. Blood. 2004; 103: 2248-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The results of the present study have demonstrated that the knockdown of C/EBP β by siRNA or its absence in C/EBP β–/– mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells leads to the inhibition of IL-1β-dependent induction of Mn-SOD gene expression. We have also shown that the different isoforms of C/EBP β as well as C/EBP δ have unique and specific functions related to Mn-SOD gene expression. Full-length LAP* serves the role of a transcriptional activator, whereas medium-length LAP, LIP, and C/EBP δ are able to efficiently block IL-1β-dependent induction. We also confirmed the specific in vivo binding of LAP* and C/EBP δ to the Mn-SOD enhancer. Most importantly, we have systematically demonstrated the importance of specific N-terminal amino acids unique to LAP*, solidifying the importance of this domain and LAP* in the transcriptional activation of Mn-SOD by IL-1β. Overall, our data also strongly suggest that the full-length C/EBP β/LAP* may have a much more important physiological role than previously realized. Reagents and Antibodies—Normal rabbit and mouse IgG (sc-2027, sc-2025), antibodies against the C/EBP β C terminus (sc-150, recognize LAP*, LAP, and LIP), C/EBP δ (sc-151), HA tag (sc-7392), and TFIIB (sc-225) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The LAP* antibody (ab18327), specific to the first 21 amino acids, was purchased from Abcam Inc. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, protein G-Sepharose, an ECL kit, and secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare. Yeast One-hybrid Screening—The top and bottom strands of the Mn-SOD intronic enhancer sequence (5′-GTAGGGGAAAAGCCCAGTTGGGAAATCGTTT-3′) were synthesized by Invitrogen as three tandem repeats with either EcoRI/SalI or EcoRI/XbaI restriction sites on each end. The oligonucleotides were annealed and then phosphorylated at the 5′-ends by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). After purification, the double-stranded EcoRI/XbaI oligos were ligated into the pHISi vector, and the EcoRI/SalI oligos were ligated into the pLacZi vector obtained from Clontech. Ligation products were transformed, and positive clones were verified by sequencing. Each clone was linearized with either Xho (pHISi) or NcoI (pLacZi) and used for transformation/integration into the yeast YM4271 strain. Integration was confirmed through plating on auxotrophic media, and subsequent transformation of the library was confirmed similarly with drop-out media, and increasing concentrations of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. One-hybrid screening was done using the manufacturer's recommendations for the MATCHMAKER protocol (Clontech). 5 × 105 colony-forming units were screened from a rat lung cDNA library obtained from Clontech. Positive clones were identified by sequencing. Cell Culture—L2 cells, a rat pulmonary epithelial-like cell line (ATCC CCL 149), and MEFs, both wild type and C/EBP β-deficient, were provided by Dr. P. Johnson (National Institutes of Health) via Dr. M. Kilberg (University of Florida). L2 and MEFs were grown in Ham's modified F12K medium (Sigma) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), respectively, with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), ABAM (penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), amphotericin B (0.25 μg/ml); Invitrogen), and 4 mm glutamine at 37 °C in incubators supplied with 5% CO2. 2 ng/ml IL-1β (R&D Systems) was used to treat cells for the indicated times. Recombinant Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Coding sequences for each of the C/EBP β isoforms were cloned into pcDNA3.1 using the EcoRV and HindIII sites. The C/EBP δ cDNA was originally obtained from a yeast one-hybrid library screening of the Clontech rat lung cDNA library and subcloned from the pACT2 vector (Clontech) into the HindIII and XbalI sites of pcDNA3.1. Mutagenesis was performed with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). An HA tag was subcloned into the pLAP* C terminus by a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit using primers 5′-CTCGGCGGGTCACTGCTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTTAGAAGCTTAAGTTTAAACCGC-3 and 5′-GCGGTTTAAACTTAAGCTTCTAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAGCAGTGACCCGCCGAG-3′. The reporter construct (Mn-SOD promoter/enhancer-human growth hormone (hGH)) (17Rogers R.J. Chesrown S.E. Kuo S. Monnier J.M. Nick H.S. Biochem.

Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation, Northern Analysis, and Statistical Analysis—Total RNA was isolated by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (45Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63183) Google Scholar) with modifications (10Visner G.A. Dougall W.C. Wilson J.M. Burr I.A. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2856-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or with the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen). 15 μg of total RNA was size-fractionated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and electrotransferred to a charged nylon membrane (Zetabind, Cuno Inc., Meriden, CT) followed by UV cross-linking. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 61 °C with a 32P radiolabeled gene-specific probe generated by random primer extension, washed with a high stringency buffer at 66 °C, and then analyzed by autoradiography. Densitometry was performed by direct scanning of the original autoradiograph and analyzed using Scion Image analysis from the National Institutes of Health. Statistical analysis was derived from a minimum of three independent experiments. The errors are presented as the standard error of the means, and comparisons were performed using Student's t test. First-strand DNA Synthesis and Real-time PCR—1 μg of total RNA isolated with the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen) was used to generate first-strand DNA for real-time PCR analysis using the SuperScript™ first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The final product was diluted to 100 μl, and 2 μl was used as the template for each real-time PCR. To this, each primer at 0.3 μm, 12.5 μl of iTaq™ SYBR® Green Supermix with ROX (Bio-Rad) and water were added to a final volume of 25 μl. The primers used for amplification to measure Mn-SOD mRNA levels were: sense, 5′-CCGCCTGCTCTAATCAGGA-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCCAAATGGCTTTCAGATAGTCA-3′. The ABI 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used with the following parameters: cycle 1, 95 °C for 10 min; cycle 2, 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min, for 40 cycles. After PCR, melting curves were acquired by a stepwise increase of the temperature from 55 to 95 °C to ensure that a single product was amplified in the reaction. The cyclophilin A mRNA level was also measured at the same time as the internal control. The primers for amplification were: sense, 5′-GGTGGCAAGTCCATCTACGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCACCTTCCCAAAGACCACAT-3′. Real-time PCR was done in triplicate with samples from at least three independent experiments. The errors are presented as the standard error of the means, and comparisons were performed using Student's t test. Transient Transfection—L2 cells were cultured as described previously and transfected at ∼60% confluency in 10 cm dishes. Transfection was done using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). For protein overexpression analysis, 5 μg of the indicated plasmid was transfected, and total cell extract was collected 48 h after transfection and subjected to immunoblot analysis. For reporter assay analysis, 0.2 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of the indicated transcription factor constructs were used, and empty vector pcDNA 3.1 was used to bring the total DNA amount to 4 μg. After 24 h, the cells were split 1:2 and incubated for another 16 h. IL-1β (R&D Systems) was added to one set of plates to a final concentration of 2 ng/ml. After 8 h, total RNA was isolated for Northern analysis. Immunoprecipitation—Total cell extracts were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (150 nm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tri-HCl, pH 7.5) at the time points indicated and incubated at 4 °C overnight with antibody against C/EBP β. Complex capture was completed by incubating with protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. Complexes were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer followed by immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibody. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoprecipitates, 10 μg of total cell lysate, or 40 μg of nuclear extracts prepared at the indicated time points were separated on a 10.5–14% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and then electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were then blocked for 1 h with 8% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 200 mm NaCl) at room temperature. The membranes were incubated at 4 °C with primary antibody overnight, washed three times with TBST, incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h, washed again three times, and subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was performed according to a modified protocol from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Charlottesville, VA) as described. Protein-DNA cross-linking was performed at the indicated time points by adding formaldehyde directly to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1% and then stopped 10 min later by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cross-linked chromatin was sonicated with a Branson model 500 ultrasonic dismembrator (Fisher Scientific). Cell extract was incubated with 2 μg of the indicated antibodies overnight, and a normal rabbit or mouse IgG was used as the nonspecific antibody control. The antibody-bound complex was precipitated by protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA fragments in the immunoprecipitated complex were released by reversing the cross-linking at 65 °C for 5 h and purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Real-time PCR analysis was performed to determine the ratio of precipitated DNA to the input controls. Serial dilutions of input chromatin were used to generate a standard curve for determining the relative amount of product. Forward primer 5′-CTGAGGGTGGAGCATAGCCA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCGCTGCTCTCCTCAGAACA-3′ were used to amplify the promoter region, –249 to +66; forward primer 5′-AAGTGTGGTATTTTAGCATAGTTGTGTA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AGAGGAAAGTTGTCAGATGTCACC-3′ were used to amplify the intronic Mn-SOD enhancer region, +1716 to +1940; forward primer 5′-GCAGGCTCCCAATCAATACAT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGGAATAGCAGGCAGCGTG-3′ were used to amplify an intergenic region as negative controls. Data were plotted as the fraction of immunoprecipitate to the total input DNA sample.

https://openalex.org/W2090408147,"Finding rapid, reversible down-regulation of human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) in LS180 cells following curcumin treatment led to the discovery that UGTs require phosphorylation. UGTs, distributed primarily in liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, inactivate aromatic-like metabolites and a vast number of dietary and environmental chemicals, which reduces the risk of toxicities, mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis. Our aim here is to determine relevant kinases and mechanism(s) regulating phosphorylation of constitutive UGTs in LS180 cells and 10 different human UGT cDNA-transfected COS-1 systems. Time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of immunodetectable [33P]orthophosphate in UGTs and protein kinase Cϵ (PKCϵ), following treatment of LS180 cells with curcumin or the PKC inhibitor calphostin-C, suggested UGT phosphorylation is supported by active PKC(s). Immunofluorescent and co-immunoprecipitation studies with UGT-transfected cells showed co-localization of UGT1A7His and PKCϵ and of UGT1A10His and PKCα or PKCδ. Inhibition of UGT activity by PKCϵ-specific antagonist peptide or by PKCϵ-targeted destruction with PKCϵ-specific small interference RNA and activation of curcumin-down-regulated UGTs with typical PKC agonists verified a central PKC role in glucuronidation. Moreover, in vitro phosphorylation of nascent UGT1A7His by PKCϵ confirms it is a bona fide PKC substrate. Finally, catalase or herbimycin-A inhibition of constitutive or hydrogen peroxide-activated-UGTs demonstrated that reactive oxygen species-related oxidants act as second messengers in maintaining constitutive PKC-dependent signaling evidently sustaining UGT phosphorylation and activity. Because cells use signal transduction collectively to detect and respond appropriately to environmental changes, this report, combined with our earlier demonstration that specific phospho-groups in UGT1A7 determined substrate selections, suggests regulated phosphorylation allows adaptations regarding differential phosphate utilization by UGTs to function efficiently.

UGT isozymes inactivate a vast number of structurally diverse chemicals by attaching glucuronic acid to generate water-soluble products with high excretability. Because lipid solubility of chemicals taken into the body largely determines membrane permeability governing their absorption, distribution, and excretion, glucuronidation is the primary cellular process that protects against such chemicals (1Dutton G.J. Dutton G.J. Glucuronidation of Drugs and Other Compounds. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1980: 69-78Google Scholar). Chemicals are encountered on a regular basis due to their ubiquitous presence in dietary plants, pyrolysates of wood and petroleum products, distributions related to consumer and agricultural activities, and therapeutic agents. Critical endogenous substrates include bilirubin, steroids and their metabolites, bile acids, retinoic acids, thyroid hormones, and others (1Dutton G.J. Dutton G.J. Glucuronidation of Drugs and Other Compounds. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1980: 69-78Google Scholar). In the case of defective UGT–/–, lipophiles accumulate in tissues leading to deleterious effects.

To a detriment, glucuronidation converts medicinal chemicals, which lead to premature termination of therapeutic activity.

Growth and Transfection of Cells—LS180 colon and COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10 and 4% fetal calf serum, respectively, and exposed to reagents solubilized in fresh Me2SO diluted to <0.5%. Cell viability was checked with a MTT kit after treatment with curcumin, calphostin-C, herbimycin-A, and other inhibitors as described in the text. Ten different pSVL-based UGT-cDNAs were transfected into COS-1 cells for specific protein expression as previously described (2Ritter J.K. Crawford J.M. Owens I.S. J. Biol.

Protein content was estimated using the BCA kit (Pierce), and it represents picomoles of glucuronide/mg of protein/per unit time. Western Blot Analysis of UGTs and Protein Kinases in Cells—Relative amounts of UGT in transfected-COS-1 and LS180 cells were established by Western blot as previously established (5Basu N.K. Kole L.

Blots were exposed to antibody specific for the protein of βII-, δ-, γ-, and ζ-PKC (not shown), of α- and ϵ-PKC, of MAP44/42 or to antibody specific for the phosphate group in PKCϵ (Ser-729), PKCα (Ser-657), or MAP44/42 according to supplier's instructions. Membranes were exposed to appropriate secondary antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and visualized as described for anti-UGT. In Situ Labeling of UGT and PKCϵ with [33P]Orthophosphate—To determine whether UGTs undergo phosphorylation, LS180 cells were grown to nearly 100% confluency and processed as previously described (7Basu N.K. Kovarova M. Garza A. Kubota S. Saha T. Mitra P.S. Banerjee R. Rivera J. Owens I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6285-6290Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Akhand A.A. Pu M.

All conditioned cells were exposed to [33P]orthophosphate and to curcumin for 1–8 h to allow maximum inhibition and recovery or to calphostin-C for the final hour. Cells were harvested and solubilized; equal protein was allowed to immunocomplex with anti-UGT-CE, washed (12Ritter J.K. Sheen Y.Y. Owens I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7900-7906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and subjected to electrophoresis in a SDS-7.5% PAGE system. Similarly, solubilized cell extracts were immunocomplexed with anti-PKCϵ protein backbone, washed, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Finally, the UGT-or PKCϵ-containing gel was fixed, dried, and scanned for quantitation as described for [14C]glucuronides (15Ciotti M. Owens I.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10119-10124Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both gels were exposed to x-ray film. Co-localization Studies—To determine whether UGT1A7His and phospho-PKCϵ co-localize, COS-1 cells, grown on Lab-Tek slides (Nalgene, Frederick, MD), were transfected (7Basu N.K. Kovarova M. Garza A.

For PKCδ and UGT1A10His co-localization, rabbit anti-PKCδ and mouse anti-His tag were added to UGT1A10His-transfected cells and subsequently visualized with donkey anti-rabbit-FITC conjugate and donkey anti-mouse TRITC conjugate, respectively. All cells were exposed to DAPI fluorescein to identify nuclei. Co-localization of PKCα and ER marker proteins, calnexin or calreticulin, in control cells was analyzed as follows: mouse anti-PKCα and rabbit anti-calnexin were added to cells and visualized with donkey anti-mouse TRITC and donkey anti-rabbit FITC conjugate, respectively. Also, co-localization of PKCα and calreticulin was determined by exposing cells to mouse anti-PKCα and rabbit anti-calreticulin and visualized with donkey anti-mouse TRITC conjugate and donkey anti-rabbit FITC conjugate, respectively. Treatment of LS180 Cells with Agonists and Antagonists for PKCs—To show significant enzyme activation, we first inhibited cellular UGT activity with curcumin treatment before exposure to calyculin-A, DAG, PMA, or PS. Additionally, LS180 cells were treated with agonist or antagonist PKCϵ-specific peptide for different times as shown. For peptides lacking a cellular-permeating conjugate, cells were grown to confluency before permeabilizing with 45 μg/ml saponin (18Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Permeabilized cells were exposed to medium containing octapeptide (Oct) represented in the V1 region of PKCϵ (19Csukai M.

Treatment of UGT1A7-transfected COS-1 Cells with PKCϵ-specific siRNA—PKCϵ-specific siRNA (100 nm) or its control (Dharmacon) was transfected according to the source's protocol into COS-1 cells, which had expressed UGT1A7His for 24 h; treatment continued for 48 h before harvesting cells for eugenol and mycophenolic acid (shown) glucuronidation as described above in 2-h incubations. Co-immunoprecipitation Studies—COS-1 cells that expressed UGT1A7-, UGT1A10-, or each corresponding His construct were untreated or treated with curcumin or calphostin-C, harvested, solubilized in cold Kinexus lysis buffer (Kinexus, Vancouver, Canada) (modified Kinexus lysis buffer contained 20 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 3.2, 20 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 3 mm benzamidine, 5 μm pepstatin, 10 μm leupeptin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm CHAPS adjusted to pH 7.2), fractionated by centrifugation at 60,000 × g for 30 min, and subjected to co-immunoprecipitation as previously described using anti-UGT-CE or anti-His. Immunoprecipitates were resolved in SDS-PAGE gel systems and transblotted as described for Western blot analysis using antibodies given in respective figure legends. In Vitro Transcription, Translation, and PKCϵ-dependent Phosphorylation of Nascent UGT1A7—The UGT1A7cDNA was inserted at the XbaI/BamH1 cloning site of pcDNA3.1 (–)/Myc-HisB (Invitrogen) downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter followed by the polyadenylation consensus sequence; the construct was linearized by digesting with SmaI. Purified 1A7-containing construct was transcribed into mRNA, which was subsequently translated into UGT1A7Myc-His using a TnTR T7 Coupled Wheat Germ extract system (Promega) that was incubated 90 min at 30 °C according to the manufacturer's protocol. To newly synthesized UGT1A7His, 10 ng of PKCϵ, 75 μm [γ-33P]ATP (2.2 μCi/pmol), and other kinasing reactants (Upstate) were combined in 60 μl and allowed to react for 20 min at 30 °C according to the manufacturer's protocol. Aliquots (10 μl) of the reaction mixture were added to P81 cellulose membrane, washed with 0.75% phosphoric acid and acetone, air dried, and counted using a liquid scintillation system according to a Promega protocol. Also, the 250-μl reaction system was solubilized with an equal volume of 2× Kinexus buffer, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was added to Ni+-charged resin (Sigma), and the purification strategy followed the source's protocol. Duplicate 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE systems were loaded with processed samples and electrophoresed; one gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film for development, and the duplicate gel was transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed by Western blot as previously described using anti-His and anti-UGT-CE as already described. Treatment of LS180 Cells with Catalase and Hydrogen Peroxide—To test effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on constitutive UGT activity, untreated LS180 cells were exposed to different concentrations of catalase or herbimycin-A. Also, cells were treated with different concentrations of H2O2 or combinations of H2O2 and catalase or herbimycin-A (20Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y.

Inhibition of UGTs Expressed in COS-1 and LS180 Cells by Curcumin or Calphostin-C Treatment—Our attempts to uncover special UGT properties associated with function began with a screen to discover new regulatory molecules among UGT substrates. While comparing in-cell treatment of two members, UGT1A7 and 1A10, of human UGT1A family that have similar properties, 1A7 was dramatically down-regulated by 200 μm curcumin, but 1A10 showed minor inhibition (Fig. 1A). With appropriate concentrations, there was rapid inhibition with recovery for all UGTs tested, re-exposure to curcumin caused the cycle to repeat for the three times tested (data not shown), suggesting the involvement of signaling events (24Surh Y.-J.

Interestingly, curcumin behaved as a typical substrate under in vitro conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2106448981,"In polyglutamine (polyQ) degeneration, disease protein that carries an expanded polyQ tract is neurotoxic. Expanded polyQ protein exists in different conformations that display distinct solubility properties. In this study, an inducible transgenic Drosophila model is established to define the pathogenic form of polyQ protein at an early stage of degeneration in vivo. We show that microscopic polyQ aggregates are neither pathogenic nor protective. Further, no toxic effect of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) -soluble polyQ protein is observed in our model. By means of filtration, 2 forms of SDS-insoluble protein species are identified according to their size. Coexpression of an ATPase-defective form of the molecular chaperone Hsc70 (Hsc70-K71S) selectively reduces the abundance of the large SDS-insoluble polyQ species, but such modulation has no modifying effects on degeneration. Notably, we detect a distinct Hsc70-K71S-resistant, small, SDS-insoluble polyQ oligomeric species that is closely correlated with degeneration. Our data highlight the toxic role of SDS-insoluble oligomers in polyQ degeneration in vivo."

As a first step toward understanding the Ca2+-induced conformational changes important for membrane-targeting, we report here the x-ray crystal structure of FCaBP in the Ca2+-free state determined at 2.2Å resolution. The first 17 residues from the N terminus appear unstructured and solvent-exposed. Residues implicated in membrane targeting (Lys-19, Lys-22, and Lys-25) are flanked by an exposed N-terminal helix (residues 26-37), forming a patch of positive charge on the protein surface that may interact electrostatically with flagellar membrane targets. The four EF-hands in FCaBP each adopt a “closed conformation” similar to that seen in Ca2+-free calmodulin. The overall fold of FCaBP is closest to that of grancalcin and other members of the penta EF-hand superfamily. Unlike the dimeric penta EF-hand proteins, FCaBP lacks a fifth EF-hand and is monomeric. The unstructured N-terminal region of FCaBP suggests that its covalently attached myristoyl group at the N terminus may be solvent-exposed, in contrast to the highly sequestered myristoyl group seen in recoverin and GCAP1. NMR analysis demonstrates that the myristoyl group attached to FCaBP is indeed solvent-exposed in both the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound states, and myristoylation has no effect on protein structure and folding stability.

Neuron. 1993; 10: 523-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the resting dark state, recoverin binds two calcium ions and associates with retinal rod outer segment membranes through its exposed myristoyl group (6Zozulya S. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Science. 1993; 259: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Photoexcitation of the rod cell results in a lowering of cytosolic calcium (14Koch K.W. Stryer L. Nature. 1988; 334: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), causing recoverin to lose its bound calcium and adopt a conformation in which the myristoyl group becomes sequestered within a hydrophobic cleft in the protein (9Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Ca2+-free recoverin then dissociates from rhodopsin kinase at the membrane, allowing rhodopsin kinase to phosphorylate light-excited rhodopsin and promote receptor inactivation. The calcium-myristoyl switch mechanism allows calcium regulation of two proteins (rhodopsin kinase and rhodopsin) that do not themselves bind calcium. One major difference between FCaBP and recoverin is the presence of palmitate in FCaBP, which may or may not participate in a potential switch mechanism. A variety of FCaBP-like proteins are found in other trypanosomes: Trypanosoma rangeli, Trypanosoma lewisi, and Trypanosoma brucei (Fig. 1). A flagellar calmodulin has also been characterized in T. brucei (15Ridgley E. Webster P. Patton C. Ruben L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 109: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These Ca2+-binding proteins all localize to the flagellum, a unique organelle that has many functions, including motility, chemotaxis, and cell signaling. In addition to the traditional “9 + 2” microtubule structure of the axoneme, there is a structure known as the paraflagellar rod that runs alongside the axoneme. The axoneme, paraflagellar rod, and flagelloplasm are encased by the flagellar membrane. It has been shown by freeze-fracture analysis that the flagellar membrane contains a higher concentration of sterols than does the pellicular (cell body) membrane (16Tetley L. Acta Trop. 1986; 43: 307-317PubMed Google Scholar), and the flagellum of T. brucei is highly enriched in lipid rafts. Flagellar membrane stability and function is also controlled by the recruitment of FCaBP to the membrane surface, where it is believed to interact with a variety of membrane-bound protein targets (4Buchanan K.T. Ames J.B. Asfaw S.H. Wingard J.N. Olson C.L. Campana P.T. Araujo A.P. Engman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40104-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We report here the x-ray crystal structure of Ca2+-free FCaBP as a first step toward understanding the Ca2+-induced conformational changes that control membrane targeting. This is only the second atomic resolution structure of a Ca2+-acyl switch protein in the Ca2+-free state. The structure of Ca2+-free recoverin first showed its covalently attached myristoyl group to be highly sequestered and buried deep inside the protein (17Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Harvey T.S. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1995; 376: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Also, the recent crystal structure of Ca2+-bound GCAP1 indicates a sequestered myristoyl group (18Stephen R. Bereta G. Golczak M. Palczewski K. Sousa M.C. Structure. 2007; 15: 1392-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). By contrast, the structure of Ca2+-free FCaBP in this study suggests a solvent-exposed N terminus, making its covalently attached acyl groups accessible to interact with membrane targets. We propose that the exposed acyl groups and N-terminal positively charged residues (Lys-19, -22, and -25) may promote the binding of FCaBP to the flagellar membrane and that Ca2+-induced protein conformational changes may control its binding to membrane-bound protein targets. Protein Expression and Purification—To prepare recombinant unmyristoylated FCaBP (and Se-methionine-labeled FCaBP), FCaBP tagged with a C-terminal His6 tract was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) carrying a derivative of the pET23d vector (Novagen) as previously described (4Buchanan K.T. Ames J.B. Asfaw S.H. Wingard J.N. Olson C.L. Campana P.T. Araujo A.P. Engman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40104-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with or without Se-methionine, according to well established procedures (19Muchmore D.C.

Recombinant unmyristoylated FCaBP for the native crystal was expressed as above in LB media and was initially purified via nickel affinity chromatography. Peak fractions were pooled and diluted 3-fold with buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and applied to a Q-HP HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) at 5 ml/min. FCaBP was eluted with a 200-ml linear KCl gradient to a final concentration of 250 mm KCl. Peak fractions were pooled, and purified FCaBP was dialyzed and concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol in a centrifugal filter device with a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff (Amicon). Recombinant myristoylated FCaBP was generated by co-expressing FCaBP and N-myristoyl CoA transferase (pBB131-NMT) in BL21(DE3) cells grown on M9 medium supplemented with myristic acid (10 mg/liter). Myristoylated and non-myristoylated FCaBP was purified from the soluble fraction of bacterial cell lysates using Ni2+-chelate affinity chromatography on a nitrilotriacetate resin (Qiagen) according the manufacturer's instructions. Peak fractions were then applied to an anion-exchange column (Hi-Trap DEAE-FF, GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A (1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and eluted with a linear salt gradient (0-0.2 m KCl) at flow rate of 5 ml min-1 over the course of 150 min. Peak fractions were concentrated to 5 ml and subjected to size exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl S-100, GE Healthcare) in buffer B (1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Final purity was greater than 98%, as judged by SDS-PAGE. Protein Crystallization—Two different native crystals were grown by the hanging drop method (22Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). Crystal form #1 was obtained by combining 900 μl of original well solution (3.2 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0) with 100 μl of Opti-Salts (Qiagen) optimization solution (0.75 m magnesium chloride and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6). Crystal form #2 was obtained using a well solution containing solely 3.2 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0. The selenomethionine protein crystal was grown in a sitting drop with the well solution containing 3.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m MES, pH 5.7. The drop was made with 6 μl of protein (20 mg/ml) and 3 μl of well solution. All crystallizations were at room temperature. X-ray Crystallography—Diffraction data for the native structure (from crystal #1) were collected using a Rigaku Micro Max 007 rotating anode generator (Rigaku/MSC, The Woodlands, TX). The crystal was cooled to 100 K with a Cryocool low temperature probe (Cryo Industries of America) and was cryoprotected by pulling the loop mounted crystal through immersion oil. The diffraction data were processed with CrystalClear/d*Trek (23Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Statistics are shown in Table 1 (crystal #1). Single wavelength anomalous dispersion data for the selenomethionine protein were collected at Brookhaven National Laboratory on beamline X29 using the wavelength 0.9790 Å and processed with HKL2000 (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). When the anomalous data were processed in space group P212121, 15,413 measurements were rejected. With space group P1, only 442 reflections were rejected, and the 33 Å axis was identified as the screw axis. When processed in space group P21, 504 reflections were rejected. The anomalous signal was weak but usable to 2.6 Å. The software program, SHELXC/D/E (25Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar, 26Sheldrick G.M. Kristallogr. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar) was used to find eight selenium sites and examine the hand of the sites. A reasonable value for the Matthews coefficient (1.8) indicated that there were two molecules in the asymmetric unit for space group P21 or one for P212121. The selenium sites were used in SOLVE/RESOLVE (27Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 28Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) to produce an electron density map, and the map was examined in COOT (29Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and looked good. Using the iterative script, which includes cycles of density modification and automated model building by RESOLVE and molecular refinement by REFMAC5 (30Murshudov D.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 140-255Crossref Scopus (13914) Google Scholar), 271 of the 422 residues were built, and 104 side chains were placed. The model was completed by iteratively building in COOT and refining in REFMAC5. The model was transferred to the native data and refined in both space group P21 and P212121. The model and the statistics were essentially the same. There was no compelling reason to use P21 for the native data so the final statistics for the P212121 space group are shown in Table 2. The final model includes residues 17-208. The side chains of 11 residues were modeled with double conformations, and Cys-66 was modeled as s-oxy cysteine. The sequence has four methionines, but the selenium sites seen were 122M, 145m, and a double conformation for 135M. The loop region including residues 102-113 has minimal density, but the path is clear. In a Ramachandran plot, 97.8% of the residues fall into the preferred regions, and 2.2% fall into the allowed regions as analyzed by COOT.TABLE 1Data statistics tableNativeSeMetSpace groupP212121P21Cell parameters (a, b, c) (Å)32.91, 37.67, 141.3337.71, 32.91, 140.88Cell parameters (α, β, γ) (°)90.0, 90.0, 90.090.0, 90.0, 90.0Wavelength of data collection (Å)1.5410.979No. of measured intensities53,30552,133No. of unique reflections12,55818,011Resolution of data (Å)29.8-2.030.0-2.1Highest resolution shell (Å)2.07-2.002.18-2.10Rsym (overall/high resolution shell)0.070/0.3080.059/0.261Completeness (%) (overall/high resolution shell)99.8/97.987.3/45.6Redundancy (overall/high resolution shell)4.2/4.15.9/2.4Mean I/σ (overall/high resolution shell)10.9/4.111.1/2.5 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Refinement statistics tableResolution limits (Å)20.0-2.0Number of reflections used/for Rfree11,896/600R-factor (overall/high resolution shell)0.211/0.251Rfree (overall/high resolution shell)0.289/0.339Number of water molecules65r.m.s.d. bond length (Å)0.019r.m.s.d. angle (°)1.73Average B main chain/side chain/water (Å2)30.3/31.7/32.4 Open table in a new tab NMR Spectroscopy—Samples for NMR analysis consisted of 15N-labeled FCaBP with and without a covalently attached, 13C-labeled myristoyl group. FCaBP protein for NMR studies (1.0 mm) was dissolved in 0.3 ml of a 95% H2O, 5% [2H]H2O solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 2 mm EDTA (Ca2+-free) or 2 mm CaCl2 (Ca2+-bound). All NMR experiments were performed at 25 °C on a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer equipped with a four-channel interface and triple-resonance probe with triple-axis pulsed field gradients and a DRX-600 spectrometer equipped with an Ultrashield Bruker magnet, a three-channel interface, and a cryo-probe with z axis pulsed field gradients. The 1H,15N HSQC spectra (see Fig. 4) were recorded on a sample of 15N-labeled FCaBP (in 95% H2O, 5% 2H2O). The number of complex points and acquisition times were: 256, 180 ms (15N(F1)); 512, 64 ms (1H(F2)). The 13C,1H HMQC spectra (see Fig. 5) and 13C (F1)-edited, 13C (F3)-filtered NOESY-HMQC spectra were recorded on a sample of unlabeled FCaBP protein attached to 13C-labeled myristate (31Ames J.B. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30909-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as well as 13C-labeled FCaBP bound to unlabeled myristate (data not shown). Intermolecular NOESY experiments were performed as described previously (32Lee W. Revington M.J. Arrowsmith C. Kay L.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).FIGURE 5The N-terminal myristoyl group of FCaBP appears to be solvent-exposed. Two-dimensional (1H,13C HMQC) NMR spectra of free myristic acid dissolved in chloroform (A) and the myristoyl group of Ca2+-free (B) and Ca2+-bound (C) FCaBP. The myristoyl group was labeled with carbon-13, and the protein was unlabeled.

Saturation was carried out with a series of 120° 1H pulses separated by 5 ms delays applied during the interscan delay (3 s). Protein Crystallization—Recombinant FCaBP crystallized in the orthorhombic space group, P212121, with one molecule of FCaBP in the asymmetric unit. It is seen to be monomeric in the crystal, as measured in solution by NMR and dynamic light scattering analysis. The polypeptide structure derived from diffraction data on crystal #1 (in the presence of saturating Mg2+) and crystal #2 (apo-form) appear virtually identical except for very minor differences in the EF2 loop structure (residues, 102-113), suggesting that Mg2+ has almost no effect on the overall structure. In each crystal form, the first 17 residues from the N terminus appear disordered. Amino acid sequencing of the protein from dissolved crystals showed that all 17 N-terminal residues remained intact in both crystal forms and, therefore, were not cleaved by proteolysis during crystallization. Three-dimensional Structure—The x-ray crystal structure of Ca2+-free FCaBP was solved at 2.2 Å resolution, with a final R-factor of 16.95% and R-free of 21.97% (Fig. 2). The entire polypeptide chain has been traced except for the first 17 residues from the N terminus. High temperature factors for the N-terminal residues suggest they may be dynamically disordered. NMR relaxation studies and heteronuclear 15N nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) analysis on FCaBP also confirms that the first 17 N-terminal residues are indeed unstructured (data not shown) and the N-terminal myristoyl group is solvent-exposed (see below). The overall main chain structure for residues 17-208 of FCaBP determined by x-ray crystallography was consistent with and nearly identical to a much lower resolution NMR solution structure (not shown). The protein structure visible in the crystal has a globular fold with overall dimensions of 32 × 23 × 21 Å (Fig. 2). The first structured residue in the crystal begins at Ala-18 that marks the start of an exposed, 5-residue conformation (residues 18-23), resembling a hook that forms a right angle with an adjacent α-helix (residues 24-37). After this N-terminal helix is a compact arrangement of four EF-hands: EF1 (residues 49-77, green); EF2 (residues 98-126, red); EF3 (residues 131-159, cyan); EF4 (residues 168-196, yellow). Overall, FCaBP contains a total of eight α-helices and four β-strands: α1 (residues 24-37), α2 (residues 44-57), α3 (residues 67-76), α4 (residues 87-105), α5 (residues 116-139), α6 (149-162), α7 (residues 169-176), α8 (residues 186-201), β1 (residues 64-66), β2 (residues 113-115), β3 (residues 146-148), and β4 (residues 183-185) (Fig. 1). The four EF-hands of FCaBP associate into two pairs through a characteristic, short, two-stranded β-sheet arrangement, EF1 (green) pairs with EF2 (red), whereas EF3 (cyan) pairs with EF4 (yellow). The two pairs of EF-hands are connected by a long, central helix (α5) formed by merging the exiting helix of EF2 into the entering helix of EF3. This topology causes three long, central helices (α4, α5, and α8) to interact closely as a twisted, vertical bundle. As a consequence, EF2 and EF4 make close contact with one another. This globular arrangement of EF-hands is most similar to that seen for the first four EF-hands in the penta-EF-hand proteins, grancalcin (37Jia J. Han Q. Borregaard N. Lollike K. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and domain IV of calpain (38Blanchard H. Grochulski P. Li Y. Arthur J.S. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Cygler M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 1997; 4: 532-538Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, unlike penta-EF-hand proteins, FCaBP lacks a fifth EF-hand and is not dimeric. EF-hands and Ca2+ Binding—The individual metal-free EF-hands in FCaBP each consist of a helix-turn-helix structure similar to the closed conformation of EF-hands seen in previous Ca2+-free structures of calmodulin (39Schumacher M.A. Crum M. Miller M.C. Structure. 2004; 12: 849-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 40Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct.

Biol. 2000; 300: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The interhelical angles for the “closed” EF-hands in FCaBP are 119° (EF1), 128° (EF2), 122° (EF3), and 120° (EF4). The binding of Ca2+ to each EF-hand in calmodulin causes a marked decrease in interhelical angle that promotes formation of an open conformation, leading to the exposure of many hydrophobic residues that interact with protein targets (42Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 43Vetter S.W. Leclerc E. Eur. J.

Indeed, Ca2+-dependent membrane binding by FCaBP might arise in part by its Ca2+-induced binding to protein targets localized on the flagellar membrane surface. The 12-residue Ca2+ binding loop of EF2 in FCaBP appears loosely structured in crystal form #1 and adopts an unusual, distorted conformation in crystal form #2, which may explain why EF2 is not able to bind Ca2+ (4Buchanan K.T. Ames J.B. Asfaw S.H. Wingard J.N. Olson C.L. Campana P.T. Araujo A.P. Engman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40104-40111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The instability and/or structural distortion of the EF2 loop may be due in part to the presence of G109 at position-3 in the binding loop, which lacks an acidic side chain required for Ca2+ chelation at this key position. The lack of Ca2+ binding at EF2 may also explain why Ca2+ is not able to bind to EF1, as the helices of EF1 and EF2 interlock to form a four-helix bundle, causing both EF-hands to be cooperatively locked in the Ca2+-free closed conformation. In addition, Cys-66 at position 9 in the EF1 loop is not able to form a hydrogen bond with Glu-69, which may destabilize the binding-loop structure and prevent Ca2+ binding at EF1. By contrast, EF3 and EF4 both adopt a more favorable conformation for binding Ca2+, consistent with functional Ca2+ binding measured at these sites (4Buchanan K.T. Ames J.B. Asfaw S.H. Wingard J.N.

In the Ca2+ binding loop of EF3, side-chain oxygen atoms from residues Asp-140, Ser-142, Asn-144, and Glu-151 are held in a cage-like arrangement surrounding a bound H2O molecule (Fig. 2A) that resembles the binding of Ca2+ with the familiar pentagonal bipyramid geometry (3Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). For EF4, side-chain oxygen atoms from residues Asp-177, Asn-179, Thr-181, and Glu-188 are also pre-arranged with a similar geometry that surrounds a bound H2O. In addition, the main-chain nitrogen of the sixth residue in the Ca2+ binding loops of EF3 (M145) and EF4 (G182) both form hydrogen bonds with aspartate at the one position, forming a loop conformation characteristic of Ca2+-bound calmodulin and troponin C. Therefore, the Ca2+ bindin"
https://openalex.org/W2063084727,"The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and ErbB family of receptors are receptor tyrosine kinases that play important roles in cancer. Lack of response and resistance to therapies targeting ErbB receptors occur and are often associated with activation of the IGF-1R pathway. Combinations of agents that inhibit IGF-1R and ErbB receptors have been shown to synergistically block cancer cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth. To determine the mechanism by which targeting both IGF-1R and ErbB receptors causes synergistic effects on cell growth and survival, we investigated the effects of combinations of selective IGF-1R and ErbB kinase inhibitors on proliferative and apoptotic signaling. We identified A431 squamous cell carcinoma cells as most sensitive to combinations of ErbB and IGF-1R inhibitors. The inhibitor combinations resulted in not only blockade of A431 cell proliferation, but also induced apoptosis, which was not seen with either agent alone. Upon examining phosphorylation states and expression levels of proteins in the IGF-1R and ErbB signaling pathways, we found a correlation between the ability of combinations to inhibit proliferation and to decrease levels of phosphorylated Akt and cyclin D1. In addition, the massive cell death induced by combined IGF-1R/ErbB inhibition was associated with Mcl-1 reduction and Bax activation. Thus, targeting both IGF-1R and ErbB receptors simultaneously results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through combined effects on Akt, cyclin D1, and Bax activation."
https://openalex.org/W2065421958,"In skeletal muscle, coupling between the 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) underlies excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. The III-IV loop of the DHPR α1S subunit binds to a segment of RyR1 in vitro, and mutations in the III-IV loop alter the voltage dependence of EC coupling, raising the possibility that this loop is directly involved in signal transmission from the DHPR to RyR1. To clarify the role of the α1S III-IV loop in EC coupling, we examined the functional properties of a chimera (GFP-α1S[III-IVa]) in which the III-IV loop of the divergent α1A isoform replaced that of α1S. Dysgenic myotubes expressing GFP-α1S[III-IVa] yielded myoplasmic Ca2+ transients that activated at ∼10 mV more hyperpolarized potentials and that were ∼65% smaller than those of GFP-α1S. A similar reduction was observed in voltage-dependent charge movements for GFP-α1S[III-IVa], indicating that the chimeric channels trafficked less well to the membrane but that those that were in the membrane functioned as efficiently in EC coupling as GFP-α1S. Relative to GFP-α1S, L-type currents mediated by GFP-α1S[III-IVa] were ∼40% smaller and activated at ∼5 mV more hyperpolarized potentials. The altered gating of GFP-α1S[III-IVa] was accentuated by exposure to ±Bay K 8644, which caused a much larger hyperpolarizing shift in activation compared with its effect on GFP-α1S. Taken together, our observations indicate that the α1S III-IV loop is not directly involved in EC coupling but does influence DHPR gating transitions important both for EC coupling and activation of L-type conductance. In skeletal muscle, coupling between the 1,4-dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) underlies excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. The III-IV loop of the DHPR α1S subunit binds to a segment of RyR1 in vitro, and mutations in the III-IV loop alter the voltage dependence of EC coupling, raising the possibility that this loop is directly involved in signal transmission from the DHPR to RyR1. To clarify the role of the α1S III-IV loop in EC coupling, we examined the functional properties of a chimera (GFP-α1S[III-IVa]) in which the III-IV loop of the divergent α1A isoform replaced that of α1S. Dysgenic myotubes expressing GFP-α1S[III-IVa] yielded myoplasmic Ca2+ transients that activated at ∼10 mV more hyperpolarized potentials and that were ∼65% smaller than those of GFP-α1S.

In that study, the chimera containing the α1S II-III loop was the only chimera with a single loop substitution that was capable of restoring EC coupling similar to that observed for wild-type α1S when expressed in dysgenic myotubes. Subsequently, the experimental approach of expressing progressively more complex α1S/α1C chimeras in dysgenic myotubes identified a subdomain within the α1S II-III loop (residues 720–765, the “critical domain”) that was necessary to support skeletal-type EC coupling (“orthograde coupling”) (20Nakai J.

Nature. 2004; 429: 670-675Crossref Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The α1S amino terminus does not play a major role in EC coupling, because deletion of the bulk of the amino terminus has little effect on EC coupling (38Bannister R.A. Beam K.G. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 2005; 336: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In contrast to the relatively well defined roles of the other intracellular regions of α1S in EC coupling, little is known about the contribution of the α1S III-IV loop. A potentially important role for the α1S III-IV loop in EC coupling was first raised by its identification as the locus for the only DHPR mutations (R1086H and R1086C) currently linked to malignant hyperthermia (39Monnier N. Procaccio V. Stieglitz P. Lunardi J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 1316-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of the R1086H mutant channel expressed in a dysgenic cell line showed that the α1S R1086H mutation causes a hyperpolarizing shift in the activation of myoplasmic Ca2+ transients (40Weiss R.G. O'Connell K.M.S. Flucher B.E. Allen P.D. Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1094-C1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, the α1S III-IV loop has also been identified as a potential site of DHPR-RyR1 protein-protein interaction by virtue of the ability of an α1S III-IV loop-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein to bind a purified fragment of RyR1 (residues 922–1112) in vitro (41Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29958-29964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Previous studies seeking to identify α1S cytoplasmic domains important for EC coupling have made use of chimeras of α1S and α1C (10Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 42Carbonneau L. Bhattacharya D. Sheridan D.C. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 243-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although these studies have been invaluable, they have not been revealing about the III-IV loop because it is highly conserved between α1S and α1C (46/53 residues conserved). To test the contribution of the α1S III-IV loop to EC coupling more stringently, we examined the functional characteristics of an α1S-based chimera that incorporated the relatively nonconserved (29 of 53 residues) III-IV loop of the neuronal P/Q-type channel α1A in place of the α1S III-IV loop. Our results indicate that the α1S III-IV loop influences conformational transitions of the DHPR, including transitions important for EC coupling. However, it is unlikely to represent a DHPR-RyR1 site of contact that is necessary for EC coupling. Myotube Culture and Expression of cDNA—All of the procedures involving mice were approved by the University of Colorado-Denver Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Primary cultures of dysgenic myotubes were prepared from newborn mice as described previously (43Beam K.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Methods Cell Biol. 1997; 52: 283-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For electrophysiological experiments, myoblasts were plated on 35-mm ECL-coated, plastic culture dishes (number 353801; Falcon, San Jose, CA). Cultures were grown for 6–7 days in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (number 15-017-CM; Mediatech, Herndon, VA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum/10% horse serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). This medium was then replaced with differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum). Two to four days after the switch to differentiation medium, single nuclei were microinjected with cDNA (400 ng/μl) encoding either GFP-α1S or GFP-α1S[III-IVa]. GFP-α1S (GenBank™ accession number X05921) and GFP-α1S[III-IVa] were constructed as previously described (44Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 29Flucher B.E. Kasielke N. Grabner M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Measurement of Ionic Currents—Myotubes were used in electrophysiological experiments 2 days following injection. Pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass and had resistances of ∼1.5 MΩ when filled with internal solution, which consisted of 140 mm cesium aspartate, 10 mm Cs2-EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with CsOH. The external solution contained 145 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.003 mm tetrodotoxin, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with tetraethylammonium-OH. In some experiments, L-type currents were recorded in the continuous presence of racemic Bay K 8644 (10 μm; kindly supplied by Dr. A. Scriabine, Miles Laboratories Inc., New Haven, CT) in the bath solution. Linear capacitative and leakage currents were determined by averaging the currents elicited by eleven 30-mV hyperpolarizing pulses from a holding potential of -80 mV. Test currents were corrected for linear components of leak and capacitive current by digital scaling and subtraction of this average control current. Electronic compensation was used to reduce the effective series resistance (usually to <1 mΩ) and the time constant for charging the linear cell capacitance (usually to <0.5 ms). Ionic currents were filtered at 2 kHz (eight pole Bessel filter; Frequency Devices, Inc.) and digitized at 10 kHz. To measure macroscopic L-type current in isolation, a 1-s prepulse to -20 mV followed by a 50-ms repolarization to -50 mV was administered before the test pulse (prepulse protocol) (11Adams B.A. Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) to inactivate T-type Ca2+ channels. Cell capacitance was determined by integration of a transient from -80 mV to -70 mV using Clampex 8.0 (Axon Instrument, Foster City, CA) and was used to normalize current amplitudes (pA/pF). Current-voltage (I-V) curves were fitted using the following Boltzmann expression,I=Gmax*(V-Vrev)/{1+exp[-(V-V1/2)/kG]}(Eq. 1) where I is the current for the test potential V, Vrev is the reversal potential, Gmax is the maximum Ca2+ channel conductance, V½ is the half-maximal activation potential, and kG is the slope factor. Tail-current amplitude (Itail) was measured 1 ms after the onset of the repolarization from the test pulse to -50 mV (45Wilkens C.M. Grabner M. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ Transients—Changes in intracellular Ca2+ were recorded with Fluo-3 (F-3715; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the whole cell configuration. The salt form of the dye was added to the standard internal solution for a final concentration of 200 nm. After entry into the whole cell configuration, a waiting period of >5 min was used to allow the dye to diffuse into the cell interior. A 100-W mercury illuminator and a set of fluorescein filters were used to excite the dye present in a small rectangular region of the voltage-clamped myotube. A computer-controlled shutter was used to block illumination in the intervals between test pulses. Fluorescence emission was measured by means of a fluorometer apparatus (Biomedical Instrumentation Group, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). The average background fluorescence was quantified before bath immersion of the patch pipette. Fluorescence data are expressed as ΔF/F, where ΔF represents the change in peak fluorescence from base line during the test pulse, and F is the fluorescence immediately prior to the test pulse minus the average background (non-Fluo-3) fluorescence. Unless otherwise noted, the peak value of the fluorescence change (ΔF/F) for each test potential (V) was fitted according to the following equation,(ΔF/F)=(ΔF/F)max/{1+exp[(VF-V)/kF]}(Eq. 2) where (ΔF/F)max is the maximal fluorescence change, VF is the potential causing half the maximal change in fluorescence, and kF is a slope parameter. Electrically Evoked Contractions—Contractions were elicited by 20-ms, 100-V stimuli applied via an extracellular pipette that contained 150 mm NaCl and was placed near intact myotubes expressing constructs of interest. The myotubes were bathed in rodent Ringer's solution (146 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 11 mm glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH). Contractions were assayed by the movement of an identifiable portion of a myotube across the visual field. Measurement of Charge Movements—For recordings of immobilization-resistant intramembrane charge movements as a measure of functional DHPR channel expression, ionic currents were blocked by the addition of 0.5 mm CdCl2 + 0.1 mm LaCl3 to the standard extracellular recording solution. All of the charge movements were corrected for linear cell capacitance and leakage currents using a -P/8 subtraction protocol (46Bannister R.A. Colecraft H.M. Beam K.G. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 2631-2638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Filtering was at 2 kHz, and digitization was at 20 kHz. Voltage clamp command pulses were exponentially rounded with a time constant of 50–500 μs, and the prepulse protocol (see above) was used to reduce the contribution of gating currents from voltagegated Na+ channels and T-type Ca2+ channels. The integral of the depolarization transient (Qon) for each test potential (V) was fitted according to the following equation,Qon=Qmax/{1+exp[(VQ-V)/kQ]}(Eq. 3) where Qmax is the maximal Qon, VQ is the potential causing movement of half the maximal charge, and kQ is a slope parameter. Analysis—The figures were made using the software program SigmaPlot (version 7.0, Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA). All of the data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were by unpaired, two-tailed t test (as appropriate), with p < 0.05 considered significant. The primary experimental approach that has been used to determine the contributions of the α1S cytoplasmic domains to skeletal-type EC coupling is to characterize Ca2+ transients produced by chimeras of α1S and α1C (10Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 20Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol.

J. 2005; 89: 243-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, this approach is of limited value for the III-IV loop because it is highly conserved between α1S and α1C (Fig. 1A). In the present study, we examined the functional characteristics of a chimera in which the less conserved III-IV loop of the α1A subunit of the neuronal high voltage-activated P/Q type channel was incorporated into the corresponding region of α1S (chimera GFP-α1S[III-IVa]; Fig. 1B). Ca2+ Release Is Reduced in Myotubes Expressing GFP-α1S[III-IVa]—Myoplasmic Ca2+ transients were measured in the whole cell patch clamp configuration to determine whether replacement of the α1S III-IV loop by that of α1A affects EC coupling. As shown in Fig. 2A, GFP-α1S expressing dysgenic myotubes produced robust Ca2+ transients with an average ΔF/Fmax of 0.75 ± 0.16 ΔF/F (n = 5). In contrast, dysgenic myotubes expressing GFP-α1S [III-IVa] yielded Ca2+ transients that were considerably smaller in magnitude (ΔF/Fmax = 0.27 ± 0.09; n = 5; p < 0.05; Fig. 2B). The reduction in ΔF/Fmax observed for GFP-α1S[III-IVa] was accompanied by a substantial (∼10 mV; p < 0.01) hyperpolarizing shift in voltage dependence of Ca2+ release (Fig. 2C and Table 1). This shift became more apparent when the respective ΔF/F-V curves were normalized to the average ΔF/F measured at +50 mV (Fig. 2D). Although the magnitude of Ca2+ release in response to depolarization from the sarcoplasmic reticulum was reduced in comparison with GFP-α1S, GFP-α1S[III-IVa] was still capable of producing myotube contractions evoked by extracellular electrical stimulation (10 of 16 myotubes tested; Table 1).TABLE 1ΔF/F – V parameters and electrically-evoked contractions The parameters for ΔF/F – V were obtained by best fits of the raw data according to Equation 2.

By comparison, L-type currents were smaller in dysgenic myotubes expressing GFP-α1S[III-IVa] (-3.1 ± 0.3 pA/pF; n = 20; p < 0.05; Fig. 3A, right panel). Based on fitting with Equation 1, there was also a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation for GFP-α1S[III-IVa] in comparison with GFP-α1S (V½ = 28.9 ± 1.0 mV versus 32.5 ± 1.5 mV, respectively; p < 0.05; Fig. 3B and Table 2). Based on this same analysis with Equation 1, the reduction in Gmax was ∼25%. It should be noted that the reversal potential for GFP-α1S[III-IVa] was routinely shifted by ∼10 mV to more hyperpolarized potentials (Fig. 3B). Such a shift in reversal potential is typical of low magnitude L-type currents recorded under similar conditions (47Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D.

Thus, we also used tail currents (Itail) to estimate relative conductances because these are unaffected by changes in apparent reversal potential (Fig. 3C). Tail currents at -50 mV upon repolarization from +40 mV (“Itail(40)”) were -11.2 ± 1.8 pA/pF in dysgenic myotubes expressing GFP-α1S (n = 13) and -6.3 ± 0.8 pA/pF in dysgenic myotubes expressing GFP-α1S[III-IVa] (n = 11; p < 0.05).TABLE 2Conductance and intramembrane charge movement The best fit parameters determined by fitting peak I-V data according to Equation 1 and Q-V data according to Equation 3.

A small hyperpolarizing shift was also observed for GFP-α1S[III-IVa], but this shift was not significant (Table 2). Importantly, the reduction in Qmax (Fig. 4B and Table 2) was nearly equal in magnitude to the reduction in maximal Ca2+ transients for GFP-α1S[III-IVa] (Fig. 2C and Table 1). Thus, GFP-α1S[III-IVa] appeared to have an ability to activate Ca2+ release via RyR1 that was similar to that of GFP-α1S (Fig. 4C, left panel). However, the reduction in peak Ca2+ current for GFP-α1S[III-IVa] (Fig. 3B) was smaller than the reduction in Qmax, suggesting that Po is higher for the chimeric channels. To assess the change in Po more directly, we calculated the ratio between Itail(40) and Q′, where Q′ is the measured, maximal charge (Qmax) corrected for the charge that is present in uninjected dysgenic myotubes (Qdys; 0.9 ± 0.2 nC/μF; n = 3). This ratio provides an indication of channel Po (11Adams B.A. Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 51Adams B.A. Mori Y. Kim M.S. Tanabe T. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The ratio Itail(40)/Q′ was substantially larger for GFP-α1S[III-IVa] than for GFP-α1S (3.2 versus 1.5 pA/fC, respectively; Fig. 4C, right panel, and Table 2). GFP-α1S[III-IVa] Is Potentiated by ±Bay K 8644—We wondered whether the elevated Po for GFP-α1S[III-IVa] would affect the response of the chimeric channel to the L-type Ca2+ channel agonist Bay K 8644, because this agent is also known to increase the Po of L-type channels. In agreement with previous work on native skeletal muscle L-type channels (52Adams B.A. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), application of ±Bay K 8644 (10 μm) caused an increase in peak current for GFP-α1S (Fig. 5A) that was relatively modest compared with the effect on native α1C (53Sanguinetti M.C. Kass R.S. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1984; 16: 667-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 54Thomas G. Chung M. Cohen C.J. Circ. Res. 1985; 56: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The most prominent effect was a slowing of tail current decay (Fig. 5A, inset), which was also seen for GFP-α1S[III-IVa] (Fig. 5B, inset). However, GFP-α1S[III-IVa] differed from GFP-α1S in that ±Bay K 8644 caused a pronounced leftward shift in activation (Fig. 5B and Table 2). This shift meant that the potentiation of peak current by ±Bay K 8644 was much greater for GFP-α1S[III-IVa] than for GFP-α1S at less depolarized potentials (Fig. 5C). The differential effect of ±Bay K 8644 is another indication that the III-IV loop influences gating transitions of the DHPR. In the current study, depolarization-triggered myoplasmic Ca2+ transients in dysgenic myotubes expressing GFP-α1S[III-IVa] were found to be activated ∼10 mV more negatively and to be reduced by ∼65% in amplitude, compared with those of GFP-α1S (Fig. 2 and Table 1). L-type Ca2+ currents were also reduced for GFP-α1S[III-IVa], but to a lesser extent (∼40%) than the Ca2+ transients, and were also shifted to more hyperpolarizing potentials (Fig. 3). Immobilization-resistant charge movements were reduced by ∼65% for GFP-α1S[III-IVa] (Fig. 4 and Table 2), similar to the reduction in the magnitude of Ca2+ transients but larger than the reduction in L-type Ca2+ currents. Calculation of the ratio between tail current amplitude (Itail(40)) and the charge attributable to DHPRs inserted into the membrane following construct cDNA injection (Q′) indicated that channel Po was increased about 2-fold for GFP-α1S[III-IVa] compared with GFP-α1S (Fig. 4). The hyperpolarizing shift in GFP-α1S[III-IVa] channel activation was accentuated by exposure to the L-type channel agonist ±Bay K 8644 (Fig. 5). The observation of a hyperpolarizing shift in Ca2+ release for GFP-α1S[III-IVa] compared with GFP-α1S (Fig. 2 and Table 1) supports the idea that the α1S III-IV loop is in some way involved in EC coupling. Such an involvement was proposed by Weiss et al. (40Weiss R.G. O'Connell K.M.S. Flucher B.E. Allen P.D. Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1094-C1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) on the basis of a similar hyperpolarizing shift for an α1S construct containing the R1086H point mutation, which is located in the III-IV loop and has been linked to the malignant hyperthermia phenotype. One possibility for the involvement of the α1S III-IV loop in controlling sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release would be by direct interaction with RyR1, as suggested by the in vitro binding of this loop to a fragment (residues 922–1112) of RyR1 (41Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29958-29964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). If such a direct interaction were important, one might predict that the efficiency of EC coupling would be reduced for GFP-α1S[III-IVa] because the sequence of its III-IV loop differs significantly from that of wild-type α1S (Fig. 1). As an indicator of this efficiency, we calculated the ratio of ΔF/Fmax (the maximum change in Fluo-3 fluorescence elicited by a 50-ms depolarization) to Q′ (which equals Qmax - Qdys and is the charge attributable to recombinant DHPRs in the plasma membrane) (11Adams B.A. Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Because the value of (ΔF/Fmax)/Q′ was very similar for GFP-α1S[III-IVa] and GFP-α1S (Fig. 4C), it seems unlikely that an interaction between the α1S III-IV loop and RyR1 plays an important role in EC coupling. Furthermore, the fraction of cells contracting in response to focal extracellular stimulation was similar for cells expressing GFP-α1S[III-IVa] and GFP-α1S (Table 1). This result supports the idea that the reduced number of GFP-α1S[III-IVa] channels in the plasma membrane were effectively targeted to junctions with RyR1 (29Flucher B.E. Kasielke N. Grabner M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and elicited local Ca2+ release fluxes comparable with those elicited by GFP-α1S. Although our data provide evidence against a direct interaction of the α1S III-IV loop with RyR1, they are consistent with the hypothesis that this loop is important for regulating gating transitions of other regions of the DHPR that are coupled directly to activation of RyR1. In particular, we observed that three features of L-type Ca2+ current were significantly altered for GFP-α1S[III-IVa]: 1) activation was shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction, 2) Po was increased, and 3) sensitivity to potentiation by ±Bay K 8644 was enhanced. Each of these effects indicate that substitution of the α1A III-IV loop for that of α1S promotes transitions of the channel from closed states into open states, which can be accounted for by the hypothesis that the wild-type α1S III-IV loop stabilizes resting states of the DHPR. Because some of the gating transitions of the DHPR that result in activation of L-type current may also be involved in activation of RyR1, it seems reasonable that the α1S III-IV loop might also inhibit depolarization-induced DHPR conformational changes that activate RyR1. This hypothesis would account for the hyperpolarizing shift in Ca2+ release observed for GFP-α1S[III-IVa] if substitution of the α1A III-IV loop removed the inhibitory effect of the wild-type α1S III-IV loop on depolarization-induced DHPR conformational changes. The maximal Po is typically very low (<0.1) for L-type channels containing either α1S (55Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 227-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or α1C (56Cachelin A.B. de Peyer J.E. Kokubun S. Reuter H. Nature. 1983; 304: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) as the principle subunit, but quite high (∼0.5) for P/Q-type channels containing α1A (57Llinas R.R. Sugimori M. Cherksey B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 560: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) or N-type channels containing α1B (58Delcour A.H. Tsien R.W. Science. 1993; 259: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as the principle subunit. Previously, we had shown that a chimera containing α1C sequence for its amino-terminal half and α1A sequence for its carboxyl-terminal half had a maximal Po more like that of α1A than that of α1C (45Wilkens C.M. Grabner M. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The increased Po for GFP-α1S[III-IVa] compared with GFP-α1S (Fig. 4C) now identifies the III-IV loop as an important determinant of Po. Indeed, our results with GFP-α1S[III-IVa] suggest that the III-IV loop has a quite wide-spread influence on channel gating. One important goal of future research will be to determine the mechanism whereby the III-IV loop influences the function of L-type channels. For example, do these effects depend only on the interaction of the III-IV loop with proximal portions of the primary sequence (IIIS6, IVS1), or do they depend on interaction of the loop with more distal portions of the primary sequence? Most likely, the interactions are complex because the α1S R1086H mutant displays a hyperpolarizing shift in activation of Ca2+ release and a depolarizing shift in activation of L-type Ca2+ current (40Weiss R.G. O'Connell K.M.S. Flucher B.E. Allen P.D. Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1094-C1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition to determining the mechanism of III-IV loop effects on L-type channel gating, another important goal for future research will be to determine whether modifying the sequence of the III-IV loop affects gating of N- or P/Q-type channels. It seems possible that the III-IV loop represents a region of hitherto unrecognized importance for the regulation of all the high voltage-activated channels. We thank Drs. N. M. Lorenzon, A. M. Payne, and D. C. Sheridan and J. D. Ohrtman for insightful discussion."

However, it can be trapped on DNA as cleavage complexes (Top1cc) by oxidative and carcinogenic DNA lesions, base damage, and camptothecin treatment. We show here that Top1 is also functionally involved in death receptor-induced programmed cell death. In cells exposed to TRAIL or Fas ligand, Top1cc form at the onset of apoptosis. Those apoptotic Top1cc are prevented by caspase inhibition and Bax inactivation, indicating that both caspases and the mitochondrial death pathway are required for their formation. Accordingly, direct activation of the mitochondrial pathway by BH3 mimetic molecules induces apoptotic Top1cc.

The binding of TRAIL to the DR4 or DR5 receptors and the binding of Fas ligand to Fas receptor cause the intracellular death domains of those receptors to trimerize, which leads to the recruitment of FADD and the activation of caspase-8. Caspase-8 then cleaves and thereby activates caspase-3 either directly (type I cells) or/and indirectly (type II cells) (4Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J.

It relaxes DNA by forming transient DNA single-strand breaks that are produced as Top1 forms a covalent bond between its active site tyrosine (Tyr723) and a 3′-DNA phosphate. These Top1 cleavage complexes (Top1cc) allow controlled rotation of the broken DNA around the intact strand (10Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Immediately after DNA relaxation, Top1 religates the break in the absence of added cofactor, such as ATP. Under normal conditions, the Top1cc are constitutively transient and almost undetectable because the DNA religation (closing) step is much faster than the DNA cleavage (nicking) step. The rapid resealing of Top1cc is inhibited by many common DNA base alterations (oxidation, alkylation, base mismatch, base loss), carcinogenic DNA adducts, and DNA backbone nicks (12Pourquier P.

BH3I-2′ was purchased from Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA), and the caspase peptide inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-dl-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk) was from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Detection of Cellular Topoisomerase Cleavage Complexes—Topoisomerase cleavage complexes were detected using the in vivo complex of enzyme bioassay as described (22Subramanian D. Kraut E. Staubus A. Young D.C. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed in 1% Sarkosyl and homogenized. The cell lysates were centrifuged on cesium chloride step gradients at 165,000 × g for 20 h at 20 °C. Twenty 0.5-ml fractions were collected and diluted (v/v) into 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6. The DNA-containing fractions (fractions 7–11) were pooled (except in Fig. 1A) and applied to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, MA) using a slot blot vacuum manifold. Topoisomerase cleavage complexes were detected by immunoblotting using the C21 Top1 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1,000 dilution) (a kind gift from Dr. Yung-Chi Cheng, Yale University, New Haven, CT) or a Top2α mouse monoclonal antibody (clone Ki-S1, 1:1,000 dilution) from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). To identify the covalent DNA binding of the 80-kDa cleaved form of Top1 (see Fig. 4D, bottom panel), the DNA-containing fractions isolated as described above were precipitated with isopropanol (v/v) following addition of 0.5 m ammonium and a 10-min incubation at -20 °C. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), the pellets (DNA-protein complexes) were washed with 70% ethanol. Following resuspension in 5 mm CaCl2 buffer containing protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science), the DNA was digested with 50 units of DNase I for 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by the addition of loading buffer (v/v) (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 4.6% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.003% bromphenol blue), boiled, and applied to 8% SDS-PAGE gels. Top1 was detected by immunoblotting with the C21 Top1 monoclonal antibody. Western Blotting—Western blotting analyses on whole cell extracts were performed as described (16Sordet O. Khan Q.A. Plo I. Pourquier P. Urasaki Y. Yoshida A. Antony S. Kohlhagen G. Solary E. Saparbaev M. Laval J. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50499-50504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using the C21 Top1 monoclonal antibody (1:1,000 dilution), the poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) polyclonal antibody (1:5,000 dilution) (Roche Applied Science), the γ-H2AX monoclonal antibody (1:2,000 dilution) (Upstate Biotechnology), and the tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:5,000 dilution) (clone Ab-4; NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA). Identification of Apoptosis—Global DNA fragmentation was quantified by filter elution assay as described (23Bertrand R. Kohn K.W. Solary E. Pommier Y. Drug Dev. 1995; 34: 138-144Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and expressed as a percentage of fragmented DNA relative to total DNA. Oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation was visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis using the quick apoptotic ladder kit from Biovision (Mountain View, CA). For sub-G1 analysis, DNA content was assessed by staining ethanol-fixed cells with propidium iodide and monitoring by FACScan (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The number of cells with sub-G1 DNA content was determined with the CellQuest program (BD Biosciences). For electron microscopy, the cells were fixed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2% glutaraldehyde and post-fixed in 1% osmium in same buffer. Then the cells were stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in graded ethanol and propylene oxide, and infiltrated in equal volume of epoxy resin and propylene oxide overnight. The sample was embedded in epoxy resin and cured in 55 °C oven for 48 h. The cured block was thin sectioned and stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined by electron microscopy (Hitachi H700 microscope, Tokyo, Japan). Caspase activities were measured as described (18Sordet O. Goldman A. Pommier Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 3139-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using the fluorogenic peptide substrate Z-DEVD-AFC (caspase-3) and Z-IETD-AFC (caspase-8) from Calbiochem. Confocal Microscopy Analyses of 8-Oxoguanine—After cytospin, Jurkat cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and post-fixed/permeabilized with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 20 min. The cells were incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h to block nonspecific binding before incubation with both mouse anti-8-oxoguanine (clone 483.15; Chemicon International) (1:250 dilution) and rabbit antihuman Top1 antibodies (raised against the 68-kDa C-terminal Top1 fragment; local source) (1:500 dilution) for 1.5 h. After washes, the cells were incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies (Alexa-488 and Alexa-568; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45 min. The slides were mounted using Vectashield mounting liquid (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA), and fluorescences were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse TE-300 confocal laser microscope. Quantification of fluorescence intensity was determined using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software and expressed as relative fluorescence intensity/cell. Top1 Silencing by RNA Interference—Top1 expression was stably down-regulated in HCT116 cells by the transfection of U6 promoter-driven DNA vectors stably expressing small interfering RNA (siRNA) hairpins targeting human Top1 (HCT116siTop1; cDNA sequence: 5′-CTT GAC AGC CAA GGT ATT C-3′) or a negative control sequence (HCT116siCtrl; cDNA sequence, 5′-GCG TCC TTT CCA CAA GAT A-3′) as described (24Miao Z.H. Player A. Shankavaram U. Wang Y.H. Zimonjic D.B. Lorenzi P.L. Liao Z.Y. Liu H. Shimura T. Zhang H.L. Meng L.H. Zhang Y.W. Kawasaki E.S. Popescu N.C. Aladjem M.I. Goldstein D.J. Weinstein J.N. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8752-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For transient down-regulation of Top1 expression, the cells were transfected with an siRNA duplex (Qiagen) against the sequence GGA CTC CAT CAG ATA CTA T from the Top1 mRNA. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A negative control siRNA duplex from Qiagen (target DNA sequence: TTC TCC GAA CGT GTC ACG T) was used. The Top1 knock-down experiments were carried out 72 h after transfection. TRAIL and Fas Induce Apoptotic Top1cc—Trapped Top1cc can be detected in genomic DNA after cesium chloride gradient centrifugation and immunoblotting with Top1 antibody (16Sordet O. Khan Q.A. Plo I. Pourquier P. Urasaki Y. Yoshida A. Antony S. Kohlhagen G. Solary E. Saparbaev M. Laval J. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50499-50504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In human leukemia Jurkat cells exposed to TRAIL or to an agonistic anti-Fas antibody (anti-Fas Ab) that mimics Fas ligand, we detected high levels of Top1cc (Fig. 1A). By contrast, topoisomerase IIα cleavage complexes (Top2αcc) were not detectable under conditions where etoposide (positive control) produced a clear signal (Fig. 1A). Similarly, Top2βcc were not induced by TRAIL (data not shown). Those experiments indicate that the binding of TRAIL and anti-Fas Ab to their plasma membrane receptors DR4/DR5 and Fas, respectively (3Ashkenazi A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar), effectively induce the formation of Top1cc. TRAIL and Fas ligand are potent inducers of apoptosis in tumor cells (1Ashkenazi A. Pai R.C. Fong S. Leung S. Lawrence D.A. Marsters S.A. Blackie C. Chang L. McMurtrey A.E. Hebert A. DeForge L. Koumenis I.L. Lewis D. Harris L. Bussiere J. Koeppen H. Shahrokh Z. Schwall R.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar, 2Walczak H. Miller R.E. Ariail K. Gliniak B. Griffith T.S. Kubin M. Chin W. Jones J. Woodward A. Le T. Smith C. Smolak P. Goodwin R.G. Rauch C.T. Schuh J.C. Lynch D.H. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2236) Google Scholar), suggesting that the observed Top1cc were apoptotic Top1cc resulting from the activation of cell death pathways. In line with this possibility, TRAIL and anti-Fas Ab induced Top1cc with kinetics that coincided with DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1, B and C). Top1cc and apoptotic DNA fragmentation were both detected after 1 h of exposure to TRAIL (or 3 h for anti-Fas Ab). Top1cc persisted throughout the apoptotic process as the DNA became extensively fragmented (Fig. 1, B and C). To demonstrate that those Top1cc were due to apoptosis, we tested whether inhibition of the apoptotic pathways induced by TRAIL and anti-Fas Ab would prevent the formation of Top1cc. Pretreatment of cells with the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk inhibited TRAIL- and anti-Fas Ab-induced apoptosis, as well as the formation of Top1cc (Fig. 1D). As expected, Z-VAD-fmk also inhibited the activities of caspases 8 and 3 and the cleavage of PARP (Fig. 1E). Because the formation of apoptotic Top1cc by UV-C radiation and colcemid was recently reported to involve p53 (17Rockstroh A. Kleinert A. Kramer M. Grosse F. Soe K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we examined Top1cc in p53-/- HCT116 cells exposed to TRAIL. We found that p53+/+ and p53-/- HCT116 cells both displayed similar induction of Top1cc in response to TRAIL (Fig. 1F, bottom panel). Both cell lines also exhibited similar apoptotic response to TRAIL (Fig. 1F, top panel), which further demonstrates that TRAIL-induced apoptosis is p53-independent (25Ravi R. Bedi A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1583-1587PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, our experiments demonstrate a close association between the formation of Top1cc and the induction of p53-independent apoptosis in cells exposed to TRAIL. TRAIL-induced Top1cc Require Activation of the Mitochondrial Death Pathway—In most cancer cells, TRAIL induces apoptosis by increasing the permeability of mitochondrial membranes (3Ashkenazi A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Schematically, the proapoptotic Bax protein induces the formation of mitochondrial pores in the outer membrane by antagonizing the antiapoptotic Bcl-xL protein. Because the loss of Bax has been shown to protect HCT116 cells against TRAIL-induced apoptosis (25Ravi R. Bedi A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1583-1587PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the formation of Top1cc in Bax+/- and Bax-/- HCT116 cells (21Zhang L. Yu J. Park B.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2000; 290: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that Bax-/- cells failed to induce Top1cc (bottom panel). They were also defective in apoptosis (top panel). These experiments demonstrate that Bax plays a key role in TRAIL-induced apoptotic Top1cc. Next, we investigated whether direct activation of the apoptotic mitochondrial pathway (26Grad J.M. Cepero E. Boise L.H. Drug Resist. Updates. 2001; 4: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was sufficient to induce apoptotic Top1cc. Both the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3) mimetics antimycin A (27Tzung S.P. Kim K.M. Basanez G. Giedt C.D. Simon J. Zimmerberg J. Zhang K.Y. Hockenbery D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B) and BH3I-2′ (28Degterev A. Lugovskoy A. Cardone M. Mulley B. Wagner G. Mitchison T. Yuan J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C), which bind to and inhibit Bcl-xL, led to the induction of apoptotic Top1cc. Altogether, our results indicate a pivotal role of the mitochondrial death pathway for the induction of apoptotic Top1cc by TRAIL. TRAIL-induced Apoptotic Top1cc Are Linked to the Generation of Oxidative DNA Lesions—Because Top1cc are readily induced by oxidative base damages (e.g. 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG)), DNA strand breaks, and ROS (12Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 80: 189-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Daroui P. Desai S.D. Li T.K. Liu A.A. Liu L.F. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8516-8523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we searched for the presence of 8-oxoG in TRAIL-treated cells (9Lee M.W. Park S.C. Yang Y.G. Yim S.O. Chae H.S. Bach J.H. Lee H.J. Kim K.Y. Lee W.B. Kim S.S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy (Fig. 3, A and B) showed 8-oxoG nuclear staining in TRAIL-treated cells, indicative of TRAIL-induced oxidative damage (3Ashkenazi A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 31Izeradjene K. Douglas L. Tillman D.M. Delaney A.B. Houghton J.A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7436-7445Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 32Mohr A. Buneker C. Gough R.P. Zwacka R.M. Oncogene. 2007; PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, caspases inhibition by Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1E) prevented TRAIL-induced 8-oxoG (Fig. 3, A and B), which is in agreement with recent studies showing ROS production by caspase activation (33Ricci J.E. Gottlieb R.A. Green D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 34Ricci J.E. MunoZ-Pinedo C. Fitzgerald P. Bailly-Maitre B. Perkins G.A. Yadava N. Scheffler I.E. Ellisman M.H. Green D.R. Cell. 2004; 117: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Our results and these publications suggest that TRAIL-induced caspase activation leads to the generation of oxidative DNA lesions and apoptotic Top1cc. To further demonstrate that TRAIL-induced apoptotic Top1cc were related to oxidative DNA lesions, we tested the effect of the potent antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). Fig. 3 shows that quenching ROS with NAC prevented both TRAIL-induced 8-oxoG (Fig. 3, A and B) and Top1cc (Fig. 3C). Fas-induced apoptosis has also been associated with the intracellular accumulation of ROS (35Shakibaei M. Schulze-Tanzil G. Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 482-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and with the generation of oxidative DNA lesions (36Nathan I. Dizdaroglu M. Bernstein L. Junker U. Lee C. Muegge K. Durum S.K. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Accordingly, NAC prevented the induction of Top1cc by anti-Fas Ab (Fig. 3C). Altogether, our findings indicate that both caspase activation and oxidative DNA damage are involved in the production of apoptotic Top1cc induced by death receptor activation. Caspase-3-cleaved Top1 Is Preferentially Associated with the Apoptotic Top1cc Induced by TRAIL—We next investigated whether modifications of Top1 itself might also contribute to the formation of apoptotic Top1cc induced by TRAIL. The 100-kDa native Top1 protein is indeed a known substrate of caspase-3 (7Samejima K. Svingen P.A. Basi G.S. Kottke T. Mesner Jr., P.W. Stewart L. Durrieu F. Poirier G.G. Alnemri E.S. Champoux J.J. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4335-4340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 cleaves Top1 after aspartate residue 146 and generates an 80-kDa C-terminal fragment (Fig. 4A) that remains capable of forming Top1cc (7Samejima K. Svingen P.A. Basi G.S. Kottke T. Mesner Jr., P.W. Stewart L. Durrieu F. Poirier G.G. Alnemri E.S. Champoux J.J. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41107-41113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B (upper panel) shows that TRAIL induced the appearance of the proteolytic Top1 form (80CL) (7Samejima K. Svingen P.A. Basi G.S. Kottke T. Mesner Jr., P.W. Stewart L. Durrieu F. Poirier G.G. Alnemri E.S. Champoux J.J. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4335-4340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Compared with the other caspase substrate, PARP (Fig. 4C), Top1 cleavage remained incomplete (Fig. 4B, upper panel) (7Samejima K. Svingen P.A. Basi G.S. Kottke T. Mesner Jr., P.W. Stewart L. Durrieu F. Poirier G.G. Alnemri E.S. Champoux J.J. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4335-4340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This partial cleavage of Top1 coincided with the generation of apoptotic Top1cc in response to TRAIL (Fig. 4B, lower panel). We next investigated which of the two forms of Top1, the 100-kDa native Top1 or the 80-kDa caspase-processed Top1, formed the apoptotic Top1cc. To address this question, TRAIL-induced Top1cc were isolated from the DNA-containing cesium chloride fractions. Following DNA digestion with DNase I, Western blotting was performed to determine the molecular mass of the Top1 molecules involved in the TRAIL-induced Top1cc. Approximately 90% of the Top1cc consisted of the truncated 80-kDa Top1 fragment (Fig. 4, D, bottom panel, and E). By contrast, the 80-kDa Top1 form corresponded to only ∼40% of total Top1 in whole cell extracts (Fig. 4, D, top panel, and E). These experiments demonstrate that the apoptotic Top1cc generated during TRAIL-induced apoptosis correspond primarily to the 80-kDa C-terminal fragment of Top1 generated by caspase-3. Functional Relevance of TRAIL-induced Apoptotic Top1cc—First, to determine whether apoptotic Top1cc could directly contribute to the apoptotic DNA fragmentation, we determined the frequency of TRAIL-induced Top1cc. Using CPT as a calibrator (39Goldwasser F. Bae I. Valenti M. Torres K. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2116-2121PubMed Google Scholar), we estimated that TRAIL induced approximately one Top1cc/100 kbp in cells treated with TRAIL for 4 h (Fig. 5). That number scores relatively low compared with the observed DNA double-strand break frequency produced by apoptotic endonucleases (8Samejima K. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, G and H). Thus, it is unlikely that apoptotic Top1cc contribute to the direct breakdown of genomic DNA.FIGURE 6Apoptotic Top1cc are involved in TRAIL-induced apoptotic nuclear modifications. A–C, Top1 was silenced in HCT116 cells using U6 promoter-driven DNA vectors stably expressing siRNA hairpins targeting human Top1 (HCT116siTop1) or a negative control sequence (HCT116siCtrl).
