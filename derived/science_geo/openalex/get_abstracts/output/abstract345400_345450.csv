https://openalex.org/W1998835038,"Rodin and Rodin point out that there are two ways of judging teaching through students—ascertaining how much students have learned and obtaining student evaluations of teacher effectiveness. Some commonly accepted notions regarding student evaluations are challenged in this article, which comments on the results obtained in a number of studies. The authors suggest that “students are less than perfect judges of teaching effectiveness”—at least if teaching effectiveness is measured by how much students learn. This paper, reprinted from Science, helps to set the stage for the remaining articles in this issue."
https://openalex.org/W1993784562,"The secretory matrix of the stylar-transmitting tract of angiosperms has been characterized as a nutrient medium for the growth of pollen tubes, acting to guide tubes to the ovules. When nonliving particles (latex beads) were artificially introduced onto the transmitting tracts of styles of Hemerocallis flava, Raphanus raphanistrum, and Vicia faba, they were translocated to the ovary at rates similar to those of pollen tubes. Direct observations were made on the movement of individual beads along the secretory epidermis in the style and ovary of Vicia faba. The transmitting tract may play an active role in extending tube tips to their destination in the ovary."

This difference is ascribed to the chemical behavior of their respective tetravalent oxides. The ratio of selenium to sulfur in glacial ice is characteristic of terrestrial matter, and these elements may find their way to ice sheets by the formation of volatile compounds in biochemical processes."
https://openalex.org/W1997479249,"The electrostatic energy of the 2M(1) muscovite structure, KAl(2)(Si(3)Al)- O(10)(OH)(2), has been calculated as a function of the orientation of the hydroxyl group (O-H distance = 0.97 angstrom). The minimum in the electrostatic energy occurs when the OH bond makes an angle of 18 degrees with the cleavage plane and an angle of 31 degrees with the b-axis (in the a-b plane), which is 2.5 degrees away from the orientation of the transition moment as determined from infrared measurements on single crystals. If the K+ ion is excluded from the calculation, the O-H bond makes an angle of 53 degrees with the cleavage plane. This indicates the strong influence that the interlayer cation exerts on the hydroxyl hydrogen in mica structures."

https://openalex.org/W2036430667,"A comparison has been made of the interplanetary magnetic field as measured both by Apollo 12 on the lunar surface and by Explorer 35 in orbit around the moon. Two examples are given, one of a step change in the field vector and another of a sinusoidally varying field. A large response measured on the surface is attributed to confinement of the induced field lines between the streaming solar plasma and the high-conductivity interior. A steep bulk electrical conductivity gradient in the lunar crust is implied, with a confining layer roughly 100 kilometers deep."

https://openalex.org/W2019811332,"Coal combustion is the largest single source of sulfur oxide pollution. Treatment of some major representative U.S. coals with aqueous ferric solution removes 40 to 75 percent of the sulfur content through near quantitative oxidation of the pyritic sulfur contained in the coal matrix. Elemental sulfur and iron sulfate are recovered as products of the reaction. Engineering assessment indicates that the system, when fully developed, offers high potential for the economic abatement of sulfur oxide pollution."

https://openalex.org/W2064619814,"Irregular galaxies can be viewed as laboratories for studying the processes of star formation. This class of galaxy, unlike the more familiar spiral galaxies, forms stars without spiral arms and does so from a chemically less-evolved interstellar medium. In this article the problems associated with star formation in irregular galaxies are outlined and their relevance to our understanding of star formation as a general astrophysical process is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1993586924,"Radar echoes from the martian satellite Phobos provide information about that object's surface properties at scales near the 3.5-cm observing wavelength. Phobos appears less rough than the moon at centimeter-to-decimeter scales. The uppermost few decimeters of the satellite's regolith have a mean bulk density within 20% of 2.0 g cm-3. The radar signature of Phobos (albedo, polarization ratio, and echo spectral shape) differs from signatures measured for small, Earth-approaching objects, but resembles those of large (≥100-km), C-class, mainbelt asteroids."

https://openalex.org/W2003136074,"Lunar samples contain mercury, which may be volatilized at lunar daytime temperatures. Such mercury may constitute part of the tenuous lunar atmosphere. If mercury can escape from the atmosphere by a nonthermal mechanism, an interior reservoir or exterior sources (such as meteorite infall or solar wind, or both) are required to replenish it. Core samples exhibit an increase in surface-related mercury with depth, which suggests that a cold trap exists below the surface. The orientation of rocks on the lunar surface may be inferred by differences in the amounts of surface-related mercury found on exterior and interior samples."
