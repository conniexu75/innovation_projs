https://openalex.org/W1561747056,"Platelets metabolize arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2, a potent platelet aggregator and vasoconstrictor compound. The first step of this transformation is catalyzed by prostaglandin (PG) G/H synthase, a target site for nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. We have isolated the cDNA for both human platelet and human erythroleukemia cell PGG/H synthase using the polymerase chain reaction and conventional screening procedures. The cDNA encoding the full-length protein was expressed in COS-M6 cells. Microsomal fractions from transfected cells produced prostaglandin endoperoxide-derived products which were inhibited by indomethacin and aspirin. Mutagenesis of the serine residue at position 529, the putative aspirin acetylation site, to an asparagine reduced cyclooxygenase activity to barely detectable levels, an effect observed previously with the expressed sheep vesicular gland enzyme. Platelet-derived growth factor and phorbol ester differentially regulated the expression of PGG/H synthase mRNA levels in the megakaryocytic/platelet-like HEL cell line. The PGG/H synthase gene was assigned to chromosome 9 by analysis of a human--hamster somatic hybrid DNA panel. The availability of platelet PGG/H synthase cDNA should enhance our understanding of the important structure/function domains of this protein and its gene regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1999751317,"Oogenesis in Drosophila involves specification of both germ cells and the surrounding somatic follicle cells, as well as the determination of oocyte polarity. We found that two neurogenic genes, Notch and Delta, are required in oogenesis. These genes encode membrane proteins with epidermal growth factor repeats and are essential in the decision of an embryonic ectodermal cell to take on the fate of neuroblast or epidermoblast. In oogenesis, mutation in either gene leads to an excess of posterior follicle cells, a cell fate change reminiscent of the hyperplasia of neuroblasts seen in neurogenic mutant embryos. Furthermore, the Notch mutation in somatic cells causes mislocalization of bicoid in the oocyte. These results suggest that the neurogenic genes Notch and Delta are involved in both follicle cell development and the establishment of anterior-posterior polarity in the oocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2086275795,"Association of Fos and Jun with the AP-1 site results in a conformational change in the basic amino acid regions that constitute the DNA-binding domain. We show that Fos and Jun induce a corresponding alteration in the conformation of the DNA helix. Circular permutation analysis indicated that both Fos-Jun heterodimers and Jun homodimers induce flexure at the AP-1 site. Phasing analysis demonstrated that Fos-Jun heterodimers and Jun homodimers induce DNA bends that are directed in opposite orientations. Fos-Jun heterodimers bend DNA toward the major groove, whereas Jun homodimers bend DNA toward the minor groove. Fos and Jun peptides encompassing the dimerization and DNA-binding domains bend DNA in the same orientations as the full-length proteins. However, additional regions of both proteins influence the magnitude of the DNA bend angle. Thus, despite the amino acid sequence similarity in the basic region Fos-Jun heterodimers and Jun homodimers form topologically distinct DNA-protein complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1598171890,"A panel of monoclonal antibodies prepared to the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans of rat brain was used for their immunocytochemical localization and isolation of individual proteoglycan species by immunoaffinity chromatography. One of these proteoglycans (designated 1D1) consists of a major component with an average molecular size of 300 kDa in 7-day brain, containing a 245-kDa core glycoprotein and an average of three 22-kDa chondroitin sulfate chains. A 1D1 proteoglycan of approximately 180 kDa with a 150-kDa core glycoprotein is also present at 7 days, and by 2-3 weeks postnatal this becomes the major species, containing a single 32-kDa chondroitin 4-sulfate chain. The concentration of 1D1 decreases during development, from 20% of the total chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan protein (0.1 mg/g brain) at 7 days postnatal to 6% in adult brain. A 45-kDa protein which is recognized by the 8A4 monoclonal antibody to rat chondrosarcoma link protein copurifies with the 1D1 proteoglycan, which aggregates to a significant extent with hyaluronic acid. A chondroitin/keratan sulfate proteoglycan (designated 3H1) with a size of approximately 500 kDa was isolated from rat brain using monoclonal antibodies to the keratan sulfate chains. The core glycoprotein obtained after treatment of the 3H1 proteoglycan with chondroitinase ABC and endo-beta-galactosidase decreases in size from approximately 360 kDa at 7 days to approximately 280 kDa in adult brain. In 7-day brain, the proteoglycan contains three to five 25-kDa chondroitin 4-sulfate chains and three to six 8.4-kDa keratan sulfate chains, whereas the adult brain proteoglycan contains two to four chondroitin 4-sulfate chains and eight to nine keratan sulfate chains, with an average size of 10 kDa. The concentration of 3H1 increases during development from 3% of the total soluble proteoglycan protein at 7 days to 11% in adult brain, and there is a developmental decrease in the branching and/or sulfation of the keratan sulfate chains. A third monoclonal antibody (3F8) was used to isolate a approximately 500-kDa chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan comprising a 400-kDa core glycoprotein and an average of four 28-kDa chondroitin sulfate chains. In the 1D1 and 3F8 proteoglycans of 7-day brain, 20 and 33%, respectively, of the chondroitin sulfate is 6-sulfated, whereas chondroitin 4-sulfate accounts for greater than 96% of the glycosaminoglycan chains in the adult brain proteoglycans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1518551135,"The anaerobic archaebacterium, Pyrococcus furiosus, grows optimally at 100 degrees C by a fermentative-type metabolism in which H2, CO2, and organic acids are end products. The growth of this organism is stimulated by tungsten, and, from it, a novel, red-colored, tungsten-iron-sulfur protein, abbreviated RTP, has been purified (Mukund, S., and Adams, M. W. W. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 11508-11516). RTP (Mr approximately 85,000) contained approximately 1W, 7Fe, and 5 acid-labile sulfide atoms/molecule and exhibited unique EPR properties. The physiological function of the protein, however, was unknown. We show here that RTP is an inactive form of an aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (AOR). The active enzyme was obtained by rapid purification under anaerobic conditions using buffers containing dithiothreitol and glycerol. AOR catalyzed the oxidation of a range of aliphatic aldehydes with an optimum temperature for activity above 90 degrees C, but it did not oxidize glucose or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, nor reduce NAD(P), and its activity was independent of CoA. The active (AOR) and inactive (RTP) forms of the enzyme were indistinguishable in their contents of metals and acid-labile sulfide and in their EPR properties. The latter are though to originate from two nonidentical and spin-coupled iron-sulfur clusters, whereas the tungsten in this enzyme, which was not detectable by EPR, appears to be present as a novel pterin cofactor. Inhibition and activation studies indicated that AOR contains a catalytically essential W-SH group that is not present in RTP, the inactive form. AOR is a new type of aldehyde-oxidizing enzyme and is the first aldehyde oxidoreductase to be purified from an archaebacterium or a nonactogenic anaerobic bacterium. Its physiological role in P. furiosus is proposed as the oxidation of glyceraldehyde to glycerate in a unique, partially nonphosphorylated, glycolytic pathway that generates acetyl-CoA from glucose without the participation of nicotinamide nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1984223992,"Size-exclusion chromatography and sedimentation equilbrium studies demonstrated that zinc ion (Zn2+) induced the dimerization of human growth hormone (hGH). Scatchard analysis of 65Zn2+ binding to hGH showed that two Zn2+ ions associate per dimer of hGH in a cooperative fashion. Cobalt (II) can substitute for Zn2+ in the hormone dimer and gives a visible spectrum characteristic of cobalt coordinated in a tetrahedral fashion by oxygen- and nitrogen-containing ligands. Replacement of potential Zn2+ ligands (His18, His21, and Glu174) in hGH with alanine weakened both Zn2+ binding and hGH dimer formation. The Zn(2+)-hGH dimer was more stable than monomeric hGH to denaturation in guanidine-HCl. Formation of a Zn(2+)-hGH dimeric complex may be important for storage of hGH in secretory granules."
https://openalex.org/W1498931311,"The structure of a unique focose-branched chondroitin sulfate isolated from the body wall of a sea cucumber was examined in detail. This glycosaminoglycan contains side chain disaccharide units of sulfated fucopyranosyl units linked to approximately one-half of the glucuronic acid moieties through the O-3 position of the acid. The intact polysaccharide is totally resistant to chondroitinase degradation, whereas, after defucosylation, it is partially degraded by the enzyme. However, only after an additional step of desulfation, the chondroitin from sea cucumber is almost totally degraded by chondroitinase AC or ABC. This result, together with the methylation and NMR studies of the native and chemically modified polysaccharide, suggest that besides the fucose branches, the sea cucumber chondroitin sulfate contains sulfate esters at position O-3 of the beta-D-glucuronic acid units. Furthermore, the proteoglycan from the sea cucumber chondroitin sulfate is recognized by anti-Leu-7 monoclonal antibody, which specifically recognizes 3-sulfoglucuronic acid residues. In analogy with the fucose branched units, the 3-O-sulfo-beta-D-glucuronosyl residues are resistant to chondroitinase degradation. Regarding the position of the glycosidic linkage and site of sulfation in the fucose branches, our results suggest high heterogeneity. Tentatively, it is possible to suggest the preponderance of disaccharide units formed by 3,4-di-O-sulfo-alpha-L-fucopyranosyl units glycosidically linked through position 1----2 to 4-O-sulfo-alpha-L-fucopyranose. Finally, the presence of unusual 4/6-disulfated disaccharide units, together with the common 6-sulfated and non-sulfated units, was detected in the chondroitin sulfate core of this polysaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1547016660,"The question of the precise location of mycolic acids, the single most distinctive cell wall entity of members of the Mycobacterium genus, has now been addressed. The free hydroxyl functions of the arabinogalactan component of the mycobacterial cell wall were O-methylated under conditions in which the mycolyl esters were not cleaved. Subsequent replacement of the mycolyl functions with O-ethyl groups resulted in an acid- and base-stable differentially O-alkylated surrogate polysaccharide, more amenable to analysis. Complete hydrolysis, reduction, acetylation, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed the unexpected finding that the mycolyl substituents were selectively and equally distributed on the 5-hydroxyl functions of terminal- and 2-linked arabinofuranosyl (Araf) residues. Further analysis of the O-alkylated cell wall through partial acid hydrolysis, NaB[2H]4 reduction, pentadeuterioethylation, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry demonstrated that the mycolyl units are clustered in groups of four on the previously recognized nonreducing terminal pentaarabinosyl unit [beta-Araf-(1----2)-alpha-Araf)2-3, 5-alpha-Araf. However, only about two-thirds of the available pentasaccharide units are so substituted. Thus, the antigenicity of the arabinan component of mycobacterial cell walls may be explained by the fact that about one-third of the pentaarabinosyl units are not mycolyated and are available for interaction with the immune system. On the other hand, the extreme hydrophobicity and impenetrability of the mycobacterial cell may be explained by the same motif also acting as the fulerum for massive esterified paraffin residues. New fundamental information on the structure of mycobacterial cell walls will aid in our comprehension of its impenetrability to antibiotics and role in immunopathogenesis and persistence of disease."

https://openalex.org/W1575488960,"The protective protein was first discovered because of its deficiency in the metabolic storage disorder galactosialidosis. It associates with lysosomal beta-galactosidase and neuraminidase, toward which it exerts a protective function necessary for their stability and activity. Human and mouse protective proteins are homologous to yeast and plant serine carboxypeptidases. Here, we provide evidence that this protein has enzymatic activity similar to that of lysosomal cathepsin A: 1) overexpression of human and mouse protective proteins in COS-1 cells induces a 3-4-fold increase of cathepsin A-like activity; 2) this activity is reduced to approximately 1% in three galactosialidosis patients with different clinical phenotypes; 3) monospecific antibodies raised against human protective protein precipitate virtually all cathepsin A-like activity in normal human fibroblast extracts. Mutagenesis of the serine and histidine active site residues abolishes the enzymatic activity of the respective mutant protective proteins. These mutants, however, behave as the wild-type protein with regard to intracellular routing, processing, and secretion. In contrast, modification of the very conserved Cys60 residue interferes with the correct folding of the precursor polypeptide and, hence, its intracellular transport and processing. The secreted active site mutant precursors, endocytosed by galactosialidosis fibroblasts, restore beta-galactosidase and neuraminidase activities as effectively as wild-type protective protein. These findings indicate that the catalytic activity and protective function of the protective protein are distinct."
https://openalex.org/W2009153748,"Theories of density-dependent natural selection state that at extreme population densities evolution produces alternative life histories due to trade-offs. The trade-offs are presumed to arise because those genotypes with highest fitness at high population densities will not also have high fitness at low density and vice-versa. These predictions were tested by taking samples from six populations of Drosophila melanogaster kept at low population densities (r-populations) for nearly 200 generations and placing them in crowded cultures (K-populations). After 25 generations in the crowded cultures, the derived K-populations showed growth rate and productivity that at high densities were elevated relative to the controls, but at low density were depressed."
https://openalex.org/W1485525728,"In Rhodobacter sphaeroides, many of the structural genes encoding enzymes of the Calvin cycle are duplicated and grouped within two separate clusters. In this study, the nucleotide sequence of a 5627-base pair region of DNA that contains the form I Calvin cycle gene cluster has been determined. The five open reading frames are arranged in the order, fbpA prkA cfxA rbcL rbcS and are tightly linked and oriented in the same direction. The results of insertional mutagenesis studies suggest the genes are organized within an operon. Consistent with this proposal, the cfxA gene has been tentatively identified as a gene encoding the Calvin cycle enzyme, aldolase. Measurement of the activities of various Calvin cycle enzymes in the insertion mutants showed that inactivation of genes within one CO2 fixation cluster affected expression of genes within the second cluster, revealing a complex regulatory network."
https://openalex.org/W1493515436,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is a key regulatory enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis and is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A fusion protein, HMGal, consisting of the membrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase fused to Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells from the SV40 promoter, was previously constructed and was found to respond to regulatory signals for degradation in a similar fashion to the intact HMG-CoA reductase. Degradation of both HMG-CoA reductase and HMGal in CHO cells was enhanced by addition of mevalonate or low density lipoprotein (LDL). In this report we show that 2 cysteine protease inhibitors, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN) and N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-methioninal (ALLM), completely inhibit the mevalonate- or LDL-accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and HMGal and also block the basal degradation of these enzymes. It has been shown that in vitro these protease inhibitors inhibit the activities of Ca(2+)-dependent neutral proteases as well as lysosomal proteases, including cathepsin L, cathepsin b, and cathepsin D. However, the mevalonate-accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and HMGal is not affected by lysosomotropic agents, suggesting that the site of action of these inhibitor peptides in preventing the degradation is not the cathepsins. In brefeldin A-treated cells, where protein export from the ER is blocked, ALLN is still effective in inhibiting the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and HMGal. These results indicate the involvement of non-lysosomal Ca(2+)-dependent proteases in the basal and the accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and HMGal. Enzymatic assays in vitro and immunoblot analyses have revealed calpain- and calpastatin-like proteins in CHO cells. The activities and the amount of these proteins do not change under conditions of enhanced degradation, indicating that the levels of these proteins are not subject to mevalonate regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1511550220,"Cellular migration typically requires cell surface-associated urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and plasminogen, both of which are present as proenzymes. Because each active enzyme can activate the other zymogen, the mechanism by which the initial proteolytic event of this two-zymogen system occurs is unclear. A mutant of single chain u-PA that could not be cleaved to the more active two-chain u-PA was used to demonstrate that (i) u-PA in its single-chain form exhibits a reactive active site serine, (ii) the enzymatic activity of this molecule is augmented 100-fold upon binding to the u-PA receptor on monocytes as compared with the enzymatic activity of the same number of molecules in the fluid phase, and (iii) the molecule thus bound and active remains in the single-chain form. This is likely an important mechanism for the initiation and control of cell surface-associated fibrinolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1583078163,"We studied the molecular basis of familial Type I hyperlipoproteinemia in two brothers of Turkish descent who had normal plasma apolipoprotein C-II levels and undetectable plasma post-heparin lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity. We cloned the cDNAs of LPL mRNA from adipose tissue biopsies obtained from these individuals by the polymerase chain reaction and directional cloning into M13 vectors. Direct sequencing of pools of greater than 2000 cDNA clones indicates that their LPL mRNA contains two mutations: a missense mutation changing codon 156 from GAU to GGU predicting an Asp156----Gly substitution and a nonsense mutation changing the codon for Ser447 from UCA to UGA, a stop codon, predicting a truncated LPL protein that contains 446 instead of 448 amino acid residues. Both patients were homozygous for both mutations. Analysis of genomic DNAs of the patients and their family members by the polymerase chain reaction, restriction enzyme digestion (the GAT----GGT mutation abolishes a TaqI restriction site), and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization confirms that the patients were homozygous for these mutations at the chromosomal level, and the clinically unaffected parents and sibling were true obligate heterozygotes for both mutations. In order to examine the functional significance of the mutations in this family, we expressed wild type and mutant LPLs in vitro using a eukaryotic expression vector. Five types of LPL proteins were produced in COS cells by transient transfection: (i) wild type LPL, (ii) Asp156----Gly mutant, (iii) Ser447----Ter mutant, (iv) Gly448----Ter mutant, and (v) Asp156----Gly/Ser447----Ter double mutant. Both LPL immunoreactive mass and enzyme activity were determined in the culture media and intracellularly. Immunoreactive LPLs were produced in all cases. The mutant LPLs, Asp156----Gly and Asp156----Gly/Ser447----Ter, were devoid of enzyme activity, indicating that the Asp156----Gly mutation is the underlying defect for the LPL deficiency in the two patients. The two mutant LPLs missing a single residue (Gly448) or a dipeptide (Ser447-Gly448) from its carboxyl terminus had normal enzyme activity. Thus, despite its conservation among all mammalian LPLs examined to date, the carboxyl terminus of LPL is not essential for enzyme activity. We further screened 224 unrelated normal Caucasians for the Ser447----Ter mutation and found 36 individuals who were heterozygous and one individual who was homozygous for this mutation, indicating that it is a sequence polymorphism of no functional significance. Human LPL shows high homology to hepatic triglyceride lipase and pancreatic lipase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1501182944,"Enhanced prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis is a hallmark of inflammation, and interleukin-1 (IL), a proinflammatory cytokine, is a potent stimulus of PG production. We investigated the mechanisms of IL-1 alpha-enhanced PG synthesis in serum-stimulated mesangial cells. The rIL-1-stimulated increase in PGE2 synthesis was dose- and time-dependent and inhibited by both cycloheximide and actinomycin D. Phospholipase (PL) activity was increased 5- to 10-fold in acid extracts of rIL-1-treated cells as measured by arachidonate release from exogenous [14C]arachidonyl-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine. This induced phospholipase activity was Ca(2+)-dependent and inhibited by the PLA2 inhibitors, aristocholic acid, 7,7-dimethyl-5,8-eicosadienoic acid, and p-bromophenacylbromide, but not by the 1,2-diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor RHC 80267. The rIL-1-stimulated PLA2 had an alkaline pH optimum, and phosphatidylethanolamine was preferred over phosphatidylcholine as substrate. The PLA2 activity increased by rIL-1 was inhibited in cells coincubated with cycloheximide and was measurable after 6 h. A sensitive and specific solution hybridization assay demonstrated a coordinate time-dependent induction of non-pancreatic PLA2 mRNA expression which was increased at least 6-fold by 24 h. In whole cells, IL-1 had no effect on basal [3H]arachidonic acid release but vasopressin (1 microM)-stimulated release was potentiated 2- to 3-fold, suggesting that IL-1 may prime cells for increased PG synthesis via increased PLA2 activity. Thus IL-1 directly stimulates, as well as primes cells for, enhanced PG synthesis, in part, by increasing PLA2 activity through new synthesis of a non-pancreatic (Type II) PLA2."
https://openalex.org/W1564906814,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is secreted by several cells that participate in the process of atherogenesis, including arterial wall monocyte-derived macrophages. Macrophages in human and non-human primate lesions have recently been demonstrated to contain PDGF-B chain protein in situ. In developing lesions of atherosclerosis, macrophages take up and metabolize modified lipoproteins, leading to lipid accumulation and foam cell formation. Oxidatively modified low density lipoproteins (LDL) have been implicated in atherogenesis and have been demonstrated in atherosclerotic lesions. The effects of the uptake of various forms of modified LDL on PDGF gene expression, synthesis, and secretion in adherent cultures of human blood monocyte-derived macrophages were examined. LDL oxidized in a cell-free system in the presence of air and copper inhibited the constitutive expression of PDGF-B mRNA and secretion of PDGF in a dose-dependent fashion. Oxidatively modified LDL also attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced PDGF-B mRNA expression. These changes were unrelated to the mechanism of lipid uptake and the degree of lipid loading and were detectable within 2 h of exposure to oxidized LDL. The degree of inhibition of both basal and lipopolysaccharide-induced PDGF-B-chain expression increased with the extent of LDL oxidation. Monocyte-derived macrophages exposed to acetylated LDL or LDL aggregates accumulated more cholesterol than cells treated with oxidized LDL, but PDGF expression was not consistently altered. Thus, uptake of a product or products of LDL oxidation modulates the expression and secretion of one of the principal macrophage-derived growth factors, PDGF. This modulation may influence chemotaxis and mitogenesis of smooth muscle cells locally in the artery wall during atherogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2026482695,"Effects of infections by the ciliate Lambornella clarki on larval populations of its mosquito host Aedes sierrensis were examined in laboratory and field studies. When host populations developed with sufficient food, mortality from parasites was additive and reduced the number of emerging mosquitoes. For food-limited populations, mortality was compensatory or depensatory; emerging adults were as or more abundant with higher average fitness than those from uninfected control populations. When nutrients were scarce, parasitic infections relaxed larval competition and increased per capita food by reducing host abundance. Food limitation altered larval feeding behavior, reducing horizontal transmission and subsequent mortality from parasitism."
https://openalex.org/W1525538055,"Previous studies have shown that tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in blood is cleared by the liver partially through a mannose-specific uptake system. The present study was undertaken to investigate, in a purified system, whether t-PA is recognized by the mannose receptor which is expressed on macrophages and liver sinusoidal cells. The mannose receptor was isolated and purified from bovine alveolar macrophages and migrated as a single protein band at M(r) 175,000 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Ligand blotting revealed that this protein specifically bound t-PA. The t-PA-receptor interaction was further characterized in a binding assay, which showed saturable binding with an apparent dissociation constant of 1 nM. t-PA binding required calcium ions and was negligible in the presence of EDTA or at acid pH. Mannose-albumin was an effective inhibitor, whereas galactose-albumin did not have a significant effect. From a series of monosaccharides tested, D-mannose and L-fucose were the most potent inhibitors, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine was a moderate inhibitor, whereas D-galactose and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine were ineffective. t-PA, deglycosylated by endoglycosidase H, did not interact with the receptor. It is concluded that the mannose receptor specifically binds t-PA, probably through its high mannose-type oligosaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1551213903,"Using beta-galactosidase and luciferase as reporter enzymes, we have previously shown that enzymatic inactivation occurring during a heat shock is concomitant with protein insolubilization (Nguyen, V. T., Morange, M., and Bensaude, O. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 10487-10492). In this paper, we observe that pretreatment of cells with D2O and glycerol, compounds known to stabilize protein structure, leads to a parallel decrease of protein inactivation and insolubilization, suggesting that these two phenomena result most probably from heat-induced protein denaturation. We found that heat shock-promoted inactivation and insolubilization are not irreversible processes, since even in the absence of protein synthesis, beta-galactosidase solubility and luciferase solubility and activity are recovered in vivo after a heat treatment. Cognate heat shock proteins might be involved in this renaturation process."
https://openalex.org/W2153150300,"We show here for the first time that actin, troponin C, Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (AAP), and pro-interleukin 1 beta (pro-IL-1 beta), are substrates of the protease encoded by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type-1. As has been seen in other non-viral protein substrates of the HIV protease, the presence of Glu residues in the P2' position appears to play an important role in substrate recognition. Three of the four bonds cleaved in actin, two of the three in troponin C, and all of the bonds hydrolyzed in AAP and pro-IL-1 beta have a P2' Glu residue. In fact, Glu residues are accommodated in all positions from P4 to P4' surrounding the scissile bond in substrates of the HIV proteases, and as many as 4 adjacent Glu residues were seen in one of the bonds cleaved in AAP. This study of non-viral protein substrates has also revealed unexpected amino acids such as Gly, Arg, and Glu in the scissile bond itself rather than the more conventional hydrophobic amino acids. The HIV-2 protease hydrolyzed actin in a manner similar to that of the HIV-1 enzyme, but its cleavage of troponin C was distinct in that it split a bond adjacent to a triplet of Glu residues in P2, P3, and P4 that was refractory to the HIV-1 enzyme. Documentation of cleavage sites in the several important cellular proteins noted above has extended our understanding of the features in a substrate that are recognized by these multi sub-site proteases of retroviral maturation. Moreover, the present work adds to an accumulating body of evidence which demonstrates that these enzymes can damage crucial structural and regulatory cellular proteins if ever their activity is expressed outside the viral particle itself."
https://openalex.org/W1578630465,"An ecotropic virus was chemically modified in order to determine whether its target cell specificity could be altered. We hypothesized that chemical coupling of galactose residues to a virus might permit specific infection of hepatocytes mediated by asialoglycoprotein receptors unique to these cells. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the fact that: 1) artificial asialoglycoproteins can be created by chemical coupling of lactose to proteins; and 2) viruses that are ecotropic have a narrow species specificity. An ecotropic, rodent-specific, replication-defective murine leukemia virus containing the gene for beta-galactosidase was chemically modified with lactose to contain 5.9 mumol of lactose per mg of viral RNA. Modified and unmodified viruses were incubated for 5 days with HepG2, a human hepatoma line that possesses asialoglycoprotein receptors, and SK Hep1, a human cell line that does not. As expected from the ecotropism, unmodified virus did not produce beta-galactosidase activity in either cell type. Modified virus did not produce beta-galactosidase activity in SK Hep1 cells. However, modified virus did produce beta-galactosidase activity, 71.2 units/mg of cell protein, in the human receptor (+) HepG2 cells. Interestingly, modification of the virus also resulted in decreased enzyme activity in previously susceptible host rodent cells. Competition with modified virus by an excess of an asialoglycoprotein completely prevented development of enzymatic activity in HepG2 cells. Histochemical treatment of cells with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl beta-D-galactoside to detect in situ beta-galactosidase activity demonstrated that only HepG2 cells treated with modified virus were positive and that 36% of these cells were stained after 5 days. These data indicate that chemical modification of a virus can result in a redirection of the infectivity of the virus toward hepatocyte-derived cells mediated by the presence of asialoglycoprotein receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1534292959,"Activation of the membrane-associated NADPH oxidase in intact human neutrophils requires a receptor-associated heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein that is sensitive to pertussis toxin. Activation of this NADPH oxidase by arachidonate in a cell-free system requires an additional downstream pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein (Gabig, T. G., English, D., Akard, L. P., and Schell, M. J. (1987) (J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1685-1690) that is located in the cytosolic fraction of unstimulated cells (Gabig, T. G., Eklund, E. A., Potter, G. B., and Dykes, J. R. (1990) J. Immunol. 145, 945-951). In the present study, immunodepletion of G proteins from the cytosolic fraction of unstimulated neutrophils resulted in a loss of the ability to activate NADPH oxidase in the membrane fraction. The activity in immunodepleted cytosol was fully reconstituted by a partially purified fraction from neutrophil cytosol that contained a 21-kDa GTP-binding protein. Purified human recombinant Krev-1 p21 also completely reconstituted immunodepleted cytosol whereas recombinant human H-ras p21 or yeast RAS GTP-binding proteins had no reconstitutive activity. Rabbit antisera raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the effector region of Krev-1 (amino acids 31-43) completely inhibited cell-free NADPH oxidase activation, and this inhibition was blocked by the synthetic 31-43 peptide. An inhibitory monoclonal antibody specific for ras p21 amino acids 60-77 (Y13-259) had no effect on cell-free NADPH oxidase activation. Activation of the NADPH oxidase in intact neutrophils by stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate caused a marked increase in the amount of membrane-associated antigen recognized by 151 antiserum on Western blot. Thus a G protein in the cytosol of unstimulated neutrophils antigenically and functionally related to Krev-1 may be the downstream effector G protein for NADPH oxidase activation.

Some of the defects leading to low levels of HDL may be a consequence of mutations in the genes coding for HDL apolipoproteins A-I and A-II or for enzymes that modify these particles. A proband with plasma apoA-I and HDL cholesterol that are below 15% of normal levels and with marked bilateral arcus senilis was shown to be heterozygous for a 45-base pair deletion in exon four of the apoA-I gene. This most likely represents a de novo mutation since neither parent carries the mutant allele. The protein product of this allele is predicted to be missing 15 (Glu146-Arg160) of the 22 amino acids comprising the third amphipathic helical domain. The HDL of the proband and his family were studied. Using anti-A-I and anti-A-II immunosorbents we found three populations of HDL particles in the proband. One contained both apoA-I and A-II, Lp(A-I w A-II); one contained apoA-I but no A-II, Lp(A-I w/o A-II); and the third (an unusual one) contained apoA-II but no A-I. Only Lp(A-I w A-II) and (A-I w/o A-II) were present in the plasma of the proband's parents and brother. Analysis of the HDL particles of the proband by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed two protein bands with a molecular mass differing by 6% in the vicinity of 28 kDa whereas the HDL particles of the family members exhibited only a single apoA-I band. The largely dominant effect of this mutant allele (designated apoA-ISeattle) on HDL levels suggests that HDL particles containing any number of mutant apoA-I polypeptides are catabolized rapidly."
https://openalex.org/W1501191267,"The synthesis of a variety of proteins, including the well characterized degradative enzymes, which occurs during the transition state between vegetative growth and the onset of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis is controlled by a class of molecules known as transition state regulators. One of these regulators is the product of the hpr gene, first identified by mutations affecting the synthesis of extracellular proteases. We have purified the Hpr protein and found that it binds specifically to DNA fragments carrying the promoters and the upstream regions of the alkaline (aprE) and neutral (nprE) protease genes of B. subtilis. DNase I protection experiments revealed that the Hpr protein is able to bind at four and two regions of the aprE and nprE promoters, respectively. We have also located two Hpr binding sites in the promoter region of a gene of unknown function which is nevertheless known to be developmentally regulated during the transition state and which occurs in the same operon as the gene encoding another transition state regulator, Sin. The location of one of the Hpr binding sites on the aprE gene occurs adjacent to a region to which the Sin protein binds. However, in mixing competition experiments we have shown that Hpr and Sin binding occurred independently, and no visible alterations of protected regions were detected."
https://openalex.org/W2002828151,"THE first step in infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the specific binding of gp!20, the envelope glycoprotein of HIV, to its cellular receptor, CD4 (see ref. 1 for review). To inhibit this interaction, soluble CD4 analogues that compete for gp120 binding and block HIV infection in vitro have been developed2–8. To determine whether these analogues can protect an uninfected individual from challenge with HIV, we used the chimpanzee model system of cell-free HIV infection. Chimpanzees are readily infected with the IIIB strain of HIV-1, becoming viraemic within about 4–6 weeks of challenge, although they do not develop the profound CD4+ T-cell depletion and immunodeficiency characteristic of HIV infection in humans9. CD4 immunoadhesin (CD4–IgG), a chimaeric molecule consisting of the N-terminal two immunoglobulin-like regions of CD4 joined to the Fc region of human IgG1 (refs 8, 10), was selected as the CD4 analogue for testing because it has a longer half-life than CD4, contributed by the IgG Fc portion of the molecule. In humans, this difference results in a 25-fold increased concentration of CD4–IgG in the blood compared with recombinant CD4 (ref. 11). Here we report that pretreatment with CD4–IgG can prevent the infection of chimpanzees with HIV-1. The need for a preventative agent is particularly acute in perinatal HIV transmission. As recombinant CD4–IgG, like the parent IgG molecule, efficiently crosses the primate placenta10, it may be possible to set up an immune state in a fetus before HIV transfer occurs, thus preventing infection."

(1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8297-8303). In the current study, two forms (37A and 37B) of the 37-kDa protein were separated by ion-exchange chromatography after removal of keratan sulfate with endo-beta-galactosidase. Keratan sulfate linkage sites in core proteins were labeled with UDP-[3H]galactose using galactosyltransferase. Labeled proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by tryptic digestion and reversed-phase chromatography. The 37A protein has three keratan sulfate-linkage sites, and the 37B and 25-kDa proteins each contain one linkage site. Reversed-phase tryptic maps of the three proteins differed in total peptide profile and in glycosylated peptides labeled with periodate-[3H]-NaBH4. Tryptic mapping of the two 37-kDa isoforms after deglycosylation showed differences in total tryptic peptides, in peptides labeled with [14C]iodoacetic acid, and in peptides recognized by antibodies to a mixture of the 37-kDa cores. Antibody to a synthetic peptide with N-terminal sequence obtained from mixed 37-kDa cores reacted exclusively with the 37B isoform. These results show that bovine corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycan has three different core proteins each with distinct glycosylation and unique primary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1589434996,"Kinetic parameters of the selenium-containing, formate dehydrogenase component of the Escherichia coli formate-hydrogenlyase complex have been determined with purified enzyme. A ping-pong Bi Bi kinetic mechanism was observed. The Km for formate is 26 mM, and the Km for the electron-accepting dye, benzyl viologen, is in the range 1-5 mM. The maximal turnover rate for the formate-dependent catalysis of benzyl viologen reduction was calculated to be 1.7 x 10(5) min-1. Isotope exchange analysis showed that the enzyme catalyzes carbon exchange between carbon dioxide and formate in the absence of other electron acceptors, confirming the ping-pong reaction mechanism. Dissociation constants for formate (12.2 mM) and CO2 (8.3 mM) were derived from analysis of the isotope exchange data. The enzyme catalyzes oxidation of the alternative substrate deuterioformate with little change in the Vmax, but the Km for deuterioformate is approximately three times that of protioformate. This implies formate oxidation is not rate-limiting in the overall coupled reaction of formate oxidation and benzyl viologen reduction. The deuterium isotope effect on Vmax/Km was observed to be approximately 4.2-4.5. Sodium nitrate was found to inhibit enzyme activity in a competitive manner with respect to formate, with a Ki of 7.1 mM. Sodium azide is a noncompetitive inhibitor with a Ki of about 80 microM."

This study examined what effect GPIIb-IIIa receptor occupancy had on the cytoskeleton of resting and activated platelets. Triton X-100-insoluble residues (cytoskeletons) were isolated from resting washed platelets incubated with either 500 microM RGDS or 500 microM RGES and examined for protein content. RGDS did not increase the amount of GPIIb-IIIa associated with the cytoskeletal residues which sedimented at either 15,800 x g or 100,000 x g. To determine the effect of receptor occupancy on the formation of the activated platelet cytoskeleton, stirred and nonstirred RGDS-treated platelets in plasma were activated with ADP. Triton X-100-insoluble residues were isolated and examined for both protein content and retention of GPIIb-IIIa. Further, morphological studies were performed on the RGDS-ADP-stimulated platelets. The results of this study suggest that 1) RGDS peptide receptor occupancy does not lead to GPIIb-IIIa linkage to the cytoskeleton, 2) ADP-stimulated platelet shape change, polymerization of actin, and association of myosin with the cytoskeleton are unaffected by RGDS peptide receptor occupancy. 3) RGDS inhibits an aggregation-dependent incorporation of ABP, alpha-actinin, talin, and GPIIb-IIIa into the Triton-insoluble residue."
https://openalex.org/W1513857523,"The GTPase activity of a G protein alpha subunit functions as a timer to control the lifetime of the activated conformation of the protein. Expression of the GTPase-deficient Gi2 alpha subunit oncogene, gip2 (alpha i2Q205L), in Chinese hamster ovary cells inhibited the stimulation of adenylylcyclase and altered the calcium regulation of the Gi2-phospholipase A2 (PLA2) effector complex. The phenotypic consequence of the activated alpha i2 mutant on hormonal stimulation of PLA2 varied depending on the cytoplasmic calcium transient elicited by different Gi2-linked receptors. The stimulation of PLA2 by thrombin, which mobilized calcium only from internal stores, was markedly attenuated in gip2-expressing cells. In contrast, the attenuation of the PLA2 response to ATP, a purinergic agonist which mobilizes calcium from both extracellular space and internal stores, was significantly less than that observed for thrombin. Ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, stimulated PLA2 activity in clones which expressed gip2 to a level similar to that observed in wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells. Thus, the dominant GTPase-deficient gip2 polypeptide will constitutively inhibit adenylylcyclase but differentially modulate enzymes regulated by calcium and coupled to Gi2."

The purified protein was an active iron-containing tetrameric SOD with specific activity similar to known manganese-containing SODs (MnSODs) of aerobic archaebacteria. Although M. thermoautotrophicum SOD is an iron-containing SOD (FeSOD), it resembles MnSODs in amino acid sequence as judged by criteria distinguishing FeSODs from MnSODs. Moreover, M. thermoautotrophicum SOD is resistant to azide and hydrogen peroxide as MnSODs are, suggesting that its evolution is distinct from known eubacterial FeSODs."
https://openalex.org/W1593513931,"The Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-binding domain of GPIIb-IIIa has been localized in a fragment of the GPIIIa subunit that includes the sequence between amino acids 109 and 171. To examine, in a platelet membrane environment, the activated versus nonactivated status of this domain, we have produced a monoclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide (residues 109-128) located within the RGD-binding region on GPIIIa. This kappa-IgM, named AC7, was specific for GPIIIa peptide 109-128 and interacted only with activated platelets. Fibrinogen, RGDF peptide, and the fibrinogen phi chain decapeptide LGGAKQAGDV inhibited the binding of AC7 to ADP-stimulated platelets. AC7 IgM and small fragments inhibited fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent fashion. Induction of AC7 binding by D33C, a monoclonal antibody recognizing the GPIIb 426-437 sequence and stimulating fibrinogen binding, indicated that the GPIIb 426-437 and the GPIIIa 109-128 sequences were both involved in a stimulation-dependent conformational modification of the receptor. AC7 was able to recognize beta subunits other than GPIIIa on leucocyte surfaces but only after cell fixation with glutaraldehyde. The results are consistent with the implication of the RGD-binding domain in receptor ligand interaction on the platelet surface and its conformational modification and exposure upon receptor induction."
https://openalex.org/W1525386431,"Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) have been identified as preferred target cells for Escherichia coli hemolysin in human blood (Bhakdi, S., Greulich, S., Muhly, M., Eberspacher, B., Becker, H., Thiele, A., and Hugo, F. (1989) J. Exp. Med. 169, 737-754). Leukotriene and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid generation was investigated in human PMN challenged with E. coli hemolysin in the absence or presence of free arachidonic acid or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). In the absence of exogenous free fatty acids, E. coli hemolysin (0.01-10 hemolytic units/ml) induced moderate generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and its omega-oxidation products. The presence of free arachidonic acid (10 microM) during E. coli hemolysin (0.1 hemolytic unit/ml) challenge evoked the generation of large quantities of these products (greater than 100 pmol/1.5 x 10(7) PMN). In parallel, large amounts of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and nonenzymatic LTA4 hydrolysis products appeared. Product release peaked or plateaued 5-10 min after E. coli hemolysin challenge. The presence of exogenous EPA upon E. coli hemolysin challenge resulted in the exclusive generation of LTB5 and metabolites, LTA5 decay products and 5-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid. Dose and time dependences corresponded to those with arachidonic acid provision, and the total of EPA-derived products surpassed that of arachidonic acid metabolites in corresponding experiments approximately 2-fold. Increasing the time between free fatty acid provision and E. coli hemolysin challenge resulted in a rapid decline in the generation of arachidonic acid or EPA metabolites. Thus, subhemolytic doses of E. coli hemolysin evoke marked PMN eicosanoid generation that is dependent on exogenous free fatty acid supply, with total amounts approximating those found in calcium ionophore-stimulated neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1529683557,"The melting of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) has been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy. At neutral pH, rtPA melts with only partial reversibility in a single sharp peak that can be deconvoluted into four transitions. By contrast, at acidic pH the melting process is spread over a broad range of temperature and is highly reversible. Under these conditions five transitions are resolved by deconvolution analysis. Additional measurements in 6 M guanidinium chloride reveal a sixth transition representing an extremely stable domain. Comparison of the melting curves of several fragments with those of the parent protein allowed all of the transitions to be assigned. The results indicate that rtPA is comprised of six independently folded domains. Two of these domains correspond to the two kringle modules whose thermodynamic properties are similar to those of the kringles in plasminogen. Two additional domains are formed by the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like and finger modules, the latter of which is extremely stable, requiring the presence of a chemical denaturant for its melting to be observed. The serine protease module contains two more domains which at neutral pH melt cooperatively in a single transition but at low pH melt independently, accounting for the greater number of transitions observed there. Measurements with a 50-kDa fragment lacking the C-terminal half of the serine protease module and with a variant lacking the finger and EGF domains indicate that the serine protease domains interact strongly with and are stabilized by the finger and/or EGF domains in the intact protein. This interaction between domains located at opposite ends of the rtPA molecule produces a more compact structure. A better understanding of such interactions may enhance efforts to engineer plasminogen activators with improved thrombolytic properties."

Following the rapid release of Ca2+ by (1,4,5)IP3, Ca2+ was resequestered. The sequential addition of submaximal concentrations of (1,4,5)IP3 resulted in sequential Ca2+ release. However, when the cells were challenged with the poorly metabolized (1,4,5)IP3 analogues, (1,4,5)IPS3 or (2,4,5)IP3, or under conditions where the metabolism of authentic (1,4,5)IP3 was reduced, Ca2+ reuptake again occurred, but sequestered Ca2+ was not released by subsequent additions of (1,4,5)IP3. The sequestered Ca2+ was, however, released by thapsigargin, an agent which inhibits active Ca2+ uptake into the (1,4,5)IP3-sensitive pool. Furthermore, the rate of thapsigargin-induced release was significantly increased in the continued presence of an (1,4,5)IP3 stimulus. Thus, Ca2+ reuptake apparently occurred into the (1,4,5)IP3- and thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ store and (1,4,5)IP3 continued to influence the permeability of this pool to Ca2+ during Ca2+ reuptake. In contrast to the findings in permeabilized cells, Ca2+ reuptake did not occur in the sustained presence of (1,4,5)IP3 in intact parotid cells. We conclude that cell permeabilization reveals a kinetic, and presumably structural, separation of Ca2+ uptake and release sites within the (1,4,5)IP3-regulated intracellular organelle."

K-K., Clarke, S., Gelb, M. H., and Glomset, J. A. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 5866-5872). A biotinylated peptide acceptor comprising the eight carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the gamma subunit and tritiated geranylgeranyl diphosphate were utilized to monitor a protein:prenyl transferase activity in rat organs of varying age. The transferase activity was dependent upon the presence of divalent metal ions and maximal activity was achieved with either 1 mM ZnCl2 or 20 mM MgCl2. Activity was shown to be linear with respect to time, protein concentration, substrate concentration, and the pH optimum was 7.5. Protein:geranylgeranyl transferase activity was detected in all rat organs studied with the highest specific activity in brain S100. No activity was detected in the membrane fraction. The specific activity in brain, liver, kidney, and heart increased with age. Radioactivity incorporated into the peptide acceptor from both [1-3H]geranylgeranyl diphosphate and [5-3H]mevalonate by 21-day-old rat brain S100 was released by treatment with methyl iodide, and in both cases, analysis of the cleavage products by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography showed a peak of radioactivity co-eluting with a geranylgeraniol standard which was well resolved from a farnesol standard. This indicated that the rat brain S100 contained not only the protein:geranylgeranyl transferase but also geranylgeranyl synthetase activity and that the peptide acceptor was specific for geranylgeranyl under the conditions tested."
https://openalex.org/W1645946769,"Oxidation of reduced p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase by oxygen in the presence of 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate and azide proceeds via three well established intermediates. Reconstitution of the apoprotein with either 8-thiophenyl-FAD, 8-fluoro-FAD, 8-chloro-FAD, or 8-sulfonyl-FAD does not alter this sequence of events. However, the peak positions of the intermediate spectra are somewhat shifted relative to those of native enzyme. Comparison of the spectra for intermediates II and III leads to the conclusion that the spectrum for intermediate II is a composite. One component is the spectrum of an intermediate III-like species, and the other appears to be related to the substrate. The substrate component is pH-dependent, having an absorbance maximum of 386 nm (extinction, approximately 6,000 M-1 cm-1) at pH 6.6 which shifts to approximately 430 nm (extinction, approximately 11-13,000 M-1 cm-1) at pH 9.2, with a pK of 7.9. The pH dependence for the spectrum of the substrate component combined with the pH independence of the intermediate III-like spectrum satisfactorily accounts for the pH dependence observed for intermediate II, including the fact that the high pH spectrum of native intermediate II is qualitatively quite different from that of 8-sulfonyl-FAD intermediate II."

Thus, the Na(+)-Na+ and Ca(2+)-Ca2+ exchange reactions reflect reversible partial reactions of the transport cycle. The effect of diffusion potentials (K(+)-valinomycin) on different modes of the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger (Na(+)-Ca2+, Ca(2+)-Ca2+, and Na(+)-Na+ exchanges) were tested in reconstituted proteoliposomes, obtained from the Triton X-100 extracts of the cardiac sarcolemmal membranes. The initial rates of the Nai-dependent 45Ca-uptake (t = 1 s) were measured in EGTA-entrapped proteoliposomes at different voltages. At the fixed values of voltage [45 Ca]o was varied from 4 to 122 microM, and [Na]i was saturating (150 mM). Upon varying delta psi from -94 to +91 mV, the Vmax values were increased from 9.5 +/- 0.5 to 26.5 +/- 1.5 nmol.mg-1.s-1 and the Km from 17.8 +/- 2.5 to 39.1 +/- 5.2 microM, while the Vmax/Km values ranged from only 0.53 +/- 0.08 to 0.73 +/- 0.17 nmol.mg-1.s-1.microM-1. The equilibrium Ca(2+)-Ca2+ exchange was voltage sensitive at very low [Ca]o = [Ca]i = 2 microM, while at saturating [Ca]o = [Ca]i = 200 microM the Ca(2+)-Ca2+ exchange became voltage-insensitive. The rates of the equilibrium Na(+)-Na+ exchange appears to be voltage insensitive at saturating [Na]o = [Na]i = 160 mM. Under the saturating ionic conditions, the rates of the Na(+)-Na+ exchange were at least 2-3-fold slower than the Ca(2+)-Ca2+ exchange. The following conclusions can be drawn. (a) The near constancy of the Vmax/Km for Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange at different voltages is compatible with the ping-pong model proposed previously. (b) The effects of voltage on Vmax of Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange are consistent with the existence of a single charge carrying transport step. (c) It is not yet possible to clearly assign this step to the Na+ or Ca2+ transport half of the cycle although it is more likely that 3Na(+)-transport is a charge carrying step. Thus, the unloaded ion-binding domain contains either -2 or -3 charges (presumably carboxyl groups). (d) The binding of Na+ and Ca2+ appears to be weakly voltage-sensitive. The Ca(2+)-binding site may form a small ion-well (less than 2-3 A)."

Two recombinant vectors were prepared, one containing the sequence corresponding to the mature enzyme and another including, in addition, the sequence of the transit peptide that directs FNR to the chloroplast. These proteins were expressed as fusion products to the NH2-terminal portion of beta-galactosidase. In both cases, a 35-kDa immunoreactive polypeptide was the major product, suggesting that the proteins were processed in vivo. NH2-terminal sequence determination of the purified recombinant proteins indicate cleavage at positions -1/-2 with respect to the normal processing site in chloroplasts. The processed enzymes showed enzymatic activities and spectral properties that were similar or identical to those of native plant FNR. When a La protease-deficient E. coli strain was used as a host, the expressed FNR precursor was found to be poorly processed, associated to bacterial pellets, and showed no detectable FNR activity. The overall results indicate that acquisition of the native enzyme conformation and assembly of the prosthetic group takes place in the bacterial host, generating an enzyme that is, as far as studied, indistinguishable from plant FNR."

Both S-methylglutathione and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene protect the enzyme from inactivation. Analysis of the reactive SH group-containing peptide gives the sequence Ala-Ser-Cys-Leu-Tyr, identical with that of the peptide that contains the reactive cysteine 47 of the human placental transferase. In the presence of glutathione, the enzyme is not inactivated by this reagent, but it catalyzes its conjugation to glutathione.

https://openalex.org/W1567708708,"Previous biosynthetic studies of the ascites 13762 rat mammary adenocarcinoma cell surface sialomucin ASGP-1 (ascites sialoglycoprotein-1) showed that it is synthesized initially as a poorly glycosylated immature form, which is converted to a larger premature form (t1/2 30 min) and more slowly to the mature glycoprotein (t1/2 greater than 4 h). In the present study O-glycosylation of ASGP-1 polypeptide is shown to occur in two phases: an early phase complete in less than 30 min, which corresponds to the synthesis of the premature form, and a later phase that continues for hours and corresponds to the synthesis of the mature form. Pulse-chase labeling studies indicate that 95% of the ASGP-1 has moved to the cell surface in 2 h. Since transit to the cell surface is faster than the slow phase of addition of new oligosaccharides, some new oligosaccharides must be added after ASGP-1 has reached the cell surface. Initiation of new oligosaccharides on cell surface ASGP-1 was demonstrated directly using a biotinylation procedure to identify cell surface molecules. Glucosamine labeling of biotinylated ASGP-1 was shown to occur on galactosamine residues, which are linked to the polypeptide, establishing the addition of new oligosaccharides to the cell surface molecules. Finally, resialylation studies indicate that ASGP-1 rapidly recycles through a sialylating compartment. From these results we propose that ASGP-1 reaches the cell surface in an incompletely glycosylated state and that additional oligosaccharides are added to the glycoprotein in a second process involving recycling."
https://openalex.org/W1517670183,"Abstract A protein that binds to and precipitates with pneumococcal C-polysaccharide and a phosphocholine (PC) derivative of bovine serum albumin has been affinity purified from Limulus amebocytes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis reveals that the isolated protein consists of a single polypeptide chain of approximately 50 kDa. It is an intracellular protein localized in the secretory granules of amebocytes according to immunogold staining. Although it shares the PC-binding property with C-reactive protein isolated from Limulus and other animal species, it differs from C-reactive protein in that the latter binds to PC only in the presence of Ca2+, whereas the newly isolated protein binds to PC in a Ca(2+)-independent manner. In this respect, the newly isolated PC-binding protein resembles the antibodies to PC of mouse myelomas. The gene coding for this protein has been isolated. The gene sequence predicts a protein of 54 kDa with an unusual structural feature: it consists almost entirely of 10 contiguous segments, 45 amino acids in length, with extensive homology. Some limited sequence homologies were found between the 54-kDa protein and segments of vitronectin, gelatinase, and collagenase. It binds to bacterial cells, fixed amebocytes, and a number of extracellular matrix molecules. Due to its structural and some functional similarities to other adhesion molecules, the Limulus 54-kDa protein was named Limunectin."
https://openalex.org/W1570473134,"The properties of the newly synthesized and partially glycosylated forms of the transferrin receptor were examined to determine which co- and post-translational modifications are necessary for the acquisition of transferrin binding activity and transport of the receptor to the cell surface. The nascent transferrin receptor containing core-glycosylated asparagine-linked oligosaccharides does not possess complete intersubunit disulfide bonds, sediments predominantly as a monomer in sucrose density gradients, and shows reduced binding to transferrin-agarose. Within 20-30 min after synthesis, the transferrin receptor acquires the ability to bind to a transferrin-linked affinity column. Intersubunit disulfide bond formation occurs slowly throughout the transit of the receptor to the cell surface. These results indicate that core glycosylation of the receptor may be necessary but is not sufficient for the acquisition of the ability of the receptor to bind transferrin and that intersubunit disulfide bond formation is a post-translational event. Inhibition of complex carbohydrate synthesis by either swainsonine (1 micrograms/ml) or deoxynojirimycin (4 mM) does not inhibit the ability of this receptor to form intersubunit disulfide bonds or to be transported to the cell surface. The partially glycosylated receptor, however, does show an approximately 3-fold reduced affinity for transferrin."

The maximum velocity (Vmax) was about half that of the wild-type enzyme, and the Km value was about double. Absorption and circular dichroism spectra of the fragmentary enzyme were similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. An attempt was made to separately express in Escherichia coli a single polypeptide corresponding to each domain, but no protein reactive with the antibody against the wild-type alanine racemase was produced. Therefore, it is suggested that the two polypeptide fragments can fold into an active structure only when they are co-translated and that they correspond to structural folding units in the parental polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1579045514,"Abstract Random mutagenesis of malate dehydrogenase from a thermophilic bacterium, Thermus flavus AT-62, had revealed that a Thr190----Ile replacement near the essential catalytic residue His187 caused marked modulation of the catalytic properties. For further exploration of a role of the residue at this position, this residue was substituted with each of the other amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis. Most of the mutations except for substitution with Ser caused increases in Km for oxaloacetate and increases Ki for oxaloacetate of 2-110 times. Substitution with His or Pro was characterized by the complete loss of substrate inhibition, along with a marked increase in Km for oxaloacetate. Kinetic analyses of the native and altered malate dehydrogenases at various pHs revealed that both Km and Ki for oxaloacetate decreased proportionally to the decrease in pH from 8.40 to 5.75, whereas kcat was nearly constant within the pH range. Apparent shifts of the optimum pH values toward acidity observed with most of the altered malate dehydrogenases were attributed to the increase in Ki, which facilitated the release from the substrate inhibition at a lower pH. Replacement of Thr310, a possible counterpart with which Thr190 forms a hydrogen bond, by Ile caused changes in the catalytic properties similar to those of the Thr190-substituted enzymes. These results suggest that not only the loss of the hydrogen bond between Thr190 and Thr310 but also properties of the residues introduced at position 190 cause modulation of the catalytic properties, probably through dislocation of the loop structure that contains the catalytic residue His187."
