https://openalex.org/W2017985723,"Viruses have evolved many distinct strategies to avoid the host's apoptotic response1,2. Here we describe a new family of viral inhibitors (v-FLIPs) which interfere with apoptosis signalled through death receptors3 and which are present in several γ-herpesviruses (including Kaposi's-sarcoma-associated human herpesvirus-8), as well as in the tumorigenic human molluscipoxvirus4. v-FLIPs contain two death-effector domains which interact with the adaptor protein FADD5,6, and this inhibits the recruitment and activation of the protease FLICE7,8 by the CD95 death receptor3. Cells expressing v-FLIPs are protected against apoptosis induced by CD95 or by the related death receptors TRAMP9–12 and TRAIL-R. The herpesvirus saimiri FLIP is detected late during the lytic viral replication cycle, at a time when host cells are partially protected from CD95-ligand-mediated apoptosis. Protection of virus-infected cells against death-receptor-induced apoptosis may lead to higher virus production and contribute to the persistence and oncogenicity13 of several FLIP-encoding viruses."

The orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 was shown to be expressed in developing dopamine neurons before the appearance of known phenotypic markers for these cells. Mice lacking Nurr1 failed to generate midbrain dopaminergic neurons, were hypoactive, and died soon after birth. Nurr1 expression continued into adulthood, and brains of heterozygous animals, otherwise apparently healthy, contained reduced dopamine levels. These results suggest that putative Nurr1 ligands may be useful for treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other disorders of midbrain dopamine circuitry."

https://openalex.org/W2068117230,"The use of molecular phylogenies to examine evolutionary questions has become commonplace with the automation of DNA sequencing and the availability of efficient computer programs to perform phylogenetic analyses. The application of computer simulation and likelihood ratio tests to evolutionary hypotheses represents a recent methodological development in this field. Likelihood ratio tests have enabled biologists to address many questions in evolutionary biology that have been difficult to resolve in the past, such as whether host-parasite systems are cospeciating and whether models of DNA substitution adequately explain observed sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2079115522,"Pelagic cherts of Japan and British Columbia, Canada, recorded a long-term and worldwide deep-sea anoxic (oxygen-depleted) event across the Permo-Triassic (or Paleozoic and Mesozoic) boundary (251 ± 2 million years ago). The symmetry in lithostratigraphy and redox condition of the boundary sections suggest that the superocean Panthalassa became totally stratified for nearly 20 million years across the boundary. The timing of onset, climax, and termination of the oceanic stratification correspond to global biotic events including the end-Guadalupian decline, the end-Permian extinction, and mid-Triassic recovery."
https://openalex.org/W1979804898,"In experiments modeling the reactions of the reductive acetyl–coenzyme A pathway at hydrothermal temperatures, it was found that an aqueous slurry of coprecipitated NiS and FeS converted CO and CH 3 SH into the activated thioester CH 3 -CO-SCH 3 , which hydrolyzed to acetic acid. In the presence of aniline, acetanilide was formed. When NiS-FeS was modified with catalytic amounts of selenium, acetic acid and CH 3 SH were formed from CO and H 2 S alone. The reaction can be considered as the primordial initiation reaction for a chemoautotrophic origin of life."

https://openalex.org/W2007272217,"Regular arrays of topologically complex, millimeter-scale objects were prepared by self-assembly, with the shapes of the assembling objects and the wettability of their surfaces determining the structure of the arrays. The system was composed of solid objects floating at the interface between perfluorodecalin and water and interacting by lateral capillary forces; patterning of the wettability of the surfaces of the objects directs these forces. Self-assembly results from minimization of the interfacial free energy of the liquid-liquid interface. Calculations suggest that this strategy for self-assembly can be applied to objects on a micrometer scale."

https://openalex.org/W2072865736,"Ferroelectric field effect devices offer the possibility of nonvolatile active memory elements. Doped rare-earth manganates, which are usually associated with colossal magnetoresistive properties, have been used as the semiconductor channel material of a prototypical epitaxial field effect device. The carrier concentration of the semiconductor channel can be ""tuned"" by varying the manganate stochiometry. A device with La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 as the semiconductor and PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 as the ferroelectric gate exhibited a modulation in channel conductance of at least a factor of 3 and a retention loss of 3 percent after 45 minutes without power."
https://openalex.org/W2115667067,The participation of medial temporal-lobe structures in memory performance was examined by functional magnetic resonance imaging of local blood oxygenation level–dependent signals. Signals were measured during encoding into memory complex scenes or line drawings and during retrieval from memory of previously studied line drawings or words. Encoding tasks yielded increased signals for unfamiliar information in a posterior medial-temporal region that were focused in the parahippocampal cortex. Retrieval tasks yielded increased signals for successfully remembered information in an anterior medial-temporal region that were focused in the subiculum. These results indicate that separate components of the human medial temporal-lobe memory system are active during distinct memory processes.
https://openalex.org/W2094741750,"Bacterial pathogenesis requires proteins that sense host microenvironments and respond by regulating virulence gene transcription. For Salmonellae, one such regulatory system is PhoP-PhoQ, which regulates genes required for intracellular survival and resistance to cationic peptides. Analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that Salmonella typhimurium PhoP-PhoQ regulated structural modifications of lipid A, the host signaling portion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), by the addition of aminoarabinose and 2-hydroxymyristate. Structurally modified lipid A altered LPS-mediated expression of the adhesion molecule E-selectin by endothelial cells and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression by adherent monocytes. Thus, altered responses to environmentally induced lipid A structural modifications may represent a mechanism for bacteria to gain advantage within host tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2076364749,"The proline-rich COOH-terminal region of dynamin binds various Src homology 3 (SH3) domain–containing proteins, but the physiological role of these interactions is unknown. In living nerve terminals, the function of the interaction with SH3 domains was examined. Amphiphysin contains an SH3 domain and is a major dynamin binding partner at the synapse. Microinjection of amphiphysin’s SH3 domain or of a dynamin peptide containing the SH3 binding site inhibited synaptic vesicle endocytosis at the stage of invaginated clathrin-coated pits, which resulted in an activity-dependent distortion of the synaptic architecture and a depression of transmitter release. These findings demonstrate that SH3-mediated interactions are required for dynamin function and support an essential role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in synaptic vesicle recycling."
https://openalex.org/W2046935041,"Determining the macroevolutionary importance of plant chemistry on herbivore host shifts is critical to understanding the evolution of insect-plant interactions. Molecular phylogenies of the ancient and speciose Blepharida (Coleoptera)-Bursera (Burseraceae) system were reconstructed and terpenoid chemical profiles for the plant species obtained. Statistical analyses show that the historical patterns of host shifts strongly correspond to the patterns of host chemical similarity, indicating that plant chemistry has played a significant role in the evolution of host shifts by phytophagous insects."

https://openalex.org/W2077386452,"Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells responsible for bone resorption. During the resorption cycle, osteoclasts undergo dramatic changes in their polarity, and resorbing cells reveal four functionally and structurally different membrane domains. Bone degradation products, both organic and inorganic, were endocytosed from the ruffled border membrane. They were then found to be transported in vesicles through the cell to the plasma membrane domain, located in the middle of the basal membrane, where they were liberated into the extracellular space. These results explain how resorbing osteoclasts can simultaneously remove large amounts of matrix degradation products and penetrate into bone."
https://openalex.org/W2058774752,"An intracellular pathway for proteins liberated from mineralized matrix during resorption was identified in osteoclasts. Analysis by confocal microscopy of sites of active bone resorption showed that released matrix proteins, including degraded type I collagen, were endocytosed along the ruffled border within the resorption compartment and transcytosed through the osteoclast to the basolateral membrane. Intracellular trafficking of degraded collagen, as typified by the resorbing osteoclast, may provide the cell with a regulatory mechanism for the control of tissue degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2073621667,"The H 2 O-saturated solidus of a model mantle composition (Kilborne Hole peridotite nodule, KLB-1) was determined to be just above 1000°C from 5 to 11 gigapascals. Given reasonable H 2 O abundances in Earth’s mantle, an H 2 O-rich fluid could exist only in a region defined by the wet solidus and thermal stability limits of hydrous minerals, at depths between 90 and 330 kilometers. The experimental partial melts monotonously became more mafic with increasing pressure from andesitic composition at 1 gigapascal to more mafic than the starting peridotite at 10 gigapascals. Because the chemistry of the experimental partial melts is similar to that of kimberlites, it is suggested that kimberlites may be derived by low-temperature melting of an H 2 O-rich mantle at depths of 150 to 300 kilometers."

This effect is specific for macrophage-tropic HIV-1. Transcripts encoding CXCR4/Fusin, the fusion cofactor used by T cell line–tropic isolates, were abundant in CD3/CD28-stimulated cells, but transcripts encoding CCR5, the fusion cofactor used by macrophage-tropic viruses, were not detectable. Thus, CD3/CD28 costimulation induces an HIV-1–resistant phenotype similar to that seen in some highly exposed and HIV-uninfected individuals."

https://openalex.org/W2083124462,"It has been demonstrated previously that respiratory secretions contain three oligomeric, gel-forming mucins; one of these was identified as the product of the <i>MUC5AC</i> gene (1). Here we demonstrate that the other two mucins are glycoforms of the MUC5B gene product. This was accomplished by trypsin treatment of the purified reduced mucin subunit populations and N-terminal sequencing of the liberated peptides. The products of trypsin digestion were separated by gel filtration into high molecular weight mucin glycopeptides and low molecular weight tryptic peptides. The latter were fractionated by reverse phase chromatography, and four of the major peptides were sequenced. Three of these peptides were identical to and contiguous within a 51-amino acid sequence deduced from a cDNA clone (JER57) encoding a portion of the MUC5B mucin. The other peptide is also present within this sequence but showed identity in only 9 of its 10 residues. A polyclonal antiserum raised against one of these peptides was reactive with the two putative MUC5B glycoforms. Analysis of the high molecular weight glycopeptides indicated that the MUC5B subunit contained different types and lengths of glycosylated domains; one domain of <i>M</i><sub>r</sub> 7.3 × 10<sup>5</sup>, two domains of <i>M</i><sub>r</sub> 5.2 × 10<sup>5</sup>, and a third domain of <i>M</i><sub>r</sub> 2.0 × 10<sup>5</sup>. The amino acid composition of the larger two glycopeptides was similar in serine, threonine, and proline content but distinct from that of the smallest glycopeptide. Each of these domains in the mucin subunit is separated by a trypsin-sensitive region, and the relative abundance of the major peptides derived by proteolysis of these regions and their occurrence in a contiguous sequence suggest that they contain a common cysteine-rich motif."
https://openalex.org/W2067336074,"Venom of the western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) induces apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which could result in hemorrhage in tissues bitten by the snake. To identify the hemorrhagic factor, we purified a novel protein, apoxin I, from rattlesnake venom. Apoxin I induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial, human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60, human ovarian carcinoma A2780, and mouse endothelial KN-3 cells. Amino acid sequence analysis of the apoxin I showed close similarity to L-amino acid oxidase from the Malayan pit viper (Calloselasma rhodostoma). The purified apoxin I oxidized L-leucine but not D-leucine to produce H2O2. The apoxin I-induced apoptosis was inhibited by catalase, a H2O2 scavenger. These results indicate that the H2O2 produced by L-amino acid oxidation by apoxin I is involved in the apoxin I-induced apoptosis and in hemorrhage caused by rattlesnake venom.

Apoptosis is a physiological process by which cells undergo controlled cell death, accompanied by nuclear condensation and fragmentation prior to loss of membrane integrity (1Kumar S. Trends Biochem.

Many kinds of stimuli have been reported to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell systems. These include ligation of Fas and tumor necrosis factor receptors by their ligands (4Suda T. Takahashi T.

In addition to these well characterized stimuli, hemorrhagic snake venoms from the western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), mamushi (Agkistrodon halys blomhottii), puff adder (Bitis arietans), and habu (Trimeresurus flavoviridis) induce apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells (14Araki S. Ishida T. Yamamoto T. Kaji K. Hayashi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 148-153Google Scholar), although the active component in the venom is not identified. We report here the identification of the apoptosis-inducing factor apoxin I from venom of the western diamondback rattlesnake that has L-amino acid oxidase (LAO, 1The abbreviations used are: LAOL-amino acid oxidaseZ-VADbenzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzeneZ-Aspbenzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzene.

Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzene (Z-VAD) and benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-CH2OC(O)-2,6-dichlorobenzene (Z-Asp) were synthesized at Kirin Brewery Co. Ltd (Gunma, Japan) as described (15Dolle R.E. Hoyer D. Prasad C.V.C. Schmidt S.J. Helaszek C.T. Miller R.E. Ator M.A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 563-564Google Scholar) and dissolved in Me2SO at 10 mg/ml. Trolox (Aldrich) was dissolved in 1 M NaHCO3 at a concentration of 300 mM, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0. For the experiments, the solution was diluted to the desired concentration with medium. Catalase and all other chemicals were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan) and Sigma. Lyophilized crude venom (100 mg) from the western diamondback rattlesnake (Sigma) was dissolved in 5 ml of distilled water, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (1,000 × g) for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was applied to Sephadex G-100 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; 3 × 60 cm) equilibrated with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.15 M sodium chloride (pH 7.0), and the proteins were eluted with the same buffer at the rate of 0.4 ml/min and collected (4 ml/fraction). The fractions containing apoptosis-inducing activity (fractions 24-32) were pooled and dialyzed against 2 liters of distilled water for 2 days. The active fractions were applied to isoelectric focusing by Rotofor (Bio-Rad) with a constant voltage of 12 watts for 6 h using ampholyte 3/10. The fractions containing apoptosis-inducing activity were pooled (pI, 6.0-6.5), subsequently loaded on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia) connected to a TSK 3000 PWXL (Toso, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia), and eluted with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.15 M sodium chloride (pH 7.0) at the rate of 0.2 ml/min. The elution profile was monitored at 280 nm. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis was carried out as described previously (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and proteins were stained using a two-dimensional silver stain kit (Daiichi, Tokyo, Japan). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells obtained from InvitroCYTE (Seattle, WA) were cultured and maintained in endothelial cell growth medium with low serum growth supplement according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were cultured in collagen-coated dishes (Iwaki Grass, Tokyo, Japan). Human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60, human ovarian carcinoma A2780, and mouse endothelial KN-3 cells were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 100 mg/ml kanamycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. All experiments were performed using cells during the exponential growth phase. Cells (0.5 × 106) were treated with 10 μg/ml purified apoxin I for 18 h, except for HL-60 cells, which were treated for 4 h, in the growth medium and then harvested. After cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in methanol/acetate (3:1) for 10 min, cells were stained with 20 μl of 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma); one drop of fixed cells was placed on a glass slide. Nuclear morphology was observed by a Nikon UFX-IIA fluorescent microscope as described previously (17Noguchi K. Naito M. Kugou H. Oshimura M. Mashima T. Fujita N. Yonehara S. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 39-46Google Scholar). After treatment with apoxin I, HL-60 cells (0.5 × 106) were suspended in 20 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma). After incubation at 50°C for 1 h, 10 μl of 0.5 μg/ml RNase A solution was added, and the suspension was incubated for an additional hour. The sample was mixed with 10 μl of the preheated (70°C) solution containing 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% (w/v) low melting point agarose (Sigma), 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 40% sucrose. DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and then photographed on a UV transilluminator (18Noguchi K. Naito M. Kataoka S. Yonehara S. Tsuruo T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1271-1277Google Scholar). HL-60 cells (0.5 × 106) were pretreated with or without 160 μM Z-VAD, 200 μM Z-Asp, or antioxidants for 1 h, and then cells were treated with 5 μg/ml apoxin I or 20 μM H2O2 for 4 h. Cells were harvested, fixed in 70% ethanol, treated with RNase A (1 mg/ml in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0), and stained with propidium iodide solution (50 μg/ml in 0.1% sodium citrate and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Cells were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson (Braintree, MA) FACScan flow cytometer (18Noguchi K. Naito M. Kataoka S. Yonehara S. Tsuruo T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1271-1277Google Scholar). The purified apoxin I was blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ProBlott, Applied Biosystems) and applied to Applied Biosystems 477A and Beckman LF3400D peptide sequencers. Data were analyzed by the sequencers automatically, and we confirmed the data by checking the chromatograms. The reaction mixtures (1 ml) containing the 1 μg/ml or 2 μg/ml purified apoxin I, 50 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase (5 milliunits/ml), 10 μM O-dianisidine, and 10 μML-leucine or D-leucine in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) were incubated at 25°C, and the initial rate was measured as the increase in absorbance at 436 nm (19Ponnudurai G. Chung M.C. Tan N.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 373-378Google Scholar) with a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. Purified apoxin I was labeled with fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate as described previously (20Tzeng C.M. Hsu L.H. Pan R.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 737-743Google Scholar). HL-60 cells were treated with the fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate-labeled apoxin I (5 μg/ml) for 4 h at 37°C, and observed by fluorescent microscopy. Crude venom from rattlesnake was first subjected to a Sephadex G-100 gel filtration column followed by a Rotofor isoelectric focusing apparatus; major apoptosis-inducing activity was detected in fractions of pI 6.0-6.5. The active fractions were collected and applied to fast protein liquid chromatography equipped with a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column directly connected to a TSK 3000 PWXL column. The activity was eluted as a single peak with a molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa (Fig. 1a). The purification yielded 1.48% of the crude venom proteins. According to the LAO activity (described below), the purified protein was concentrated 56-fold from the crude venom, and the recovery of the LAO activity was 83%. The purified protein, named apoxin I, showed a homogenous single band of 55 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (Fig. 1b), suggesting that apoxin I has a dimeric conformation under natural conditions. Apoxin I at 10 μg/ml induced chromatin condensation and segregation in human umbilical vein endothelial, HL-60, A2780, and KN-3 cells (Fig. 2). The nuclear morphological changes typical of apoptosis were also observed in U937 and K562 cells (not shown). To confirm the induction of apoptosis by apoxin I, we examined a DNA fragmentation assay in the apoxin I-treated cells. Apoxin I above 2.5 μg/ml caused fragmentation of nuclear DNA into an oligosomal ladder in HL-60 cells (Fig. 3a), and the fragmentation began to occur 2 h after apoxin I treatment (Fig. 3b). Apoxin I at concentrations lower than 2.5 μg/ml did not induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells even by 24 h of treatment. We further examined the apoxin I-induced apoptosis by flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Fig. 4 apoptotic cells containing DNA at less than G1 dramatically increased when HL-60 cells were treated with 10 μg/ml apoxin I for 4 h. In addition, inhibitors of the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme family proteases Z-VAD and Z-Asp (11Mashima T. Naito M. Kataoka S. Kawai H. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 907-915Google Scholar, 15Dolle R.E. Hoyer D. Prasad C.V.C. Schmidt S.J. Helaszek C.T. Miller R.E. Ator M.A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 563-564Google Scholar) completely prevented the appearance of apoptotic populations in apoxin I-treated cells (Fig. 4 c and d). Z-VAD and Z-Asp also inhibited the nuclear condensation caused by 10 μg/ml Apoxin I (not shown). These results indicate that apoxin I induced apoptosis in such cell lines.Fig. 3Oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in apoxin I-treated cells. HL-60 (0.5 × 106) cells were treated with indicated concentrations of apoxin I for 4 h (a) or with 5 μg/ml apoxin I for the indicated times (b).

Nineteen of 20 amino acids were identified (Fig. 5). According to a protein sequence data base search, it was revealed that the sequence has a close similarity (75% identity) to LAO from Malayan pit viper (Calloselasma rhodostoma) venom and a moderate similarity (45% identity) to LAO from king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) venom (19Ponnudurai G. Chung M.C. Tan N.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 373-378Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). The LAO from the Malayan pit viper is a homodimeric glycoprotein composed of a 66-kDa polypeptide as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (19Ponnudurai G. Chung M.C. Tan N.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 373-378Google Scholar), resembling apoxin I. Therefore, we measured the LAO activity of the purified apoxin I. Apoxin I oxidized L-leucine in a dose- and time-dependent manner, whereas it did not oxidize D-leucine (Fig. 6), indicating that apoxin I is a LAO.Fig. 6L-Amino acid oxidase activity of the purified apoxin I. The purified apoxin I (circles, 2 μg/ml, square, 1 μg/ml) was incubated with 10 μML-leucine (closed symbols) or 10 μMD-leucine (open symbols) at 25°C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The increase in absorbance was measured at 436 nm with a spectrophotometer. ×, control experiment in the absence of apoxin I.

The oxidation by LAO of L-amino acid under oxygenated conditions results in the production of the corresponding α-keto acid, NH3, and H2O2 (21Vallon O. Bulte L. Kuras R. Olive J. Wollman F.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 351-360Google Scholar, 22Li Z.Y. Yu T.F. Lian E.C. Toxicon. 1994; 32: 1349-1358Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the effects of scavengers of reactive oxygen species on the apoxin I-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 7 catalase completely inhibited apoptosis induced by apoxin I and H2O2, indicating that H2O2 mediates apoxin I-induced apoptosis. We prepared fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate-labeled apoxin I to investigate subcellular localization of apoxin I by fluorescent microscopy. Our preliminary results showed that apoxin I accumulated in the cellular plasma membrane. Further study is now in progress. According to these results, we tested antioxidants for the inhibition of the apoxin I-induced apoptosis. A membrane antioxidant, trolox (23McClain D.E. Kalinich J.F. Ramakrishnan N. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1345-1354Google Scholar), but not a water-soluble antioxidant, L-ascorbate (24Beyer R.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 349-358Google Scholar), inhibited the apoxin I-induced apoptosis (Fig. 7). These results suggest that apoptosis is triggered by membrane oxidation by H2O2 produced by apoxin I accumulating in the cellular plasma membrane. Venoms of several snake species contain large amounts of LAO, but its biological effects are largely unknown. It was reported that LAO from king cobra (O. hannah) venom induced platelet aggregation (22Li Z.Y. Yu T.F. Lian E.C. Toxicon. 1994; 32: 1349-1358Google Scholar). The LAO-induced platelet aggregation is inhibited by catalase, suggesting that H2O2 also mediates LAO-induced platelet aggregation (22Li Z.Y. Yu T.F. Lian E.C. Toxicon. 1994; 32: 1349-1358Google Scholar). We do not know whether all the LAOs from different snake species show similar biological effects; however, it is likely they do, because H2O2 mediated the biological effects of LAO. These observations, together with our present study, suggest that treatment with antioxidants might protect tissues affected by snake bite from various types of harmful snake venom.

The cDNA encoded a predicted protein of 290 amino acids, designated core promoter-binding protein (CPBP), which has three zinc fingers (type Cys2-His2) at the end of its C-terminal domain, a serine/threonine-rich central region and an acidic domain lying within the N-terminal region. Additional sequence analysis and data base searches revealed that only the zinc finger domains are conserved (60-80% identity) in other transcription factors. In cotransfection assays, CPBP increased the transcription from a minimal promoter containing its natural DNA-binding site. Moreover, a chimeric protein between CPBP and Gal4 DNA binding domain also increased the activity of an heterologous reporter gene containing Gal4 DNA binding sites. The tissue distribution analysis of CPBP mRNA revealed that it is differentially expressed with an apparent enrichment in placental cells. The DNA binding and transcriptional activity of CPBP, in conjunction with its expression pattern, strongly suggests that this protein may participate in the regulation and/or maintenance of the basal expression of PSG and possibly other TATA box-less genes.

The mechanism of action of bacterial toxins has provided novel insights into the control of cellular regulatory processes, including signal transduction and cell proliferation. For example, the Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme and the enterotoxins A and B from Clostridium difficile which selectively inactivate members of the Rho subfamily, have provided useful tools to evaluate the role of these small G proteins in signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization (31Aktories K.

Here we report that CNF1 and DNT stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of p125fak and paxillin and induce a concomitant increase in the formation of actin stress fibers and in the assembly of focal adhesion plaques in Swiss 3T3 cells. Microinjection of C3 exoenzyme prevented both the cytoskeletal responses and the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins.

In addition, CNF1 and DNT both stimulated reinitiation of DNA synthesis but neither induce activation of p42mapk (ERK2). Thus, our results demonstrating that CNF1 and DNT induce a specific subset of molecular and cytoskeletal responses in Swiss 3T3 cells provide novel evidence for the existence of a signal transduction pathway that links p21rho activation to tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins. Stock cultures of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air at 37°C. For experimental purposes, cells were plated either in 30-mm Nunc Petri dishes at 105 cells/dish, or in 90-mm dishes at 6 × 105 cells/dish, in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and used after 6-8 days when the cells were confluent and quiescent (41Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2936-2940Google Scholar). Quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated with DMEM/Waymouth's medium 1:1 (v/v) containing [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) and various factors as indicated. After 40 h, the cultures were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 5% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4°C. Trichloroacetic acid was then removed and the cultures were washed twice with ethanol and extracted in 1 ml of 2% Na2CO3, 0.1 M NaOH, 1% SDS. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was determined by scintillation counting in 6 ml of scintillation fluid. The proportion of cells in the G0/G1, S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis as described previously (42Herget T. Brooks S.F. Broad S. Rozengurt H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1993; 909: 2945-2949Google Scholar). Quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells (1-2 × 106) were washed twice with DMEM, treated with CNF1, DNT, or PMT or other factors in 10 ml of DMEM/Waymouth (1:1, v/v) for the times indicated and lysed at 4°C in 1 ml of a lysis buffer solution containing 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 100 μM Na3VO4, and 1% Triton X-100. Proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4°C overnight with agarose-linked mAbs directed against phosphotyrosine, paxillin, or p125fak as indicated. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and extracted for 10 min at 95°C in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl, 6% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Treatment of quiescent cultures of cells with factors, cell lysis, and immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes (43Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS, pH 7.2, and incubated for 3-5 h at 22°C with PY72 or 4G10 anti-Tyr(P) mAbs (1 μg/ml). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using 125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG followed by autoradiography. Autoradiograms were scanned using an LKB Ultrascan XL internal integrator. The values expressed represent percentages of the maximum increase in tyrosine phosphorylation above control values. Quiescent and confluent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells in 30-mm dishes were washed twice in phosphate-free DMEM and incubated at 37°C with this medium containing 50 μCi/ml carrier-free [32P]Pi. After 12 h, various factors were added for the indicated times. The cells were subsequently lysed and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with specific anti-80K/MARCKS antibody (44Erusalimsky J.D. Brooks S.F. Herget T. Morris C. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7073-7080Google Scholar). Cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells in 33-mm dishes were labeled for 16-18 h in 1 ml of DMEM/Waymouth's medium (1:1) containing 10 μCi of [2-3H]inositol. Additions were made to the cells as described for each experiment and LiCl was added to a final concentration of 20 mM for the last 30 min of the incubation. Inositol phosphates were extracted by replacing the medium with 1 ml of ice-cold 3% HClO4. After 20 min at 4°C the extract was neutralized with 0.5 M KOH containing 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.01% phenol red. Precipitated KClO4 was removed by centrifugation. Analysis of total inositol phosphates was by anion-exchange column chromatography (45Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Google Scholar). Samples were diluted to 10 ml with water and then loaded onto 1 ml of Dowex AG1-X8 (100-200 mesh, HCOO− form) in Bio-Rad Econo-columns. After 3 washes with 3 × 10 ml of H2O and 2 × 10 ml of 60 mM NH4COOH, 5 mM Na2B4O7 the inositol phosphates were eluted with 7 ml of 1 M NH4COOH, 0.1 M HCOOH. An aliquot (1 ml) of eluate was counted in 10 ml of scintillation fluid. To determine the intracellular concentration of Ca2+, [Ca2+]i, 5 × 105 cells were subcultured with 10 ml of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum in 90-mm Nunc dishes. After 6-8 days, when the cells were confluent and quiescent, the medium was replaced with 5 ml of DMEM/Waymouth's medium (1:1). The cells were pretreated as indicated, and then 5 μl of 1 mM fura-2/AM (46Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar, 47Lopez-Rivas A. Mendoza S.A.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2741-2747Google Scholar) was added directly to the medium. After a further 10 min the cells were washed twice at 37°C with 3 ml of electrolyte solution, comprising 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 0.9 mM MgCl2, 25 mM glucose, 16 mM HEPES, 6 mM Tris, pH 7.2, and the amino acid content of DMEM. The cells were then gently removed from the dish by scraping into 2 ml of the electrolyte solution. The cell suspension was transferred to a 1-cm2 quartz cuvette and stirred at 37°C for 4 min prior to any additions. Fluorescence was measured in a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 fluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 510 nm. [Ca2+]i was calculated from the maximum and minimum fluorescence of the fura-2, as described (46Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar, 49Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Rink T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 325-334Google Scholar). Quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated for the indicated times in DMEM/Waymouth's medium (1:1, v/v) at 37°C with CNF1, DNT, or PMT. For actin staining, cells were washed once with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 8 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with FITC-conjugated phalloidin (0.25 μg/ml) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and visualized using a Zeiss Axiophot immunofluorescence microscope. In experiments in which quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were labeled with both FITC-conjugated phalloidin and anti-vinculin antibody, the cells were fixed and permeabilized as described above and then stained with a mixture of FITC-conjugated phalloidin (0.25 μg/ml) and anti-vinculin antibody (dilution 1:100) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were subsequently washed three times in PBS and then incubated with Cy3-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG as a secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:100 for another 30 min at room temperature. For microinjection experiments Swiss 3T3 cells were plated in 33-mm Nunc Petri dishes at 105 cells/dish in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and used after 6-8 days when the cells were confluent and quiescent. Approximately 50 cells were microinjected with 100 μg/ml recombinant C3 exoenzyme. The efficiency of injection was determined by co-injecting guinea pig immunoglobulin at 0.5 mg/ml followed by staining with FITC-linked goat anti-guinea pig IgG. A single batch of C3 transferase was used in all experiments described. Confocal imaging was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser scanning head fitted to a Nikon Optiphot microscope. A 60X N.A./1.4 planapochromat oil immersion lens (Nikon) was used for all imaging. FITC-conjugated phalloidin and Cy3 anti-mouse IgG fluorochromes were excited at 488 and 568 nm, respectively, using a krypton/argon mixed gas laser (Bio-Rad). Two filter blocks were used, K1 and K2. K1 is a double dichromic filter enabling excitation at the wavelengths of 488 and 568 nm, whereas the K2 filter is a 560-nm dichromic combined with 522-nm green emission and 585-nm red emission filters. Images were collected using the Kalman filter. Care was taken to ensure that the FITC-conjugated phalloidin channel was sufficiently bright relative to the fluorescein signal to minimize the contribution of bleed-through from the green channel into the red channel (approximately 10%). Correction of images for bleed-through and other processing was carried out using COMOS and SOM programs (Bio-Rad) run on a Compaq Deskpro 66M 486 computer (66 MHz). Data are presented as projections of sequential optical sections. For Z-series, optical sections were recorded at 0.5-μm intervals. Final images were photographed directly from the VDU screen. Activation of p42mapk and p44mapk was determined by the appearance of slower migrating forms in gel electrophoresis due to phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues (50Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 569-574Google Scholar). Lysates from quiescent cells in 33-mm dishes prepared as above were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon membranes. Membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against COOH-terminal peptides (EETARFQPGYRS for p42mapk and IFQETARFQPGAPE for the p44mapk) were used at 1/1000 dilution, and 125I-protein A was used to visualize immunoreactive bands. Strain pISS392 is E. coli DH5α containing plasmid pISS392 which consists of a 3.5-kilobase fragment encoding only CNF1 inserted into the vector pGEM3. Control strain pGEM3 is E. coli DH5α containing a plasmid derived from pISS392 by deletion of a 3.5-kilobase insert. It is pGEM3 with a deletion in the multiple cloning site. Strain DNT1 is E. coli XL1-Blue containing plasmid pDNT1 which consists of a 5-kilobase fragment encoding the DNT gene (B bronchiseptica B58) inserted into the vector pBluescript. Control strain pBlue is E. coli XL1-Blue with plasmid pBluescript (51Pullinger G.D. Adams T.E. Mullan P.B. Garrod T.I. Lax A.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4163-4171Google Scholar). Strain pTOX2 is E. coli XL1-Blue with plasmid pTOX2 which consists of the vector pBluescript with an approximately 4-kilobase pair insert encoding PMT. Control strain pBlue is E. coli XL1-Blue with plasmid pBluescript here nominated PC12. The E. coli strains were grown overnight from a fresh colony. They were lysed in the lysis buffer (50 μg/ml lysozyme, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% toluene, 0.05 M Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, 0.1 M NaCl) treated with RNase and DNase at 10 μg/ml each to remove nucleic acid and filtered through a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose filter. Bombesin, cytochalasin D, FITC-conjugated phalloidin, monoclonal anti-vinculin mAb, Cy3-linked anti-mouse IgG, guinea pig IgG, and FITC-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant PDGF (BB homodimer), 125I-sheep anti-mouse IgG (15 mCi/mg), carrier-free [32P]Pi, and [2-3H]inositol (18.8 Ci/mmol, 1 Ci = 37 GBq) were all supplied by Amersham Corp., United Kingdom. Agarose-linked anti-Tyr(P) mAb was purchased from Oncogene Science Inc., New York. 4G10 anti-Tyr(P) mAb was from UBI, Lake Placid, NY. mAb 2A7 directed against p125fak was from TCS Biologicals Ltd., Buckingham, United Kingdom. p125fak immunoblotting was performed with mAb from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY. The anti-Tyr(P) mAb PY72 was obtained from the hybridoma development unit, Imperial Cancer Research Fund. Clone pISS392 was kindly supplied by Dr. A. Caprioli, Instituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy. All other reagents were of the highest grade commercially available. The C3 C botulinum exoenzyme was a gift from Dr. N. Morii and Professor S. Narumiya, Department of Pharmacology, Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine, Sakyo-ku 606, Japan. To examine the effects of CNF1 on tyrosine phosphorylation, quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with the control bacterial lysate (pGEM3) or with lysate containing CNF1 for 6 h. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P) mAb followed by Western blotting with an anti-Tyr(P) mAb. As shown in Fig. 1A, CNF1 markedly stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of a group of bands migrating with an apparent Mr of 110,000-130,000 and 70,000-80,000. The pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins induced by CNF1 is similar to that stimulated by bombesin, bioactive lipids, and PMT in Swiss 3T3 cells (8Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Turner C.E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22060-22065Google Scholar, 13Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9345-9351Google Scholar, 15Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol.

The cytosolic tyrosine kinase p125fak and the adaptor protein paxillin have been identified as prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in Swiss 3T3 cells treated with these agents. To determine whether these cellular proteins were also substrates for CNF1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, extracts from Swiss 3T3 cells, incubated with the control bacterial lysate (pGEM3) or CNF1 for 6 h, were immunoprecipitated with mAbs that recognize either p125fak or paxillin, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Tyr(P) mAb. As shown in Fig. 1A, CNF1 markedly stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p125fak and paxillin in Swiss 3T3 cells. The control bacterial lysate (pGEM3) did not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of these bands or of any other protein (data not shown). Neuropeptides and lysophosphatidic acid induce tyrosine phosphorylation of p125fak and paxillin within minutes of treatment (6Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19031-19034Google Scholar, 8Zachary I. Sinnett-Smith J. Turner C.E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22060-22065Google Scholar, 13Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9345-9351Google Scholar), whereas there is a lag period of 1 h between the addition of PMT and a detectable increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins (22Lacerda H.M. Lax A.J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 439-445Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, CNF1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p125fak and paxillin occurred after a lag period of 2 h, reached a maximum after 8 h of treatment and declined to 56%± 9.5 (mean ± S.E.) of the maximum after 24 h. This is in contrast to the tyrosine phosphorylation of p125fak and paxillin stimulated by PMT which remains maximal after 24 h of treatment (data not shown). Immunoblotting with p125fak mAb of anti-p125fak immunoprecipitates prepared in parallel with those used for the assays of tyrosine phosphorylation verified that similar amounts of p125fak were recovered after different times of CNF1 treatment (Fig. 1B). Next we examined whether the lag period in CNF1 action reflects a requirement for internalization and activation of the toxin during transit through endosomal/lysosomal compartments. The lysosomotrophic agent methylamine, a membrane-permeant weak base known to inhibit lysosomal processing, completely blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of the Mr 110,000-130,000 and Mr 70,000-80,000 bands in response to CNF1 (Fig. 1C). Methylamine also prevented the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p125fak in response to CNF1 (Fig. 1C). The inhibitory effect of methylamine was selective because it did not prevent the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation induced by bombesin in parallel cultures (data not shown). It is also known that the entry of many bacterial toxins into the cell cytoplasm is temperature-dependent. Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with CNF1 for 6 h at 22°C failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). In contrast, bombesin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Mr 110,000-130,000 and Mr 70,000-80,000 bands in parallel cultures incubated at 22°C (data not shown). Therefore, CNF1 appears to enter cells via an endosomal/lysosomal pathway where it is processed and released into the cytosol in an active form to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of p125fak and paxillin. Given the localization of p125fak and p"

Mutations in rBAT have been found to cause cystinuria (Calonge, M.

The Km and the voltage dependence for transport of the different substrates were the same in both M467T and wild type-injected oocytes. However, the time course of transport was delayed in the M467T mutant: maximal activity was accomplished 3-4 days later than in the wild type. This delay was cRNA dose-dependent: at cRNA levels below 0.5 ng the M467T failed to achieve the wild type transport level. The M467K mutant displayed a normal Km, but the Vmax was between 5 and 35% of the wild type. The amount of rBAT protein was similar in normal and mutant-injected oocytes. In contrast to the wild type, the mutant proteins remained endoglycosidase H-sensitive, suggesting a longer residence time in the endoplasmic reticulum. We quantified the amount of rBAT protein in the plasma membrane by surface labeling with biotin 2 and 6 days after injection. Most of the M467T and M467K protein was located in an intracellular compartment. The converse situation was found in the wild type. Despite the low amount of M467T protein reaching the plasma membrane, the transport activity at 6 days was the same as in the wild type-injected oocytes. The increase in plasma membrane rBAT protein between 2 and 6 days was completely dissociated from the rise in transport activity. These data indicate impaired maturation and transport to the plasma membrane of the M467T and M467K mutant, and suggest that rBAT alone is unable to support the transport function.

This variability is associated with a number of genetic disorders in humans including triplet expansion diseases such as Fragile X syndrome and Huntington's disease. The mechanism responsible for the variability/instability of these tandem arrays remains contentious. We show here that formation of secondary structures, in particular intrastrand tetraplexes, is an intrinsic property of some of the more unstable arrays. Tetraplexes block DNA polymerase progression and may promote instability of tandem arrays by increasing the likelihood of reiterative strand slippage. In the course of doing this work we have shown that some of these tetraplexes involve unusual base interactions. These interactions not only generate tetraplexes with novel properties but also lead us to conclude that the number of sequences that can form stable tetraplexes might be much larger than previously thought.

We constructed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant of which the ECT1 gene, putatively encoding ET, was disrupted. This mutant showed a growth defect on ethanolamine-containing medium and a decrease of ET activity. A cDNA clone was isolated from a human glioblastoma cDNA expression library by complementation of the yeast mutant. Introduction of this cDNA into the yeast mutant clearly restored the formation of CDP-ethanolamine and phosphatidylethanolamine in cells. ET activity in transformants was higher than that in wild-type cells. The deduced protein sequence exhibited homology with the yeast, rat, and human CTP-phosphocholine cytidylyltransferases, as well as yeast ET. The cDNA gene product was expressed as a fusion with glutathione S-transferase in Escherichia coli and shown to have ET activity.

In mammalian cells, this phospholipid can be synthesized de novo via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, by decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine, and by the calcium-dependent exchange of ethanolamine with the base moiety of pre-existing phospholipids (1van den Bosch H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1974; 43: 243-277Google Scholar). Although the exact contributions of each of these pathways remain to be established, the CDP-ethanolamine pathway probably plays an important role in the synthesis of PtdEtn (2Sundler R. Akesson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3359-3367Google Scholar). CTP-phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (ET; EC 2.7.7.14) catalyzes the synthesis of CDP-ethanolamine from CTP and phosphoethanolamine, and is considered to be an important regulatory enzyme in the CDP-ethanolamine pathway through analogy with the CDP-choline pathway.

The properties of CT have been extensively studied, and the role of CT in the regulation of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) biosynthesis has been well established (3Kent C. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 87-105Google Scholar). The sequences have been determined for several mammalian CT cDNAs (4Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. LaChance A. Aebersold R. Cornell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CT exists in an inactive soluble form and an active membrane-bound form. Regulation of the translocation process by changes in the lipid composition of cellular membranes seems to be one of the major mechanisms for the control of CT activity. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the enzyme are also correlated to the translocation of CT to membranes; the soluble form is highly phosphorylated, and translocation of CT to membranes is accompanied by extensive dephosphorylation. Multiple phosphorylation sites at the C terminus have been identified (9MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537Google Scholar, 10Yang W. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16503-16506Google Scholar). CT is thought to have a bipartite structure composed of a globular N-terminal catalytic domain and an extended C-terminal domain. Between the catalytic domain and the phosphorylation region is a sequence that is predicted to form amphipathic α-helices and to interact with the membrane bilayer of activating phospholipids (11Craig L. Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3311-3317Google Scholar, 12Wieder T. Geilen C.C. Wieprecht M. Becker A. Orfanos C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 207-210Google Scholar). Unlike for CT, the protein structure and regulatory properties of ET have been studied much less extensively. ET has been purified 1,000-fold from a post-microsomal fraction of rat liver by Sundler (13Sundler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8585-8590Google Scholar). van Golde et al. recently purified ET to homogeneity from rat liver (14Vermeulen P.S. Tijburg L.B.M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7458-7464Google Scholar). The purified protein has a molecular weight of about 50,000 and appears to be a dimer. ET has long been tacitly assumed to be regulated like CT. However, there is accumulating evidence that the control mechanisms for the ET and CT activities are different (15Tijburg L.B.M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 1-19Google Scholar). Only sequence information for the yeast S. cerevisiae gene putatively encoding ET is available. Yeast cells possess phospholipid-synthetic pathways quite similar to those found in other eukaryotic cells. Yeast gene ECT1, 2During the preparation of our manuscript, the characterization of yeast ECT1 gene, which encodes ET, was reported by Min-Seok et al. (31Min-Seok R. Kawamata Y. Nakamura H. Ohta A. Takagi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1040-1047Google Scholar) and shown to be identical to MUQ1 (accession number GenBank D50644). In this paper, we use the name ECT1, which better describes its function. originally known as MUQ1 (16Horowitz D.S. Abelson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2959-2970Google Scholar), encodes a protein similar to CTs of yeast and other species and, therefore, is thought to encode ET. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a human cDNA encoding ET by genetic complementation of a yeast mutant defective in ECT1 Saccharomyces cerevisiae DS15-3 (MATα ise leu2 his3) was used as the wild-type strain and as the recipient for ECT1 disruption. DS15-3 is a segregant of the diploid strain, DS15 (17Matsushita M. Nikawa J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 447-451Google Scholar). The ise mutant is a conditional ethanolamine auxotroph whose growth is inhibited by high concentrations of inositol, and the growth defect is suppressed by the addition of ethanolamine to the culture medium (18Yamashita S. Oshima A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 104: 611-616Google Scholar). Yeast cells were cultured in either YPD or synthetic minimal medium at 30°C. The compositions of the YPD and inositol-free minimal media were reported previously (18Yamashita S. Oshima A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 104: 611-616Google Scholar). The composition of nitrogen-free minimal medium (M-N) is given in 19Hosaka K. Yamashita S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 176-181Google Scholar. Inositol, L-leucine and L-histidine were each added to the culture media at the concentration of 20 μg/ml. Ethanolamine was added to the culture media at the concentration of 10 μg/ml. The yeast ECT1 gene was amplified from chromosomal DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR primers used were 5′-TCTAGATGACGGTAAACTTAGATC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-ATGTAATACCAGTTTTCTTA-3′ (reverse primer). The complementary oligonucleotides contained additional sequences (underlined), so there was a BamHI restriction site at the 5′ end and a SalI site at the 3′ end of the PCR products. An about 1-kbp PCR product was digested with BamHI and SalI, purified by gel electrophoresis, and then inserted between the BamHI and SalI sites of pUC18 to yield pUC-ECT. By comparing the restriction maps of the isolated clone and the reported one, and partial sequencing of the cloned fragment, plasmid pUC-ECT was confirmed to contain the yeast ECT1 gene. The 0.4-kbp EcoRV/XhoI fragment of pUC-ECT located within the ECT1 coding frame was replaced with a 1.3-kbp HincII/XhoI fragment containing yeast HIS3 to yield pUC-ect::HIS3. The 1.9-kbp SphI/SalI fragment of this plasmid was used for the transformation of DS15-3. His+ colonies were selected. One disruptant strain, of which the gene disruption was confirmed by Southern blot analysis, was designated as NA9 and used for the isolation of human cDNA. cDNA Cloning—A human cDNA library made from glioblastoma cells was constructed on a yeast multicopy vector, pADANS, which contains the yeast ADH1 promoter, the following small part of the coding region, and the terminator (20Colicelli J. Nicolette C. Birchmeier C. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2913-2917Google Scholar). Inserted cDNAs are designed to be expressed in yeast cells as a fusion protein with ADH1 N-terminal amino acids. NA9 was transformed with the cDNA library, and the colonies that grew on a minimal medium supplemented with inositol and ethanolamine were selected. Colonies that grew on a medium supplemented with inositol alone were excluded. Plasmids were recovered from the transformants and used for Escherichia coli transformation. DNA was sequenced manually using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) with Klenow fragment (Takara Shuzo) and [32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.) on the M13 phage vector. The primers were either universal or a series of oligonucleotides synthesized for the partial cDNA sequence. Amino acid sequence similarities were found using the BLAST program, and the translation of nucleotide sequences in the GenBank and EMBL data bases. Alignments were further improved by eye. Only amino acid identities were considered. An adult human multitissue Northern blot (Clontech) was hybridized with a random primed (Takara Shuzo) 32P-labeled entire cDNA fragment as a probe. Hybridization was carried out at 42°C overnight in a hybridization solution containing 50% formamide, 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 5 × SSC (1 × SSC: 0.15 M NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate, pH7.0), 1 × Denhardt's (0.1% each of bovine serum albumin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and Ficoll), and 0.1% SDS. The filter was washed twice at room temperature with 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 10 min, and then twice with 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 50°C for 15 min. Exponentially growing yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with M-N medium, and then resuspended in the same medium. To 1 ml of culture of each strain was added 7.4 kBq of [1,2-14C]ethanolamine and 0.4 μmol of ethanolamine, and then the mixture was incubated at 30°C. At the indicated times, 5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to the culture. The mixture was then filtered through GF/C glass-microfiber paper (Whatman). The filter paper was washed three times with 5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid and dried, and then radioactivity was counted after treatment with Scintilamine-OH (Dojindo) as described previously (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). The uptake of the labeled precursors into cells during the above incubation was determined by counting the radioactivity in cells collected by filtration through GF/C glass-microfiber paper as described previously (22Nikawa J. Yonemura K. Yamashita S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 223-229Google Scholar). For the lipid analysis, cells were cultured under the specified conditions, collected by centrifugation, and then suspended in M-N medium. To 2 ml of cell suspension was added [1,2-14C]ethanolamine or [methyl-14C]choline (37 kBq each). After the incubation at 30°C for 60 min, cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 100 μl of methanol, and then sonicated. To the sonicated sample was added 200 μl of chloroform to extract the lipids. The extract was washed once with 300 μl of saline, twice with 300 μl of methanol-saline (1:1, v/v), and then evaporated. Lipids were dissolved in 50 μl of chloroform and chromatographed on a Silica Gel 60 plate (Merk) with chloroform-methanol-acetic acid-formic acid-water (35:15:6:2:1, by volume) as a developing solvent. Radioactive materials were located by autoradiography. For the analysis of water-soluble metabolites, 1 ml of a culture of cells in M-N medium was incubated with 37 kBq of [1,2-14C]ethanolamine for 60 min, and then the cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 50 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After standing on ice for 20 min, the insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was subjected to analysis by thin-layer chromatography on a Silica Gel 60 plate with ethanol and 2% ammonia (1:1, v/v). Radioactive materials were located by autoradiography. A SmaI/EcoRI fragment excised from the cDNA clone was ligated between the SmaI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The plasmid, pGEX-hECT, thus obtained was used for expression in E. coli Briefly, overnight cultures of E. coli JM103 harboring the pGEX-hECT plasmid were diluted in fresh medium and then grown for another 2 h at 37°C. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG), and after a further 3 h of growth, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM EDTA and 20% glycerol. The cells were then lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was used as a crude cell extract for determination of the enzyme activity. A part of the IPTG-treated and untreated cells, respectively, was used for protein analysis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of total E. coli proteins was performed in 10% polyacrylamide mini-slab gels, essentially as described by Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Molecular weight references were purchased from Sigma. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue using a Quick-CBB kit (Wako). ET activity of fusion protein was determined in a reaction mixture comprising 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CTP, 5 mM dithiothreitol, [1,2-14C]phosphoethanolamine, and E. coli cell extract, in a total volume of 25 μl. After 30 min of incubation at 30°C, the reaction was stopped by heating at 100°C for 5 min. The reaction product was separated by thin-layer chromatography on a Silica Gel 60 plate as described above. Protein determination was carried out with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Yeast cells were cultured in a minimal medium on a Bio-Shaker BR-30 (Taitec) to the early stationary phase at 30°C, harvested, and disrupted by vortexing vigorously with glass beads (diameter, 0.3 mm) in 10 mM Tris-Cl containing 1 mM EDTA and 20% glycerol for 5 min. Disrupted cells were centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant fraction was used for the determination of ET and CT activities as described previously (22Nikawa J. Yonemura K. Yamashita S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 223-229Google Scholar) except that the total volume was reduced to 50 μl. All enzyme reactions were carried out at 25°C for 10 min or 20 min. Restriction endonucleases and other nucleic acid-modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara Shuzo. Taq DNA polymerase was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. [α-32P]dCTP (110 TBq/mmol), [methyl-14C]choline (2.04 GBq/mmol), and [methyl-14C]phosphocholine (2.07 GBq/mmol) were obtained from Amersham. [1,2-14C]Ethanolamine (170 MBq/mmol) was from DuPont NEN. CTP was from Yamasa. Choline chloride, ethanolamine, phosphocholine, and phosphoethanolamine were from Tokyo Kasei. Other chemicals were from Wako Chemicals. [1,2-14C]Phosphoethanolamine was prepared from [1,2-14C]ethanolamine through the action of yeast choline kinase (24Hosaka K. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2053-2059Google Scholar) and purified as described by Sundler (25Sundler R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 306: 218-226Google Scholar). Based on the structural similarity, the S. cerevisiae ECT1 gene was thought to encode ET (16Horowitz D.S. Abelson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2959-2970Google Scholar). To confirm this, we constructed an yeast strain of which the ECT1 gene was disrupted. Although mutants carrying the ect1 mutation alone could exhibit no growth phenotype, the combination of the ect1 and ise mutants allowed us to detect the phenotype of the ect1 mutation. The ise mutation is a conditional choline- or ethanolamine-auxotrophic mutant of which the growth is inhibited by high concentrations of inositol (18Yamashita S. Oshima A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 104: 611-616Google Scholar). As was expected, an ect1 ise double mutant, NA9, we constructed did not grow on inositol- and ethanolamine-containing media, although it grew normally on inositol- and choline-containing media or on inositol-free media. The mutant also showed the decreased levels of the synthesis of CDP-ethanolamine and PtdEtn as well as low levels of ET activities (see below). These results strongly indicate that the ECT1 encodes ET. Using the ect1 ise mutant, we next attempted to clone the human cDNA for ET by the complementation method. Strain NA9 was transformed with a human cDNA expression library, and the colonies that grew on a minimal medium supplemented with inositol and ethanolamine but not on a medium supplemented with inositol alone were selected. Five clones were obtained. Based on their restriction maps, the obtained clones could be classified into two groups: four clones (pH1-pH4) and one clone (pS4a). Fig. 1 shows the growth phenotype of the yeast mutant transformed with the cloned plasmids. Plasmids pH4 and pS4a clearly suppress the growth defect of strain NA9 on inositol- and ethanolamine-containing medium, although the suppression by pH4 is slightly weaker. Partial sequence analysis revealed that plasmid pH4 contains the cDNA for human choline kinase, which has already been isolated (26Hosaka K. Tanaka S. Nikawa J. Yamashita S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 229-232Google Scholar). On the other hand, plasmid pS4a was found to have a new cDNA. We therefore sequenced the entire region of the new cDNA. A restriction map of the cDNA insert of pS4a is shown in Fig. 2A The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA was determined on both strands. The cDNA insert consisted of a total of 1,856 bases, with a single long open reading frame (ORF) starting with an ATG codon at position 67 and ending at position 1,236 (Fig. 2B). Although it was not known whether translation started at the first methionine shown in Fig. 2B or at a further upstream one, we predicted that the first methionine shown in Fig. 2B is the likely translation start site, as the sequence flanking it conforms to the consensus sequence for translation initiation proposed by Kozak (27Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Google Scholar), (A/G)XXATG(A/G)X(C/T). This was supported by sequence comparison with the yeast ET (see below). The ORF encoded a protein of 389 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 43.8 kDa. As was expected, the reading frame is in-frame with the ADH1 N-terminal region of the expression vector, pADANS. The consensus site for polyadenylation, 5′-AATAAA-3′, is present 579 base pairs after a TAA termination codon. The deduced amino acid sequence for the cDNA coding region was used to search a number of data bases provided by the National Institute of Genetics, Japan. The cDNA gene product was found to be similar to several cytidylyltransferases and found to be most similar (36% identity) to the S. cerevisiae ET (Fig. 3A). The homology extends across the entire lengths of both proteins. It is also noteworthy that both proteins have large internal repeated sequences (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, the sequence similarity between the cDNA gene product and CTs from several species, including from humans, was limited to their N-terminal halves. Limited sequence similarity was also observed at the C termini of human and yeast ET, and yeast CT, but not at the C terminus of human CT (Fig. 3C). These results strongly suggested that the cDNA obtained here is for human ET. We describe below biochemical evidence demonstrating that this is indeed the case. Northern analysis was carried out with a variety of adult human tissues. For this study the entire 2-kbp human cDNA fragment from pS4a was used as a probe. As shown in Fig. 4 a major transcript of approximately 2 kilobases was detected among the RNAs from the several human tissues examined. The size of the transcript is consistent with that of the cDNA obtained. The transcript is very abundant in liver, heart, and skeletal muscle tissues. To confirm that plasmid pS4a contains the cDNA for human ET, we examined whether or not the cDNA could restore the activity of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway in the yeast strain. The flux of ethanolamine through the ET step was analyzed by determining the incorporation of [14C]ethanolamine into PtdEtn. The overall rate of PtdEtn synthesis was determined by measuring the radioactivity in lipids. As shown in Fig. 5 the incorporation of radioactivity in the ect1 mutant was very low. On the other hand, the incorporation of radioactivity into lipids in the mutant strain harboring plasmid pS4a had recovered to 81% (at 60 min) of that in the wild type. It was also shown that the introduction of the human cDNA for choline kinase (plasmid pH4) restored the incorporation of radiolabeled ethanolamine into lipids, although the extent was slightly low (43% of that in the wild type at 60 min). We next analyzed the radioactive lipids derived from 14C-labeled ethanolamine and choline. Cells were cultured with labeled compounds for 60 min and lipids were extracted and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. As shown in Fig. 6 the amount of labeled PtdEtn and PtdCho derived from [14C]ethanolamine was very low in the mutant cells (lane 5) when compared with those in wild-type cells (lane 4). Introduction of human cDNA into the yeast mutant clearly restored the synthesis of PtdEtn and PtdCho from [14C]ethanolamine (lane 6). In contrast, there were no significant differences in the amount of labeled PtdCho derived from [14C]choline between these strains (lanes 1-3). We next examined the incorporation of [14C]ethanolamine into the intermediates of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. The ect1 mutant harboring vector plasmid pADANS and plasmid pS4a, as well as the wild-type strain harboring pADANS were grown at 30°C in the presence of [14C]ethanolamine for 60 min. Trichloroacetic acid-soluble materials were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. As shown in Fig. 7 mutant cells accumulated much higher levels of radioactive phosphoethanolamine than wild-type cells. Conversely, the level of radioactive CDP-ethanolamine was very low in the mutant. Introduction of the human cDNA into the yeast mutant clearly restored the level of CDP-ethanolamine. These results strongly indicate that the cDNA product has ET activity. Further evidence supporting this conclusion was obtained by assaying the ET activity of the cDNA product. ET and CT activities in the transformant were determined and compared with those in the mutant and wild-type cells. As shown in Table I ect1 mutant strain, NA9 having a vector alone, had a very low ET activity, when compared with wild-type strain, DS15-3. On the other hand, the introduction of human cDNA on a multicopy vector into the mutant cell clearly restored the ET activity. The activity was higher than that in wild-type cells. This might be the results of gene dosage effect. CT activity was measured as a control, and we found no significant differences in the enzyme activities between these strains.TABLE I.ET and CT activities in wild-type, mutant, and transformant cellsStrainPlasmidSpecific activityaSpecific activity data are the averages ± standard deviations from four independent experiments.ETCTnmol/min/mg proteinDS15-3None1.13 ± 0.260.87 ± 0.35NA9pADANS0.07 ± 0.051.38 ± 0.03NA9pS4a2.68 ± 0.621.65 ± 0.40a Specific activity data are the averages ± standard deviations from four independent experiments. Open table in a new tab To determine the ET activity of the cDNA product, we expressed its protein product fused with GST in E. coli A SmaI/EcoRI cDNA fragment was subcloned between the SmaI and EcoRI sites of expression vector pGEX-2T. The plasmid, pGEX-hECT, thus obtained resulted in an in-frame fusion between the N-terminal GST coding region and codons 18-390 of the ET coding region (including the stop codon). The construct was transformed into E. coli, and expression of the fusion protein was induced with IPTG. The production of the fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The IPTG-dependent induction of a large amount of the fusion protein was detected (data not shown). The molecular mass of the fusion protein appeared to be about 65 kDa, this being consistent with the calculated value. We next determined the ET activity using [14C]phosphoethanolamine as the substrate and an E. coli cell extract containing the fusion protein as the enzyme source. Reaction products were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and located by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 8 the extract prepared from the pGEX-hECT-harboring E. coli cells cultured in the presence of IPTG contained significant ET activity (lane 2). The activity was dependent on CTP (lane 3) and Mg2+ (lane 4). When a boiled extract or an extract prepared from vector-harboring cells was used as the enzyme source, no activity was detected (lanes 6 and 1, respectively). These results clearly show that the cDNA obtained here is of the structural gene for human ET. We describe here the first isolation and characterization of the cDNA for ET from mammalian cells. The size of the mRNA for ET, as revealed by Northern blot analysis, was almost the same as that of the cDNA. The transcript is very abundant in liver, heart, and skeletal muscle tissues. The high level of expression in liver cells agrees with the fact that liver cells have high ET activity (2Sundler R. Akesson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3359-3367Google Scholar). The deduced polypeptide encoded by the cDNA consists of 389 amino acids with a molecular mass of about 43.8 kDa. This value is slightly less than that of ET purified from rat liver, i.e. approximately 49.5 kDa (11Craig L. Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3311-3317Google Scholar, 12Wieder T. Geilen C.C. Wieprecht M. Becker A. Orfanos C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 207-210Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence of the putative encoded protein shows a high degree of similarity to the yeast ET throughout the entire region. The putative human protein, however, is longer than the yeast protein in both the N- and C-terminal regions, especially at the C-terminal region. The two proteins are functionally similar. Indeed, the introduction of the human cDNA, even in a single copy, restored the growth defect of the yeast ect1 mutant (data not shown). An additional striking structural feature is that human and yeast ETs have a large repetitive sequence in their N-terminal and C-terminal halves, suggesting that the two halves are generated through a gene duplication event. The regions of greatest identity in the two halves of ETs are also homologous to the sequences in the N-terminal half of CTs. Based on the high degree of homology between the N-terminal domain of rat CT, a similarly located region in yeast CT, and a Bacillus subtilis glycerolphosphate cytidylyltransferase (4Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. LaChance A. Aebersold R. Cornell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6029-6033Google Scholar, 8Tsukagoshi Y. Nikawa J. Yamashita S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 477-486Google Scholar, 28Mauel C. Young M. Karawata D. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 929-941Google Scholar), it has been proposed that this region bears the active site of these cytidylyltransferases. This was confirmed by that the catalytic activity of a truncated form of rat CT, comprising residues 1-236, was quite similar to that of the wild-type CT (29Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18948-18952Google Scholar). Therefore, human and yeast ETs might have two catalytic domains, and this might reflect the substrate specificity of the enzyme. Further studies involving structural and functional analyses of ETs are required. In a previous study, we cloned the human cDNA for choline kinase from the same library as used here by complementing the yeast cki1 mutation (26Hosaka K. Tanaka S. Nikawa J. Yamashita S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 229-232Google Scholar). Choline kinase catalyzes the formation of phosphoethanolamine, which is one of the substrates for ET. As shown in Fig. 1 we again obtained the human choline kinase cDNA as a suppressor for the yeast ect1 mutation. It was also shown that the human choline kinase cDNA restored the defect of PtdEtn synthesis via CDP-ethanolamine when introduced into the yeast ect1 mutant (Fig. 5). These results strongly suggest that the introduction of multicopies of the choline kinase gene might result in overproduction of phosphoethanolamine, and the accumulation of phosphoethanolamine could bypass the defect of ect1 through the action of CT. Indeed, this is the case because we found that multicopies of the yeast CKI1 or CCT1 gene can also suppress the growth defect of the ect1 mutant (data not shown). Although phosphoethanolamine is a poor substrate for CT (22Nikawa J. Yonemura K. Yamashita S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 223-229Google Scholar, 30Tsukagoshi Y. Nikawa J. Hosaka K. Yamashita S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2134-2136Google Scholar), elevation of the enzyme activity of CT on introducing multicopies of CCT1 into cells could compensate for the defect of ET activity. Based on the analogy between the CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine pathways, it has long been thought that ET would be regulated in a similar manner to CT. However, more recent studies summarized by Tijburg et al. (15Tijburg L.B.M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 1-19Google Scholar) strongly suggest that, at least in liver, the CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine routes are subject to independent regulation. Further work on thorough comparison of the two cytidylyltransferases and the significance of structural differences that could be relevant for independent regulation of these enzymes are required. The cDNA and the information on the primary structure for ET obtained here will allow us to develop methods for studying the structural and functional relationship between ET and CT, as well as the regulatory mechanism for ET. We thank M. Wigler (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) for the cDNA library."

A major magmatic pulse has recently built a new, swollen segment of the SWIR (Spiess Ridge) that is propagating toward the MAR at a rate of 4 to 5 centimeters per year, disrupting a former ridge-ridge-ridge (RRR) triple junction. A new triple junction will be established about 70 kilometers to the north when the propagating SWIR/Spiess segment will impact with the MAR, probably within the next 1 million years. The American Antarctic Ridge will take advantage of the MAR/SWIR duel by capturing an approximately 70-kilometer stretch of MAR, whereas the Antarctic plate will increase its size."
https://openalex.org/W2080432615,"Shc is phosphorylated on Tyr-317, which serves as a docking site for Grb2. To investigate the specific role of Shc phosphorylation and Shc·Grb2 coupling on insulin signaling, we generated expression vectors for wild-type (WT-Shc) and a mutant Shc with a Tyr-317 → Phe substitution (317Y/F-Shc) and stably transfected them into Rat1 fibroblasts expressing insulin receptors (HIRc). From different clonal cell lines, cells expressing 10 times greater amounts of WT-Shc or 317Y/F-Shc compared with endogenous Shc were chosen for analysis of insulin signaling. Insulin-induced Shc phosphorylation and subsequent association with Grb2 was enhanced in WT-Shc cells. Because of competition between Shc and IRS-1 for interaction with the insulin receptor, insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was decreased in WT-Shc cells compared with that in HIRc cells. Likewise, reduction of endogenous Shc expression by antisense Shc mRNA resulted in increased insulin stimulation of IRS-1 phosphorylation. Although 317Y/F-Shc was also able to interact with insulin receptor, decreased amounts of Shc phosphorylation and Shc association with Grb2 were observed in 317Y/F-Shc cells, indicating that 317Y/F-Shc functions as a dominant-negative mutant. The kinetics of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation closely paralleled the kinetics of Shc phosphorylation. Thus, insulin stimulation of MAP kinase activation occurred more rapidly and was prolonged in WT-Shc cells, while the activation was delayed and transient in 317Y/F-Shc cells compared with that in HIRc cells. Importantly, WT-Shc cells displayed enhanced sensitivity to insulin stimulation of thymidine and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, whereas the sensitivity was decreased in 317Y/F-Shc cells. These results indicate that Shc Tyr-317 phosphorylation plays an important role, via coupling with Grb2 and competition with IRS-1, in signal transduction to MAP kinase by insulin, ultimately leading to mitogenesis in Rat1 fibroblasts.

https://openalex.org/W2152017256,"Using the monoclonal antibody GDA-J/F3, a 50-kDa noncollagenous component of human skin basement membrane zone was identified. Immunofluorescence stainings of normal human skin with the GDA-J/F3 antibody showed a linear fluorescence decorating the basement membrane zone. With immunoelectron microscopy, the epitope was localized to the insertion points of the anchoring fibrils into the lamina densa. The antigen is distinct from collagen VII, from the main structural protein of the anchoring fibrils, and from several other structural molecules of the basement membrane zone, because the GDA-J/F3 antibody did not react with purified basement membrane components in vitro In serum-free cultures, the antigen was synthesized and secreted by normal and transformed human keratinocytes and to a lesser extent by normal human skin fibroblasts. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled epithelial cell-conditioned medium with the GDA-J/F3 antibody yielded two polypeptides that migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with apparent molecular masses of 46 and 50 kDa under nonreducing conditions. Using reducing gels, only the 50-kDa polypeptide was observed. The antigen was resistant to digestion with bacterial collagenase but sensitive to trypsin and pepsin. It also bound to heparin and DEAE cellulose at low ionic strength and alkaline pH. These findings indicate that the GDA-J/F3 antigen is a small globular disulphide-bonded protein with a potential to interact with basement membrane proteoglycans. Integration of the GDA-J/F3 antigen into the histoarchitecture of the dermo-epidermal junction is dependent on the presence of collagen VII, because the GDA-J/F3 epitope was missing in several patients with a genetic blistering disorder of the skin, epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica, who lacked collagen VII and anchoring fibrils. Using the monoclonal antibody GDA-J/F3, a 50-kDa noncollagenous component of human skin basement membrane zone was identified. Immunofluorescence stainings of normal human skin with the GDA-J/F3 antibody showed a linear fluorescence decorating the basement membrane zone.

https://openalex.org/W2086618268,"Signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) proteins play an important role in signaling through a variety of cytokine and growth factor receptors. Each of the Stat proteins is activated in a ligand-specific manner. Only the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of Stat1 and Stat2 are critical for the ligand-specific activation of interferon signaling. In this study we determined the domains in Stat3 protein that contribute to interleukin 6 (IL-6)-specific phosphorylation. Based on evidence that Stat3, but not Stat1, is activated in the presence of low levels of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor, we constructed various swap mutants between Stat3 and Stat1 and examined their response to IL-6 after their transient expression into COS7 cells. The region upstream of the SH2 domain was exchangeable between Stat1 and Stat3, whereas the region carboxyl-terminal to the SH2 domain of Stat3 was critical to phosphorylation by IL-6. However, unlike Stat1 and Stat2 in interferon signaling, the swap mutant in which 5 amino acid residues just carboxyl-terminal to the tyrosine phosphorylation site (Tyr705) in Stat3 was replaced by the corresponding region derived from Stat1 was not phosphorylated in response to IL-6. Substituting 1 amino acid (Lys709) at position +4 relative to Tyr705 abolished the tyrosine phosporylation of Stat3 in response to IL-6. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that these mutants were associated with gp130 at an extent similar to wild-type Stat3. Taken together, these results show that the amino acid residues immediately carboxyl-terminal to the tyrosine phosphorylation site are involved in IL-6-specific activation of Stat3.

Cytokines and growth factors mediate their biological effects through interaction with their receptors.

Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar). The Jak family of known nonreceptor protein kinases consists of Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2. The family of Stat proteins constitutes a new class of transcription factors that contains SH2, SH3-like domains, and a carboxyl-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation site (2Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Google Scholar). Six Stat family members (Stat1-Stat6) have been cloned. Jak kinases associate with the cytoplasmic membrane proximal region of receptors and are catalytically activated after ligand binding. The activated Jak kinases then phosphorylate Stat proteins at their tyrosine residues. Thereafter, the Stat proteins become homodimerized or heterodimerized and translocate to the nucleus to activate transcription by interaction with specific DNA sequences. signal transducers and activators of transcription Janus kinase Src homology interferon interleukin leukemia inhibitory factor epidermal growth factor amino acid(s) The Stat proteins are activated in a ligand-specific manner. In in vitro studies, Stat1 and Stat2 are phosphorylated in response to IFN-α, whereas Stat1, but not Stat2, is phosphorylated in response to IFN-γ.

Stat3 is phosphorylated by stimulation with cytokines using gp130 and gp130-related receptors such as IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, as well as EGF (11Akira S.

Although Stat1 is activated by many cytokines and growth factors, it appears specific for IFN pathways in vivo Stat1−/−embryonic stem cells are unresponsive to IFN but retain responsiveness to LIF and remain LIF-dependent for undifferentiated growth (22Durbin J.E.

To understand how the specificity of the signal is achieved after the interaction of a ligand with the corresponding receptor and subsequent activation of Jak kinases and Stat proteins, the molecular mechanism of their interaction has been investigated. In response to IFN-γ, Stat1 is activated by Jak1 and Jak2. A functionally critical membrane-distal tyrosine residue (Tyr440) in the IFN-γα receptor is a target of activated Jak kinases, and the sequence YpDKPH, containing the phosphotyrosine of the IFN-γ receptor, provides the specific association site for Stat1 (28Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Google Scholar). In IFN-α signaling, Leung et al. showed that Stat1 and Stat2 proteins might be sequentially phosphorylated in response to IFN-α, and that phosphorylated Stat2 might be required, so that unphosphorylated Stat1 can bind to the activated IFN-α receptor (29Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.J. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Google Scholar). For IL-6 signaling, gp130 becomes homodimerized when IL-6 binds the IL-6 receptor (30Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Google Scholar, 31Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamasaki K. Yasukawa K. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1989; 58: 573-581Google Scholar). Dimerization induces intermolecular phosphorylation and activation of the associated Jaks (Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2), which then phosphorylate tyrosines on gp130 (32Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Google Scholar). The box3 region of gp130 contains YXXQ, motifs and it acts as a docking site that selectively binds Stat3, which is in turn phosphorylated by activated Jaks (33Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Google Scholar). Using chimeric constructs between Stat1 and Stat2, Heim et al. (34Heim M.H. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell J.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1347-1349Google Scholar) have shown that the SH2 domain in Stat proteins plays a critical role in their ligand-specific phosphorylation of Stat proteins (34Heim M.H. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell J.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1347-1349Google Scholar). We questioned whether the same is true of other members of the Stat family. Here we performed structure-function analyses of Stat3 by generating a series of swap mutants between Stat3 and Stat1 and identified the region that contributes to the specificity of IL-6-dependent Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation. We confirmed the importance of the SH2 domain in Stat3 and showed that, besides the SH2 domain, the specific activation of Stat3 by IL-6 is determined by the amino acid sequences present just carboxyl-terminal to the tyrosine phosphorylation site. Recombinant human IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor were provided by K. Yasukawa (Toso, Kanagawa, Japan). Recombinant human EGF was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). The antibodies to Flag epitope and to phosphotyrosine were purchased from IBI (New Haven, CT) and Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), respectively. COS cells were grown on plastic culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Myeloid leukemia M1 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with twice the normal concentrations of amino acids and vitamins and 10% fetal calf serum. Some constructs were generated by introducing new restriction enzyme sites, which did not alter the amino acid residue, by the polymerase chain reaction or by site-directed mutagenesis (Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit, Clontech). Other constructs were directly produced by site-directed mutagenesis. The subcloned polymerase chain reaction products were completely sequenced. The constructs were tagged with the Flag epitope (Eastman Kodak Co.) at their NH2 termini and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pEF-BOS (35Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Google Scholar). The amino acid (aa) boundaries of the chimeric proteins were as follows: 3/1A has aa 1-235 of Stat1 and 240-771 of Stat3; 3/1B has aa 1-325 of Stat1 and 330-771 of Stat3; 3/1C has aa 1-443 of Stat1 and 450-771 of Stat3; 3/1D has aa 1-596 of Stat1 and 604-771 of Stat3; 3/1E has aa 326-751 of Stat1 and 1-329 of Stat3; 3/1F has aa 449-751 of Stat1 and 1-453 of Stat3; 3/1G has aa 694-751 of Stat1 and 1-698 of Stat3; 3/1H has aa 701-751 of Stat1 and 1-704 of Stat3; 3/1J has aa 705-715 of Stat3 substituted for 701-711 of Stat1; 3/1K has aa 705-710 of Stat3 substituted for 701-706 of Stat1; and 3/1L has aa 711-715 of Stat3 substituted for 707-711 of Stat1. Y705F was generated by site-directed mutagenesis converting the tyrosine 705 of Stat3 to phenylalanine, and K709E was generated converting lysine 709 of Stat3 to glutamate. COS cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method and cultured for 48 h in complete media before being deprived of serum for 5 h. The cells were then incubated for 15 min with cytokines or growth factors, and then the cells were lysed for immunoprecipitation. M1 cells were transfected via electroporation with the expression vector and pSV2neo at a 20:1 ratio, and neomycin-resistant clones were selected in growth medium containing 750 mg/ml of Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were solubilized with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1.0% Nonidet P-40 and 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.6, containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) and then centrifuged. The clarified lysates were incubated with 10 μg of M2 anti-Flag monoclonal antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and then immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with M2 or anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody. Blots were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's procedures. We assessed the dose of IL-6 required to phosphorylate Stat1 and Stat3. To discriminate exogenous and endogenous Stats, we constructed expression vectors for Stat1 and Stat3, both of which were Flag epitope-tagged on their amino termini. These vectors were transiently transfected into COS cells and stimulated with increasing concentrations of IL-6 together with soluble IL-6 receptor. The cells were then lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Fig. 1A shows that at an IL-6 concentration of 25 ng/ml, Stat3 was already fully phosphorylated, whereas Stat1 was not at all or only weakly phosphorylated. As the concentration of IL-6 increased, Stat1 phosphorylation was augmented in a dose-dependent manner, although the amount of phosphorylation at 300 ng/ml IL-6 was still significantly lower than that of Stat3 at 25 ng/ml. In contrast, Stat3 was maximally phosphorylated at 25 ng/ml IL-6. These results demonstrated that only Stat3 is activated at a low concentration of IL-6, although Stat1 is activated at a very high concentration. Therefore, we used 25 ng/ml IL-6 to stimulate COS cells in the following experiments. We also examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type Stat3 and Stat1 in response to EGF. Both Stat3 and Stat1 were phosphorylated in COS cells exposed to EGF (Fig. 1B). To determine which domains contribute to the IL-6-specific activation of Stat3 protein, we constructed several swap mutants at conserved amino acids between Stat3 and Stat1, termed 3/1A-3/1D (Fig. 2). In construct 3/1A, the amino-terminal region of Stat3 was substituted by the comparable region of Stat1. The constructs 3/1B and 3/1C contained Stat1 residues in place of Stat3 aa 1-329 and 1-449, respectively. In the construct 3/1D, the substituted region at aa 1-596 encompassed the region from the amino terminus to part of the SH2 domain. These constructs were transiently transfected into COS cells stimulated with IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor or EGF. Then we examined phosphorylation. Fig. 3 shows that IL-6 and EGF activated all the constructs in which the region from the amino-terminal to the upper half of the SH2 domain was substituted by the corresponding region of Stat1. These results showed that the amino-terminal region upstream of the SH2 domain is exchangeable between Stat1 and Stat3.Fig. 3The region upstream of the SH2 domain is exchangeable between Stat1 and Stat3. COS-7 cells were transfected with wild-type Stat3, Stat1, and the chimeric Stat3/1 proteins described in Fig. 2. Serum-deprived cells were incubated for 15 min at 37°C with or without 25 ng/ml recombinant human IL-6 and 25 ng/ml soluble recombinant human IL-6 receptor. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with the anti-Flag antibody M2. Immunoprecipitates were Western blotted using the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (top panel) or the anti-Flag antibody M2 (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine the role of SH2 domains in the ligand-specific phosphorylation of Stat3 and Stat1, we constructed swap mutants in which the carboxyl-terminal regions of Stat3 were replaced by the comparable regions of Stat1 (Fig. 4). In the construct 3/1E, the carboxyl-terminal region containing the DNA binding domain (aa 330-771) of Stat3 was substituted by that of Stat1. In the construct 3/1F, the region containing the SH3 and downstream domains (aa 454-771) was replaced by that of Stat1. Fig. 5 shows that IL-6 did not activate the 3/1E and 3/1F mutants. In contrast, EGF phosphorylated both of them. Together with the results shown in Fig. 3 these data indicated that the carboxyl-terminal region containing the SH2 and its downstream domains provide the specificity for Stat3 phosphorylation mediated by IL-6 but not by EGF.Fig. 5The region carboxyl-terminal to the SH2 domain of Stat3 is important for phosphorylation by IL-6 but not by EGF. COS-7 cells were transfected with the chimeric Stat3/1 proteins described in Fig. 4. Cells were stimulated without (−) or with recombinant human IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (6) or recombinant human EGF (E) as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with the anti-Flag antibody M2. Immunoprecipitates were Western blotted using the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (top panel) or the anti-Flag antibody M2 (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We and other groups have demonstrated that the SH2 domain is critical for Stat3 phosphorylation because a single amino acid substitution of arginine to glutamine in the SH2 domain completely abolished Stat3 phosphorylation. We examined whether only the SH2 domain is sufficient for IL-6-specific phosphorylation. We constructed the swap mutant, 3/1G, in which the region carboxyl-terminal to the SH2 domain (aa 699-771) was replaced by that of Stat1 (Fig. 4). IL-6 did not phosphorylate this mutant (Fig. 5). Even when the replaced region (aa 705-771) was narrowed at the tyrosine residue to be phosphorylated, Tyr705 (this mutant is named 3/1H), IL-6 did not activate the mutant. However, when the swap site was placed 5 amino acids carboxyl-terminal to Tyr705 (aa 710), the mutant was phosphorylated. These data suggested that the carboxyl-terminal boundary of the critical region for IL-6-specific Stat3 phosphorylation lies within the 5 amino acid residues carboxyl-terminal to Tyr705. To determine the amino acid residues critical for the IL-6-specific phosphorylation of Stat3, we constructed the swap mutants 3/1J, 3/1K, and 3/1L (Fig. 6A). The corresponding Stat1 residues were substituted for the tyrosine phosphorylation site and the downstream 10 amino acid residues (aa 705-715) of Stat3 in 3/1J. The 5 amino acids critical for the IL-6-specific phosphorylation of Stat3 (aa 706-710) were replaced by the corresponding region of Stat1 in 3/1K. Five downstream amino acids (aa 711-715) adjacent to the critical 5 amino acids were replaced by the corresponding region of Stat1 in 3/1L. Fig. 6B shows that EGF and IL-6 phosphorylated 3/1L, whereas only EGF phosphorylated 3/1J and 3/1K. The amino acid difference between the 5 amino acids critical for IL-6-specific phosphorylation of Stat3 and the corresponding 5 amino acids of Stat1 consists of 3 residues: +1 (Leu → Ile), +4 (Lys → Glu), and +5 (Phe → Leu). Since the substitution at +4 seemed to cause the biggest difference, we changed +4 lysine to glutamate in Stat3 by site-directed mutagenesis (mutant K709E). EGF, but not IL-6, phosphorylated this mutant. Therefore, the +4 lysine is necessary for the IL-6-specific activation of Stat3. To exclude the possibility that these results were specific to COS cells, we generated permanent M1 clones that harbor wild-type Stat3 and several swap mutant expression vectors. M1 is a mouse myeloid leukemia cell line that differentiates into macrophages in response to IL-6. M1 cells did not respond to EGF, but wild-type Stat3 and 3/1L were phosphorylated by stimulation with IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor whereas, 3/K was not (Fig. 7). As in COS cells, the 5 amino acid residues carboxyl-terminal to Tyr705 were critical for the IL-6-specific phosphorylation of Stat3 in M1 cells. To examine the reason why IL-6 did not tyrosine phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal swap mutants in response to IL-6, we studied their association with gp130. COS cells were co-transfected with the expression vectors for wild-type Stat3 or its mutants and a gp130 expression vector. After stimulation with IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody and then blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-Flag antibodies, respectively (Fig. 8). Anti-Flag antibody co-precipitated gp130 in COS cells transfected with the vector expressing wild-type Stat3, indicating that wild-type Stat3 associates with gp130. In COS cells transfected with the vector expressing wild-type Stat1 and stimulated with IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor, Stat1 was neither phosphorylated nor associated with gp130. In contrast, all the swap mutants, 3/1J, 3/1K, 3/1L, and K709E, co-immunoprecipitated gp130, although only 3/1L was phosphorylated, as shown in Fig. 6B (Fig. 8). These results indicate that the 5 amino acid residues carboxyl-terminal to Tyr705 that were critical for the IL-6-specific phosphorylation did not play a role in the association with gp130. There is some discrepancy among studies of Stat protein activation by IL-6 treatment. Some have shown that only Stat3 is activated (11Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.J. Wei S. Matsusaka T. Yoshida K. Sudo T. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Google Scholar, 13Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell J.J. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Google Scholar), whereas others have found that both Stat3 and Stat1 are activated (36Feldman G.M. Petricoin III., E. David M. Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10747-10752Google Scholar, 37Lutticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Science. 1994; 263: 89-92Google Scholar). In addition to IFNs, Stat1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by many factors, such as EGF, platelet-derived growth factor, LIF, IL-6, IL-10, colony-stimulating factor 1, and angiotensin. However, the doses of these factors were not considered in these studies. In this study, Stat transient expression in COS cells and immunoblotting showed that only Stat3 is phosphorylated at low concentrations of IL-6, whereas high concentrations activated both Stat3 and Stat1. The dose-dependent selectivity of Stat activation has been shown by means of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (6Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Google Scholar). In HepG2 cells at a low IL-6 concentration, SIF-A (a Stat3 homodimer) was the predominant DNA binding complex induced, whereas at higher IL-6 concentrations, SIF-B (a Stat3 and Stat1 heterodimer) and SIF-C (a Stat1 homodimer) were also formed. Although Stat1 is activated by IL-6, Stat3 plays a critical role in the biological effects exerted by IL-6. In myeloid leukemia M1 cells that undergo terminal differentiation and growth arrest in response to IL-6, overexpression of the dominant negative forms of Stat3 prevented both growth arrest and terminal differentiation (38Minami M. Inoue M. Wei S. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3963-3966Google Scholar, 39Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Google Scholar). On the contrary, despite its activation by factors other than IFNs, Stat1 is essential for IFN signaling, because Stat1-deficient mice display a complete lack of responsiveness to either IFN-α or IFN-γ but respond normally to other cytokines that activate Stat1 in vitro (22Durbin J.E. Hackenmiller R. Simon M.C. Levy D.E. Cell. 1996; 84: 443-450Google Scholar, 23Meraz M. White J.M. Sheehan K.C.F. Bach E.A. Rodig S.J. Dighe A.S. Kaplan D.H. Riley J.K. Greenlund A.C. Campbell D. Carver-Moore K. DuBois R.N. Clark R. Aguet M. Schreiber R.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 431-442Google Scholar). To date, how Stat1 is activated at high concentrations of IL-6 and what the function of Stat1 is in IL-6 signaling remain to be clarified. We and other investigators showed that gp130 is immunoprecipitated by activated Stat3 but not by Stat1, even when phosphorylated at high concentrations of IL-6 (data not shown). Stat1 may be activated by forming a heterodimer with Stat3 through docking to Stat3 phosphotyrosine, as demonstrated by the activation of Stat1 in IFN-α signaling (29Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.J. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Google Scholar). Alternatively, Stat1 may associate with gp130 in such a degree that recruitment cannot be detectable by immunoprecipitation assay (40Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmann U. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12991-12998Google Scholar) or may directly associate with activated Jak kinases and become phosphorylated. In fact, Gupta et al. (41Gupta S. Yan H. Wong L.H. Ralph S. Krolewski J. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1075-1084Google Scholar) have reported that the Stat1 SH2 domain mediates an obligate interaction with the Jak kinases, indicating that overstimulation causes the direct binding of Stat1 with Jak protein kinases and subsequent phosphorylation by Jaks. Furthermore, very high erythropoietin levels activate Stat5 even when an erythropoietin receptor mutant lacks all intracellular tyrosines (42Damen J.E. Wakao H. Miyajima A. Krosl J. Humphries R.K. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5557-5568Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region is conserved in Stat proteins and has multiple functions. The amino terminus of Stat1 is important in modulating its phosphorylation, possibly by interacting with a phosphatase (43Shuai K. Liao J. Song M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4932-4941Google Scholar). The domain also contributes to the co-operative DNA binding and enables the Stat proteins to recognize variations of the consensus site (44Xu X. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of Stat1 lacking the amino-terminal conserved region were not phosphorylated by IFN-α or IFN-γ, and the helical repeat within their amino-terminal regions is necessary for Stat1 phosphorylation (45Qureshi S.A. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 288-293Google Scholar, 46Improta T. Schindler C. Horvath C.M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4776-4780Google Scholar). Our findings that these regions are exchangeable between Stat3 and Stat1 suggested that the amino-terminal region does not function as a specificity determinant in their phosphorylation. In this study, we showed that the carboxyl-terminal region, including the SH2 domain, determines the specificity between Stat3 and Stat1. Heim et al. (34Heim M.H. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell J.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1347-1349Google Scholar) have also demonstrated that the SH2 domain plays a critical role in the selective activation of Stat1 and Stat2 in response to IFNs. Changing the Stat1 SH2 domain to that of Stat2 prevented IFN-γ activation, whereas changing the SH2 domain of Stat2 to that of Stat1 allowed phosphorylation by IFN-γ. It is most probable that the exchange of the SH2 domains altered the specific association of Stat proteins with the receptor complexes. In fact, the SH2 domain of each Stat protein interacts with a specific amino acid sequence containing phosphotyrosines in the receptors. The consensus sequence YXXQ in the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 is the critical determinant by which Stat3 is activated (33Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Google Scholar). The consensus sequence (Y440DKP) of the IFN-γα-chain may provide a binding site for Stat1 (28Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Google Scholar). Stat6 binds two tyrosine phosphopeptides (GYPKAFS and GYPKPFQ) derived from the intracellular domain of the IL-4 receptor α-chain. Heim et al. (34Heim M.H. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell J.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1347-1349Google Scholar) demonstrated in the same study that the Stat1 chimeric constructs harboring the Stat2 sequence surrounding the tyrosine phosphorylation site can be normally activated in response to IFN-α or IFN-γ. Therefore, they concluded that swapping the tyrosine phosphorylation site and its surrounding amino acids between Stat1 and Stat2 did not change the specificity of activation by IFN-α and IFN-γ. However, this study showed that the amino acid sequence carboxyl-terminal to Tyr705 in Stat3 contributes to IL-6-specific Stat3 activation. The chimeric protein in which the amino acid sequence immediately carboxyl-terminal to Tyr705 in Stat3 was replaced by the corresponding sequence derived from Stat1 was associated with gp130 but not activated, indicating that the SH2 domain is sufficient for Stat3 to bind gp130 but some additional factors are required for the phosphorylation of Stat3. When overexpressed, Jaks equally activate all Stat proteins without ligand stimulation, so the Jak kinase has been regarded as having no specificity for substrate between Stat families (47Yan H. Krishnan K. Greenlund A.C. Gupta S. Lim J.T.E. Schreber H.D. Schindler C. Krolewski J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1064-1074Google Scholar, 48Quelle F.W. Thierfelder W. Witthuhn B.A. Tang B. Cohen S. Ihle J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20775-20780Google Scholar). We also confirm that our recombinant Stat3/1 proteins were all activated by co-expressed Jak1 (data not shown). In the case of receptor-mediated phosphorylation, some topological constraints in the receptor-Jak-Stat complex may hinder the access of Stat3/1 to the catalytic domain of Jak kinase. Kirshnan et al. (49Kirshman K. Yan H. Lim J.T. Krolewski J.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 125-133Google Scholar) also showed that there might be some favorable geometry of the receptor-Jak-Stat complex to allow Jaks to phosphorylate Stat2 in IFN-α signaling. All swap mutants between Stat1 and Stat3 were equally associated with the EGF receptor and phosphorylated. Stat1 and Stat3 are both activated through the EGF receptor (4Larner A.C. David M. Feldman G.M. Igarashi K. Hackett R.H. Webb D.S. Sweitzer S.M. Petricoin III, E. Finbloom D.S. Science. 1993; 261: 1730-1733Google Scholar, 6Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Google Scholar, 8Silvennoinen O. Schindler C. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1736-1739Google Scholar, 50Ruff-Jamison S. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Chen K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21933-21935Google Scholar). Studies using the EGF receptor deletion mutants showed that two intracellular tyrosine residues (Tyr1068 and Tyr1086) are necessary for Stat activation (51Coffer P.J. Kruijer W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 74-81Google Scholar) and may provide binding sites for Stats. Although EGF stimulates Jak phosphorylation on tyrosine residues (52Shuai K. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Darnell J.E. Nature. 1993; 366: 580-583Google Scholar), whether the receptor activates Stats directly or through Jaks is in dispute. However a study using Jak1-defective cells has revealed that the kinase activity of the receptor but not Jak1 is critical for Stat activation (53Leaman D.W. Pisharody S. Flickinger T.W. Commane M.A. Schlessinger J. Kerr I.M. Levy D.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 369-375Google Scholar). Thus in EGF both the mechanism of recruitment and phosphorylation might be different from gp130. It remains to be established whether the amino acid sequence surrounding the tyrosine phosphorylation site is required for the activation of other Stats in other cytokine and growth factor signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2000405321,"Abstract Aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA) is a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes one of the final steps in the degradation of N-linked glycoproteins. Here we have analyzed the tissue-specific expression and regulation of the human and mouse AGA genes. We isolated and characterized human and mouse AGA 5′-flanking sequences including the promoter regions. Primer extension assay revealed multiple transcription start sites in both genes, characteristic of a housekeeping gene. The cross-species comparison studies pinpointed an approximately 450-base pair (bp) homologous region in the distal promoter. In the functional analysis of human AGA 5′ sequence, the critical promoter region was defined, and an additional upstream region of 181 bp exhibiting an inhibitory effect on transcription was identified. Footprinting and gel shift assays indicated protein binding to the core promoter region consisting of two Sp1 binding sites, which were sufficient to produce basal promoter activity in the functional studies. The results also suggested the binding of a previously uncharacterized transcription factor to a 23-bp stretch in the inhibitory region."
