These fibrils with an antiparallel, beta-pleated sheet conformation consist of only a portion of the variable region of the immunoglobulin light polypeptide chain and share the physical properties of amyloid fibrils. The relation between amyloidosis and immunoglobulins is thus more firmly established and a pathogenetic mechanism for amyloid fibril formation is suggested."

https://openalex.org/W2016549521,"In this age so concerned with travel in outer as well as inner-space, it is strange that, while we have detailed charts of the moon, we have no cartography of the varieties of human experience. In order to draft a map of inner space, I am ready to be your travel guide and take you on two voyages: one along the perceptionhallucination continuum of increasing ergotropic (1) arousal, which includes creative, psychotic, and ecstatic experiences; and another along the perceptionmeditation continuum of increasing trophotropic (1) arousal, which encompasses the hypoaroused states of Zazen and Yoga samadhi. Along the perception-hallucination continuum of increasing arousal of the sympathetic nervous system (ergotropic arousal), man--the self-referential system--perceptually-behaviorally (cortically) interprets the change (drug-induced or natural) in his subcortical activity as creative, psychotic, and ecstatic experiences (2). These states are marked by a gradual turning inward toward a mental dimension at the expense of the physical. The normal state of daily routine, our point of departure, is followed by an aroused, creative state, which can be characterized by an increase in both data content (a description of space) and rate of data processing [flood of inner sensation' (3), or most intense time (4)]. However, in the next aroused state on the continuum, acute schizophrenic [or rather hyperphrenic (5)] state, further increase in data content may not be matched by a corresponding increase in the rate of data processing. While the creative state is conducive to the evolution of novel relations and new meaning, the psychotic jammed computer state interferes with the individual's creative interpretation of the activity of his central nervous system (CNS). At the peak of ecstatic rapture, the outside (physical) world retreats to the fringe of"
https://openalex.org/W2066955143,"I have indicated here some features of a kind of entity which I have called a cultural identity system, and I have focused on a variety of this general type-the persistent system. In general terms it is best described as a system of beliefs and sentiments concerning historical events. I suggest using the term ""a people"" for the human beings who, at any given time, hold beliefs of this kind. These are phenomena with which we have been long familiar, but they have not been systematically studied by any but a few investigators. I have emphasized that a persistent system is a cumulative cultural phenomenon, an open-ended system that defines a course of action for the people believing in it. Such peoples are able to maintain continuity in their experience and their conception of themselves in a wide variety of sociocultural environments. I hold that certain kinds of identifiable conditions give rise to this type of cultural system. These may best be summarized as an oppositional process involving the interactions of individuals in the environment of a state or a similar large-scale organization. The oppositional process frequently produces intense collective consciousness and a high degree of internal solidarity. This is accompanied by a motivation for individuals to continue the kind of experience that is ""stored"" in the identity system in symbolic form. The persistent identity system is more stable as a cultural structure than are large-scale political organizations. When large-scale states disintegrate, they often appear to decompose into cultural systems of the persistent type. Large-scale organizations also give rise to the kind of environment that can result in the formation of new persistent systems. It is possible that, while being formed, states depend for their impetus on the accumulated energy of persistent peoples. A proposition for consideration is that states tend to dissipate the energy of peoples after transforming that energy into state-level integrations, and then regularly break down in the absence of mechanisms for maintaining human motivations in the large-scale organizations that they generate."

https://openalex.org/W2108907493,"All measures of growth whether population, gross national product, waste loads, or demand for recreation suggest that demands on country9s water resources are increasing at a rate that exceeds rate of installation of waste treatment facilities (Fig. 9). Presumably it is these demands which constitute customary measure of and upon which prophesies are made regarding condition of resource and its future prospects. Pressures posed by population and growth must have an effect on river systems which, even with regulation, have finite assimilative or carrying capacity for wastes of different kinds. At outset, then, one might assume, even in absence of proof, that very large increase in society9s activities should have recognizable consequences. Unfortunately, it is easier to estimate potential demand on a river system than it is to measure effect. Certainly many rivers of United States, like rivers in Illinois, Colorado, and other places cited here, are not as they were 70 years ago. Nevertheless, while we know that conditions must be getting worse, we are hard-pressed to determine precisely relation between pressures posed by society and responses of river system. To a large extent observations of condition of river systems have been confined to measures of of flow itself and exclude descriptions of bed, banks, and environs of river. In some instances parameters observed, for example, dissolved oxygen or coliform organisms, are surrogates for broader effects of greater interest. Although useful, they provide only partial measures of river9s condition or assimilative capacity (45). Thus in Hudson River, while it can be shown that change in dissolved oxygen is exceedingly small since 1922, we have some reason to believe that dissolved oxygen inadequately describes accumulating sludge on bottom of river as well as increasing growth of algae. Many years ago Henderson (46) demonstrated that a portion of Shenandoah River was virtually devoid of life despite high oxygen levels and other standards of water. Intended to surmount this disability, current attempts to quantify biological observations may not in fact do so unless they are associated with true biological surveys (47). Observation programs continue to emphasize measures of water to virtual exclusion of measurements of river (48). Observational programs appear to be particularly weak with regard to detection of subtle initial changes from a natural to a polluted condition. This is not to suggest that no such observations are being made, for example on wild rivers, but rather that there is no systematic program for detection of initial changes. The initiation and progression of change are often considered impossible to prevent and inexorable in character. This leads further to view that virtually all changes from a pristine to a used condition are irreversible. Such does not appear to be case. Experience on Ohio River described above, reversal of changes in surfactant concentrations in Illinois River, and marked reduction of sediment in Schuylkill River illustrate that it is possible to reverse or to improve conditions of some rivers with respect to important pollutants. Fish may migrate rapidly to formerly polluted areas when either industrial shutdowns or large cleanup programs occur. The Thames River near London is reported to have fish for first time in very many decades as a result of a major pollution control program. Indeed, a brief report suggests  that condition of rivers in England and Wales . . . may well have improved since 1958 (49). Because evidence up to now does indicate that pressure on water resources posed by population and industrial growth significantly exceeds rate of investment in control facilities, much higher cost must be incurred if even a rough parallelism between development and control is to be achieved. More important, kind of technology that will be needed is not only more expensive, but may be distinctly different in kind from secondary treatment that is now projected for most municipal areas. Even if treatment or pollution control were to maintain parity with pollution pressure, there is good reason to believe that many would continue to hold to definition that  pollution is that which is getting worse. In eyes of beholders (50), sights and smells of rivers today may be considered unsatisfactory, and while quality of rivers may be unchanged, they will be viewed as being polluted and becoming more so, as interests of those living in more crowded areas turn toward rivers to satisfy their recreational and esthetic needs. Many observers have noted historic changes in values in environment, and there is reason to believe that these play no small part in current scene (51). The paucity of information and handful of investigators concerned with evaluating trends in of rivers of United States suggest some specific conclusions. First, none of observational programs were designed specifically to measure of rivers or river environment. The sampling programs emphasize measurement of specific characteristics primarily related to water use by industry and municipalities. The new National Water Quality Network should improve on this single objective orientation (52). Few observational programs combine necessary hydrology with measurements of water quality, river characteristics, and biology. While some long-term observations exist, lack of coordinate observations makes longterm comparisons virtually impossible. For this reason, one must resort to selected or case method described here. In addition, as Dworsky and Strandberg (53) emphasize, interpretation is the vital part of task of water assessment. Such interpretation requires knowledge and skill of analysts familiar both with data and with changing characteristics of land use and economy of drainage basin. The new emphasis on of environment demands continuing assessment and interpretation. A second conclusion from available data suggests that surrogate measures of river and water as wellas a multiplicity of measurements of easily measured parameters may shed little light on dynamics of processes active in river systems and hence such measures may be of limited use in estimating likelihood of reversing specific observed trends in absence of a knowledge of their causes. Additional attention must be given to measurement of parameters related to models of river behavior and to estimates of inputs based on budgets of materials derived from industrial outputs and land use. Third, while hydrologists have long been concerned with variability of flow of natural rivers, because of difficulty of observation, much less attention has been given to variability of biological activity as well as physical variability associated with natural variations and cycles in rivers. Many measurements of biological effects are done during low and summer flows where measurement is easy, organisms often flourish, and concentrations of various substances in flow are high. The effect of winter flow on growth of slimes on bottom of rivers, for example, and special significance to flora and fauna of periodic floods are not well documented. Significantly, however, among most common trends in river management is progressive regulation of flow through provision of storage. Conceivably regulation rather than pollutants alone may have most far-reaching effects on character of many river systems. To date, observations have not been designed to measure these effects. Because demands on waters of rivers of country are increasing, concept of threshold and irreversibility must be studied on (i) pristine waters to disclose nature of initial, presumably biological, changes which take place and (ii) specific rivers where large scale control or cleanup programs have been initiated. It may well be that observations designed to detect polluters, that is, observations designed to support enforcement of standards, may not in themselves provide satisfactory measures of thresholds, trends, or reversals of trends. If one is to judge effectiveness of expenditure of large sums of money, observational tools must be designed to evaluate response of rivers to these expenditures."
https://openalex.org/W1999751392,"The synthesis of adult-type hemoglobin was measured in small samples of peripheral blood cells from 9- to 18-week human fetuses. Hemoglobin indistinguishable from hemoglobin A was identified by ion-exchange chromatography, electrophoresis at pH 8.6, tryptic peptide analysis, and the insensitivity of its synthesis to the action of O-methylthreonine. Synthesis of hemoglobin A accounted for 8 to 14 percent of total hemoglobin synthesis and was demonstrated in as little as 10 microliters of fetal blood. These studies provide sensitive methods for the detection of beta chain types in hemoglobin synthesized by the human fetus at midtrimester. If methods to obtain small quantities of fetal blood at midtrimester become available, these techniques should be applicable to the antenatal detection of sickle cell anemia and related hemoglobinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2079822498,"When normal human cells, capable of repairing ultraviolet-induced lesions in their DNA, are incubated in the thymidine analog 5-bromodeoxyuridine after ultraviolet irradiation, the analog is incorporated into the repaired regions. When such repaired cells are subsequently irradiated with 313-nanometer radiation and placed in alkali, breaks appear in the DNA at sites of incorporation of 5bromodeoxyuridine, inducing a dramatic downward shift in the sedimentation constant of the DNA. Cells from patients with the disease xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes sensitivity to ultraviolet, are incapable or only minimally capable of repair; such cells incorporate little 5-bromodeoxyuridine into their DNA under these conditions and, upon 313-nanometer irradiation and sedimentation in alkali, exhibit only minor shifts in DNA sedimentation constants. When fibroblasts developed from biopsies of normal skin and of skin from patients with xeroderma pigmentosum, as well as cells cultured from midtrimester amniotic fluid, were assayed in this fashion unequivocal differences between normal and xeroderma pigmentosum cells were shown. Xeroderma pigmentosum heterozygotes are clearly distinguishable from homozygous mutants, and results are available 12 hours after irradiation."

The rate of catabolism decreases progressively in the course of nutritional iron deficiency, reaching about 60 percent of control values in 3 weeks. Feeding with iron yields control levels within 6 days. The catabolism of amyl alcohol, which shares a common pathway with n-pentylamine by way of valeric aldehyde, is not significantly affected by the deficiency. The results demonstrate that the maintenance of normal monoamine oxidase activity in vivo depends upon an adequate supply of dietary iron."

The receptors were spontaneously active in darkness and responded without saturation over a light intensity range of 1010 to 1. When the eye was excised, the receptors did not discharge in darkness and had an intensity range of 105 to 1, as is usually found. Experiments show that these and other differences result from cutting off the blood supply to the eye when it is excised. In addition, the range and shape of the intensity characteristic suggest that more than one receptor mechanism encodes light intensity in this eye."
https://openalex.org/W2044649032,An interaction between DDT and lecithin is indicated by the reciprocal effects of each compound on the proton magnetic resonance spectrum of the other. The phosphoryl choline moiety of the lecithin and the benzylic proton of the DDT seem to be involved. The most pronounced response in the proton magnetic resonance spectrum of the lecithin produced by increasing concentration s of DDT was a change in the chemical shift of the resonance peak due to the protons of the choline methyl groups. Increasing concentrations of lecithin produced changes in the chemical shift of the resonance peaks of the benzylic proton and adjacent ring protons of the DDT. Equilibrium constant of 0.597 +/-0.015 molal(-1) was obtained for this interaction.

https://openalex.org/W2065334104,"The differential effects of phenothiazine medication on auditory signal detection performance were compared in two types of schizophrenic subjects and in normal subjects. With increasing phenothiazine dosage a decrease in efficiency of signal detection performance occurred among nonparanoid schizophrenics and an increase in efficiency occurred among paranoid schizophrenics. These and related findings were interpreted in terms of differences in neuropsychological response and information processing characteristics in the two types of schizophrenics. The primary deficit in information processing in nonparanoid schizophrenics may be related primarily to their hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli, whereas in paranoids it may be related primarily to their impaired focusing of attention. Phenothiazines appear to decrease sensitivity to stimuli in nonparanoids but increase the ability to focus attention in paranoids. The possibility of treatment regimens which take into account the differential effects of phenothiazine medication was suggested."

https://openalex.org/W2049116755,"Energy levels exist in mammalian cells which result in the absorption of microwaves between 66 and 76 gigahertz. Many of these energy levels occur when water molecules associate with the various chemical groups of macromolecules. The absorption spectra of cells between 66 and 76 gigahertz, therefore, is determined by the structure of in vivo water lattices, and these seem to reflect indirectly the structural makeup of macromolecules or macromolecular complexes. Tumor cells absorb 66-, 68-, and 70-gigahertz microwaves less strongly and 69-, 72-, and 75-gigahertz microwaves more strongly than normal cells. These differences in the strength of attenuation at each frequency suggest that either the ratio of RNA to DNA or the relative number of certain types of chemical groups in tumor cells is different from that in normal cells."
