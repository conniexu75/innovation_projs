https://openalex.org/W1492555480,"A novel Mr 28,000 integral membrane protein (28kDa) was identified in human erythrocytes and found entirely associated with the Triton X-100 insoluble membrane skeletons. Antibodies to 28kDa reacted strongly on immunoblots with 28kDa and a diffuse region of Mr 35,000-60,000 (HMW-28kDa). Selective proteolytic digestions of membranes demonstrated that HMW-28kDa has an extracellular domain, and both 28kDa and HMW-28kDa have intracellular domains. 28kDa and HMW-28kDa were purified to homogeneity. Quantitative immunoblots indicate that each erythrocyte contains 120,000-160,000 copies of 28kDa. Two-dimensional iodopeptide maps of 28kDa and HMW-28kDa were nearly identical; peptide-N-glycosidase digestion of purified HMW-28kDa demonstrated that it is the N-glycosylated form of 28kDa. When concentrated, 28kDa formed a series of larger oligomers which were stable in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Of several nonerythroid tissues studied with anti-28kDa immunoblots, only kidney displayed immunoreactive 28kDa. Purified rat kidney 28kDa was nearly identical to rat erythrocyte 28kDa when compared by two-dimensional iodopeptide mapping. Immunohistochemical staining of human kidney with anti-28kDa demonstrated prominent staining over the apical brush borders of proximal convoluted tubules. A novel integral membrane protein has been purified from erythrocyte and kidney membranes. This new protein may play a role in linkage of the membrane skeleton to the lipid bilayer."

It has been hypothesized that certain RNA molecules associated with polar granules may be necessary for pole cell determination. Using a monoclonal antibody (Mab46F11) against polar granules, we have cloned the gene for one of their components. This gene turns out to be vasa, which is required maternally for the formation of polar granules and germ cells. This polar granule component shows significant sequence similarity to elF-4A, a translation initiation factor that binds to mRNA, and to other helicases."
https://openalex.org/W1978680674,"Replication of the approximately 200 tandem copies of yeast ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) is known to be initiated within a subset of the repeats, with transcription continuing during the replication process. To examine replication fork movement in this gene cluster, we used a two-dimensional (2D) agarose gel electrophoresis procedure that distinguishes molecules with different branched structures. Replication forks move through most of the rDNA in the same direction in which RNA polymerase I transcribes the 35S rRNA precursor: the 3' end of this transcription unit acts as a barrier to replication forks moving in the direction opposite to RNA polymerase I. The replication fork barrier (RFB) is observed as the accumulation of branched intermediates of specific size. We propose that the act of transcription may influence the movement of replication forks, creating barriers at the 3' ends of actively transcribed genes."

https://openalex.org/W2050692858,"Copper homeostasis in yeast involves a copper binding protein, metallothionein, and a trans-acting regulatory protein that activates transcription of the metallothionein gene in response to copper ions. We show that the regulatory protein specifically binds to the metallothionein gene control sequences in the presence, but not in the absence, of copper. Both the DNA binding and metalloregulatory functions of the transacting factor are contained within its aminoterminal domain, and partial proteolysis experiments show that copper activates this domain by causing a major switch in its conformation. Silver also activates the DNA binding domain in vitro and induces metallothionein gene transcription in vivo. We propose a novel copper cluster model for the DNA binding domain based on its surprising structural similarities to metallothionein itself."
https://openalex.org/W2071595697,"Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is a member of a family of growth factors, each of which supports the proliferation and development of hematopoietic precursors in culture. Although the biologic effects of the different hematopoietic growth factors have been well documented in different culture systems, it has only recently become possible to study the activities of these molecules in vivo. In comparison with the later acting hematopoietic growth factors granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, IL-3 elicited a delayed and relatively modest leukocytosis when continuously infused intravenously in primates. The IL-3 infusion, however, greatly potentiated the responsiveness of the animal to subsequent administration of a low dose of GM-CSF. These results suggest that IL-3 expands an early cell population in vivo that subsequently requires the action of a later acting factor such as GM-CSF to complete its development. Optimal stimulation of hematopoiesis may be achieved with combinations of hematopoietic growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1976289976,"Patients who have received many transfusions become highly sensitized and develop antibodies against almost all HLA alloantigens, so that finding a cross-match negative kidney donor is difficult. A survey of those patients showed that 50 percent did not form antibodies against the noninherited maternal HLA antigens. Apart from the obvious clinical implications, the data indicate that a human equivalent of murine neonatal or actively acquired tolerance has now been identified."
https://openalex.org/W2123191404,"The biosynthesis of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RUBISCO) provides a model system for studying the coordination of nuclear and organelle gene expression, since this abundantly transcribed and expressed chloroplast enzyme is composed of small (SS) and large subunits (LS) encoded by a nuclear multigene family and a single chloroplast gene, respectively. We have tested the possibility that SS mRNA or protein levels affect LS mRNA amounts or LS protein production and accumulation. We find that expression of antisense DNA sequences for the SS in transgenic tobacco plants drastically reduces the accumulation of SS mRNA and SS protein. These changes are accompanied by corresponding reductions of LS protein but not LS mRNA amounts; accumulation of the LS protein appears to be regulated by translational and posttranslational factors. We also find that the transgenic plants display striking variations in growth that are correlated with antisense gene dosage."
https://openalex.org/W1547976855,"The ATP-binding component (Component II, hereafter referred to as ClpA) of a two-component, ATP-dependent protease from Escherichia coli has been purified to homogeneity. ClpA is a protein with subunit Mr 81,000. It has an intrinsic ATPase activity and activates degradation of protein substrates only in the presence of a second component (Component I, hereafter referred to as ClpP), Mg2+, and ATP. The amount of ClpA varies by less than a factor of 2 in cells grown in different media and at temperatures from 30 to 42 degrees C. ClpA does not appear to be a heat-shock protein since its synthesis is not dependent on htpR. Antibodies against purified ClpA were used to identify lambda transducing phage bearing the clpA gene. The cloned gene contains a DNA sequence expected to code for the first 28 amino acids of ClpA, which were determined by protein sequencing of purified ClpA. The clpA gene in the phage was mutated by insertion of delta kan defective transposons and the mutations were transferred to E. coli by homologous recombination. The clpA gene was mapped to 19 min on the E. coli chromosome. Mutant cells with insertions early in the gene produce no ClpA protein detectable in Western blots, and extracts of such mutant cells have no detectable ClpA activity. clpA- mutants grow well under all conditions tested and are not defective in turnover of proteins during nitrogen starvation nor in the turnover of such highly unstable proteins as the lambda proteins O, N, and cII, or the E. coli proteins SulA, RcsA, and glutamate dehydrogenase. The degradation of abnormal canavanine-containing proteins is defective in clpA mutants especially in cells that also have a lon- mutation. Extracts of clpA- lon- cells have ATP-dependent casein degrading activity."
https://openalex.org/W1557198624,"Amyloid deposits occurring in the islets of Langerhans in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and some insulinomas contain a 37-amino acid peptide that is structurally related to calcitonin gene-related peptide. We have identified three cDNA clones encoding islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) or diabetes-associated peptide (DAP) by oligonucleotide screening of a lambda gt10 human insulinoma cDNA library. Two of the three cDNAs contained a domain encoding IAPP/DAP but had an intron-like sequence in their 5' region. The other cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding an 89-amino acid precursor having a typical signal peptide followed by a small prohormone-like sequence containing within it the IAPP/DAP peptide bracketed at its NH2 and COOH termini by Lys-Arg and Gly-Lys-Arg, respectively. These data indicate that this amyloid peptide is generated by proteolytic processing similar to that for proinsulin and other islet prohormones and also that the peptide may be carboxyamidated. The isolation of cDNA clones having 5'-unprocessed intron-like sequences suggests that inefficient or alternative splicing of this mRNA occurred in the insulinoma."
https://openalex.org/W1559639924,"Dolichol phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man) synthase (EC 2.4.1.83) catalyzes the formation of Dol-P-Man from Dol-P and GDP-Man. The structural gene for yeast Dol-P-Man synthase (DPM1) was isolated by screening a yeast genomic DNA library for colonies that overexpressed Dol-P-Man synthase activity. This approach relied on a method to screen for Dol-P-Man synthase activity in lysed yeast colonies and used a yeast mutant with very low Dol-P-Man synthase activity in colony lysates. Transformants isolated using this technique expressed Dol-P-Man synthase activity 9-14-fold higher than that of a wild type strain, and all seven plasmids conferring this overproduction had a common region in their yeast genomic DNA insert. DPM1 is the structural gene for yeast Dol-P-Man synthase since Escherichia coli transformants harboring this gene express Dol-P-Man synthase activity in vitro. DNA sequencing of the DPM1 gene revealed an open reading frame of 801 bases. The 30-kDa size of the predicted protein is in excellent agreement with the size of the purified yeast enzyme (Haselbeck, A., and Tanner, W. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 1520-1524). Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence reveals the protein has a potential membrane spanning domain of 25 amino acids at its COOH terminus. The protein's NH2 terminus, though not hydrophobic, meets existing criteria for yeast signal sequences, but there is no site for cleavage by signal peptidase. If the NH2 terminus is a functional signal sequence, the protein is predicted to be oriented toward the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum with both NH2 and COOH termini serving as membrane anchors. If there is no signal sequence, the enzyme is predicted to face the cytoplasm and be anchored only by its COOH terminus. The DPM1 gene is essential for viability in yeast since disruption of the gene is lethal. We suspect Dol-P-Man synthase is not an essential protein due to its role in N-glycosylation since mutations in other genes that affect the late steps in lipid-linked oligosaccharide synthesis do not affect cell growth. Instead, DPM1 may be an essential gene because its product is required for O-glycosylation in yeast or because Dol-P-Man synthase is needed in some unidentified pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1523300862,"We have tested whether growth factors added to serum-deprived BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts alter the casein kinase II activity measured in cell extracts. A rapid phosphocellulose chromatography method was developed that provides a 40-fold partial purification of casein kinase II activity assayed with the specific substrate peptide Arg-Arg-Glu-Glu-Glu-Thr-Glu-Glu-Glu. Using this technique, kinase activity is stimulated 1.6-2.5-fold when isolated from fibroblasts treated with insulin or insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). The activated kinase activity exhibits the specific properties of casein kinase II such as the ability to utilize [gamma-32P]GTP as phosphate donor and marked inhibition by low concentrations of heparin. Activation of casein kinase II appears specific for these hormones because epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor have no effect on the kinase activity when added to fibroblasts under conditions where they markedly stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Increases of casein kinase II activity by insulin and IGF-I were detected within 1 min of their addition to cell cultures. IGF-I is more potent in stimulating casein kinase II than insulin in mouse fibroblasts. These results demonstrate that casein kinase II is a selective target for insulin and IGF-I action in BALB/c fibroblasts, consistent with the hypothesis that this kinase plays a role in cellular signaling by these hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1980645073,"The mechanism by which the scanning ribosome recognizes the first AUG codon nearest the 5′ end of eukaryotic messenger RNA has not been established. To investigate this an anticodon change (3′-UCC-5′) was introduced into one of the four methionine initiator (tRNAimet) genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ability of the mutant transfer RNA to restore growth properties to his4 initiator codon mutant yeast strains in the absence of histidine was then assayed. Only the complementary codon, AGG, at the his4 initiator region supported His+ growth. The mutant transfer RNA also directed the ribosome to initiate at an AGG placed in the upstream region of the his4 message. Initiation at this upstream AGG precluded initiation at a downstream AGG in accordance with the ""scanning"" model. Therefore, an anticodon: codon interaction between tRNAimet as part of the scanning ribosome and the first AUG must function in directing the ribosome to the eukaryotic initiator region."
https://openalex.org/W1487877558,"The effect of restrictive temperature on ubiquitin conjugation activity has been studied in cells of ts20, a temperature-sensitive cell cycle mutant of the Chinese hamster cell line E36. Ts20 is arrested in early G2 phase at nonpermissive temperature. Immunoblotting with antibodies to ubiquitin conjugates shows that conjugates disappear rapidly at restrictive temperatures in ts20 mutant but not in wild type E36 cells. The incorporation of 125I-ubiquitin into permeabilized ts20 cells is temperature-sensitive. Addition of extracts of another G2 phase mutant, FM3A ts85, with a temperature-sensitive ubiquitin activation enzyme (E1), to permeabilized ts20 cells at restrictive temperatures fails to complement their ubiquitin ligation activity. This indicates that the lesions in the two mutants are similar. Purified E1 from reticulocytes restores the conjugation activity of heat-inactivated permeabilized ts20 cells. Ubiquitin conjugation activity of cell-free extracts of ts20 cells was temperature-sensitive and could be restored by adding purified reticulocyte E1. Purified reticulocyte E2 or E3, on the other hand, did not restore the ubiquitin conjugation activity of heat-treated ts20 extracts. These results are consistent with the conclusion that ts20 has temperature-sensitive ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). The fact that two E1 mutants (ts20 and ts85) derived from different cell lines are arrested at the S/G2 boundary at restrictive temperatures strongly indicates that ubiquitin ligation is necessary for passage through this part of the cell cycle. The temperature thresholds of heat shock protein synthesis of ts20 and wild type E36 cells were identical. The implications of these findings with respect to a suggested role of ubiquitin in coupling between protein denaturation and the heat shock response are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1551289473,"We have developed a highly sensitive and specific solid-phase enzyme immunoassay for 9-deoxy-delta 9,delta 12-dihydroprostaglandin D2 (delta 12-PGJ2) and studied the occurrence of this novel PGD2 metabolite in human urine. The assay detected delta 12-PGJ2 over the range of 2-200 pg, and the antiserum showed 2% cross-reaction with PGJ2 and less than 0.2% with other PGs. We used this assay and purified the delta 12-PGJ2-like immunoreactive substance from human urine. Purification consisted of chromatographies on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge, a silicic acid column, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and finally an affinity column of anti-delta 12-PGJ2 antibody. As a result, about 850 ng of delta 12-PGJ2-like immunoreactive substance were recovered from 60 liters of human urine. The purified material was identified as delta 12-PGJ2 by gas chromatography/high resolution-selected ion monitoring using the molecular ion m/z 448[M]+. and ions [M - 15]+, [M - 43]+, [M - 100]+., and [M - 143]+. The amounts of delta 12-PGJ2 in the urine from normal, volunteer men and women were 151.5 +/- 20.0 and 65.6 +/- 5.4 ng/24 h (mean +/- S.E., n = 5), respectively. The delta 12-PGJ2 amount in urine did not alter significantly during storage for at least 24 h or by the addition of authentic PGD2 to urine samples, suggesting that the delta 12-PGJ2 we determined was not derived from the decomposition of PGD2 in the urine during storage or purification. Moreover, when a single dose of PGD2 (1 mg/kg) was injected intravenously into cynomolgus monkeys, the urinary level of delta 12-PGJ2 increased 20- to 180-fold over the normal levels, whereas the delta 12-PGJ2 level decreased by 40-50% of the normal levels, following the administration of indomethacin at a dose of 1 mg/kg. These results indicate that delta 12-PGJ2 is formed naturally in the body and excreted as a urinary PGD2 metabolite."
https://openalex.org/W2037590481,"Using the “Ter assay” we developed, three separate replication terminus (terC1, terC2, and terC3) sites on the E. coli chromosome were identified. The locations are at 28.3, 35.6, and 33.9 min on the linkage map, respectively. The terC1 site can block the counterclockwise replication fork only, while the terC2 and terC3 sites inhibit the clockwise fork traveling on the chromosome. DNA sequences of the terC sites required for termination of DNA replication are highly homologous to those of terminus (terR) sites of the R6K plasmid, and the 21 bp consensus DNA sequence of terC is 5′-(A or T) TTAGTTACAACAT (A or C) CT (A or T) (A or T) (A or T) T-3′. In addition, all Ter active pUC-terC plasmids had a low copy number and were unstable in the host cells."
https://openalex.org/W1591954937,"The complete amino acid sequences of two isoproteins of the factor V-activating enzyme (RVV-V) isolated from Vipera russelli (Russell's viper) venom were determined by sequencing S-pyridylethylated derivatives of the proteins and their peptide fragments generated by either chemical (cyanogen bromide and 2-(2-nitrophenylsulfenyl)-3-methyl-3-bromoindolenine) or enzymatic (trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, and lysyl endopeptidase) cleavages. Both enzymes, designated RVV-V alpha and RVV-V gamma, consist of 236 amino acid residues and have a N-linked oligosaccharide chain at Asn229. The six amino acid substitutions between RVV-V alpha and -V gamma are: Thr22(alpha)-Ala22(gamma), Gly29(alpha)-Ala29(gamma), Gln191(alpha)-Glu191(gamma), Ile192(alpha)-Met192(gamma), Gln193(alpha)-His193(gamma), and Asn224(alpha)-Ser224(gamma). The molecular weights were calculated as 26,182 for RVV-V alpha and 26,167 for RVV-V gamma. The sequences of the RVV-V isoproteins exhibited 62% identity with that of batroxobin, a thrombin-like enzyme present in Bothrops atrox venom, and 33% identity with that of human thrombin B chain. The most interesting difference between the structures of RVV-V and other trypsin-type serine proteases is that the conservative Ser214-Trp215-Gly216 sequence (chymotrypsinogen numbering), considered as the site of antiparallel beta-sheet formation between the protein substrate and most serine proteases, has been replaced by the corresponding sequence Ala-Gly-Gly."
https://openalex.org/W1546556670,"We have made use of the enhancement of the intrinsic fluorescence of the alpha subunit of transducin (alpha T), which accompanies guanine nucleotide exchange, to follow the reconstituted interactions between pure rhodopsin and pure transducin in phospholipid vesicles. When the pure alpha T.GDP complex is added to lipid vesicles containing rhodopsin and the beta gamma T complex, a light- and guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S)-dependent enhancement of the fluorescence emission of alpha T is observed. When GTP is substituted for GTP gamma S, a similar enhancement of the intrinsic fluorescence of alpha T occurs; however, this enhancement is transient and precedes a fluorescence decay which is complete in 2-5 min. The fact that the fluorescence decay is specifically induced by GTP and is not observed either with nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs or with NaF (plus AlCl3) indicates that the decay represents GTP hydrolysis in alpha T. The dose-response profiles for the effects of the beta gamma T complex on the rate and extent of the GTP gamma S-stimulated fluorescence enhancement of alpha T have also been examined. The addition of relatively low levels of beta gamma T to these reconstituted systems can promote the GTP gamma S-stimulated enhancement of the fluorescence of multiple alpha T subunits with half-maximal enhancement occurring at alpha T:beta gamma T ratios of 150:1. These findings are consistent with earlier suggestions (Fung, B. K.-K. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10495-10502) that the beta gamma T subunit dissociates from alpha T as a result of the GDP-GTP exchange reaction and thus can act catalytically to promote the activation of a number of inactive alpha T species. However, the dependence of the rate of the GTP gamma S-stimulated fluorescence enhancement on beta gamma T is complex and cannot be explained adequately by simple models where alpha T-beta gamma T interactions (or rhodopsin-transducin interactions) are rate-limiting for the rhodopsin-stimulated activation of the alpha T subunits. Overall, the results reported here demonstrate that fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to monitor directly a receptor-catalyzed activation-deactivation cycle of a GTP-binding protein within a lipid milieu."
https://openalex.org/W1553837590,"Two proteins that bind to yeast ARS DNA have been purified using conventional and oligonucleotide affinity chromatography. One protein has been purified to homogeneity and has a mass of 135 kDa. Competitive binding studies and DNase I footprinting show that the protein binds to a sequence about 80 base pairs away from the core consensus in the region known as domain B. This region has previously been shown to be required for efficient replication of plasmids carrying ARS1 elements. To investigate further whether the protein might have a function related to the ability of ARSs to act as replicators, binding to another ARS was tested. The protein binds to the functional ARS adjacent to the silent mating type locus HMR, called the HMR-E ARS, about 60 base pairs from the core consensus sequence. Surprisingly, there is little homology between the binding site at the HMR-E ARS and the binding site at ARS1. The 135-kDa protein is probably the same as ABF-I (SBF I) (Shore, D., Stillman, D. J. Brand, A. H., and Nasmyth, K. A. (1987) EMBO J. 6, 461-467; Buchman, A. R., Kimmerly, W. J., Rine, J., and Kornberg, R. D. (1988) Mol. Cell. Biol. 8, 210-225). A second DNA-binding protein was separated from ABF-I during later stages of the purification. This protein, which we designate ABF-III, also binds specifically to the ARS1 sequence, as shown by DNase I footprinting, at a site adjacent to the ABF-I recognition site. Purification of these two ARS binding proteins should aid in our understanding of the complex mechanisms that regulate eukaryotic DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1517193504,"The role of protein kinase C in luteinizing hormone (LH) release was analyzed in studies on the actions of phorbol esters and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in normal and protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme)-depleted pituitary cell cultures. LH secretory responses of normal pituitary cells to GnRH were reduced but not abolished in Ca2+-deficient medium, consistent with the existence of extracellular Ca2+-dependent and -independent components of GnRH action. Both of these components could be elicited by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). The LH secretory responses to TPA and GnRH were additive only at low doses and converged to a common maximum at high concentrations of the agonists in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+. The release of stored LH by GnRH and TPA was accompanied by secretion of newly synthesized LH from 2 to 5 h during stimulation by either of the agonists. LH synthesis was increased in a progressive and dose-dependent manner by GnRH and TPA, and the ratio between newly synthesized and released hormone was near 1:2. TPA caused rapid and complete translocation of cytosolic protein kinase C to the particulate fraction of pituitary cells, followed by a progressive decrease in total enzyme content to approximately 10% after 6 h. Partial recovery of the cytosolic enzyme (to 20%) occurred after washing and reincubation for 15 h. Such kinase C-depleted cells showed prominent, dose-dependent reductions in the actions of GnRH and TPA on LH release and synthesis in both normal and Ca2+-deficient media. These observations support the hypothesis that protein kinase C participates in LH biosynthesis and secretion in pituitary gonadotrophs and is involved in the actions of GnRH upon these processes."

https://openalex.org/W1586619880,"Escherichia coli ABC excinuclease initiates the removal of dodecanucleotides from damaged DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction. Using a synthetic DNA fragment containing a psoralen adduct at a defined position we have investigated the interaction of the components of the enzyme with substrate by DNase I footprinting. We find that the UvrA subunit binds to DNA specifically in the absence of cofactors and that the binding affinity is stimulated about 4-fold by ATP and only marginally inhibited by ADP. The UvrA.DNA complexes formed in the absence of co-factors or in the presence of either ATP or ADP are remarkably similar. In contrast, adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) increases nonspecific binding and completely abolishes the UvrA footprint. The UvrB subunit can associate with the UvrA subunit on DNA in the absence of ATP, but this ternary UvrA.UvrB.DNA complex is qualitatively different from that formed in the presence of ATP. The UvrC subunit elicits no additional change in the UvrA-UvrB footprint. Helicase II (UvrD protein) does not alter the UvrA-UvrB footprint but does appear to interact at the 5'-incision site of the postincision complex. DNA polymerase I fills in the excision gap in the presence or absence of helicase II and apparently releases the ABC excinuclease from the repaired DNA. Nearly 90% of the repair patches are 12 nucleotides long, and this length is not affected by helicase II. We see no evidence by DNase I footprinting for the formation of a multiprotein complex encompassing the UvrA, -B, -C, and -D proteins and DNA polymerase I."

https://openalex.org/W1965446095,"Intracellular perfusion of atrial myocytes with adenosine 5'-(gamma-thio) triphosphate (ATP gamma S), an ATP analog, elicits a progressive increase of the muscarinic potassium channel current, IK(M), in the absence of agonists. In this respect, ATP gamma S mimics the actions of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) analogs, which produce direct, persistent activation of the guanyl nucleotide-binding (G) protein controlling the K+(M) channel. The effect of ATP gamma S on IK(M), however, differs from that produced by GTP analogs in two aspects: it requires relatively large ATP gamma S concentrations, and it appears after a considerable delay, suggesting a rate-limiting step not present in similar experiments performed with guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio) triphosphate (GTP gamma S). Incubation of atrial homogenates with [35S]ATP gamma S leads to formation of significant amounts of [35S]GTP gamma S, suggesting that activation of IK(M) by ATP gamma S arises indirectly through its conversion into GTP gamma S by cellular enzymes. ATP gamma S is often used to demonstrate the involvement of protein phosphorylation in the control of various cellular processes. The finding that cytosolic application of ATP gamma S can also lead to G-protein activation implies that experiments with ATP gamma S must be interpreted with caution."
https://openalex.org/W1551957277,"The LAC12 gene of Kluyveromyces lactis codes for an inducible lactose permease. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a DNA fragment which includes the complete LAC12 gene. The 4.7-kilobase (kb) mRNA carrying LAC12 contained two open reading frames, ORFI (1761 bases) and ORFII (1266 bases), separated by a 573-base pair noncoding region. Mung bean and exonuclease VII mapping showed that there was no splicing of the 4.7-kb transcript and thus no intron between the two open reading frames. Chromosomal disruption of ORFI with the URA3 gene destroyed lactose transport activity, suggesting that ORFI codes for a component of the permease. Disruption of ORFII and the noncoding region between the two open reading frames did not affect the lactose permease function, indicating that they do not comprise a part of the permease. We do not know if ORFII is translated, but in either case, the structure of the 4.7-kb mRNA is unusual. We discuss possible origins for it. The peptide predicted from ORFI is hydrophobic as would be expected for a membrane-bound protein. Compared with other membrane proteins, LAC12 (ORFI) protein showed sequence similarity to the human glucose and the Escherichia coli xylose-H+ and arabinose-H+ transporters. No obvious amino acid sequence similarity was found with the lactose permease of E. coli."

The 22- and 23-kDa species are differentially glycosylated forms of the same protein, designated SPC 22/23. The amino acid sequence of SPC 22/23 was deduced from cDNA clones. The protein is synthesized without a cleavable amino-terminal signal sequence and contains a single site for N-linked glycosylation. SPC 22/23 appears to be anchored to the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane by a single hydrophobic segment near its amino terminus, with the remainder of the protein positioned on the lumenal side of the membrane. The amino acid sequence of SPC 22/23 shares homology with tryptic peptides derived from the hen oviduct signal peptidase glycoprotein, one of two possible proteins required for signal peptide processing in the avian system (Baker, R.K., and Lively, M.O. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 8561-8567). Therefore, the complete amino acid sequence of SPC 22/23 presented in this report corresponds to one of two possible proteins required for signal peptide processing in higher eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1479726417,"Insulin stimulates the translation of ribosomal protein (r-protein) mRNAs and the transcription of rDNA in mouse MM14DZ myoblasts. Analysis of the distribution of S16, L18, and L32 r-protein mRNAs in polysome gradients indicates that the increased translation of these mRNAs in insulin-treated myoblasts is due to the recruitment of mRNAs that were not previously being translated. In contrast, the translational efficiencies of beta-actin, c-myc, and p31 mRNAs are not affected by insulin. Hybridization analysis of RNA transcribed in nuclear run-on reactions indicates that insulin also stimulates the transcription of rDNA. Both the increases in r-protein translation and rDNA transcription occur coordinately and are maximal within 15 min of insulin treatment of myoblasts. However, insulin has no effect on the rate of cell division or the steady state levels of r-protein mRNAs. Surprisingly, after myoblasts differentiate into fibers, insulin does not affect the r-protein mRNA translation or rDNA transcription. These experiments indicate that the synthesis of the macromolecular components of ribosomes is tightly and coordinately controlled in myoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1530502979,"Human asialoglycoprotein receptor H1 is a single-spanning membrane protein with an amino-terminal domain of 40 residues exposed to the cytoplasm and the carboxyl-terminal domain translocated to the exoplasmic side of the membrane. It has been shown earlier that the transmembrane segment functions as an internal uncleaved signal sequence for insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum. In a deletion protein lacking almost the entire cytoplasmic domain, the signal sequence is cleaved at the carboxyl-terminal end of the transmembrane segment. All available criteria suggest that the protein is processed by signal peptidase. The cytoplasmic domain of the receptor does not directly inhibit signal cleavage since it does not detectably hinder cleavage of the normally amino-terminal signal sequence of influenza hemagglutinin in fusion proteins. We suggest that by its size or structure it affects the position of the receptor in the membrane and thus the accessibility of the potential cleavage site to signal peptidase."
https://openalex.org/W1545413125,"The topography of lactose permease, in native membrane vesicles and after reconstitution of the purified protein into proteoliposomes, has been investigated by labeling the membrane-embedded portions of the protein using photoactivatable, hydrophobic reagents and by labeling the exposed portions of the protein with water-soluble, electrophilic reagents. Some sites of modification have been localized in fragments of the protein produced by chemical and enzymatic cleavage. These define a number of hydrophilic loops and membrane-spanning regions and give some substance to topographic models of the permease. The N-terminal third of the molecule was labeled by three photoactivatable reagents (3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-m-iodophenyldiazirine and the phospholipid analogues 2-(aceto-(4-benzoylphenylether]-1-palmitoylphosphatidylcholine) and 2-(4-azido-2-nitrophenylaminoacetyl)-1-palmitoylphosphatidylcholin e) as well as the water soluble, electrophilic reagents. The C-terminal part of the molecule is labeled by the diazirine and, to a lesser extent, by the phospholipid analogues. It apparently has more nucleophilic groups accessible to water-soluble reagents than the N-terminal domain, in which the density of apparently unreactive ionizable residues proved to be unexpectedly high. The apparent lack of reactivity of some of these residues may be explained either by their being buried in the protein moiety within the membrane domain, or by their close association with other ionizable residues on the surface of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1576918861,"Abstract We have identified two glycyl residues whose integrity is essential for the catalytic competence of a model pyridoxal 5'-phosphate requiring enzyme, D-serine dehydratase from Escherichia coli. This was accomplished by isolating and sequencing the structural gene from wild type E. coli and from two mutant strains that produce inactive D-serine dehydratase. DNA sequencing indicated the presence of a single glycine to aspartic acid replacement in each variant. The amino acid replacements lie in a glycine-rich region of D-serine dehydratase well removed from pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-binding lysine 118 in the primary structure of the enzyme. The striking effect of these two glycine to aspartic acid replacements on catalytic activity, the conservation of the glycine-rich region in several pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes that catalyze alpha/beta-eliminations, and the placement of similar glycine-rich sequences in well-characterized active site structures suggest that the glycine-rich region interacts with the cofactor at the active site of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1483123603,"alpha-Lytic protease is a 19.8-kDa protein secreted from the Gram-negative bacterium Lysobacter enzymogenes. We have cloned and sequenced the gene for this serine protease. The nucleotide sequence contains an open reading frame which codes for the 198-residue mature enzyme and a potential prepro-peptide, also of 198 residues. The COOH-terminal 49 residues of the pro-peptide are significantly homologous to the propeptides of Streptomyces griseus proteases A and B. We suggest that this pro-peptide region facilitates formation of the active enzyme. A region bridging the NH2-terminal pre- and pro-peptides is homologous to a maize inhibitor of serine proteases. We speculate that this region inhibits enzymatic activity of the prepro-enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1494296129,"A purified rat hepatic monooxygenase system containing cytochrome P-450b oxidizes testosterone to androstenedione and 16 alpha- and 16 beta-hydroxytestosterone at approximately equal rates. The metabolism of epitestosterone by the same system is characterized by a marked stereoselectivity in favor of 16 beta-hydroxylation (4- to 5-fold relative to 16 alpha-hydroxylation), formation of 15 alpha-hydroxyepitestosterone, and a rate of androstenedione formation which is three to five times higher than that observed with testosterone. Apparent Km values for 16 alpha- and 16 beta-hydroxylation and androstenedione formation are 20-30 microM with either substrate. Mass spectral analysis of the androstenedione formed from [16,16-2H2]testosterone and [16,16-2H2] epitestosterone indicates essentially complete retention of deuterium, thereby ruling out a mechanism of androstenedione formation via C-16 hydroxylation followed by loss of water and rearrangement. Mass spectral analysis of the C-16 hydroxylation products from incubations of testosterone or epitestosterone in 18O2 shows essentially complete incorporation of 18O (greater than 95%). Androstenedione formed from testosterone is enriched in 18O only 2-fold (5-8%) over background, while the androstenedione formed from epitestosterone shows 84% enrichment. Kinetic experiments utilizing [17-2H]testosterone and [17-2H]epitestosterone as substrates indicate that cleavage of the C-17 carbon-hydrogen bond is involved in a rate-limiting step in the formation of androstenedione from both substrates. Taken together, our results indicate that androstenedione formation from epitestosterone proceeds exclusively through the gem-diol pathway, while androstenedione formation from testosterone may proceed through a combination of gem-diol and dual hydrogen abstraction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1499057431,"The lactose permease, which catalyzes galactoside-proton symport into Escherichia coli, has been purified and reconstituted in active form into artificial lipid vesicles. The roles of many detergents and phospholipids in solubilization and stabilization of the activity of the permease have been examined with a view to its eventual crystallization. Initial rates of uptake into reconstituted proteoliposomes determined by rapid mixing techniques proved that the activity of the permease can be comparable to that observed in the intact cell, while the best values for uptake rates obtained with conventional techniques were comparable to those reported for vesicles. The activity of the purified protein has been monitored over time periods of hours to weeks. It is shown that, under the best current conditions, the permease retains full activity for 1 to 2 weeks. Although this is still marginal for its crystallization, future improvements can now be assayed by rather stringent criteria. The mechanism of galactoside transport into reconstituted proteoliposome has been investigated by examining the effects of pH on influx into the vesicles. It is shown that the observed effects are entirely consistent with the predictions of a simple model of proton symport. The apparent increase in rate of uptake that is observed in the presence of a pH gradient is not so much due to an acceleration by a component of the protonmotive force as to the relaxation of inhibition by a product (internal protons) of the symport reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1526432526,"The kinetic constants were examined for the cleavage of several types of procollagen by type I/II procollagen N-proteinase. The Km values were essentially the same (0.2 microM) for chick type I procollagen, human type I procollagen, and chick type II procollagen. However, the Vmax values differed over a 14-fold range. As reported previously, the enzyme did not cleave denatured type I or II procollagen. Also, it did not cleave human type III procollagen which contains the same scissle -Pro-Gln- bond as the pro-alpha 1(I) chain of type I procollagen. To explain the observations, Chou-Fasman rules were used to compare the secondary structures of the cleavage sites in the procollagens. The results supported a previous suggestion (Helseth, D. L., Jr., Lechner, J. L., and Veis, A. (1979) Biopolymers 18, 3005-3014) that the region carboxyl-terminal to cleavage site in the pro-alpha 1(I) chain of type I procollagen was in a hairpin conformation consisting of a beta-sheet, beta-turn, and beta-sheet. In both chick and human type I procollagen, the hairpin loop in the pro-alpha 1(I) chain consisted of about 18 amino acids. The cleavage site itself was in a short alpha-helical structure of four or five amino acids. The pro-alpha 2(I) chains had a similar hairpin loop of about 14 amino acids and alpha-helix of four or five amino acids containing the cleavage site. Chick type II procollagen, which had the highest Vmax value, had a longer hairpin structure of 22 amino acids, and the cleavage site was in a longer alpha-helical domain of 10 amino acids. In contrast, type III procollagen had a random-coil conformation in the same region. The results help to explain the unusual substrate requirements of type I/II N-proteinase. They also help explain why mutations that produce in-frame deletions of amino acids 84 or more residues carboxyl-terminal to the cleavage site make the protein resistant to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1551844480,"Mutagenesis by N-acetoxy-N-trifluoroacetyl-4-aminobiphenyl, a reactive form of the human bladder carcinogen 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP), was studied in Escherichia coli virus M13mp10. N-acetoxy-N-trifluoroacetyl-4-ABP-treated DNA containing 140 lesions/duplex genome, when introduced into excision repair-competent cells induced for SOS mutagenic processing, resulted in a 40-fold increase in mutation frequency over background in the lacZ alpha gene fragment. DNA sequence changes were determined for 20 independent mutants. G-C base pairs were the major targets for base pair substitution mutations, although significant mutagenic activity was also observed at certain A-T base pairs. Deletion and frameshift mutations also were found in this sample. The salient feature of this partial mutational was a hotspot that occurred at position 6357 (amino acid 30 of the beta-galactosidase fragment encoded by M13mp10); this A-T to T-A transversion appeared in 6 of the 20 mutants. The property of ABP to mutate A-T base pairs was consistent with the result that N-hydroxy-ABP reverted Salmonella typhimurium strain TA104, which is presumed to revert primarily due to mutations at these sites. The ability of the major carcinogen-DNA adduct formed by ABP in vivo and in vitro, N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4-aminobiphenyl, to cause base pair substitution mutations was also investigated. This adduct was positioned specifically in the minus strand at position 6270 in duplex M13mp10 DNA. In the presence of the mutagenesis-enhancing plasmid pGW16 and UV induction of SOS mutagenic processing, it was shown that fewer than 0.02% of the adducts resulted in transition or transversion mutations following transfection of DNA into excision-repair competent cells. Similar results were obtained in uvrA and uvrC backgrounds. Although the major adduct did not cause base substitution mutations under these experimental conditions, the contribution of this lesion to the entire spectrum of mutations in the lacZ alpha fragment seems likely."
https://openalex.org/W1504850018,"Membrane secretory component (mSC) mediates the transcellular movement of polymeric IgA from the sinusoidal to the bile canalicular surface of rat hepatocytes. Prior to or concomitant with arrival at the bile canalicular membrane, mSC is cleaved, producing a soluble proteolytic fragment (fSC) which is released into the bile. Conversion of mSC to fSC occurs at the cell surface of cultured rat hepatocytes (Musil, L. S., and Baenziger, J. U. (1987) J. Cell Biol. 104, 1725-1733), suggesting that vectorial release of fSC into bile in vivo may reflect localization of a mSC-specific protease to bile canalicular membranes. We have established a reconstituted system to examine the process of specific cleavage of mSC to yield fSC and to characterize the protease activity responsible. A membrane fraction highly enriched for endocytic vesicles was found to contain approximately 90% of the [35S]Cys-mSC from metabolically labeled rat liver slices but only 5% of the cellular protein. No cleavage activity was present in these vesicles. Highly enriched bile canalicular membranes were able to mediate cleavage of metabolically labeled mSC to a fragment indistinguishable from authentic fSC. In the absence of nonionic detergent, cleavage was dependent on the presence of polyethylene glycol, presumably to mediate fusion of mSC-enriched membranes with bile canalicular membranes. Following solubilization with nonionic detergent, cleavage was no longer dependent on the addition of polyethylene glycol. Cleavage of mSC was not observed with either intact or detergent-solubilized sinusoidal, microsomal, or lysosomal membranes. We have thus identified a proteolytic activity associated with bile canalicular membranes which has the properties of a membrane protein and is likely to be responsible for production of fSC in vivo. Its highly restricted localization to the bile canalicular membrane would account for the vectorial release of fSC into the bile."
https://openalex.org/W1491428530,"Nitrate reductase, released and purified from membrane fractions of Escherichia coli, is composed of three subunits. Formation of the enzyme depends on induction of the nar operon, narGHJI, which is composed of four open reading frames (ORF). Previous studies established that the first two genes in the operon narG and narH encode the alpha and beta subunits, respectively, while formation of the gamma subunit, cytochrome bNR, depends on expression of the promoter distal genes. The narJ and narI genes were subcloned separately into plasmids where each was under the control of the nar promoter. Expression of these plasmids in a mutant which forms only alpha and beta subunits revealed that expression of the narI gene is sufficient to restore normal levels of cytochrome bNR, but expression of both genes is required for assembly of fully active, membrane-bound nitrate reductase. The amino acid composition, the N-terminal sequence, and the sequence of cyanogen bromide fragments derived from the isolated gamma subunit corresponds to that expected for a protein produced by the narI ORF. A protein corresponding to the narJ ORF did not appear to be associated with the purified nitrate reductase complex or with the complex immunoprecipitated from Triton X-100-solubilized membrane preparations. We conclude that narI encodes the gamma subunit (cytochrome bNR) and that while the product of the narJ gene is required for assembly of fully active membrane-bound enzyme it is not tightly associated with the active enzyme."

Its catalytic site contains one tyrosyl radical, which is localized to Tyr-122 in one of its polypeptide chains. The engineered Tyr-122----Phe protein was used to demonstrate that it is possible to form a correct ferric iron center in vitro in the absence of Tyr-122. Heterodimers, consisting of one Tyr-122-containing polypeptide chain and one Phe-122-containing polypeptide chain, were constructed. The heterodimer population contained one-half the amount of tyrosyl radical as compared to a homodimer with Tyr-122, i.e. every second heterodimer contains a tyrosyl radical. Thus, one Tyr-122 is sufficient for radical formation. Radical-containing heterodimers are catalytically competent."
https://openalex.org/W1534523139,"Single-stranded DNA binding protein is a key component in growth of bacteriophage T7. In addition, DNA synthesis by the purified in vitro replication system is markedly stimulated when the DNA template is coated with Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB). In an attempt to understand the mechanism for this stimulation, we have studied the effect of E. coli SSB on DNA synthesis by the T7 DNA polymerase using a primed single-stranded M13 DNA template which serves as a model for T7 lagging strand DNA synthesis. Polyacrylamide gel analysis of the DNA product synthesized on this template in the absence of SSB indicated that the T7 DNA polymerase pauses at many specific sites, some stronger than others. By comparing the position of pausing with the DNA sequence of this region and by using a DNA template that contains an extremely stable hairpin structure, it was found that many, but not all, of these pause positions correspond to regions of potential secondary structure. The presence of SSB during synthesis resulted in a large reduction in the frequency of hesitations at many sites that correspond to these secondary structures. However, the facts that a large percentage of the pause sites remain unaffected even at saturating levels of SSB and that SSB stimulates synthesis on a singly primed poly(dA) template suggested that other mechanisms also contribute to the stimulation of DNA synthesis caused by SSB. Using a sucrose gradient analysis, we found that SSB increases the affinity of the polymerase for single-stranded DNA that this increased binding is only noticed when the polymerase concentration is limiting. The effect of this difference in polymerase affinity was clearly observed by a polyacrylamide gel analysis of the product DNA synthesized during a limited DNA synthesis reaction using conditions where only two nucleotides are added to the primer. Under these circumstances, where the presence of hairpin structures should not contribute to the stimulatory effect of SSB, we found that the extension of the primer is stimulated 4-fold if the DNA template is coated with SSB. Furthermore, SSB had no effect on this synthesis at large polymerase to template ratios."
https://openalex.org/W1530952133,"Replacement of glycine by aspartic acid at either of two sites in a conserved, glycine-rich region inactivates the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzyme D-serine dehydratase (DSD) from Escherichia coli. To investigate why aspartic acid at position 279 or 281 causes a loss of activity, we measured the affinity of the G—-D variants for pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and a cofactor:substrate analog complex and compared the UV, CD, and fluorescence properties of wild-type D-serine dehydratase and the inactive variants. The two G—-D variants DSD(G279D) and DSD (G281D) displayed marked differences from wild-type D-serine dehydratase and from each other with respect to their affinity for pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and for a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate:glycine Schiff base. Compared to the wild-type enzyme, the cofactor affinity of DSD(G279D) and DSD(G281D) was decreased 225- and 50-fold, respectively, and the ability to retain a cofactor:glycine complex was decreased 765- and 1970-fold. The spectral properties of the inactive variants suggest that they form a Schiff base linkage with pyridoxal 5′-phosphate but do not hold the cofactor in a catalytically competent orientation. Moreover, the amount of cofactor aldamine in equilibrium with cofactor Schiff base is increased in DSD(G279D) and DSD(G281D) relative to that in wild-type DSD. Collectively, our findings indicate that introduction of a carboxymethyl side chain at G-279 or G-281 directly or indirectly disrupts catalytically essential protein-cofactor and protein-substrate interactions and thereby prevents processing of the enzyme bound cofactor:substrate complex. The conserved glycine-rich region is thus either an integral part of the D-serine dehydratase active site or conformationally linked to it."
https://openalex.org/W1512753316,"The two genes FRS1 and FRS2 encoding, respectively, the large (alpha) and small (beta) subunits of cytoplasmic phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase from bakers' yeast have been cloned and sequenced. The derived protein primary structures are confirmed by peptide sequences evenly distributed along the reading frames. These predict a subunit Mr of 67,347 for alpha and 57,433 for beta, in good agreement with earlier determinations carried out on the purified protein. These subunit sequences have been compared to those of Escherichia coli phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase as well as to the small beta subunit of the corresponding yeast mitochondrial enzyme; limited but significant homology was found between the two alpha subunits on the one hand and between the three beta subunits on the other hand. The results suggest that these three enzymes, from E. coli, yeast cytoplasm, and yeast mitochondria, have strongly diverged from one another. The initiation sites of transcription have been determined for both yeast genes. Their 5'-upstream regions show no sequence similarities that would have indicated a coordinate control of gene expression at the transcriptional level. Measurements of steady-state levels of FRS-mRNAs in overproducing strains indicate that there is no restriction in mRNA synthesis. Therefore the control of gene expression, leading to a balanced synthesis of alpha and beta subunits, is likely to occur at the translational level."
https://openalex.org/W1494467542,"Gastrin gene expression was observed in two permanent rat insulinoma (RIN) cell lines derived from a rat insulinoma. Gastrin expression was selective; highest expression was seen in a cell line which did not express other islet cell hormones. Gastrin mRNA transcription initiated from the same promoter as antral gastrin mRNA. DNA transfection studies with a gastrin chloramphenicol acetyltransferase chimeric gene showed higher expression in gastrin-expressing RIN cells than non-gastrin-expressing islet cells. This implies that gastrin-expressing RIN cells selectively express a trans-acting transcriptional activator which binds to cis-acting regulatory sequences within the 5′-flanking DNA sequence and first exon of the gastrin gene. The gastrin peptide precursor synthesized in these RIN cell lines is subject to the same repertoire of posttranslational modifications within the cell's secretory apparatus (endoproteolytic cleavage, tyrosine sulfation, and C-terminal amidation) as seen in antral G cells. Gastrin mRNA levels in these RIN cells were selectively increased by increasing the extracellular calcium concentration. Membrane depolarization also stimulated gastrin mRNA levels, probably through activation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Thus, these gastrin-expressing RIN cell lines provide permanent cell lines useful in analyzing the cellular regulation of gastrin gene expression."

A cDNA clone containing the entire coding sequence of Yb3 glutathione S-transferase mRNA was incorporated into a pIN-III expression vector used to transform Escherichia coli. A fusion Yb3-protein containing 14 additional amino acid residues at its N terminus was purified to homogeneity. Recombinant Yb3 was enzymatically active with both 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene as substrates but lacked glutathione peroxidase activity. Substrate specificity patterns of recombinant Yb3 were more limited than those of glutathione S-transferase isoenzymes containing Yb1- or Yb2-type subunits. Peptides corresponding to unique amino acid sequences of Yb3 as well as a peptide from a region of homology with Yb1 and Yb2 subunits were synthesized. These synthetic peptides were used to raise antibodies specific to Yb3 and others that cross-reacted with all Yb forms. Immunoblotting was utilized to identify the natural counterpart of recombinant Yb3 among rat glutathione transferases. Brain and testis glutathione S-transferases were rich in Yb3 subunits, but very little was found in liver or kidney. Physical properties, substrate specificities, and binding patterns of the recombinant protein paralleled properties of the natural isoenzyme isolated from brain."

These mutant carriers were all as sensitive as the wild-type carrier to the proline analogue azetidine 2-carboxylate. However, the mutant carriers with Ser-281 and Ser-344 were resistant to N-ethylmaleimide, whereas the mutant carrier with Ser-349 was as sensitive as the wild-type carrier to this reagent. These results indicate that these cysteine residues are not essential for proline transport and that Cys-281 and Cys-344 may be close to the substrate-binding site that contains an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive residue."

It was shown that the enzyme transfers phosphate groups from organic phosphoric acid esters (donors) to water as well as to the 2'-, 3'-, or 5'-hydroxyls of nucleosides, nucleotides, and other compounds with free hydroxyl groups (acceptors). The enzyme was crystallized in two forms by precipitation with polyethylene glycol. Needles were formed in buffer containing Mg2+, whereas thin rectangular plates appeared in the presence of the non-ionic detergent n-octyl glucoside. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under partially or completely denaturating conditions revealed that the native enzyme is a tetramer consisting of identical 24-kDa monomers. Owing to surface inactivation, polyethylene glycol, non-ionic, or Zwitterionic detergents are indispensable for enzyme stability. The detergents are able to reactivate inactivated enzyme when present near or above their critical micelle concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1602754323,"The sensitivity of the membrane-bound hydrogenase of Bradyrhizobium japonicum to inactivation by proteases and membrane-impermeant protein modification reagents was compared under hydrogen versus oxygen. In membrane vesicles, the half-life of enzyme inactivation by trypsin of the H2-reduced enzyme was approximately 10 min, whereas O2-oxidized enzyme was much less sensitive to trypsin inactivation (half-life of over 90 min). Diazobenzene sulfonate (DABS) affected the enzyme activity in a manner similar to proteases. With DABS, the enzyme had a half-life of 2-3 min under H2 versus over 30 min under O2. Experiments in which the gas phase (containing either H2 or O2) available to the membranes was changed prior to the protease or chemical modification treatments indicated that it is the redox state of the enzyme at the time of the treatment which determines the sensitivity of the enzyme to inactivation. The redox-dependent differences in the behavior of the membrane-bound enzyme were attributed to changes in the accessibility of the small (33 kDa) subunit. The kinetics of enzyme inactivation by trypsin, under H2, correlated very well with the degradation of the intact 33-kDa subunit, whereas the large subunit (65 kDa) was rather resistant to proteolytic degradation. DABS treatment was found to decrease the reactivity of the small subunit to its antibody concomitant with enzyme inactivation under H2, but without such an effect on the O2-oxidized enzyme. In contrast to the results with the membrane-bound enzyme, purified dehydrogenase was found to be equally susceptible to inactivation by proteolysis or chemical modification irrespective of whether the treatments were performed under H2 or O2. These results indicate that, in the membrane, hydrogenase undergoes a redox-linked conformational change, whereby the small subunit of the enzyme becomes more accessible to external reagents when the enzyme is in its reduced form."
https://openalex.org/W1516425760,"Studies of the conformational properties of the yeast 5 S RNA-protein complex were initiated in an attempt to understand loss of ability of its individual protein and RNA components to reassociate. The 5 S RNA-L1a protein complex from 60 S ribosomal subunits of Saccharomyces cerevisiae could be dissociated by high concentrations of magnesium. The degree of dissociation could be monitored by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The complex was completely dissociated at about 390 mM magnesium, but was stable at 4 degrees C in 25 mM EDTA up to 48 h. The overall conformation of the complex was monitored using tritium exchange. The tritium exchange behavior was dramatically changed as the complex was dissociated. To determine contribution of each component to the observed overall change reflected in the tritium exchange behavior, ethidium bromide (EtBr) and bis-anilinonaphthalene-sulfonic acid fluorescence were used to monitor the RNA and the protein moiety, respectively. Upon dissociation of the complex, the fluorescence intensity resulting from EtBr binding to RNA decreased, whereas the intensity due to bis-anilinonaphthalene-sulfonic acid binding to the protein increased. Turbidity was observed during dissociation of the complex. These results indicate that disruption of interactions between the 5 S RNA and protein L1a resulted in an exposure of solvent-accessible apolar regions in the protein molecule. Such exposure led to insolubility of protein and irreversibility in interaction between individual components. Properties of the separated components also suggest that special conditions may be required for these components to associate during ribosomal assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1587500796,"A 569-base pair fragment encompassing the upstream regulatory region, the RNA initiation sites, and the initial part of the coding region of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase II gene has been analyzed for the presence of sites which undergo conformational modification under torsional stress. Fine mapping of P1 and S1 endonuclease-sensitive sites was obtained on single topoisomers produced by in vitro ligation. It was shown that the upstream activator sequence, the TATA sequence, a region directly upstream to the RNA initiation sites, and several positions in the first segment of the transcribed region change conformation as a function of the applied torsional stress in a precisely coordinate fashion. The superhelical density optima for this coordinate modifications have been determined. Analysis of the conformational changes of the promoter sequence in several naturally occurring (Young, E.

D., Kaplan, S., Konisky, J., Savage, D., and Wolle, R. S., eds) pp. 335-361, Plenum Publishing Corp., New York) up-promoter constitutive mutants was performed. This analysis has shown that the conformation of functionally relevant sites changes as a function of sequence mutations that have taken place elsewhere; this shows that the conformational behavior of the whole promoter region is linked and suggests transmission in cis of topological effects in RNA polymerase II promoters."
