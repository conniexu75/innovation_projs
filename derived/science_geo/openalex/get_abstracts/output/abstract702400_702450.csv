https://openalex.org/W4305040595,"Mixed plastics waste represents an abundant and largely untapped feedstock for the production of valuable products. The chemical diversity and complexity of these materials, however, present major barriers to realizing this opportunity. In this work, we show that metal-catalyzed autoxidation depolymerizes comingled polymers into a mixture of oxygenated small molecules that are advantaged substrates for biological conversion. We engineer a robust soil bacterium, Pseudomonas putida, to funnel these oxygenated compounds into a single exemplary chemical product, either β-ketoadipate or polyhydroxyalkanoates. This hybrid process establishes a strategy for the selective conversion of mixed plastics waste into useful chemical products."
https://openalex.org/W4305040310,Lowering platinum (Pt) loadings without sacrificing power density and durability in fuel cells is highly desired yet challenging because of the high mass transport resistance near the catalyst surfaces. We tailored the three-phase microenvironment by optimizing the ionomer by incorporating ionic covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets into Nafion. The mesoporous apertures of 2.8 to 4.1 nanometers and appendant sulfonate groups enabled the proton transfer and promoted oxygen permeation. The mass activity of Pt and the peak power density of the fuel cell with Pt/Vulcan (0.07 mg of Pt per square centimeter in the cathode) both reached 1.6 times those values without the COF. This strategy was applied to catalyst layers with various Pt loadings and different commercial catalysts.

Here, we develop DishBrain, a system that harnesses the inherent adaptive computation of neurons in a structured environment. In vitro neural networks from human or rodent origins are integrated with in silico computing via a high-density multielectrode array. Through electrophysiological stimulation and recording, cultures are embedded in a simulated game-world, mimicking the arcade game ""Pong."" Applying implications from the theory of active inference via the free energy principle, we find apparent learning within five minutes of real-time gameplay not observed in control conditions. Further experiments demonstrate the importance of closed-loop structured feedback in eliciting learning over time. Cultures display the ability to self-organize activity in a goal-directed manner in response to sparse sensory information about the consequences of their actions, which we term synthetic biological intelligence. Future applications may provide further insights into the cellular correlates of intelligence."
https://openalex.org/W4305040584,"The inflammasome-mediated cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) causes pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release to control pathogen infection, but how pathogens evade this immune response remains largely unexplored. Here we identify the known protein phosphatase PtpB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a phospholipid phosphatase inhibiting the host inflammasome-pyroptosis pathway. Mechanistically, PtpB dephosphorylated phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate in host cell membrane, thus disrupting the membrane localization of the cleaved GSDMD to inhibit cytokine release and pyroptosis of macrophages. Notably, this phosphatase activity requires PtpB binding to ubiquitin. Disrupting phospholipid phosphatase activity or the ubiquitin-interacting motif of PtpB enhanced host GSDMD-dependent immune responses and reduced intracellular pathogen survival. Thus, pathogens inhibit pyroptosis and counteract host immunity by altering host membrane composition."
https://openalex.org/W4305040316,"We engineered an ultrasensitive reporter of p16 INK4a , a biomarker of cellular senescence. Our reporter detected p16 INK4a -expressing fibroblasts with certain senescent characteristics that appeared shortly after birth in the basement membrane adjacent to epithelial stem cells in the lung. Furthermore, these p16 INK4a+ fibroblasts had enhanced capacity to sense tissue inflammation and respond through their increased secretory capacity to promote epithelial regeneration. In addition, p16 INK4a expression was required in fibroblasts to enhance epithelial regeneration. This study highlights a role for p16 INK4a+ fibroblasts as tissue-resident sentinels in the stem cell niche that monitor barrier integrity and rapidly respond to inflammation to promote tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W4305082891,"There has been a long-standing demand for noninvasive neuroimaging methods that can detect neuronal activity at both high temporal and high spatial resolution. We present a two-dimensional fast line-scan approach that enables direct imaging of neuronal activity with millisecond precision while retaining the high spatial resolution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This approach was demonstrated through in vivo mouse brain imaging at 9.4 tesla during electrical whisker-pad stimulation. In vivo spike recording and optogenetics confirmed the high correlation of the observed MRI signal with neural activity. It also captured the sequential and laminar-specific propagation of neuronal activity along the thalamocortical pathway. This high-resolution, direct imaging of neuronal activity will open up new avenues in brain science by providing a deeper understanding of the brain’s functional organization, including the temporospatial dynamics of neural networks."
https://openalex.org/W4305040598,"Studies of the proteome would benefit greatly from methods to directly sequence and digitally quantify proteins and detect posttranslational modifications with single-molecule sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate single-molecule protein sequencing using a dynamic approach in which single peptides are probed in real time by a mixture of dye-labeled N-terminal amino acid recognizers and simultaneously cleaved by aminopeptidases. We annotate amino acids and identify the peptide sequence by measuring fluorescence intensity, lifetime, and binding kinetics on an integrated semiconductor chip. Our results demonstrate the kinetic principles that allow recognizers to identify multiple amino acids in an information-rich manner that enables discrimination of single amino acid substitutions and posttranslational modifications. With further development, we anticipate that this approach will offer a sensitive, scalable, and accessible platform for single-molecule proteomic studies and applications."
https://openalex.org/W4305040321,"The evolution of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenases (Rubiscos) that discriminate strongly between their substrate carbon dioxide and the undesired side substrate dioxygen was an important event for photosynthetic organisms adapting to an oxygenated environment. We use ancestral sequence reconstruction to recapitulate this event. We show that Rubisco increased its specificity and carboxylation efficiency through the gain of an accessory subunit before atmospheric oxygen was present. Using structural and biochemical approaches, we retrace how this subunit was gained and became essential. Our work illuminates the emergence of an adaptation to rising ambient oxygen levels, provides a template for investigating the function of interactions that have remained elusive because of their essentiality, and sheds light on the determinants of specificity in Rubisco."
https://openalex.org/W4305082899,"Efficient waste heat dissipation has become increasingly challenging as transistor size has decreased to nanometers. As governed by universal Umklapp phonon scattering, the thermal conductivity of semiconductors decreases at higher temperatures and causes heat transfer deterioration under high-power conditions. In this study, we realized simultaneous electrical and thermal rectification (TR) in a monolayer MoSe2-WSe2 lateral heterostructure. The atomically thin MoSe2-WSe2 heterojunction forms an electrical diode with a high ON/OFF ratio up to 104. Meanwhile, a preferred heat dissipation channel was formed from MoSe2 to WSe2 in the ON state of the heterojunction diode at high bias voltage with a TR factor as high as 96%. Higher thermal conductivity was achieved at higher temperatures owing to the TR effect caused by the local temperature gradient. Furthermore, the TR factor could be regulated from maximum to zero by rotating the angle of the monolayer heterojunction interface. This result opens a path for designing novel nanoelectronic devices with enhanced thermal dissipation."
https://openalex.org/W4305040308,"The transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) channel is the primary molecular transducer responsible for the cool sensation elicited by menthol and cold in mammals. TRPM8 activation is controlled by cooling compounds together with the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ). Our knowledge of cold sensation and the therapeutic potential of TRPM8 for neuroinflammatory diseases and pain will be enhanced by understanding the structural basis of cooling agonist- and PIP 2 -dependent TRPM8 activation. We present cryo–electron microscopy structures of mouse TRPM8 in closed, intermediate, and open states along the ligand- and PIP 2 -dependent gating pathway. Our results uncover two discrete agonist sites, state-dependent rearrangements in the gate positions, and a disordered-to-ordered transition of the gate-forming S6—elucidating the molecular basis of chemically induced cool sensation in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W4305040309,"Deciding whether to grow or to divert energy to stress responses is a major physiological trade-off for plants surviving in fluctuating environments. We show that three leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) act as direct ligand-perceiving receptors for PLANT PEPTIDE CONTAINING SULFATED TYROSINE (PSY)-family peptides and mediate switching between two opposing pathways. By contrast to known LRR-RKs, which activate signaling upon ligand binding, PSY receptors (PSYRs) activate the expression of various genes encoding stress response transcription factors upon depletion of the ligands. Loss of PSYRs results in defects in plant tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stresses. This ligand-deprivation–dependent activation system potentially enables plants to exert tuned regulation of stress responses in the tissues proximal to metabolically dysfunctional damaged sites where ligand production is impaired."
https://openalex.org/W4305040323,"An organized combination of stiff and elastic domains within a single material can synergistically tailor bulk mechanical properties. However, synthetic methods to achieve such sophisticated architectures remain elusive. We report a rapid, facile, and environmentally benign method to pattern strong and stiff semicrystalline phases within soft and elastic matrices using stereo-controlled ring-opening metathesis polymerization of an industrial monomer, cis -cyclooctene. Dual polymerization catalysis dictates polyolefin backbone chemistry, which enables patterning of compositionally uniform materials with seamless stiff and elastic interfaces. Visible light–induced activation of a metathesis catalyst results in the formation of semicrystalline trans polyoctenamer rubber, outcompeting the formation of cis polyoctenamer rubber, which occurs at room temperature. This bottom-up approach provides a method for manufacturing polymeric materials with promising applications in soft optoelectronics and robotics."
https://openalex.org/W4305082887,"A goal in the characterization of supported metal catalysts is to achieve particle-by-particle analysis of the charge state strongly correlated with the catalytic activity. Here, we demonstrate the direct identification of the charge state of individual platinum nanoparticles (NPs) supported on titanium dioxide using ultrahigh sensitivity and precision electron holography. Sophisticated phase-shift analysis for the part of the NPs protruding into the vacuum visualized slight potential changes around individual platinum NPs. The analysis revealed the number (only one to six electrons) and sense (positive or negative) of the charge per platinum NP. The underlying mechanism of platinum charging is explained by the work function differences between platinum and titanium dioxide (depending on the orientation relationship and lattice distortion) and by first-principles calculations in terms of the charge transfer processes."
https://openalex.org/W4305040984,"The spectrophotometer has been used for decades to measure the density of bacterial populations as the turbidity expressed as optical density-OD. However, the OD alone is an unreliable metric and is only proportionately accurate to cell titers to about an OD of 0.1. The relationship between OD and cell titer depends on the configuration of the spectrophotometer, the length of the light path through the culture, the size of the bacterial cells, and the cell culture density. We demonstrate the importance of plate reader calibration to identify the exact relationship between OD and cells/mL. We use four bacterial genera and two sizes of micro-titer plates (96-well and 384-well) to show that the cell/ml per unit OD depends heavily on the bacterial cell size and plate size. We applied our calibration curve to real growth curve data and conclude the cells/mL-rather than OD-is a metric that can be used to directly compare results across experiments, labs, instruments, and species."

https://openalex.org/W4305040286,"COVID-19 has a substantial and unexpected impact on individuals' daily life around the world. Unprecedented public health restrictions such as lockdowns have the potential to affect multiple dimensions of individuals' well-being, while the severity of such restrictions varies across countries. However, a holistic perspective comparing differences in and drivers of the different dimensions of well-being across countries differentially affected by COVID-19 is missing to date. We address this gap in the literature by examining the mental, social, functional, and financial well-being of 2,100 individuals across Australia, France, Germany, and South Africa by means of a survey administered during May of 2021. Supporting our holistic approach, we find that the different dimensions of well-being are correlated, with survey respondents from France reporting the lowest and those from Australia reporting the highest overall level of well-being. Respondents' subjective and objective evaluations of their living conditions during lockdowns as well as positive health and financial behaviors are positively associated with their well-being during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4305040312,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection results in a wide range of outcomes characterized by a high heterogeneity in both symptomatology and susceptibility to the disease. In such a perspective, COVID-19 may be considered as a multifactorial disease featured by the interaction between the environment, which is the virus itself, and the genetic profile of the host. Our analysis aimed at investigating the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 within families whose members responded in different ways to the infection, although the exposure was common to the entire group and occurred before the availability of any vaccine. The goal was to understand how the genetic background of each subject can influence the viral infection outcome and hence the above-mentioned clinical variability. We performed a segregation analysis in 19 Italian families with a designed custom panel of 42 genes involved in immunity and virus entry and which have also been shown to be related to SARS-CoV-2 host response. We carried out both a familial segregation analysis and a global statistical analysis. In the former we identified eighteen risk variants co-segregating with a COVID-positive status and six variants with a possible protective effect. In addition, sixteen variants showed a trend of association to a severe phenotype. Together with common SNPs, we detected private rare variants that may also provide insight into the observed clinical COVID-19 heterogeneity. The global statistical analysis confirmed statistically significant positive associations between SARS-CoV-2 individual response and some specific gene variants identified in familial analysis. In conclusion our data confirm that the clinical expression of COVID-19 is markedly influenced by the host genetic profile both with a mendelian transmission pattern and a polygenic architecture."

https://openalex.org/W4305040592,"Membranous nephropathy is the commonest cause of nephrotic syndrome in non-diabetic Caucasian adults over the age of 40 years. Primary membranous nephropathy is limited to the kidneys. Clinical management aims to induce remission, either spontaneously with supportive care, or with immunosuppression. Here, we describe the natural history of this condition in a large tertiary centre in the UK.178 patients with primary membranous nephropathy were identified over 2 decades. We collected data on demographics, baseline laboratory values, treatment received and outcomes including progression to renal replacement therapy and death. Analysis was performed on the whole cohort and specific subgroups. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression was also performed.Median age was 58.3 years with 63.5% male. Median baseline creatinine was 90μmol/L and urine protein-creatinine ratio 664g/mol. Remission (partial or complete) was achieved in 134 (75.3%), either spontaneous in 60 (33.7%) or after treatment with immunosuppression in 74 (41.6%), and of these 57 (42.5%) relapsed. Progression to renal replacement therapy was seen in 10.1% (much lower than classically reported) with mortality in 29.8%. Amongst the whole cohort, those who went into remission had improved outcomes compared to those who did not go into remission (less progression to renal replacement therapy [4.5% vs 28%] and death [20.1% vs 67%]. Those classified as high-risk (based on parameters including eGFR, proteinuria, serum albumin, PLA2R antibody level, rate of renal function decline) also had worse outcomes than those at low-risk (mortality seen in 52.6% vs 10.8%, p<0.001). The median follow-up period was 59.5 months.We provide a comprehensive epidemiologic analysis of primary membranous nephropathy at a large tertiary UK centre. Only 10.1% progressed to renal replacement therapy. For novelty, the KDIGO risk classification was linked to outcomes, highlighting the utility of this classification system for identifying patients most likely to progress."
https://openalex.org/W4305082676,"In this study we explore the potential of combining traditional zooarchaeological determination and proteomic identification of morphologically non-diagnostic bone fragments (ZooMS) collected from the Uluzzian levels of three Italian sites: Uluzzo C Rock Shelter, Roccia San Sebastiano cave, and Riparo del Broion. Moreover, we obtained glutamine deamidation ratios for all the contexts analysed during routine ZooMS screening of faunal samples, giving information on collagen preservation. We designed a selection protocol that maximizes the efficiency of the proteomics analyses by excluding particularly compromised fragments (e.g. from taphonomic processes), and that aims to identify new human fragments by favouring bones showing morphological traits more similar to Homo. ZooMS consistently provided taxonomic information in agreement with the faunal spectra outlined by traditional zooarchaeology. Our approach allows us to delineate and appreciate differences between the analysed contexts, particularly between the northern and southern sites, related to faunal, environmental, and climate composition, although no human remains were identified. We reconstructed the faunal assemblage of the different sites, giving voice to morphologically undiagnostic bone fragments. Thus, the combination of these analyses provides a more complete picture of the faunal assemblage and of the paleoenvironment during the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic transition in Italy."
https://openalex.org/W4305082749,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created unprecedented pressures on healthcare systems and led to the widespread adoption of telepharmacy services, a practice that was not previously established in the state of Qatar. Objective The -study aimed to explore clinical pharmacists’ (CPs) perspectives and experiences in utilizing telepharmacy for the provision of pharmaceutical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A descriptive, qualitative approach using face-to-face focus group (FG) discussions was used. CPs across Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) were purposively invited to participate in the study. FG discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and validated. Transcripts were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Recruitment continued until a saturation point was achieved. Results We conducted five focus groups that included 23 CPs and led to seven themes. Overall, CPs reported inadequate preparedness for the practice of telepharmacy, which they perceived as challenging. The primary perceived benefits of telepharmacy were decreased infection exposure risk, improved quality of care, improved patients’ satisfaction, and enhanced workplace efficiency and productivity. The main highlighted risks of telepharmacy were related to threatened patient confidentiality, missed pharmaceutical care opportunities, and negatively impacted professional rapport with other healthcare providers; and the major perceived challenges were low digital health literacy, complex illnesses and medication regimens, lack of standardized protocols, and inadequacy of resources and cultural resistance for virtual care. Participants recommended standardization and training, resource allocation, and proper service promotion as potential facilitators of telepharmacy practice. Conclusion The current study revealed that despite perceived barriers, pharmacists identified several benefits of telepharmacy and recommended potential facilitators that should be used to integrate and sustain the practice of telepharmacy in the future. Future studies should investigate the impact of telepharmacy on clinical pharmacy interventions and patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4305040263,"Higher acuity levels in COVID-19 patients and increased infection prevention and control routines have increased the work demands on nurses. To understand and quantify these changes, discrete event simulation (DES) was used to quantify the effects of varying the number of COVID-19 patient assignments on nurse workload and quality of care. Model testing was based on the usual nurse-patient ratio of 1:5 while varying the number of COVID-19 positive patients from 0 to 5. The model was validated by comparing outcomes to a step counter field study test with eight nurses. The DES model showed that nurse workload increased, and the quality of care deteriorated as nurses were assigned more COVID-19 positive patients. With five COVID-19 positive patients, the most demanding condition, the simulant-nurse donned and doffed personal protective equipment (PPE) 106 times a shift, totaling 6.1 hours. Direct care time was reduced to 3.4 hours (-64% change from baseline pre-pandemic case). In addition, nurses walked 10.5km (+46% increase from base pre-pandemic conditions) per shift while 75 care tasks (+242%), on average, were in the task queue. This contributed to 143 missed care tasks (+353% increase from base pre-pandemic conditions), equivalent to 9.6 hours (+311%) of missed care time and care task waiting time increased to 1.2 hours (+70%), in comparison to baseline (pre-pandemic) conditions. This process simulation approach may be used as potential decision support tools in the design and management of hospitals in-patient care settings, including pandemic planning scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W4305040291,"Over 155 million children under five suffer from stunting, and it is responsible for over one million deaths and 54.9 million Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYS) of under-five children worldwide. These predominantly occurred in low-and middle-income countries like sub-Saharan Africa. Stunted children begin their lives at a marked disadvantage. Some of these are; poor cognition and educational performance, low adult wages, lost productivity and, when accompanied by excessive weight gain later in childhood, an increased risk of nutrition-related chronic diseases in adult life and the devastating effects of stunting can last a lifetime and even affect the next generation. Despite this, its magnitude rises in the past 25 years in sub-Saharan Africa. Studies that capture the pooled prevalence and associated factors of stunting among children aged 6-59 months in sub-Saharan Africa are limited. Therefore, this study was carried out on the basis of the Bayesian approach to determine the pooled prevalence and predictors of stunting among children aged 6-59 months in Sub-Saharan Africa.To assess the pooled prevalence of stunting and associated factors among children aged 6-59 months in Sub-Saharan Africa.For this study a total of 173,483 weighted samples from the demography and health survey data set of 35 sub-Saharan African countries from 2008 to 2020 were used. After checking Variation between cluster by computing Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, binary logistic regression model was conducted based on hierarchical Bayesian statistical approach to account the hierarchical nature of demography and health survey data and to get reliable estimates by using additional information from the prior distribution. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% credible interval of the best fitted model was used to ascertain the predictors.The pooled prevalence of stunting in Sub-Saharan Africa was about 35% (95%CI: 34.87, 35.31). Of the sub-regions, the highest prevalence of stunting was in East Africa, 37% (95%, CI: 36.96, 37.63) followed by Central Africa, 35% (95%CI: (34.93, 35.94). Being male (AOR = 1.27, 95% CrI 1.25, 1.30), small birth size (AOR = 1.29, CrI 1.25, 1.32), home delivery (AOR = 1.17, CrI 1.14, 1.20), and no education of mothers (AOR = 3.07, CrI 2.79, 3.39) were some of the significant predictors of stunting of children.The prevalence of stunting of children in sub-Saharan Africa is among the highest in the world. Predictors such as being male, being small at birth, a child delivered at home, and, low level of maternal education were some of the predictors of childhood stunting. Stakeholders and non-governmental organizations should consider those contributing factors of stunting when they plan and design nutritional improvement programs."
https://openalex.org/W4305040710,"Computer vision is a tool that could provide livestock producers with digital body measures and records that are important for animal health and production, namely body height and length, and chest girth. However, to build these tools, the scarcity of labeled training data sets with uniform images (pose, lighting) that also represent real-world livestock can be a challenge. Collecting images in a standard way, with manual image labeling is the gold standard to create such training data, but the time and cost can be prohibitive. We introduce the PreciseEdge image segmentation algorithm to address these issues by employing a standard image collection protocol with a semi-automated image labeling method, and a highly precise image segmentation for automated body measurement extraction directly from each image. These elements, from image collection to extraction are designed to work together to yield values highly correlated to real-world body measurements. PreciseEdge adds a brief preprocessing step inspired by chromakey to a modified GrabCut procedure to generate image masks for data extraction (body measurements) directly from the images. Three hundred RGB (red, green, blue) image samples were collected uniformly per the African Goat Improvement Network Image Collection Protocol (AGIN-ICP), which prescribes camera distance, poses, a blue backdrop, and a custom AGIN-ICP calibration sign. Images were taken in natural settings outdoors and in barns under high and low light, using a Ricoh digital camera producing JPG images (converted to PNG prior to processing). The rear and side AGIN-ICP poses were used for this study. PreciseEdge and GrabCut image segmentation methods were compared for differences in user input required to segment the images. The initial bounding box image output was captured for visual comparison. Automated digital body measurements extracted were compared to manual measures for each method. Both methods allow additional optional refinement (mouse strokes) to aid the segmentation algorithm. These optional mouse strokes were captured automatically and compared. Stroke count distributions for both methods were not normally distributed per Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Non-parametric Wilcoxon tests showed the distributions were different (p&lt; 0.001) and the GrabCut stroke count was significantly higher (p = 5.115 e -49 ), with a mean of 577.08 (std 248.45) versus 221.57 (std 149.45) with PreciseEdge. Digital body measures were highly correlated to manual height, length, and girth measures, (0.931, 0.943, 0.893) for PreciseEdge and (0.936, 0. 944, 0.869) for GrabCut (Pearson correlation coefficient). PreciseEdge image segmentation allowed for masks yielding accurate digital body measurements highly correlated to manual, real-world measurements with over 38% less user input for an efficient, reliable, non-invasive alternative to livestock hand-held direct measuring tools."

https://openalex.org/W4306154361,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an intracellular pathogen that forms aggregates (clumps) on solid agar plates and in liquid media. Detergents such as Tween 80/Tyloxapol are considered the gold standard to disrupt clump formation in Mtb cultures. The presence of detergent, however, may generate foam and hinder Mtb aerosolization thus requiring addition of an antifoam agent for optimal Mtb aerosol-based procedures. Aerosol inhalation can be technically challenging, in particular to achieve a reproducible inhaled target dose. In this study, the impact of an antifoam, the silicon antifoaming agent (SAF), on Mtb aerosolization and whole-body mouse aerosol infection was investigated. A comparative study using SAF in a liquid suspension containing Mycobacterium bovis BCG (M. bovis BCG) or Mtb H37Rv did not cause any adverse effect on bacterial viability. Incorporation of SAF during mycobacteria inhalation procedures revealed that aerosolized mycobacterial strains were maintained under controlled environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, pressure, and airflow inside the aerosol chamber. In addition, environmental factors and spray factors were not affected by the presence of SAF in mycobacterial cultures during aerosolization. Spray factor was significantly less during aerosol procedures with a low-input dose of mycobacteria in comparison to high-dose, as predicted. The mycobacterial load recovered in the biosampler (AGI) was ~2-3 logs lower than nebulizer or input bacterial load. A consistent Mtb bacillary load determined in mouse lungs indicates that SAF does not affect mycobacteria aerosolization during the aerosol generation process. These data confirmed that 1) SAF prevents formation of excessive foam during aerosolization, 2) SAF had no negative impact on mycobacterial viability within aerosol droplets, 3) Mtb droplets within aerosol-generated particles are well within the range required for reaching and depositing deep into lung tissue, and 4) SAF had no negative impact on achieving a target dose in mice exposed to Mtb aerosol."
https://openalex.org/W4305040294,"The present research was designed to test predictions derived from the action-based model of cognitive dissonance theory. These predictions were that dissonance arousal would be negatively related to effective behavior, and that dissonance reduction would be positively related to effective behavior.Dissonance arousal and reduction were measured using an individual differences questionnaire. Effective behavior was measured as amount of physical exercise obtained from an exercise app that measures exercise using GPS (cycling kilometers over one year; Study 1) and from self-reports (number of days during the previous week; Study 2-3).Results suggested that individual differences in dissonance arousal relate to less exercise and that individual differences in dissonance reduction relate to more exercise. Statistically controlling for trait approach and avoidance motivation as well as satisfaction with life revealed that dissonance processes predicted exercise behavior over these traits. This pattern of results was generally consistent across the three studies. Moreover, results from Studies 2-3 suggested possible statistical mediators from the exercise commitment literature of the relationship between trait dissonance arousal/reduction and exercise behavior.These results highlight the importance of considering dissonance processes as adaptive ones, and they suggest possible ways of increasing exercise behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4305040322,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common childhood infection that in young infants can progress into severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Disease pathogenesis results from both viral mediated and host immune processes of which alveolar macrophages play an important part. Here, we investigated the role of different types of alveolar macrophages on RSV infection using an in vitro co-culture model involving primary tissue-derived human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and human blood monocyte-derived M0-like, M1-like, or M2-like macrophages. It was hypothesized that the in vitro model would recapitulate previous in vivo findings of a protective effect of macrophages against RSV infection. It was found that macrophages maintained their phenotype for the 72-hour co-culture time period and the bronchial epithelial cells were unaffected by the macrophage media. HBEC infection with RSV was decreased by M1-like macrophages but enhanced by M0- or M2-like macrophages. The medium used during the co-culture also impacted the outcome of the infection. This work demonstrates that alveolar macrophage phenotypes may have differential roles during epithelial RSV infection, and demonstrates that an in vitro co-culture model could be used to further investigate the roles of macrophages during bronchial viral infection."

Nine proteins with a score of ≥ 20 considered as the shortlisted proteins based on the quartile scoring method, including three TonB-dependent receptors, WP_008500981.1, WP_058690971.1 and WP_058679571.1; one YjbH domain-containing protein, WP_110108068.1; three flagellar proteins, WP_088207510.1, WP_033145204.1 and WP_058679632.1; one spore-coat U domain-containing protein, WP_039266612.1; and one DD-metalloendopeptidase family protein, WP_025912449.1. In this study, proteins WP_058690971.1 and WP_110108068.1 were detected as the top candidates with regard to immune stimulation and interactions with TLRs. However, their efficacy is remaining to be evaluated experimentally. Conclusions Our investigation introduced common ferrichrome porins with high sequence similarity as potential vaccine candidates against the Enterobacteriaceae family. These proteins belong to the iron acquisition system and possess all criteria of suitable vaccine targets. Therefore, they need to be specifically paid attention for vaccine development against clinically important members of Enterobacteriaceae family."
https://openalex.org/W4305040996,"Several studies comparing resistance training (RT) frequencies may have been affected by the large between-subject variability. This study aimed to compare the changes in lower limbs maximal dynamic strength (1RM) and quadriceps femoris cross-sectional area (CSA) after a RT with different weekly frequencies in strength-trained individuals using a within-subject design. Twenty-four men participated in a 9-week RT program, being randomly divided into two conditions: resistance training with equalized total training volume (RTEV) and with unequalized total training volume (RTUV). The RT protocol used the unilateral leg press 45° exercise and each subject's lower limb executed one of the proposed frequencies (one and three times/week). All conditions effectively increased 1RM and CSA (p<0.001); however, no significant differences were observed in the values of 1RM (p = 0.454) and CSA (p = 0.310) between the RT frequencies in the RTEV and RTUV conditions. Therefore, RT performed three times a week showed similar increases in 1RM and CSA to the program performed once a week, regardless of training volume equalization. Nevertheless, when the higher RT frequency allowed the application of a greater TTV (i.e., RTUV), higher effect size (ES) values (0.51 and 0.63, 1RM and CSA, respectively) were observed for the adaptations."
https://openalex.org/W4305082689,"According to the transdiagnostic perspective, psychological disorders share common cognitive processes involved in their pathogenesis. One dysfunctional belief that has been found to be associated with several psychological disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), is perfectionism. Perfectionism comprises two factors, namely, perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns. This study aims to replicate and extend previous research in several ways. We aimed to assess similarities between the two disorders using Bayesian statistics. Furthermore, as dysfunctional beliefs are assumed to not be fully accessible by introspection, we included an indirect measure (perfectionism single category implicit association task; SC-IAT). The SC-IAT and a self-report measure of perfectionism (FMPS) was used in patients with MDD ( n = 55), OCD ( n = 55), and in healthy controls ( n = 64). In replication of previous findings, patients with MDD and OCD differed from healthy controls regarding self-reported perfectionism scores. Furthermore, Bayesian statistics showed that the two patient groups did not differ regarding perfectionistic strivings and only showed differences on perfectionistic concerns, when the doubts about actions subscale–which is also closely related to symptoms of OCD–was included. Contrary to our expectations, the SC-IAT did not discriminate groups. In conclusion, these results give further evidence that self-reported perfectionism may serve as a relevant transdiagnostic process. More studies are needed to assess implicit facets of perfectionism."
https://openalex.org/W4305082794,"Fenghuang Dancong, Tieguanyin, and Dahongpao teas are belonged to semi-fermented oolong teas and are famous for their unique aroma. However, reports regarding the systematic comparison, differentiation, and classification of the volatile components of these three types of oolong teas are lacking. In this study, we aimed to establish a method for distinguishing these three types of oolong teas. The volatile components in a total of 21 tea samples of these three types of oolong teas were extracted, determined, and identified by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In addition, chemometric methods such as hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used for distinguishing and classifying the three types of oolong teas on the basis of the similarities and differences in the volatile components. The results showed that 125 volatile components were extracted and identified from the three types of oolong teas, among which 53 volatile components overlapped among the samples. The results of HCA indicated that the samples of each of the three types of oolong teas could be placed in one category when the t value was 220. The results of PCA and OPLS-DA showed that the volatile components such as dehydrolinalool, linalool oxide II, linalool, α-farnesene, linalool oxide I, β-ocimene, nerolidol, cis-3-butyric acid folate, myrcene, and (Z)-hexanoic acid-3-hexenyl ester are the characteristic components, which can be used to distinguish the three types of oolong teas. We developed a simple, fast, and efficient method for distinguishing three types of oolong teas and provided a feasible technique for the identification of oolong tea types."
https://openalex.org/W4306154363,"Objectives Meaning-making is an important element of adapting to disease. However, this process is still poorly understood and the theoretical model has not been comprehensively verified yet, particularly in terms of complexity, dynamics, and intraindividual variability. The aim of this study is a deeper understanding of the meaning-reconstruction process in cancer and empirical verification of the integrative meaning-making model of coping extended by the psychological flexibility model. We postulate that psychological flexibility can foster the meaning-making in cancer by building more flexible and workable meaning-making explanations of disease. Design A daily-diary study conducted for 14 days in patients following the first autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Methods Participants (at least 150) will be requested to complete the daily-diary related to daily situational meaning, meaning-related distress, meaning-making, psychological flexibility, meanings made, and wellbeing for 14 days after hospital discharge following HCT. Also, baseline and follow-up assessment of global meaning, wellbeing, and meanings made will be performed. Statistical analysis of the data will be conducted using the multilevel and dynamic structural equation modeling. Conclusions The study will fill in the gaps in health psychology in the understanding of the meaning-reconstruction process in cancer by within- and between-person verification of the integrative meaning-making model and its extension by the psychological flexibility model. The data obtained will be used in further research on the development of meaning-making by means of interventions based on psychological flexibility."

Despite improvements in the national coverage rates, there is no evidence of how equal these improvements have been.To estimate inequalities in maternal healthcare use in Sierra Leone.Using cross-sectional study data from 2008, 2013, and 2019 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), we study inequalities in maternal health services by computing rate ratios, and concentration indices (as well as concentration curves) using selected inequality stratifiers such as household wealth index, maternal education, and rural/urban place of residence.We found that considerable progress has been made in increasing the uptake of maternal health services as well as reducing inequalities over time. We also found that inequalities in the selected health indicators favoured women from wealthy households, educated women, as well as women from urban areas. Although inequalities declined over time, the use of delivery services was highly unequal. However, of the selected health interventions, the use of four or more antenatal visits was almost at perfect equality in 2013 and 2019.Although efforts have been made to increase the use of maternal healthcare services among women with a lower socioeconomic status, the use of maternal health services remains favourable to women with a higher socioeconomic standing. Therefore, policy initiatives need to prioritise women of lower socioeconomic status through projects aimed at increasing women's educational levels as well as focusing on poverty reduction."
https://openalex.org/W4306154427,"Objectives The aim of this study was to elucidate the positional relationship between the courses of the angular veins and the facial muscles, and the possible roles of the latter as alternative venous valves. Methods The angular veins of 44 specimens of embalmed Korean adult cadavers were examined. Facial muscles were studied to establish their relationships with the angular vein, including the orbicularis oculi (OOc), depressor supercilii (DS), zygomaticus minor (Zmi), zygomaticus major (Zmj), and levator labii superioris (LLS). Results In the upper face of all specimens, the angular vein passed through the DS and descended to the medial palpebral ligament. In the midface, it passed between the origin of the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi (LLSAN) and the inferior OOc fibers. The vein coursed along the deep surface of the inferior margin of the OOc in all specimens. At the level of the nasal ala, the course of the angular vein was classified into three types: in type I it passed between the LLS and Zmi (38.6%), in type II it passed between the superficial and deep fibers of the Zmi (47.7%), and in type III it passed between the Zmi and Zmj (13.6%). In the lower face of all specimens, the angular or facial vein passed through the anterior lobe of the buccal fat pad. Conclusion This study found that the angular vein coursed along the sites where facial muscle contractions are assumed to efficiently compress the veins, likely controlling venous flow as valves. The observations made and analysis performed in this study will improve the understanding of the physiological function of the facial muscles as alternative venous valves."
https://openalex.org/W4305040288,"Changes in climatic conditions have increased the variability in rainfall patterns worldwide. A negative rainfall shock faced by children in the initial 1000 days of life and the resulting malnutrition can harm the likelihood of children's survival, overall growth, development of the brain, motor skills, and cognitive abilities, leading to poor performance in education and labor market. While the existing findings about the long-run outcomes are mixed, it is essential to understand the nuances in such an estimation.Using the exogenous variation in rainfall in India, we estimate the impact of adverse shocks at birth on the cognitive abilities of children at ages 5, 8, 12, and 15, on educational attainments, and the likelihood of studying STEM at higher secondary school.The Young Lives Survey data from Andhra Pradesh, India, presents evidence of the negative impact of rainfall shocks at birth on cognitive abilities from age 5 to 8, attenuating at age 12. Using nationally representative data, while we investigate the impact of adverse rainfall shocks at birth on academic performance measured by the high school grades and STEM choice at higher secondary school, we do not find a persistent impact.We unfold the impact of rainfall shocks on a chain of outcomes connected to long-run educational pursuits, as it helps to identify the most crucial stage for policymaking. Since STEM subjects are strongly associated with the labor market, connecting the association with early life shocks seems to be an essential addition to the literature. While we find evidence of reduced cognitive abilities in the early years, those do not seem to persist in the long run. The potential sample selection or attrition biases and the estimates of those biases can explain the nuances of estimating the long-run impact of adverse shocks at birth."
https://openalex.org/W4305040290,"The effect of health inequalities is determined by different socioeconomic, sex, and race conditions. This study aimed to analyze the association of tooth loss with race (defined by self-reported skin color) and sex. Based on the hypothesis that the association between tooth loss and race may be modified by sex, we also aimed to evaluate possible interactions between race and sex in association with this event, in a population-based study in the city of Campinas, Brazil. A directed acyclic graph was used to select covariates. The prevalence, of tooth loss was 19% higher in black women compared to white men (Prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.19; 95%CI: 1.05-1.34). Moreover, the prevalence of tooth loss in black women was 26% higher than in white women (PR: 1.26; 95%CI: 1.13-1.42); and, within the strata of black people, black women had 14% higher dental loss (PR: 1.14; 95%CI: 1.02-1.27) compared to black men. This study found a significant interaction between race and sex in tooth loss, with a disadvantage for black women. In addition, this work contributes to the discussion of health inequities and can support policies for the provision of universal dental care."
https://openalex.org/W4305040293,"Immunotherapy is now considered as the new pillar in treatment of cancer patients. Dendritic cells (DCs) play an essential role in stimulating anti-tumor immune responses, as they are capable of cross-presenting exogenous tumor antigens in MHCI complexes to activate naïve CD8+ T cells. Analgesics, like non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are frequently given to cancer patients to help relieve pain, however little is known about their impact on DC function.Here, we investigated the effect of the NSAIDs diclofenac, ibuprofen and celecoxib on the three key processes of DCs required for proper CD8+ cytotoxic T cell induction: antigen cross-presentation, co-stimulatory marker expression, and cytokine production.Our results show that TLR-induced pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine excretion by human monocyte derived and murine bone-marrow derived DCs is diminished after NSAID exposure.These results indicate that various NSAIDs can affect DC function and warrant further investigation into the impact of NSAIDs on DC priming of T cells and cancer immunotherapy efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W4305040318,"The Philippine government significantly raised cigarette excise taxes in 2013, following passage of the landmark Sin Tax Reform Act of 2012. As a result, cigarette prices increased substantially. Given varying smokers’ responses to the price increase, we examined underlying typologies of Filipino smokers and assessed how these typologies determine smoking intensity. We used cross-sectional data from the 2015 wave of the Philippine Global Adult Tobacco Survey (N = 1,651). To uncover typologies, random effects latent class modelling was used on six individual smoker responses (attempting to stop, thinking about quitting, decreasing sticks smoked, switching to cheaper brands, buying in bulk, and asking from others). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were employed to uncover determinants of typologies and smoking intensity. We found two typologies based on smokers’ response. The first group, called “potential quitters” (62.62%), is composed of smokers who are more likely to consider quitting and decrease sticks smoked. The second group, called “unlikely to quit” (37.38%), have smokers who opt for price-minimization strategies like switching to cheaper brands, buying in bulk, or asking cigarettes from others. Potential quitters tend to be female, a student, and less nicotine dependent. They smoke up to three fewer sticks than those unlikely to quit, controlling for other factors. Nicotine dependence stood out as the most important predictor of being in the unlikely to quit group. The dominant role of nicotine dependence in determining a smoker’s typology points to the need for non-price based measures, such as those targeted towards highly-nicotine dependent smokers, to complement tax-induced price increases and comprehensively address the smoking problem."
https://openalex.org/W4305040489,"Members of the Bacillus genus are industrial cell factories due to their capacity to secrete significant quantities of biomolecules with industrial applications. The Bacillus paralicheniformis strain Bac84 was isolated from the Red Sea and it shares a close evolutionary relationship with Bacillus licheniformis . However, a significant number of proteins in its genome are annotated as functionally uncharacterized hypothetical proteins. Investigating these proteins’ functions may help us better understand how bacteria survive extreme environmental conditions and to find novel targets for biotechnological applications. Therefore, the purpose of our research was to functionally annotate the hypothetical proteins from the genome of B . paralicheniformis strain Bac84. We employed a structured in-silico approach incorporating numerous bioinformatics tools and databases for functional annotation, physicochemical characterization, subcellular localization, protein-protein interactions, and three-dimensional structure determination. Sequences of 414 hypothetical proteins were evaluated and we were able to successfully attribute a function to 37 hypothetical proteins. Moreover, we performed receiver operating characteristic analysis to assess the performance of various tools used in this present study. We identified 12 proteins having significant adaptational roles to unfavorable environments such as sporulation, formation of biofilm, motility, regulation of transcription, etc. Additionally, 8 proteins were predicted with biotechnological potentials such as coenzyme A biosynthesis, phenylalanine biosynthesis, rare-sugars biosynthesis, antibiotic biosynthesis, bioremediation, and others. Evaluation of the performance of the tools showed an accuracy of 98% which represented the rationality of the tools used. This work shows that this annotation strategy will make the functional characterization of unknown proteins easier and can find the target for further investigation. The knowledge of these hypothetical proteins’ potential functions aids B . paralicheniformis strain Bac84 in effectively creating a new biotechnological target. In addition, the results may also facilitate a better understanding of the survival mechanisms in harsh environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4305040490,"Major storms can alter coastal ecosystems in several direct and indirect ways including habitat destruction, stormwater-related water quality degradation, and organism mortality. From 2010–2020, ten tropical cyclones impacted coastal North Carolina, providing an opportunity to explore ecosystem responses across multiple storms. Using monthly trawl and contemporaneous seagrass surveys conducted in Back Sound, NC, we evaluated how cyclones may affect the nursery role of shallow-water biogenic habitats by examining seagrass-associated fish responses within a temperate-subtropical estuary. We employed a general before-after-control-impact approach using trawls conducted prior (before) and subsequent (after) to storm arrival and years either without (control) or with (impact) storms. We examined whether effects were apparent over short (within ~three weeks of impact) and seasonal (May-October) timescales, as well as if the magnitude of storm-related shifts varied as a function of storm intensity. Our findings suggest that the ability of these shallow-water habitats to support juvenile fishes was not dramatically altered by hurricanes. The resilience exhibited by fishes was likely underpinned by the relative persistence of the seagrass habitat, which appeared principally undamaged by storms based upon review of available–albeit limited seagrass surveys. Increasing cyclone intensity, however, was correlated with greater declines in catch and may potentially underlie the emigration and return rate of fish after cyclones. Whether estuarine fishes will continue to be resilient to acute storm impacts despite chronic environmental degradation and predicted increases major tropical cyclone frequency and intensity remains a pressing question."

https://openalex.org/W4305040988,"Shortspine thornyhead ( Sebastolobus alaskanus ) are a benthic, deepwater species in the family Scorpaenidae . They have been tagged annually in Alaska since 1992, but have a low tag return rate of 1.6%. This may be at least partially attributed to post-release mortality related to capture. In this study, 21 shortspine thornyhead were caught on bottom hook-and-line longline gear and immediately given reflex tests. Eighteen were transported to the laboratory and held for 10–42 days, given reflex tests again, and then given postmortem examinations, including histopathology of tissues; three were given postmortem examinations after reflex tests on the vessel. There were no histological findings that could be directly linked to capture and holding; however, there were occurrences of myxozoan (protozoa) and metazoan (nematode) parasites, sometimes associated with minor inflammation. The vibration response reflex was found in only 24% of fish on deck and in 56% of fish after holding in the laboratory. The vestibular-ocular response was present in 47% of fish on deck and 89% of fish in the laboratory. A fish’s ability to right itself was successful on deck in 43% of fish (an additional 19% responded slowly) and 100% in the laboratory. Some reflex impairments may be permanent or may take more than days or weeks to improve. Reflex responses to other tests, the tail grab, gag, and operculum flare, were 95–100% successful on deck and later in the laboratory. A lack of reflexes may increase the risk of predation after release and may affect other behaviors related to survival and productivity."
https://openalex.org/W4305040989,"Successive plantings of Prunus species produce suboptimal growth and yield in many California soils due to a poorly understood soilborne disease complex, Prunus replant disease (PRD). We explored the hypothesis that PRD is mediated by microbial taxa in roots of Nemaguard peach, a rootstock for almond and other stone fruits. In a greenhouse bioassay, portions of 10 replant soils were treated with fumigation or pasteurization or left untreated as a control before being planted with peach seedlings. Ten weeks after planting, seedlings were considered PRD-affected if their top fresh weights in the control were significantly reduced, compared to the weights in pasteurization and fumigation treatments; plants with equivalent top weights in all treatments were considered to be non-affected. The roots were washed from the soil, frozen, extracted for total DNA, and used for metabarcoding of rRNA gene amplicons from bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes. High-throughput amplicon sequencing revealed that root microbial community shifts resulted from preplant treatments, and specific taxa were associated with PRD induction among controls. Random forest (RF) analysis discriminated effectively between PRD-affected and non-affected root communities. Among the 30 RF top-ranked amplicon sequence variant (ASV) predictors, 26 were bacteria, two were oomycetes, and two were fungi. Among them, only Streptomyces scabiei, Steroidobacter denitrificans, Streptomyces bobili, and Pythium mamillatum had root abundances ≥5% that were either associated positively (former two ASVs) or negatively (latter two) with PRD. Thus, our findings were consistent with microbial mediation of PRD in roots and suggested taxa that may be involved in the mediation."

We determined the incidence and predictors of LTFUP among people living with HIV (PLHIV) on ART in Nyarugenge the Central Business District of Kigali city.A cohort of PLHIV who initiated ART in 2018 was retrospectively studied for 24 months. Using health facility records, a person who had no record of contact with the health facility for at least three consecutive months was considered LTFUP. LTFUP incidence rates were computed, and the Fine-Gray's competing risk regression models were used to determine factors associated with time to first LTFUP. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to analyze repeated measurement outcomes of LTFUP and predictors of LTFUP.Of 950 participants, 581 (61.2%) were females and 866 (91.2%) were 15 to 49 years old. From 1,586.1 person years of observation (pyo), 148 participants got LTFUP for 451 times. The incidence rate to first event was 9.4 per 100 pyo (95%CI:7.9-10.9) and 31.8 per 100 pyo (95%CI:29.0-34.4) to multiple events. WHO stage, marital status, employment status and person to contact when PLHIV is not reachable were associated with time to first LTFUP event. However, an average participant with a contact person who was not a Community Health Worker (CHW) or a peer educator had higher incidence of LTUP (aIRR = 2.69, 95%CI: 1.43-5.06), an average single patients had higher incidence of LTFUP (aIRR = 1.74, 95%CI: 1.28-2.34) compared to married/co-habiting, and an average self-employed had higher incidence of LTFUP (aIRR = 1.51, 95%CI: 1.14-2.01) compared to participants employed by others. Furthermore, an average PLHIV living out-of-the health facility catchment area had higher incidence of LTFUP (aIRR = 1.55, 95%CI: 1.19-2.01) compared to an average PLHIV living in the health facility catchment area whereas, an average children initiated on first line had lower incidence of LTUP (aIRR = 0.43, 95%CI: 0.21-0.86) compared to adults.Using CHW and peer educators as contact persons can help to reduce LTFUP while, targeted sensitization and service delivery are needed for single, self-employed and, patients living out of the health facility catchment area."
https://openalex.org/W4305041094,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic joint disease which increases in frequency with age eventually impacting most people over the age of 65. OA is the leading cause of disability and impaired mobility, yet the pathogenesis of OA remains unclear. Treatments have focused mainly on pain relief and reducing joint swelling. Currently there are no effective treatments to slow the progression of the disease and to prevent irreversible loss of cartilage. Here we demonstrate that stable expression of RORβ in cultured cells results in alteration of a gene program that is supportive of chondrogenesis and is protective against development of OA. Specifically, we determined that RORβ alters the ratio of expression of the FGF receptors FGFR1 (associated with cartilage destruction) and FGFR3 (associated with cartilage protection). Additionally, ERK1/2-MAPK signaling was suppressed and AKT signaling was enhanced. These results suggest a critical role for RORβ in chondrogenesis and suggest that identification of mechanisms that control the expression of RORβ in chondrocytes could lead to the development of disease modifying therapies for the treatment of OA."

Anti-inflammatory activities of fermented rice cake made of strawberry powder as well as rice powder were evaluated. The fermented rice cake containing strawberry powder (SRC) significantly and dose-dependently inhibited NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells without cytotoxicity. Also, SRC effectively suppressed inflammatory gene expression, including iNOS, COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. In addition, the production of PGE2, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α was significantly reduced. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effect of SRC was investigated using carrageenan-induced paw edema of ICR mice. It was demonstrated that pre-orally administration of SRC at a dose of 50 and 100 mg/kg BW significantly inhibited paw edema induced by carrageenan. This study suggested that the anti-inflammation activities of strawberry rice cake give the potential for increasing the commercialization of rice cake and rice products."

Diagnosis of TBL is challenging because of the paucibacillary nature of the disease.To investigate the diagnostic potential of a new antigen detection test based on the detection of M. tuberculosis complex specific antigen MPT64 from fine needle aspirate (FNA) cytology smears and biopsies obtained from patients with clinically suspected TBL using immunohistochemistry (IHC).This study was conducted at Khyber Teaching Hospital and Rehman Medical Institute, Peshawar, Pakistan, from January 2018 to April 2019. Samples, including FNA (n = 100) and biopsies (n = 8), were collected from 100 patients with presumptive TBL. Direct smears and cell blocks were prepared from the FNA samples. All samples were subjected to hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining, and immunostaining with polyclonal anti-MPT64 antibody. The culture was performed only for biopsy specimens. All patients were followed until the completion of anti-TB treatment. The response to treatment was included in the composite reference standard (CRS) and used as the gold standard to validate the diagnostic tests.The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for ZN staining were 4.4%,100%,100%,56%, for culture were 66%,100%,100%,50%, for cytomorphology were 100%,90.91%,90%,100%, and for immunostaining with anti-MPT64 were all 100%,respectively. The morphology and performance of immunohistochemistry were better with cell blocks than with smears.MPT64 antigen detection test performed better than ZN and cytomorphology in diagnosing TBL. This test applied to cell blocks from FNA is robust, simple, and relatively rapid, and improves the diagnosis of TBL."
