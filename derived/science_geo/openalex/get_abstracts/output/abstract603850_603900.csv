https://openalex.org/W2785501747,"Epidural electrical stimulation of the lumbar spinal cord is currently regaining momentum as a neuromodulation intervention in spinal cord injury (SCI) to modify dysregulated sensorimotor functions and augment residual motor capacity. There is ample evidence that it engages spinal circuits through the electrical stimulation of large-to-medium diameter afferent fibers within lumbar and upper sacral posterior roots. Recent pilot studies suggested that the surface electrode-based method of transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (SCS) may produce similar neuromodulatory effects as caused by epidural SCS. Neurophysiological and computer modeling studies proposed that this noninvasive technique stimulates posterior-root fibers as well, likely activating similar input structures to the spinal cord as epidural stimulation. Here, we add a yet missing piece of evidence substantiating this assumption. We conducted in-depth analyses and direct comparisons of the electromyographic (EMG) characteristics of short-latency responses in multiple leg muscles to both stimulation techniques derived from ten individuals with SCI each. Post-activation depression of responses evoked by paired pulses applied either epidurally or transcutaneously confirmed the reflex nature of the responses. The muscle responses to both techniques had the same latencies, EMG peak-to-peak amplitudes, and waveforms, except for smaller responses with shorter onset latencies in the triceps surae muscle group and shorter offsets of the responses in the biceps femoris muscle during epidural stimulation. Responses obtained in three subjects tested with both methods at different time points had near-identical waveforms per muscle group as well as same onset latencies. The present results strongly corroborate the activation of common neural input structures to the lumbar spinal cord—predominantly primary afferent fibers within multiple posterior roots—by both techniques and add to unraveling the basic mechanisms underlying electrical SCS."
https://openalex.org/W2792457101,"Congenital Zika virus (ZIKV) infection impacts fetal development and pregnancy outcomes. We infected a pregnant rhesus macaque with a Puerto Rican ZIKV isolate in the first trimester. The pregnancy was complicated by preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), intraamniotic bacterial infection and fetal demise 49 days post infection (gestational day 95). Significant pathology at the maternal-fetal interface included acute chorioamnionitis, placental infarcts, and leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the myometrial radial arteries. ZIKV RNA was disseminated throughout fetal tissues and maternal immune system tissues at necropsy, as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR for viral RNA. Replicating ZIKV was identified in fetal tissues, maternal uterus, and maternal spleen by fluorescent in situ hybridization for viral replication intermediates. Fetal ocular pathology included a choroidal coloboma, suspected anterior segment dysgenesis, and a dysplastic retina. This is the first report of ocular pathology and prolonged viral replication in both maternal and fetal tissues following congenital ZIKV infection in a rhesus macaque. PPROM followed by fetal demise and severe pathology of the visual system have not been described in macaque congenital ZIKV infection previously. While this case of ZIKV infection during pregnancy was complicated by bacterial infection with PPROM, the role of ZIKV on this outcome cannot be precisely defined, and further nonhuman primate studies will determine if increased risk for PPROM or other adverse pregnancy outcomes are associated with congenital ZIKV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2787627929,"Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) was developed to move beyond single species management by incorporating ecosystem considerations for the sustainable utilization of marine resources. Due to the wide range of fishery characteristics, including different goals of fisheries management across regions and species, theoretical best practices for EBFM vary greatly. Here we highlight the lack of consensus in the interpretation of EBFM amongst professionals in marine science and its implementation. Fisheries policy-makers and managers, stock assessment scientists, conservationists, and ecologists had very different opinions on the degree to which certain management strategies would be considered EBFM. We then assess the variability of the implementation of EBFM, where we created a checklist of characteristics typifying EBFM and scored fisheries across different regions, species, ecosystems, and fishery size and capacity. Our assessments show fisheries are unlikely to meet all the criteria on the EBFM checklist. Consequentially, it is unnecessary for management to practice all the traits of EBFM, as some may be disparate from the ecosystem attributes or fishery goals. Instead, incorporating some ecosystem-based considerations to fisheries management that are context-specific is a more realistic and useful way for EBFM to occur in practice."
https://openalex.org/W2790104243,"Low-back pain (LBP) has been correlated to the presence of intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration on T2-weighted (T2w) MRI. It remains challenging, however, to accurately stage degenerative disc disease (DDD) based on T2w MRI and measurements of IVD height, particularly for early DDD. Several quantitative MRI techniques have been introduced to detect changes in matrix composition signifying early DDD. In this study, we correlated quantitative T2, T1rho and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) values to disc mechanical behavior and gold standard early DDD markers in a graded degenerated lumbar IVD caprine model, to assess their potential for early DDD detection.Lumbar caprine IVDs were injected with either 0.25 U/ml or 0.5 U/ml Chondroïtinase ABC (Cabc) to trigger early DDD-like degeneration. Injection with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) served as control. IVDs were cultured in a bioreactor for 20 days under axial physiological loading. High-resolution 9.4 T MR images were obtained prior to intervention and after culture. Quantitative MR results were correlated to recovery behavior, histological degeneration grading, and the content of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and water.Cabc-injected IVDs showed aberrancies in biomechanics and loss of GAGs without changes in water-content. All MR sequences detected changes in matrix composition, with T1rho showing largest changes pre-to-post in the nucleus, and significantly more than T2 and ADC. Histologically, degeneration due to Cabc injection was mild. T1rho nucleus values correlated strongest with altered biomechanics, histological degeneration score, and loss of GAGs.T2- and T1rho quantitative MR-mapping detected early DDD changes. T1rho nucleus values correlated better than T2 and ADC with biomechanical, histological, and GAG changes. Clinical implementation of quantitative MRI, T1rho particularly, could aid in distinguishing DDD more reliably at an earlier stage in the degenerative process."
https://openalex.org/W2793725330,"Wheat is an important dietary source of zinc (Zn) and other mineral elements in many countries. Dietary Zn deficiency is widespread, especially in developing countries, and breeding (genetic biofortification) through the HarvestPlus programme has recently started to deliver new wheat varieties to help alleviate this problem in South Asia. To better understand the potential of wheat to alleviate dietary Zn deficiency, this study aimed to characterise the baseline effects of genotype (G), site (E), and genotype by site interactions (GxE) on grain Zn concentration under a wide range of soil conditions in India. Field experiments were conducted on a diverse panel of 36 Indian-adapted wheat genotypes, grown on a range of soil types (pH range 4.5–9.5), in 2013–14 (five sites) and 2014–15 (six sites). Grain samples were analysed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The mean grain Zn concentration of the genotypes ranged from 24.9–34.8 mg kg-1, averaged across site and year. Genotype and site effects were associated with 10% and 6% of the overall variation in grain Zn concentration, respectively. Whilst G x E interaction effects were evident across the panel, some genotypes had consistent rankings between sites and years. Grain Zn concentration correlated positively with grain concentrations of iron (Fe), sulphur (S), and eight other elements, but did not correlate negatively with grain yield, i.e. no yield dilution was observed. Despite a relatively small contribution of genotype to the overall variation in grain Zn concentration, due to experiments being conducted across many contrasting sites and two years, our data are consistent with reports that biofortifying wheat through breeding is likely to be effective at scale given that some genotypes performed consistently across diverse soil types. Notably, all soils in this study were probably Zn deficient and interactions between wheat genotypes and soil Zn availability/management (e.g. the use of Zn-containing fertilisers) need to be better-understood to improve Zn supply in food systems."
https://openalex.org/W2789655310,"Introduction The association between education and wealth, as fundamental determinants of health, and smoking is well-established. Yet, social inequalities have received little attention in the expanding field of tobacco research in the Arab region. In this study, we examine inequalities in cigarette smoking by education and wealth in four Arab countries. Methods Utilizing the most recently available population-level data sets (Syria 2009 PAPFAM, Jordan 2012 DHS, Palestine 2010 Family Health Survey, and Lebanon 2004 PAPFAM), we tested the association between cigarette smoking and education and wealth–controlling for age, marital status, and region of residence–for each country, and among men and women depending on data availability. Results Cigarette smoking prevalence among Arab men is high– 51.3% in Syria, 39.7% in Palestine, and 42.1% in Lebanon; among women, prevalence is 8.4% in Syria, 10.9% in Jordan, and 24.3% Lebanon. Cigarette smoking shows the expected patterns inequalities by education among men in Syria, Palestine, and Lebanon, and among women in Jordan and Lebanon. On the other hand, wealth does not show a clear pattern in its association with cigarette smoking and, in some cases (men in Palestine and women in Syria) the behavioral risk is higher among the wealthiest. Conclusions Available data from 2004–2012 show that cigarette smoking among men and women in the four Arab countries is predominant among those with limited access to education as a fundamental cause. The weak or absent negative association between wealth and cigarette smoking suggests that access to material resources does not precipitate a reduction in the consumption of tobacco."
https://openalex.org/W2785473874,"Introduction The pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia in patients with sepsis is not fully understood. The aims of this study were to investigate changes in thrombopoietic activity over time by using absolute immature platelet counts (AIPC) and to examine the impact of platelet production on thrombocytopenia and mortality in patients with sepsis. Methods This retrospective observational study included adult patients with sepsis admitted to the intensive care unit at a university hospital. Two hundred five consecutive sepsis patients were stratified into four groups according to nadir platelet count: severe (nadir ≤40×103/μL), moderate (41–80×103/μL), or mild thrombocytopenia (81–120×103/μL), or normal-increased platelet count (>120×103/μL). The development of thrombocytopenia was assessed during the first week; mortality was assessed at day 28. Result Of the 205 patients included, 61 (29.8%) developed severe thrombocytopenia. On admission, AIPC did not differ among the four groups. In patients with severe thrombocytopenia, AIPC decreased significantly from days 2 to 7, but remained within or above the normal range in the other three groups (overall group comparison, P<0.0001). Multivariate analysis including coagulation biomarkers revealed that AIPC was independently associated with the development of severe thrombocytopenia (day 3 AIPC, odds ratio 0.49 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35–0.66], P<0.0001; day 5 AIPC, 0.59 [95% CI 0.45–0.75], P<0.0001). AIPC was a significant predictor of 28-day mortality in Cox hazard models adjusted for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores (day 3 AIPC, hazard ratio 0.70 [95% CI 0.52–0.89], P = 0.0029; day 5 AIPC, 0.68 [95% CI 0.49–0.87], P = 0.0012). Conclusions Thrombopoietic activity was generally maintained in the acute phase of sepsis. However, a decrease in AIPC after admission was independently associated with the development of severe thrombocytopenia and mortality, suggesting the importance of suppressed thrombopoiesis in the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia."
https://openalex.org/W2787520364,"Pathogens frequently associated with multi-drug resistant (MDR) phenotypes, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) and Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from horses admitted to horse clinics, pose a risk for animal patients and personnel in horse clinics. To estimate current rates of colonization, a total of 341 equine patients were screened for carriage of zoonotic indicator pathogens at hospital admission. Horses showing clinical signs associated with colic (n = 233) or open wounds (n = 108) were selected for microbiological examination of nostril swabs, faecal samples and wound swabs taken from the open wound group. The results showed alarming carriage rates of Gram-negative MDR pathogens in equine patients: 10.7% (34 of 318) of validated faecal specimens were positive for ESBL-E (94%: ESBL-producing Escherichia coli), with recorded rates of 10.5% for the colic and 11% for the open wound group. 92.7% of the ESBL-producing E. coli were phenotypically resistant to three or more classes of antimicrobials. A. baumannii was rarely detected (0.9%), and all faecal samples investigated were negative for Salmonella, both directly and after two enrichment steps. Screening results for the equine nostril swabs showed detection rates for ESBL-E of 3.4% among colic patients and 0.9% in the open wound group, with an average rate of 2.6% (9/340) for both indications. For all 41 ESBL-producing E. coli isolated, a broad heterogeneity was revealed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns and whole genome sequencing (WGS) -analysis. However, a predominance of sequence type complex (STC)10 and STC1250 was observed, including several novel STs. The most common genes associated with ESBL-production were identified as blaCTX-M-1 (31/41; 75.6%) and blaSHV-12 (24.4%). The results of this study reveal a disturbingly large fraction of multi-drug resistant and ESBL-producing E. coli among equine patients, posing a clear threat to established hygiene management systems and work-place safety of veterinary staff in horse clinics."
https://openalex.org/W2793380307,"Objectives To investigate the association between delirium motor subtypes and hospital mortality and 12-month mortality in hospitalized older adults. Design Prospective cohort study conducted from 2009 to 2015. Setting Geriatric ward of a university hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Participants We included 1,409 consecutive admissions of acutely ill patients aged 60 years and over. We excluded admissions for end-of-life care, with missing data on the main variables, length of stay shorter than 48 hours, or when consent to participate was not given. Main outcomes and measures Delirium was detected using the Confusion Assessment Method and categorized in hypoactive, hyperactive, or mixed delirium. Primary outcomes were time to death in the hospital, and time to death in 12 months (for the discharged sample). Comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed at admission and included socio-demographic, clinical, functional, cognitive, and laboratory variables. Further clinical data were documented upon death or discharge. Multivariate analyses used Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for possible confounders. Results We included 1,409 admissions, with a mean age of 80 years. The proportion of in-hospital deaths was 19%, with a cumulative mortality of 38% in 12 months. Delirium occurred in 47% of the admissions. Hypoactive delirium was the predominant motor subtype (53%), followed by mixed delirium (30%) and hyperactive delirium (17%). Hospital mortality rates were respectively 33%, 34% and 15%. We verified that hypoactive and mixed delirium were independently associated with hospital mortality, with respective hazard ratios of 2.43 (95%CI = 1.64–3.59) and 2.31 (95%CI = 1.53–3.50). Delirium motor subtypes were not independently predictive of 12-month mortality. Conclusions One in three acutely ill hospitalized older adults who suffered hypoactive or mixed delirium died in the hospital. Clinicians should be aware that hypoactive symptoms of delirium, whether shown exclusively or in alternation with hyperactive symptoms, are indicative of a worse prognosis in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2792174894,"Background Lactoferrin (LF), a member of the transferrin family, recently has been demonstrated to have anticancer effects on various cancers including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of its effects on OSCC. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the mechanism of the suppressive effects of bovine LF (bLF) on the growth of OSCC cells. Methods In the current study, HSC2, HSC3, HSC4 and normal human oral keratinocytes (RT7) cell lines were tested with bLF 1, 10, and 100 μg/ml. The effects and detail mechanisms of bLF on proliferation and apoptosis of cells were investigated using flow cytometry and western blotting. Results We found that bLF (1, 10, and 100 μg/ml) induced activation of p53, a tumor suppressor gene, is associated with the induction of cell cycle arrest in G1/S phase and apoptosis in OSCC. Moreover, bLF downregulated the phosphorylation of Akt and activated suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), thereby attenuating multiple signaling pathways including mTOR/S6K and JAK/STAT3. Interestingly, we revealed that bLF exerted its effect selectively against HSC3 but not on RT7 via different effects on the phosphorylation status of NF-κB and Akt. Conclusion This is the first report showing that bLF selectively suppresses proliferation through mTOR/S6K and JAK/STAT3 pathways and induction of apoptosis in OSCC. This study provides important new findings, which might be useful in the prevention and treatment of OSCC."
https://openalex.org/W2794156755,"The aim was the assessment of the polyphenol estimated intake and dietary sources among older adults from Mallorca Island. The study was carried out (2013-2014) in 211 participants dwelling women (n = 112) and men (n = 99). Polyphenol intake was calculated from two non-consecutive 24-h recall diets using the Polyphenol Explorer. The mean daily intake of polyphenol was 332.7 mg/d (SD: 237.9; median: 299 mg/d). Highest polyphenol intake was observed among females, 64-67 y.o. people, higher income and educational level, alcohol consumers, and physically active people. Most polyphenols consumed were flavonoids, and among them the major subclass was flavanols. Alcoholic beverages were the major contributors to the total polyphenol intake (118.3 mg/d, SD: 127.5), and red wine contributed 17.7% of total polyphenols consumed. Polyphenol intake was highest among alcohol drinkers, high educational level, high income, and physical active people. Flavonoids were the highest ingested polyphenols. Alcoholic beverages were the major contributors to the total polyphenol intake, mainly red wine."
https://openalex.org/W2977887798,"Background and aim HIV-infected individuals are at high risk of developing nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a leading cause of end-stage liver disease in Western countries. Nonetheless, due to the invasiveness of liver biopsy, NASH remains poorly understood in HIV mono-infection. We aimed to characterize the prevalence and predictors of NASH in unselected HIV mono-infected patients by means of non-invasive diagnostic tools. Methods HIV-infected adults without significant alcohol intake or co-infection with hepatitis B or C underwent a routine screening program employing transient elastography (TE) with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and the serum biomarker cytokeratin-18 (CK-18). NASH was diagnosed non-invasively as the coexistence of fatty liver (CAP ≥248 dB/m) and CK-18 >246 U/L. Identified cases of NASH were offered a diagnostic liver biopsy. Predictors of NASH were determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results 202 consecutive HIV mono-infected patients were included. NASH was non-invasively diagnosed in 23 cases (11.4%). Among them, 17 underwent a liver biopsy, and histology confirmed NASH in all cases. The prevalence of NASH was higher in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (17.1%), insulin resistance defined by homeostasis model for assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (25%), those with detectable HIV viral load (42.9%) and those with elevated ALT (53.6%). After adjustment, higher HOMA-IR (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.20, 95% CI 1.01–1.43; p = 0.03) and ALT (aOR = 2.39, 95% CI 1.50–3.79; p<0.001) were independent predictors of NASH. Conclusions NASH, diagnosed by a non-invasive diagnostic approach employing CK-18 and TE with CAP, is common in unselected HIV mono-infected individuals, particularly in the presence of insulin resistance and elevated ALT."
https://openalex.org/W2792123974,"While flavonoid metabolism’s regulation under light conditions by structural genes and transcription factors is understood, the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in this pathway have been rarely reported. In this paper, the accurate control of light was firstly enabled through the specially designed plant growth chamber which ensures consistency and accuracy of the cultivation of longan ECs and the repeatability of the experiments. Then, longan ECs were cultured in this chamber for 25 days. The change of growth rate of longan ECs was compared under different light qualities (dark, blue, green, white, green), intensities (16, 32, 64, 128, 256 μmol ·m-2 ·s-1), and durations (8 h, 12 h, 16 h, 20h, 24h). Results indicated that longan ECs had a high growth rate in the condition of blue or green light, at intensity ranged from 16 μmol·m-2·s-1 to 64 μmol·m-2·s-1, and duration from 8 h to 16 h. In addition, the contents of total flavonoids, rutin, and epicatechin were determined. Results indicated that flavonoid contents of longan ECs reached the highest value under blue light, at 32 μmol·m-2·s-1 and 12h/d. Blue light promoted the accumulation of epicatechin, but inhibited the synthesis of rutin. Finally, the expressions of flavonoid pathway genes, miRNAs and target genes were analyzed by qPCR. These results indicated that miR393 and its target gene DlTIR1-3, miR394 and its target gene DlAlMT12, and miR395 and its target gene DlAPS1 had a negative regulating relationship under blue light in longan ECs. Furthermore, miR393, miR394, and miR395 acted on target genes, which negatively regulated flavonoid key genes DlFLS and positively regulated key genes DlCHS, DlCHI, DlF3′H, DlDFR, DlLAR, and finally affected the accumulation of flavonoids. The treatment of longan ECs under the blue light at the intensity of 32 μmol·m-2·s-1 for 12 h/d inhibited the expression of miR393, miR394 and miR395, which promoted the expression of target genes and the accumulation of flavonoids and epicatechin, but inhibited the synthesis of rutin."
https://openalex.org/W2787023825,"Regular physical activity and physical fitness are closely related to a positive health status in humans. In this context, the muscle becomes more important due to its function as an endocrine organ. Muscle tissue secretes ""myokines"" in response to physical activity and it is speculated that these myokines are involved in physical activity induced positive health effects. Recently, the newly discovered myokine Irisin thought to be secreted by the muscle in response to physical activity and might be related to the health inducing effect by inducing browning of white adipose tissue. Speculating that myokines at least partly mediate exercise related health effects one would assume that regular physical activity and physical fitness are associated with resting Irisin concentrations in healthy humans. To investigate the association between resting Irisin concentration and either short-term physical activity, habitual physical activity, or physical fitness, data of 300 healthy participants from the cross-sectional KarMeN-study were analyzed. By applying different activity measurements we determined short-term and habitual physical activity, as well as physical fitness. Fasting serum samples were collected to determine resting Irisin concentrations by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay. Multivariate linear regression analysis served to investigate associations of the individual physical activity parameters with Irisin concentrations. Therefore, lean body mass and total fat mass (both determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) as well as age and parameters of glucose metabolism were included as confounders in multivariate linear regression analysis. Results showed that Irisin serum concentrations were not related to measures of physical activity and physical fitness in healthy humans under resting conditions, irrespective of the applied methods. Therefore we assume that if physical activity related effects are partly induced by myokines, permanently increased Irisin serum concentration may not be necessary to induce health-related exercise effects."
https://openalex.org/W2791185394,"Removal of toxic Cr(VI) by microbial reduction is a promising approach to reducing its ecotoxicological impact. To develop bioremediation technologies, many studies have evaluated the application of microorganisms isolated from Cr(VI)-contaminated sites. Nonetheless, little attention has been given to microbes from the environments without a history of Cr(VI) contamination. In this study, we aimed to characterize the Cr(VI) tolerance and removal abilities of a filamentous fungus strain, SL2, isolated from indoor air. Based on phenotypic characterization and rDNA sequence analysis, SL2 was identified as Penicillium oxalicum, a species that has not been extensively studied regarding Cr(VI) tolerance and reduction abilities. SL2 showed high tolerance to Cr(VI) on solid and in liquid media, facilitating its application to Cr(VI)-contaminated environments. Growth curves of SL2 in the presence of 0, 100, 400, or 1000 mg/L Cr(VI) were well simulated by the modified Gompertz model. The relative maximal colony diameter and maximal growth rate decreased as Cr(VI) concentration increased, while the lag time increased. SL2 manifested remarkable efficacy of removing Cr(VI). Mass balance analysis indicated that SL2 removed Cr(VI) by reduction, and incorporated 0.79 mg of Cr per gram of dry biomass. In electroplating wastewater, the initial rate of Cr(VI) removal was affected by the initial contaminant concentration. In conclusion, P. oxalicum SL2 represents a promising new candidate for Cr(VI) removal. Our results significantly expand the knowledge on potential application of this microorganism."
https://openalex.org/W2791479024,"Smoking is a common risk factor for both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and osteoporosis. In patients with COPD, severe emphysema is a risk factor for vertebral fracture; however, the effects of smoking or emphysema on bone health remain largely unknown. We report bone deterioration in a mouse model of emphysema induced by nose-only cigarette smoke (CS) exposure. Unexpectedly, short-term exposure for 4-weeks decreased bone turnover and increased bone volume in mice. However, prolonged exposure for 20- and 40-weeks reversed the effects from suppression to promotion of bone resorption. This long-term CS exposure increased osteoclast number and impaired bone growth, while it increased bone volume. Strikingly, long-term CS exposure deteriorated bone quality of the lumbar vertebrae as illustrated by disorientation of collagen fibers and the biological apatite c-axis. This animal model may provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the deterioration of bone quality in pulmonary emphysema caused by smoking."

Four hundred and thirty-nine college students (Experiment 1) and 199 adults (Experiment 2) read a series of science claims and indicated their attitudes towards those claims. Each claim was paired with one of the following: A) a direct attack upon the empirical basis of the science claim B) an ad hominem attack on the scientist who made the claim or C) both. Results indicate that ad hominem attacks may have the same degree of impact as attacks on the empirical basis of the science claims, and that allegations of conflict of interest may be just as influential as allegations of outright fraud."
https://openalex.org/W2791546057,"Background MicroRNAs are important mediators of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression through RNA degradation and translational repression, and are emerging biomarkers of immune system activation/response after vaccination. Methods We performed Next Generation Sequencing (mRNA-Seq) of intracellular miRNAs in measles virus-stimulated B and CD4+ T cells from high and low antibody responders to measles vaccine. Negative binomial generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used for miRNA assessment and the DIANA tool was used for gene/target prediction and pathway enrichment analysis. Results We identified a set of B cell-specific miRNAs (e.g., miR-151a-5p, miR-223, miR-29, miR-15a-5p, miR-199a-3p, miR-103a, and miR-15a/16 cluster) and biological processes/pathways, including regulation of adherens junction proteins, Fc-receptor signaling pathway, phosphatidylinositol-mediated signaling pathway, growth factor signaling pathway/pathways, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis and virus-related processes, significantly associated with neutralizing antibody titers after measles vaccination. No CD4+ T cell-specific miRNA expression differences between high and low antibody responders were found. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that miRNA expression directly or indirectly influences humoral immunity to measles vaccination and suggests that B cell-specific miRNAs may serve as useful predictive biomarkers of vaccine humoral immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2790465384,"Introduction Viral load (VL) assessment is the preferred method for diagnosing and confirming virologic failure for patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study to evaluate the virologic suppression rate among patients on ART for ≥6 months in five hospitals around Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Methods Plasma VL was measured and patients with VL <1,000 copies/mL were defined as virologically suppressed. A second VL test was performed within at least six months of the first test. Factors associated with virologic suppression were analyzed using logistic regression models accounting for site-level clustering using complex survey procedures. Results Data were analyzed for 2,313 patients on ART for six months or longer between July 2013 and February 2015. Among them, 1,563 (67.6%) achieved virologic suppression at the first VL test. A second VL test was performed within at least six months for 718 (31.0%) of the patients. Of the 459 patients with an initial HIV-1 RNA <1,000 copies/mL who had a second VL performed, 394 (85.8%) maintained virologic suppression. Virologic suppression was negatively associated with male gender (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.74–0.0.86), 23 to 35 months on ART (aOR:0.72[0.54–0.96]), baseline CD4 counts of 201–500 cells/mm3 and 200 cells/mm3 or lower (aORs: 0.77 [0.62–0.95] and 0.80 [0.66–0.98], respectively), poor adherence (aOR: 0.69 [0.59–0.81]), and TB co-infection (aOR: 0.73 [0.55–0.97]). Conclusions This study showed that over two-thirds of the patients in this evaluation achieved virologic suppression after ≥ six months on ART and the majority of them remained suppressed. These results reinforce the importance of expanding access to HIV-1 viral load testing in Haiti for monitoring ART outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2793749524,"The impacts of global climate change have been a worldwide concern for several research areas, including those dealing with resources essential to human well being, such as agriculture, which directly impact economic activities and food security. Here we evaluate the relative effect of climate (as indicated by the Ecological Niche Model—ENM) and agricultural technology on actual soybean productivity in Brazilian municipalities and estimate the future geographic distribution of soybeans using a novel statistical approach allowing the evaluation of partial coefficients in a non-stationary (Geographically Weighted Regression; GWR) model. We found that technology was more important than climate in explaining soybean productivity in Brazil. However, some municipalities are more dependent on environmental suitability (mainly in Southern Brazil). The future environmental suitability for soybean cultivation tends to decrease by up 50% in the central region of Brazil. Meanwhile, southern-most Brazil will have more favourable conditions, with an increase of ca. 25% in environmental suitability. Considering that opening new areas for cultivation can degrade environmental quality, we suggest that, in the face of climate change impacts on soybean cultivation, the Brazilian government and producers must invest in breeding programmes and more general ecosystem-based strategies for adaptation to climate change, including the development of varieties tolerant to climate stress, and strategies to increase productivity and reduce costs (social and environmental)."

In this study, we quantified physiological stress non-invasively using faecal glucocorticoid metabolites-FGMs analysis and body temperature measurements of 15 superovulated donor merino ewes (Ovis aries) during participation in artificial insemination (AI) program conducted during 2015/2016 Australian summer. We hypothesized that low percentage transferable embryos in donor merino ewes will be associated positively with higher body temperature and/or higher FGMs in these ewes. Temperature humidity index (THI) was calculated and found within high thermal stress range during the two AI trials. Overall, results showed none of the factors (ewe ID, AI trial no., THI or FGMs) were significant for reduced percentage transferrable embryos, except ewe body temperature was highly significant (p = 0.014). Within AI trial comparisons showed significant positive associations between higher FGMs and body temperature with reduced transferrable embryos. These results suggest that Australian merino ewes participating in summer AI trials can experience physiological stress. Prolonged activation of the stress endocrine response and high body temperature (e.g. ensued from heat stress) could impact on ewe reproductive output. Therefore, future research should apply minimally invasive physiological tools to gather baseline information on physiological stress in merino sheep to enable the development of new farm-friendly methods of managing stress."

However, the specific athlete behaviors associated with different PYD profiles are not well understood. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between athletes' observed behavior during sport competitions and their perceptions of PYD outcomes.Cross-sectional study with systematic behavioral observation.Sixty-seven youth athletes were observed during basketball games near the end of their season, and the content of their behavior was systematically coded. Athletes also completed measures of the 4 Cs (competence, confidence connection, and character). A person-centered analysis approach was used to examine the relationship between PYD profiles and observed behavior.A cluster analysis identified two homogenous groups of athletes characterized by relatively high and low perceptions of confidence, connection, and character. A MANCOVA revealed that after controlling for gender and years of playing experience, the high Cs group engaged in more frequent sport communication with their coaches.Results re-affirm the critical role that coaches play in the developmental experiences of young athletes, and highlight the importance of contextual factors of the youth sport environment."
https://openalex.org/W2787701751,"Marine reserves are implemented to achieve a variety of objectives, but are seldom rigorously evaluated to determine whether those objectives are met. In the rare cases when evaluations do take place, they typically focus on ecological indicators and ignore other relevant objectives such as socioeconomics and governance. And regardless of the objectives, the diversity of locations, monitoring protocols, and analysis approaches hinder the ability to compare results across case studies. Moreover, analysis and evaluation of reserves is generally conducted by outside researchers, not the reserve managers or users, plausibly thereby hindering effective local management and rapid response to change. We present a framework and tool, called ""MAREA"", to overcome these challenges. Its purpose is to evaluate the extent to which any given reserve has achieved its stated objectives. MAREA provides specific guidance on data collection and formatting, and then conducts rigorous causal inference analysis based on data input by the user, providing real-time outputs about the effectiveness of the reserve. MAREA's ease of use, standardization of state-of-the-art inference methods, and ability to analyze marine reserve effectiveness across ecological, socioeconomic, and governance objectives could dramatically further our understanding and support of effective marine reserve management."
https://openalex.org/W2790534374,"Amyloids are protein fibrils with a characteristic spatial structure. Amyloids were long perceived as the pathogens involved in a set of lethal diseases in humans and animals. In recent decades, it has become clear that amyloids represent a quaternary protein structure that is not only pathological but also functionally important and is widely used by different organisms, ranging from archaea to animals, to implement diverse biological functions. The greatest biological variety of amyloids is found in prokaryotes, where they control the formation of biofilms and cell wall sheaths, facilitate the overcoming of surface tension, and regulate the metabolism of toxins. Several amyloid proteins were identified in the important model, biotechnological and pathogenic bacterium Escherichia coli. In previous studies, using a method for the proteomic screening and identification of amyloids, we identified 61 potentially amyloidogenic proteins in the proteome of E. coli. Among these proteins, YghJ was the most enriched with bioinformatically predicted amyloidogenic regions. YghJ is a lipoprotein with a zinc metalloprotease M60-like domain that is involved in mucin degradation in the intestine as well as in proinflammatory responses. In this study, we analyzed the amyloid properties of the YghJ M60-like domain and demonstrated that it forms amyloid-like fibrils in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2791657660,"Objectives We investigated the short-term impact of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest typhoons ever to make landfall, on the pattern of admissions in two hospitals in Eastern Visayas, the Philippines. Methods This study took place at Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center (EVRMC) in Tacloban, and Ormoc District Hospital (ODH) in Ormoc. We determined whether there were differences in the pattern of admissions between the week before and the three weeks after Haiyan by using information on sex, age, diagnosis, ward and outcome at discharge from patient records. Results There was a drop in admissions in both hospitals after Haiyan as compared to before. Admissions climbed back to the baseline after ten days in EVRMC and after two weeks in ODH. When comparing the period after Haiyan to the period before, there was a relative increase in male versus female admissions in ODH (OR 2.8, 95%CI 1.7–4.3), but not in EVRMC. Patients aged ≥50 years and 0–14 years had the highest relative increase in admissions. There was a relative decrease in admissions for the ICD10 group ‘Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium’ (OR 0.4, 95%CI 0.3–0.6), and an increase in ‘Certain infectious and parasitic diseases’ (OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.2–3.5), mainly gastroenteritis, and ‘Diseases of the respiratory system’ (OR 1.8, 95%CI 1.0–3.0), mainly pneumonia, compared to all other diagnosis groups in ODH. Out of all reasons for admission within the study period, 66% belong to these three ICD-10 groups. Data on reasons for admission were not available for EVRMC. Conclusions The observed reduction in patients after the Typhoon calls for ensuring that hospital accessibility should be protected and reinforced, especially for pregnant women, by trying to remove debris in the direct hospital vicinity. Hospitals in areas prone to tropical cyclones should be prepared to treat large numbers of patients with gastroenteritis and pneumonia, as part of their disaster plans."
https://openalex.org/W2793982997,"It is well known that the rRNA structure information is important to assist phylogenetic analysis through identifying homologous positions to improve alignment accuracy. In addition, the secondary structure of some conserved motifs is highly stable among distantly related taxa, which can provide potentially informative characters for estimating phylogeny. In this paper, we applied the high-throughput pooled sequencing approach to the determination of neuropteran mitogenomes. Four complete mitogenome sequences were obtained: Micromus angulatus (Hemerobiidae), Chrysoperla nipponensis (Chrysopidae), Rapisma sp. (Ithonidae), and Thaumatosmylus sp. (Osmylidae). This allowed us to sample more complete mitochondrial RNA gene sequences. Secondary structure diagrams for the complete mitochondrial small and large ribosomal subunit RNA genes of eleven neuropterid species were predicted. Comparative analysis of the secondary structures indicated a closer relationship of Megaloptera and Neuroptera. This result was congruent with the resulting phylogeny inferred from sequence alignments of all 37 mitochondrial genes, namely the hypothesis of (Raphidioptera + (Megaloptera + Neuroptera))."
https://openalex.org/W2788250831,"In acute ischemic stroke the status of collateral circulation is a critical factor in determining outcome. We propose a less invasive alternative to digital subtraction angiography for evaluating collaterals based on dynamic-susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging.Perfusion maps of Tmax and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were created for 35 patients with baseline occlusion of a major cerebral artery. Volumes of hypoperfusion were defined as having a Tmax delay of > 4 seconds (Tmax4s) and > 6 seconds (Tmax6s) and a CBF drop below 80% of healthy, contralateral tissue. For each patient a ratio between the volume of the CBF and the Tmax based perfusion deficit was calculated. Associations with collateral status and radiological outcome were assessed with the Mann-Whitney-U test, uni- and multivariable logistic regression analyses as well as area under the receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC) curve.The CBF/Tmax volume ratios were significantly associated with bad collateral status in crude logistic regression analysis as well as with adjustment for NIHSS at admission and baseline infarct volume (OR = 2.5 95% CI[1.2-5.4] p = 0.020 for CBF/Tmax 4s volume ratio and OR = 1.6 95% CI[1.0-2.6] p = 0.031 for CBF/Tmax6s volume ratio). Moreover, the ratios were significantly correlated to final infarct size (Spearman's rho = 0.711 and 0.619, respectively for the CBF/Tmax4s volume ratio and CBF/Tmax6s volume ration, all p<0.001). The ratios also had a high area under the ROC curve of 0.93 95%CI[0.86-1.00]) and 0.90 95%CI[0.80-1.00]respectively for predicting poor radiological outcome.In the setting of acute ischemic stroke the CBF/Tmax volume ratio can be used to differentiate between good and insufficient collateral circulation without the need for invasive procedures like conventional angiography."
https://openalex.org/W2793551306,"Hot spring associated phototrophic microbial mats are purely microbial communities, in which phototrophic bacteria function as primary producers and thus shape the community. The microbial mats at Nakabusa hot springs in Japan harbor diverse photosynthetic bacteria, mainly Thermosynechococcus, Chloroflexus, and Roseiflexus, which use light of different wavelength for energy conversion. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the phototrophs on biodiversity and community composition in hot spring microbial mats. For this, we specifically activated the different phototrophs by irradiating the mats with different wavelengths in situ. We used 625, 730, and 890 nm wavelength LEDs alone or in combination and confirmed the hypothesized increase in relative abundance of different phototrophs by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In addition to the increase of the targeted phototrophs, we studied the effect of the different treatments on chemotrophic members. The specific activation of Thermosynechococcus led to increased abundance of several other bacteria, whereas wavelengths specific to Chloroflexus and Roseiflexus induced a decrease in >50% of the community members as compared to the dark conditions. This suggests that the growth of Thermosynechococcus at the surface layer benefits many community members, whereas less benefit is obtained from an increase in filamentous anoxygenic phototrophs Chloroflexus and Roseiflexus. The increases in relative abundance of chemotrophs under different light conditions suggest a relationship between the two groups. Aerobic chemoheterotrophs such as Thermus sp. and Meiothermus sp. are thought to benefit from aerobic conditions and organic carbon in the form of photosynthates by Thermosynechococcus, while the oxidation of sulfide and production of elemental sulfur by filamentous anoxygenic phototrophs benefit the sulfur-disproportionating Caldimicrobium thiodismutans. In this study, we used an experimental approach under controlled environmental conditions for the analysis of natural microbial communities, which proved to be a powerful tool to study interspecies relationships in the microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W2786444231,"Succinate is a precursor of multiple commodity chemicals and bio-based succinate production is an active area of industrial bioengineering research. One of the most important microbial strains for bio-based production of succinate is the capnophilic gram-negative bacterium Actinobacillus succinogenes, which naturally produces succinate by a mixed-acid fermentative pathway. To engineer A. succinogenes to improve succinate yields during mixed acid fermentation, it is important to have a detailed understanding of the metabolic flux distribution in A. succinogenes when grown in suitable media. To this end, we have developed a detailed stoichiometric model of the A. succinogenes central metabolism that includes the biosynthetic pathways for the main components of biomass-namely glycogen, amino acids, DNA, RNA, lipids and UDP-N-Acetyl-α-D-glucosamine. We have validated our model by comparing model predictions generated via flux balance analysis with experimental results on mixed acid fermentation. Moreover, we have used the model to predict single and double reaction knockouts to maximize succinate production while maintaining growth viability. According to our model, succinate production can be maximized by knocking out either of the reactions catalyzed by the PTA (phosphate acetyltransferase) and ACK (acetyl kinase) enzymes, whereas the double knockouts of PEPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) and PTA or PEPCK and ACK enzymes are the most effective in increasing succinate production."
https://openalex.org/W2788610058,"Background and aims In the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden), the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is relatively low in the general population, but is much higher among people who inject drugs (PWID). We conducted an exploratory study to investigate the extent to which these countries have policies supporting key elements of the public health response that is necessary to achieve the global goal of eliminating HCV as a public health threat. Methods Fourteen stakeholders representing government agencies, medical societies, and civil society organisations (CSOs) in the Nordic countries completed a cross-sectional online survey that included 21 policy questions related to national coordination, prevention, testing, linkage to care, and treatment. We summarised the findings in a descriptive analysis, and noted discrepant responses from stakeholders within the same country. Results Stakeholders reported that three of the five study countries have national viral hepatitis strategies, while only Iceland has a national HCV elimination goal. The availability of harm reduction services varies, with opioid substitution therapy provided for the general population throughout all countries, but not needle and syringe programmes. No country has access to anonymous HCV testing in all parts of the country. National HCV treatment guidelines are available in all countries except Finland, and all countries provide publicly funded direct-acting antiviral treatment. Disagreement regarding policies was observed across countries, and CSOs were the stakeholder group that most frequently answered survey questions incorrectly. Conclusion The Nordic region as a whole has not consistently expressed its commitment to tackling HCV, despite the existence of large HCV epidemics among PWID in these countries. Stakeholder alignment and an established elimination goal with an accompanying strategy and implementation plan should be recognised as the basis for coordinated national public health efforts to achieve HCV elimination in the Nordic region and elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2793503352,"Background Hypertension is the strongest modifiable risk factor for subcortical ischemic changes and is also a risk factor for Alzheimer's dementia. We used neuroimaging to investigate the pathological basis of early cognitive symptoms in patients with hypertension. Methods In this cross-sectional cohort study 67 patients age >60 years with hypertension and Clinical Dementia Rating scale score of 0.5 without dementia, and without history of symptomatic stroke, underwent MRI for measurement of subcortical vascular changes and positron emission tomography (PET) scan with Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB-PET) to detect beta-amyloid deposition. These imaging measures were related to neuropsychological tests of memory, executive function and processing speed. Results Mean age was 75.0 (standard deviation, SD, 7.3). Mean neuropsychological Z scores were: episodic memory -0.63 (SD 1.23), executive function -0.40 (SD 1.10), processing speed -0.24 (SD 0.88); 22 of the 67 subjects met criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the remaining 45 subjects had subjective cognitive concerns only. In multivariable models adjusting for age and years of education, each 0.1 unit increase in mean cortical PiB-PET binding was associated with 0.14 lower mean Z score for episodic memory (95% CI -0.28 to -0.01). This means that for every 0.1 unit increase in mean cortical PiB-PET, episodic memory was 0.14 standard deviations lower. White matter hyperintensity volume, silent brain infarcts and microbleeds were not associated with neuropsychological test scores. Conclusions Episodic memory was prominently affected in hypertensive participants with MCI or subjective cognitive concerns, and was associated with PiB-PET binding. This suggests a prominent role for Alzheimer pathology in cognitive impairment even in hypertensive participants at elevated risk for vascular cognitive impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2793512225,"Complex networks are a useful tool for the understanding of complex systems. One of the emerging properties of such systems is their tendency to form hierarchies: networks can be organized in levels, with nodes in each level exerting control on the ones beneath them. In this paper, we focus on the problem of estimating how hierarchical a directed network is. We propose a structural argument: a network has a strong top-down organization if we need to delete only few edges to reduce it to a perfect hierarchy-an arborescence. In an arborescence, all edges point away from the root and there are no horizontal connections, both characteristics we desire in our idealization of what a perfect hierarchy requires. We test our arborescence score in synthetic and real-world directed networks against the current state of the art in hierarchy detection: agony, flow hierarchy and global reaching centrality. These tests highlight that our arborescence score is intuitive and we can visualize it; it is able to better distinguish between networks with and without a hierarchical structure; it agrees the most with the literature about the hierarchy of well-studied complex systems; and it is not just a score, but it provides an overall scheme of the underlying hierarchy of any directed complex network."

The northern Mexican gartersnake (Thamnophis eques megalops) was listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 2014. Natural resource managers are interested in understanding the ecology of this subspecies to guide management decisions and to determine what features are necessary for habitat creation and restoration. Our objective was to identify habitat selection of northern Mexican gartersnakes in a highly managed, constructed wetland hatchery. We deployed transmitters on 42 individual gartersnakes and documented use of habitat types and selection of specific habitat features. Habitat selection was similar between males and females and varied seasonally. During the active season (March–October), gartersnakes primarily selected wetland edge habitat with abundant cover. Gestating females selected similar locations but with less dense cover. During the inactive season (November–February), gartersnakes selected upland habitats, including rocky slopes with abundant vegetation. These results of this study can help inform management of the subspecies, particularly in human-influenced habitats. Conservation of this subspecies should incorporate a landscape-level approach that includes abundant wetland edge habitat with a mosaic of dense cover for protection and sparsely vegetated areas for basking connected to terrestrial uplands for overwintering."
https://openalex.org/W2792858927,"Reducing neonatal and child mortality is a key component of the health-related sustainable development goal (SDG), but most low and middle income countries lack data to monitor child mortality on an annual basis. We tested a mortality monitoring system based on the continuous recording of pregnancies, births and deaths by trained community-based volunteers (CBV).This project was implemented in 96 clusters located in three districts of the Northern Region of Ghana. Community-based volunteers (CBVs) were selected from these clusters and were trained in recording all pregnancies, births, and deaths among children under 5 in their catchment areas. Data collection lasted from January 2012 through September 2013. All CBVs transmitted tallies of recorded births and deaths to the Ghana Birth and deaths registry each month, except in one of the study districts (approximately 80% reporting). Some events were reported only several months after they had occurred. We assessed the completeness and accuracy of CBV data by comparing them to retrospective full pregnancy histories (FPH) collected during a census of the same clusters conducted in October-December 2013. We conducted all analyses separately by district, as well as for the combined sample of all districts. During the 21-month implementation period, the CBVs reported a total of 2,819 births and 137 under-five deaths. Among the latter, there were 84 infant deaths (55 neonatal deaths and 29 post-neonatal deaths). Comparison of the CBV data with FPH data suggested that CBVs significantly under-estimated child mortality: the estimated under-5 mortality rate according to CBV data was only 2/3 of the rate estimated from FPH data (95% Confidence Interval for the ratio of the two rates = 51.7 to 81.4). The discrepancies between the CBV and FPH estimates of infant and neonatal mortality were more limited, but varied significantly across districts.In northern Ghana, a community-based data collection systems relying on volunteers did not yield accurate estimates of child mortality rates. Additional implementation research is needed to improve the timeliness, completeness and accuracy of such systems. Enhancing pregnancy monitoring, in particular, may be an essential step to improve the measurement of neonatal mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2793241027,"The initiation of protein synthesis requires the involvement of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4G to promote assembly of the factors needed to recruit a 40S ribosomal subunit to an mRNA. Although many eukaryotes express two eIF4G isoforms that are highly similar, those in plants, referred to as eIF4G and eIFiso4G, are highly divergent in size, sequence, and domain organization. Species of the Brassicaceae and the Cleomaceae also express a divergent eIFiso4G isoform, referred to as eIFiso4G2, not found elsewhere in the plant kingdom. Despite their divergence, eIF4G and eIFiso4G interact with eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4E isoforms needed for binding an mRNA. eIF4G and eIFiso4G also interact with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) which promotes ribosome recruitment to an mRNA. Increasing the complexity of such an interaction, however, Arabidopsis also expresses three PABP isoforms (PAB2, PAB4, and PAB8) in vegetative and reproductive tissues. In this study, the functional interactions among the eIF4G and the widely-expressed PABP isoforms were examined. Loss of PAB2 or PAB8 in combination with loss of eIF4G or eIFiso4G had little to no effect on growth or fertility whereas pab2 pab8 eif4g or pab2 pab8 eifiso4g1/2 mutants exhibited smaller stature and reduced fertility. Although the pab4 eifiso4g1 mutant grows normally and is fertile, pab4 eif4g or pab4 eifiso4g2 mutants could not be isolated. Even pab4/PAB4 eif4g/eIF4G heterozygous plants exhibited growth defects and low fertility. Mutant co-inheritance analysis in reciprocal crosses with wild-type plants revealed that most ovaries and pollen from pab4/PAB4 eif4g/eIF4G plants were PAB4 eif4g. Similarly, co-inheritance studies with pab4/PAB4 eifiso4g2/eIFiso4G2 plants suggested most ovaries were PAB4 eifiso4g2. These results suggest that a functional interaction between PAB4 and eIF4G and between PAB4 and eIFiso4G2 is required for growth and normal fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2788392067,"We hypothesized that bmo-miR-275 has a potential regulatory function regarding the expression of sericin gene 2 (BmSer-2). First, we examined the expression of bmo-miR-275 and its target gene BmSer-2 in seven different tissues from 5th instar day-3 silkworm larvae. The results showed that they were both specifically expressed in the middle silk gland, implying that spatio-temporal conditions are required for bmo-miR-275 to regulate the expression of BmSer-2. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a pri-bmo-miR-275 expressing plasmid pcDNA3.0 [ie1-egfp-pri-bmo-miR-275-SV40] and BmSer-2-3´UTR recombinant reporter plasmids pGL3.0 [A3-luc-Ser-2-3′ UTR-SV40]. Finally, BmN cells were harvested and luciferase activity was detected. Results showed that luciferase activity was reduced significantly (P<0.05) in BmN cells co-transfected with pcDNA3.0 [ie1-egfp-pri-bmo-miR-275-SV40] and pGL3.0 [A3-luc-Ser-2-3’UTR-SV40], suggesting that bmo-miR-275 can down-regulate the expression of BmSer-2 in vitro.

The results can provide quantitative or semiquantitative pathology-related parameters, thus giving DMRI great potential for clinical applications. However, conventional DMRI techniques suffer from low temporal resolution and long scan time owing to the limitations of the k-space sampling scheme and image reconstruction algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel DMRI sampling scheme based on a golden-ratio Cartesian trajectory in combination with a compressed sensing reconstruction algorithm. The results of two simulation experiments, designed according to the two major DMRI techniques, showed that the proposed method can improve the temporal resolution and shorten the scan time and provide high-quality reconstructed images."
https://openalex.org/W2793930707,"Alternative splicing is a popular phenomenon in different types of plants. It can produce alternative spliced transcripts that encode proteins with altered functions. Previous studies have shown that one transcription factor, ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3), which encodes an important component in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, is subjected to alternative splicing in both mono- and dicotyledons. In the current study, we identified two homologs of ABI3 in the genome of linseed flax. We screened two alternatively spliced flax LuABI3 transcripts, LuABI3-2 and LuABI3-3, and one normal flax LuABI3 transcript, LuABI3-1. Sequence analysis revealed that one of the alternatively spliced transcripts, LuABI3-3, retained a 6 bp intron. RNA accumulation analysis showed that all three transcripts were expressed during seed development, while subcellular localization and transgene experiments showed that LuABI3-3 had no biological function. The two normal transcripts, LuABI3-1 and LuABI3-2, are the important functional isoforms in flax and play significant roles in the ABA regulatory pathway during seed development, germination, and maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2789646963,"The ability to discriminate between normal and impaired dynamic cerebral autoregulation (CA), based on measurements of spontaneous fluctuations in arterial blood pressure (BP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF), has considerable clinical relevance. We studied 45 normal subjects at rest and under hypercapnia induced by breathing a mixture of carbon dioxide and air. Non-linear models with BP as input and CBF velocity (CBFV) as output, were implemented with support vector machines (SVM) using separate recordings for learning and validation. Dynamic SVM implementations used either moving average or autoregressive structures. The efficiency of dynamic CA was estimated from the model’s derived CBFV response to a step change in BP as an autoregulation index for both linear and non-linear models. Non-linear models with recurrences (autoregressive) showed the best results, with CA indexes of 5.9 ± 1.5 in normocapnia, and 2.5 ± 1.2 for hypercapnia with an area under the receiver-operator curve of 0.955. The high performance achieved by non-linear SVM models to detect deterioration of dynamic CA should encourage further assessment of its applicability to clinical conditions where CA might be impaired."
https://openalex.org/W2789954931,"Hawaii has experienced a catastrophic decline in frugivorous native birds coupled with the introduction of non-native species. Puaiohi (Myadestes palmeri), a critically endangered thrush, is the sole extant native songbird capable of dispersing fleshy fruited plants in the rainforest of Kauai island, Hawaii. As this species has declined to occupy a small proportion of its original range, a suite of largely omnivorous non-native birds have been introduced to this region, including the common and widespread Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus). This reshuffling of the bird community could have long-term implications for plant community composition if introduced birds incompletely replace the ecological role of native species. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential consequences of the local extirpation of Puaiohi for seed dispersal. Specifically, we compared the diet of Puaiohi and Japanese White-eye, vegetation characteristics, and seed rain at sites with and without Puaiohi in the Na Pali-Kona Forest Reserve on the island of Kauai. We found high overlap in the composition of seeds consumed by the two bird species, but differences in the characteristics of seeds consumed; Japanese White-eye appeared more likely to consume smaller seeded species compared with Puaiohi. Sites with Puaiohi received substantially higher seed rain during the study period, despite no significant differences in overall fruit abundance. Our results suggest that non-native birds are unlikely to completely replace the seed dispersal services provided by Puaiohi. If Puaohi continue to be rare and range restricted, we predict a shift in plant community composition through an increase in non-native and small-seeded plants, and possible dispersal failure of other native species. Our findings lend further support to efforts to conserve Puaiohi across its current and former range, and to consider introductions to other suitable areas to ensure the persistence not only of the species and but also its functional role in Hawaii’s montane ecosystems."

The relationship between hTG and acute pancreatitis, however, may not support this approach to clinical management. This study analyzed administrative data from the Veterans Health Administration for evidence of (1) temporal association between assessed triglycerides level and days to acute pancreatitis admission; (2) association between hTG and outcomes in the year after hospitalization for acute pancreatitis; (3) relative rates of prescription of fibrates vs statins in patients with acute pancreatitis; (4) association of prescription of fibrates alone versus fibrates with statins or statins alone with rates of adverse outcomes after hospitalization for acute pancreatitis. Only modest association was found between above-normal or extremely high triglycerides and time until acute pancreatitis. CHD/MI/stroke occurred in 23% in the year following AP, supporting cardiovascular risk management. Fibrates were prescribed less often than statins, defying conventional wisdom, but the high rates of cardiovascular events in the year following AP support a clinical focus on reducing cardiovascular risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2794071571,"Every day, we engage in social interactions with other people which require understanding their as well as our own mental states. Such capacity is commonly referred to as Theory of Mind (ToM). Disturbances of ToM are often reported in diverse pathologies which affect brain functioning and lead to problems in social interactions. Identifying ToM deficits is thus crucial to guide the clinicians in the establishment of adequate rehabilitation strategies for patients. Previous studies have demonstrated that ToM is not a unitary function yet currently there are very few standardized tests which allow identifying the type of cognitive processes affected when a patient exhibits a ToM deficit. In the current study, we present two belief reasoning tasks which have been used in previous research to disentangle two types of processes involved in belief reasoning: self-perspective inhibition and the spontaneous inference of another person's belief. A three-step procedure was developed to provide clinicians with the tools to interpret the patients' performances on the tasks. First, these tasks were standardized and normative data was collected on a sample of 124 healthy participants aged between 18 and 74. Data collected showed a decrease in performance as a function of age only in the task that loaded most in spontaneous other-perspective demands. There was however no effect of gender or educational level. Cut-off scores to identify deficits were then calculated for the different age groups separately. Secondly, the three-step procedure was applied to 21 brain-damaged patients and showed a large diversity of profiles, including selective deficits of the two targeted ToM processes. The diversity of profiles shows the importance to take into account the multiple facets of ToM during the diagnosis and rehabilitation of patients with suspected ToM deficits."

Between European countries, transfusion practice of red blood cells (RBC) greatly differs. Only sparse data are available on transfusion practice of general internal medicine physicians in Switzerland.In this cross-sectional survey, physicians working in general medicine teaching hospitals in Switzerland were investigated regarding their self-reported transfusion practice in anemic patients without acute bleeding. The definition of anemia, transfusion triggers, knowledge on RBC transfusion, and implementation of guidelines were assessed.560 physicians of 71 hospitals (64%) responded to the survey. Anemia was defined at very diverging hemoglobin values (by 38% at a hemoglobin <130 g/L for men and by 57% at <120 g/L in non-pregnant women). 62% and 43% respectively, did not define anemia in men and in women according to the World Health Organization.

Following factors were indicated to influence the decision to transfuse: educational background of the physicians, geographical region of employment, severity of anemia, and presence of known coronary artery disease. 60% indicated that their knowledge on Transfusion-related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) did not influence transfusion practice. 50% of physicians stated that no local transfusion guidelines exist and 84% supported the development of national recommendations on transfusion in non-acutely bleeding, anemic patients.This study highlights the lack of adherence to current transfusion guidelines in Switzerland. Identifying and subsequently correcting this deficit in knowledge translation may have a significant impact on patient care."
https://openalex.org/W2786746467,"We investigated how various grouping factors altered subjective disappearances of the individual targets in the motion-induced blindness display. The latter relies on a moving mask to render highly salient static targets temporarily subjectively invisible. Specifically, we employed two extrinsic grouping factors, the connectedness and the common region, and examined whether their presence would make targets more resilient against the suppression. In addition, we investigated whether the presence of an illusory Kanizsa triangle would affect the suppression of the inducing Pac-Man elements. We quantified the perceptual dynamics using the proportion of the disappearance time (this indicates whether targets became more resilient against the suppression), and the proportion of simultaneous disappearance and reappearance events (characterizes the tendency for the targets to disappear or reappear as a group). We report that a single mask that encompassed all targets (a common region grouping) significantly increased the proportion of simultaneous disappearance and reappearance events, but had no effect on the proportion of the disappearance time. In contrast, a line that connected two targets significantly decreased the total invisibility time, but had no impact on the simultaneity of the disappearance and reappearance events. We found no statistically significant effect of the presence of the illusory Kanizsa triangle on either measure. Finally, we found no interaction either between the common region and the connectedness or between the common region and the presence of the illusory Kanizsa triangle. Our results indicate that extrinsic grouping factors might influence the perception differently than the intrinsic ones and highlight the importance of using several measures to characterize the perceptual dynamics, as various grouping factors might affect it differentially."
https://openalex.org/W2792597781,"Field studies to detect environmental DNA (eDNA) can be undertaken to infer the presence of a rare or cryptic species in a water body. These studies are implemented by collecting water samples from the water body, processing those samples to isolate genetic material contained in the water sample, and using a laboratory assay to find a species-specific genetic marker within a sample of the genetic material. To date, conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been one of the most widely used assays in field studies to detect eDNA. This assay is strictly a test for the presence of the genetic marker. It provides no estimate of the concentration of the target genetic marker in the sample or in the environment. Understanding the concentration of a target marker in the environment is a critical first step toward using the results of eDNA field surveys to support inferences about the location and strength of eDNA sources. In this study, the results of eDNA field surveys are combined with a model of the sensitivity of the field survey methods to estimate target marker concentrations using Bayesian updating. The method is demonstrated for Asian carp in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) using the results of field surveys for eDNA carried out during the period 2009 through 2012, a four-year period during which more than 5,800 two-liter water samples were collected and analyzed using PCR. Concentrations of bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) eDNA are estimated for twenty hydrologic reaches of the CAWS. This study also assesses the sensitivity of these concentration estimates to evidentiary criteria that limit what evidence is used in Bayesian updating based on requirements for sampling intensity and frequency."
https://openalex.org/W2793989368,"Salmonid farming in Ireland is mostly organic, which implies limited disease treatment options. This highlights the importance of biosecurity for preventing the introduction and spread of infectious agents. Similarly, the effect of local network properties on infection spread processes has rarely been evaluated. In this paper, we characterized the biosecurity of salmonid farms in Ireland using a survey, and then developed a score for benchmarking the disease risk of salmonid farms. The usefulness and validity of this score, together with farm indegree (dichotomized as ≤ 1 or > 1), were assessed through generalized Poisson regression models, in which the modeled outcome was pathogen richness, defined here as the number of different diseases affecting a farm during a year. Seawater salmon (SW salmon) farms had the highest biosecurity scores with a median (interquartile range) of 82.3 (5.4), followed by freshwater salmon (FW salmon) with 75.2 (8.2), and freshwater trout (FW trout) farms with 74.8 (4.5). For FW salmon and trout farms, the top ranked model (in terms of leave-one-out information criteria, looic) was the null model (looic = 46.1). For SW salmon farms, the best ranking model was the full model with both predictors and their interaction (looic = 33.3). Farms with a higher biosecurity score were associated with lower pathogen richness, and farms with indegree > 1 (i.e. more than one fish supplier) were associated with increased pathogen richness. The effect of the interaction between these variables was also important, showing an antagonistic effect. This would indicate that biosecurity effectiveness is achieved through a broader perspective on the subject, which includes a minimization in the number of suppliers and hence in the possibilities for infection to enter a farm. The work presented here could be used to elaborate indicators of a farm’s disease risk based on its biosecurity score and indegree, to inform risk-based disease surveillance and control strategies for private and public stakeholders."
https://openalex.org/W2794157902,"Introduction Lymphoid tissue fibrosis may contribute to incomplete immune reconstitution on antiretroviral therapy (ART) via local CD4+ T lymphocyte (CD4) depletion. Hyaluronic acid (HA) increases with fibrotic burden. CXCL4 concentrations increase in response to pro-fibrotic stimuli, but lower CXCL4 concentrations in HIV-infected individuals may reflect successful immune evasion by HIV. We investigated relationships between circulating HA and CXCL4 concentrations and immune reconstitution on ART in HIV-infected Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study participants. Methods HIV-infected men on ART for >1 year with cryopreserved plasma samples and suppressed post-ART HIV-1 RNA were included. Men with post-ART CD4 500 cells/mm3 served as controls (n = 49). HA and CXCL4 concentrations were measured via ELISA. Results Median pre-ART CD4 was 297 cells/mm3 for non-responders vs 386 cells/mm3 for controls. Median post-ART CD4 was 141 cells/mm3 for non-responders and 815 cells/mm3 for controls. HIV infection duration was 23 years, with median time on ART 13 years for non-responders vs 11 years for controls. Pre-ART HA and CXCL4 concentrations did not vary by eventual immune reconstitution status. Post-ART HA concentrations tended to be higher (85 vs 36 ng/mL, p = 0.07) and CXCL4 concentrations were lower (563 vs 1459 ng/mL, p = 0.01) among non-responders. Among men with paired pre-/post-ART samples, non-responders had greater HA increases and CXCL4 decreases than controls (HA: 50 vs 12 ng/mL, p = 0.04; CXCL4: -1258 vs -405 ng/mL, p = 0.01). Conclusions Higher circulating concentrations of HA and lower concentrations of CXCL4 are associated with failure of immune reconstitution on ART."
https://openalex.org/W2792914229,"Non-pharmacological therapies, especially the physical maneuvers, are viewed as important and promising strategies for reducing syncope recurrences in vasovagal syncope (VVS) patients. We observed the efficacy of a modified Valsalva maneuver (MVM) in VVS patients. 72 VVS patients with syncope history and positive head-up tilt table testing (HUTT) results were randomly divided into conventional treatment group (NVM group, n = 36) and conventional treatment plus standard MVM for 30 days group (MVM group, n = 36). Incidence of recurrent syncope after 12 months (6.5% vs. 41.2%, P<0.01) and rate of positive HUTT after 30 days (9.7% vs.79.4%, P<0.01) were significantly lower in MVM group than in NVM group. HRV results showed that low frequency (LF), LF/ high frequency (HF), standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN) and standard deviation of all 5-min average NN intervals (SDANN) values were significantly lower in the NVM and MVM groups than in the control group at baseline. After 30 days treatment, LF, LF/HF, SDNN, SDANN values were significantly higher compared to baseline in MVM group. Results of Cox proportional hazard model showed that higher SDNN and SDANN values at 30 days after intervention were protective factors, while positive HUTT at 30 days after intervention was risk factor for recurrent syncope. Our results indicate that 30 days MVM intervention could effectively reduce the incidence of recurrent syncope up to 12 months in VVS patients, possibly through improving sympathetic function of VVS patients."
