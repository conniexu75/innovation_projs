https://openalex.org/W2125789330,"Clinical responses to anticancer therapies are often restricted to a subset of patients. In some cases, mutated cancer genes are potent biomarkers for responses to targeted agents. Here, to uncover new biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to cancer therapeutics, we screened a panel of several hundred cancer cell lines—which represent much of the tissue-type and genetic diversity of human cancers—with 130 drugs under clinical and preclinical investigation. In aggregate, we found that mutated cancer genes were associated with cellular response to most currently available cancer drugs. Classic oncogene addiction paradigms were modified by additional tissue-specific or expression biomarkers, and some frequently mutated genes were associated with sensitivity to a broad range of therapeutic agents. Unexpected relationships were revealed, including the marked sensitivity of Ewing’s sarcoma cells harbouring the EWS (also known as EWSR1)-FLI1 gene translocation to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. By linking drug activity to the functional complexity of cancer genomes, systematic pharmacogenomic profiling in cancer cell lines provides a powerful biomarker discovery platform to guide rational cancer therapeutic strategies. Human cancer cell lines are screened with drugs, undergoing clinical or preclinical investigation, to determine specific genomic alterations associated with response to therapeutic agents. Cancer cell lines are widely used as preclinical models to gain mechanistic and therapeutic insight. Two manuscripts in this issue describe the large-scale genetic and pharmacological characterization of human cancer cell lines. Each group characterized collections of several-hundred cell lines using different platforms and analytical methods. Their results are complementary, and confirm that many human cell lines capture the genomic diversity of their respective cancers. Initial findings include the identification of a number of potential markers of drug sensitivity and resistance. For example, Garnett et al. report an association between EWS-FLI1 gene translocations, frequently found in Ewing's sarcoma, and sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, a class of drug currently in clinical trials for other cancer types. Barretina et al. report a possible association between SLFN11 expression and sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors."

At present, distillation is the primary means of separating the components of this mixture. A sorbent or membrane-based approach to separation could reap substantial energy savings. Bloch et al. (p. 1606 ) found that an iron-based metal organic framework material shows promise for very efficient sorption-based separation of ethane and ethylene, propane and propylene, and several other light hydrocarbon mixtures. Neutron diffraction directly revealed the binding motifs at the iron centers that selectively pinned down the olefins while the saturated hydrocarbons passed by."

These compounds act on the insect central nervous system, and they have been shown to be persistent in the environment and in plant tissues. Recently, there have been controversial connections made between neonicotinoids and pollinator deaths, but the mechanisms underlying these potential deaths have remained unknown. Whitehorn et al. (p. 351 , published online 29 March) exposed developing colonies of bumble bees to low levels of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and then released them to forage under natural conditions. Treated colonies displayed reduced colony growth and less reproductive success, and they produced significantly fewer queens to found subsequent generations. Henry et al. (p. 348 , published online 29 March) documented the effects of low-dose, nonlethal intoxication of another widely used neonicotinoid, thiamethoxam, on wild foraging honey bees. Radio-frequency identification tags were used to determine navigation success of treated foragers, which suggested that their homing success was much reduced relative to untreated foragers."
https://openalex.org/W2157360228,"Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), extends the life spans of yeast, flies, and mice. Calorie restriction, which increases life span and insulin sensitivity, is proposed to function by inhibition of mTORC1, yet paradoxically, chronic administration of rapamycin substantially impairs glucose tolerance and insulin action. We demonstrate that rapamycin disrupted a second mTOR complex, mTORC2, in vivo and that mTORC2 was required for the insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Further, decreased mTORC1 signaling was sufficient to extend life span independently from changes in glucose homeostasis, as female mice heterozygous for both mTOR and mLST8 exhibited decreased mTORC1 activity and extended life span but had normal glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Thus, mTORC2 disruption is an important mediator of the effects of rapamycin in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2011072921,"The circadian clock acts at the genomic level to coordinate internal behavioural and physiological rhythms via the CLOCK-BMAL1 transcriptional heterodimer. Although the nuclear receptors REV-ERB-α and REV-ERB-β have been proposed to form an accessory feedback loop that contributes to clock function, their precise roles and importance remain unresolved. To establish their regulatory potential, we determined the genome-wide cis-acting targets (cistromes) of both REV-ERB isoforms in murine liver, which revealed shared recognition at over 50% of their total DNA binding sites and extensive overlap with the master circadian regulator BMAL1. Although REV-ERB-α has been shown to regulate Bmal1 expression directly, our cistromic analysis reveals a more profound connection between BMAL1 and the REV-ERB-α and REV-ERB-β genomic regulatory circuits than was previously suspected. Genes within the intersection of the BMAL1, REV-ERB-α and REV-ERB-β cistromes are highly enriched for both clock and metabolic functions. As predicted by the cistromic analysis, dual depletion of Rev-erb-α and Rev-erb-β function by creating double-knockout mice profoundly disrupted circadian expression of core circadian clock and lipid homeostatic gene networks. As a result, double-knockout mice show markedly altered circadian wheel-running behaviour and deregulated lipid metabolism. These data now unite REV-ERB-α and REV-ERB-β with PER, CRY and other components of the principal feedback loop that drives circadian expression and indicate a more integral mechanism for the coordination of circadian rhythm and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1990356462,"Synchronizing rhythms of behaviour and metabolic processes is important for cardiovascular health and preventing metabolic diseases. The nuclear receptors REV-ERB-α and REV-ERB-β have an integral role in regulating the expression of core clock proteins driving rhythms in activity and metabolism. Here we describe the identification of potent synthetic REV-ERB agonists with in vivo activity. Administration of synthetic REV-ERB ligands alters circadian behaviour and the circadian pattern of core clock gene expression in the hypothalami of mice. The circadian pattern of expression of an array of metabolic genes in the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue was also altered, resulting in increased energy expenditure. Treatment of diet-induced obese mice with a REV-ERB agonist decreased obesity by reducing fat mass and markedly improving dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia. These results indicate that synthetic REV-ERB ligands that pharmacologically target the circadian rhythm may be beneficial in the treatment of sleep disorders as well as metabolic diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2157681159,"A Better Date Uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating, which is one of the most commonly used methods of radiometric dating for old terrestrial materials, operates by comparing the ratio of trace levels of U with its nuclear decay product Pb. This dating method, and the similar Pb-Pb method, assumes that the ratio between the two most common U isotopes ( 238 U and 235 U) is constant. By accurately measuring the 238 U/ 235 U ratio in a suite of minerals representing a range of tectonic environments, Hiess et al. (p. 1610 ; see the Perspective by Stirling ) demonstrate that this ratio is more variable than was previously thought. The variability does not reflect any systematic bias with time, location, or temperature—suggesting that ideally 238 U/ 235 U should be determined for every sample to calculate ages. In the absence of such data, a revised 238 U/ 235 U ratio for zircon minerals could significantly modify previous age estimates using U-Pb and Pb-Pb dating techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2032355167,"Aggregation of the microtubule associated protein Tau is associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia. In Alzheimer disease, Tau pathology spreads progressively throughout the brain, possibly along existing neural networks. However, it is still unclear how the propagation of Tau misfolding occurs. Intriguingly, in animal models, vaccine-based therapies have reduced Tau and synuclein pathology by uncertain mechanisms, given that these proteins are intracellular. We have previously speculated that trans-cellular propagation of misfolding could be mediated by a process similar to prion pathogenesis, in which fibrillar Tau aggregates spread pathology from cell to cell. However, there has been little evidence to demonstrate true trans-cellular propagation of Tau misfolding, in which Tau aggregates from one cell directly contact Tau protein in the recipient cell to trigger further aggregation. Here we have observed that intracellular Tau fibrils are directly released into the medium and then taken up by co-cultured cells. Internalized Tau aggregates induce fibrillization of intracellular Tau in these naive recipient cells via direct protein-protein contact that we demonstrate using FRET. Tau aggregation can be amplified across several generations of cells. An anti-Tau monoclonal antibody blocks Tau aggregate propagation by trapping fibrils in the extracellular space and preventing their uptake. Thus, propagation of Tau protein misfolding among cells can be mediated by release and subsequent uptake of fibrils that directly contact native protein in recipient cells. These results support the model of aggregate propagation by templated conformational change and suggest a mechanism for vaccine-based therapies in neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2064456932,"Generating Inflammasomes Inflammasomes are large, multiprotein complexes that assemble in response to infection that are also involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of other diseases, including type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. The assembly of the inflammasome triggers an inflammatory cascade that results in the activation of caspase-1 and production of the cytokines interleukin-1 and -18. Very little, however, is known about the specific signals that trigger inflammasome assembly. Shenoy et al. (p. 481, published online 29 March; see the Perspective by Caffrey and Fitzgerald ) now show that guanylate binding protein 5 (GBP5) promotes the assembly of the NLRP3-containing inflammasome in response to certain activation signals, such as pathogenic bacteria and adenosine triphosphate, but not others, like crystalline stimuli. Mice deficient in GBP5 exhibited impaired caspase-1 activation and production of cytokines. NLRP3 inflammasome–dependent responses to pathogenic bacteria and inflammatory stimuli were also impaired in mice lacking GBP5."
https://openalex.org/W2083986366,"By the Numbers As carbon dioxide is exchanged between the atmosphere, the oceans, and the terrestrial biosphere, its carbon isotopic composition is modified by various processes involved in its transfer between the different reservoirs. The carbon isotopic composition of the carbon dioxide contained in bubbles of air trapped in ice cores thus provides a record of the processes that regulated the composition of the atmosphere in the past. Using data from three Antarctic ice cores, Schmitt et al. (p. 711 , published online 29 March; see the Perspective by Brook ) present a record of the carbon isotopic makeup of atmospheric CO 2 for the past 24,000 years. The findings reveal the dominant role of the oceans during the early part of the deglaciation and the effects of the regrowth of the terrestrial biosphere later in the deglacial transition. Before the deglaciation, during the Last Glacial Maximum, the carbon cycle was essentially at equilibrium."

https://openalex.org/W1967580058,"Oncogenic levels of MYC, the deregulation of which is implicated in many human tumours, are shown to establish a dependence on ARK5, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies. Deregulated expression of the MYC oncogene is characteristic of many cancers. In an RNA interference screen designed to uncover genes that are crucial for cell survival specifically in MYC-driven tumour cells, Martin Eilers and colleagues have identified the kinase ARK5 as an important factor in MYC-mediated transformation. This is attributable to metabolic stress in MYC-expressing cells in which ARK5 is shown to be crucial for metabolic homeostasis and hence cell survival. ARK5 is also crucial in a MYC-driven mouse model of liver cancer. As a transcriptional regulator, MYC is difficult to target therapeutically, so ARK5 might prove to be an alternative target. Deregulated expression of the MYC oncoprotein contributes to the genesis of many human tumours, yet strategies to exploit this for a rational tumour therapy are scarce. MYC promotes cell growth and proliferation, and alters cellular metabolism to enhance the provision of precursors for phospholipids and cellular macromolecules1,2. Here we show in human and murine cell lines that oncogenic levels of MYC establish a dependence on AMPK-related kinase 5 (ARK5; also known as NUAK1) for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and for cell survival. ARK5 is an upstream regulator of AMPK and limits protein synthesis via inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC1) signalling pathway. ARK5 also maintains expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and respiratory capacity, which is required for efficient glutamine metabolism. Inhibition of ARK5 leads to a collapse of cellular ATP levels in cells expressing deregulated MYC, inducing multiple pro-apoptotic responses as a secondary consequence. Depletion of ARK5 prolongs survival in MYC-driven mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma, demonstrating that targeting cellular energy homeostasis is a valid therapeutic strategy to eliminate tumour cells that express deregulated MYC."

Laboratory experiments suggest that these organics were inherited from the interstellar medium and predate the existence of the solar system. By using particle-tracking models, Ciesla and Sandford (p. 452, published online 29 March; see the Perspective by Nuth and Johnson ) explored the possibility that the organics could have been produced within the outer reaches of the protoplanetary disk from which the solar system planets originate. Grains within a protoplanetary disk follow irregular paths; such orbital histories subjected model particles to ultraviolet radiation and temperatures that have been shown in laboratory experiments to generate organic compounds."

A fundamen- tal step toward this goal would be to identify the relative weight of the electronic and phononic contributions to the overall frequency (\Omega) dependent bosonic function, \Pi(\Omega). We perform optical spectroscopy on Bi2212 crystals with simultaneous time- and frequency-resolution; this technique allows us to disentangle the electronic and phononic contributions by their different temporal evolution. The strength of the interaction ({\lambda}~1.1) with the electronic excitations and their spectral distribution fully account for the high critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition."
https://openalex.org/W1998370988,"Bacterial microcompartments are organelles composed of a protein shell that surrounds functionally related proteins. Bioinformatic analysis of sequenced genomes indicates that homologs to shell protein genes are widespread among bacteria and suggests that the shell proteins are capable of encapsulating diverse enzymes. The carboxysome is a bacterial microcompartment that enhances CO(2) fixation in cyanobacteria and some chemoautotrophs by sequestering ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and carbonic anhydrase in the microcompartment shell. Here, we report the in vitro and in vivo characterization of CcmN, a protein of previously unknown function that is absolutely conserved in β-carboxysomal gene clusters. We show that CcmN localizes to the carboxysome and is essential for carboxysome biogenesis. CcmN has two functionally distinct regions separated by a poorly conserved linker. The N-terminal portion of the protein is important for interaction with CcmM and, by extension, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and the carbonic anhydrase CcaA, whereas the C-terminal peptide is essential for interaction with the carboxysome shell. Deletion of the peptide abolishes carboxysome formation, indicating that its interaction with the shell is an essential step in microcompartment formation. Peptides with similar length and sequence properties to those in CcmN can be bioinformatically detected in a large number of diverse proteins proposed to be encapsulated in functionally distinct microcompartments, suggesting that this peptide and its interaction with its cognate shell proteins are common features of microcompartment assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1966132457,"Choosing the Right Path RNA molecules are synthesized in the cell nucleus, yet many have to be moved to the cytoplasm to be processed and/or to effect their function. Different classes of RNA are transported from the nucleus by different transport systems. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and uridine-rich small nuclear RNAs (U snRNAs) are transcribed by RNA polymerase II and are capped and bound by the cap-binding machinery in the nucleus but are exported by different protein complexes. The feature that distinguishes the two classes of RNA is their length: U snRNAs are short and mRNAs are long. Using an in vitro system and human tissue culture cells, McCloskey et al. (p. 1643 ) show that the length of the RNAs is measured by the heterogeneous nuclear ribonicleoprotein (hnRNP) C tetrameric protein complex. The hnRNP C cannot bind to the short U snRNAs, allowing the U snRNA-specific export adaptor protein, PHAX, to bind and mediate export. Longer mRNAs are bound by hnRNP C, which prevents the binding of PHAX, thus identifying these RNAs for export from the nucleus via the mRNA pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2032183557,"Citrobacter rodentium is an enteric bacterial pathogen of the mouse intestinal tract that triggers inflammatory responses resembling those of humans infected with enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. Inflammasome signaling is emerging as a central regulator of inflammatory and host responses to several pathogens, but the in vivo role of inflammasome signaling in host defense against C. rodentium has not been characterized. Here, we show that mice lacking the inflammasome components Nlrp3, Nlrc4, and caspase-1 were hypersusceptible to C. rodentium-induced gastrointestinal inflammation. This was due to defective interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 production given that il-1β−/− and il-18−/− mice also suffered from increased bacterial burdens and exacerbated histopathology. C. rodentium specifically activated the Nlrp3 inflammasome in in vitro-infected macrophages independently of a functional bacterial type III secretion system. Thus, production of IL-1β and IL-18 downstream of the Nlrp3 and Nlrc4 inflammasomes plays a critical role in host defense against enteric infections caused by C. rodentium.

Thus, production of IL-1β and IL-18 downstream of the Nlrp3 and Nlrc4 inflammasomes plays a critical role in host defense against enteric infections caused by C. rodentium. Bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal tract represent a major cause of mortality worldwide and continue to threaten global health (1.Kappelman M.D. Rifas-Shiman S.L. Porter C.Q. Ollendorf D.A.

Enteric bacterial pathogens such as enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and enteropathogenic E. coli are responsible for a large number of cases of diarrhea, which cause significant morbidity and mortality among infants and children in the developing world (2.Kaper J.B. Nataro J.P. Mobley H.L. Pathogenic Escherichia coli.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 123-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). Much of our knowledge on the mechanisms by which the host immune system controls infection by enteric pathogens stems from experimental studies with Citrobacter rodentium, a naturally occurring pathogen that infects the rodent gastrointestinal tract (3.Borenshtein D. McBee M.E. Schauer D.B. Utility of the Citrobacter rodentium infection model in laboratory mice.Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 2008; 24: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As with enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic E. coli in humans, C. rodentium invasion of murine colonic epithelial cells results in the formation of lesions and mucosal hyperplasia (4.Mundy R.

Both innate immune cells and T cells, along with C. rodentium-specific antibody responses, contribute to containment and eradication of C. rodentium infection (5.Eckmann L. Animal models of inflammatory bowel disease: lessons from enteric infections.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1072: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, extracellular immune surveillance by members of the Toll-like receptor family is known to play a major role in host defense against C. rodentium infection (6.Gibson D.L. Ma C.

In addition, the role of the intracellular NOD-like receptor family members NOD1 and NOD2 in protection against C. rodentium infection has recently been characterized. NOD1 and NOD2 promote clearance of C. rodentium infection by inducing enteric innate T helper type 17 (iT(H)17) and T(H)1 responses in the gastrointestinal tract (9.Geddes K. Rubino S.J. Magalhaes J.G. Streutker C. Le Bourhis L. Cho J.H. Robertson S.J. Kim C.J. Kaul R. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E.

Unlike Nod1 and Nod2, which regulate MAP kinase and NF-κB signaling, a subset of NOD-like receptors that includes Nlrp3 and Nlrc4 controls innate immune responses by assembling inflammasomes. These multiprotein complexes are responsible for the activation of caspase-1 and subsequent production of bioactive interleukin IL-1β and IL-18 (11.Lamkanfi M. Walle L.V. Kanneganti T.D. Deregulated inflammasome signaling in disease.Immunol. Rev. 2011; 243: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Notably, C. rodentium was recently shown to induce noncanonical activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome in in vitro-infected macrophages (12.Kayagaki N. Warming S. Lamkanfi M. Vande Walle L. Louie S.

Noncanonical inflammasome activation targets caspase-11.Nature. 2011; 479: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed inflammasome activation during in vivo infection with C. rodentium and characterized the physiological role of inflammasome signaling in host defense against C. rodentium. Mice lacking the inflammasome components Nlrp3, Nlrc4, and caspase-1 were hypersusceptible to C. rodentium-induced gastrointestinal inflammation and failed to control C. rodentium as a consequence of defective production of IL-1β and IL-18. Concurrently, il-1β−/− and il-18−/− mice suffered from increased bacterial burden and presented with more inflammatory lesions in the gut. Notably, C. rodentium specifically required Nlrp3, but not Nlrc4 or Aim2, to induce activation of caspase-1 and secretion of IL-1β from in vitro-infected macrophages. Moreover, the bacterial type III secretion system was dispensable for Nlrp3 inflammasome activation. In conclusion, we show that Nlrp3 and Nlrc4 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β and IL-18 production is required for efficiently clearing C. rodentium infections in the gastrointestinal tract.

Colon homogenates were prepared mechanically in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The concentrations of mouse cytokines and chemokines in colon homogenates or cell supernatants were determined using multiplex ELISA (Millipore), IL-1β ELISA kit (eBioscience), or IL-18 ELISA kit (MBL International). Serum antibody analysis methods were modified as described previously (19.Bry L. Brenner M.B. Critical role of T cell-dependent serum antibody, but not the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, for surviving acute mucosal infection with Citrobacter rodentium, an attaching and effacing pathogen.J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, heated-killed C. rodentium were coated in ELISA plates overnight. After wash, plates were blocked with 5% milk for 1 h. Serum samples were assayed in triplicate and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Then Ig isotypes were detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG and IgM (Jackson Immunoresearch). After that, plates were developed with 3,3′, 5,5″-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and read at A450 after stopping reaction with 1 n H2SO4. Single cell suspensions were made from mouse spleen. Cells were stained with anti-CD11b (M1/70), CD11c (N418), Gr-1 (RB6–8C5), CD4 (RM4–5), and CD19 (6D5) (all from Biolegend) and CD8 (53–6.7) (from eBioscience). After staining, cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). For analysis of caspase-1 activation, tissue homogenate or BMDMs were denatured with SDS plus 100 mm DTT and boiled for 5 min. SDS-PAGE separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and immunoblotted with rabbit antibody against caspase-1. Data are represented as mean ± S.E. or S.D. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To examine the in vivo importance of inflammasome signaling in intestinal inflammation caused by C. rodentium infection, wild-type, Nlrp3−/−, and Casp1−/− mice were infected with C. rodentium at 4 × 109 cfu/mouse. Clinical manifestation of colitis was monitored during a course of 3 weeks by monitoring changes in body weight and bacterial burden in the stool. Casp1−/− mice were highly susceptible to C. rodentium infection as they lost significantly more body weight than wild-type mice from day 4 onward (Fig. 1A). Nlrp3−/− mice initially presented with a milder phenotype that gradually worsened in the course of the 3rd week (Fig. 1A). To further understand the roles of inflammasome signaling in C. rodentium infection, cfu in feces of Nlrp3−/− and Casp1−/− mice were determined at days 10, 17, and 21 after infection. In agreement with the differential changes in body weight at day 10 after infection, C. rodentium counts were initially comparably elevated in wild-type and Nlrp3−/− mice (∼107 cfu/g feces) (Fig. 1B). In contrast, cfu in Casp1−/− mice were significantly higher at this time point (∼108 cfu/g feces). At day 17, bacterial burden in wild-type mice markedly dropped to 103–104 cfu/g feces, whereas cfu remained elevated in Nlrp3−/− and Casp1−/− mice (106–109 cfu/g feces). This suggests that wild-type mice successfully started clearing the C. rodentium infection at this time point, whereas defective inflammasome signaling in Nlrp3−/− and Casp1−/− mice hampered this process. To obtain additional evidence of increased susceptibility to C. rodentium-induced colitis in inflammasome-deficient mice, we examined the gross anatomy and histology of the colon at days 14 and 21 after infection. Shortening and thickening of the colon are hallmark features of C. rodentium-induced colitis (4.Mundy R. MacDonald T.T. Dougan G. Frankel G. Wiles S. Citrobacter rodentium of mice and man.Cell. Microbiol. 2005; 7: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Consistent with the increased body weight loss and higher bacterial burden in inflammasome-deficient mice, colons of Casp1−/− mice were significantly shorter and thicker than those of wild-type mice (Fig. 1, C and D). A tendency toward slightly shorter colons was observed in Nlrp3−/− mice, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance (Fig. 1D). The delayed onset of body weight loss and increases in bacterial burden in Nlrp3−/− mice (Fig. 1, A and B) might be explained by redundant mechanisms contributing to caspase-1 activation in response to infection with C. rodentium. Indeed, Nlrc4−/− mice that were infected with C. rodentium as described above resembled Nlrp3−/− mice in that C. rodentium counts in the stool were normal at day 10, but markedly increased at days 17 and 21 after infection (supplemental Fig. S1). The clinical manifestation of increased colon inflammation in Nlrp3−/− and Casp1−/− mice was confirmed by histological analysis. H&E-stained colon sections of C. rodentium-infected Nlrp3−/− and Casp1−/− mice showed increased inflammation in the lamina propria along with elongated crypts and hyperplasia in inflammasome-deficient mice (Fig. 1E). Semiquantitative scoring of inflammation, edema, hyperplasia, and the extent of colonic damage confirmed that colitis severity was significantly higher in the Nlrp3−/− and Casp1−/− cohorts relative to the levels seen in wild-type mice (Fig. 1, F and G). Cytokines and chemokines play central roles in shaping inflammatory and host defense responses against microbial pathogens. To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms contributing to increased colitis in the absence of a functional inflammasome, we measured the local production of a variety of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in C. rodentium-infected wild-type and Casp1−/− mice. Compared with wild-type mice, colon homogenates of Casp1−/− mice contained markedly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, MIP2, KC, and MCP-1 at both days 14 (Fig. 2A) and 21 (Fig. 2B) after infection. These results suggest that defective inflammasome activation leads to increased local production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the gastrointestinal tract of C. rodentium-infected animals. To characterize the cell types contributing to production of these inflammatory mediators, we analyzed the immune cell populations migrating to the colon and secondary lymphoid tissues of C. rodentium-infected wild-type and Casp1−/− mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of micrographs stained for F4/80 and Gr-1 showed a markedly increased infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils in colons of Casp1−/− mice at day 21 after infection (Fig. 3A). This was associated with splenomegaly in Casp1−/− mice as evidenced by the doubled splenic size and weight (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B) compared with wild-type mice at day 14 after infection. Analysis of splenic immune cell populations showed that both the total myeloid cell (CD11b+) population as well as the subpopulations of neutrophils (CD11b+Gr1+) and dendritic cells (CD11b+CD11c+) were significantly elevated in Casp1−/− mice at day 14 (Fig. 3B). The elevated proinflammatory cytokine production and immune cell infiltration in C. rodentium-infected Casp1−/− colons were accompanied by a markedly increased bacterial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 3C). In situ Gram staining of wild-type and Casp1−/− colon sections confirmed an augmented bacterial presence in the mucosal tissue of Casp1−/− colons relative to wild-type colons at day 14 after C. rodentium infection (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the increased inflammatory responses in Casp1−/− colons may be due to the uncontrolled proliferation of C. rodentium in the absence of a functional inflammasome. T cell and humoral responses have previously been implicated in host defense against C. rodentium (19.Bry L. Brenner M.B. Critical role of T cell-dependent serum antibody, but not the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, for surviving acute mucosal infection with Citrobacter rodentium, an attaching and effacing pathogen.J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 20.Simmons C.P. Clare S. Ghaem-Maghami M. Uren T.K. Rankin J. Huett A. Goldin R. Lewis D.J. MacDonald T.T. Strugnell R.A. Frankel G. Dougan G. Central role for B lymphocytes and CD4+ T cells in immunity to infection by the attaching and effacing pathogen Citrobacter rodentium.Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5077-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To investigate whether caspase-1 deficiency affects C. rodentium-induced adaptive immune responses, we first determined CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ cell numbers in the spleen of infected wild-type and Casp1−/− mice at days 14 and 21 after infection. Whereas T and B lymphocyte numbers in the spleens were comparable in the two genotypes at early stages of infection (days 0 and 14), Casp1−/− mice had significantly more CD8+ and CD19+ cells in the spleen at day 21 after infection (Fig. 4, A–C), suggesting that defective inflammasome activation is associated with enhanced adaptive immune responses. Concurrently, serum IgG and IgM levels were also higher in C. rodentium-infected Casp1−/− mice than the levels detected in circulation of wild-type mice (Fig. 4, D and E). To confirm that the host responds to infection with C. rodentium by activating inflammasomes in the gastrointestinal tract, we monitored caspase-1 maturation by Western blotting in colon samples of wild-type (C57BL/6) mice that had been infected orally with C. rodentium for 14 days. As expected, procaspase-1 was matured into a 20-kDa fragment in colon samples of C. rodentium-infected wild-type mice, but not in colon samples of uninfected animals (Fig. 5A). The antibody failed to detect immunoreactive bands in lysates of Casp1−/− mice, demonstrating the specificity of these results (data not shown). Inflammasomes are responsible for the proteolytic maturation and secretion of bioactive IL-1β and IL-18 (11.Lamkanfi M. Walle L.V. Kanneganti T.D. Deregulated inflammasome signaling in disease.Immunol. Rev. 2011; 243: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To examine whether the increased susceptibility and elevated cytokine production in Casp1−/− mice could be attributed to defective production of IL-1β and IL-18, we measured colonic levels of these inflammasome-dependent cytokines. Wild-type mice produced high levels of IL-18 at day 14 after infection (Fig. 5B), whereas IL-1β production in the colon was not easily detected (data not shown). Unlike wild-type mice, IL-18 levels were markedly reduced in colons of C. rodentium-infected Casp1−/− mice, whereas Nlrp3−/− mice had intermediate levels of IL-18 (Fig. 5B), suggesting a critical role for this cytokine in regulating susceptibility to C. rodentium. To examine the role of IL-18 in additional detail, wild-type and il-18−/− mice were infected with C. rodentium to determine bacterial burden and histological lesions as described above. At day 14 after infection, C. rodentium counts and histological lesions were significantly higher in il-18−/− mice than in wild-type mice (Fig. 5, C and D), confirming the role of IL-18 in host defense against C. rodentium. We next examined the potential role of IL-1β in C. rodentium infection. Similar to il-18−/− mice, mice lacking IL-1β had significantly higher C. rodentium cfu in the stool (Fig. 5E) and markedly more colonic histological lesions than the control group (Fig. 5F). Analysis of H&E-stained colon sections of C. rodentium-infected WT, il-1β−/−, and il-18−/− mice confirmed that mice lacking either of the inflammasome-dependent cytokines displayed increased histopathology and hyperplasia (Fig. 5G). These data support the notion that both IL-1β and IL-18 production downstream of inflammasomes regulates replication of C. rodentium in the colon. C. rodentium infection of BMDMs was recently shown to induce noncanonical caspase-1 activation downstream of Nlrp3 and caspase-11 (12.Kayagaki N. Warming S. Lamkanfi M. Vande Walle L. Louie S. Dong J. Newton K. Qu Y. Liu J. Heldens S. Zhang J. Lee W.P. Roose-Girma M. Dixit V.M. Noncanonical inflammasome activation targets caspase-11.Nature. 2011; 479: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). In agreement, C. rodentium induced caspase-1 maturation in wild-type BMDMs, but not in macrophages lacking Nlrp3 (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the Nlrc4 and AIM2 inflammasomes were dispensable for C. rodentium-induced caspase-1 activation because caspase-1 processing was not affected in Nlrc4−/− and Aim2−/− macrophages (Fig. 6A). Concurrently, significant production of IL-1β (Fig. 6, B and C) and IL-18 (Fig. 6, D and E) was observed in wild-type, Nlrc4−/−, and Aim2−/− macrophages, but not in Nlrp3−/− and Casp1−/− BMDMs. Together, these results suggest that C. rodentium activates caspase-1 specifically through the Nlrp3 inflammasome in infected macrophages. Effector proteins secreted through type III secretion systems (T3SS) are critical for bacterial virulence. For instance, C. rodentium T3SS mediates translocation of multiple effector proteins that are required for bacterial virulence in mice (21.Deng W. Puente J.L. Gruenheid S. Li Y. Vallance B.A. Vázquez A. Barba J. Ibarra J.A. O'Donnell P. Metalnikov P. Ashman K. Lee S. Goode D. Pawson T. Finlay B.B.

Lupp C. Vázquez A. Mascarenhas M. Coburn B. Coombes B.K. Karmali M.A. Puente J.L. Deng W. Finlay B.B. Citrobacter rodentium virulence in mice associates with bacterial load and the type III effector NleE.Microbes. Infect. 2007; 9: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To examine whether C. rodentium T3SS is implicated in inflammasome activation, BMDMs were infected with wild-type C. rodentium or the ΔescC and ΔescN mutants lacking essential structural components that render the T3SS inactive (22.Wickham M.E. Lupp C. Vázquez A. Mascarenhas M. Coburn B. Coombes B.K. Karmali M.A. Puente J.L. Deng W. Finlay B.B. Citrobacter rodentium virulence in mice associates with bacterial load and the type III effector NleE.Microbes. Infect. 2007; 9: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Notably, BMDMs infected with wild-type C. rodentium secreted levels of IL-1β (Fig. 7, A and B) and IL-18 (Fig. 7 C, and D) in the culture supernatants similar to those infected with the ΔescC and ΔescN mutants. In agreement, caspase-1 processing in BMDMs infected with the mutant bacterial strains was similar to the levels seen in BMDMs infected with wild-type C. rodentium (Fig. 7E). These results suggest that C. rodentium activates the Nlrp3 inflammasome independently of T3SS effectors, raising the possibility that the Nlrp3 inflammasome may detect C. rodentium indirectly through some other non-type III bacterial component (e.g. LPS, flagellin, or peptidoglycan). Enteric bacterial pathogens represent a major public health problem in the developing world because of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with severe diarrhea in infants and children (2.Kaper J.B. Nataro J.P. Mobley H.L. Pathogenic Escherichia coli.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 123-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that innate immune cells, T cell responses, and antibody production all contribute to containment and eradication of enteric infections (5.Eckmann L. Animal models of inflammatory bowel disease: lessons from enteric infections.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1072: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For example, extracellular immune surveillance by members of the Toll-like receptor family was shown to be critical for host defense against C. rodentium infection (6.Gibson D.L. Ma C. Bergstrom K.S. Huang J.T. Man C. Vallance B.A. MyD88 signalling plays a critical role in host defence by controlling pathogen burden and promoting epithelial cell homeostasis during Citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis.Cell.

TLR signaling mediated by MyD88 is required for a protective innate immune response by neutrophils to Citrobacter rodentium.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). More recently, the role of the intracellular NOD-like receptor family members NOD1 and NOD2 in protection against C. rodentium infection has been demonstrated (9.Geddes K. Rubino S.J. Magalhaes J.G. Streutker C. Le Bourhis L. Cho J.H. Robertson S.J. Kim C.J. Kaul R. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. Identification of an innate T helper type 17 response to intestinal bacterial pathogens.Nat.

The Nod2 sensor promotes intestinal pathogen eradication via the chemokine CCL2-dependent recruitment of inflammatory monocytes.Immunity. 2011; 34: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, the importance of inflammasome signaling in protection against enteric infections caused by C. rodentium has not been described. Our data demonstrated that mice lacking the inflammasome components Nlrp3, Nlrc4, and caspase-1 are hypersusceptible to C. rodentium-induced gastrointestinal inflammation because of their failure to produce normal levels of IL-1β and IL-18. Defective inflammasome-mediated cytokine production was associated with increased destruction of the colonic epithelium, higher bacterial burden, and elevated immune cell infiltration and production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The importance of IL-1β and IL-18 in this process was confirmed by the observation that il-1β−/− and il-18−/− mice suffered from increased bacterial burden and colon pathology. In cultured macrophages, C. rodentium activated caspase-1 and induced secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 through noncanonical activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome. Recent work showed that available caspase-1-deficient mouse lines fail to express caspase-11 and implicated both inflammatory caspases in C. rodentium-induced IL-1β and IL-18 secretion from infected macrophages (12.Kayagaki N. Warming S. Lamkanfi M. Vande Walle L. Louie S. Dong J. Newton K. Qu Y. Liu J. Heldens S. Zhang J. Lee W.P. Roose-Girma M. Dixit V.M. Noncanonical inflammasome activation targets caspase-11.Nature. 2011; 479: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that the bacterial T3SS and the Nlrc4 inflammasome were dispensable for C. rodentium-induced caspase-1 activation in macrophages. However, given the importance of Nlrc4 in in vivo resistance to C. rodentium infection, the Nlrc4 inflammasome may nevertheless contribute to caspase-1 activation and inflammasome-dependent cytokine secretion in other cell types. Alternatively, the complex microbial context of the gastrointestinal tract may provide an explanation. Damage to the epithelial layer due to colonic infection with C. rodentium may allow opportunistic infections with commensal bacteria. Thus, during in vivo infections with C. rodentium, host inflammasome activation may not solely depend on C. rodentium, but multiple other bacterial species. Consequently, both the Nlrp3 and Nlrc4 inflammasomes may be activated during C. rodentium infection in vivo. Regardless, our results suggest that therapies aimed at modulating inflammasome activation may provide novel approaches for controlling inflammation and infections of the gastrointestinal tract.

https://openalex.org/W2141720172,"Chiral Ice Water ice, even at the lowest temperatures, is not completely “frozen”—its lattice structure allows for multiple equivalent ground states and it thus retains finite entropy even at absolute zero. Equivalent structures are realized in frustrated magnets called spin ices, where spins interact ferromagnetically, and in the even more exotic artificial spin ices, which are fabricated arrays of nanoscale magnets. Branford et al. (p. 1597 ) studied the transport behavior of an artificial spin ice with a honeycomb geometry during upward and downward sweeps of an external magnetic field, which revealed a field-asymmetric peak when the magnetic field was applied parallel to the current and the voltage was measured transversely. Micromagnetic simulations suggest that the asymmetric response is a result of the loops of opposite handedness forming at the edges of the sample, resulting in an overall chirality of the transport response."
https://openalex.org/W2069428597,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lipid that serves as an extracellular signaling molecule acting through cognate G protein-coupled receptors designated LPA(1-6) that mediate a wide range of both normal and pathological effects. Previously, LPA(1), a G(αi)-coupled receptor (which also couples to other G(α) proteins) to reduce cAMP, was shown to be essential for the initiation of neuropathic pain in the partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL) mouse model. Subsequent gene expression studies identified LPA(5), a G(α12/13)- and G(q)-coupled receptor that increases cAMP, in a subset of dorsal root ganglion neurons and also within neurons of the spinal cord dorsal horn in a pattern complementing, yet distinct from LPA(1), suggesting its possible involvement in neuropathic pain. We therefore generated an Lpar5 null mutant by targeted deletion followed by PSNL challenge. Homozygous null mutants did not show obvious base-line phenotypic defects. However, following PSNL, LPA(5)-deficient mice were protected from developing neuropathic pain. They also showed reduced phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein expression within neurons of the dorsal horn despite continued up-regulation of the characteristic pain-related markers Caα(2)δ(1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein, results that were distinct from those previously observed for LPA(1) deletion. These data expand the influences of LPA signaling in neuropathic pain through a second LPA receptor subtype, LPA(5), involving a mechanistically distinct downstream signaling pathway compared with LPA(1)."
https://openalex.org/W2154518193,"The 142Nd/144Nd ratio of the Earth is greater than the solar ratio as inferred from chondritic meteorites, which challenges a fundamental assumption of modern geochemistry—that the composition of the silicate Earth is ‘chondritic’, meaning that it has refractory element ratios identical to those found in chondrites. The popular explanation for this and other paradoxes of mantle geochemistry, a hidden layer deep in the mantle enriched in incompatible elements, is inconsistent with the heat flux carried by mantle plumes. Either the matter from which the Earth formed was not chondritic, or the Earth has lost matter by collisional erosion in the later stages of planet formation. The hidden-reservoir explanation for the non-chondritic composition of the accessible Earth is inconsistent with the heat carried by mantle plumes, which suggests that the whole Earth is not chondritic, perhaps due to preferential loss of crusts from precursor bodies by collisional erosion during accretion. In this Perspective article, Ian Campbell and Hugh O'Neill question the long-held assumption that Earth's geochemical composition is chondritic — that is, it has the same element ratios as chondritic meteorites, and hence the early Solar System. As differences between the Earth's composition and that of chondrites have emerged — anomalous neodymium-isotope ratios, for instance — they have generally been explained by invoking hidden reservoirs. Now Campbell and O'Neill suggest that the accumulating evidence is sufficient to raise doubts over the model itself. It might be possible to resolve the matter by analysing element ratios in samples from Earth's earliest and most primitive mantle, to be found in association with the heads of mantle plumes."

https://openalex.org/W1971319553,"Cost-Benefit Analysis Mounting resistance to infection is costly, requires energetic input, and may thus compromise fecundity. Duffy et al. (p. 1636 ; see the cover) tested the relationships between productivity, predation, and mortality in a combination of observations of a natural lake and an experimental replica of a clonal zooplankton-parasitic yeast population. In the wild, epidemics of the yeast could exceed 60% and cause significant host mortality. In this situation, the clonal zooplankton host faces the physiological dilemma of either increasing resistance to deal with infection or of safeguarding fecundity. Zooplankton that feed quickly can reproduce quickly, but also end up ingesting more yeast spores. However, because fish tend to cull infected hosts, fish predation counters infection. Ultimately, both wild and model systems showed that lakes with high productivity (more nitrogen) and/or few fish supported greater epidemics of yeast and more resistant hosts, whereas less productive lakes, or those with more fish, had smaller epidemics and hosts with higher susceptibility to the yeast."

Rogulja and Young (p. 1617 ) searched for genes in neurons whose products regulated sleep. Depletion of the protein regulator of cyclin A1 (Rca1) caused the flies to be slow to go to sleep and to get less total sleep in a day because their sleep episodes were shorter. The mechanism by which Rca1 influences sleep is not yet clear. It appears not to disrupt circadian rhythms. However, the neurons that express Rca1 in the fly brain are located near the neurons that make up the circadian clock, potentially allowing for coordination of circadian behavior with sleep regulation."

However, direct interactions of LECs with immune cells have yet to be investigated. In vitro studies were performed to characterize primary cultures of human LECs derived from LNs in their capacity of interacting with T cells. The results show that LECs express HLA molecules and functional costimulatory molecules needed for T-cell activation. A direct binding of LECs and T cells was detected in cell cultures connected with a clustering of costimulatory molecules on the contact phase. LECs were also able to take up and process antigens. However, major histocompatibility complex class II+ LECs fail to induce allogeneic T-cell proliferation. Interestingly, supernatants of IFN-γ activated LECs impair proliferation of T cells cocultured with allogeneic dendritic cells, suggesting an inhibitory role of LECs. Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase was identified as one inhibitory molecule, which may be responsible for the impaired CD4+ T-cell proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2011628385,"Understanding the dynamics of correlated many-body quantum systems is a challenge for modern physics. Owing to the simplicity of their Hamiltonians, (4)He (bosons) and (3)He (fermions) have served as model systems for strongly interacting quantum fluids, with substantial efforts devoted to their understanding. An important milestone was the direct observation of the collective phonon-roton mode in liquid (4)He by neutron scattering, verifying Landau's prediction and his fruitful concept of elementary excitations. In a Fermi system, collective density fluctuations (known as 'zero-sound' in (3)He, and 'plasmons' in charged systems) and incoherent particle-hole excitations are observed. At small wavevectors and energies, both types of excitation are described by Landau's theory of Fermi liquids. At higher wavevectors, the collective mode enters the particle-hole band, where it is strongly damped. The dynamics of Fermi liquids at high wavevectors was thus believed to be essentially incoherent. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering measurements of a monolayer of liquid (3)He, observing a roton-like excitation. We find that the collective density mode reappears as a well defined excitation at momentum transfers larger than twice the Fermi momentum. We thus observe unexpected collective behaviour of a Fermi many-body system in the regime beyond the scope of Landau's theory. A satisfactory interpretation of the measured spectra is obtained using a dynamic many-body theory."

Both methylation and deletion of GPx3 gene underlie the alterations of GPx3 expression in prostate cancer. A strong correlation between the down-regulation of GPx3 expression and progression of prostate cancer and the suppression of prostate cancer xenografts in SCID mice by forced expression of GPx3 suggests a tumor suppression role of GPx3 in prostate cancer. However, the mechanism of GPx3-mediated tumor suppression remains unclear. In this report, GPx3 was found to interact directly with p53-induced gene 3 (PIG3). Forced overexpression of GPx3 in prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC3 as well as immortalized prostate epithelial cells RWPE-1 increased apoptotic cell death. Expression of GPx3x73c, a peroxidase-negative OPAL codon mutant, in DU145 and PC3 cells also increased cell death. The induced expression of GPx3 in DU145 and PC3 cells resulted in an increase in reactive oxygen species and caspase-3 activity. These activities were abrogated by either knocking down PIG3 or mutating the PIG3 binding motif in GPx3 or binding interference from a peptide corresponding to PIG3 binding motif in GPx3. In addition, UV-treated RWPE-1 cells underwent apoptotic death, which was partially prevented by knocking down GPx3 or PIG3, suggesting that GPx3-PIG3 signaling is critical for UV-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results reveal a novel signaling pathway of GPx3-PIG3 in the regulation of cell death in prostate cancer.

Forced overexpression of GPx3 in prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC3 as well as immortalized prostate epithelial cells RWPE-1 increased apoptotic cell death. Expression of GPx3x73c, a peroxidase-negative OPAL codon mutant, in DU145 and PC3 cells also increased cell death. The induced expression of GPx3 in DU145 and PC3 cells resulted in an increase in reactive oxygen species and caspase-3 activity. These activities were abrogated by either knocking down PIG3 or mutating the PIG3 binding motif in GPx3 or binding interference from a peptide corresponding to PIG3 binding motif in GPx3. In addition, UV-treated RWPE-1 cells underwent apoptotic death, which was partially prevented by knocking down GPx3 or PIG3, suggesting that GPx3-PIG3 signaling is critical for UV-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results reveal a novel signaling pathway of GPx3-PIG3 in the regulation of cell death in prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2039558245,"The transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel is a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel whose activation results from a complex synergy between distinct activation sites, one of which is especially important for determining its sensitivity to chemical, voltage and cold stimuli. From the cytoplasmic side, TRPA1 is critically regulated by Ca(2+) ions, and this mechanism represents a self-modulating feedback loop that first augments and then inhibits the initial activation. We investigated the contribution of the cluster of acidic residues in the distal C terminus of TRPA1 in these processes using mutagenesis, whole cell electrophysiology, and molecular dynamics simulations and found that the neutralization of four conserved residues, namely Glu(1077) and Asp(1080)-Asp(1082) in human TRPA1, had strong effects on the Ca(2+)- and voltage-dependent potentiation and/or inactivation of agonist-induced responses. The surprising finding was that truncation of the C terminus by only 20 residues selectively slowed down the Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation 2.9-fold without affecting other functional parameters. Our findings identify the conserved acidic motif in the C terminus that is actively involved in TRPA1 regulation by Ca(2+)."

One of the most prominent is Alzheimer disease in which aggregation and deposition of the Aβ peptide occur. Aβ is widely considered to mediate the extensive neuronal loss observed in this disease through the formation of soluble oligomeric species, with the final fibrillar end product of the aggregation process being relatively inert. Factors that influence the aggregation of these amyloid-forming proteins are therefore very important. We have screened a library of 96 amphipathic molecules for effects on Aβ1–42 aggregation and self-association. We find, using thioflavin T fluorescence and electron microscopy assays, that 30 of the molecules inhibit the aggregation process, whereas 36 activate fibril formation. Several activators and inhibitors were subjected to further analysis using analytical ultracentrifugation and circular dichroism. Activators typically display a 1:10 peptide:detergent stoichiometry for maximal activation, whereas the inhibitors are effective at a 1:1 stoichiometry. Analytical ultracentrifugation and circular dichroism experiments show that activators promote a mixture of unfolded and β-sheet structures and rapidly form large aggregates, whereas inhibitors induce α-helical structures that form stable dimeric/trimeric oligomers. The results suggest that Aβ1–42 contains at least one small molecule binding site, which modulates the secondary structure and aggregation processes. Further studies of the binding of these compounds to Aβ may provide insight for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at stabilizing Aβ in a favorable conformation.

https://openalex.org/W2105630572,"Three forms of serpinin peptides, serpinin (Ala26Leu), pyroglutaminated (pGlu)-serpinin (pGlu23Leu), and serpinin-Arg-Arg-Gly (Ala29Gly), are derived from cleavage at pairs of basic residues in the highly conserved C terminus of chromogranin A (CgA). Serpinin induces PN-1 expression in neuroendocrine cells to up-regulate granule biogenesis via a cAMP-protein kinase A-Sp1 pathway, while pGlu-serpinin inhibits cell death. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that serpinin peptides are produced in the heart and act as novel β-adrenergic-like cardiac modulators. We detected serpinin peptides in the rat heart by HPLC and ELISA methods. The peptides included predominantly Ala29Gly and pGlu-serpinin and a small amount of serpinin. Using the Langendorff perfused rat heart to evaluate the hemodynamic changes, we found that serpinin and pGlu-serpinin exert dose-dependent positive inotropic and lusitropic effects at 11–165 nM, within the first 5 min after administration. The pGlu-serpinin-induced contractility is more potent than that of serpinin, starting from 1 nM. Using the isolated rat papillary muscle preparation to measure contractility in terms of tension development and muscle length, we further corroborated the pGlu-serpinin-induced positive inotropism. Ala29Gly was unable to affect myocardial performance. Both pGlu-serpinin and serpinin act through a β1-adrenergic receptor/adenylate cyclase/cAMP/PKA pathway, indicating that, contrary to the β-blocking profile of the other CgA-derived cardiosuppressive peptides, vasostatin-1 and catestatin, these two C-terminal peptides act as β-adrenergic-like agonists. In cardiac tissue extracts, pGluserpinin increased intracellular cAMP levels and phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN)Ser16, ERK1/2, and GSK-3β. Serpinin and pGlu-serpinin peptides emerge as novel β-adrenergic inotropic and lusitropic modulators, suggesting that CgA and the other derived cardioactive peptides can play a key role in how the myocardium orchestrates its complex response to sympathochromaffin stimulation.—Tota, B., Gentile, S., Pasqua, T., Bassino, E., Koshimizu, H., Cawley, N.

Importantly, in the absence and/or interference with MHC-I/CD8 interactions, regulatory functions were subverted, resulting in the loss of suppression. Indeed, under these conditions nTregs were converted into pathogenic effector cells, enhancing lung allergic responses in sensitized and challenged mice (8.Joetham A. Matsubara S. Okamoto M.

In this study, we defined the signaling pathways activated through GITR in nTregs in vitro and in vivo and determined the impact of interfering with activation on the expression of surface receptors, production of immunosuppressive cytokines, suppression of proliferation of activated T cells, and the consequences in the airways of allergen-sensitized and challenged mice. Pathogen-free, 6–8-week-old female C57BL/6 and JNK−/− mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). GITR−/− mice were kindly provided by Dr. Carlo Riccardi (Perugia, Italy). All mice were maintained on an OVA-free diet, and all protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National Jewish Health. Sensitization was carried out by intraperitoneal injection of 20 μg of OVA (Sigma) emulsified in 2.25 mg of alum hydroxide (AlumImject; Pierce) in a total volume of 100 μl on days 1 and 14. Sensitized and challenged mice, denoted OVA/OVA, and nonsensitized but challenged littermates (PBS/OVA) received aerosol challenges for 20 min each day on 3 consecutive days (days 26, 27, and 28) with 1% OVA in PBS using an ultrasonic nebulizer (Omron, Vernon Hills, IL) (10.Stephens G.L.

Airway responsiveness was assessed 48 h following the last challenge as a change in airway function to increasing concentrations of aerosolized methacholine administered for 10 s (60 breaths/min, 500 μl of tidal volume). Lung resistance was continuously computed (Labview, National Instruments, TX) by fitting flow, volume, and pressure to an equation of motion. Maximum values of lung resistance were taken and expressed as the percent change from base line following PBS aerosol. Immediately following measurement of AHR, lungs were lavaged. Total leukocyte numbers were counted (Coulter Counter, Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL), and differential cell counts were performed in a blinded manner under light microscopy by counting at least 200 cells on cytocentrifuged preparations (Cytospin 2; Cytospin, Shandon Ltd., Runcorn, Cheshire, UK) stained with Leukostat (Fisher Diagnostics, Middletown, VA) and differentiated by standard hematological procedures. CD4+CD25+ and CD4+ CD25− T cells from naive C57BL/6, JNK−/−, and GITR−/− donors were isolated by collagenase digestion from lungs and enriched using nylon wool columns as described previously (10.Stephens G.L.

ELISAs were performed according to the manufacturers' directions. The limits of detection were 4 pg/ml for IL-4 and IL-5, 10 pg/ml for IL-10 and IFN-γ, 8 pg/ml for IL-13, and 6 pg/ml for TGF-β. Isolated cells, following preincubation with naive mouse serum in staining buffer (PBS, 2% FCS, 0.2% sodium azide), were labeled with the following conjugated antibodies purchased from Pharmingen: anti-CD3 FITC, PE, PerCP, and allophycocyanin (17A2); anti-CD4 FITC, PE, PerCP, and APC (L3T4); anti-CD25 FITC (7D4) and PE (PC61); anti-GITR FITC, PE, and APC (DTA-1); CD152 FITC and PE APC (9H10). For intracellular staining, cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 ng/ml) and ionomycin (2 μg/ml, Sigma) in complete medium overnight and for 6 h in the presence of brefeldin A (10 μg/ml, Sigma). Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.5% saponin, and stained with anti-IL-10 PE and APC (JES5-16E3); IFN-γ PE and APC (XMG1.2); and Foxp3 PE and TGF-β (A75-3.1) (eBioscience). Fluorochrome (FITC, PE, PerCPAPC)-labeled isotype-matched control antibodies were used for background fluorescence staining. Staining was analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Pharmingen) using CellQuest Pro software. Fluorescence intensity was compared with cells stained with the corresponding labeled isotype-matched controls. Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Bio-Rad iScript cDNA synthesis kit. TaqMan primers and probes for mouse Foxp3 and GAPDH were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Carlsbad, CA). Real time PCR was performed using ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system. Relative amounts of cDNA were normalized by subtracting the threshold cycle (Ct) of internal GAPDH reference gene to target gene generating a ΔCt value. Relative mRNA expression of specific gene was obtained by using the formula 2^ (−ΔCt). Cells (5 × 106) were lysed with RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) on ice. Lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blotted membranes were blocked in TBST buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, 0.025% Tween 20) containing 2% BSA (Promega, Madison, WI) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with TBST buffer containing 2% BSA with anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK, anti-phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling), anti-ERK, anti-p38 MAPK, anti-JNK, anti-MAPK kinases 4 and 7, anti-c-Jun, anti-p-c-Jun, anti-p50, anti-p65, anti-c-Rel mAbs, or anti-IκB-α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA or Cell Signaling). Specific proteins were detected by a chemiluminescence method using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-goat, or anti mouse IgG Ab (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive bands were quantified by densitometric quantification of autoradiographs using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) and expressed as relative phosphorylated kinase to total kinase or β-actin normalized to the unstimulated, untreated cells. The assay for JNK activity was performed according to the manufacturer's directions (SAPK/JNK kinase assay, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Briefly, similar amounts of cell lysate from the different cell groups were incubated with the recommended amount of immobilized c-Jun fusion protein overnight. Mixtures were washed extensively with 1× cell lysis buffer and the kinase buffer. SAPK phosphorylation of c-Jun substrate was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C by adding the same volume of 1× kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP. The reaction was terminated with 25 μl of 3× SDS. The supernatants were then prepared for standard Western immunoblotting probing for p-c-Jun. Isolated WT CD4+CD25− (2.5 × 104) cells were first activated with bound anti-CD3 (2 μg/ml, 17A2) and soluble anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml, 37.51; both from eBioscience) cultured with or without CD4+CD25+ T cells treated with active (SP600125) or inactive JNKi (25 μm, both from Calbiochem) and then stimulated with GITRL (1 μg/ml, R&D Systems) at a 1:1 ratio in complete medium. GITR-stimulated CD4+CD25+ T cells were carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester-labeled for dilution assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (eBioscience). Cultures were pulsed during the final 6 h with 1 μCi/well thymidine, and cell proliferation was determined as counts/min. Lungs were fixed by inflation (1 ml) and immersion in 10% formalin. Cells containing eosinophilic major basic protein were identified by immunohistochemical staining as described previously using rabbit anti-mouse major basic protein (kindly provided by Dr. J. J. Lee, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ). The slides were examined in a blinded fashion with a Nikon light microscope. Numbers of eosinophils in the tissues were evaluated with ImageJ counting 6–8 different fields per animal. For detection of mucus-containing cells in formalin-fixed airway tissue, sections were stained with periodic acid-Schiff. Analysis of variance was used to determine statistical significance. Comparisons for all pairs were performed by the Tukey-Kramer highest significant difference test. The p values for significance were set to 0.05. Values for all measurements were expressed as the means ± S.E. In mammalian cells, three main families of the MAPKs, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38, have been implicated in developing immune responses, and individual MAPKs are activated by different stimuli (26.Dong C. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. MAPKs in the immune response.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). Although p38 (27.Adler H.S. Kubsch S. Graulich E. Ludwig S.

We investigated the activation of the MAPK pathways in nTregs following GITR stimulation with different concentrations of GITRL (Fig. 1, A–C). Compared with nonstimulated cells, GITRL significantly increased the phosphorylation of JNK without evidence for activation of ERK or p38, as determined by densitometric quantification of immunoreactive bands on autoradiographs. Total JNK, ERK, and p38 were unchanged under all conditions. In contrast to CD4+CD25+ T cells, CD4+CD25− T cells, which express lower levels of GITR (8.Joetham A. Matsubara S. Okamoto M. Takeda K.

Similar to other MAPKs, full activation of JNK requires dual phosphorylation on Thr-183 and Tyr-184 of the tripeptide motif (Thr-Xaa-Tyr) (30.Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T.

In an animal model, treatment with SP600125 was shown to reduce airway inflammation and levels of OVA-IgE in the serum of sensitized and challenged mice (32.Chialda L. Zhang M. Brune K. Pahl A.

Pretreatment of nTregs with the active but not inactive JNK inhibitor (JNKi) decreased GITRL-induced phosphorylation of JNK (Fig. 2A). The specificity of activation of JNK following GITR ligation was confirmed by comparing nTregs from wild-type (WT) with nTregs from JNK−/− or GITR−/− mice. JNK activity detected as phosphorylation of c-Jun (p-c-Jun) was only detected in the immunoprecipitates fro"
https://openalex.org/W2011252500,"Transcription termination is emerging as an important component of gene regulation necessary to partition the genome and minimize transcriptional interference. We have discovered a role for the Arabidopsis RNA silencing enzyme DICER-LIKE 4 (DCL4) in transcription termination of an endogenous Arabidopsis gene, FCA. DCL4 directly associates with FCA chromatin in the 3' region and promotes cleavage of the nascent transcript in a domain downstream of the canonical polyA site. In a dcl4 mutant, the resulting transcriptional read-through triggers an RNA interference-mediated gene silencing of a transgene containing the same 3' region. We conclude that DCL4 promotes transcription termination of the Arabidopsis FCA gene, reducing the amount of aberrant RNA produced from the locus."

https://openalex.org/W2031993474,"In addition to its classical CD40 receptor, CD154 also binds to αIIbβ3, α5β1, and αMβ2 integrins. Binding of CD154 to these receptors seems to play a key role in the pathogenic processes of chronic inflammation. This investigation was aimed at analyzing the functional interaction of CD154 with CD40, αIIbβ3, and α5β1 receptors. We found that the binding affinity of CD154 for αIIbβ3 is ∼4-fold higher than for α5β1. We also describe the generation of sCD154 mutants that lost their ability to bind CD40 or αIIbβ3 and show that CD154 residues involved in its binding to CD40 or αIIbβ3 are distinct from those implicated in its interaction to α5β1, suggesting that sCD154 may bind simultaneously to different receptors. Indeed, sCD154 can bind simultaneously to CD40 and α5β1 and biologically activate human monocytic U937 cells expressing both receptors.

CD154, also known as CD40 ligand (CD40L) or gp39, is a type II transmembrane protein that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, expressed on a variety of activated hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells (1.van Kooten C. Banchereau J. Functional role of CD40 and its ligand.Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1997; 113: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2.Schönbeck U. Libby P. The CD40/CD154 receptor/ligand dyad.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD154 expression on T cells is triggered primarily by T cell receptor signaling and is regulated by CD28-dependent and -independent pathways. In platelets and a subpopulation of T cells, CD154 is stored and rapidly translocates to the cell membrane following cellular activation (3.Hermann A. Rauch B.H. Braun M. Schrör K. Weber A.A.

In addition to membrane-bound CD154 (mCD154), soluble CD154 (sCD154), which originates from a matrix metalloproteinase-dependent proteolytic cleavage of mCD154, has been found at high levels in several inflammatory conditions (5.Menchén L.

Both mCD154 and sCD154 are found to be as a homotrimers (8.Hsu Y.M. Lucci J. Su L. Ehrenfels B. Garber E. Thomas D. Heteromultimeric complexes of CD40 ligand are present on the cell surface of human T lymphocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 911-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and such property is an absolute requirement for its biological activity. For almost 2 decades, CD40 was considered the sole receptor for CD154 (1.van Kooten C. Banchereau J. Functional role of CD40 and its ligand.Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1997; 113: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). CD40 is a type I transmembrane protein and a member of the TNF receptor superfamily. It is expressed on the surface of many immune and nonimmune cells, including B-lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, platelets, epithelial cells, as well as endothelial cells (2.Schönbeck U. Libby P. The CD40/CD154 receptor/ligand dyad.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Noelle R.J.

CD40 and its ligand in autoimmunity.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 815: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Most biological functions of CD154 have been attributed to its direct interaction with CD40. However, studies using CD154−/− and CD40−/− mice have suggested that CD154 may also bind other receptors (11.Mehlhop P.D. van de Rijn M. Brewer J.P. Kisselgof A.B. Geha R.S. Oettgen H.C. Martin T.R. CD40L, but not CD40, is required for allergen-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness in mice.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, it has been demonstrated that sCD154 interacts with αIIbβ3 (GPIIb/IIIa), an integrin expressed on the megakaryocyte-platelet lineage, mast cells, and hematopoietic progenitor cells (12.André P. Prasad K.S. Denis C.V. He M. Papalia J.M. Hynes R.O. Phillips D.R. Wagner D.D. CD40L stabilizes arterial thrombi by an α3 integrin-dependent mechanism.Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). CD154−/− mice exhibit increased bleeding times and unstable thrombi, thus highlighting the physiological relevance of the CD154/αIIbβ3 interaction (12.André P. Prasad K.S. Denis C.V. He M.

Based on the above observations, and on earlier studies showing that CD154 induces CD40-independent cytokine production in human monocytes (13.Ribbens C. Dayer J.M. Chizzolini C. CD40-CD40 ligand (CD154) engagement is required but may not be sufficient for human T helper 1 cell induction of interleukin-2- or interleukin-15-driven, contact-dependent, interleukin-1β production by monocytes.Immunology. 2000; 99: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14.Lindmark E.

In support of our hypothesis, we reported that sCD154 binds to CD40-negative human monocytic U937 cells, a binding that is mediated by the α5β1 integrin (15.Léveillé C. Bouillon M. Guo W. Bolduc J.

Binding of sCD154 to α5β1 induced translocation of α5β1 to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction in U937 cells (CD40−, α5β1+), as well as rapid activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and IL-8 gene expression (15.Léveillé C.

Additionally, the leukocyte αMβ2 integrin (also named Mac-1) has also been identified as a receptor for CD154 (16.Zirlik A. Maier C. Gerdes N. MacFarlane L. Soosairajah J. Bavendiek U. Ahrens I.

This integrin was found to be implicated in atherosclerosis development via its role in leukocyte adhesion to the endothelial layer and their subsequent trans-endothelial migration (18.Sotiriou S.N. Orlova V.V. Al-Fakhri N. Ihanus E. Economopoulou M. Isermann B. Bdeir K. Nawroth P.P. Preissner K.T. Gahmberg C.G. Koschinsky M.L. Chavakis T. Lipoprotein(a) in atherosclerotic plaques recruits inflammatory cells through interaction with Mac-1 integrin.FASEB J. 2006; 20: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results clearly indicate that CD154 interacts with four different receptors (CD40, αIIbβ3, α5β1, and αMβ2) of biological relevance. Although the three newly described receptors (αIIbβ3, α5β1, and αMβ2) all belong to the integrin superfamily, CD154 binds to each of them in a specific manner. CD154 binds to the active and inactive forms of αIIbβ3 (12.André P. Prasad K.S. Denis C.V. He M. Papalia J.M. Hynes R.O. Phillips D.R. Wagner D.D. CD40L stabilizes arterial thrombi by an α3 integrin-dependent mechanism.Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), whereas its binding to αMβ2 is mainly mediated by the active form of the integrin (16.Zirlik A. Maier C. Gerdes N. MacFarlane L. Soosairajah J. Bavendiek U. Ahrens I. Ernst S. Bassler N. Missiou A. Patko Z. Aikawa M. Schönbeck U. Bode C. Libby P. Peter K. CD40 ligand mediates inflammation independently of CD40 by interaction with Mac-1.Circulation. 2007; 115: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Activation of α5β1, which increases its ability to interact with fibronectin, completely abolished CD154 binding (15.Léveillé C. Bouillon M. Guo W. Bolduc J. Sharif-Askari E. El-Fakhry Y. Reyes-Moreno C. Lapointe R. Merhi Y. Wilkins J.A. Mourad W. CD40 ligand binds to α5β1 integrin and triggers cell signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5143-5151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this investigation, we present data showing the affinity of CD154 to α5β1 and demonstrate that CD154 residues involved in its interaction with α5β1 are distinct from those implicated in its interaction with CD40 and αIIbβ3. According to the topological location of the residues involved in sCD154 binding to CD40 and αIIbβ3, these findings may indicate that sCD154 simultaneously binds different receptors (CD40, α5β1, and/or αIIbβ3). Simultaneous interaction of CD154 with CD40 and α5β1 on CD40-transfected U937 cells generates a cross-talk between these receptors and induces rapid p38 and ERK1/2 activation, which lead to enhanced MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion. The myelomonocytic cell line U937 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and the B cell lymphoma cell line BJAB (from Dr. J. Menezes, Sainte-Justine Hospital, Montréal, Quebec, Canada) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (Wisent, St-Bruno, Quebec, Canada). The pMTBip/V5-His-(A) vector was purchased from Invitrogen. pMTBip/V5-His-(A)-sCD154 wild type (sCD154WT) was generated by subcloning sCD154WT at BglII and XhoI sites within the pMTBip/V5-His-(A) vector. Prior to cloning, the 450-bp sequence encoding the soluble form of wild type CD154 (Met-113 to Leu-261) was first amplified by PCR from pSecTag2A/CD154, using sCD154 primers (Table 1) containing a BglII and XhoI restriction site, respectively. The cDNA encoding mutants of sCD154 (D117E, R203A, Y145A, and R203A/Y145A (R/Y)) were generated by PCR overlap extension methods using the primers described in Table 1. The PCR product was then cloned in pMTBip/V5-His-(A) at BglII and XhoI.

To produce recombinant soluble CD154 (rsCD154) containing different point mutations, cells were co-transfected with pMT-BiP/V5–6× HisA carrying the sCD154 DNA sequence and pCoHygro vectors (Invitrogen) at a weight ratio of 19:1, respectively, by calcium phosphate. The clones were then selected by 300 μg/ml hygromycin B (Wisent Inc., St-Bruno, Quebec, Canada). The expression of rsCD154 was tested by seeding 1–2 × 106 cells in a 100-mm Petri dish followed by induction with 100 mm copper sulfate for 24 h. Cell debris was removed, and Western blot analysis of the generated supernatant was performed. A stable population of hygromycin-resistant S2 cells was obtained after a 20-day period. The selected cultures were initiated to a large scale-up in serum-free medium (Drosophila-SFM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with antibiotics and antimycotic without hygromycin B. Upon induction, the proteins released in the supernatant were recovered by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20 min. The samples were then filtered through a 0.22-μm filter and concentrated to one-twentieth of the initial volume with a Centricon concentrator. The hexahistidine tag within the recombinant sCD154 protein was used for purification with the HisTrap-FF column (GE Healthcare). Purity of all recombinants, CD154 mutants as well as recombinants obtained from commercial sources, was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining. Anti-CD154 hybridoma 5C8 (IgG2a) and anti-CD40 hybridoma G28.5 (IgG1) antibodies were obtained from ATCC. The isotype controls anti-TSST-1 hybridoma 2H8 (IgG1) and anti-SEB hybridoma 8C12 (IgG2a) antibodies were developed in our laboratory. The following antibodies (Abs) 3The abbreviation used is:Abantibody. were purchased: goat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) Ab (Sigma); rabbit anti-phospho-p38 Abs, anti-p38 Abs, rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-ERK1/2, and JBS5 anti-α5β1 Abs (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA); and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP Ab and goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Soluble α5β1 and αIIbβ3 were produced as described previously (19.Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. Get a ligand, get a life. Integrins, signaling, and cell survival.J.

Recombinant soluble CD40-Fc was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Avidin was procured from Sigma, and the Alexa Fluor-488 labeling kit came from Molecular Probes (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Alexa Fluor-488 labeling of rsCD154 (rsCD154-A) and avidin (Avidin-A) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. antibody. The affinity and kinetic analyses of the interactions between rsCD154 and α5β1 and between rsCD154 and αIIbβ3 were determined at 25 °C using the surface plasmon resonance detections with a BIAcore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare). Briefly, rsCD154 was immobilized (∼980 response units) onto a CM4 sensor chip (GE Healthcare), as described for other systems (21.Li H. Zhao Y. Guo Y. Li Z. Eisele L. Mourad W. Zinc induces dimerization of the class II major histocompatibility complex molecule that leads to cooperative binding to a superantigen.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5991-6000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The concentrations used for the injected analyte samples are α5β1 (0.63 μm to 80 nm) and αIIbβ3 (0.18 μm to 23 nm), with 2-fold dilutions. Association and dissociation rates (Kon/Koff), as well as the dissociation constant (KD), were obtained by global fitting of the surface plasmon resonance data from multiple concentrations to a simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model, using the BIAevaluation software Version 4.1. Cell surface analysis was performed with specific mAbs or Alexa-labeled rsCD154-A, as described previously (22.Léveillé C. Chandad F. Al-Daccak R. Mourad W. CD40 associates with the MHC class II molecules on human B cells.Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3516-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Washed cells were then analyzed on a FACSort. For competition binding assay, cells (2 × 105 cells/100 ml) were incubated in binding assay medium (RPMI 1640, HEPES 10 mm, bovine serum albumin (BSA 1%)) containing 20 ng of labeled rsCD154-A or Alexa-labeled avidin-A in the presence or absence of a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled rsCD154, sCD40-Fc, α5β1, or αIIbβ3 for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator (5% CO2 atmosphere). Washed cells were analyzed on a FACSort (BD Biosciences). For binding analysis, cells were incubated with sCD154 (CD154WT, CD154 D117E, CD154 R203A, CD154 Y145A, or and CD154 R203A/Y145A) in staining medium for 30 min at 4 °C for BJAB cells and at 37 °C for U937 cells. Washed cells were then incubated with biotinylated anti-CD154 poly-Ab for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Sigma) for 30 min. Sample were then washed and analyzed on a FACSort. U937 and BJAB cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 4 h at 37 °C and stimulated with rsCD154WT or mutants at different concentrations (15–500 ng/5 × 105 cells/ml) for 1, 2, 5, or 10 min at 37 °C. The stimulation was stopped by the addition of heated/warmed 2× SDS sample buffer containing 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and a mixture of protease (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) inhibitors. After boiling for 7 min, cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk in Tris saline, pH 7.5, 0.15% Tween 20 (Fisher) for 1 h at room temperature. The phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 was assessed by immunoblotting using phospho-specific Abs according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were stripped (62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 30 min, 50 °C) and reprobed with antibodies recognizing total p38 or ERK1/2. Antigen-antibody complexes were revealed by ECL (GE Healthcare). U937 cells (106 cells/ml) were stimulated with 100 or 500 ng/ml of anti-CD40 mAb G28.5, anti-α5β1 mAb JBS5, or with both mAbs in RPMI serum-free medium at 37 °C for 48 h. The presence of MMP-2 and -9 was assessed by gelatin zymography (23.Abou-Saleh H. Théorêt J.F. Yacoub D. Merhi Y. Neutrophil P-selectin-glycoprotein-ligand-1 binding to platelet P-selectin enhances metalloproteinase 2 secretion and platelet-neutrophil aggregation.Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 94: 1230-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, 45 μl of the different supernatants were analyzed at 4 °C on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 2 mg/ml gelatin (Sigma). Gels were then washed twice for 15 min with 2.5% Triton X-100 wash buffer to extract SDS and allow gelatinases to re-nature within the gel. Thereafter, the gel was incubated overnight in enzyme assay buffer (38 mm Trizma hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 13 mm CaCl2 anhydride, 0.05% NaN3) at 37 °C to allow development of enzyme activity bands. Following incubation, gels were washed and stained with 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue (methanol/acetic acid/water, 4:1:6) for 1 h on a shaker at room temperature. Gels were then destained in 40% methanol with 10% acetic acid until detection of gelatinase activity, appearing as clear bands against a dark background. Finally, the gel was scanned, and the density of the bands was measured (Bio-Rad GS-800 and QuantityOne Analysis Software). The ability of a ligand to bind several receptors is not unique for CD154, as it has been reported for various cytokines (24.Groppe J. Hinck C.S. Samavarchi-Tehrani P. Zubieta C. Schuermann J.P. Taylor A.B. Schwarz P.M. Wrana J.L. Hinck A.P. Cooperative assembly of TGF-β superfamily signaling complexes is mediated by two disparate mechanisms and distinct modes of receptor binding.Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 157-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and different cell surface molecules such as CD28/CTLA4:B7.1/B7.2 (25.Greenwald R.J. Freeman G.J. Sharpe A.H. The B7 family revisited.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 515-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar), BAFF/APRIL:BAFF-R/BCMA/TACI (26.Bossen C. Schneider P. BAFF, APRIL and their receptors: structure, function, and signaling.Semin. Immunol. 2006; 18: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and PD-1:PD-L1/PD-L2 (27.Keir M.E. Butte M.J. Freeman G.J. Sharpe A.H. PD-1 and its ligands in tolerance and immunity.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 677-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3783) Google Scholar). Although CD28 and CTLA-4 bind to the same receptors, B7.1 and B7.2, CTLA-4 shows a higher affinity to B7.1 and B7.2 receptors than does CD28. The binding affinity of CD154 to its receptors and the nature of this interaction are not well known. To determine the binding affinity of CD154/receptors, we used the surface plasma resonance approach by immobilizing soluble purified CD154 and injecting increasing concentrations of soluble α5β1 and αIIbβ3. We found that the binding affinity of CD154 for αIIbβ3 (3.07 × 10−8 m) is ∼4-fold higher than for α5β1 (1.19 × 10−7 m) (Fig. 1). To verify the possible concomitant binding of sCD154 to two receptors and determine the nature of the interaction of CD154 with various receptors, we first investigated the ability of soluble CD40-Fc, α5β1, or αIIbβ3 to modulate the binding of sCD154 to CD40 or α5β1 expressed on the cell surface. For this purpose, BJAB cells (a B cell line expressing only CD40) and U937 cells (a monocytic cell line expressing only α5β1) were used as models. Soluble CD154-Alexa was added to BJAB or U937 cells alone or in the presence of unlabeled sCD154, sCD40-Fc, α5β1, or αIIbβ3. Purity of these recombinant proteins was also determined by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2, middle blots). After incubation, washed cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Our results indicate that the binding of sCD154-Alexa to BJAB cells was only inhibited by sCD40-Fc (94.6 ± 2.1% inhibition, Fig. 2, A and C). In contrast, binding of sCD154-Alexa to U937 cells was unaffected by sCD40-Fc (11.1 ± 2.7% inhibition) but significantly blocked by α5β1 (85.9 ± 1.5% inhibition) and, to a lesser extent, by αIIbβ3 (69.2 ± 3.1% inhibition) (Fig. 2, B and C). Competition analysis in the presence of unlabeled sCD154 (10-fold molar excess) was also assessed to show binding specificity of sCD154-Alexa (Fig. 2, A and B, top panels). As expected, binding to both BJAB and U937 cells was completely block by unlabeled CD154 (94.6 ± 2.1% inhibition and 91.2 ± 3.6% inhibition, respectively). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that sCD154 may concomitantly bind CD40 and α5β1 or CD40 and αIIbβ3. Hence, it is highly likely that the residues involved in its interaction with CD40 are different from those implicated in its interaction with α5β1 and αIIbβ3. The CD154 residues involved in CD40 binding have been initially studied by site-directed mutagenesis (28.Bajorath J.

Kim Y.J. Song D.H. Park B.S. Kim H.M. Lee J.D. Paik S.G. Lee J.O. Lee H. Crystallographic and mutational analysis of the CD40-CD154 complex and its implications for receptor activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 11226-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, with respect to the CD154/αIIbβ3 interaction, structural analysis has only been analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis (12.André P. Prasad K.S. Denis C.V. He M. Papalia J.M. Hynes R.O. Phillips D.R. Wagner D.D. CD40L stabilizes arterial thrombi by an α3 integrin-dependent mechanism.Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). According to these analysis, CD154 residues involved in CD40 binding are centered on at least two clusters of residues (Lys-143, Lys-145, Lys-146 and Arg-203, Gln-220) (28.Bajorath J.

Prasad K.S. Denis C.V. He M. Papalia J.M. Hynes R.O. Phillips D.R. Wagner D.D. CD40L stabilizes arterial thrombi by an α3 integrin-dependent mechanism.Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Residue Asp-117 seems to play a major role in the CD154/αIIbβ3 interaction, because substitution of Asp-117 by alanine or glutamic acid abolishes the interaction (12.André P. Prasad K.S. Denis C.V. He M. Papalia J.M. Hynes R.O. Phillips D.R. Wagner D.D. CD40L stabilizes arterial thrombi by an α3 integrin-dependent mechanism.Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The RGD and KGD motifs of α5β1 do not appear to mediate CD154 binding, because activation of α5β1 with Mn2+ or DTT abolished binding (15.Léveillé C. Bouillon M. Guo W. Bolduc J. Sharif-Askari E. El-Fakhry Y. Reyes-Moreno C. Lapointe R. Merhi Y. Wilkins J.A. Mourad W. CD40 ligand binds to α5β1 integrin and triggers cell signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5143-5151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of αIIbβ3 to inhibit the binding of sCD154-Alexa to α5β1 on U937 cells, as observed in the above experiments, might be due to hindrance and/or binding competition for shared residues between both receptors. To verify these hypotheses and to investigate whether CD154 residues involved in CD40 or αIIbβ3 binding are distinct from those involved in binding to α5β1, recombinant sCD154 mutants have been generated, purified, and used for binding and functional analysis. These CD154 mutants include the following: 1) D117A or D117E, which l"
https://openalex.org/W2020142741,"Maintenance by the kidney of stable plasma K(+) values is crucial, as plasma K(+) controls muscle and nerve activity. Since renal K(+) excretion is regulated by the circadian clock, we aimed to identify the ion transporters involved in this process. In control mice, the renal mRNA expression of H,K-ATPase type 2 (HKA2) is 25% higher during rest compared to the activity period. Conversely, under dietary K(+) restriction, HKA2 expression is ∼40% higher during the activity period. This reversal suggests that HKA2 contributes to the circadian regulation of K(+) homeostasis. Compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates, HKA2-null mice fed a normal diet have 2-fold higher K(+) renal excretion during rest. Under K(+) restriction, their urinary K(+) loss is 40% higher during the activity period. This inability to excrete K(+) ""on time"" is reflected in plasma K(+) values, which vary by 12% between activity and rest periods in HKA2-null mice but remain stable in WT mice. Analysis of the circadian expression of HKA2 regulators suggests that Nrf2, but not progesterone, contributes to its rhythmicity. Therefore, HKA2 acts to maintain the circadian rhythm of urinary K(+) excretion and preserve stable plasma K(+) values throughout the day."

Using a real-time phagocytosis assay, we studied the effect of serum proteins on this phagocytic process. Inclusion of 1–5% serum completely abolished phagocytosis of non-opsonized YG beads by human monocytes. Inhibition was reversed by pretreatment of serum with 1–10 mm tetraethylenepentamine, a copper/zinc chelator. Inhibitory proteins from the serum were determined as negatively charged glycoproteins (pI < 6) with molecular masses between 100 and 300 kDa. A glycoprotein-rich inhibitory fraction of serum not only abolished YG bead uptake but also inhibited phagocytosis of apoptotic lymphocytes or neuronal cells by human monocyte-derived macrophages. Three copper- and/or zinc-containing serum glycoproteins, ceruloplasmin, serum amyloid P-component, and amyloid precursor protein, were identified, and the purified proteins were shown to inhibit the phagocytosis of beads by monocytes as well as phagocytosis of apoptotic neuronal cells by macrophages. Human adult cerebrospinal fluid, which contains very little glycoprotein, had no inhibitory effect on phagocytosis of either beads or apoptotic cells.

These data suggest for the first time that metal-interacting glycoproteins present within serum are able to inhibit the scavenger activity of mononuclear phagocytes toward insoluble debris and apoptotic cells. Human monocytes suspended in saline media without serum have long been known to rapidly phagocytose a range of foreign particles, although this process has been less studied than phagocytosis in the presence of serum opsonins (1.Cline M.J. Lehrer R.I. Phagocytosis by human monocytes.Blood. 1968; 32: 423-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This innate phagocytic function requires recognition of the foreign particle by one or more scavenger receptors on the phagocyte surface and is not confined to particulate matter but extends to the “silent” and rapid removal of apoptotic or aged cells in the absence of inflammation (2.Ravichandran K.S. “Recruitment signals” from apoptotic cells. Invitation to a quiet meal.Cell. 2003; 113: 817-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The search for scavenger receptors responsible for the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells has focused on molecules that recognize and bind phosphatidylserine on its surface of apoptotic cells (3.Ravichandran K.S. Lorenz U. Engulfment of apoptotic cells. Signals for a good meal.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 964-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). At least three transmembrane receptors have been predominantly identified as phosphatidylserine receptors and shown to be important for the binding and engulfment of apoptotic cells by macrophages. These include T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing molecules (Tim-1 and Tim-4) (a family of Type-1 single transmembrane proteins) (4.Wong K. Valdez P.A. Tan C. Yeh S. Hongo J.A.

Through serum fractionation, we identify ceruloplasmin (CP), serum amyloid P-component (SAP), and amyloid precursor protein (APP) as prominent glycoproteins each of which inhibits bead phagocytosis including that mediated by P2X7 receptors. Concentrations of these glycoproteins are minimal in CSF, and accordingly human CSF had no effect on engulfment of beads or apoptotic cells by monocytes or macrophages. Without the presence of these inhibitors in CSF, the scavenger activity of receptors such as P2X7 would be unimpeded in the removal of apoptotic cells and insoluble debris from the central nervous system.

Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque, washed once in RPMI 1640 medium, and resuspended in HEPES-buffered NaCl medium (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaOH, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), plus 5 mm glucose, 0.1% BSA, and 0.1 mm CaCl2). The human monocytic cell line THP-1 was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 5 μg/ml gentamycin. The THP-1 were stimulated into a macrophage-like cell by incubating with 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate at a 0.5 × 106/ml count for 24 h according to the previously described method (15.Humphreys B.D. Dubyak G.R. Modulation of P2X7 nucleotide receptor expression by pro- and anti-inflammatory stimuli in THP-1 monocytes.J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 64: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The study was approved by Human Research Ethics Committee of Sydney West Area Health Service (06/058) and Eastern Health of Melbourne (E05/1011). Informed consent was provided according to the Declaration of Helsinki. PBMC (4 × 106/ml) or THP-1 (2 × 106/ml) cells were resuspended in 1.0 ml of NaCl medium with 0.1 mm CaCl2. All samples were stirred, and temperature was controlled at 37 °C using a Time Zero module (Cytek Development Inc.). 5 μl of YG beads were added, and cells were analyzed at ∼1500 events/s on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) that gated the cells by forward and side scatter as well as by cell-type-specific antibodies. The linear mean channel of fluorescence intensity for each gated subpopulation over successive 10-s intervals was analyzed by WinMDI software (by Joseph Trotter, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) and plotted against time. The area under YG bead uptake curve in the first 6.5 min was calculated as the phagocytosis index using a function within Excel (Microsoft). Human serum or heparin anti-coagulated plasma from normal subjects was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (25∼40% saturation) to deplete immunoglobulin, and the supernatant was further precipitated by 40∼60% ammonium sulfate saturation. The latter pellet was dissolved in water and dialyzed over 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) before the dialysate was loaded onto a Capto Q column (150 ml) and eluted with a NaCl gradient from 0 to 1.0 m to remove cationic charged proteins (pI > 7). Proteins eluting at higher NaCl fractions inhibited bead uptake by monocytes, and these were pooled and run through a HiTrap Protein A column (5 ml) and a HiTrap Protein G column (5 ml) to remove remaining immunoglobulin. Immunoglobulin-free samples were then loaded onto a Con A-Sepharose 4B column (100 ml), and glycoproteins were separated on a gradient of 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 0.5 m NaCl (pH 7.0) to 0.1 m borate buffer (pH 6.5). The glycoprotein-rich fractions that inhibited bead uptake were dialyzed overnight against 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) before running through a HiTrap Heparin column (5 ml) and eluted with a NaCl gradient from 0 to 1.0 m. Eluted fractions were pooled, added to 1.4 m ammonium sulfate (pH 7.0), and run through a HiScreen butyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column (4.7 ml), and samples were collected in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing an ammonium sulfate gradient from 1.4 to 0 m. Fractions of interest were pooled, dialyzed against PBS, and concentrated as the serum extract. The minimum concentration of the serum extract at which bead uptake by monocytes was completely blocked was used to study its effect on phagocytosis of apoptotic cells as well as live and heat-killed bacteria. The serum extract (1.0 ml) was then loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (120 ml, 1.6 mm diameter) and eluted at 0.1 ml/min in PBS. The inhibitory effect of each fraction (0.5 ml) on YG beads uptake was measured. Most of the chromatography work was performed on an AKTA Primer Plus instrument. The whole procedure was repeated three times with reproducible results. Proteins from chromatographic fractions (30 μl each) were separated on 4–20% PAGE (Bis-Tris, Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against CP (1:1000), SAP (1:1000, clone 6E6), and the N-terminal APP (1:2000, clone 22C11, in house). Proteins were visualized with ECL (Amersham Biosciences) or SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce) using a LAS-3000 Imaging suite and analyzed using Multi Gauge (Fuji). Purification of CP was performed according to a method described previously (16.Calabrese L. Carbonaro M. Musci G. Chicken ceruloplasmin. Evidence in support of a trinuclear cluster involving type 2 and 3 copper centers.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6480-6483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 ml of Sepharose 2B was sequentially treated with 25 ml epichlorohydrine in 5 n NaOH and 140 ml of chloroethylamine in 10 n NaOH at 70 °C for 2 h each. Human serum (200 ml) was diluted 1:5 with 20 mm 6-amino-n-hexanoic acid (pH 7.4), filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane, and loaded to the derived Sepharose 2B column. After extensive washing with phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at increasing concentrations, CP was eluted with 300 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The eluate was dialyzed against Hepes-buffered saline and concentrated. Purification of SAP was performed with minor modifications to a previously described method (17.Urbanyi Z. Medzihradszky D. Rapid method to isolate serum amyloid P component from human plasma. Characterization of the isolated protein.J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Appl. 1992; 578: 130-133Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, human heparin-anticoagulated plasma (500 ml) was fractionated with saturated ammonium sulfate, and the 40∼65% fraction was collected and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris (pH 7.0). The solution was precipitated twice at 4 °C overnight after the addition of 100 mm CaCl2 each time. The filtered (0.22 μm) supernatant was loaded onto a Sepharose 2B column (200 ml) equilibrated with the loading buffer (0.1 m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 m CaCl2 (pH 7.8)). The SAP was eluted with elution buffer (0.1 m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 4 mm EDTA (pH 7.8)). The eluate was dialyzed against Hepes-buffered saline and concentrated. The recombinant fragments of the human soluble APP isoforms APP695α, APP751α, and APP770α were expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris strain GS115 and purified as previously described (18.Henry A. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cappai R. Expression of human amyloid precursor protein ectodomains in Pichia pastoris. Analysis of culture conditions, purification, and characterization.Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 10: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using anion exchange on a Q-Sepharose column (1.6 × 25 cm column) followed by hydrophobic exchange with phenyl-Sepharose (0.5 × 5 cm column) using an AKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare). The protein was dialyzed against Hepes-buffered saline and concentrated at 4.0 mg/ml containing 10 μm CuCl2. The deglycosylated APP695α was obtained using the Glycofree Chemical Deglycosylation kit (Prozyme, Hayward, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. PBMC (2.0 × 107/ml in 150 μl) were pretreated with various conditions and then incubated with 20 μg of Alexa 488-conjugated heat-killed S. aureus or E. coli (Invitrogen, 2 mg/ml) for 20 or 40 min, respectively, followed by fixation with an equal volume of 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Equal volume of 20 mm filtered sodium acetate buffer containing 1% trypan blue (pH 4.5) was added 30 s before the samples were analyzed by a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometry in settings gated for a monocyte population. S. aureus (live clinical standard) was cultured in LB broth until the A690 reached 0.9. The culture was continued for another 2 h after the addition of 40 μm carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE). The bacteria were washed 3 times with PBS in a 1-h period and resuspended to ∼2 mg protein/ml (equal to heat killed Alexa 488-conjugated S. aureus). Human PBMC (2 × 107/ml in 160 μl of sodium medium) were incubated with CFSE-labeled live S. aureus for 60 min followed by the addition of 100 μl of 0.25% trypsin in PBS with 1 mm EDTA for a further 2-min incubation. Cells were vigorously stirred and fixed with equal volume of 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Human mononuclear cells were isolated from 400 ml of peripheral blood by centrifugation over Ficoll. The monocytes were further separated from lymphocytes by plastic adhesion and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% FCS and 100 units/ml interferon-γ for 5 days followed by labeling with 10 μm CMTMR for 2 h. Cells were washed once and resuspended in complete medium with interferon-γ overnight. Macrophages were then washed twice with Na+ medium and treated with various reagents or fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. The lymphocytes were kept in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% FCS or autologous serum before labeling with 5 μm CFSE for 2 h. Cells were washed once and incubated in complete medium with 1.0 μm staurosporine overnight. Viable lymphocytes were then separated by centrifugation over Ficoll and washed twice with Na+ medium. The proportion of apoptotic cells was assayed using annexin V and 7-AAD dual staining (data not shown). Apoptotic autologous lymphocytes (60∼85% in total cell population) suspension was added into pretreated adherent macrophages with a target cell/phagocyte ratio of 5:1. The cell mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with gentle shaking, and cells were collected by trypsin/EDTA digestion. Samples were vortexed thoroughly and fixed at 4 °C before analysis by flow cytometry. The peptide binding assay was performed as previously described (9.Gu B.J. Saunders B.M. Petrou S. Wiley J.S. P2X(7) is a scavenger receptor for apoptotic cells in the absence of its ligand, extracellular ATP.J. Immunol. 2011; 187: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Short biotin-labeled peptides identical to the P2X7extracellular domain sequence were used to bind to the surface of particles, including peptide#5 (EQR LCP EYP TRR TL), #7 (CSS DRG CKK GWM DPQ), #8 (GRC VVH EGN QKT C), and #22 (KRT LIK VFG IRF DIL) for apoptotic cells, peptides #22 and #23 (KFD IIQ LVV YIG STL) for live E. coli and S. aureus, and peptides #6 (PTR RTL CSS DRG C) and #22 for 3-μm beads. YG beads (3 μm size, 5 μl), live S. aureus or E. coli (10 μl, A690 = 0.9), and staurosporine (0.5 μm)-pretreated human lymphocytes (5 × 106/ml, 200 μl) were incubated with mixed peptides (5 μg/ml each) in the presence or absence of 10% human serum, 0.5 mg/ml glycoprotein extract, 200 μg/ml purified CP, 200 μg/ml APP695, or 100 μg/ml SAP for 15 min followed by two washes. Beads and bacteria were incubated with 100 μl of HRP-labeled streptavidin (1:2000) for 15 min. After two washes, 500 μl of SuperSignal West Pico was added, and the chemiluminescence was measured by a Glo 20/20 luminometer (Promega). Apoptotic cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated streptavidin, allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated annexin V, and 7-AAD (5 μg/ml) for 30 min. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry on gated annexin V+:7-AAD−/+ population. The serum proteins in selected fractions after size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE in non-reduced conditions. The gel was stained overnight with Colloidal Coomassie as described previously (19.Brymora A. Valova V.A. Robinson P.J. Protein-protein interactions identified by pull-down Experiments and mass spectrometry.Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2004; (Chapter 17. Unit 17.5)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein bands of interest were cut, destained, and tryptic-digested before analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectroscopy. For one-dimensional-electrospray ionization, the resulting digested peptides were separated by nano-LC using a CapLC system (Agilent 1100 Series, Agilent Technologies). The LC eluent was subjected to positive ion nanoflow electrospray analysis on an Applied Biosystems QSTAR XL mass spectrometer. The peak list of the peptides was submitted to the data base search program, Mascot (Matrix Science Ltd, London UK), against Homo sapiens in the SwissProt data base. Standard phagocytic assays are generally of several hours duration during which serum can opsonize particles and promote phagocytosis mediated by Fc and complement receptors (20.Olds J.W. Reed W.P. Eberle B. Kisch A.L. Corticosteroids, serum, and phagocytosis. In vitro in vivo studies.Infect. Immun. 1974; 9: 524-529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have developed a time-resolved flow cytometry method based on previous publications (21.Schroeder F. Kinden D.A. Measurement of phagocytosis using fluorescent latex beads.J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1983; 8: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22.Steinkamp J.A. Wilson J.S. Saunders G.C. Stewart C.C. Phagocytosis. Flow cytometric quantitation with fluorescent microspheres.Science. 1982; 215: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) to examine the effect of serum on phagocytosis over a short time course (<10 min). Fluorescent YG 1.0-μm beads were added to monocyte preparations, and the uptake of beads by the gated CD14+ monocytes was followed over 6–7 min at 37 °C with stirring (8.Gu B.J. Saunders B.M. Jursik C. Wiley J.S. The P2X7-nonmuscle myosin membrane complex regulates phagocytosis of nonopsonized particles and bacteria by a pathway attenuated by extracellular ATP.Blood. 2010; 115: 1621-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Engulfment of beads by monocytes was observed at a linear rate, whereas cell surface adhesion of beads to monocytes did not significantly contribute to the value of bead uptake as the addition of CytD, an inhibitor of phagocytosis, reduced uptake by >90% (Fig. 1a). This flow cytometric method gave the surprising result that serum was a potent inhibitor of phagocytosis of non-opsonized beads by human monocytes and was more potent than the classic phagocytosis inhibitor CytD (Fig. 1a). Autologous human serum (1–5%) or 56 °C heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (2–5%) almost completely inhibited the phagocytosis of fluorescent latex beads by fresh peripheral blood monocytes from >40 healthy subjects. 5% serum from other mammalian species, including sheep, rabbit, rat, and mouse showed a similar inhibitory effect (data not shown). Transfection of HEK-293 cells with wild type P2X7 conferred phagocytosis ability on this epithelial cell line as described in our previous study (8.Gu B.J. Saunders B.M. Jursik C. Wiley J.S. The P2X7-nonmuscle myosin membrane complex regulates phagocytosis of nonopsonized particles and bacteria by a pathway attenuated by extracellular ATP.Blood. 2010; 115: 1621-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, phagocytosis of non-opsonized YG beads by these P2X7-transfected cells was almost completely inhibited by 2% whole serum or serum prefiltered through 300-kDa membrane (Fig. 1b). In contrast, serum had no inhibitory effect on phagocytosis by monocytes of beads precoated with IgG or serum (Fig. 1c). Pretreatment of serum with 1–10 mm TEPA (a high affinity copper and zinc chelator) for 1–3 days at 4 °C completely neutralized the inhibitory effect of serum (Fig. 1d). EDTA also neutralized the inhibitory effect of serum, although to a lesser extent than TEPA (data not shown). These data show that serum inhibits scavenger-mediated uptake of beads (including that mediated by P2X7) and suggest that divalent cations may be involved in this inhibitory effect. The inhibitory effect of serum was unaltered by storage at 4 °C or heating serum at 56 °C for 30 min. To characterize the inhibitory component, serum was filtered through ultrafiltration tubes, allowing passage of proteins of size 3, 10, 30, 50, 100, and 300 kDa. Only the filtrate from the 300-kDa filter inhibited phagocytosis of YG beads by monocytes or P2X7-transfected HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1b). Therefore, the inhibitory effect was unlikely to be due to free divalent cations in serum; rather, it was due to proteins with molecular masses around or >100 kDa and <300 kDa. To examine the inhibitory effect of large serum proteins (>300 kDa), a serum lipoprotein fraction was prepared. Serum density was adjusted to 1.019, 1.063, 1.125, and 1.210 g/liter with NaBr, and sera were centrifuged at 38,000 rpm with a T70 rotor for 24 h. The upper lipoprotein-rich fractions at all four densities had little or no inhibitory effect on phagocytosis of beads. The lower lipoprotein-poor fractions showed significant inhibitory effects, suggesting that the inhibitory protein was not a lipoprotein (data not shown). We found that the inhibitory fraction of serum was able to bind the anion exchange column Capto Q but not the cation exchange column Capto S at pH 7.0, indicating that the pI of serum inhibitory protein was below 6.0. We fractionated serum by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation and subsequent chromatography with Capto Q anion exchange, removal of immunoglobulin (protein A and protein G affinity column), Con A affinity binding, heparin affinity binding, and finally butyl hydrophobic polishing (supplemental Fig. S1). Glycoprotein-rich fractions after the butyl column completely inhibited phagocytosis of latex beads and apoptotic human lymphocytes by autologous macrophages as well as S. aureus (live and heat-killed) and E. coli (heat-killed) by human monocytes (Fig. 2). Inhibition by glycoprotein fractions was comparable with CytD (Fig. 2). Preincubation of monocytes or macrophages with extracellular ATP (0.5 mm) inhibited phagocytosis of beads or bacteria, which we have previously reported as a feature of P2X7-mediated phagocytosis (8.Gu B.J. Saunders B.M. Jursik C. Wiley J.S.

Immunol. 2011; 187: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The inhibitory glycoprotein-rich fractions extracted from serum were further fractionated by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200). Proteins in each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE, and eluted bands with maximum anti-phagocytic activity were analyzed by mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. S2). CP was among the proteins identified with a high score of matching peptides (Table 1). The presence of CP in the inhibitory gel filtered glycoprotein fractions was confirmed by Western blotting assay (Fig. 3a). Full-length CP is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 151 kDa and pI of 4.4; however, smaller sized fragments were invariably present. Even with extensive degradation after multiple column runs, inhibition of phagocytosis was maintained in fractions containing the lower molecular mass forms of CP (120, 110, 75, and 60 kDa). Both commercial CP (Sigma) and CP purified from serum by a one-step method (16.Calabrese L. Carbonaro M. Musci G. Chicken ceruloplasmin."
https://openalex.org/W2118995481,"Fluid and electrolyte homeostasis is integral to blood pressure regulation. However, the central molecular mechanisms regulating the neural control of sodium excretion remain unclear. We have demonstrated that brain Gαi2-subunit protein pathways mediate the natriuretic response to α2-adrenoreceptor activation in vivo. Consequently, we examined the role of brain Gαi2 proteins in the neural mechanisms facilitating fluid and electrolyte homeostasis in response to acute [i.v. volume expansion (VE)] or chronic stressful stimuli (dietary sodium restriction vs. supplementation) in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats. Selective oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN)-mediated down-regulation of brain Gαi2 proteins, but not a scrambled ODN, abolished the renal sympathoinhibitory response and attenuated the natriuresis to VE. In scrambled ODN-treated rats, chronic changes in dietary sodium intake evoked an endogenous, hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN)-specific, decrease (sodium deficiency) or increase (sodium excess) in PVN Gαi2 proteins; plasma norepinephrine levels were inversely related to dietary sodium content. Finally, in rats treated with an ODN to prevent high salt-induced up-regulation of brain Gαi2 proteins, animals exhibited sodium retention, global sympathoexcitation, and elevated blood pressure. Collectively, these data demonstrate that PVN Gαi2 protein pathways play an endogenous role in maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance by controlling the influence the sympathetic nervous system has on the renal handling of sodium.—Kapusta, D.

https://openalex.org/W2137843727,"A novel endodextranase from Paenibacillus sp. (Paenibacillus sp. dextranase; PsDex) was found to mainly produce isomaltotetraose and small amounts of cycloisomaltooligosaccharides (CIs) with a degree of polymerization of 7-14 from dextran. The 1,696-amino acid sequence belonging to the glycosyl hydrolase family 66 (GH-66) has a long insertion (632 residues; Thr(451)-Val(1082)), a portion of which shares identity (35% at Ala(39)-Ser(1304) of PsDex) with Pro(32)-Ala(755) of CI glucanotransferase (CITase), a GH-66 enzyme that catalyzes the formation of CIs from dextran. This homologous sequence (Val(837)-Met(932) for PsDex and Tyr(404)-Tyr(492) for CITase), similar to carbohydrate-binding module 35, was not found in other endodextranases (Dexs) devoid of CITase activity. These results support the classification of GH-66 enzymes into three types: (i) Dex showing only dextranolytic activity, (ii) Dex catalyzing hydrolysis with low cyclization activity, and (iii) CITase showing CI-forming activity with low dextranolytic activity. The fact that a C-terminal truncated enzyme (having Ala(39)-Ser(1304)) has 50% wild-type PsDex activity indicates that the C-terminal 392 residues are not involved in hydrolysis. GH-66 enzymes possess four conserved acidic residues (Asp(189), Asp(340), Glu(412), and Asp(1254) of PsDex) of catalytic candidates. Their amide mutants decreased activity (1⁄1,500 to 1⁄40,000 times), and D1254N had 36% activity. A chemical rescue approach was applied to D189A, D340G, and E412Q using α-isomaltotetraosyl fluoride with NaN(3). D340G or E412Q formed a β- or α-isomaltotetraosyl azide, respectively, strongly indicating Asp(340) and Glu(412) as a nucleophile and acid/base catalyst, respectively. Interestingly, D189A synthesized small sized dextran from α-isomaltotetraosyl fluoride in the presence of NaN(3)."

https://openalex.org/W2154457675,"Genetically engineered mice have been generated to model cerebral β-amyloidosis, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology, based on the overexpression of a mutated cDNA of the amyloid-β precursor protein (AβPP) or by knock-in of the murine Aβpp gene alone or with presenilin1 mutations. Here we describe the generation and initial characterization of a new mouse line based on the presence of 2 copies of the human genomic region encoding the wild-type AβPP and the L166P presenilin 1 mutation. At ∼6 mo of age, double-mutant mice develop amyloid pathology, with signs of neuritic dystrophy, intracellular Aβ accumulation, and glial inflammation, an increase in AβPP C-terminal fragments, and an 8 times increase in Aβ42 levels with a 40% decrease in Aβ40 levels, leading to a significant increase (14 times) of Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios, with minimal effects on presenilin or the Notch1 pathway in the brain. We conclude that in mice, neither mutations in AβPP nor overexpression of an AβPP isoform are a prerequisite for Aβ pathology. This model will allow the study of AD pathogenesis and testing of therapeutic strategies in a more relevant environment without experimental artifacts due to the overexpression of a single-mutant AβPP isoform using exogenous promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2024850198,"Mitosis begins with the tethering of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle and their orientation perpendicular to the axis of cell division. In budding yeast, mitotic spindle orientation and the subsequent chromosome segregation are two independent processes. Early spindle orientation is driven by the actin-bound myosin Myo2p, which interacts with the adapter Kar9p. The latter also binds to microtubule-associated Bim1p, thereby connecting both types of cytoskeleton. This study focuses on the interaction between Kar9p and Bim1p and its regulation. We solved the crystal structure of the previously reported Kar9p-binding motif of Bim1p and identified a second, novel Kar9p interaction domain. We further show that two independent post-translational modification events regulate their interaction. Whereas Kar9p sumoylation is required for efficient complex formation with Bim1p, Aurora B/Ipl1p-dependent phosphorylation of Bim1p down-regulates their interaction. The observed effects of these modifications allow us to propose a novel regulatory framework for the assembly and disassembly of the early spindle orientation complex.

During mitosis, chromosomes associate with kinetochore microtubules and are subsequently segregated. Before segregation can occur, the spindle has to be oriented correctly in the cell to ensure equal distribution of the chromosomes between mother and daughter cells. In budding yeast, proper alignment of the mitotic spindle prior to anaphase relies on a myosin-dependent transport event along actin filaments (1.Yin H. Pruyne D. Huffaker T.C. Bretscher A.

For spindle alignment in pre-anaphase, the highly conserved type V myosin motor Myo2p interacts with the adapter Kar9p (karyogamy 9 protein), which itself binds to the microtubule-associated Bim1p (binding to microtubules 1 protein) (1.Yin H.

The CH domain is highly conserved and mediates binding to microtubules (10.Hayashi I. Ikura M. Crystal structure of the amino-terminal microtubule-binding domain of end-binding protein 1 (EB1).J.

The linker region between the CH and EB1-like domains contains no structurally defined domain. In yeast, this linker region of Bim1p is the target of cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation by Aurora B/Ipl1p and supports the microtubule binding of the CH domain (16.Zimniak T. Stengl K. Mechtler K. Westermann S. Phosphoregulation of the budding yeast EB1 homolog Bim1p by Aurora/Ipl1p.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Also human EB1 interacts with Aurora B kinase (17.Sun L. Gao J. Dong X. Liu M. Li D. Shi X. Dong J.T. Lu X. Liu C. Zhou J.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7153-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting conservation of this post-translational modification. Because APC is a very large protein (4.Nishisho I. Nakamura Y. Miyoshi Y. Miki Y. Ando H. Horii A. Koyama K. Utsunomiya J. Baba S. Hedge P. Mutations of chromosome 5q21 genes in FAP and colorectal cancer patients.Science. 1991; 253: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar), only few details are available that explain its molecular function during the cell cycle. In contrast, for its shorter yeast homolog Kar9p, the interaction partners and modifying enzymes have been identified. Kar9p is subject to sumoylation (18.Leisner C. Kammerer D. Denoth A. Britschi M.

Yeast Cdk1 translocates to the plus-end of cytoplasmic microtubules to regulate bud cortex interactions.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although both types of modification are regulated independently, mutations in Kar9p affecting either of them result in impaired spindle orientation (18.Leisner C. Kammerer D. Denoth A. Britschi M.

Biol. 2008; 18: 1249-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To date, it is unclear why these modifications are important. Here, we provide a mechanistic explanation for how post-translational modifications in Kar9p and Bim1p contribute to the regulation of their functions. We found that unmodified Kar9p fails to bind to Bim1p, whereas Kar9p from yeast extracts efficiently binds to recombinant Bim1p. Pulldown assays with yeast strains expressing Kar9p with mutated sumoylation sites showed severely reduced Bim1p binding. Thus, Kar9p sumoylation is likely required for the efficient assembly of the spindle orientation complex. We solved the crystal structure of the C-terminal EB1-like domain of Bim1p and generated structure-based mutations that either abolished or increased the interaction with Kar9p. Furthermore, we identified a novel Kar9p interaction region in Bim1p. This region is subject to cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation by the Aurora B kinase, which we found to down-regulate Bim1p binding to Kar9p. General yeast methods were performed as described (21.Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Detailed information on strains and plasmids is provided in supplemental Tables S2–S4. Deletion mutants were obtained by a PCR-based knock-out method (24.Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W.

Epitope tagging of yeast genes using a PCR-based strategy: more tags and improved practical routines.Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) and verified by PCR. Mutations of BIM1 and KAR9 were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. For pulldown experiments, cells were plated on synthetic-complete (SC)-His plates and grown in YPD (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose) at 30 °C until the mid-logarithmic phase. For Kar9p overexpression, cells were grown in YPR (yeast extract/peptone/raffinose) to A600 = 1 and induced with 2% galactose for 3–4 h at 30 °C. For pulldown experiments with His-tagged Smt3p, cells were plated on synthetic complete (SC)-Ura plates and grown in synthetic complete (SC)-Ura and raffinose as described for Kar9p overexpression. GST-tagged Bim1p fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli and isolated to high purity using standard chromatographic techniques (25.Heuck A. Fetka I. Brewer D.N. Hüls D. Munson M. Jansen R.P.

Protein quantities were calculated from their absorbance at 280 nm and individual molar extinction coefficients. Purified Bim1p and Kar9p were stable over days. Crystals were grown at 21 °C by hanging-drop vapor diffusion using a 1:1 mixture of protein (2 mg/ml) and crystallization solution containing 0.1 m BisTris (pH 8.0), 20% PEG 5000 MME, 40% γ-butyrolactone, and 10 mm potassium tetranitroplatinate(II) for heavy atom-soaked crystals. Crystals appeared within 1–2 days. Maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tagged Bim1p was expressed in E. coli, affinity-purified via an amylose resin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and eluted with 10 mm maltose. Purification was finished by chromatography on a Superose 12 column (GE Healthcare) (27.Graebsch A. Roche S. Niessing D. X-ray structure of Pur-α reveals a Whirly-like fold and an unusual nucleic acid-binding surface.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Single anomalous dispersion experiments and native data sets were recorded at beamline ID-29 (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France). The data were integrated and scaled using XDS (28.Kabsch W. Automatic processing of rotation diffraction data from crystals of initially unknown symmetry and cell constants.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3225) Google Scholar). Phases were obtained with SHELX (29.Sheldrick G.M. A short history of SHELX.Acta Crystallogr. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (80464) Google Scholar). The model was built manually from the platinum data set using Coot (30.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23183) Google Scholar). The native protein structure was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (31.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J.

Sequence alignments were performed with the programs Clustal (European Bioinformatics Institute) and visualized with Jalview. The surface plot of sequence conservation was generated with Chimera (33.Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. UCSF Chimera–a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis.J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27832) Google Scholar). Structure superposition and representation were performed with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific), and root mean square deviation calculation with LSQMAN (Uppsala Software Factory). Electrostatic surface calculation was done with CCP4mg (34.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19744) Google Scholar). Buried surface areas were calculated using AREAIMOL (34.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19744) Google Scholar). Yeast cells from log-phase cultures were vortexed with glass beads (4 × 3 min) in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mm DTT). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (13,200 rpm, 20 min) and used for pulldown experiments. Equimolar amounts of proteins were incubated with constant amounts of yeast extracts and 50 μl of amylose resin for 20 min in lysis buffer, followed by five wash steps with 1 ml of lysis buffer and elution with 35 μl of elution buffer (lysis buffer and 10 mm maltose). One-third of the elution volume was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody. For quantification, Western blots of three independent experiments were analyzed using the LAS-3000 minisystem and Multi Gauge software (FUJIFILM). Background signals from MBP lanes were subtracted from respective Western blot signals. Subsequently, individual Bim1p-MBP signals were normalized with the signal of MBP alone. Signals of coprecipitated Kar9p were compared with each other. We solved the crystal structure of the EB1 motif of Bim1p (Bim1p(C-term), amino acids 182–282) (supplemental Fig. S1) at 2.45 Å resolution (Table 1). The structure reveals a dimer, in which each monomer consists of a long and a short α-helix (Fig. 1A). The loop region connecting both helices contains a Bim1p-specific sequence insertion (red boxed sequence in supplemental Fig. S1), which was not visible in the electron density and thus is likely disordered. A kink in the lower third of the long helix induces asymmetry that is responsible for a root mean square deviation between both monomers of 1.60 Å. The hydrophobic dimerization interface involves a large buried surface of 1987 Å2, suggesting stable dimerization in solution (supplemental Table S1).TABLE 1Crystallographic data collection and refinement statisticsData setNativePt peakData collectionX-ray source (ESRF)ID-29ID-29Space groupP21P21Cell symmetrya = 28.00, b = 42.5, c = 100.5 Å; α = γ = 90, β = 90.3°a = 28.00, b = 44.25, c = 101.25 Å; α = γ = 90, β = 94.7°Wavelength (Å)1.2541.071Data range (Å)20–2.4550–2.1Observations (unique)31,883 (8832)90,864 (30,751)I/σI (last shell)13.12 (2.07)8.16 (1.71)Completeness (%) (last shell)98.8 (98.3)99.0 (63.8)Rsym (last shell)aRsym is the unweighted R-value on I between symmetry mates.7.8 (71.7)14.2 (98.5)RefinementRwork (Rfree)bRwork = Σhkl‖Fo(hkl)| − |Fc(hkl)‖/Σhkl|o(hkl)| for reflections in the working data set.,cRfree = cross validation R-factor for 5% of reflections against which the model was not refined.0.211 (0.240)r.m.s.d.0.0098Bond lengths (Å)Bond angles1.18°Ramachandran plot (%)Allowed97.0Additionally allowed1.8Outliers1.2a Rsym is the unweighted R-value on I between symmetry mates.b Rwork = Σhkl‖Fo(hkl)| − |Fc(hkl)‖/Σhkl|o(hkl)| for reflections in the working data set.c Rfree = cross validation R-factor for 5% of reflections against which the model was not refined. Open table in a new tab An overlay of the structures of Bim1p and human EB1 (Protein Data Bank code 1WU9) showed that they adopt a similar overall fold (root mean square deviation of 1.2 Å) (supplemental Fig. S2A). However, the large helix of Bim1p is about one-third longer than that in EB1 (total length of ∼93 versus ∼63 Å). The EB1 motif of Bim1p contains few regions of pronounced surface charges (Fig. 1B). The plot of a sequence alignment (supplemental Fig. S1) onto the surface of the structure shows a region in the center of the dimer with high conservation (Fig. 1C). This conserved surface contains two regions with rather small hydrophobic patches. For EB1, these regions have been shown to mediate binding to cargo (12.Slep K.C. Rogers S.L. Elliott S.L. Ohkura H. Kolodziej P.A. Vale R.D. Structural determinants for EB1-mediated recruitment of APC and spectraplakins to the microtubule plus-end.J.

An EB1-binding motif acts as a microtubule tip localization signal.Cell. 2009; 138: 366-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Molecular weight analyses from small-angle x-ray scattering experiments revealed that Bim1p(C-term) and full-length Bim1p (Bim1p(FL)) also form dimers in solution (Fig. 1D). An overlay of the experimental scattering curve of Bim1p(C-term) with the calculated scattering curve from the crystal structure shows an almost perfect match (supplemental Fig. S2B). Thus, the dimer of the crystal structure is likely physiologic. Together, these results suggest that the EB1 motif mediates dimerization of Bim1p(FL). Because full-length human EB1 is also dimeric (36.Buey R.M. Mohan R. Leslie K. Walzthoeni T. Missimer J.H. Menzel A. Bjelic S. Bargsten K. Grigoriev I. Smal I. Meijering E. Aebersold R. Akhmanova A. Steinmetz M.O. Insights into EB1 structure and the role of its C-terminal domain for discriminating microtubule tips from the lattice.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 2912-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), this seems to be a general feature of this protein class. To assess complex formation between Bim1p and Kar9p, we performed pulldown experiments with both proteins recombinantly expressed in E. coli. Surprisingly, no direct interaction was observed. However, when we performed these experiments with recombinant Bim1p and extracts of Myc-Kar9p-expressing yeast cells, we clearly detected Kar9p in Western blots (Fig. 1E). These data suggest that post-translational modifications in Kar9p or cofactors are required for their interaction. The observation that Bim1p(FL) bound more efficiently to Kar9p than Bim1p(C-term) further indicates that regions outside the EB1 motif of Bim1p might contribute to the complex formation with Kar9p. To determine whether the yeast-specific loop region of 24 amino acids is important for complex formation with Kar9p, we generated Bim1p mutants with deletions of 12 or 14 amino acids in the loop (Bim1pΔ12 or Bim1pΔ14). Pulldown experiments with these recombinantly expressed mutants showed normal interactions with Kar9p (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the loop is dispensable for this function. We used our structure and previously reported mutations in EB1 to generate point-mutated versions of Bim1p(FL) and performed pulldown experiments with extracts from Myc-Kar9p-expressing cells, followed by Western blotting. Among the 15 mutant Bim1p(FL) proteins that were soluble, we found mutations R217A, F219A, Y220A, F221A, E228A, and H232A to impair Kar9p binding (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, the Bim1p mutations E214A, E218A, and N222A enhanced Kar9p binding. Pulldown experiments with a subset of mutations in Bim1p(C-term) followed by quantitative analyses of Western blots revealed consistent results, with the exception of mutations I227A and R225A (Fig. 2, C–E). When plotting the interaction-modulating mutations onto the surface of the Bim1p(C-term) structure, a patch within the highly conserved hydrophobic core is observed (compare supplemental Fig. S2, C and D, with Fig. 1C). We also compared these residues with the amino acids identified in EB1 to influence cargo binding (12.Slep K.C. Rogers S.L. Elliott S.L. Ohkura H. Kolodziej P.A. Vale R.D. Structural determinants for EB1-mediated recruitment of APC and spectraplakins to the microtubule plus-end.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 13.Honnappa S.

An EB1-binding motif acts as a microtubule tip localization signal.Cell. 2009; 138: 366-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Several of the corresponding residues in both proteins are identical, and others lie in close vicinity (supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that their overall mode of interaction is similar. However, human EB1 failed in pulldown assays to interact with Myc-Kar9p from yeast extracts (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, both proteins seem to bind in a somewhat different manner. Next, we tested selected Bim1p mutants in otherwise BIM1 deletion strains by challenging them with increasing concentrations of the microtubule-depolymerizing fungicide benomyl or at increased temperatures. Similar to a previous report (6.Schwartz K. Richards K. Botstein D. BIM1 encodes a microtubule-binding protein in yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), the experimental readout for both assays was colony growth on agar plates. Although we did not observe growth defects at 37 °C with any of the tested bim1 mutants, sensitivity to treatment with benomyl was increased in a yeast strain expressing the Bim1p(F219A) mutant (Fig. 2E and supplemental Fig. S4A). In our pulldown assays, this mutation had almost completely lost its interaction with Kar9p (Fig. 2, C–E). Mutations without defects in pulldown experiments also failed to show effects in both in vivo assays. Interestingly, the Bim1p(I229A) mutant, which yielded a normal Kar9p interaction in pulldown assays (Fig. 2, C and E) displayed a lower benomyl sensitivity compared with wild-type Bim1p (Fig. 2E and supplemental Fig. S4A). The fact that not all mutations with reduced Kar9p binding yield growth defects suggests that complex assembly might be more robust in vivo. It is also consistent with the presence of a second, partially redundant Kar9p-binding site in Bim1p. Indeed, the better binding of Bim1p(FL) compared with Bim1p(C-term) (Fig. 1E) suggests a contribution of regions outside the EB1 motif to Kar9p interaction. On the other hand, deletion of the EB1 motif or larger C-terminal fragments resulted in a loss of Kar9p binding (Fig. 3, A and B), arguing against a second binding region. Because deletion of the EB1 motif is likely to abolish dimerization of Bim1p, we also tested the possibility that this feature is required for a potential second binding site. We replaced the EB1 motif with the dimerization-mediating coiled-coil region of GCN4 (Fig. 3A) and tested these mutants in pulldown experiments. Indeed, we could pull down Myc-Kar9p with a protein consisting of Bim1p amino acids 1–187 fused to GCN4 (Bim1p(1–187)-GCN4) (Fig. 3, A and B). This interaction became weaker when parts of the Bim1p linker region were deleted (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that a region between the CH domain and the EB1 motif mediates binding to Kar9p and that this function requires Bim1p dimerization. A rescue experiment with Bim1p(1–187)-GCN4 in the Δbim1 background only slightly alleviated growth defects (supplemental Fig. S4B), which is consistent with the observation that either Bim1p(1–187)-GCN4 or the EB1 motif alone binds to Kar9p significantly less efficiently compared with Bim1p(FL) (Fig. 1E and Fig. 3, A and B). The novel Kar9p-binding region between the CH domain and EB1 motif is phosphorylated during anaphase at six serines (positions 139, 148, 149, 165, 166, and 176) by the Aurora B kinase Ipl1p (Fig. 3A) (16.Zimniak T. Stengl K. Mechtler K. Westermann S. Phosphoregulation of the budding yeast EB1 homolog Bim1p by Aurora/Ipl1p.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and is required for proper spindle mid-zone disassembly. Mutations of these serines to glutamic acids efficiently mimic phosphorylation of Bim1p (16.Zimniak T. Stengl K. Mechtler K. Westermann S. Phosphoregulation of the budding yeast EB1 homolog Bim1p by Aurora/Ipl1p.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We tested whether phosphorylation of Bim1p affects its association with Kar9p by performing pulldown experiments with phosphomimetic mutants in the linker region of Bim1p. Indeed, a strongly reduced interaction was observed with the double mutant Bim1p(FL;S165D/S166D) (Fig. 3C). With Bim1p(FL;S139D) and Bim1p(FL;S176D), a more moderate reduction of Kar9p association was observed. These data indicate that Aurora B/Ipl1p-dependent phosphorylation of Bim1p might regulate the binding to Kar9p via the Bim1p linker region. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that Aurora B/Ipl1p kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Bim1p is required for normal progression of mitosis (16.Zimniak T. Stengl K. Mechtler K. Westermann S. Phosphoregulation of the budding yeast EB1 homolog Bim1p by Aurora/Ipl1p.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Kar9p is sumoylated at Lys-301, Lys-333, Lys-381, and Lys-529 (18.Leisner C. Kammerer D. Denoth A. Britschi M. Barral Y. Liakopoulos D. Regulation of mitotic spindle asymmetry by SUMO and the spindle assembly checkpoint in yeast.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1249-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A yeast strain expressing a Kar9p version with all four sumoylation sites mutated fails to accumulate Kar9p asymmetrically on the mother-directed spindle pole body and emanating astral microtubules (18.Leisner C. Kammerer D. Denoth A. Britschi M. Barral Y. Liakopoulos D. Regulation of mitotic spindle asymmetry by SUMO and the spindle assembly checkpoint in yeast.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1249-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because sumoylation is hardly detectable in G1 phase but is well established during metaphase, this modification was proposed to have a positive effect on the function of Kar9p during mitosis (18.Leisner C. Kammerer D. Denoth A. Britschi M. Barral Y. Liakopoulos D. Regulation of mitotic spindle asymmetry by SUMO and the spindle assembly checkpoint in yeast.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1249-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of Kar9p sumoylation on its interaction with Bim1p by generating yeast strains with point mutations in sumoylation sites of Kar9p (Fig. 4A). These Myc-Kar9p mutants were tested in pulldown experiments for an interaction with recombinant MBP-Bim1p. We observed an almost complete loss of Bim1p(FL) binding when all four sumoylation sites were mutated (Kar9p(4R)) and more moderate defects when only two or three sites were mutated (Kar9p(2R), K301R/K381R; and Kar9p(3R), K301R/K381R/K529R) (Fig. 4B). With the exception of K381R, defects in Bim1p association upon mutation of individual sumoylation sites in Kar9p were more moderate compared with those upon multiple mutations. Pulldown experiments with His-tagged Smt3p followed by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody revealed that Myc-Kar9p was indeed sumoylated in our extracts and that this modification was reduced upon mutation of multiple sumoylation sites (supplemental Fig. S5B). Thus, sumoylation at K381R and perhaps at additional sites of Kar9p seems to be required for efficient complex formation with Bim1p. To study the importance of individual Kar9p sumoylation sites in vivo, we overexpressed sumoylation mutant versions of Kar9p under the control of a GAL1 promoter in a KAR9 deletion background and tested them for benomyl and temperature sensitivity. Already, the overexpression of wild-type Kar9p resulted in considerable growth defects (Fig. 4C; compare supplemental Fig. S5 with supplemental Fig. S4A). We reasoned that less active Kar9p mutants might produce weaker dominant-negative effects, offering a simple approach to unambiguously assess defects in Kar9p function. Indeed, the observed growth defects of strains with single Kar9p mutations correlated well with the defects in the pulldown experiments (Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. S5). Whereas Kar9p(2R) showed growth defects with similar strength as wild-type Kar9p, the Kar9p(3R) and Kar9p(4R) mutants caused significantly smaller growth defects (Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. S5). Leisner et al. (18.Leisner C. Kammerer D. Denoth A. Britschi M. Barral Y. Liakopoulos D. Regulation of mitotic spindle asymmetry by SUMO and the spindle assembly checkpoint in yeast.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1249-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) showed that sumoylation occurs during metaphase and that Kar9p(4R) fails to localize to only one of the spindle pole bodies. It was further shown that the Bim1p-Kar9p complex assembles before loading onto the microtubules via the spindle pole bodies (37.Cuschieri L. Miller R. Vogel J. γ-Tubulin is required for proper recruitment and assembly of Kar9-Bim1 complexes in budding yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have demonstrated that Kar9p sumoylation is important for complex formation with Bim1p. In agreement with the previous studies, our findings therefore suggest that sumoylation induces assembly of the early spindle orientation complex. We should note that our experiments do not rule out the possibility that additional factors may be required for this interaction. Furthermore, Western blotting with anti-Smt3p antibody after Bim1p pulldown experiments suggested additional, previously undetected sumoylation sites in Kar9p. 3D. Hüls, Z. Storchova, and D. Niessing, unpublished data. Their importance remains to be investigated in future studies. Notably, strong defects of mutant proteins in pulldown experiments often translated into much weaker defects in vivo. This suggests either that the dynein-dependent spindle elongation compensates for these defects or that other countervailing mechanisms exist. Phosphorylation of the linker region of Bim1p by the Aurora B/Ipl1p kinase occurs at the beginning of anaphase (16.Zimniak T. Stengl K. Mechtler K. Westermann S. Phosphoregulation of the budding yeast EB1 homolog Bim1p by Aurora/Ipl1p.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This is the time point when spindle orientation is completed and the Myo2p-Kar9p-Bim1p complex has to disassemble. We have shown that phosphomimetic mutations in our newly identified Kar9p interaction site of Bim1p result in reduced complex formation. Therefore, our data suggest a cell cycle-dependent inactivation of the Bim1p-Kar9p interaction by phosphorylation of Bim1p in the linker region. A working model of the cell cycle-dependent assembly and disassembly of the Myo2p-Kar9p-Bim1p complex is given in supplemental Fig. S6. It has recently been reported that binding of human EB1 to Aurora B kinase protects it from inactivation (17.Sun L. Gao J. Dong X. Liu M. Li D. Shi X. Dong J.T. Lu X. Liu C. Zhou J. EB1 promotes Aurora B kinase activity through blocking its inactivation by protein phosphatase 2A.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7153-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this context, it would be interesting to see whether phosphorylated EB1 or Bim1p shows increased binding to Aurora B/Ipl1p kinase, thereby protecting it from inactivation. If true, this feedback loop could constitute a novel entry point for inhibitory approaches.
