https://openalex.org/W2064000861,"The oxyR gene positively regulates genes induced by oxidative stress in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Purification of the OxyR protein showed that oxidized but not reduced OxyR activates transcription of oxidative stress-inducible genes in vitro. Conversion between the two forms of OxyR is rapid and reversible. Both the oxidized and the reduced forms of the OxyR protein are capable of binding to three diverse sequences upstream of OxyR-regulated promoters, but the interactions of the two forms of OxyR with the promoter regions are different. The results suggest that direct oxidation of the OxyR protein brings about a conformational change by which OxyR transduces an oxidative stress signal to RNA polymerase."

https://openalex.org/W2028376572,"I kappa B is an inhibitory protein that stabilizes the inducible cytoplasmic form of the NF-kappa B transcription factor. We have purified I kappa B-alpha, a major form of I kappa B with an apparent molecular size of 37 kd, from cytosol of human placenta. A second chromatographically distinct form, I kappa B-beta, was partially purified and found to be more basic and 3-8 kd larger than the alpha form. The occurrence of distinct forms of I kappa B could explain how NF-kappa B can be activated in response to various agents that signal via different intracellular messenger systems. Both I kappa B-alpha and -beta exclusively inactivated NF-kappa B containing the non-DNA binding 65 kd subunit and, within minutes, could dissociate a high affinity complex of NF-kappa B with its cognate DNA. On the assumption that free I kappa B-alpha and -beta can enter the nucleus, these proteins could rapidly release NF-kappa B from high affinity binding sites in enhancer and promoter elements, thereby terminating NF-kappa B-dependent initiation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2107737466,"Adenylyl cyclase from S. cerevisiae contains at least two subunits, a 200 kd catalytic subunit and a subunit with an apparent molecular size of 70 kd, which we now call CAP (cyclase-associated protein). We cloned a cDNA encoding CAP by screening a yeast cDNA expression library in E. coli with antisera raised against the purified protein. The cDNA contained an open reading frame capable of encoding a 526 amino acid protein that is not homologous to any sequences in the current data bases. Adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes from cells that lacked CAP was not stimulated by RAS2 proteins in vitro. These results suggest that CAP is required for at least some aspects of the RAS-responsive signaling system. Mutants lacking CAP had four additional phenotypes that appear to be unrelated to effects of the RAS/adenylyl cyclase pathway: the inability to grow on rich medium (YPD), temperature sensitivity on minimal medium, sensitivity to nitrogen starvation, and a swollen cell morphology."

https://openalex.org/W2004755394,"The rate of release of guanine nucleotides from the ras proteins (Ras) is extremely slow in the presence of Mg2+. It seemed likely, therefore that a factor might exist to accelerate the release of guanosine diphosphate (GDP), and hence the exchange of GDP for guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Such a factor has now been discovered in rat brain cytosol. Brain cytosol was found to catalyze, by orders of magnitude, the release of guanine nucleotides from recombinant v-H-Ras protein bound with [alpha-32P]GDP. This effect occurred even in the presence of a large excess of Mg2+, but was destroyed by heat or by incubation of the cytosol for an hour at 37 degrees C in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors. The effect was observed with either v-H-Ras or c-H-Ras, but not with p25rab3A, a small G protein with about 30% similarity to Ras. The effect could not be mimicked by addition of recombinant Ras-GAP or purified GEF, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in the regulation of eukaryotic protein synthesis. By gel filtration chromatography, the factor appears to possess a molecular size between 100,000 and 160,000 daltons. This protein (Ras-guanine nucleotide-releasing factor, or Ras-GRF) may be involved in the activation of p21ras."
https://openalex.org/W1550017207,"Of the recently described members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family (-delta, -epsilon, -zeta), no detailed properties of the purified enzymes have been presented. Here we describe the expression of PKC-epsilon in insect cells using a baculovirus vector. The recombinant enzyme has been purified to homogeneity by sequential chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, serine-Sepharose, Mono Q, and Superose 12; the protein shows a molecular mass of 90 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PKC-epsilon is dependent upon phospholipid and diacylglycerol (or phorbol esters) for activity and displays a pattern of specificity for these effectors similar to other PKC isotypes. Similarly, inhibition of PKC-epsilon by staurosporine and H-7 parallels inhibition of other PKC isotypes. However, unlike PKC-alpha, -beta, and -gamma, PKC-epsilon shows no dependence upon Ca2+. Furthermore, the substrate specificity of PKC-epsilon is quite different from other characterized PKCs. The importance of functional diversity within the PKC family is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2050303637,"The product of the c-abl proto-oncogene (c-Abl) is phosphorylated on three sites during interphase and seven additional sites during mitosis. Two interphase and all mitotic c-Abl sites are phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase isolated from either interphase or mitotic cells, with the mitotic cdc2 having an 11-fold higher activity. Inhibition of phosphatases with okadaic acid in interphase cells leads to the phosphorylation of c-Abl mitotic sites, indicating that those sites are preferentially dephosphorylated during interphase. The differential phosphorylation of c-Abl in the cell cycle is therefore determined by an equilibrium between cdc2 kinase and protein phosphatase activities. Treatment of interphase cells with okadaic acid leads to a rounded morphology similar to that observed during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1694722751,"Aminoacyl-tRNA-protein transferases (Arg-transferases) catalyze post-translational conjugation of specific amino acids to the amino termini of acceptor proteins. A function of these enzymes in eukaryotes has been shown to involve the conjugation of destabilizing amino acids to the amino termini of short-lived proteins, these reactions being a part of the N-end rule pathway of protein degradation (Gonda, D. K., Bachmair, A., Wunning, I., Tobias, J. W., Lane, W. S., and Varshavsky, A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 16700-16712). We have cloned the ATE1 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which encodes arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase. ATE1 gives rise to a approximately 1.6-kilobase mRNA and codes for a 503-residue protein. Expression of the yeast ATE1 gene in Escherichia coli, which lacks Arg-transferases, was used to show that the ATE1 protein possesses the Arg-transferase activity. Null ate1 mutants are viable but lack the Arg-transferase activity and are unable to degrade those substrates of the N-end rule pathway that start with residues recognized by the Arg-transferase."
https://openalex.org/W2054858544,"The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) can efficiently couple with mitogenic signaling pathways when it is transfected into interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent 32D hematopoietic cells. When expression vectors for erbB-2, which is structurally related to EGFR, or its truncated counterpart, Î”NerbB-2, were introduced into 32D cells, neither was capable of inducing proliferation. This was despite overexpression and constitutive tyrosine kinase activity of their products at levels associated with potent transformation of fibroblast target cells. Thus, EGFR and erbB-2 couple with distinct mitogenic signaling pathways. The region responsible for the specificity of intracellular signal transduction was localized to a 270-amino acid stretch encompassing their respective tyrosine kinase domains. Thus, tissue- or cell-specific regulation of growth factor receptor signaling can occur at a point after the initial interaction of growth factor with receptor. Such specificity in signal transduction may account for the selection of certain oncogenes in some malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W1561795287,"A granule-associated phospholipase A2 from rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes and a closely similar phospholipase A2 from rabbit serum have been purified to near homogeneity by ion-exchange and reverse-phase chromatography. The cellular (polymorphonuclear leukocyte) phospholipase A2 has been purified greater than 100,000-fold and the extracellular (serum) phospholipase A2 approximately 60,000-fold. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the ascitic fluid phospholipase A2 that we have recently purified from inflammatory exudates produced in rabbits is nearly identical (15 of 16 residues) to that of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte phospholipase A2 and completely identical (19 of 19 residues) to that of the purified serum phospholipase A2. The functional properties of these three phospholipases A2 are indistinguishable. Each enzyme is active against Escherichia coli killed by the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein of polymorphonuclear leukocyte, a property shared only by a subset of phospholipases A2. The presence of structurally and functionally very closely similar phospholipases A2 in the cellular and extracellular compartments of an inflammatory exudate is consistent with the apparent role of these enzymes in the destruction of certain microbial invaders during the acute inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1538957598,"Recently, phospholipase D-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) was shown to be stimulated by activators of protein kinase C (Kiss, Z., and Anderson, W. B. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 1483-1487), suggesting that PtdEtn metabolism may play a role in signal transduction. Here we have studied the possible regulation of PtdEtn hydrolysis by adenine and guanine nucleotides, as well as by sphingosine, both in membranes isolated from [14C]ethanolamine- or [32P]PtdEtn-prelabeled NIH 3T3 cells and in intact cells. In isolated membranes both ATP and ADP stimulated the hydrolysis of PtdEtn. Both nucleotides had maximal (approximately 2-fold) effects at about 0.5 mM concentration. The main water-soluble product of [14C]PtdEtn hydrolysis was [14C]ethanolamine, while in [32P] PtdEtn-prelabeled membranes the nucleotides stimulated the formation of [32P]phosphatidic acid, suggesting the involvement of a phospholipase D-type enzyme. The hydrolysis-resistant analogs of GTP, such as guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, greatly potentiated the stimulatory effects of ATP and ADP on PtdEtn hydrolysis. On the other hand, the nonphosphorylating analogs of ATP, adenyl-5'-yl beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate and beta,gamma-methyl-eneadenosine 5'-triphosphate, failed to stimulate PtdEtn hydrolysis both in the absence and presence of guanosine triphosphates. Sphingosine, while exhibiting no effect alone, had a relatively modest (1.2-1.3-fold) potentiating effect on ATP-stimulated PtdEtn hydrolysis in isolated membranes. The effect of sphingosine was mimicked by threo- and erythrosphinganines, while N-acetylsphingosine was without effect. In studies with [14C]ethanolamine-prelabeled intact NIH 3T3 cells, externally added ATP did not stimulate PtdEtn hydrolysis. In contrast, sphingosine and sphinganines had much greater stimulatory effects on PtdEtn hydrolysis in intact cells than with isolated membranes. These data indicate that PtdEtn hydrolysis may be regulated by adenine and guanine nucleotides in addition to, or in cooperation with, the activators of protein kinase C, and that sphingosine may be an additional regulator of PtdEtn hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1522104226,"Aqualysin I is a subtilisin-type serine protease which is secreted into the culture medium by Thermus aquaticus YT-1, an extremely thermophilic Gram-negative bacterium. The nucleotide sequence of the entire gene for aqualysin I was determined, and the deduced amino acid sequence suggests that aqualysin I is produced as a large precursor, consisting of at least three portions, an NH2-terminal pre-pro-sequence (127 amino acid residues), the protease (281 residues), and a COOH-terminal pro-sequence (105 residues). When the cloned gene was expressed in Escherichia coli cells, aqualysin I was not secreted. However, a precursor of aqualysin I lacking the NH2-terminal pre-pro-sequence (38-kDa protein) accumulated in the membrane fraction. On treatment of the membrane fraction at 65 degrees C, enzymatically active aqualysin I (28-kDa protein) was produced in the soluble fraction. When the active site Ser residue was replaced with Ala, cells expressing the mutant gene accumulated a 48-kDa protein in the outer membrane fraction. The 48-kDa protein lacked the NH2-terminal 14 amino acid residues of the precursor, and heat treatment did not cause any subsequent processing of this precursor. These results indicate that the NH2-terminal signal sequence is cleaved off by a signal peptidase of E. coli, and that the NH2- and COOH-terminal pro-sequences are removed through the proteolytic activity of aqualysin I itself, in that order. These findings indicate a unique four-domain structure for the aqualysin I precursor; the signal sequence, the NH2-terminal pro-sequence, mature aqualysin I, and the COOH-terminal pro-sequence, from the NH2 to the COOH terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1986551332,"The ability of differentiating sensory neurons to remodel a fibronectin substratum was examined. During the early stages of neurite outgrowth, fibronectin was cleared from areas beneath the neuronal soma and processes. The removal of fibronectin occurred in the presence and absence of plasminogen and was associated with the release of fibronectin fragments into the culture medium. The degradation of fibronectin was dependent upon neuronal contact with the substratum. Extraction of cells with the nonionic detergent Triton X-114 identified plasminogen activator and plasmin associated with the cell surface. These findings suggest that the plasminogen activator/plasmin system may play an important role in the interaction of differentiating sensory neurons with the extracellular matrix during axonal outgrowth."

https://openalex.org/W1513278346,"The HEM15 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes ferrochelatase (EC 4.99.1.1, protoheme ferrolyase), a mitochondrial inner membrane-bound enzyme which catalyzes the insertion of ferrous ion into protoporphyrin IX, the last step in protoheme biosynthesis. The gene was isolated by functional complementation of a hem15 mutant. Sequence analysis of a 2.9-kilobase genomic DNA fragment revealed an open reading frame of 1179 nucleotides, plus a gene coding for a tRNA(Val)(GUU) and delta elements downstream from the 3'-end of HEM15. The open reading frame encodes a precursor form of the protein containing a 31-amino acid presequence. The mature enzyme contains 362 amino acid residues; its calculated molecular weight (40,900) and predicted amino-terminal sequence agree with those determined from the purified protein. It is relatively abundant in lysine (9%) and contains no apparent transmembrane segment. Disruption of the HEM15 gene led to non-viable cells in certain genetic background. Northern (RNA) analysis showed a slight (1.5-2-fold) repression of HEM15 expression by glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1556106321,"The addition of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to the major nuclear pore complex glycoprotein p62 was examined. Expression of the rat p62 cDNA in transfected monkey cells was detected using a rat p62-specific antipeptide antiserum and two previously described nuclear pore-specific monoclonal antibodies which require O-linked GlcNAc for binding. Although the p62 cDNA was predicted to encode a 54-kDa polypeptide, the product expressed in monkey cells migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as two species of 62 and 59-kDa. Cell-free translation of the p62 in vitro transcript yielded a 59-kDa polypeptide using wheat germ extract and a 62-kDa product using a commercially available rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Several lines of evidence indicated that the 62-kDa rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation product was modified by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine; the protein bound specifically to a wheat germ agglutinin affinity column and was converted to 59 kDa when treated with jack bean beta-acetylglucosaminidase. The 59-kDa unglycosylated wheat germ translation product was converted to the 62-kDa glycosylated form upon incubation with reticulocyte lysate demonstrating that O-linked GlcNAc can be added to p62 post-translationally."
https://openalex.org/W1967761879,"Oligodendrocytes and type-2 astrocytes develop sequentially from O-2A progenitor cells in the rat CNS. We have reproduced this sequential development in a simplified, serum-free in vitro system: in cultures of newborn optic nerve cells treated with platelet-derived growth factor to maintain O-2A progenitor cell proliferation, progenitor cells differentiate into oligodendrocytes during the first week in vitro and into type-2 astrocytes during the second week. Thus all of the signals needed for type-2 astrocyte development are made by serum-free optic nerve cultures, indicating that neurons are not required. By manipulating the cellular composition of the cultures, we provide evidence that type-2 astrocyte development does not depend on oligodendrocytes, but instead requires non-O-2A lineage cells, which are also responsible for timing this development."
https://openalex.org/W1574708246,"The yeast gene ALG1 encodes a mannosyltransferase which participates in the formation of the lipid-linked precursor oligosaccharide for N-glycosylation by catalyzing the formation of dolichol pyrophosphate (Dol-PP)-GlcNAc2Man from GDP-Man and Dol-PP-Glc-NAc2. The DNA region including the ALG1 gene was sequenced and found to contain an open reading frame of 1347 bases. The predicted ALG1 protein contained 449 amino acids (51.9 kDa) with a hydrophobic region near the amino terminus, suggesting it was an integral membrane protein, and four potential sites for N-glycosylation. Disruption of the ALG1 open reading frame by insertion of the URA3 gene showed that the ALG1 gene was essential for viability. Northern analysis and transcript protection showed that the ALG1 gene was transcribed into two classes of messages which differed by about 100 bases at their 5' end and shared a common 3' end. In actively growing cells the short transcript predominated, but as growth slowed the long transcript was more prevalent. The short transcript was predicted to encode the ALG1 protein while the long transcript was predicted to encode a 74-amino acid protein of unknown function. Disruption of the 74-amino acid reading frame, which ended 42 bases upstream of the potential start codon for the ALG1 protein, showed it was not essential for viability."

https://openalex.org/W1589151888,"The system coordinating expressions of nuclear coded mitochondrial proteins was investigated by examination of the 5'-flanking region of the human mitochondrial ATP synthase beta-subunit gene. The promoter activity was measured by a transient expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene connected with various 5'-deletion mutants of the 5'-flanking region. In this experiment, at least two regions enhanced this promoter activity and at least one region repressed it. In one of the enhancing regions, a consensus sequence was found for the genes of other mitochondrial proteins such as those for cytochrome c1 (Suzuki, H., Hosokawa, Y., Nishikimi, M., and Ozawa, T. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 1368-1374) and the pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha-subunit (Maragos, C., Hutchison, W. M., Hayasaka, K., Brown, G. K., and Dahl, H.-H. M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 12294-12298; Ohta, S., Endo, H., Matsuda, K., and Kagawa, Y. (1989) Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 573, 458-460). The characteristics of this enhancing element were examined by introducing a synthetic oligonucleotide element into the CAT plasmid with a deleted enhancing element. The resulting plasmid showed full recovery of promoter activity, and this activity was independent of the orientation or location of the insert. Therefore, this is an enhancer that may be common to the nuclear genes of some mitochondrial proteins involved in energy transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1501207010,"The recA protein (RecA) promotes DNA pairing and strand exchange optimally in the presence of single-stranded binding protein (SSB). Under these conditions, 3' homologous ends are essential for stable joint molecule formation between linear single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and supercoiled DNA (i.e. 3' ends are 50-60 times more reactive than 5' ends). Linear ssDNAs with homology at the 5' end do not participate in pairing. In the absence of SSB, the strand exchange reaction is less efficient; however, linear ssDNAs with 3' end homology are still 5- to 10-fold more reactive than those with 5' end homology. The preference for a 3' homologous end in the absence of SSB suggests that this is an intrinsic property of RecA-promoted strand exchange. The preferential reactivity of 3' homologous ends is likely to be a consequence of the polarity of polymerization of RecA on ssDNA. Specifically, since RecA polymerizes in the 5'----3' direction, 3' ends are more likely to be coated with RecA and, hence, will be more reactive than 5' ends."
https://openalex.org/W1558542220,"A 3,000-base pair EcoRI fragment containing the Flavobacterium meningosepticum gene for peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase was cloned into the Bluescript plasmid vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene consists of an open reading frame of 1,062 base pairs coding for a 354-amino acid protein; the first 40 amino acids are presumed to be the natural secretory signal sequence, with the remaining 314 amino acids (34,779 Da) representing the catalytically active protein. The deduced amino acid sequence was verified independently by direct microsequencing of over 94% of the pure protein (Flavobacterium peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase) as tryptic and cyanogen bromide peptides. Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase was not secreted by E. coli; molecular weight analysis of the partially purified recombinant enzyme suggested incomplete processing of the putative leader sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2044549469,"Estrogen and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) interact to influence both behavior and gonadotropin release. However, little is known about the biochemical mechanisms that mediate the effects of these hormones or their interactions. The most prominent protein induced by estrogen in the ventromedial hypothalamus has the same amino-terminal sequence as the most prominent protein induced by LH-RH in the pituitary in vitro and in vivo; these proteins comigrate on two-dimensional gels. Furthermore, the hormonal induction may be caused by modification of a constitutive protein with the same molecular weight (70,000) but a slightly more acidic isoelectric point, whose level is inversely related to the level of the induced form after estrogen treatment. Thus estrogen and LH-RH may interact by additively or synergistically inducing this protein, which is called HIP-70."

https://openalex.org/W1540303431,"Nonprotein amino acid furanomycin was found to bind with Escherichia coli isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) almost as tightly as the substrate L-isoleucine. The conformation of furanomycin bound to the enzyme was determined by NMR analyses including the transferred nuclear Overhauser effect method. The conformation of IleRS-bound furanomycin was similar to that of L-isoleucine, although the chemical structure of furanomycin is unlike that of L-isoleucine. By E. coli IleRS, E. coli tRNAIle was charged with furanomycin as efficiently as with L-isoleucine. Furthermore, furanomycyl-tRNAIle was bound to polypeptide chain elongation factor Tu as tightly as isoleucyl-tRNAIle. Furanomycin was found to be incorporated into beta-lactamase precursor by in vitro protein biosynthesis. A newly designed amino acid will probably be incorporated into proteins, provided that the new amino acid takes a similar conformation as a protein-constituting amino acid in the active site of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1571594249,"The peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase F (PNGase F) gene from Flavobacterium meningosepticum was cloned into a high copy number Escherichia coli plasmid. Levels of PNGase F activity produced in cultures of the recombinant strain were up to 100-fold higher than those obtained in cultures of F. meningosepticum. The complete PNGase F gene sequence was determined. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of pre-PNGase F to the N-terminal sequence of the native mature enzyme indicates that the protein is synthesized with a 40-amino acid signal sequence that is removed during secretion in F. meningosepticum. The recombinant PNGase F produced in E. coli is a mixture of products comprised predominantly of two proteins with molecular masses of 36.3 and 36.6 kDa. These proteins have a higher apparent molecular mass than the 34.7-kDa native enzyme. N-terminal amino acid sequencing demonstrated that these higher molecular mass products result from cleavage of the pre-PNGase F in E. coli upstream of the native N terminus. The PNGase F gene was engineered to encode a preenzyme that was processed in E. coli to give an N terminus identical to that of the native enzyme. Purified preparations of this form of recombinant PNGase F were shown to be suitable for glycoprotein analyses since they possess no detectable endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F, exoglycosidase, or protease activity."
https://openalex.org/W1579289786,"The bacteriophage P2 ogr gene product, a 72-residue basic protein rich in cysteine and histidine, is a positive regulatory factor for phage late gene transcription in both P2 and satellite phage P4. We have developed a simple purification procedure for Ogr protein synthesized from an overproducing plasmid. Inclusion bodies formed upon overproduction were denatured using 8 M urea, and the overproduced protein was purified by gel filtration. The purified Ogr was allowed to refold under optimized conditions and was subsequently shown to be able to transactivate the phage P4 late promoter Psid in an in vitro coupled transcription-translation system. Using a 65Zn blotting method and absorption spectroscopy, we show that Ogr is a zinc-binding protein and that the conserved cysteine residues are involved in forming a complex with Zn(II). The purification procedure described allows Ogr to be obtained in both high purity and yield."

Employing the promoter and signal sequence of Staphylococcus aureus-protein A we have expressed hPTH in Escherichia coli. The expressed proteins are excreted to the growth medium, allowing for rapid and easy purification of the desired products. By amino acid sequence analysis and mass spectrometry, we have shown that the major excreted product is correctly processed human identical hPTH(1-84). The purified recombinant hPTH(1-84) stimulates adenylate cyclase activity in rat osteosarcoma cell membranes to exactly the same extent as synthetic parathyroid hormone standards, indicating that the recombinant product has full biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1573694214,"Nascent preproinsulin interacts with endoplasmic reticulum membranes after approximately 70-80 residues of the 116-amino acid precursor are polymerized (Eskridge, E. M., and Shields, D. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11487-11491). To understand the relationship between the size of a nascent presecretory polypeptide and the efficiency of its translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, recombinant DNA molecules were generated that encoded a series of preproinsulin derivatives with the same NH2 terminus as preproinsulin and progressively shorter COOH termini. The DNA was transcribed, the in vitro transcription products were translated in the wheat germ cell-free translation system, and the interaction of the resulting truncated polypeptides with signal recognition particle (SRP) and with microsomal membranes was analyzed. Truncations composed of 78 and 64 amino acids were translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and translocation was found to be strictly co-translational and SRP-dependent. Translocation efficiency at low membrane concentrations was reduced for these truncated molecules relative to full-length preproinsulin. Most significantly, translation of the 64-residue polypeptide was arrested by SRP after only 50 amino acids were polymerized. This suggests that the initial interaction of nascent secretory proteins with SRP occurs when only 10 residues of the signal peptide protrude from the large ribosomal subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1559419458,"A complementary DNA encoding a renin-binding protein (RnBP) has been isolated from a porcine kidney cDNA library by immunological screening of in vitro translation products from the cDNAs. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the clone revealed a 1,342-nucleotide sequence with a 5'-terminal untranslated region of 52 nucleotides, an open reading frame of 1,206 nucleotides that encodes 402 amino acids, and a 3'-terminal untranslated region of 84 nucleotides that contains the polyadenylation signal sequence, AATAAA. The predicted amino acid sequence contains no hydrophobic amino-terminal sequence and does not show significant homology to those of other identified proteins. The in vitro translated RnBP was found to have the same molecular weight, 42,000, as that of the purified RnBP from porcine kidney on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and it formed a complex with renin purified from porcine kidney, which indicates that the cDNA encodes a functional RnBP without a propeptide sequence. The RnBP cDNA probe hybridized to a 1.5-kilobase mRNA in kidney, liver, adrenal, and pituitary glands, the amount being much greater in kidney than in the other tissues. Southern blot analysis showed the presence of a unique gene for RnBP in the porcine genome."
https://openalex.org/W1482423684,"Total intensity light scattering is employed to investigate the self-assembly kinetics of RecA protein. Reaction conditions are employed where the kinetics of self-assembly are slow enough to yield reliable scattered intensity measurements over the range of scattering angles from 40 to 130 degrees as a function of time. From these measurements the time-dependent behavior of the weight average molecular weight, Mr, and radius of gyration, RG, of the associating protein species as a function of [MgCl2], [NaCl], [RecA], and pH was determined. The temperature dependence of RecA self-assembly was also investigated and allowed an evaluation of the activation thermodynamic parameters of association. Results reveal RecA self-assembly is bi-phasic under all conditions examined. The first phase, referred to as is second-order in [RecA] and occurs via a quasi linear condensation scheme with an Arrhenius activation energy of 88.6 kcal/mol. Filamentation assembly involves the uptake of one proton, one MgCl2, the release of five to six NaCls, and is driven by the release of approximately 70 water molecules. The evaluated activation parameters of the first kinetic phase are consistent with the proposition that linear self-assembly of RecA protein into ordered filaments is entropically driven. The second kinetic phase, referred to as bundling is greater than second-order in both [RecA] and [MgCl2], is considerably slower that filamentation assembly, and is apparently initiated by 2nd order collisions of linear filaments."
https://openalex.org/W1529518498,"Mechanism-based inactivation of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent histidine decarboxylase by (S)-alpha-(fluoromethyl)histidine was studied. The molar ratio of inactivator to enzyme subunit required for complete inactivation increased from 1.63 at 10 degrees C to 3.00 at 37 degrees C. Two inactivation products were isolated by chromatographic fractionation of the reaction mixture and identified by NMR spectroscopy as 1-(4-imidazolyl)-3(5'-P-pyridoxylidene) acetone (I), the adduct formed between pyridoxal phosphate and inactivator, and 1-(4-imidazolyl) acetone (II), an intermediate compound formed during inactivation. Formation of these two products supports a previously proposed mechanism of inactivation (Hayashi, H., Tanase, S., and Snell, E. E. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11003-11009), with minor modifications. A precursor of I was linked covalently to the enzyme by NaBH4 reduction if the reaction was carried out immediately after inactivation, before development of the 403 nm peak of I. A mutant histidine decarboxylase (S322A) in which Ser-322 was changed to Ala was also inactivated by alpha-fluoromethylhistidine demonstrating that Ser-322 is not essential for inactivation even though it is close to the active site and is derivatized by borohydride reduction of the inactivated wild-type enzyme. Following inactivation, both the wild-type and the S322A mutant enzyme could be partially reactivated by prolonged dialysis against buffer."
https://openalex.org/W1515639309,"Transverse-plane topography of mitochondrial outer-membrane long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase was investigated using proteases as probes for exposure of crucial domains, i.e. domains containing the active site or otherwise required for enzymatic activity. Incubation of intact mitochondria with the nonspecific proteases proteinase K and subtilisin resulted in a time-dependent loss of 90% or more of the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity compared to control incubations. The integrity of the outer membrane before and during this treatment was shown by cytochrome c oxidase latency as well as the stability of adenylate kinase activity in the presence of protease. After a 15-min incubation in these conditions, site-specific proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin had only a limited inhibitory effect (29 and 58% loss of activity, respectively); however, treatment of hypotonically disrupted mitochondria with these proteases resulted in increased (71 and 77%, respectively) loss of activity. Exposure of trypsin-sensitive crucial domains on the inner surface of the membrane was directly demonstrated by incubation of trypsin-loaded outer-membrane vesicles. Together, these results suggest that mitochondrial long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase is a transmembrane enzyme, possessing crucial domains on both sides of the outer membrane. However, the cytosolic exposure of the enzyme does not appear to be affected by a change in the medium ionic strength as seen previously for other outer-membrane enzymes. In an experiment investigating the topography of the active site of the enzyme, an immobilized substrate analog, desulfo-CoA-agarose, was preincubated with intact mitochondria. This resulted in up to a 42% loss of the activity of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, consistent with a cytosolic exposure for at least the CoA-binding domain of the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1510586165,"Two different approaches enabled us to unambiguously establish the intermediacy of isotrichodermin and 12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene in the biosynthesis of the trichothecenes 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol and sambucinol, respectively. The kinetic pulse-labeling method enabled us to detect a plausible precursor to 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol biosynthesis. Feeding experiments using the pure 14C-labeled intermediate established that it was incorporated 27% into 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol but not to sambucinol. The 14C-precursor was subsequently used as a marker to purify the unlabeled intermediate which was shown to be isotrichodermin by spectroscopic techniques. In order to trace the enriched carbons incorporated into 3-acetylde-oxynivalenol, specifically deuteriated isotrichodermin was synthesized and fed to Fusarium culmorum. The 2H NMR spectrum of the derived 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol proved conclusively the position of the deuteriums and that isotrichodermin is a major biosynthetic precursor. The proof that isotrichodermin is converted in vivo to 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol but not to sambucinol led us to postulate that 12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene might have an important role in the biosynthesis of trichothecenes. We synthesized 12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene with tritium at C-15 or with two deuteriums at C-4 and two deuteriums at C-15. These labeled compounds enabled us to prove that 12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene is a major precursor to sambucinol biosynthesis but is neither converted to isotrichodermin nor to 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol. We also succeeded in isolating a biosynthetic intermediate between 12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene and sambucinol and characterized its structure as 3-deoxysambucinol by spectroscopic techniques (1H NMR, 2H NMR, 13C NMR, correlation spectroscopy, two-dimensional heteronuclear correlation experiments, and mass spectroscopy)."
https://openalex.org/W1491730618,"X-ray structural studies have shown that Arg-179 of thymidylate synthase is complexed to bound inorganic phosphate or to the 5'-phosphate of the bound substrate dUMP. The importance of Arg-179 to the structure/function of thymidylate synthase is also indicated by its complete conservation among the 17 thymidylate synthases thus far sequenced. In the present work, Arg-179 has been replaced by Thr, Ala, Lys, and Glu using site-directed mutagenesis with a mixture of four synthetic oligonucleotides as primers. The mutant proteins complement thymidylate synthase-deficient Escherichia coli and show high enzyme activity. Each of these mutants has been purified to homogeneity, partially sequenced to verify the mutation, and has had its steady state kinetic parameters determined. The most significant effect of all mutations is localized to a decrease in the net rate of association of thymidylate synthase with dUMP; the Lys mutant also shows an apparent increase in the dissociation constant of the folate cofactor of the reaction. The high activity in the mutant enzymes is explained by plasticity of the enzyme and compensatory actions of the other Arg residues. Why the Arg-179 residue has been conserved during evolution remains an open question."

https://openalex.org/W1558564837,"We have examined expression of the protein coded within the MRP 1 locus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Direct evidence is provided for the assignment of the MRP1 gene product as a protein component of the small subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes. Further studies examined the extent to which the expression of the MRP1 protein is coordinated with the expression of other mitochondrial ribosomal components coded in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Extra copies of the MRP1 gene were introduced into yeast cells to perturb expression from MRP1 relative to other mitochondrial ribosomal components to determine whether forms of regulation function to limit the accumulation of either MRP1 mRNA or protein under these conditions. Increases in MRP1 gene dosage were accompanied by substantial increases in both MRP1 mRNA and protein, indicating that their accumulation was not linked to the level of expression of other mitochondrial ribosomal components. This conclusion was confirmed by additional studies that showed that the accumulation of the MRP1 protein was unaffected in cells that did not express mitochondrially-encoded rRNAs. These results contrast with previous studies on the expression of two other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins indicating that regulatory properties of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are quite diverse."
https://openalex.org/W1497242238,"Asp-60 is believed to be a catalytically essential residue of the tryptophan synthetase alpha chain of Escherichia coli (Nagata, S., Hyde, C.C., and Miles, E.W. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6288-6296). Surprisingly, mutations altering Asp-60 were not observed in the many trpA missense mutants characterized in the 1960s. However, there was one genetic class of trpA missense mutants, represented by trpA34, for which protein structure analyses failed to detect an amino acid substitution. DNA sequence analyses have now shown that the trpA34 mutation was in codon 60 and that it resulted in replacement of Asp-60 by Asn. This finding provides additional support for the conclusion that the tryptophan synthetase alpha chain contains only a small number of absolutely essential residues."
https://openalex.org/W1512101112,"The role of methylation in chemotaxis is understood generally, but several anomalies exist which bring into question the timing of methylation relative to sensing. A double mutant bacterium, deficient in both methyltransferase and methylesterase (Tr-Es-) is capable of chemotaxis even though the respective single mutants (Tr- and Es-) are not. This Tr-Es- mutant will accumulate in capillaries containing aspartic acid but not in capillaries containing serine despite the fact that both the aspartate and serine receptors are part of the methylation-dependent pathway. To understand these anomalies, a combination of theoretical analyses and experimental studies was performed. A mathematical analysis of the gradients of aspartate and serine in the capillary assay shows that outside the capillary the gradients are shallow, but just inside the mouth of the capillary they are very steep. Also, when the number of bacteria accumulated in the capillary is at a maximum, the range of attractant concentrations in the steep gradient just inside the mouth of the capillary is optimal for response and partial adaptation by the Tr-Es- mutant. We postulate that random motion brings the Tr-Es- mutant into the capillary, where it is able to move up the steep gradient. The difference in timing of the responses to serine and aspartate explains why the Tr-Es- mutant accumulates in aspartate- but not in serine-containing capillaries. A simple diffusion-capture model incorporating these concepts can account for experimental values of the number of Tr-Es- bacteria accumulating in the capillary. These studies provide a rational explanation for all of the apparent anomalies and lead to the conclusion that methylation/demethylation plays a crucial role in sensing as well as setting the zero point of the receptor."
