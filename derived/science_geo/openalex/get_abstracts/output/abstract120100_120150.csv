https://openalex.org/W2127150495,"We have previously shown that the persistent activation of p42/p44MAPK is required to pass the G1 restriction point in fibroblasts (Pagès, G., Lenormand, P., L'Allemain, G., Chambard, J. C., Meloche, S., and Pouysségur, J. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 8319-8323) and postulated that MAPKs control the activation of G1 cyclin-dependent complexes. We examined the mitogen-dependent induction of cyclin D1 expression, one of the earliest cell cycle-related events to occur during the G0/G1 to S-phase transition, as a potential target of MAPK regulation. Effects exerted either by the p42/p44MAPK or the p38/HOGMAPK cascade on the regulation of cyclin D1 promoter activity or cyclin D1 expression were compared in CCL39 cells, using a co-transfection procedure. We found that inhibition of the p42/p44MAPK signaling by expression of dominant-negative forms of either mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MKK1) or p44MAPK, or by expression of the MAP kinase phosphatase, MKP-1, strongly inhibited expression of a reporter gene driven by the human cyclin D1 promoter as well as the endogenous cyclin D1 protein. Conversely, activation of this signaling pathway by expression of a constitutively active MKK1 mutant dramatically increased cyclin D1 promoter activity and cyclin D1 protein expression, in a growth factor-independent manner. Moreover, the use of a CCL39-derived cell line that stably expresses an inducible chimera of the estrogen receptor fused to a constitutively active Raf-1 mutant (ΔRaf-1:ER) revealed that in absence of growth factors, activation of the Raf > MKK1 > p42/p44MAPK cascade is sufficient to fully induce cyclin D1. In marked contrast, the p38MAPK cascade showed an opposite effect on the regulation of cyclin D1 expression. In cells co-expressing high levels of the p38MAPK kinase (MKK3) together with the p38MAPK, a significant inhibition of mitogen-induced cyclin D1 expression was observed. Furthermore, inhibition of p38MAPK activity with the specific inhibitor, SB203580, enhanced cyclin D1 transcription and protein level. Altogether, these results support the notion that MAPK cascades drive specific cell cycle responses to extracellular stimuli, at least in part, through the modulation of cyclin D1 expression and associated cdk activities. We have previously shown that the persistent activation of p42/p44MAPK is required to pass the G1 restriction point in fibroblasts (Pagès, G., Lenormand, P., L'Allemain, G., Chambard, J.

In eukaryotic cells, three distinct MAPK cascades have been described, which appear to be linked to separate signal transduction pathways resulting in the final activation of either p42/p44MAPK, p38/HOGMAPK, or stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) also called Jun kinases (JNKs) (2Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Depending on the cellular context, extracellular signals are thought to elicit a specific cellular response (proliferation/differentiation/apoptosis) through the preferential activation of one of the MAPK cascades, which have distinct spectra of substrates (3Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). mitogen-activated protein mitogen-activated protein kinase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal calf serum polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis MAP kinase kinase MAP kinase phosphatase interleukin Retinoblastoma protein stress-activated protein kinases extracellular regulated kinase activating transcription factor. In most cell types, the mitogenic signal is relayed from the cytoplasm into the nucleus by the nuclear translocation of the ubiquitously expressed p42/p44MAPK isoforms (also called ERK2 and ERK1 for extracellular regulated kinase) (4Chen R.-H.

In fibroblasts, agents that elicit a short term MAP kinase activation are not mitogenic, whereas potent mitogens that induce DNA synthesis drive long term MAP kinase activation (11Meloche S. Seuwen K. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 845-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that a sustained activation of the p42/p44MAPKs is required for fibroblasts to pass the G1 restriction point and enter S-phase (1Pagès G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.-C. Meloche S. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 12Brondello J.-M. Mckenzie F.R. Sun H. Tonks N.K. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1895-1904PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of the p42/p44MAPK module is sufficient to stimulate early gene transcription and to reduce growth factor requirement for DNA synthesis (13Brunet A. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). Therefore, the p42/p44MAPK cascade is likely to regulate some mid-late changes in gene expression that are rate-limiting events for S-phase entry, during the G1 progression of the cell cycle. In contrast to p42/p44MAPKs, which are strongly activated by growth factors and growth-promoting hormones, JNKs and p38MAPK are poorly sensitive to growth signals, and their activation is preferentially triggered by pro-inflammatory cytokines and environmental stresses (3Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The JNK cascade has been implicated in the modulation of AP-1-regulated gene expression through the phosphorylation of the proto-oncogene c-Jun (3Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 15Westwick J.K. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Cobb M.H. Hibi M. Karin M. Brenner D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar). The two stress-activated signaling pathways can mediate the phosphorylation of the transcription factor ATF2 on residues that increase its transcriptional activity in vivo, suggesting that these two cascades may participate in the regulation of ATF2-dependent gene expression (17Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar, 18Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). Initial reports suggested that the JNK cascade could be required for mitogenesis in fibroblasts (21Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). However, a more recent study indicated that activation of JNK and p38MAPK and concurrent inhibition of p42/p44MAPK promote the ability of nerve growth factor to induce apoptosis in PC12 cells (22Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, JNK and p38MAPK cascades lie on separate signaling pathways and have, in addition to their common substrates, specific cellular targets, i.e. c-Jun and MAPKAPK-2, respectively (23Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 24Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Limazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). These two cascades are thus likely to be involved in the regulation of distinct cellular functions; however, it is not clear what specific role can be attributed to one or the other stress signaling pathways at the level of cell division mechanisms. Transduction of extracellular signals culminates in the expression and assembly of different kinase holoenzymes, the cyclin-cdk (cyclin-dependent kinase) complexes, which are formed and activated at specific stages of the cell division cycle. Although the kinase-associated activity of these complexes is modulated by specific phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events on the catalytic subunits, the temporal activation of the holoenzymes is primarily dependent on the synthesis and accumulation of specific regulatory subunits, the cyclins (25Grana X. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclins D1, D2, and D3, in conjunction with their catalytic partners cdk4 and cdk6, appear to regulate the initial phases of G1 progression (26Jiang W. Kahn S.M. Zhou P. Zhang Y.J. Cacace A.M.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2125-2134PubMed Google Scholar). In normal untransformed cells, the growth factor-dependent accumulation of cyclin D1 has been shown to be required to allow cells to pass the G1 restriction point (27Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A.

A. 1995; 92: 6837-6841Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, cyclin D1 requirement becomes dispensable in a cell background deficient for the tumor suppressor (pRb) function (32Lukas J. Bartkova J. Rohde M. Strauss M. Bartek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2600-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This observation further emphasizes the functional link between pRb and cyclin D1-associated kinase activity, which has been shown to be responsible in part for hyperphosphorylating pRb (33Dowdy S.F. Hinds P.W. Louie K. Reed S.I. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 499-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 34Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M.

Qian Y. Templeton D.J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 395-407PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, early appearance of cyclin D1 upon growth factor stimulation of resting fibroblasts plays a central role in regulating the G0-G1 transition of the cell cycle. Because of the strict requirement for a persistent p42/p44MAPK activation to successfully pass the G1 restriction point, we hypothesized that these MAPKs control cyclin D1-associated kinase activity. We have thus drawn our attention to cyclin D1 as a potential “nuclear sensor” of extracellular signals. Here we report that cyclin D1 expression is positively controlled by the Raf > MKK1 > p42/p44MAPK cascade in the Chinese hamster fibroblast cell line CCL39, whereas the stress-activated p38/HOGMAPK cascade antagonizes this expression. This report that establishes a link between persistent activation of p42/p44MAPKs and cyclin D1 expression provides a key element to the understanding of the temporal action of growth factors.

The selection vector used in transient transfection assays termed pNHE3 contains cDNA encoding the NHE3 cell-specific human Na+/H+ antiporter gene (43Noël J. Roux D. Pouysségur J. J.

The established Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line CCL39 (American Type Culture Collection) and its derivative CCL39-ΔRaf-1:ER cell line that stably expresses the ΔRaf-1:ER chimera 4Lenormand, P., McMahon, M., and Pouysségur, J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 15762-15768. were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (50 µg/ml). Cells were grown in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. Cells were rendered quiescent (G0-arrested) by a 24 h-incubation in serum-free DMEM. CCL39 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method. For the cyclin D1-luciferase expression assays, CCL39 cells were seeded at a density of 150,000 cells per well in 24-well plates and co-transfected with 0.25 µg of the reporter D1Δ-944 together with 0.75 µg of relevant expression vector, or the corresponding empty vector. For experiments performed in exponentially growing cells, luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection. Normalization was achieved by co-transfecting 0.1 µg of pCH110, a β-galactosidase reporter construct as an internal control for the transfection efficiency. For mitogen-stimulated cyclin D1-luciferase reporter expression, 1 day following the transfection cells were serum-starved for 30 h and then stimulated with 10% FCS for 18 h. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured according to the Promega protocol. Data are representative for at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate and are expressed as “fold increase in luciferase activity,” which was calculated relative to the basal level of cyclin D1 reporter activity set to 1 unit and corrected for empty vector effects for each expression vector. Cyclin D1 protein expression analyses were performed in CCL39 cells seeded at a density of 600,000 cells per well in six-well plates, co-transfected by the calcium phosphate technique with 6 µg of the selection vector pNHE3, together with 14 µg of relevant expression vector. Two days following the transfection, cells were submitted to an acid-load selection (45Pouysségur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G. Paris S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4833-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) in the presence of the HOE694 compound to inhibit the endogenous NHE1 antiporter activity, so that only transfected cells expressing the NHE3 isoform survived (46Counillon L. Scholz W. Lang H.J. Pouysségur J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1041-1045PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then allowed to recover for at least 4 h before serum starvation. Cells were lysed 3 days following the transfection, and cyclin D1 expression was monitored by immunoblotting using the antisera described above. Expression of the transfected MAPK constructs was checked for each experiment using the appropriated antibody. Cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and proteins from whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% gels or in 7.5% gels for pRb detection. For p42MAPK “shift up” experiments, the percentage of bisacrylamide was reduced to 0.07% (final), and samples were run on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were detected immunologically following electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (47Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Sigma), revealed by the ECL detection system (Amersham), was used to detect the antigen-antibody complexes. Protein concentrations were measured using a modified Lowry procedure (48Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Quantitative analyses of protein levels were performed by scanning of the autoradiograms (Fugi PhosphoImager, Paris, France) and are representative of more than two independent experiments. D-type cyclin expression profile was analyzed in whole cell extracts of G0-arrested Chinese hamster fibroblasts (CCL39), by Western blot technique using specific antibodies. In G0-arrested CCL39 cells, cyclin D1 protein expression was barely detectable (Fig. 1). However, serum stimulation of cells led to a dramatic accumulation of cyclin D1 protein that became easily detectable at 6 h poststimulation and increased until cells entered S-phase (Fig. 1A). As previously shown in other fibroblastic cell lines (30Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Draetta G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 49Sewing A. Burger C. Brusselbach S. Schalk C. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 545-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the protein expression level of cyclin D1 in CCL39 cells was not cell cycle-modulated and only a modest peak of accumulation was observed in late G1 (12-16 h poststimulation). Cyclin D2 and D3 expression were also analyzed in CCL39 cells using specific monoclonal antibodies. In contrast to cyclin D1, for that expression was strictly dependent on the presence of mitogens, cyclin D3 was present in resting cells and its level was poorly increased by growth factors (Fig. 1A). Cyclin D2 was not detectable in either quiescent or growth factor-stimulated CCL39 cells. The hyperphosphorylation of pRb was analyzed for each time point following serum stimulation of resting cells. A specific antibody able to detect the active hypophosphorylated form of pRb (lower band) as well as the inactive hyperphosphorylated form of the protein (upper band) was used. In G0-arrested cells, pRb was exclusively found in its active hypophosphorylated state, suggesting that cyclin D3, although expressed does not contribute to pRb phosphorylation in this cell system and thus, is not a limiting factor for progression through G1-phase of the cell cycle. However, pRb inactivation (hyperphosphorylated form) became apparent at 10-12 h poststimulation, when cyclin D1 expression was maximal (Fig. 1A, lower panel) and when the first cells enter S-phase. 5G. L'Allemain, J. N. Lavoie, and J. Pouysségur, unpublished data. The results suggest that cyclin D1 is the major mitogen-regulated D-type cyclin identifiable in this cell system and, therefore, that its associated kinase activity is likely to participate in pRb inactivation by phosphorylation. Previous studies demonstrated that in fibroblasts only potent mitogens that drive the G0 to S-phase transition can maintain a long term activation of the p42/p44MAPK cascade (11Meloche S. Seuwen K. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 845-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial experiments to link this signal transduction pathway to mitogen regulation of cyclin D1 expression revealed a tight correlation between the extent of cyclin D1 accumulation and the ability of various agents to induce sustained p42MAPK activation. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h and stimulated for 9 h in the presence of various agonists, and whole cell extracts were analyzed for cyclin D1 protein levels, pRb phosphorylation, and p42MAPK activity. The polyclonal anti-p42MAPK antibody used detected three electrophoretically distinct forms of the kinase: a fast-migrating band representing the inactive unphosphorylated form of the endogenous p42MAPK, an intermediate band that corresponds to the phosphorylated and active enzyme, and an upper, slow-migrating form that corresponds to cross-reactivity of the antibody with the p44MAPK isoform (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Cyclin D1-associated kinase activity that is mainly dependent on the level of cyclin D1 was also evaluated in each sample by analyzing pRB phosphorylation. The ability of the various mitogens to induce cyclin D1 expression and pRb hyperphosphorylation was closely related to their ability to maintain p42MAPK activities throughout G1 progression of the cell cycle (Fig. 1B). Only potent mitogens, such as whole serum and thrombin, which potently initiate DNA synthesis in arrested CCL39 cells, were able to promote high levels of cyclin D1 accumulation and allow pRb phosphorylation (appearance of a minor slow-migrating band at 9 h post-stimulation) (Fig. 1B, middle panel). Whereas a slight effect was observed with a weakly mitogenic combination of epidermal growth factor plus insulin, neither factor alone was able to promote long term p42MAPK activation, cyclin D1 expression, and pRb phosphorylation, suggesting an interdependent relationship between the long lasting activation phase of p42/p44MAPKs, cyclin D1 expression, and pRb inactivation in CCL39 fibroblasts. To investigate the role of the p42/p44MAPK signaling pathway in the regulation of cyclin D1 expression more directly, we used previously characterized expression constructs to modulate either positively or negatively the endogenous p42/p44MAPK activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cyclin D1 transcription was monitored by transfecting CCL39 cells with a previously cloned fragment of the human cyclin D1 promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene (D1Δ-944) (39Herber B. Truss M. Beato M. Muller R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1295-1304PubMed Google Scholar), together with the relevant constructs. The results showed that the p42/p44MAPK activity strongly affects cyclin D1 transcription in CCL39 cells. When a constitutively activated form of MAPK kinase (MKK1-SS/DD) was expressed, a large increase in luciferase expression (6-10-fold) could be detected in exponentially growing cells, when compared with the luciferase expression in control cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 2A). This dramatic up-regulation of the cyclin D1 reporter expression in cells overexpressing the constitutively active MKK1 mutant likely resulted from a higher p42/p44MAPK activity in these cells, since co-expression of the MAPK phosphatase (MKP-1), a dual specificity phosphatase shown to be able to inactivate p42/p44MAPKs (42Sun H.

The levels of insoluble Aβ in AD brains are at least 100 times higher than those found in control brains. The amounts of water-soluble Aβ in AD brains are approximately six times higher than those detected in control brains. Interestingly, we isolated an Aβ fraction, from the Aβ water-soluble oligomeric pool, with a molecular mass of <10 kDa containing monomeric and/or dimeric forms of Aβ peptide (13Kuo Y.-M.

In addition, the potential for toxicity of the AD brain-derived Aβ-(1-40/42) dimer was assessed on glial-neuronal cell cultures. Alzheimer's disease atomic force microscopy low density lipoprotein N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. Brains were obtained from eight patients who died of AD (postmortem delay 3-6 h). After separation of the leptomeninges, the right hemispheres were frozen at −70°C. Examination of the left hemispheres revealed numerous neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of AD as established by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) (16Mirra S.S. Hart M.N. Terry R.D. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1993; 117: 132-144PubMed Google Scholar). The cerebral cortices were minced, gently homogenized, and submitted to a series of isocratic sucrose fractionations (0.25, 1.2, and 1.9 M sucrose) in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitors (2Roher A.E.

The resulting white flocculent precipitate (containing Aβ-(1-42)) was recovered by centrifugation, and both pellet and supernatant (predominantly Aβ-(1-40)) were submitted to Superose 12 column (Pharmacia, Upsala, Sweden) chromatography developed with 80% glass distilled formic acid (2Roher A.E.

Purification of amyloid peptides from leptomeningeal vessels followed the protocol already published by our laboratory (14Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Gowing E. Ball M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10836-10840Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides (Aβ-(1-40) and -(1-42)) were either obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA) or from California Peptide Research Inc. (Napa, CA). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out on a 10-20% Tris-Tricine gradient gel (Novex, San Diego, CA). Peptides were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and reacted with antibody 4G8 (Zenetek, Maryland Heights, MO) against Aβ residues 17-24. Aβ specimens were prepared for AFM analysis on pyrolytic graphite (ZYB Grade, Advanced Ceramics, Cleveland, OH). Image data were generated on a NanoScope III MultiMode scanning probe workstation (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara CA). A full description of the methodology has been previously reported (17Stine W.B. Snyder S.W. Ladror U.S. Wade W.S. Miller M.F. Perun T.J. Holzman T.F. Krafft G.A. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For electron microscopy, platinum replicas were prepared according to previously published methods (18Bonnell B. Chandler D. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 105: 123-132Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Mica slabs containing the Aβ samples were rotary-shadowed with platinum in a Balzer's freeze-fracture apparatus. Platinum replicas were placed on copper grids and examined with a Phillips Electron Microscope 300. Rat microglia were isolated from confluent dissociated brain cell cultures by rotatory shaking for 18 h (19Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were placed in N2 media containing gentamicin (48 µg/ml) and recovered by selective adhesion to plastic after 2 h. Highly enriched populations (>99% homogeneity) were identified by scanning EM, presence of phagocytic activity, and presence of scavenger receptor using Ac-LDL bound to the fluorescent probe 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′- tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI-Ac-LDL; Biomedical Technologies Inc.). Cultured neurons prepared from rat hippocampus were used in toxicity studies as described previously (20Giulian D. Haverkamp L.J. Li J. Karshin W.L. Yu J. Tom D. Li X. Kirkpatrick J.B. Neurochem. Int. 1995; 27: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat hippocampal neurons (fetal day 18) were plated onto poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips in 24-well plates at 250,000 cells per well in N2 culture media and 5% fetal bovine serum. Gradual reduction of serum began on day 7 in vitro by 1:1 volume replacement with chemically defined media. Cultures consisted of process-bearing neurons (10-20% of total cell population) on top of a bed of astroglia (>70%) mixed with microglia (5-10%). In order to eliminate microglia, cultures were exposed to saporin, a ribosome-inactivating protein (21Davis T.L. Wiley R.G. Brain Res. 1989; 504: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) coupled to acetylated LDL (Ac-LDL), on culture day 8, at concentrations of 1 µg/ml. Saporin-Ac-LDL selectively bound to scavenger receptors and reduced microglial numbers to <0.1% of the total population but had no effect on the viability of either neurons or astroglia (data not shown). After 14 days in vitro, cultures (with a final concentration of 0.6% serum) were exposed to Aβ peptides for 72 h. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 6 h and immuno-stained by overnight incubation with a mixture of anti-neurofilament antibodies (SMI-311, 1:150; RT-97, 1:150; Sternberger Monoclonals, Inc.) plus anti-MAP-2 (Boehringer Mannheim; 1:200) at 4°C in the presence of 2% horse serum and 0.3% Triton X-100. Indirect immunofluorescence labeling used biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories, 1:200) and rhodamine streptavidin (Jackson Immuno-Research, 1:1200) in buffered saline, pH 7.6. Amyloid proteins purified from AD neuritic plaque cores or from the leptomeningeal vessels can be fractionated into five components by size exclusion chromatography in the presence of either 80% formic acid or 5 M guanidine thiocyanate, pH 7.4. Three of these fractions (molecular mass 4.5, 9.0, and 13.5 kDa) corresponded to monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric Aβ (Fig. 1A). Of the total neuritic plaque Aβ shown in Fig. 1A, 85-95% represents Aβ-(1-42) and 5-15% represents Aβ-(1-40) (2Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Wolkow C. Wang R. Cotter R.J. Reardon I.M. Zürcher-Neely H.A. Heinrikson R.L. Ball M.J. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3072-3083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the Aβ-(1-42) in the leptomeningeal vessels ranges from 40 to 60% (14Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Gowing E. Ball M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10836-10840Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The presence of Aβ-(1-42) was demonstrated by tryptic digestion and CNBr cleavage that yielded the 36-42 peptide of Aβ. The quantitative relationship between monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric Aβ-(1-40) and -(1-42) together, recovered from several independent preparations from amyloid cores and vascular amyloid, can be expressed as an average ratio of 55:30:15 (monomer: 48 − 65%; dimer: 21 − 36%; trimer: 12 − 21%), respectively. The ratios were determined by integration of the area defined by the chromatographic peaks. Column chromatography of synthetic Aβ-(1-42), in different concentrations of formic acid (80, 60, 40%), did not change the ratio between monomers and dimers (data not shown). When the concentration of the formic acid was reduced to 20%, most of the peptide aggregated at the top of the chromatographic column. However, the small amount of Aβ-(1-42) eluted at this concentration still demonstrated the presence of both Aβ monomer and dimer. Synthetic Aβ-(1-40) was freshly dissolved and chromatographed in 80% formic acid. As a percentage of the total Aβ and determined by integration of peak area, dimeric Aβ yielded approximately 1%. However, synthetic peptide Aβ-(1-42), under the same conditions, generated on the average 7.4% (range: 7.0-7.7%, n = 12) dimeric Aβ. This suggests that the ability to make stable dimers, in freshly prepared solutions of synthetic Aβ, may depend upon the presence of the two C-terminal residues Ile-41 and Ala-42. Interestingly, re-chromatography of the AD and synthetic dimeric Aβ-(1-42) failed to produce the monomeric fraction. This suggests that the dimer appears to have a very stable conformational association and that monomers and dimers are not in equilibrium under these experimental conditions. However, incubation of the chromatographically purified Aβ-(1-42) monomer at 37°C, in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for a period of 12 h to 4 weeks generated increasing quantities of dimeric/trimeric Aβ-(1-42) (Fig. 1B). Re-chromatography of the dimeric/trimeric Aβ-(1-42) for various times always failed to yield the monomeric form. Tryptic digestion and CNBr cleavage of the neuritic plaque and leptomeningeal Aβ-(1-42) dimer yielded the same high performance liquid chromatography peptide maps as those observed for Aβ-(1-42) monomer (2Roher A.E.

Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1916-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The stability of the Aβ peptides was also demonstrated by Western blot where the Aβ-(1-42) monomer, dimer, and trimer retained their expected molecular mass (Fig. 1A). Likewise, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry of synthetic Aβ-(1-42) confirmed the molecular mass of the monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric forms (Fig. 1C). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) of the monomeric and dimeric fractions of AD-derived Aβ revealed a contrasting morphology. Upon removal of formic acid, by dialysis against water followed by 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate, the monomeric Aβ-(1-42) polymerized into an array of 8-10-nm diameter filaments (Fig. 2A). By contrast, the dimeric Aβ-(1-42) generated granular particles affecting the shape of prolate ellipsoids measuring 3-4 or 7-8 nm (Fig. 2B) with occasional aggregation into larger conglomerates. The 3-4-nm form may be interpreted as the basic dimeric structure. Larger forms, 7-8 nm or greater, could correspond to oligomeric aggregates of Aβ-(1-42). Platinum replicas of monomeric and dimeric AD-derived Aβ-(1-42) examined by electron microscopy also showed the monomer polymerized into 10-nm filaments (Fig. 2C). At higher magnification filamentous structures, with an axial periodicity of 20 nm, were clearly discernible in the platinum-coated structures (Fig. 2C, inset). This rope-like morphology may result from the intertwining of two proto-filaments such as those previously observed in repolymerized Aβ derived from the AD brain (15Roher A.E. Palmer K.C. Yurewicz E.C. Ball M.J. Greenberg B.D. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1916-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The 9-kDa fraction, on the other hand, revealed no filaments but rather globular particles and random aggregates similar to those observed by AFM (Fig. 2D). The biological effects of the monomeric and dimeric Aβ-(1-42) fractions, obtained from both the neuritic plaques and the leptomeningeal vascular deposits, were investigated by application to astroglial-neuronal cultures. Primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons demonstrated a robust appearance when plated on top of a bed of astrocytes in the presence of microglial cells (Fig. 3A). The latter cells were then selectively eliminated. Neurons exhibited a dramatic loss of viability in the presence of even small doses (4 µg/ml) of monomeric (data not shown) or dimeric AD-derived Aβ-(1-42) (Fig. 3B), when microglial cells were added back to the cultures. The average percentage of neuronal death, expressed as mean and standard error of the mean from triplicate experiments, was 60 ± 3% and 55 ± 3% for monomeric and dimeric Aβ-(1-42), respectively, compared with Aβ-treated microglia-free sister cultures (Fig. 3C). These latter neurons unexpectedly exhibited no loss of viability when exposed to as much as 40 µg/ml monomeric or dimeric Aβ-(1-42), in the absence of microglial cells. The lack of direct neurotoxicity of Aβ is in agreement with previous reports that show that such an effect is readily demonstrated only in low density or otherwise stressed cultures (22Mattson M.P. Cheng B. Davis D. Bryant K. Lieberburg I. Rydell R.E. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 376-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Copani A. Koh J.-Y. Cotman C.W. Neuroreport. 1991; 2: 763-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In our culture system, plated at high cell densities, a stable neuronal network is maintained among a population of supportive astroglia, a situation we believe to more closely approximate conditions found in the brain. In addition, unless microglia are specifically removed from hippocampal cultures, as we have done in testing Aβ toxicity, they may account for 5-10% of all cells present. 2D.

Both the monomeric and dimeric forms of Aβ-(1-42) result, therefore, in the induction of microglial toxicity at concentrations an order of magnitude or more below that in which any direct effects are apparent in robust cultures, and by inference in vivo. Our results indicate that both the monomeric and dimeric Aβ-(1-42) are toxic to cultured nerve cells through a microglia-dependent mechanism. Activated microglia have been shown to secrete a number of potentially neurotoxic compounds, including free radicals, cytokines, nitric oxide, and N-methyl-D-aspartate-like molecules (24Giulian D. Appel S.H. Current Neurology. Mosby -Year Book, Inc., St. Louis, MO1992: 23Google Scholar, 25Banati R.B. Gehrmann J. Schubert P. Kreutzberg G.W. Glia. 1993; 7: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). The most likely agent responsible for the Aβ-induced microglial toxicity described here, however, is the neurotoxic phenolic amine recently reported to be released by microglial cells after in vitro exposure to isolated AD plaque cores (20Giulian D. Haverkamp L.J. Li J. Karshin W.L. Yu J. Tom D. Li X. Kirkpatrick J.B. Neurochem. Int. 1995; 27: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is not apparent from the present work whether activation of the microglia to become neurotoxic is due to the Aβ monomer itself or to one of its aggregated products. In the case of the dimeric Aβ-(1-42), however, the observed microglia-dependent toxicity must be mediated through the non-polymerized form of the peptide since the Aβ dimers fail to form fibrils. The inability of the dimeric Aβ to make fibrils can be explained by its apparent morphology. The molecular size of the dimeric Aβ may facilitate the diffusion of such molecules within the intricate narrow extracellular space (10-24 nm) of the cerebral cortex. The possible effects of dimeric Aβ within the AD brain are suggested by our cell culture studies. The ability of the Aβ-(1-40/42) dimers to cause neurotoxicity in the presence of microglia shows that the dimer is possibly yet another agent of Aβ-related pathology. The potential diffusibility of the molecule may also explain the reported discordance between the amount of fibrillar amyloid deposits and the extent of neuronal pathology observed in some AD brains (26Terry R.D. Masliah E. Salmon D.P. Butters N. De Teresa R. Hill R. Hansen L.A. Katzman R. Ann. Neurol. 1991; 30: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar, 27Mann D.M. Marcyniuk B. Yates P.O. Neary D. Snowden J.S. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1988; 14: 177-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The toxicity of the dimeric Aβ-(1-40/42) also may not be limited to nerve cells. Van Nostrand's laboratory (28Davis-Salinas J. Van Nostrand W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20887-20890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that human leptomeningeal smooth muscle cells also exhibit degenerative changes when exposed to the nonaggregated form of Aβ-(1-40/42). These phenomena are not observed when the cells are exposed to the aggregated form of the peptide. It is still unclear how soluble amyloid is recruited into fibrils and to what extent it plays a role in AD neuropathology. Soluble Aβ has been detected in plaque-free Down's syndrome brains (12Teller J.K. Russo C. Debusk L.M. Angelini G. Zaccheo D. Dagna-Bricarelli F. Scartezzini P. Bertocini S. Mann D.M.A. Tabaton M. Gambetti P. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), at levels (20.4 ± 6.5 ng/g) intermediate between that of control and plaque-ridden Down's syndrome brains. This report did not distinguish between Aβ-(1-42) and Aβ-(1-40). Nevertheless, there is an elevation in the pool of soluble amyloid prior to the detection of fibrillar Aβ. Likewise, in a study utilizing the transgenic mouse FVB/N, transfected with the human β-amyloid precursor protein, the reported amount of Aβ-(1-40/42) was 62 ng/g tissue (29Hsiao K.K. Borchelt D.R. Olson K. Johannsdottir R. Kitt C. Yunis W. Xu S. Eckman C. Younkin S. Price D. Iadecola C. Clark H.B. Carlson G. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1203-1218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Histopathological analysis of these mice revealed no extracellular deposits of fibrillar amyloid despite the presence of severe behavioral changes, altered brain physiology, extensive gliosis, and premature death. The Aβ present in these transgenic mice may represent monomeric and oligomeric soluble forms of the peptide, and it may be these forms that produce the associated pathology. Similar amounts of water-soluble monomeric/oligomeric Aβ-(1-40/42) have been reported by our group in AD brain where the average amount of Aβ represents approximately 40 ng/g of cerebral cortex (13Kuo Y.-M. Emmerling M.R. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Kasunic T.C. Kirkpatrick J.B. Murdoch G.H. Ball M.J. Roher A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4077-4081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In the present report we demonstrate that Aβ dimer/trimer forms are present in purified neuritic plaque cores and in sheets of vascular amyloid. This finding allows two interpretations. First, stable soluble monomeric and oligomeric forms of Aβ may be readily incorporated into the amyloid fibrils. This proposition is favored by our previous finding that soluble monomeric and oligomeric Aβ can be isolated from the brain by ultracentrifugation and sieving techniques (13Kuo Y.-M. Emmerling M.R. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Kasunic T.C. Kirkpatrick J.B. Murdoch G.H. Ball M.J. Roher A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4077-4081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Also, small amounts of SDS-soluble monomeric and oligomeric Aβ (4, 6, 8, and 12 kDa) have been detected in the conditioned media of β-amyloid precursor protein transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (11Podlisny M.B. Ostaszewski B.L. Squazzo S.L. Koo E.H. Rydell R.E. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9564-9570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and, using chromatographic techniques, stable dimeric- and trimeric-soluble Aβ peptides have been demonstrated in human cerebrospinal fluid (30Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lee D. Keim P. Lieberburg I. Schenk D.B. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1965-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The alternative explanation for our present findings is that oligomeric forms of Aβ may also form as a result of association of monomers within the filament structure as a function of time. Presently, we cannot exclude either of the interpretations of our findings outlined here. Consistent with our experiments and those of other investigators, we wish to propose a scenario in which the cores and wisps of filamentous amyloid found in the neuritic plaques represent a depository in which toxic soluble monomeric/oligomeric Aβ is concentrated and its associated pathology confined to the sites of deposition. The frequent and intimate association of plaques with capillaries (31Miyakawa T. Katsuragi S. Yamashita K. Ohuchi K. Acta Neuropathol. 1992; 83: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and in particular with the basal lamina of these vessels (14Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Gowing E. Ball M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10836-10840Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), may be indicative of aborted attempts to rid the neuropil of this substance. The vast network of astrocytes in the cerebral cortex is one cellular candidate to mediate this process, as they are known to both take up and secrete various active and inert substances (32Vinores S.A. Herman M.M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1993; 43: 169-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33Martin D.L. Glia. 1992; 5: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). A more likely participant, however, is the microglia, which have been demonstrated to engulf debris, including injected amyloid fragments, from within the parenchyma and actively transport them to the vasculature (34Giulian D. Chen J. Ingeman J.E. George J. Noponen M. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 4416-4429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. Baird A. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 1389-1399PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated an unwanted effect of such engulfment, however, when that debris contains either dimeric or monomeric Aβ. Microglia exposed to the peptide release a potent neurotoxin (20Giulian D. Haverkamp L.J. Li J. Karshin W.L. Yu J. Tom D. Li X. Kirkpatrick J.B. Neurochem. Int. 1995; 27: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and, in their attempt to remove the soluble or aggregated amyloid, may produce further neuronal damage, and a cycle of inflammatory responses in AD brain ensues (36Rogers J.

https://openalex.org/W2045303124,"C129/U1 is a respiratory defective mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae arrested in cytochrome oxidase assembly due to a mutation in COX17, a nuclear gene encoding a low molecular weight cytoplasmic protein proposed to function in mitochondrial copper recruitment. In the present study we show that the respiratory defect of C129/U1 is rescuable by two multicopy suppressors, SCO1 and SCO2. SCO1 was earlier reported to code for a mitochondrial inner membrane protein with an essential function in cytochrome oxidase assembly (Buchwald, P., Krummeck, G., and Rodel, G. (1991) Mol. Gen. Genet. 229, 413-420). SCO2 is a homologue of SCO1, whose product is also localized in the mitochondrial membrane but is not required for respiration.SCO1 also suppresses a cox17 null mutant, indicating that overexpression of Sco1p can compensate for the absence of Cox17p. In contrast, neither copper, COX17 on a multicopy plasmid, or a combination of the two is able to restore respiration in sco1 mutants. Rescue of cox17 mutants by Sco1p suggests that this mitochondrial protein plays a role either in mitochondrial copper transport or insertion of copper into the active site of cytochrome oxidase. Although SCO2 can also partially restore respiratory growth in the cox17 null mutant, rescue in this case requires addition of copper to the growth medium. SCO2 does not suppress a sco1 null mutant, although it is able to partially rescue a sco1 point mutant. We interpret the ability of SCO2 to restore respiration in cox17, but not in sco1 mutants, to indicate that Sco1p and Sco2p have overlapping but not identical functions. C129/U1 is a respiratory defective mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae arrested in cytochrome oxidase assembly due to a mutation in COX17, a nuclear gene encoding a low molecular weight cytoplasmic protein proposed to function in mitochondrial copper recruitment.

We interpret the ability of SCO2 to restore respiration in cox17, but not in sco1 mutants, to indicate that Sco1p and Sco2p have overlapping but not identical functions. The COX17 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown to code for a cytoplasmic protein that is essential for assembly of cytochrome oxidase (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The respiratory defect of cox17 mutants is correctable by exogenous copper, indicating an insufficiency of mitochondrial copper as the basis for the assembly arrest. Cox17p is a low molecular mass protein (8 kDa) with 7 cysteine residues, of which at least one is functionally important (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The copper deficiency in cox17 mutants appears to be confined to cytochrome oxidase. The presence in a cox17 null mutant of cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase (2Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4793-4796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the iron transporter encoded by FET3 (3Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), both of which use copper as cofactors, provides strong evidence that Cox17p targets copper to mitochondria (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The COX17 gene was cloned by complementation of the cytochrome oxidase deficiency of the cox17 mutant, C129/U1, with a yeast genomic plasmid library (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Transformations of this mutant yielded two other plasmids that did not contain COX17. In this communication, we show that these high copy suppressors of C129/U1 are SCO1 (4Schulze M. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and SCO2 (5Smits P.H.M. de Haan M. Maat C. Grivell L.A. Yeast. 1994; 10: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SCO1 has been reported to code for a cytochrome oxidase assembly factor (4Schulze M. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). SCO2 was identified through the yeast genome sequencing project (5Smits P.H.M. de Haan M. Maat C. Grivell L.A. Yeast. 1994; 10: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although the two genes code for homologous proteins, a null mutation in SCO2 does not elicit a discernable phenotype. Sco1p and Sco2p are both membrane constituents of mitochondria, but do not appear to be associated in a stable complex. Suppression of cox17 mutants by SCO1 indicates that the product of this gene also plays a role in providing copper for cytochrome oxidase. The failure of sco1 mutants to form the mature complex is proposed to be caused either by a deficiency in mitochondrial copper uptake or by failure to insert copper during assembly of cytochrome oxidase.

The library used for the transformation was constructed from partial Sau3A fragments of nuclear DNA (averaging 7-10 kb) 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase pairbpbase pair. cloned into the BamHI site of the shuttle vector YEp24 (8Botstein D.

Approximately 5 × 108 cells were transformed with 100 µg of plasmid DNA. The transformation mixtures were plated on minimal glucose medium to select for plasmid-bearing clones (approximately 105 uracil-positive clones). The minimal glucose plates were replicated on rich glycerol medium, and growth was scored after 2-5 days of incubation at 30°C. SCO1 was also cloned independently by transformation of the sco1 mutant E428/U1 with the same genomic library. kilobase pair base pair. Wild-type and mutant yeast were grown to stationary phase in YPGal (2% galactose, 1% yeast extract, and 2% peptone) and mitochondria were prepared by the procedure of Faye et al. (9Faye G. Kujawa C. Fukuhara H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), except that Glusulase was replaced by Zymolyase 20,000 (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) to prepare spheroplasts. Cytochrome oxidase activity was measured by following oxidation of ferrocytochrome c at 550 nm (10Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To create a gene expressing Sco1p with covalently attached biotin at its carboxyl terminus (11Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the termination codon of SCO1 was destroyed and replaced by a BamHI site. A HindIII site was created 296 bp upstream of the start codon, and the amplified 1.2-kb fragment was digested with HindIII and BamHI and cloned into YEp352-Bio5. The resultant construct consisted of the entire SCO1 coding sequence fused in-frame to the 270-nucleotide fragment coding for the biotinylation signal sequence of bacterial transcarboxylase (12Murtif V.L. Bahler C.R. Samols D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5617-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The fusion gene was transferred to the multicopy shuttle vector YEp351 and to the integrative plasmid YIp351 (13Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). A null allele of SCO1 was made by cloning the 1.7-kb EcoRI fragment containing SCO1 into YEp352E. YEp352E is identical to YEp352 (13Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar), except that the multiple cloning region of the latter plasmid is replaced with a unique EcoRI site. This plasmid was linearized at the SphI site inside SCOI and ligated to a 1.2-kb linear SphI fragment with the yeast URA3 gene. Respiratory deficient and uracil-independent transformants (W303ΔSCO1) were obtained and verified to have the disrupted allele by backcrosses to a sco1 mutant and by Southern analysis of genomic DNA. The sco2::URA3 allele was created by replacement of the 450-bp AflII fragment internal to the coding sequence with the URA3 gene. pSG74/ST4 was digested with AflII, and the linear plasmid was ligated to an SphI linker. The yeast URA3 gene (as a 1.1-kb SphI fragment) was ligated to the SphI site in the gapped gene. The disrupted sco2::URA3 allele was isolated on a linear fragment and used to transform the respiratory competent haploid strains W303-1A and W303-1B by the one-step gene replacement procedure (14Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 201-211Google Scholar). Uracil-independent transformants were selected and verified to have the disrupted alleles by Southern analysis of their chromosomal DNA (see Fig. 2). In order to generate antibodies to the SCO2 gene product, the gene was amplified by PCR, with primers which created a BamHI site at amino acid residue 11 and a HindIII site 120-bp downstream of the stop codon. This fragment was ligated into the expression vector pATH20 (15Koerner T.J. Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), creating an in-frame fusion with the Escherichia coli trpE gene. The fusion protein expressed from the trpE fusion constituted most of the insoluble protein fraction of the E. coli cells. This fraction was dissolved in a 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 buffer, containing 2% SDS, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the Sco2-fusion protein was further purified on a Bio-Gel A0.5 column developed with a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Fractions containing primarily the fusion protein were pooled, concentrated by acetone precipitation, and used to raise antibodies in rabbits. Standard procedures were used for the preparation and ligation of DNA fragments and for transformation and recovery of plasmid DNA from E. coli (16Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The preparation of yeast nuclear DNA and the conditions for the Southern hybridizations were as described by Myers et al. (17Myers A.M. Pape K.L. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). DNA probes were labeled by random priming (18Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar), and DNA was sequenced by the method of Maxam and Gilbert (19Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the buffer system of Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and Western blots were treated with antibodies against Sco2p followed by a second reaction with 125I-protein A (21Schmidt R.J. Myers A.M. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1984; 1: 317-334PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, biotin-containing proteins were visualized with peroxidase conjugated to avidin (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C129 is a cytochrome oxidase defective mutant of S. cerevisiae with a single point mutation in COX17 (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The COX17 gene was cloned by complementation of C129/U1 with a yeast genomic library (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Some of the respiratory competent clones obtained from the transformations, however, were found to have plasmids with genomic fragments unrelated to one another or to COX17. The physical maps of two such plasmids indicated the presence of SCO1, a gene coding for a cytochrome oxidase assembly factor (4Schulze M. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Buchwald P. Krummeck G. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The identity of SCO1 as the suppressor was corroborated by the ability of pG41/T2 and pG41/ST8 to confer respiration to C129/U1. pG41/T2 was cloned independently by transformation of a sco1 mutant. pG41/ST8 is a subclone of pG41/T2 containing only SCO1 (Fig. 1). SCO1 codes for a constituent of the yeast mitochondrial inner membrane and is essential for the expression of cytochrome oxidase (4Schulze M. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Buchwald P. Krummeck G. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mutations in SCO1 induce a specific deficiency in cytochrome oxidase but do not substantially affect other enzymes of the respiratory chain or of the ATPase (4Schulze M. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Buchwald P. Krummeck G. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).

Genet. 1991; 229: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and to accumulate the nuclear gene products has led to the suggestion that Sco1p promotes some late post-translational step in the assembly pathway (4Schulze M.

Genet. 1991; 229: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), although its precise function has not been clarified. Two other plasmids (pSG74/T1 and T2) obtained by transformation of C129/U1 had overlapping inserts unrelated to either COX17 or SCO1 (Fig. 1). Partial sequencing of the insert in pSG74/T1 revealed that it contained a fragment of yeast chromosome II with SCO2, a homologue of SCO1 (5Smits P.H.M. de Haan M. Maat C. Grivell L.A. Yeast. 1994; 10: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Restoration of respiration in C129/U1 by pSG74/ST4, but not by pSG74/ST5 (with a 450-bp deletion in the SCO2-coding region), confirmed SCO2 to be a second high copy suppressor. The function of the SCO2 product is not known. The phenotype of a mutant with a null allele of the gene (see below) precludes a requirement for the protein in respiration. To facilitate further studies on the relationship of Cox17p to Sco1p and Sco2p, null alleles of SCO1 or SCO2 were constructed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Mutants with a disrupted chromosomal copy of SCO1 (aW303ΔSCO1) are unable to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources and exhibit a deficiency in cytochrome oxidase, as reported previously (4Schulze M. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, W303ΔSCO2, carrying a null mutation in SCO2, had a respiratory competent phenotype and normal levels of cytochrome oxidase. The replacement of the wild-type gene by the sco2::URA3 allele in W303ΔSCO2 was confirmed by a genomic Southern (Fig. 2). Additional evidence for the absence of Sco2p in W303ΔSCO2 was obtained by immunological assays of Sco2p in mitochondria from the mutant, the parental wild-type strain, and a transformant harboring SCO2 on a multicopy plasmid. Western analysis of total mitochondrial proteins, with an antibody against the protein expressed from the SCO2/trpE fusion gene, indicates the presence of a protein of approximately 30 kDa in wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 3A). This mass is consistent with the molecular mass of Sco2p based on the derived protein sequence, assuming that some 4 kDa are lost during processing of the precursor. The 30-kDa protein detected by the antibody is much more abundant in mitochondria from a transformant harboring SCO2 on a high copy plasmid and is absent in W303ΔSCO2. The absence of a signal in the null mutant confirms that this mitochondrial constituent is not required for respiration. Mitochondria from two other strains were also probed with the same antibody. W303ΔSCO1 has a disrupted chromosomal copy of SCO1, and W303ΔSCO1/ST12 is the identical mutant transformed with a fusion gene expressing biotinylated Sco1p-Bio, approximately 7 kDa larger than the native protein. The absence of a cross-reacting protein of 37 kDa in mitochondria from W303ΔSCO1/ST12 and the lack of an effect of the sco1 mutation on the strength of the signal indicates that the antibody specifically recognizes Sco2p. The Sco2p antibody was used to determine whether this protein is a mitochondrial membrane protein like Sco1p. Mitochondria prepared from the respiratory competent strain W303-1B were disrupted by sonication and the membrane and soluble fractions were probed for Sco2p. The Western blot, shown in Fig. 3B, indicates Sco2p to be present exclusively in the submitochondrial membrane fraction. Solubilization of Sco2p requires extraction of mitochondria with 0.2-0.5% deoxycholate and 0.5 M NaCl, further confirming the hydrophobic nature of this protein (Fig. 3C). C129/U1 has a point mutation in COX17 resulting in the substitution of a tyrosine for the carboxyl-proximal cysteine in the protein (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). To test if overexpression of SCO1 and SCO2 can also suppress a cox17 null mutant, W303ΔCOX17, harboring a disrupted copy of COX17, was transformed with pG41/ST8 (SCO1), pSG74/ST4 (SCO2), and as a control, also with pG74/ST8, a multicopy plasmid containing COX17. The respiratory competent parental strain, W303-1B, and the different transformants were replicated on rich glycerol/ethanol medium (YEPG) and scored for growth after 3 days of incubation at 30°C (Fig. 4, top plate). The null mutant was partially suppressed by SCO1, but not by SCO2 (Fig. 4, top plate). The generation time of the mutant transformed with SCO1 was approximately double that of the wild-type strain. Growth of C129/U1 and W303ΔCOX17 on mitochondrial substrates is rescued by addition of exogenous copper to the growth medium (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The effect of copper supplementation was also tested on the cox17 mutants transformed with SCO1 and SCO2. The somewhat leaky growth phenotype of C129/U1 made it difficult to score differences in the growth of this strain as a function of the different plasmids and the copper supplement. In the case of W303ΔCOX17, copper supplementation clearly enhanced the suppressor activity of SCO1 with the null mutant. Addition of copper to the medium also allowed SCO2 to partially suppress the respiratory defect in the null mutant (Fig. 4, middle plate), at a concentration lower than that required to rescue the null mutant itself (Fig. 4, bottom plate). Suppression by SCO1, and to a lesser degree by SCO2, of the cytochrome oxidase deficiency of cox17 mutations suggested that the products of the two genes might be involved in mitochondrial copper metabolism. Unlike cox17 mutants, neither the sco1 null mutant, nor seven independent sco1 point mutants were rescued by inclusion of 0.01-0.8% copper in the medium. Neither were the mutants rescued with high copy numbers of either COX17 or CTR1 (the structural gene for the plasma membrane copper pump) (25Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), either in the presence or absence of added copper. In previous studies, the concentration of copper needed to restore respiratory growth of the cox17 null mutant could be significantly lowered (>10-fold) when it was transformed with CTR1 on a high copy plasmid (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the plasma membrane copper pump was presumed to increase internal copper pools, thereby allowing rescue to occur in the presence of lower exogenous copper (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The primary sequence homology of Sco1p and Sco2p, and their activity as suppressors of the cox17 allele in C129/U1, suggested that they might have similar or overlapping functions. Transformation of W303ΔSCO1 with SCO2 (pSG74/ST4), however, failed to restore respiratory growth in the sco1 null mutant, indicating that the two proteins are not exchangeable and therefore cannot be functionally equivalent. When tested for suppression of point mutations, SCO2 was found to partially rescue one of the seven sco1 mutants tested (W30). The allele-specific suppression of a sco1 mutant by SCO2 could indicate that a physical interaction of Sco1p and Sco2p is necessary for function. This is contradicted by the observation that the sco2 null mutant has no phenotype on nonfermentable carbon sources. Attempts to detect a physical complex of the two proteins also were unsuccessful. Extraction of Sco1p-Bio and purification of the biotinylated protein by affinity chromatography on a monomeric avidin column failed to disclose copurification of Sco2p. Secondly, although both Sco1p and Sco2p sediment with apparent molecular masses of approximately 60 kDa, the sedimentation behavior of Sco2p was the same in a strain with a sco1 null mutation (data not shown). Finally, suppression by overexpression of Sco1p or Sco2p alone is difficult to rationalize if the two proteins are subunits of a stoichiometric complex. The cytochrome oxidase deficiency of cox17 mutants was previously shown to be corrected by exogenous copper (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). This observation together with the cytoplasmic localization of Cox17p led us to propose a role for this low molecular weight protein in targeting copper to mitochondria (1Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate rescue of cox17 mutants, including a strain with a null allele of the gene, by overexpression of Sco1p, a constituent of the mitochondrial inner membrane, encoded by SCO1 (23Buchwald P. Krummeck G. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The suppressor activity of SCO1 suggests an involvement of the product, Sco1p, in mitochondrial copper metabolism. Since sco1 mutants are not rescued by COX17, Sco1p is likely to act downstream of Cox17p, either prior to or during the copper maturation step. An alignment of yeast Sco1p with several homologues from eucaryotic and procaryotic sources reveals a potential copper binding domain characterized by the presence of two conserved cysteines whose spacing and proximity to a short conserved hydrophobic domain is reminiscent of the copper binding domain of subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase (Fig. 5). Sco1p could be a mitochondrial copper carrier, accepting copper from Cox17p and translocating it to the mitochondrial matrix. This model implies that copper addition to subunits 1 and 2 of the enzyme occurs on the matrix side of the inner membrane (Fig. 6, scheme A), perhaps before subunits 1 and 2 of cytochrome oxidase are fully integrated in the lipid bilayer. Excess Sco1p may help to correct lesions in Cox17p by increasing the efficiency of copper uptake from alternate cellular pools. Sco1p could also be a mitochondrial copper storage and/or transfer protein more directly involved in addition of copper to the cytochrome oxidase precursor (Fig. 6, scheme B). Copper need not be transferred across the inner membrane if addition occurs in the intermembrane space where the active site of the mature enzyme resides (31Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). According to this model also, overexpression of Sco1p could compensate for the absence of the mitochondrial copper targeting protein by allowing for a more efficient uptake or transfer of copper during maturation of the enzyme. Overexpression of Sco2p can partially suppress the respiratory defect of a cox17 point mutant and a strain with a null allele, the latter in the presence of added copper. The activity of SCO2 on a high copy plasmid as an allele-specific suppressor of sco1 mutations could mean that Sco1p and Sco2p exist and function as a complex. Even though the molecular weight of Sco1p and Sco2p is two times the monomer size, no evidence could be obtained for a complex of the two proteins. The dependence of function on such a complex, even if it exists, is also unlikely in view of the absence of a discernable phenotype in the sco2 deletion mutant. An alternative explanation for allele-specific suppression of a sco1 mutation by SCO2 is that the product of this gene is able to provide one of the Sco1p functions lost in the mutant. A redundancy in one of the activities of these two proteins would explain the lack of a phenotype in the sco2-disrupted strain."

INTRODUCTIONFK506 is a potent immunosuppressive drug that binds to a family of related intracellular receptors termed FK506-binding proteins, varying in size from 12 to 54 kDa. Among these FKBPs, 1The abbreviations used are: FKBPFK506-binding proteinFKBP12a 12-kDa FKBPFKBP12.6isoform of FKBP with slightly slower mobility than FKBP12PPIasecis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomeraseRyR-1 and RyR-2ryanodine receptor isoform 1 from skeletal muscle and isoform 2 from heart, respectivelySkMskeletal muscleSRsarcoplasmic reticulumTCterminal cisternae of SRCSRcardiac SRCRCcalcium release channelCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonateHEDTAN-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine-N,N′,N″-triacetic acidGST/FKBP12 and GST/FKBP12.6fusion proteins of glutathione S-transferase with FKBP12 and FKBP12.6, respectivelyIHMimidazole homogenization medium. FKBP12 is the most abundant and is involved in mediating the immunosuppressive action of FK506 in T lymphocytes. All of the known FKBP family members display cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity that is inhibited by FK506 and a structurally related compound, rapamycin (1Wiederrecht G. Etzkorn F. Perspect. Drug Discov. Des. 1994; 2: 57-84Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, neither the immunosuppressive nor toxic side effects (including severe neuro- and nephrotoxicity) associated with FK506 therapy result from the inhibition of PPIase activity. Rather, the action of FK506 results from the specific inhibition of calcineurin by the FKBP12·drug complex. Calcineurin is a calcium-dependent protein phosphatase involved in the activation of T-lymphocytes (2Liu J. Farmer J. Lane W. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar). FKBP12 is a mere bystander protein during T-cell activation that becomes involved in blocking activation after it binds FK506.To date, the only physiological function directly associated with FKBP12 is its tight binding to (3Collins J.H.

Ogunbumni E. Freund E. Wiederrecht G. Marks A.R. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22992-22999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both FK506 and rapamycin bind to and dissociate FKBP12 from the SkM CRC (5Timerman A.P. Ogunbumni E. Freund E. Wiederrecht G. Marks A.R. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22992-22999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the native and FKBP-stripped CRCs have similar unitary conductance and sensitivity to ruthenium red (6Mayrleitner M. Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Fleischer S. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, in comparison to the native SkM CRC, the FKBP-stripped channel is activated by lower concentrations of calcium or caffeine (5Timerman A.P. Ogunbumni E. Freund E. Wiederrecht G. Marks A.R. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22992-22999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mayrleitner M. Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Fleischer S. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), displays, by single channel analysis, both longer mean open times and greater open probabilities (6Mayrleitner M. Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Fleischer S. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and requires greater concentrations of magnesium for inactivation (10Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Marcy A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2451-2459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These effects are reversed upon rebinding human recombinant FKBP12. Thus, FKBP12 appears to stabilize a closed conformation of the RyR-1 channel from SR vesicles. Brillantes et al. (7Brillantes A.M. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasova E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Lander M. Ehrlich B.E. Marks A.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) reported that the cloned RyR-1, expressed in either Sf9 cells or Xenopus oocytes, flickers equally between four different subconductance states, and that the addition of FKBP12 to the expressed channel converts this subconductance activity to the full conductance state observed in native channels. Ahern et al. (8Ahern G.P. Junankar P.R. Dulhunty A.F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) have also reported subconductance states of skeletal muscle CRC after treatment with FK506. In summary, some of the characteristics of the SkM CRC are conferred in part by FKBP12. The role of PPIase activity of FKBP12 in CRC function remains in question since both wild-type FKBP12 and PPIase-deficient mutants bind to and restore the net calcium loading rate of FKBP-stripped TC vesicles to comparable levels (10Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Marcy A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2451-2459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).We have recently characterized an exchange reaction between FKBP12, tightly bound to the SkM CRC of TC vesicles, with soluble 35S-labeled FKBP12 (10Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Marcy A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2451-2459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The exchange rate is enhanced with increasing temperature from 0 to 37°C. The exchange is essentially negligible in the cold (0-4°C) for several hours. At 37°C, the EC50 for exchange is 0.30 µM FKBP12, with a half-time of less than 5 min. The concentration of FKBP12 in skeletal muscle cytosol is about 3 µM (10Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Marcy A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2451-2459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, given the concentration and temperature dependence for exchange, our studies indicate that FKBP12, bound to the SkM CRC, is in rapid equilibrium with the myoplasmic pool of FKBP12. In contrast to this exchange phenomenon, 35S-labeled FKBP12 binds rapidly (less than 3 min) to FKBP-stripped TC vesicles, even in the cold (0-4°C) (10Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Marcy A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2451-2459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This difference in the temperature requirement for exchange versus direct binding to unoccupied FKBP binding sites provides a useful method to distinguish the labeling of SR vesicles with soluble 35S-labeled FKBP via a direct binding versus exchange mechanism. Direct binding studies in the cold enabled us to estimate that just 6% of the total FKBP binding sites in rabbit skeletal muscle TC are unoccupied (10Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Marcy A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2451-2459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).We have reported that the cardiac calcium release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR-2) isolated from CHAPS-solubilized canine heart SR vesicles is tightly associated with FKBP-C (cardiac) (11Timerman A.P.

This previously uncharacterized FKBP now appears to be identical to FKBP12.6, a novel FKBP12 isoform recently isolated, cloned, and characterized (12Sewell T. Lam E. Martin M. Leszyk J. Weidner J.

FKBP-C (cardiac), isolated from the purified canine cardiac CRC, and FKBP12.6 share an identical N-terminal amino acid sequence that is distinct from FKBP12 and comigrate during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis with a relative mobility that is slightly slower than FKBP12 (11Timerman A.P.

Both FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 isoforms share many structural and functional similarities, including: 1) 85% amino acid sequence homology; 2) PPIase activity that is inhibited by either FK506 or rapamycin; and 3) ability when complexed with FK506 to inhibit calcineurin (12Sewell T. Lam E. Martin M. Leszyk J. Weidner J. Calaycay J. Griffin P. Williams H. Hung S. Cryan J. Sigal N. Wiederrecht G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21094-21102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that FKBP12.6 and FKBP12 are equipotent inhibitors of calcineurin-dependent signaling pathways in Jurkat cells (13Lam E. Martin M. Timerman A.P. Sabers C.

In summary, the two FKBP12 isoforms display nearly identical properties in every respect with one important exception; FKBP12.6, but not FKBP12, is tightly associated with the cardiac CRC of canine heart SR vesicles (13Lam E. Martin M. Timerman A.P. Sabers C. Fleischer S. Lucas T. Abraham R.T. O'Keefe S.J. O'Neill E.A. Wiederrecht G. J. Biol.

We find a specificity for the cardiac RyR-2 to bind FKBP12.6 over FKBP12, whereas the skeletal muscle RyR-1 binds both FKBP12 isoforms with comparable affinity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSoluble FKBP12.6 Exchanges with FKBP Bound to RyR-2 of CSRThe exchange of soluble 35S-labeled FKBP12.6 with the cardiac CRC complex of canine heart SR is time- and temperature-dependent (Fig. 1A). The exchange is represented as specific binding (i.e. total minus nonspecific) of 35S-labeled FKBP12.6. These results are similar to the exchange reaction described between soluble 35S-labeled FKBP12 with skeletal muscle TC (10Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Marcy A. Fleischer S. J. Biol.

That is, the reaction rate is enhanced with increasing temperature from 0 to 37°C with a t1/2 at 37°C of 5-10 min. Although the rate of exchange is significantly reduced at 0-4°C, the exchange of 35S-labeled FKBP12.6 with CSR occurs somewhat more rapidly in the cold than the exchange of 35S-labeled FKBP12 with skeletal muscle TC (10Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Marcy A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2451-2459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).The exchange process in CSR is likewise concentration-dependent (Fig. 1B). Scatchard analysis (data not shown) of the specific binding data obtained from the exchange isotherm yields a single straight line consistent with one type of binding with an apparent dissociation constant of 156 ± 43 nM and an apparent Bmax value of 23.1 ± 3.0 pmol FKBP12.6 binding site/mg CSR protein (n = 3). The Bmax value for high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding to the same SR preparations is 5.7 pmol/mg SR protein (data not shown). Since the tetrameric cardiac CRC complex has just a single high affinity ryanodine binding site under these assay conditions (20McGrew S. Wolleben C. Siegl P. Inui M. Fleischer S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1686-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the stoichiometry of FKBP12.6 binding sites per cardiac CRC is calculated from the ratio of Bmax values for FKBP12.6 and high affinity ryanodine binding. Our results yield a stoichiometry of 4.1 FKBP12.6 binding sites per cardiac CRC. This is essentially the same value as that determined for the number of FKBP12 binding sites per SkM CRC (5Timerman A.P. Ogunbumni E. Freund E. Wiederrecht G. Marks A.R. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22992-22999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Marcy A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2451-2459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 1, A and B, can be used to calculate the percentage of unoccupied FKBP12.6 binding sites in canine heart SR vesicles. The rapid binding in the cold (i.e. the zero time-point in Fig. 1A) of 35S-labeled FKBP12.6 to CSR vesicles estimates the concentration of unoccupied binding sites since the direct binding of FKBP is rapid in the cold, whereas the exchange reaction is precluded. We estimate the concentration of unoccupied FKBP12.6 binding sites to be about 4 pmol/mg SR protein (Fig. 1A), whereas the concentration of occupied plus unoccupied binding sites (Bmax) is 23.1 pmol/mg (Fig. 1B). Therefore, in comparison to the 6% unoccupancy calculated for rabbit skeletal muscle TC, 17% of the total FKBP12.6 binding sites in dog CSR vesicles appear to be unoccupied.The time dependence for exchange of either 35S-labeled FKBP12.6 or 35S-labeled FKBP12 with CSR versus SkM SR are compared in Fig. 1C. The inability to label CSR vesicles with appreciable amounts of 35S-labeled FKBP12 is striking in contrast to the other three conditions shown in the figure. Thus, the cardiac CRC does not significantly bind to or exchange with FKBP12, whereas the SkM CRC binds to and exchanges with FKBP12 and FKBP12.6. The specificity of interaction was further investigated by 35S-labeled FKBP displacement curves (Figs. 2). Using the exchange methodology, CSR vesicles were prelabeled with 35S-labeled FKBP12.6, whereas skeletal muscle SR vesicles were prelabeled with 35S-labeled FKBP12. The displacement of the radiolabeled FKBPs, bound to the SR, were then studied at 37°C with increasing concentrations of either: 1) unlabeled FKBP isoforms; 2) unlabeled fusion constructs of GST with either FKBP isoform (i.e. GST/FKBP12 or GST/FKBP12.6); or 3) FK590, an FKBP ligand with similar structural and functional properties as FK506. The displacement curves in Fig. 2A show that 35S-labeled FKBP12.6 is displaced from CSR by FK590, FKBP12.6, or GST/FKBP12.6 with EC50 values in the range of 0.10 to 0.3 µM. However, 10 µM concentrations of either FKBP12 or GST/FKBP12 do not appreciably displace labeled FKBP12.6 from CSR. By contrast, 35S-labeled FKBP12 is displaced from skeletal muscle SR vesicles by all five of the reagents with EC50 values in the range of 0.1 to 1.0 µM (Fig. 2B).Fig. 235S-Labeled FKBP displacement curves from prelabeled cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. A, displacement of 35S-labeled FKBP12.6 from prelabeled CSR. CSR vesicles (2.5 mg/ml) were prelabeled with 35S-labeled FKBP12.6 (25.4 ± 2.4 pmol/mg CSR protein) by the exchange methodology described previously (10Timerman A.P. Wiederrecht G. Marcy A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2451-2459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with the modifications noted under “Experimental Procedures.” The prelabeled CSR were incubated at 37°C for 30 min in the presence of the indicated concentrations of unlabeled: ▪, FKBP12.6; □, GST/FKBP12.6; ▴, FKBP12; ▵, GST/FKBP12; and •, FK590. Following incubation, 35S-labeled FKBP bound to the SR vesicles was determined as described above. The five displacement curves shown in the figure were drawn directly through the data points. Each experiment was performed two times with two different preparations with each point in duplicate, with similar results. B, displacement of 35S-labeled FKBP12 prelabeled SkM SR. SkM SR (R3 fraction) vesicles (2.5 mg/ml) were prelabeled with 35S-labeled FKBP12 (38.0 pmol/mg), and displacement curves were generated as described in A. Each data point is the average of triplicates obtained from a single SR preparation. The displacement curves with FK590 and unlabeled FKBP12 (same symbols as in A) are similar to previously published 35S-labeled FKBP12 displacement curves from prelabeled SkM TC vesicles (10Timerman A.P.

The vesicles were first stripped of their endogenous FKBP by incubation with FK590 as described previously and isolated by centrifugation, which separates the FKBP-stripped vesicles in the pellet from the soluble FKBP·drug complex that remains in the supernatant (5Timerman A.P. Ogunbumni E. Freund E. Wiederrecht G. Marks A.R. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22992-22999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) The binding of FKBP to FKBP-stripped vesicles was then performed in the cold for 3 min, a condition that precludes the exchange phenomenon (Fig. 1A). The bar graph in Fig. 3 shows that FKBP-stripped CSR vesicles bind FKBP12.6 selectively (compare bar 1 versus bar 2). Furthermore, the 35S-labeled FKBP12.6 binding is competed for by unlabeled FKBP12.6 but not unlabeled FKBP12 (Fig. 3, bar 3 versus bar 4). Conversely, FKBP-stripped skeletal muscle TC vesicles bind comparable amounts of either 35S-labeled FKBP12 or 35S-labeled FKBP12.6 (Fig. 3, bars 7 and 8), which are effectively competed for by either unlabeled FKBP (10Timerman A.P.

For measuring binding of 35S-labeled FKBP, FKBP-depleted vesicles (2 mg/ml) were incubated for 3 min on ice with either 2 µM of 35S-labeled FKBP12.6 or 2 µM 35S-labeled FKBP12 in the absence or presence of 40 µM of the unlabeled FKBP12.6 or 40 µM unlabeled FKBP12. Specific binding is total binding − nonspecific binding. For FKBP-depleted CSR, 100% specific binding is defined as specific binding of 35S-labeled FKBP12.6. Nonspecific binding of each isoform was determined in the presence of 20-fold excess unlabeled FKBP. Values for specific versus nonspecific 35S-labeled FKBP12.6 binding were 12.7 ± 0.1 versus 6.7 ± 0.7 pmol/mg, respectively. In contrast, both total and nonspecific binding values for 35S-labeled FKBP12.0 were 15.4 ± 1.8 pmol/mg, i.e. there was no measurable specific binding of 35S-labeled FKBP12.0 to FKBP-depleted CSR. For FKBP-depleted SkM SR, 100% specific binding is defined as specific binding of 35S-labeled FKBP12.0 (61.9 pmol/mg). Again, nonspecific binding for each isoform was determined in the presence of 20-fold excess unlabeled FKBP. Nonspecific binding values for 35S-labeled FKBP12.0 versus 35S-labeled FKBP12.6 were 8.5 and 13.1 pmol/mg, respectively. The data for CSR represent the mean ± S.D. from three different CSR preparations. The data for SkM SR were performed on one preparation.

First, the endogenous FKBP in CSR was replaced (∼85%) with the GST/FKBP12.6 fusion construct using either the dissociation/reconstitution or exchange methodology, with similar results obtained by either method. The experiment shown in Fig. 4 used the exchange methodologies. The mixture of CSR vesicles with excess GST/FKBP was solubilized with CHAPS, and the cardiac CRC·GST/FKBP12.6 complex was affinity purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 4). Fig. 4, lanes 1-4, monitors the purification of RyR-2 as observed by Coomassie Blue stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The protein profiles of CSR (Fig. 4, lane 1) can be compared with the applied sample (Fig. 4, lane 2), which contains the mixture of CHAPS-solubilized SR with excess GST/FKBP12.6. A band referrable to the GST/FKBP12.6 fusion construct (∼40 kDa) is evident in the applied sample which, as expected, is essentially absent in the column flow through (Fig. 4, lane 3). Bands referable to both the GST/FKBP12.6 and RyR-2 are clearly evident in the glutathione eluate (Fig. 4, lane 4). The high molecular weight bands referable to RyR-2 were further identified by Western blot analysis using sequence-specific antiserum raised against RyR-2 (Fig. 4B, lane 4). By contrast, the cardiac CRC is not purified when GST/FKBP12 is used in place of GST/FKBP12.6 (Fig. 4, lanes 5-7), although the GST/FKBP12 construct was clearly adsorbed to and eluted from the column with glutathione (Fig. 4, lane 7). On the other hand, RyR-1 from skeletal muscle TC can be purified using either GST/FKBP12 or GST/FKBP12.6 (16Xin H.B. Timerman A.O. Onoue H. Wiederrecht G.J. Fleischer S. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These studies confirm that: 1) the binding of FKBP to the SR vesicles is specific to the RyR; 2) RyR-2 has specificity for binding FKBP12.6; and 3) RyR-1 binds both FKBP12 and FKBP12.6.Fig. 4Affinity purification of RyR-2 from canine heart SR based upon its specific association with FKBP12.6.

Most of programmed cell death occurs by apoptosis. Apoptotic cell death of lymphocytes can be triggered by ligation of APO-1/Fas (CD95) antigen (Suda, T., and Nagata, S. (1994) J. Exp. Med. 179, 873-879; Nagata, S., and Golstein, P. (1995) Science 267, 1449-1456). We find that activation of Fas leads to the inhibition of the voltage-dependent n-type K+ channels (Kv1.3) studied by patch clamp technique in Jurkat T lymphocytes. Tyrosine kinases have been shown to be crucial in Fas-induced cell death (Eischen, C. M., Dick, C. J., and Leibson, P. J. (1994) J. Immunol. 153, 1947-1954). The inhibition of the current is correlated with the tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated and blotted K+ channel protein. We show, that the Src-like protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A and the deficiency of the p56lck tyrosine kinase in mutant Jurkat cells abolished the channel inhibition and phosphorylation by anti-Fas antibody, while reconstitution of the p56lck kinase partly restored these effects of Fas receptor triggering. These results suggest a regulation of n-type K+ channels by tyrosine kinases upon Fas receptor triggering, which might be important for apoptosis.

These results suggest a regulation of n-type K+ channels by tyrosine kinases upon Fas receptor triggering, which might be important for apoptosis. INTRODUCTIONThe programmed cell death is a process characterized by DNA fragmentation and apoptotic cell morphology. Apoptosis can be triggered by a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic signals, including ligation of APO-1/Fas (CD95) antigen or purified Fas ligand (1Suda T. Nagata S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 2Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar). One of the crucial events in the early phase of Fas-induced apoptosis is the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins (3Eischen C.M. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1947-1954PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of lymphocytes with herbimycin A, an inhibitor of Src-like tyrosine kinases prevents Fas-induced apoptosis (3Eischen C.M. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1947-1954PubMed Google Scholar).Thus far, nothing is known about the possible involvement of ion channels in apoptotic cell death. The present study has been performed to test for an influence of Fas stimulation on ion channel activity. As a result, Fas indeed led to a striking inhibition of n-type K+ channels, the most abundant K+ channels in lymphocytes. To further elucidate the mechanism of this inhibition, we looked for phosphorylation of the channel protein following Fas stimulation. Triggering of the Fas receptor was indeed followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of the channel. In order to evaluate the significance of the phosphorylation for channel inhibition, we have performed studies examining the effect of Fas on n-type K+ channel activity in cells deficient of tyrosine kinase and in the presence of tyrosine kinase inhibitor.In the present study we show that the n-type K+ channels are inhibited upon Fas stimulation of Jurkat T lymphocytes and that the suppression of current is correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation of the channel protein by the p56lck tyrosine kinase.RESULTSPatch clamp experiments were performed to assess the effect of Fas stimulation on macroscopic potassium current and single potassium channel activity in Jurkat human T lymphocytes. As shown in Fig. 1A, whole-cell outward currents, elicited at depolarizing voltages, exhibited kinetics typical for n-type K+ channels (10Matteson D.R. Deutsch C. Nature. 1984; 307: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 11De Coursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S.

According to ion substitution experiments, the current was K+-selective (a shift of reversal potential to 8 ± 6 mV was observed with 140 mM K+ bath medium, n = 4). Furthermore, the current was sensitive to charybdotoxin, a well known inhibitor of voltage-gated K+ channels (14Sands S.B. Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 1061-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells, displaying a stable current in whole-cell configuration for at least 5 min, were used either as time controls (n = 18) or for stimulation (n = 15). Cells were stimulated with a total amount of 1 µg of antibody by perfusing the chamber with 200 ng/ml monoclonal anti-human Fas antibody (anti-Fas) 1The abbreviation used is: anti-Fasmonoclonal anti-human Fas antibody. (n = 10) or with 200 ng/ml polyclonal anti-mouse Fas antibody (n = 5) (Fig. 1B). For time controls, the cells were left untreated (n = 18) (Fig. 1B). On Fig. 1B, zero time corresponds to the beginning of incubation. Stimulation via anti-human Fas treatment resulted in a 46 ± 4% decrease of the whole-cell peak current within 15 min, while incubation of the human cells with anti-mouse Fas antibody caused a 4 ± 2% decrease over the same period (Fig. 1, B and C). Stimulation with anti-CD20 antibody was similarly ineffective (n = 3) (not shown). These latter experiments have been performed in order to test the specificity of anti-human Fas antibody's effect on channel activity. The time course and the extent of the effect of the antibody was independent of whether it was added after 9-12 or 23-25 min of recording in whole-cell configuration. The current significantly decreased for all voltages ≥10 mV (Fig. 1, A and D). The current suppression was not due to changes in the voltage-dependent gating properties of the channel, since the intrinsic voltage sensitivity of the channel was not altered. The inhibition was not reversible within 20 min respective to the end of the stimulation (n = 2). The remaining current after inhibition by the antibody was completely abolished by 50 nM charybdotoxin (n = 3), indicating that the pharmacological properties of the channel were not altered.Inhibition of K+ channels by Fas triggering was also observed at single-channel levels in outside-out patches (Fig. 2A) (n = 3). These experiments indicated that anti-Fas antibody inhibited the whole-cell current by decreasing the open probability of the channels without affecting significantly the single-channel amplitude. Fig. 2B shows representative current traces from an unstimulated patch indicating that the channels' activity was stable (n = 4), while Fig. 2C demonstrates that incubation of a patch with anti-mouse Fas antibody did not alter the channels' open probability (n = 3).Fig. 2Effect of Fas stimulation on activity at the single-channel level. A, outward currents, elicited by 5-s depolarizing steps to 0 mV from −70 mV holding potential at 2-min intervals in an outside-out patch. Upper trace, activity in control condition; lower two traces, activity from the same patch after 6 and 9 min of incubation with 200 ng/ml antibody, respectively. Dashed lines indicate the zero-current level. The open probability (Po) of the channels decreased by 30% and 67%, respectively. The Po was calculated by integrating the current through open channels in a 5-s segment and dividing the integral by the time of recording multiplied by the current through a single channel (1.5 pA) and the total number of channels observed in the patch. B, n-K+ channel activity in a 5-s segment, elicited by the pulse protocol described in A, in control conditions. Upper trace, activity of the first pulse step in an outside-out patch; lower trace, activity from the same patch 12 min later. In this experiment, the open probability of the channel varied between 0.76 and 0.92 during the subsequent depolarizing steps, and the activity showed no rundown. Original traces are representative of 4 similar experiments. C, outward currents, elicited by the pulse protocol described in A, in control condition (upper trace) and after 18 min of incubation with anti-mouse Fas antibody (lower trace), from the same patch. No decrease in the channels' open probability could be observed during the experiment (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To gain insight into the mechanism of the inhibition of the n-type K+ channel, we examined whether the suppression of the current is correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation of the K+ channel protein. Immunoprecipitation and blotting of the Kv1.3 channel protein from Jurkat cells revealed tyrosine phosphorylation of the 65-kDa n-type K+ channel protein following stimulation of the cells via Fas (Fig. 3A). Tyrosine phosphorylation was observed for at least 20 min.Fig. 3Kv1.3 channel protein is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon Fas stimulation. A: upper panel, tyrosine phosphorylation of the 65-kDa Kv1.3 protein after incubation of Jurkat cells with anti-Fas antibody for the indicated times; lower panel, stripping and reprobing the blot with anti-Kv1.3 antiserum reveals similar protein amounts in all lanes.

B: upper panel, tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated and blotted channel protein in Jurkat, herbimycin A (10 µM)-treated Jurkat (HA), JCaM 1.6 (JCaM), and p56lck-reconstituted JCaM 1.6 (JCaM+lck) cells after incubation with anti-Fas antibody for the indicated times; lower panel, similar concentrations of proteins were loaded in all lanes, as shown by stripping and reprobing the blot with anti-Kv1.3 antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Herbimycin A (10 µM), an inhibitor of the Src-like tyrosine kinases known to inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis, prevented tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv1.3 protein (Fig. 3B). Likewise, herbimycin A attenuated the inhibition of the whole-cell n-type K+ current by anti-human Fas in Jurkat cells (Fig. 3B).Since p56lck is the main non-receptor, membrane-bound Src-like tyrosine kinase in Jurkat T cells, we tested for Fas-induced n-type K+ channel suppression in p56lck-deficient Jurkat cells (JCaM 1.6) (4Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). As illustrated on Fig. 3B, tyrosine phosphorylation of the channel protein was completely absent in JCaM 1.6 cells. Moreover, the reconstitution of these cells with p56lck restored tyrosine phosphorylation of the channel protein upon Fas stimulation. Western blot analyses (Fig. 3, A and B, lower panels) indicated that the differences in the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation in the various cell lines was not simply due to different Kv1.3 protein concentrations in the immunoprecipitates.The lack of tyrosine phosphorylation of n-type K+ channels in JCaM 1.6 cells following exposure to anti-human Fas is paralleled by the near complete absence of n-type K+ channel inhibition after Fas receptor stimulation (Fig. 4, A and B). However, the n-type K+ channels in JCaM 1.6 cells were still inhibited by 20 nM charybdotoxin (Fig. 4A) showing that genetic deficiency in p56lck kinase did not alter the channels' properties. Finally, reconstitution of p56lck into JCaM 1.6 cells partially restored the inhibitory effect of anti-human Fas (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Herbimycin A or genetic deficiency of p56lck tyrosine kinase prevents Fas-induced inhibition of n-type K+ channels.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the p56lck tyrosine kinase deficiency and tyrosine kinase inhibition almost abolish the inhibitory effect of Fas on the channel. Even though the lack of p56lck kinase activity completely prevented tyrosine phosphorylation as revealed by phosphorylation analysis, the Fas-induced channel inhibition was not completely abolished. These results suggest that direct tyrosine phosphorylation of the channel by p56lck tyrosine kinase and/or by a downstream tyrosine kinase accounts for suppression of channel activity; however, an additional mechanism may operate as well to inhibit the n-type channel following Fas stimulation.The shaker-family member Kv1.2 channels, that show high a degree of homology with Kv1.3 (15Pongs O. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S69-S88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are known to be down-regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (16Huang X.Y. Morielly A.D. Peralta E.G.

Similarly, phosphorylation of the n-type K+ channels in Jurkat cells by protein kinases A and C result in suppression of the current (6Payet M.D. Dupuis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18270-18273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The n-type voltage-gated K+ channels have been shown to be responsible for the maintenance of the resting membrane potential in lymphocytes, since their inhibition by the specific inhibitors margatoxin and noxiustoxin (18Garcia-Calvo M.

Reuben J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Changes in membrane potential seems to be an early and important event upon mitogenic stimulation of lymphocytes (21Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Rink T.J. Nature. 1982; 295: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). T cell activation selectively increases the number of n-type K+ channels (22De Coursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. J. Neuroimmunol. 1985; 10: 71-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which might in part lead to the hyperpolarization observed by Tsien et al. (21Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Rink T.J. Nature. 1982; 295: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Margatoxin- and noxiustoxin-induced depolarization blocks proliferation and lymphokine production in T lymphocytes by affecting the Ca2+-dependent pathways involved in proliferation (23Lin C.S. Boltz R.C. Blake J.T. Nguyen M. Talento A. Fischer P.A. Springer M.S. Sigal N.H. Slaughter R.S. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Koo G.C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).The n-type K+ channels are involved in the regulatory volume decrease (24Grinstein S. Smith J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25Deutsch C. Chen L.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10036-10040Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) as well. Their activation leads to shrinkage. Volume regulation might be prevented by inhibition of the n-type K+ channels in lymphocytes.We suggest that changes in membrane potential might be important in apoptosis. This idea is supported by our observation in which the rate of apoptotic death, measured by DNA degradation, is slightly but significantly increased (10 ± 3%) when cells were incubated with anti-human Fas antibody and margatoxin together, compared to the cell death in the case of incubation with anti-human Fas alone. Since n-type K+ channels have been implied in volume regulatory decrease as well, their inhibition might regulate cell volume, which in turn might interfere with the apoptotic pathway. The exact mechanism by which inhibition of n-type K+ channels might influence apoptosis and the signal transduction pathway however is still unknown. Furthermore, Fas triggering might regulate other ion channels as well, a possibility currently being investigated in our laboratory. INTRODUCTIONThe programmed cell death is a process characterized by DNA fragmentation and apoptotic cell morphology. Apoptosis can be triggered by a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic signals, including ligation of APO-1/Fas (CD95) antigen or purified Fas ligand (1Suda T. Nagata S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 2Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar). One of the crucial events in the early phase of Fas-induced apoptosis is the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins (3Eischen C.M. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1947-1954PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of lymphocytes with herbimycin A, an inhibitor of Src-like tyrosine kinases prevents Fas-induced apoptosis (3Eischen C.M. Dick C.J. Leibson P.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1947-1954PubMed Google Scholar).Thus far, nothing is known about the possible involvement of ion channels in apoptotic cell death. The present study has been performed to test for an influence of Fas stimulation on ion channel activity. As a result, Fas indeed led to a striking inhibition of n-type K+ channels, the most abundant K+ channels in lymphocytes. To further elucidate the mechanism of this inhibition, we looked for phosphorylation of the channel protein following Fas stimulation. Triggering of the Fas receptor was indeed followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of the channel. In order to evaluate the significance of the phosphorylation for channel inhibition, we have performed studies examining the effect of Fas on n-type K+ channel activity in cells deficient of tyrosine kinase and in the presence of tyrosine kinase inhibitor.In the present study we show that the n-type K+ channels are inhibited upon Fas stimulation of Jurkat T lymphocytes and that the suppression of current is correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation of the channel protein by the p56lck tyrosine kinase."

We have investigated the role of this pathway in promoting survival of primary sympathetic neurons that die when deprived of NGF. NGF caused rapid and sustained increases (approximately 4-fold) in the activities of the ERK-1 and ERK-2 isoforms of MAP kinase. PD 098059, an inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase activation, blocked the effects of NGF on both kinase isoforms. However, PD 098059 did not attenuate the effects of NGF on neuronal survival. In addition, MAP kinase activity was not increased by chlorophenylthio-cAMP, a cell-permeable analog of cAMP that supports neuronal survival in the absence of NGF.

During development, neurons that fail to obtain a sufficient amount of NGF from target or other tissues die. In the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), naturally occurring cell death results in a loss of 50% of the sympathetic neurons (3Wright L.L. Cunningham T.J. Smolen A.J. J.

Most of our knowledge of NGF signaling is based on experiments with PC12 cells, a cell line derived from a rat pheochromocytoma (9Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Using neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells as a measure of differentiation, studies have implicated the MAP kinase pathway in NGF signaling. NGF binds to and activates the tyrosine kinase of TrkA, the high affinity NGF receptor (12Kaplan D.R. Martin-Zanca D. Parada L.F.

The cAMP analog, chlorophenylthio-cAMP (CPTcA), supports the complete survival of SCG neurons in the absence of NGF (29Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 30Edwards S.N. Buckmaster A.E. Tolkovsky A.M. J.

In PC12 cells, a direct link exists between the cAMP and NGF signaling pathways. Derivatives of cAMP induce the sprouting of short neuritic processes (32Schubert D.S. LaCorbiere M. Whitlock C. Stallcup W. Nature. 1978; 273: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and potentiate the neurite outgrowth induced by NGF (33Gunning P.W. Landreth G.E. Bothwell M.A. Shooter E.M. J.

Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 916-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recently it was demonstrated that cAMP analogues increase MAP kinase activity in PC12 cells (35Frödin M. Peraldi P. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6207-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Young S.W. Dickens M. Tavare J.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and potentiate NGF activation of MAP kinase (35Frödin M. Peraldi P. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6207-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that cAMP potentiates NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells by activating MAP kinase.The pathways mediating neuronal differentiation may differ from those involved in NGF-dependent survival. In a differentiated PC12 cell model, overexpression of MEK supports PC12 cell survival in the absence of NGF, suggesting that this pathway may be important for neuronal survival (37Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). Although the PC12 cell model offers distinct advantages for studying NGF signaling, PC12 cells are transformed and may not be representative of postmitotic neurons in all respects. Thus, primary sympathetic neurons represent a better model for investigating signaling events important for neuronal survival. The present experiments were performed to investigate the role of MAP kinase in the actions of CPTcA and NGF on the survival of primary sympathetic neurons derived from the superior cervical ganglion.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONNGF increased MAP kinase activity in SCG neurons (Fig. 1). The maximum effect represented a 4-fold increase and was observed at 10 nM NGF. Significant activation of MAP kinase was observed at concentrations as low as 0.1 nM NGF. Neuronal survival decreases markedly below 0.05 nM NGF. 2D. J. Creedon, E. M. Johnson, Jr., and J. C. Lawrence, Jr., unpublished observations. Thus, the concentrations of NGF that increased MBP kinase activity were within the range of concentrations that support neuronal survival. The effects of NGF on activating MAP kinase were rapidly reversible. Within 30 min of removing NGF, MBP kinase activity fell to a stable plateau that was approximately 25% of maximal activity (Fig. 2). This fall in MBP kinase activity precedes many of the biochemical alterations that have been identified in NGF-deprived neurons (31Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). However, if the MAP kinase pathway is important for neuronal survival, then the residual activity observed after removing NGF is insufficient to support neuronal survival since all such neurons die via apoptosis within 48-72 h (31Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 44Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J.

The small number of nonneuronal cells in the cultures might account for some of this basal activity, although the number of such cells was minimized by adding the anti-mitotics, fluorodeoxyuridine and aphidicolin, to the culture medium. Based on cell counts, nonneuronal cells represented only 5-10% of the cultured cells. The NGF-stimulated activity was clearly associated with neurons, because NGF failed to increase MAP kinase activity in cultures in which the neurons had been eliminated by treatment with anti-NGF for 48 h.2Fig. 2Time course of the reversal of the effects of NGF on MBP kinase activity. Neurons were incubated with NGF (2 nM) for 6 days. The cells were then rinsed and incubated for increasing times in medium containing NGF antibody before MBP kinase activity was measured. Mean values ± half the range of two experiments are presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast to NGF, CPTcA (500 µM) did not activate MAP kinase in SCG neurons, even after prolonged incubation (Fig. 3). By comparison, NGF (2 nM) increased activity by 4-fold within 5 min and activity was maintained after 24 h. Neurons deprived of NGF for up to 18 h can be rescued from cell death by adding either NGF or CPTcA; after 25 h of NGF deprivation, less than 40% of the neurons can be rescued by NGF or CPTcA treatment (30Edwards S.N. Buckmaster A.E. Tolkovsky A.M. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 2140-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 31Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Thus, CPTcA rescues NGF-deprived SCG neurons with a time course very similar to that of NGF. To confirm that CPTcA promoted neuronal survival under conditions of the present experiments, 6-day neuronal cultures were deprived of NGF for 12 h and then treated with NGF or CPTcA for 5 days (Fig. 4). No neurons were found in the cultures incubated without NGF or CPTcA (Fig. 4b). However, neurons that received either NGF (Fig. 4a) or CPTcA (Fig. 4c) exhibited phase-bright cell bodies and extensive neuritic networks characteristic of viable neurons.Fig. 3Time course of MBP kinase activation by NGF, CPTcA, and PMA. Six-day neuronal cultures were deprived of NGF for 12 h. The cells were then incubated for increasing times with NGF (2 nM), CPTcA (500 µM), or PMA (1 µM) before MBP kinase activity was measured.

To address this point, neuronal cultures were treated with the phorbol ester, PMA, which activates the MAP kinase pathway in many cell types (19Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 27Szeberényi J. Erhardt P. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2105-2113PubMed Google Scholar, 35Frödin M. Peraldi P.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). PMA (1 µM) transiently increased the MBP kinase activity in SCG neurons (Fig. 3). However, as observed previously (46Martin D.P. Ito A. Horigome K. Lampe P.A. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 1205-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), PMA did not maintain NGF-deprived neurons.2Measurements of MBP phosphorylation in extracts reflect the activities of the ERK-1 and ERK-2 isoforms of MAP kinase (and possibly other kinases). To investigate the possibility that CPTcA selectively activated one of the MAP kinase isoforms, ERK-1 and ERK-2 activities were assessed by using an in-gel assay. Two major MBP kinases were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5a). The apparent molecular weights (44,000 and 42,000) corresponded to the expected sizes of ERK-1 and ERK-2, respectively (47Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments with specific antibodies confirmed the assignment of these bands as ERK-1 and ERK-2.2 NGF markedly increased the activities of both ERK-1 (Fig. 5b) and ERK-2 (Fig. 5c). In contrast, CPTcA increased the activity of neither isoform. CPTcA appeared to enhance the effect of NGF slightly on increasing ERK-1 activity, but it had no effect on the stimulation of ERK-2 by NGF. CPTcA was also without effect on the activation of ERK-1 and ERK-2 by PMA.Fig. 5Effect of NGF and CPTcA on the ERK-1 and ERK-2 isoforms of MAP kinase. Six-day neuronal cultures were deprived of NGF for 12 h, then treated for 5 min as indicated. Cellular homogenates were subjected to electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.33 mg/ml MBP. After electrophoresis, MAP kinases were renatured and the gel was incubated in reaction mixture containing [γ-32P]ATP. After extensive washing, the gel was dried. An autoradiogram is presented (A).

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6207-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In SCG neurons, CPTcA alone activated neither ERK-1 nor ERK-2 and caused only a slight potentiation of ERK-1 activity in neurons treated with both cAMP and NGF (Fig. 5, b and c). Although the reason the response to CPTcA differs in sympathetic neurons and PC12 cells is not clear, different responses may even occur in different subclones of PC12 cells. Vaillancourt et al.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10300-10304Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), increasing cAMP actually decreases the activation of MAP kinase activity. Activated cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates Raf-1 and B-Raf, inhibiting both Ras-Raf interactions and Raf kinase activity (52Hafner S. Adler H.C. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G.

Filloux C. Calothy G. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Regardless of the mechanisms involved, the differences between the effects of cAMP on MAP kinase in PC12 cells and SCG neurons underscore the importance of not relying solely on the PC12 model to define the mechanisms of action of neurotrophins.To test the possibility that neuronal survival is enhanced through activation of a subcellular pool of MAP kinase that is not detected in assays of cell extracts, control neurons and cells that had been treated with CPTcA or NGF were immunostained with an antibody that recognizes only the active phosphorylated form of MAP kinase. Six-day neuronal cultures were deprived of NGF for 12 h, then treated with NGF, CPTcA, or no additions, and fixed for immunostaining 60 or 180 min after treatment. No phospho-MAP kinase staining was detected in control (Fig. 6, a and b) or CPTcA-treated cultures (Fig. 6, c and d). In contrast, NGF-treated neurons were stained throughout the neurites and cell bodies (Fig. 6, e and f). Similar staining patterns were observed both 60 and 180 min after treatment. This pattern of staining is distinct from that seen in cells treated with mitotic growth factors in which MAP kinase translocates to the nucleus (54Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pages G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The diffuse staining in neurons may reflect the sustained activation of MAP kinase after NGF treatment. The lack of positive staining for phospho-MAP kinase in CPTcA-treated cultures provides additional evidence that CPTcA did not produce significant activation of MAP kinase in SCG neurons and argues strongly against the possibility that CPTcA activated a particular subcellular pool of MAP kinase.Fig. 6Phospho-MAP kinase antibodies stain NGF, but not control or CPTcA-treated SCG neurons. Six-day neuronal cultures were deprived of NGF for 12 h, then treated with no additions, 2 nM NGF, or 500 µM CPTcA. Neurons were fixed 3 h after treatment and stained with a phospho-specific MAP kinase antibody. Phase-contrast (a, c, and e) and corresponding immunofluorescent (b, d, and f) images reveal that control (a and b), and CPTcA-treated (c and d) neurons contain no detectable phospho-MAP kinase, whereas in NGF-treated (e and f) cultures, the neuronal cell bodies and processes are stained. A similar staining pattern was seen in cultures fixed 1 h after treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The failure of CPTcA to increase MAP kinase activity in SCG neurons does not mean that the MAP kinase pathway was not necessary for NGF-mediated neuronal survival. To investigate this possibility, we assessed the effect of the MEK inhibitor, PD 098059 (55Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

PD 098059 caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the activation of both ERK-1 and ERK-2 by NGF (Fig. 7a). The amount of activity that remained after treatment with 100 µM PD 098059 (lane 5) was comparable to that seen in either control (NGF-deprived) cultures (lane 1) or cultures treated with 500 nM K252a (lane 6), a Trk inhibitor that causes neuronal cell death indistinguishable from that produced by NGF deprivation (57Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1989; 96: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 58Knusel B. Hefti F. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1987-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 59Borasio G.D.

PD 098059 also blocked the increase in MAP kinase staining after NGF treatment.2Fig. 7PD 098059 inhibits NGF-induced activation of ERK-1 and ERK-2, but does not block neuronal survival. a, in-gel kinase assays of 6-day neuronal cultures that were deprived of NGF for 12 h, incubated for 30 min with either PD 098059 or K252a as indicated, then incubated with 2 nM NGF. b, cultures were deprived of NGF for 12 h and incubated with 100 µM PD 098059 (stippled bars) for 30 min before adding back control medium or NGF. During the next 24 h, the medium was replaced every 6 h with medium containing fresh PD 098059 to maintain MEK inhibition. PD 098059 was then removed, and the cultures were incubated with NGF to rescue any neurons that were not committed to die. After 2 days, the surviving neurons were fixed and counted. The data represent the mean ± S.E. of three wells from a single experiment. Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Neurons deprived of NGF can be rescued if NGF is added after 12 h. If NGF is added after 18 h, approximately 80% of the neurons can be rescued; however, if NGF is added after 36 h, essentially none of the neurons survive (30Edwards S.N. Buckmaster A.E. Tolkovsky A.M. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 2140-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 31Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1207-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Based on this time course, a three-stage paradigm was used to investigate the effect of MEK inhibition on neuronal survival. In stage 1, SCG cultures were deprived of NGF for 12 h to initiate the cell death program. In stage 2, cells were incubated without or with 100 µM PD 098059 for 30 min. NGF was then added to half of the cultures, and the cells were incubated for 24 h. To ensure that MEK inhibition was maintained during this period, the medium was replaced every 6 h with medium containing fresh inhibitor. Control experiments indicated that a single addition of 100 µM PD 098059 inhibited MAP kinase activation for at least 8 h.2 In stage 3, NGF was added to all the cultures to rescue neurons that were not committed to die. The numbers of surviving neurons were counted after an additional 2 days in culture. Essentially all the neurons that did not receive NGF in stage 2 died (Fig. 7b). In contrast, neurons that received NGF in stage 2 survived, even those incubated with PD 098059 (Fig. 7b).The results with PD 098059 indicate that MAP kinase activation was not required for neuronal survival stimulated by NGF. CPTcA also appeared to promote survival independently of the MAP kinase signaling pathway as the cyclic nucleotide derivative increased neither ERK-1 nor ERK-2 activity (Fig. 5). Interestingly, several lines of evidence indicate that Ras, an upstream element of the MAP kinase signaling pathway, is part of the survival pathway for both these agents. Chicken sensory neurons survive and extend neurites in the absence of NGF if isolated by mechanical dissociation in the presence of activated T-24 Ras (60Borasio G.D. John J. Wittinghofer A. Barde Y.-A. Sendtner M. Heumann R. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1087-1096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Microinjection of Y13-259, a neutralizing Ras antibody, or dissociation in the presence of Y13-259 Fab fragments blocks the survival of chicken sensory neurons (61Borasio G.D. Markus A. Wittinghofer A. Barde Y.-A. Heumann R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) or rat SCG neurons (62Nobes C.D. Tolkovsky A.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) maintained in NGF. Dissociation of rat sympathetic neurons in the presence of Ras antibodies also blocks CPTcA-mediated neuronal survival (62Nobes C.D. Tolkovsky A.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This issue is further complicated, however, by the observation that a dominant negative Ras prevents apoptosis of PC12 cells (63Ferrari G. Greene L.A.

https://openalex.org/W1987274954,"Tyk2 and JAK1, members of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of protein tyrosine kinases, are required for interferon-α/β binding and signaling. Both enzymes are associated with the interferon-α/β receptor, and upon ligand binding, they undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and catalytic activation in an interdependent manner. To identify residues involved in Tyk2 regulation and to understand the basis of the interdependence of Tyk2 and JAK1, six mutated versions of Tyk2 bearing single or multiple point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain were studied in a cell line lacking endogenous Tyk2. The Y1054F/Y1055F substitutions in the putative activation loop prevented ligand-dependent activation of Tyk2, without abolishing its catalytic potential. The K930R mutation in the ATP binding site generated a kinase-negative protein, which however, still became phosphorylated upon interferon-α treatment. The Y1054F/Y1055F substitutions in this kinase-negative Tyk2 abolished the induced phosphorylation. These results indicate that Tyk2 is activated by phosphorylation on Tyr-1054 and/or Tyr-1055 and that this phosphorylation requires another kinase, most likely JAK1. While the Tyk2 forms mutated on Tyr-1054 and Tyr-1055 or on Lys-930 allowed some inducible gene expression, the combination of the three point mutations totally abolished signaling.

The JAKs play a crucial role in signaling through cytokine receptors, as was first demonstrated by their ability to complement the genetic defect of mutant cell lines unresponsive to interferons (IFN); it was later found that ligand binding to almost all known cytokine receptors induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of one or more JAK family members. The physical association of these enzymes with a number of receptor chains was also demonstrated, and deletions or mutations abolishing this interaction were found to inactivate signaling (for recent reviews, see Refs. 8Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar and 9Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized cytokine signaling pathways is the one triggered by IFN-α/β. The involvement in this pathway of two JAKs, Tyk2 and JAK1, was well established through the study of the IFN-α unresponsive human mutant cell lines 11,1 and U4, lacking Tyk2 and JAK1, respectively (10Velazquez L.

Both kinases have been shown to physically interact with components of the IFN-α/β receptor complex (12Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. J.

Moreover, a functional receptor requires the presence of the two kinases, as shown by the IFN-α binding defect of 11,1 and U4 cells (11Müller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A.

We have recently reported that both the amino-terminal region and the KL domain of Tyk2 are required to restore high affinity binding sites for IFN-α in 11,1 cells, but that there are some dynamic characteristics of the binding which require the TK domain (19Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3327-3334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Whether the presence of the TK domain or rather the enzymatic activity of Tyk2 is required to reconstitute a fully active receptor/ligand complex is unknown. IFN-α/β treatment induces tyrosine phosphorylation and enzymatic activation of both JAK1 and Tyk2 (11Müller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G.

Once activated, the JAKs initiate the IFN-α/β signaling cascade, whose known steps are the phosphorylation of the receptor chains (21Platanias L.C. Uddin S. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol.

Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the activity of the JAKs as measured in vitro correlates, in the intact cell, with an increase in their level of tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting, as for most receptor and nonreceptor protein kinases, that the activity of these enzymes is modulated by their relative level of phosphorylation. Several details remain, however, to be clarified: 1) the identification of the tyrosine residues critical for kinase activation/inhibition; 2) the precise nature of the activating step, whether a conformational change and/or the juxtaposition of the kinases brought about by the ligand-driven receptor chain clustering; and 3) the spatial and temporal order of events and the precise role of each individual JAK protein. To address some of these questions, we have generated and studied six mutant forms of Tyk2 bearing single or multiple mutations in the TK domain. All mutant forms have been stably expressed in the Tyk2-deficient 11,1 cell line and the IFN-α response analyzed. Here we show that Tyk2 enzymatic activity is regulated by phosphorylation at Tyr-1054 and/or Tyr-1055 in the activation loop and that, in response to IFN-α in the intact cell, this event is dependent on the induced activity of another kinase, most likely JAK1. The mutant cell line 11,1 (also called U1A) was described previously (18Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 250 µg/ml hygromycin.

Resistant colonies were ring-cloned 2 weeks later and expanded. Survival in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine (HAT) medium was assayed in the presence of different concentrations of Wellferon, a highly purified mixture of human IFN-α subtypes (108 IU/mg of protein, Wellcome Research Laboratories) (24Allen G.

Mutagenized fragments were reintroduced into pRc-Tyk2, and the final constructs were sequenced (Sequenase kit, U. S.

The K930R/Y1054F/Y1055F mutant was obtained by substituting a 2.3-kilobase pair BssHII fragment from pRc-Y1054F/Y1055F into pRc-K930R. Total RNA was extracted from subconfluent cultures with guanidium thiocyanate (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Both antibodies were raised against a GST fusion protein containing amino acids 289-451 of human Tyk2. The JAK1 antiserum was a gift of A. Ziemiecki. The anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Preparation of cellular extracts, immunoprecipitations, and immunoblottings were carried out essentially as described previously (19Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uzé G.

An ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Corp.) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the in vitro kinase assay, anti-Tyk2 immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 400 mM NaCl, once in kinase buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2), and resuspended in kinase buffer containing 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.). 1 µg of a GST fusion protein containing the entire cytoplasmic region of human IFNAR1 (GST-IFNAR1cyt) was added to the reaction as an exogenous substrate. The GST-IFNAR1cyt construct was a gift from L. Ling. Phosphorylated products were resolved on a 7% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to Hybond-C Super membrane (Amersham Corp.), visualized by autoradiography, and quantitated by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Four single point mutations and one double mutation were generated within the TK domain or the carboxyl-terminal tail of Tyk2 (Fig. 1). In mutant K930R the invariant lysine of the ATP binding site within subdomain II of the TK domain (28Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) was substituted with an arginine. In the other four mutants, tyrosine residues were replaced with phenylalanines. Tyrosines at positions 1054 and 1055, replaced in mutant Y1054F/Y1055F, lie in the so-called activation loop, which in most PTKs contains well established sites of regulatory phosphorylation (28Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 29Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Tyr-1068 (mutant Y1068F) is in subdomain VIII, within a FWY motif conserved in the JAK family and divergent from the generally found PTK motif (K/RWM/T). The tyrosine residue at position 1145 is within the sequence YHLM, which resembles YXXM, the optimal binding site for the SH2 domain of the p85 subunit of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (30Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Shaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). Lastly, we mutated Tyr-1176, whose location in the Tyk2 tail recalls the carboxyl-terminal Tyr of the Src family PTKs (e.g. Tyr-527 of pp60c-src). When phosphorylated, this site regulates negatively the kinase activity of Src-like enzymes (31Kmiecik T.E. Johnson P.J. Shalloway D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4541-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Cartwright C.A. Eckhart W. Simon S. Kaplan P.L. Cell. 1987; 49: 83-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The wild-type (wt) and the mutant cDNAs, cloned in the pRc/CMV-neo expression vector, were stably transfected in the Tyk2-deficient cell line 11,1. Tyk2 expression level was analyzed by Western blot in independent neomycin-resistant (neor) clones arising from each transfection. Clones expressing comparable levels of Tyk2 protein were chosen for further studies. We first tested the effect of the different point mutations on the in vivo phosphorylation state and the enzymatic activity of Tyk2. Cells expressing the wt or the mutated proteins were left untreated or treated with IFN-α, and Tyk2 immunoprecipitates were either analyzed by blotting with antibodies against phosphotyrosine or subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. The level of phosphorylation and the kinase activity of wt Tyk2 and mutants Y1145F, Y1176F (Fig. 2), and Y1068F (data not shown) were all comparably increased in response to IFN-α. Although in this experiment the in vivo phosphorylation of mutant Y1176F is barely detectable in noninduced cells, further analysis confirmed a basal level of phosphorylation comparable to the wt protein. In contrast, the in vivo phosphorylation state of the Y1054F/Y1055F mutant protein was unchanged by IFN-α addition (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). In vitro, the basal autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate, here a GST fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic region of IFNAR1 (GST-IFNARcyt) (33Colamonici O. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K. Krolewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8133-8142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), could not be enhanced by IFN-α treatment (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). Similar results were obtained for two other Y1054F/Y1055F transfectants expressing different amounts of the mutated protein (data not shown). These data suggest that phosphorylation of Tyr-1054 and/or Tyr-1055 occurs upon IFN-α treatment and is responsible for the enzymatic activation of wt Tyk2. Quantitation of the data presented in Fig. 3B showed that the auto- and substrate-phosphorylation activity of mutant Y1054F/Y1055F was half of the activity of the wt protein in noninduced cells. The K930R mutant, bearing a mutation in the ATP binding site, is catalytically inactive (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6). This protein is not basally phosphorylated, while the wt and the Y1054F/Y1055F proteins are (Fig. 3A), suggesting that autophosphorylation is responsible for the basal level of phosphorylation. On the other hand, the K930R protein becomes phosphorylated upon IFN treatment while the phosphorylation of the Y1054F/Y1055F protein does not change (Fig. 3A), indicating that another kinase is responsible, at least in part, for the IFN-induced phosphorylation. To confirm that this induced phosphorylation occurs on tyrosines 1054 and/or 1055, we constructed a triple Tyk2 mutant, containing the K930R and the Y1054F/Y1055F substitutions. Clones expressing levels of the K930R/Y1054F/Y1055F protein comparable to that of the other transfectants were analyzed for the in vivo phosphorylation state of the protein. As predicted, no basal nor induced phosphorylation of this mutant form could be detected (Fig. 4). We next addressed the question of whether these mutated proteins were able to sustain a response to IFN-α. We tested the ability of all transfectants to grow in HAT selective medium in the presence of increasing concentrations of IFN-α. As reported previously, this medium constitutes a sensitive biological assay for IFN-α signaling (18Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 19Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3327-3334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Whereas wt Tyk2-expressing cells grew with 100 IU/ml IFN-α, cells expressing the Y1054F/Y1055F or the K930R mutant required at least a 25-fold higher concentration (Fig. 5A). Unexpectedly, none of the four clones analyzed expressing the K930R/Y1054F/Y1055F mutant could survive at any dose of IFN-α. Transfectants expressing Y1068F, Y1145F, and Y1176F exhibited a wild-type behavior (data not shown). As a measure of the IFN-α response in the Y1054F/Y1055F and in the K930R transfectants, we also studied the transcriptional induction of the endogenous IFN responsive 6-16 gene by Northern blot. A dose-response analysis of the accumulation of the 6-16 transcript in wt-, Y1054F/Y1055F- and K930R-expressing cells is shown in Fig. 5B. Accumulation of the 6-16 transcript was detectable in Y1054F/Y1055F and K930R transfectants after IFN-α treatment, but strongly reduced when compared with wt Tyk2-expressing cells. Quantitation of this and other similar experiments showed that in K930R and Y1054F/Y1055F transfectants treated with 1000 IU/ml IFN-α, the level of 6-16 mRNA is approximately one-third of the level in cells expressing the wt protein treated with 10 IU/ml. This was confirmed for another inducible mRNA, guanylate-binding protein. As expected from their lack of survival in HAT plus IFN-α medium, the K930R/Y1054F/Y1055F transfectants did not induce gene expression (data not shown). It has been previously suggested that a functional interdependence exists between Tyk2 and JAK1 (11Müller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G. Witthuhn B.A. Schindler C. Pellegrini S. Wilks A.F. Ihle J.N. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 19Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3327-3334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore we monitored the in vivo phosphorylation of JAK1 in the K930R and the Y1054F/Y1055F transfectants. For each mutant, four neor clones were analyzed. No evident change in the basal phosphorylation state of JAK1 was observed when comparing the various transfectants and no detectable enhancement of phosphorylation occurred in K930R- and K930R/Y1054F/Y1055F-expressing cells in response to IFN. On the other hand, in Y1054F/Y1055F-expressing cells, induced JAK1 phosphorylation was seen, although reduced compared to wt cells (Fig. 6). These results suggest that, upon ligand binding, the basal kinase activity exhibited by the Y1054F/Y1055F mutant contributes to JAK1 phosphorylation. In this study we have analyzed the role of TK domain tyrosine residues in Tyk2 activation and signaling. We have found that single replacement of Tyr-1068, Tyr-1145, or Tyr-1176 with phenylalanine did not affect the phosphorylation state and the enzymatic activity of the protein. Furthermore, no change in the IFN-induced gene expression was observed in these transfectants compared with wt transfectants. These results suggest that such tyrosine residues are not targets of regulatory phosphorylation. The finding that substitution of Tyr-1176 in the carboxyl tail of Tyk2 does not affect the regulation of Tyk2 is a posteriori not surprising considering that the equivalent phosphorylated Tyr-527 in pp60c-src represses enzyme activity by intramolecularly interacting with the SH2 domain (34Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), and no such domain is present in Tyk2. Furthermore, no tyrosine equivalent to Tyr-1176 in Tyk2 is found in other members of the JAK family. Replacement of the tyrosine residues 1054 and 1055 with phenylalanine in Tyk2 reduces basal catalytic activity and, more importantly, abolishes the IFN-dependent activation of the protein (Fig. 3). Tyr-1054 and Tyr-1055 lie within the so-called “activation loop” of subdomain VII, a region conserved among individual members of different protein kinase families (28Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 29Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and absent in the KL domain of JAKs. Virtually all known PTKs, with the exception of the Csk family, contain from one to three tyrosine residues in this loop and their phosphorylation positively regulates enzymatic activity. The recent determination of the crystal structure of the inactive insulin receptor kinase domain has shown that the activation loop, unphosphorylated, is engaged in the active site and precludes the access of ATP. Phosphorylation in trans of Tyr-1162, one of three well established sites of ligand-induced autophosphorylation present in this loop, would disengage it from the active site, stabilize the enzyme in an active conformation, and allow access of ATP and substrate (35Wilden P.A. Kahn C.R. Siddle K. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16660-16668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 372: 746-753Crossref Scopus (962) Google Scholar). From our data it appears clear that an absolute requisite for ligand-dependent enhanced Tyk2 kinase activity is the phosphorylation of Tyr-1054 and/or Tyr-1055. As proposed for the insulin receptor kinase, these phosphorylated sites could interact with positively charged conserved amino acids, such as the Arg-1022, within the HRDL motif, or the Lys-1045 and stabilize the regulatory loop in a noninhibitory conformation. Our data show that in vivo another kinase is responsible (at least in part) for the IFN induced Tyr1054 and/or Tyr1055 phosphorylation. In fact, the kinase inactive K930R protein can be phosphorylated, albeit weakly, upon IFN addition, while the Y1054F/Y1055F (and the triple mutant) cannot. The finding that the induced phosphorylation of K930R is weaker than that of the wt protein (Fig. 3A) can be ascribed to lack of autophosphorylation and/or impaired trans-phosphorylation by the other kinase. While it would be rather difficult to evaluate the relative contribution of each of these two events, the absence of Tyk2 phosphorylation in the presence of a kinase inactive JAK1 (see below) suggests an order of events whereby the initiating step toward Tyk2 phosphorylation, and activation, is JAK1-mediated. Interestingly, for a number of other PTKs, phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the activation loop has been shown to rely on a distinct kinase. Focal adhesion kinase and ZAP-70 are intracellular tyrosine kinases, evolutionarily close to Tyk2, possessing two equivalent adjacent tyrosines. Maximal kinase activity of focal adhesion kinase requires phosphorylation of these two residues, most likely by a recruited Src family enzyme (37Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In ZAP-70, a Syk family member required for T cell development and T cell antigen receptor function, mutation of one of the two adjacent tyrosines abolishes further phosphorylation events and receptor function. As for focal adhesion kinase, phosphorylation of this residue appears to depend on another kinase, Lck. In fact ZAP-70 is unable to autophosphorylate in vitro on this site, while addition of Lck in the assay results in its phosphorylation (38Wange R.L. Guitián R. Isakov N. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18730-18733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 39Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We have not determined whether one or both tyrosine residues need to be phosphorylated in order to activate Tyk2. A thorough study of the effect of replacing either one or both adjacent tyrosines with phenylalanine in the TK domain of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor suggested a maximal positive regulation by modification of both residues (40Longati P. Bardelli A. Ponzetto C. Naldini L. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the kinase activity of either single site mutant or of the double mutant was strongly reduced. However, the residual activity of the two mutants toward an exogenous substrate could still be enhanced by preincubation with unlabeled ATP, while the double mutant could not. Another conclusion that can be drawn from our comparative analysis of the in vivo phosphorylation state and in vitro kinase activity of wt and mutant proteins is that basal (ligand-independent) Tyk2 phosphorylation requires kinase activity and results from an autophosphorylation event which can occur on tyrosine residues other than Tyr-1054 and Tyr-1055, since mutant Y1054F/Y1055F is basally phosphorylated. While, as previously noted, the basal kinase activity of the Y1054F/Y1055F mutant is 50% that of the wt protein, no such difference can be observed in the in vivo phosphorylation levels of the two proteins. To explain this discrepancy it has to be assumed that either the wt protein can autophosphorylate, at least in vitro, on Tyr-1054 and/or Tyr-1055, thus becoming more active, or that the in vivo phosphotyrosine pattern, but not the overall content, differs for the two proteins. The finding that basal phosphorylation results from an autophosphorylation event is in apparent contrast with our observation that a number of kinase-inactive Tyk2 deletion mutants are found basally phosphorylated in the cell (see mutant ΔKL in (19Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3327-3334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). 2M. C. Gauzzi and S. Pellegrini, unpublished observation. In such mutants, however, the deletion might affect critical intra- or intermolecular interactions, thus unmasking phosphorylation targets for a neighboring kinase or disrupting the association with a regulatory tyrosine phosphatase. It is conceivable that the basal level of Tyk2 phosphorylation in the cell is the balanced result of spontaneous autoactivation and dephosphorylation by an interacting phosphatase and that deletion of critical domains or overexpression could displace this equilibrium (41David M. Chen H.E. Goelz S. Larner A.C. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7050-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 42Duhé R.J. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23084-23089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Tyk2-deficient cells have impaired IFN-α binding (reduced uptake of labeled IFN) which can be fully reconstituted by transfection of wt Tyk2 (18Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 19Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3327-3334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This and the finding that transfection of an inactive Tyk2 deleted of its TK domain (ΔTK) partially restores receptor-mediated IFN uptake highlighted a structural role of Tyk2 in receptor complex formation (19Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uzé G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3327-3334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Though an increase in binding affinity was observed, some dynamic aspects of productive binding (in particular the down phase) were not reconstituted. The uptake of labeled IFN-α is comparable in the K930R, Y1054F/Y1055F, and ΔTK transfectants, both in dynamics and affinity (data not shown), suggesting that it is not the physical presence of the TK domain, but rather its ligand-dependent activation, that contributes to the down phase of productive binding, which probably involves changes in stoichiometry, aggregation of binding sites, and a subsequent internalization of the complex (12Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 43Eid P. Bandu M.T. Uzé G. Mogensen K.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In spite of a similar IFN-α uptake ability, inducible gene expression is 10-fold higher in the Y1054F/Y1055F and K930R transfectants than in ΔTK-expressing cells (data not shown) suggesting that the TK domain contributes to the response. While the Y1054F/Y1055F mutant would contribute to JAK1 activation through its residual kinase activity, the function contributed by the kinase inactive mutant is more difficult to explain, as induced JAK1 phosphorylation is undetectable in these cells. We cannot totally exclude the possibility that the Lys to Arg substitution present in the K930R does not totally abolish kinase activity, as was reported for a Ser/Thr kinase bearing the same mutation in the ATP binding site (44Her J.-H. Lakhani S. Zu K. Dent J.V.P. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). On the other hand, kinase active JAK1 appears to be an essential prerequisite to Tyk2 activation and signaling, as was recently reported by I. M. Kerr and collaborators. They have expressed a kinase inactive form of JAK1 in a cell line deficient in endogenous JAK1 (11Müller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G. Witthuhn B.A. Schindler C. Pellegrini S. Wilks A.F. Ihle J.N. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Such transfectants do not respond to IFN-α (45Briscoe J. Rogers N.C. Witthuhn B.A. Watling D. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) nor can induced Tyk2 phosphorylation be detected. 3J. Briscoe, N. Rogers, and I. M. Kerr, personal communication. Altogether these results highlight the nonequivalence of the two kinases in the immediate activation steps of the cascade and suggest a temporal order of events whereby ligand binding to the multimeric receptor leads to JAK1-driven Tyk2 activation through trans-phosphorylation on Tyr-1054 and/or Tyr-1055. Activated Tyk2 might then potentiate signaling through autophosphorylation and positive feed-back onto JAK1. We think that the nonequivalence of Tyk2 and JAK1 in this system is not an intrinsic feature of the enzymes, but rather is dictated by the properties of the receptor chain to which each kinase is physically associated. The individual role of each receptor chain, the stoichiometry of the receptor/JAK complex, and possible changes upon ligand binding are not well known at the present time (12Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Tyk2 physically interacts with the membrane-proximal region of IFNAR1 and it is assumed that JAK1 physically interacts with the recently identified receptor chain IFNAR2-2 or βL. Assuming that these are unique or strongly preferred receptor/kinase interactions, the behavior of each enzyme (i.e. their spatial and temporal activation) will depend on the specific ligand binding properties of the receptor subunit to which it is bound.

Smith for advise in generating point mutants. We also thank O. Acuto, V. Di Bartolo, M. Lener, M. Richter, and R. Weil for fruitful discussions and critical review of the manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W2041093341,"The effects on the channel characteristics of four single amino acid substitutions in OmpF porin and of a deletion mutant in the constriction loop L3 have been studied. These mutations are all located in the narrow section of the channel of the protein that forms pores across the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. The single channel conductance of the deletion mutant (Δ109-114) is decreased by one third, whereas the point mutations do not exhibit significant deviations from that of the wild-type protein. The mutants exhibit drastic changes in ion selectivities. In the wild-type protein, the critical threshold potential (Vc), above which channels close reversibly, exhibits a strong pH dependence, with a titration point of ∼ pH 7.7, which is abolished in all mutants studied here. Diffusion of six monosaccharides is little affected in the point mutants, while four disaccharides are taken up at highly increased rates by the deletion mutant. The functional results, presented here, are correlated to the x-ray structures of the mutants (Lou, K.-L., Saint, N., Prilipov, A., Rummel, G., Benson, S.A., Rosenbusch, J.P., and Schirmer, T.

Here, we have investigated the possible role of guanine nucleotides. Mouse islets were incubated in a control medium (when K+-ATP channels are the major site of regulation) or in a high K+ medium (when glucose modulates the effectiveness of cytosolic Ca2+ on exocytosis). Glucose induced a concentration-dependent (0-20 mM) increase in GTP and a decrease in GDP in both types of medium, thus causing a progressive rise of the GTP:GDP ratio. ATP and ADP levels were 4-5-fold higher but varied in a similar way as those of guanine nucleotides. Insulin secretion was inversely correlated with ADP and GDP levels and positively correlated with the ATP:ADP and GTP:GDP ratios between 6 and 20 mM glucose in control medium and between 0 and 20 mM glucose in high K+ medium. The increases in the GTP:GDP and ATP:ADP ratios induced by a rise of glucose were faster than the decreases induced by a fall in glucose, but the changes of both ratios were again parallel. In conclusion, glucose causes large, concentration-dependent changes in guanine as well as in adenine nucleotides in islet cells. This raises the possibility that both participate in the regulation of nutrient-induced insulin secretion.

INTRODUCTIONThe regulation of pancreatic B cell function differs from that of other secretory cells in that the control of insulin secretion does not depend on the binding of the major physiological stimulator, glucose, to a receptor, but on its metabolism within B cells (reviewed in Refs. 1Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M.

This closure (hereafter referred to as the “primary mechanism” of control) leads to membrane depolarization with subsequent opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, Ca2+ influx, rise in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), and eventual triggering of insulin secretion (4Henquin J.C.

Purine nucleotides clearly stand out as potential candidates.The popular hypothesis that variations in the cytosolic concentrations or ratio of adenine nucleotides are involved in the primary mechanism of control by glucose rests primarily on the fact that K+ channels, which control the B cell membrane potential, are regulated by intracellular ATP and ADP (6Ashcroft F.M.

Although this hypothesis has long been disputed (reviewed in Ref. 14Erecińska M. Bry Michalik M. Meglasson M.D. Nelson D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 273-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), our demonstration of a correlation between insulin release and the ATP:ADP ratio in islets incubated in the presence of 6-20 mM glucose at least makes it plausible (15Detimary P. Jonas J.C. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1738-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We have also provided evidence supporting the role of adenine nucleotides in the second mechanism of control by glucose (12Gembal M. Detimary P. Gilon P. Gao Z.Y. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).It has been reported that GTP levels and/or the GTP:GDP ratio in islet cells are increased by glucose (16Zünkler B.J. Lenzen S.

Metabolism. 1989; 38: 1188-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) than those of adenine nucleotides. Moreover, they were generally observed at one single glucose concentration and, when evaluated further, no concentration dependence could be found (17Hoenig M. Matschinsky F.M.

This paucity of information on the influence of glucose on guanine nucleotides can largely be explained by the difficulty of measuring GTP and GDP in the small amounts of islet tissue that can be collected. It contrasts with the growing indirect support for a role of GTP in stimulus-secretion coupling in B cells (19Meredith M. Rabaglia M.E. Metz S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Dunne M.J. Petersen O.H. Pflügers Arch. 1986; 407: 564-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Vallar L. Biden T.J.

The time course of the changes was also investigated. The experiments were carried out with overnight cultured islets because the partial degranulation that these islets undergo decreases the pool of nucleotides present in insulin granules (15Detimary P. Jonas J.C. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1738-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and, hence, lowers the background above which variations in metabolically active pools are sought. The islets were incubated in a control medium under conditions where the primary mechanism of glucose control (at the K+-ATP channel level) plays the predominant role. They were also incubated in a medium containing diazoxide to keep K+-ATP channels open and high K+ to depolarize the membrane (27Detimary P. Gilon P. Nenquin M. Henquin J.-C. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), i.e. under conditions where the second mechanism of glucose control can be studied (12Gembal M. Detimary P. Gilon P. Gao Z.Y. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 27Detimary P. Gilon P. Nenquin M. Henquin J.-C. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThis study shows that variations in the ambient glucose concentration induce rapid, parallel changes in guanine and adenine nucleotides in normal mouse islets, and that most of these changes correlate well with insulin secretion from the same islets.Characteristics of the Changes in Adenine and Guanine NucleotidesSeveral studies have investigated the effects of glucose on adenine nucleotides in islet cells. Although glucose was generally found to increase ATP levels and the ATP:ADP ratio, the changes were usually of small amplitude and restricted to glucose concentrations below those which induce insulin release (14Erecińska M. Bry Michalik M. Meglasson M.D. Nelson D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 273-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 32Hellman B. Idahl L.-A. Danielsson A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 22887-22892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is only in the presence of high K+ and diazoxide that the ATP:ADP ratio was found to increase with glucose over a wide range (0-20 mM) of concentrations (12Gembal M. Detimary P. Gilon P. Gao Z.Y. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that partial degranulation of the islets decreases a fairly stable (granular) pool of adenine nucleotides. This unmasked large changes in the ATP:ADP ratio and a glucose dependence of these changes, which persisted within the range of stimulatory concentrations also under control conditions (15Detimary P. Jonas J.C. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1738-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The present study entirely confirms our previous findings.Here, we have also characterized the time course of these changes in adenine nucleotides. Raising the glucose concentration from 1 to 10 mM maximally increased the ATP:ADP ratio within 5 min (the shortest tested time), in agreement with previous studies (18Meglasson M.D. Nelson J. Nelson D. Erecinska M. Metabolism. 1989; 38: 1188-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34Malaisse W.J. Hutton J.C. Kawazu S. Herchuelz A. Valverde I. Sener A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 17525-17532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which an almost maximal effect was sometimes observed after 1 min (34Malaisse W.J. Hutton J.C. Kawazu S. Herchuelz A. Valverde I. Sener A. Diabetologia. 1979; 16: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 35Ohta M. Nelson D. Nelson J. Meglasson M.D. Erecińska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17525-17532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of a decrease in glucose concentration on islet nucleotides have not been reported previously. We show that the ATP:ADP ratio markedly decreased within 5 min and more slowly declined afterwards. These changes were due to a progressive and sustained decrease in ATP and a rise in ADP levels, which was maximal within 5-15 min. Interestingly, the changes in ATP were consistently larger than those in ADP, resulting in a stable ∼20% increase in the sum ATP + ADP upon elevation of glucose and in a progressive fall in this sum (by ∼30% after 60 min) upon diminution of glucose. In other, unpublished experiments, we observed only minor differences in AMP levels in islets incubated in low or high glucose. This suggests that variations in the ambient glucose concentration, at least between 0 and 10 mM, are associated with rapid changes in total adenine nucleotide concentrations. The mechanism involved in this synthesis of adenine nucleotides has not been identified, but the phenomenon must be borne in mind when interpreting the effects of the different glucose concentrations. On average, GTP levels corresponded to about 20% of ATP levels. This compares well with a proportion of 23% in two recent studies (19Meredith M. Rabaglia M.E. Metz S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Metz S.A. Rabaglia M.E. Pintar T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12517-12527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but is lower than the values of 33-38% of other reports (16Zünkler B.J. Lenzen S. Panten U. IRCS Med. Sci. 1986; 14: 354-355Google Scholar, 18Meglasson M.D. Nelson J. Nelson D. Erecinska M. Metabolism. 1989; 38: 1188-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The present study confirms that glucose increases GTP levels and the GTP:GDP ratio in islets (16Zünkler B.J. Lenzen S. Panten U. IRCS Med. Sci. 1986; 14: 354-355Google Scholar, 18Meglasson M.D. Nelson J. Nelson D. Erecinska M. Metabolism. 1989; 38: 1188-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Meredith M. Rabaglia M.E. Metz S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and, contrary to a previous study (18Meglasson M.D. Nelson J. Nelson D. Erecinska M. Metabolism. 1989; 38: 1188-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), shows that this effect is concentration-dependent and of rapid onset and reversibility. A central message emerging from our results is that guanine nucleotide levels in islet cells change in parallel with adenine nucleotide levels when the concentration of glucose varies, whether under control or depolarizing conditions. This rapid equilibration probably reflects the high NDPK activity present in the islets (37Kowluru A. Metz S.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12495-12503Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Functional Significance of the Changes in Adenine and Guanine NucleotidesCells, as a rule, maintain relatively stable levels of adenine and guanine nucleotides under physiological conditions. Pancreatic islet cells are thus peculiar in that their ATP:ADP and GTP:GDP ratios markedly and dose dependently change with the concentration of ambient glucose. This unusual characteristic is probably linked to the fact that glucose has to be metabolized by B cells to induce insulin release (1Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 2MacDonald M.J. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H.

It has long been known that ATP is necessary for insulin release (38Aleyassine H. Endocrinology. 1970; 87: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but whether its role is permissive or regulatory has proved much more difficult to establish. It is also not easy to define the respective roles of adenine and guanine nucleotides because they normally vary in parallel.Correlations between the rate of insulin release and the ATP:ADP ratio in islets were first observed when the energy state of islet cells was progressively decreased by mitochondrial poisons or by lowering O2 tension (27Detimary P. Gilon P. Nenquin M. Henquin J.-C. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 33Ashcroft S.J.H. Weerasinghe L.C.C. Randle P.J. Biochem.

Chem. 1990; 265: 17525-17532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is only recently that correlations between both parameters could be found when the concentration of glucose was varied under normal conditions where the primary mechanism of control, involving K+-ATP channels, is studied (15Detimary P. Jonas J.C. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1738-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The present work extends our previous findings in an important manner. It shows that glucose-induced insulin release also correlates with ADP and GDP levels, which raises the possibility that nucleotide diphosphates might be the critical variable.The effects of nucleotides on K+-ATP channels are complex. In the absence of Mg2+, ATP, ADP, GTP, and GDP inhibit the channels, albeit with markedly different potencies (ATP is by far the most potent) (6Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 8Dunne M.J. Petersen O.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 39Cook D.L.

Dickel C. Panten U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 111: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+, ATP remains inhibitory, but ADP is now stimulatory (6Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 8Dunne M.J. Petersen O.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Misler S.

(Lond.). 1987; 391: 611-629Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar), which supports the proposal that the ATP:ADP ratio has a regulatory role on the channel. On the other hand, it may seem confusing that both GTP and GDP activate K+-ATP channels in the presence of Mg2+ (20Dunne M.J. Petersen O.H. Pflügers Arch. 1986; 407: 564-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 40Findlay I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 391: 611-629Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 41Schwanstecher C. Dickel C. Panten U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 111: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, GTP is 12-fold less potent than GDP (41Schwanstecher C. Dickel C. Panten U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 111: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the activation could be explained by the contamination of GTP preparations with GDP that we (7% in this specific study) and others (42Bokvist K. Ämmälä C. Ashcroft F.M. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. Rorsman P. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1991; 243: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have measured. It has also been suggested that GTP is partially degraded into GDP by membrane patches (41Schwanstecher C. Dickel C. Panten U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 111: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Degradation of ATP into ADP by membrane patches has been demonstrated directly (43Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. J. Physiol. 1990; 423: 91-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 44Schwanstecher C. Dickel C. Ebers I. Lins S. Zünkler B.J. Panten U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 107: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Finally, and most importantly, GDP, like ADP, opens K+-ATP channels in the presence of ATP, whereas GTP is ineffective under these conditions (40Findlay I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 391: 611-629Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 42Bokvist K. Ämmälä C. Ashcroft F.M. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. Rorsman P. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1991; 243: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 45Dunne M.J. Bullett M.J. Li G. Wollheim C.B. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, the changes in the ATP:ADP ratio and those in the GTP:GDP ratio exert similar effects on K+-ATP channels. They might subserve the control of B-cell membrane potential not only by low, subthreshold glucose concentrations but also by concentrations that stimulate insulin release.We have recently reported that a correlation exists between the ATP:ADP ratio in islet cells and insulin release under depolarizing conditions (12Gembal M. Detimary P. Gilon P. Gao Z.Y. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), when the second mechanism of control by glucose is investigated. The present study confirms our findings and further shows that the correlation holds for the GTP:GDP ratio. The mechanisms of this K+-ATP channel-independent regulation of insulin release are still elusive, but potential sites of action of nucleotides can be envisaged. Of particular interest is the ATP-stimulatable Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 identified in islet cells (46Ramanadham S. Gross R.W. Han X. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 47Ramanadham S. Wolf M.J. Jett P.A. Gross R.W. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7442-7452Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is indeed activated by ATP in a concentration-dependent manner, and the effect of ATP is dose dependently inhibited by ADP. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of the enzyme decreases glucose-induced insulin release (46Ramanadham S. Gross R.W. Han X. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). GTP-binding proteins are another potential target. Thus, mastoparan, which is known to activate heterotrimeric (48Higashijima T. Burnier J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14176-14186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and low molecular weight (49Koch G. Mohr C. Just I. Aktories K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) GTP-binding proteins, increases insulin release mainly by acting at a late stage of the secretory process (23Jones P.M. Mann F.M. Persaud S.J. Wheeler-Jones C.P.D. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1993; 94: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24Komatsu M. McDermott A.M. Gillison S.L. Sharp G.W.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12869-12876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In experiments using permeabilized insulin-secreting cells, guanine nucleotides have been found to induce a Ca2+-independent release (21Vallar L. Biden T.J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5049-5056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to potentiate the secretory response to a rise in [Ca2+]i (25Jonas J.-C. Li G. Palmer M. Weller U. Wollheim C.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The latter effect is particularly relevant to the present observation that the second mechanism of glucose control, which involves a sensitization ot the action of Ca2+ (10Gembal M. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 12Gembal M. Detimary P. Gilon P. Gao Z.Y. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), correlated well with the GTP:GDP ratio.In an interesting attempt to dissociate the effects of ATP and GTP in stimulus-secretion coupling, Metz et al. (19Meredith M. Rabaglia M.E. Metz S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Metz S.A. Rabaglia M.E. Pintar T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12517-12527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have used mycophenolic acid, an inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase (50Franklin T.J. Cook J.M. Biochem. J. 1969; 113: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), to decrease the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides in islet cells. However, the interpretation of their experiments is not straightforward for two reasons. (a) The observed changes in GTP were attended by small changes in ATP (19Meredith M. Rabaglia M.E. Metz S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). (b) The effects of mycophenolic acid on GTP levels and on insulin release were not quantitatively correlated (22Metz S.A. Rabaglia M.E. Pintar T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12517-12527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, their results are suggestive of a specific role of GTP in glucose-induced insulin release. The present study indicates that the GTP:GDP ratio and, more particularly, GDP levels might be the important factor.In conclusion, variations in the ambient concentration of glucose produce rapid and concentration-dependent, parallel changes in adenine and guanine nucleotide levels in islet cells. These changes largely correlate with the changes in insulin release from the same islets, both under control conditions and when [Ca2+]i in B cells is raised by high extracellular K+. This indicates that both types of nucleotides, not only adenine nucleotides as thought previously, may participate in stimulus-secretion coupling and exert their regulatory action at more than one site. Of particular interest are the inverse correlations between insulin release and ADP or GDP levels. They suggest that dinucleotides have a potentially more important function than heretofore suspected. The identification of large effects of glucose on guanine nucleotides in pancreatic B cells also calls for an investigation of their role in processes other than insulin secretion. INTRODUCTIONThe regulation of pancreatic B cell function differs from that of other secretory cells in that the control of insulin secretion does not depend on the binding of the major physiological stimulator, glucose, to a receptor, but on its metabolism within B cells (reviewed in Refs. 1Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M.

This closure (hereafter referred to as the “primary mechanism” of control) leads to membrane depolarization with subsequent opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, Ca2+ influx, rise in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), and eventual triggering of insulin secretion (4Henquin J.C.

A “second mechanism” of control by glucose exists, which also depends on changes in metabolism (10Gembal M. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Clin.

It does not involve a further change in [Ca2+]i but an increase in the effectiveness of Ca2+ on its intracellular targets (12Gembal M. Detimary P. Gilon P. Gao Z.Y. Henquin J.C. J. Clin.

Despite numerous studies, the nature of the signals that link the acceleration of metabolism to the closure of K+-ATP channels and to the increase in Ca2+ action has only partially been elucidated. Purine nucleotides clearly stand out as potential candidates.The popular hypothesis that variations in the cytosolic concentrations or ratio of adenine nucleotides are involved in the primary mechanism of control by glucose rests primarily on the fact that K+ channels, which control the B cell membrane potential, are regulated by intracellular ATP and ADP (6Ashcroft F.M.

Moreover, they were generally observed at one single glucose concentration and, when evaluated further, no concentration dependence could be found (17Hoenig M. Matschinsky F.M.

This paucity of information on the influence of glucose on guanine nucleotides can largely be explained by the difficulty of measuring GTP and GDP in the small amounts of islet tissue that can be collected.

https://openalex.org/W1998464495,"Rat neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) is comprised of a flavin-containing reductase domain and a heme-containing oxygenase domain. Calmodulin binding to nNOS increases the rate of electron transfer from NADPH into its flavins, triggers electron transfer from flavins to the heme, activates NO synthesis, and increases reduction of artificial electron acceptors such as cytochrome c. To investigate what role the reductase domain plays in calmodulin's activation of these functions, we overexpressed a form of the nNOS reductase domain (amino acids 724-1429) in the yeast Pichia pastoris that for the first time exhibits a complete calmodulin response. The reductase domain was purified by 2′,5′-ADP affinity chromatography yielding 25 mg of pure protein per liter of culture. It contained 1 FAD and 0.8 FMN per molecule. Most of the protein as isolated contained an air-stable flavin semiquinone radical that was sensitive to FeCN6 oxidation. Anaerobic titration of the FeCN6-oxidized reductase domain with NADPH indicated the flavin semiquinone re-formed after addition of 1-electron equivalent and the flavins could accept up to 3 electrons from NADPH. Calmodulin binding to the recombinant reductase protein increased its rate of NADPH-dependent flavin reduction and its rate of electron transfer to cytochrome c, FeCN6, or dichlorophenolindophenol to fully match the rate increases achieved when calmodulin bound to native full-length nNOS. Calmodulin's activation of the reductase protein was associated with an increase in domain tryptophan and flavin fluorescence. We conclude that many of calmodulin's actions on native nNOS can be fully accounted for through its interaction with the nNOS reductase domain itself.

The enzyme is expressed constitutively in different neuronal cell types and in skeletal muscle but is inactive in its native form and requires Ca2+-promoted calmodulin binding to activate its NO synthesis (4Bredt D.S.

This property enables nNOS to participate in signal transduction cascades by generating NO only in response to increases in intracellular Ca2+ (5Garthwaite J. Boulton C.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar) but may also lead to neuropathological conditions due to excessive NO production during the prolonged Ca2+ influx that occurs following reperfusion of ischemic tissues (1Bredt D.S.

Sequence analysis indicates that the reductase domain of nNOS is structurally homologous to mammalian NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase, the flavoprotein of Escherichia coli sulfite reductase, and the reductase domain of bacterial cytochrome P450BM3 (1Bredt D.S.

Flavin-mediated electron transfer to the nNOS heme iron is thought to enable it to bind dioxygen and catalyze stepwise NO synthesis (2Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We recently reported that calmodulin binding to nNOS triggers interdomain electron transfer between the flavins and heme iron, providing a basis by which calmodulin may activate NO synthesis in this isoform (13Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Besides activating interdomain electron transfer to the heme iron, calmodulin binding to nNOS increases its rate of electron transfer to a variety of exogenous acceptors including cytochrome c, ferricyanide, dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), and dioxygen (15Heinzel B. John M. Klatt P. Bohme E. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 16Schmidt H.H.H.W. Smith R.M. Nakane M. Murad F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3243-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which calmodulin activates nNOS to reduce these external acceptors is controversial, in that there is evidence both for and against interdomain electron transfer or superoxide production being involved in the reactions (15Heinzel B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9425-9429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently showed that nNOS reductase activities toward cytochrome c or ferricyanide were increased to nearly the same extent when calmodulin bound to a heme-free form of nNOS, consistent with calmodulin increasing reduction of these acceptors by a mechanism that does not involve interdomain electron transfer to the nNOS heme iron (20Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis revealed that calmodulin binding also increases the rate by which NADPH reduces the nNOS flavins (20Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that calmodulin may increase electron transfer rates to certain external acceptors by activating the nNOS reductase domain itself.To investigate further the function of the nNOS reductase domain and its possible activation by calmodulin, we overexpressed a form of the nNOS reductase domain (amino acids 724-1429) that contains the calmodulin binding site, using the eukaryotic expression system Pichia pastoris. 2Although a similar form of the nNOS reductase domain has recently been expressed in E. coli (9McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), it was found to have properties that differ from native neuronal NOS. Here we characterize the physical, electronic, and catalytic properties of the recombinant reductase protein, and examine how calmodulin affects some of the properties. The results are compared with those obtained with native nNOS or with a proteolyzed form of the reductase protein that is missing a functional calmodulin binding site. Our findings establish that calmodulin binding fully activates the electron transfer properties of the nNOS reductase domain by a mechanism that is independent of the the enzyme's oxygenase domain. Further, calmodulin's activation of nNOS appears to represent a derepression of function when it is viewed relative to the three structurally related dual flavin reductases found in animals and bacteria.DISCUSSIONWe overexpressed the rat nNOS reductase domain in yeast to facilitate its characterization and to better understand how calmodulin controls electron transfer in nNOS. The recombinant reductase protein was identical to native nNOS in many respects, including its flavin content, fluorescence properties, stabilization of a flavin semiquinone radical, kinetics of flavin reduction by NADPH, and rates of electron transfer to cytochrome c and ferricyanide in the presence or absence of bound calmodulin. Thus, the yeast expression system appears to generate an intact reductase protein that fully maintains the properties of the native enzyme with the exception of catalyzing O2 reduction or NO synthesis, consistent with these reactions requiring the nNOS heme iron (20Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Abu-Soud H.M. Feldman P.L. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32318-32326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These properties distinguish our yeast-derived protein from nNOS reductase proteins that were expressed in E. coli (9McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) or generated by limited proteolysis of full-length nNOS (7Sheta E.A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15147-15153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which both display a higher basal activity toward cytochrome c reduction than native nNOS and either display no or a significantly reduced stimulation upon calmodulin binding.Earlier studies showed that calmodulin binding activates an interdomain electron transfer between the nNOS flavins and heme iron (13Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and also increases nNOS reduction of exogenous electron acceptors such as cytochrome c and ferricyanide (15Heinzel B. John M. Klatt P. Bohme E. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 16Schmidt H.H.H.W. Smith R.M. Nakane M. Murad F.

Our current work clearly establishes that calmodulin can fully activate nNOS reduction of cytochrome c and ferricyanide independent of electron transfer to the oxygenase domain. This conclusion is consistent with some of the earlier work that showed calmodulin-stimulated reductase activities of native nNOS are insensitive to compounds that block nNOS heme iron reduction (21Abu-Soud H.M. Feldman P.L. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32318-32326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wolff D.J. Datto G.A. Samatovicz R.A. Tempsick R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9425-9429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and could still occur in a native nNOS preparation that is missing its heme iron (20Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our current work also provides kinetic evidence against flavin-mediated oxygen reduction as being an intermediate step in reduction of cytochrome c. Specifically, the rate of O2 reduction by the calmodulin-bound or -free reductase protein (as indicated by NADPH oxidation) is much too low to contribute significantly to the observed rate of electron transfer to cytochrome c. Thus, we conclude that calmodulin promotes a direct electron transfer from nNOS to these acceptors by activating the nNOS reductase domain alone.Expression of the nNOS reductase domain enabled us to compare its properties with those of homologous NADPH-dependent reductases isolated from prokaryotic or eukaryotic sources. The nNOS reductase protein is similar to mammalian NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (10Iyanagi T. Mason H.S. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 26Otvos J.D.

Titration of the ferricyanide-oxidized nNOS reductase protein with NADPH showed that buildup of the flavin semiquinone became maximal when 0.5 mol of NADPH per mol of reductase was added. This implies that intramolecular electron transfer can occur between a 2-electron-reduced and fully oxidized reductase species resulting in redox disproportionation to generate a homogeneous population of semiquinone-containing molecules. Although maximal formation of the flavin semiquinone was possible under anaerobic conditions (i.e. 1 per domain), the 1-electron-reduced protein did not appear to be completely air-stable, because the protein lost about half of its semiquinone absorbance band after exposure to air. This behavior is consistent with our ferricyanide titration of the protein as isolated which indicates that only half to two-thirds of the reductase contains an odd electron. What promotes the partial instability of the radical is unclear and under current investigation. Upon further reduction with NADPH under anaerobic conditions, the nNOS reductase protein appeared to maintain a smaller but significant amount of its semiquinone character, as judged by partial maintenance of the 590-nm absorbance band that is attributed to this species. Like NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (23Vermilion J.L. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 266-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vermilion J.L. Coon M.J. J.

Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and the flavoprotein subunit of sulfite reductase (24Eschenbrenner M. Coves J. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20550-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the nNOS reductase protein resisted further reduction by NADPH after 3-electron equivalents had been added. This is consistent with the degree of structural conservation that exists between these three proteins and implies that the redox potentials of their 3- and 4-electron-reduced flavin couples may be similar.A comparison of the basal reductase activities obtained for the nNOS reductase protein and the published values for the related flavoproteins reveals that the nNOS reductase is comparatively down-regulated with respect to its rate of electron transfer to artificial acceptors. Indeed, only upon calmodulin binding do the rates become comparable with the other homologous reductases or with inducible NOS, which as purified contains tightly bound calmodulin (32Cho H.J. Xie Q.- Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). When viewed in this light, calmodulin binding appears to derepress the catalytic functions of the nNOS reductase domain, rather than activate them. Derepression is a common mechanism by which calmodulin interacts with other enzymes, including myosin light chain kinase, calmodulin kinase IV, and calcineurin (33Bagchi I.C. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 621-626PubMed Google Scholar, 34Pearson R.B. Wettenhall R.E.H. Means A.R. Hartshorne D.J. Kemp B.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 340-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In these enzymes, either the calmodulin binding domain or an adjacent site on the enzyme serves as a pseudosubstrate that blocks access of the natural substrate to the catalytic site until it is displaced upon binding calmodulin. Although it is conceivable that calmodulin binding may perform a similar function to enable the reductase domain of nNOS to interact with the oxygenase domain and engage in electron transfer (2Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), calmodulin clearly does not control nNOS access to its substrate L-arginine (7Sheta E.A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15147-15153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1992; 281: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 20Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because nNOS affinity for these molecules is nearly identical in the presence or absence of bound calmodulin. Our results with the delta 18 protein suggest that the unbound calmodulin recognition site may be slightly repressive with regard to cytochrome c, ferricyanide, and DCPIP reduction, because in its absence we consistently observed higher basal reductase activities in all cases. However, the fact that the delta 18 rates are not even midway between the basal and calmodulin-bound values means that calmodulin must increase nNOS reductase activities by a mechanism other than simply forming a complex with its recognition sequence on the enzyme. Indeed, a recent study suggests that there is a distinct interaction between nNOS and the latch region of calmodulin that is important for activating NO synthesis in the full-length enzyme (38Su Z. Blazing M.A. Fan D. George S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29117-29122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating if an interaction with the latch region is also involved in boosting the activities of the nNOS reductase protein upon calmodulin binding. 4R. Gachhui, S. George, and D. J. Stuehr, unpublished results. Involvement of a site on nNOS other than the calmodulin recognition sequence would be consistent with the current results.Structural changes in the reductase domain appear to be associated with increased catalysis upon calmodulin binding. Specifically, we observed an increase in protein tryptophan and flavin fluorescence that was quite similar to the changes obtained when calmodulin bound to full-length nNOS. This suggests that the fluorescence increases observed in the native enzyme are not due to a repositioning of the reductase domain relative to the oxygenase domain or of the flavins relative to the heme but instead arise due to structural changes within the reductase domain itself. Thus, calmodulin-induced fluorescence changes are clearly distinct from the fluorescence decrease that occurs when inducible NOS subunits interact to form a homodimer (39Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which exclusively involves the oxygenase domains of each subunit. Although the increase in flavin fluorescence associated with calmodulin binding was not completely reversed upon calmodulin dissociation with EDTA, the portion that was rapidly reversible may reflect a structural change that increases exposure of bound flavins to solvent. This would be consistent with our related work showing that calmodulin binding to the reductase protein greatly increases a paramagnetic interaction between its flavin semiquinone radical and dissolved oxygen. 5R. McArthur, G. Brudvig, and D. J. Stuehr, unpublished results. Thus, calmodulin binding to the nNOS reductase domain may cause a conformational change that opens up the domain structure as evidenced by a decreased internal quenching of protein tryptophan residues and flavins. These structural changes are in turn associated with an increased rate of electron influx into the flavins from NADPH, an increased rate of electron transfer from the flavins to acceptors such as cytochrome c, and activation of interdomain electron transfer to the heme iron in the case of full-length nNOS.Although our current work highlights specific effects of calmodulin on the reductase domain of nNOS, it is still unclear which of the effects are related to calmodulin activating electron transfer to the heme iron and thereby triggering NO synthesis by full-length nNOS. For example, calmodulin's increasing the rate of flavin reduction probably has little bearing on NO synthesis because even the basal rate of flavin reduction could support the rate of NO synthesis (20Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, this effect may be of primary importance regarding the increased rate of cytochrome c reduction. Conversely, calmodulin binding to its recognition sequence and inducing conformational changes does not appear to significantly affect the reductase domain's affinity for cytochrome c but may be very important in controlling its interaction with and electron transfer to the nNOS oxygenase domain.We conclude that the reductase domain plays a pivotal role in the calmodulin response by changing both its structural and catalytic properties upon calmodulin binding. This differentiates the nNOS reductase protein from the three structurally related proteins NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, the flavoprotein of sulfite reductase, and cytochrome P450BM3, whose activities are not influenced by Ca2+-binding proteins. However, at least two multicomponent redox systems (plant nitrate reductase and Desulfovibrio gigas sulfite reductase) are activated through mechanisms that may involve an interaction between a Ca2+-binding protein and a flavoprotein component of the redox system (40Liang Chen M.-Y. Le Gall J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 41Sane P.V. Kumar N. Baual M. Singh K.K. Kochhar V.K. Phytochemistry. 1987; 26: 1289-1291Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our findings with the nNOS reductase domain may therefore provide some insight regarding how Ca2+-binding proteins can control electron transfer in a variety of biological systems.

The enzyme is expressed constitutively in different neuronal cell types and in skeletal muscle but is inactive in its native form and requires Ca2+-promoted calmodulin binding to activate its NO synthesis (4Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar). This property enables nNOS to participate in signal transduction cascades by generating NO only in response to increases in intracellular Ca2+ (5Garthwaite J. Boulton C.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar) but may also lead to neuropathological conditions due to excessive NO production during the prolonged Ca2+ influx that occurs following reperfusion of ischemic tissues (1Bredt D.S.

Sequence analysis indicates that the reductase domain of nNOS is structurally homologous to mammalian NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase, the flavoprotein of Escherichia coli sulfite reductase, and the reductase domain of bacterial cytochrome P450BM3 (1Bredt D.S.

Flavin-mediated electron transfer to the nNOS heme iron is thought to enable it to bind dioxygen and catalyze stepwise NO synthesis (2Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A variety of evidence indicates that calmodulin binds between the reductase and oxygenase domains of nNOS at a site represented by amino acids 725-745 (4Bredt D.S.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We recently reported that calmodulin binding to nNOS triggers interdomain electron transfer between the flavins and heme iron, providing a basis by which calmodulin may activate NO synthesis in this isoform (13Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Besides activating interdomain electron transfer to the heme iron, calmodulin binding to nNOS increases its rate of electron transfer to a variety of exogenous acceptors including cytochrome c, ferricyanide, dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), and dioxygen (15Heinzel B. John M. Klatt P. Bohme E. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 16Schmidt H.H.H.W. Smith R.M. Nakane M. Murad F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3243-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which calmodulin activates nNOS to reduce these external acceptors is controversial, in that there is evidence both for and against interdomain electron transfer or superoxide production being involved in the reactions (15Heinzel B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9425-9429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently showed that nNOS reductase activities toward cytochrome c or ferricyanide were increased to nearly the same extent when calmodulin bound to a heme-free form of nNOS, consistent with calmodulin increasing reduction of these acceptors by a mechanism that does not involve interdomain electron transfer to the nNOS heme iron (20Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis revealed that calmodulin binding also increases the rate by which NADPH reduces the nNOS flavins (20Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that calmodulin may increase electron transfer rates to certain external acceptors by activating the nNOS reductase domain itself.To investigate further the function of the nNOS reductase domain and its possible activation by calmodulin, we overexpressed a form of the nNOS reductase domain (amino acids 724-1429) that contains the calmodulin binding site, using the eukaryotic expression system Pichia pastoris. 2Although a similar form of the nNOS reductase domain has recently been expressed in E. coli (9McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), it was found to have properties that differ from native neuronal NOS. Here we characterize the physical, electronic, and catalytic properties of the recombinant reductase protein, and examine how calmodulin affects some of the properties. The results are compared with those obtained with native nNOS or with a proteolyzed form of the reductase protein that is missing a functional calmodulin binding site. Our findings establish that calmodulin binding fully activates the electron transfer properties of the nNOS reductase domain by a mechanism that is independent of the the enzyme's oxygenase domain. Further, calmodulin's activation of nNOS appears to represent a derepression of function when it is viewed relative to the three structurally related dual flavin reductases found in animals and bacteria."

Blood. 1996; 87: 2020-2028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), specifically bound PS and PI liposomes with high affinity. PS and PI liposomes competed effectively with labeled PS liposomes and modified lipoproteins for binding to CD36. We have recently shown that CD36 is expressed on the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and plays a role in the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (ROS) (2Ryeom S.W. Sparrow J.R. Silverstein R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 387-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phagocytosis of ROS by RPE is critical to the normal visual process. When this process is impaired in experimental animals, the retina degenerates, leading eventually to blindness (3Bok D. Hall M.O. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 49: 664-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). For many years, it was known that ROS ingestion was mediated by a specific ligand-receptor interaction (16McLaughlin B.J. Cooper N.G.F. Shepherd V.L. Prog. Retinal & Eye Res. 1994; 1: 147-164Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and recently we reported CD36 as a candidate receptor on the RPE (2Ryeom S.W. Sparrow J.R. Silverstein R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 387-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the ligand on ROS membranes is yet to be identified. Photoreceptor outer segments are composed of stacks of double-layered circular disks formed continuously at the base of the outer segment of rod and cone cells (17Bibb C. Young R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 327-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). During the normal process of outer segment disk renewal, packets of disks are intermittently shed from the apical ends of the rod outer segments and are then immediately phagocytosed by the RPE (18Bok D. Ryan S.J. Retina. The C. V. Mosby Co., St. Louis, MO1989: 69-81Google Scholar). Outer segments consist predominantly of protein combined with phospholipid. Approximately 75% of the membrane protein is rhodopsin, while the phospholipid content of ROS membranes is close to 25%. The phospholipid composition is made up of about 80% PC and PE, while PS accounts for 13% and PI ∼7% (19Anderson R.E. Maude M.B. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 3624-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The report that CD36 binds PS and PI in vitro and the observation that PS and PI are present on ROS membranes prompted us to investigate the possibility that PS and PI were the ligands involved in the recognition of ROS by CD36 on the RPE surface. Using artificial phospholipid vesicles as models of ROS membrane, we found that phospholipid vesicles containing negatively charged phospholipids such as PS and PI competed for ROS phagocytosis by RPE. Furthermore, PS and PI liposomes bound specifically to and were internalized by RPE, and the binding and uptake were blocked by anti-CD36 IgG. Taken together, these data suggest that anionic phospholipids are the ligands on ROS membranes that are specifically recognized by CD36 on the RPE cell surface. This is the first demonstration that anionic phospholipids may be physiological ligands for CD36 and participate in normal scavenger receptor recognition.

Mouse mAb to rhodopsin, Rho-4D2, was a generous gift from Dr. Robert Molday (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Rabbit anti-rat CD36 IgG was prepared as described by Ryeom et al. (2Ryeom S.W. Sparrow J.R. Silverstein R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 387-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unilamellar liposomes were made by extrusion through polycarbonate membranes (20Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar, 21Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). Phospholipid liposomes were prepared containing the indicated phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine, and free cholesterol in a molar ratio of 1:1:1. Liposomes made with all four phospholipids and cholesterol had a molar ratio of 2:1 with PC-PE-PS-PI (50:25:10:1). The lipids were dissolved in benzene and lyophilized overnight. For radiolabeled liposomes, 50 µCi of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-L-3-phosphatidyl[N-methyl-3H]choline (69 Ci/mmol) was added to each liposome mixture before drying. The dried lipids were resuspended in 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5. Once the samples were fully hydrated, they were extruded first through a 1.0-µm pore size polycarbonate membrane, and then one-half of the sample was extruded through a second, 0.1-µm pore size polycarbonate membrane using an extruder device (Lipex Biomembranes, Inc., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). The final phospholipid concentrations of each liposome were determined by the method of Dittmer and Wells (22Dittmer J.C. Wells M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 482-530Crossref Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Liposomes were then stored under argon at 4°C and were used within 2 weeks of preparation. All experiments were performed with both 1.0-µm and 0.1-µm liposomes. Primary cultures of Long Evans (LE) and Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat RPE were established as described previously (2Ryeom S.W. Sparrow J.R. Silverstein R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 387-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from 2-4-week-old rats. The cultures were maintained in a humidified environment at 37°C and 10% CO2, with feeding twice weekly, and were not passaged. The cells were grown for up to 3 weeks. ROS were isolated as described previously (2Ryeom S.W. Sparrow J.R. Silverstein R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 387-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from bovine eyes obtained from the slaughterhouse within 4 h of death. Isolated, intact ROS were radioiodinated according to the method of Clark and Hall (23Clark V.M. Hall M.O. Exp. Eye Res. 1982; 34: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). LE or RCS rat RPE cells were cultured to confluence in 96-well plates or chamber slides. Preincubation of cells with CD36 mAb or different concentrations of phospholipid liposomes was carried out in growth medium for 30 min at 37°C. Subsequently, equal concentrations of 125I-labeled ROS were added to the cells in the presence of the different treatments, and the 96-well plates were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 4 min and incubated for 2 h in a humidified environment at 37°C and 10% CO2. Following this incubation, the cells were washed thoroughly with culture medium and treated with 100 µl of solubilization buffer (1% SDS, 0.5 M NaOH, 10 mM EDTA) for 30 min at 37°C. Cell-associated radioactivity was measured in a gamma counter, and protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay. The data (dpm/µg protein) were analyzed by analysis of variance to establish significant differences among treatment and control groups. 3H-Liposomes were diluted to the indicated concentrations in RPE growth medium with 2.5% sucrose, added to LE or RCS rat RPE cells in the absence or presence of different treatments, and incubated for 2 h in a humidified environment at 37°C and 10% CO2. Following this incubation, the cells were washed thoroughly with culture medium and treated with 200 µl of solubilization buffer (described above) for 30 min at 37°C. Cell-associated radioactivity was measured in a beta counter, while protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay. In blocking or competition experiments, cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37°C with rabbit anti-rat CD36 IgG, control preimmune IgG, unlabeled liposomes, or ROS which were diluted 3-fold in Hepes-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution, pelleted at 5000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C, and resuspended in growth medium with 2.5% sucrose at a concentration of 5 × 107-1.5 × 108 ROS/ml. The data (cpm/mg protein) were analyzed by analysis of variance to establish significant differences among treatment and control groups. To determine whether phospholipids could be bound and internalized by normal rat RPE, the binding and/or ingestion of different radiolabeled liposomes was examined at 37°C. RPE isolated from normal LE rats showed a significantly high level (p < 0.01) of PS liposome binding and/or uptake at a concentration of 150 µg of phospholipid/ml (Fig. 1A) compared with liposomes containing other phospholipids. This was dose dependent, because PS liposomes at a concentration of 25 µg/ml demonstrate a significant (p < 0.1) yet much lower level of uptake. Liposome binding and/or uptake by LE RPE was dependent on the phospholipid composition of the liposome. While PC and PI liposomes were taken up by RPE in a concentration-dependent manner, binding and/or uptake was less than that of PS but significant (p < 0.1) in comparison to PE. In contrast, there was no significant uptake (p > 0.1) of PE liposomes at either concentration. These results indicate that PS phospholipids are the predominant phospholipid bound and/or internalized by LE RPE with a small amount of binding and/or uptake seen with PC and PI phospholipids. Liposomes composed of all four phospholipids in a molar ratio similar to that of isolated bovine ROS also demonstrated significant levels of binding and/or uptake (p < 0.1) by LE RPE. The specificity of phospholipid binding and/or uptake were further studied by determining whether unlabeled liposomes or anti-CD36 IgG could compete for or block [3H]PS, [3H]PC, and [3H]PI binding and/or uptake by RPE. Table I demonstrates that the unlabeled anionic phospholipids, PS and PI, at 150 µg/ml were effective competitors of both [3H]PS and [3H]PI binding and/or uptake when PS and PI were preincubated with cells. Meanwhile, PC had no effect on [3H]PS binding and/or uptake; similarly, PS did not have a pronounced effect on [3H]PC binding and/or uptake. However, [3H]PC binding and/or uptake were blocked by unlabeled PC. When LE RPE were preincubated with anti-CD36 IgG, [3H]PS and [3H]PI binding and/or uptake were significantly inhibited (p < 0.01) compared with [3H]PC. Preimmune IgG had no effect on the level of binding or uptake of any of the liposomes, demonstrating specificity. These data indicate a high level of specific binding and/or uptake of PS liposomes by LE RPE and a lower level, but specific, of binding and/or uptake of PI and PC liposomes. The reciprocal ability of PS and PI to inhibit binding and/or uptake implies that they are probably recognized by the same receptor while the specific inhibition seen with anti-CD36 IgG suggests that this receptor is CD36. These results are consistent with the findings of Rigotti et al. (1Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), who have reported that CD36 is a receptor for anionic phospholipids such as PS and PI, by cells transfected with CD36 cDNA.TABLE ISpecificity of [3H]PS, [3H]PI, and [3H]PC binding and/or uptake by LE RPECompeting liposomes or blocking agents[3H]PS uptake[3H]PI uptake[3H]PC uptake% of controlNone100100100PS9.532.177.3PI24.315.9PC91.39.9Anti-CD36 IgG21.528.483.7Preimmune IgG102.7105.998.3 Open table in a new tab The RCS rat is an animal model of retinal degeneration with a defect localized to RPE cells that are unable to phagocytose shed photoreceptor outer segments (3Bok D.

Fig. 1B demonstrates binding and/or uptake of different phospholipid liposomes by RCS rat RPE at 37°C. There was no significant phagocytosis of either [3H]PS (p > 0.1) or [3H]PI (p > 0.1) by RCS RPE (Fig. 1B) compared with LE RPE (Fig. 1A); however, [3H]PC at 150 µg/ml was bound and/or taken up by RCS rat RPE at a significant level (p < 0.05) compared with [3H]PS or [3H]PI and was similar to the level of binding and/or uptake by LE rat RPE (Fig. 1A). We also examined whether isolated ROS could compete for [3H]PS and [3H]PI phagocytosis by RPE. When normal RPE were preincubated with isolated unlabeled ROS, [3H]PS binding and/or internalization were significantly inhibited (p < 0.01) compared with control, untreated [3H]PS binding (Fig. 2). [3H]PI binding and/or uptake was also significantly blocked (p < 0.05) when LE RPE were preincubated with ROS. Similarly, binding and/or uptake of 3H-liposomes containing PC, PE, PS, and PI was significantly inhibited (p < 0.01) in the presence of excess, cold bovine ROS, while ROS were not able to compete for either [3H]PC or [3H]PE binding or uptake. Previously, using a quantitative in vitro assay with 125I-labeled ROS (2Ryeom S.W. Sparrow J.R. Silverstein R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 387-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we established that CD36 mediates the phagocytosis of ROS by RPE. In Fig. 3, the same assay was performed with LE RPE by measuring 125I-labeled ROS binding and/or uptake in the presence of unlabeled liposomes of various phospholipid compositions. In the presence of PS liposomes, 125I-labeled ROS binding and/or uptake was significantly inhibited (p < 0.01) to an extent similar to that seen with anti-CD36 IgG (2Ryeom S.W. Sparrow J.R. Silverstein R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 387-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To a lesser extent PI liposomes also significantly inhibited (p < 0.05) levels of ROS binding and/or uptake as compared to PC or PE liposomes. Meanwhile, neither PC nor PE liposomes had a significant effect (p > 0.1) on the levels of ROS binding and/or uptake. In this work, we have studied the role of phospholipids in the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments by RPE. Scavenger receptors have been reported to recognize the negatively charged surface of a ligand and have been extensively described with respect to their phagocytosis of modified low density lipoprotein, which often has increased net anionic charges (25Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). A CD36 cDNA-transfected cell model has recently been used to demonstrate that anionic phospholipid liposomes also bind CD36 (1Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). We have now shown that normal RPE specifically bound and/or internalized liposome vesicles containing PS phospholipids and to a lesser extent, PI and PC. The binding and/or uptake of PS and PI was found to be competed by excess, unlabeled liposomes of either type and inhibited by a specific anti-CD36 antibody. PC uptake, although blocked with cold PC liposomes, was not affected by PS or by the presence of anti-CD36 IgG. These results indicate that PS and PI are recognized by the same receptor on RPE which may be CD36 (1Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 2Ryeom S.W. Sparrow J.R. Silverstein R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 387-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data also suggest that PC is taken up by a different mechanism. Further evidence supporting a role for CD36 in the binding and/or uptake of PS and PI was obtained by examining liposome binding to dystrophic RCS rat RPE. We have reported that RCS RPE lack CD36 expression and that the defect in RPE-mediated ROS uptake may be associated with its absence (26Sparrow J.R. Ryeom S.W. Abumrad N. Ibrihimi A. Silverstein R.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). RCS RPE did not bind or internalize either PS or PI liposomes, suggesting that the absence of CD36 prevents binding and/or internalization of these negatively charged phospholipids. On the other hand, since PC liposomes were bound and/or ingested by RCS rat RPE at levels similar to those seen with LE rat RPE, a receptor mediating PC liposome phagocytosis may be present on dystrophic as well as normal RPE. Our results with RPE are the first description of CD36-specific binding of PS and PI liposomes by cells normally expressing CD36. More importantly, they suggest a physiological role for the CD36-phospholipid interaction in the selective phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments by RPE (2Ryeom S.W. Sparrow J.R. Silverstein R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 387-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a function critical to the normal visual process (3Bok D. Hall M.O. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 49: 664-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 4Edwards R.B. Szamier R.B. Science. 1977; 197: 1001-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This conclusion is based on our demonstration that PS and PI, but not PC or PE, liposomes blocked ROS binding and uptake by RPE and conversely isolated ROS blocked PS and PI binding and/or uptake. Furthermore, we showed that liposomes consisting of phospholipids in molar ratios similar to that for purified, bovine ROS were bound and/or internalized by RPE and that this process was inhibited by excess purified, bovine ROS as well as by anti-CD36 IgG. 2S. W. Ryeom, R. L. Silverstein, A, Scotto, and J. R. Sparrow, unpublished data. This report provides evidence that ROS phagocytosis is mediated by the interaction of the scavenger receptor CD36 on the RPE with anionic phospholipids present on the surface of ROS membranes. Since previous work demonstrated a consistent 60% decrease in ROS uptake in the presence of antibodies to CD36, we have suggested that CD36 acts together with a co-receptor to mediate ROS phagocytosis (2Ryeom S.W. Sparrow J.R. Silverstein R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 387-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The similar level of inhibition of PS and PI uptake seen by anti-CD36 IgG further confirms this two receptor model. It is possible that the co-receptor may be an unidentified receptor involved in the binding and/or uptake of PC liposomes."

In this report we demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinases are resistant to inhibition by ionizing radiation exposure in A-T cells, and this appears to be due to insufficient induction of WAF1. Exposure of control lymphoblastoid cells to radiation during S phase and in G2 phase causes a rapid inhibition of cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin B-Cdc2 activities, respectively. Irradiation led to a 5-20-fold increase in Cdk-associated WAF1 in these cells, which accounts at least in part for the decrease in cyclin-dependent kinase activity. In contrast, radiation did not inhibit any of the cyclin-dependent kinase activities in S phase or G2 phase in A-T cells at short times after irradiation nor was there any significant change in the level of Cdk-associated WAF1 compared to unirradiated cells. These results are similar to those reported previously for the G1 checkpoint and provide additional evidence for the involvement of ATM at multiple points in cell cycle regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2029473646,"The enzyme ribonucleotide reductase consists of two nonidentical proteins, R1 and R2, which are each inactive alone. R1 contains the active site and R2 contains a stable tyrosyl radical essential for catalysis. The reduction of ribonucleotides is radical-based, and a long range electron transfer chain between the active site in R1 and the radical in R2 has been suggested. To find evidence for such an electron transfer chain in Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase, we converted two conserved tyrosines in R1 into phenylalanines by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant proteins were shown to be enzymatically inactive. In addition, the mechanism-based inhibitor 2′-azido-2′-deoxy-CDP was incapable of scavenging the R2 radical, and no azido-CDP-derived radical intermediate was formed. We also show that the loss of enzymatic activity was not due to impaired R1-R2 complex formation or substrate binding. Based on these results, we predict that the two tyrosines, Tyr-730 and Tyr-731, are part of a hydrogen-bonded network that constitutes an electron transfer pathway in ribonucleotide reductase.

By catalyzing the reduction of ribonucleotides to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides, the enzyme furnishes cells with precursors for DNA synthesis. To maintain a stable and balanced supply of nucleotides during cell proliferation, the enzyme is cell cycle regulated (1Sun L. Fuchs J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and also under strict allosteric regulation (for recent review see Ref. 2Sjöberg B.-M. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acid & Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 192Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase holoenzyme complex consists of two nonidentical dimeric proteins, R1 and R2, which are each inactive alone. The larger protein R1 contains substrate and allosteric effector binding sites. The substrate binding site of R1 includes a cysteine triad that is involved in catalysis (3Åberg A. Hahne S.

The smaller protein R2 contains an essential tyrosyl radical that is generated and stabilized by an oxo-bridged diiron center (6Ehrenberg A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3485-3488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sjöberg B.-M. Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J.

Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The oxidized tyrosyl radical of R2 probably participates in the reaction mechanism as a transient electron sink. The reaction catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase is the reduction of the 2′-hydroxyl group of a ribonucleoside diphosphate. The mechanism involves the initial generation of a transient protein radical in R1 close to the bound substrate. The protein radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the 3′ position of the substrate thereby generating an oxidized substrate radical that enables leaving the protonated 2′-hydroxyl group. The resulting substrate radical cation intermediate is reduced by a redox-active cysteine pair, which in turn is oxidized to a disulfide (10Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The 3′-hydrogen atom is reintroduced by the same amino acid that initially abstracted it and that again forms the transient protein radical (11Stubbe J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 349-419PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the R2 protein shows that the R2 radical is buried inside the protein structure about 10 Å from the closest surface (9Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Two possibilities have been suggested by which the tyrosyl radical in R2 and the active site in R1 could possibly interact: a direct interaction through considerable conformational changes in the proteins or an indirect interaction via a long range electron transfer. Since the spectroscopic characteristics of the tyrosyl radical are unchanged in the holoenzyme complex as compared with the R2 protein alone, no major conformational changes are likely to occur at the site of the R2 radical during R1-R2 complex formation (12Sahlin M. Petersson L. Gräslund A. Ehrenberg A. Sjöberg B.-M. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5541-5548Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This argues in favor of the presence of a long range electron transfer chain within the ribonucleotide reductase enzyme. The three-dimensional structures for both protein R1 and protein R2 have been solved to a high resolution (5Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 9Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), but the structure of the holoenzyme complex is not yet known. A plausible model of the R1-R2 complex suggests that the distance between the radical in R2 and the active site in R1 is about 35 Å. In this part of the modeled complex, there is an array of conserved residues that has been proposed to constitute the electron transfer chain. The residues are Tyr-122, Asp-84, His-118, Asp-237, Trp-48, and Tyr-356 in the R2 protein and Tyr-730, Tyr-731, and Cys-439 in the R1 protein (cf. Fig. 1). These residues form a hydrogen-bonded network running through the holoenzyme complex. For five of the R2 residues and the cysteine in R1, site-directed mutagenesis showed that substitutions of any of the residues resulted in a catalytically inactive mutant protein (3Åberg A. Hahne S.

Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of Trp-103 and Asp-266 in the mouse enzyme (corresponding to Trp-48 and Asp-237 in the E. coli enzyme) suggests that they participate in a corresponding electron transfer chain in mouse ribonucleotide reductase (15Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). When considered together, this implies that the electron is transferred via a specific route comprised of at least nine amino acids. The two tyrosines in the R1 protein, Tyr-730 and Tyr-731, are located close to the active site. Tyr-730 is hydrogen-bonded to Tyr-731 and Cys-439, the latter of which has been proposed to be the residue that abstracts the 3′-hydrogen atom during catalysis. Tyr-731 is located close to the R1-R2 interaction area in the model-built holoenzyme complex. In this paper, we altered each of the two conserved R1 tyrosines to phenylalanines by site-directed mutagenesis and characterized the mutant proteins. We showed that both mutant proteins were inactive in the presence of normal substrate as well as the substrate analogue 2′-azido-2′-deoxy-CDP (CzDP), 1The abbreviations used are: CzDP2′-azido-2′-deoxy-CDP. even though both mutant proteins could form an R1-R2 complex and bind substrate. These data strongly suggest that the two tyrosine residues, Tyr-730 and Tyr-731, participate in an electron transfer chain between the R2 radical and the R1 active site. 2′-azido-2′-deoxy-CDP. The oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis (underlining denotes mismatched nucleotide), Y730F (d(5′-AACACTGTTTATCAGAACACCCG-3′)) and Y731F (d(5′-AACACTGTATTTCAGAACACCCG-3′)), were synthesized and purified by Scandinavian Gene Synthesis AB. Single-stranded sequencing primers, me6 d(5′-GTCAGGAAAAGTGGCCG-3′)), me11 (d(5′-AGATCTGGATACCATCG-3′)), and me19 (d(5′-TAACCTGGATGAACTTGG-3′)) were synthesized and purified by Scandinavian Gene Synthesis AB, and Universe-40 (d(5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′)) was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The 2′-azido-2′-deoxy-CDP was obtained by cleavage of its CTP derivative by incubation with myosin and then purified on a DEAE-cellulose column. The 2′-azido-2′-deoxy-CTP was purchased from Amersham Corp. E. coli CJ236 (dut-1, ung-1, thi-1, relA/pCJ105 Cmr) and E. coli MV1190 (Δ(lac-proAB), thi, supE, Δ(srl-recA)306::Tn 10/F′ traD36, proAB, lacIqZΔM15), obtained from Bio-Rad, were used for mutagenesis and cloning. E. coli MC1009/pGP1-2 (Δ(lacIPOZYA)X74, galE, galK, strA, Δ(ara-leu)7697, araD139, recA, srl::Tn10), obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., was used for expression. pTZ18R, obtained from Pharmacia, contains a T7 promoter upstream of a cloning cassette (16Mead D.A. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The plasmid pTB1 is a derivative of pTZ18R, which contains the E. coli nrdA gene coding for the R1 protein (3Åberg A. Hahne S. Karlsson M. Larsson Å. Ormö M. Åhgren A. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12249-12252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pGP1-2, obtained from S. Tabor, codes for T7 polymerase under the control of the λPL promoter and a heat-sensitive cI857 repressor under the control of the Lac promoter (17Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of pTB1 was performed using the Muta-Gene Phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit from Bio-Rad based on a method described by Kunkel (18Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4889) Google Scholar). Initial verifications of the mutations were done by the Sanger chain termination DNA sequencing method using the Sequenase version 2.0 kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. A 750-base pair long SphI/Sfu1 fragment of the mutants was sequenced using the Tac Dye Deoxy Terminator cycle sequencing kit and cloned into a wild-type pTB1 plasmid. The sequencing reactions were performed with polymerase chain reaction and analyzed with an automated laser fluorescent DNA sequencer from Applied Biosystems. MC1009/pGP1-2, containing either pTB1 Y730F or Y731F was grown overnight at 30°C in 50 ml of Luria broth supplemented with kanamycin (50 µg/ml) and carbenicillin (50 µg/ml). The next day, 4 liters of the same medium were inoculated with 40 ml of culture grown overnight and shaken vigorously (300 rpm) at 30°C. At A640 = 0.5, the temperature was raised to 42°C to induce the λPL promoter by heat inactivation of the CI857 repressor. Growth was continued until late log phase (A = 1.7). After incubation (about 4 h), the culture was quickly chilled and centrifuged at 4000 × g. The pellets were frozen and stored at −80°C for further purification. Frozen cells were disintegrated in a BIOX X-press and then resuspended in extraction buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 µM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Purification was essentially as described by Sjöberg et al. (19Sjöberg B.-M. Hahne S. Karlsson M. Jörnvall H. Göransson M. Uhlin B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5658-5662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fractions from the DEAE column that contain R1 were pooled and ultradialyzed in ultradialysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, and 10 mM dithiothreitol. For further purification, the dialyzed sample was applied on a fast protein liquid chromatography Mono Q 10/10 ion-exchange column and eluted with a gradient of NaCl in ultradialysis buffer. The purified protein was then stored at −80°C. The purity of the protein was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the Coomassie Blue-stained tracks were scanned in a Molecular Dynamics, Inc. computing laser densitometer. Protein concentrations were determined using the absorbance at 280 nm minus that at 310 nm. Molar extinction coefficients of 180,000 M−1 cm−1 for R1 and 120,000 M−1 cm−1 for R2 were used. The UV-visible absorbance spectra were collected on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2 spectrophotometer. For crystallization, proteins were purified as described previously (20Uhlin U. Uhlin T. Eklund H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The strength of the R1-R2 interactions was determined in a series of inhibition experiments where the mutant R1 proteins were used as inhibitors of wild-type ribonucleotide reductase activity. Enzyme activity was measured according to the [3H]CDP assay (see below) with a constant R2 concentration of 0.03 µM, and the R1 concentrations were varied between 0.04 and 0.7 µM. The concentrations of inhibitors R1 Y730F and Y731F were 0, 0.07, 0.26, and 1.05 µM for R1 Y730F and 0, 0.07, 0.26, and 0.53 µM for R1 Y731F. The inhibition constants (Ki) for the mutant proteins were determined graphically by plotting Kapp versus inhibitor concentration. Substrate binding of GDP to the mutant proteins was performed according to the method of direct partition through ultrafiltration (21Ormö M. Sjöberg B.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The experiments were carried out at 25°C, using 7.4 µM R1, 6-50 µM tritium-labeled GDP as substrate, and 40 µM dTTP as effector. Assays were performed and analyzed as described for the [3H]CDP assay (22Thelander L. Sjöberg B.-M. Eriksson S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in a final volume of 50 µl with 1.5 mM ATP as effector and 0.5 mM [3H]CDP (63,000 cpm/nmol) as substrate and in the presence of the thioredoxin-reducing system. One enzyme unit is defined as the amount of R1 reducing 1 nmol of product/min at room temperature in the presence of an excess of R2. Experiments were done essentially as described previously (13Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4801-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 23Sjöberg B.-M. Gräslund A. Eckstein F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8060-8067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that 40 µM R1, 20 µM R2, 0.2 mM dTTP, 4.2 mM CzDP, and 3.5 mM CDP were used. The samples were incubated at 25°C for different times and subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen. The Y730F and Y731F proteins were crystallized in the space group R32 with hexagonal cell axes a = b = 226 Å and c = 341 Å as in the wild type (20Uhlin U. Uhlin T. Eklund H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The crystals were obtained by hanging drops of 10 µl (5 µl of protein mixture + 5 µl of reservoir solution). The protein mixture contained 15 mg/ml R1 protein and a 20-fold excess of a 20-residue peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the R2 subunit. The reservoir contained 17% lithium sulfate and 10 mM magnesium chloride in 25 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Diffraction data for both mutants were collected to 2.8-Å resolution at the synchrotron in Hamburg, Germany (station X31, EMBL outstation). Data were indexed and integrated with Denzo, scaled and reduced with Scalepack (24Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Baily S. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend Data Collection and Processing. Daresbury, United Kingdom1993: 56Google Scholar, 25Minor W. XDISPLAYF Program. Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN1993Google Scholar), and truncated with programs from the CCP4 suite (26Collaborative Computational Project, N. 4. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19727) Google Scholar). The resulting data for the Y730F mutant are comprised of 78,000 unique reflections with an averaged redundancy of 3.2, an Rmerge of 8.7%, and a completeness of 94.8%. The corresponding values for Y731F were 82,000, 2.4, 9.7, and 98.4%, respectively. The coordinates of wild-type E. coli R1 ribonucleotide reductase (5Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) were used as a starting model for refinement with TNT (27Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1987; 43: 489-501Crossref Scopus (873) Google Scholar). The refined models were evaluated and corrected using O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13005) Google Scholar) and then further refined with TNT. Y730F and Y731F proteins have R-factors of 18 and 19%, respectively, with good geometry and root mean square differences in bond lengths of 0.023 Å and 0.020 Å and root mean square differences in angles of 2.3° and 2.5°. EPR spectra measured at 77 K were recorded on an ER 200D Bruker spectrometer using a cold finger Dewar flask for liquid nitrogen. Quantitation of the EPR signals was performed by a comparison with a standard R2 sample of 1.5 mM tyrosyl radical, previously quantitated from the comparison of double integrals of the protein sample with a Cu-EDTA standard (1-10 mM). Spectra at 9 K were recorded on an ESP 300 Bruker spectrometer equipped with an Oxford instrument cryostat. Subtractions at 9 K and double integrals were performed using the ESP 300 software. The constructs R1 Y730F and Y731F contained only the desired TAT → TTT mutations as verified by dideoxy sequencing. Expression and purification of mutant proteins yielded about 50 mg of protein of 60% purity from 20 g of heat-induced cells. The mutant proteins behaved like R1 wild-type protein during expression and purification except for a tendency to precipitate early in the purification procedure that could be overcome by inclusion of 20% glycerol in all purification steps. The three-dimensional structures of the two mutant R1 proteins were solved by using the wild-type structure as the initial model (5Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The refined structures confirm that the mutants contain phenylalanines at positions 730 or 731, respectively. The phenylalanines occupy the same positions as the wild-type tyrosines, maintaining the π-π interaction between them (Fig. 1). The structural differences are small in the vicinities of the phenylalanines and negligible within experimental error, indicating that the phenotypic differences compared with the wild-type R1 are due only to the loss of either of the phenolic hydroxyl groups. The Y731F mutant shows no other major differences compared with the wild-type R1 protein. There is one major difference compared with the wild-type R1 in the Y730F crystal structure. Whereas wild-type R1 crystallized in the absence of reductants was obtained in the oxidized form, the redox-active cysteine pair (Cys-225 and Cys-462) was reduced in the Y730F crystals when crystallised under identical conditions. These two cysteines are, however, far from the substituted tyrosine, and there is no obvious interaction between the reduced cysteinyl residues and phenylalanine 730. This interesting feature will be further explored in a separate study. The inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity by mutated R1 proteins was used to study the kinetics of R1-R2 complex formation. The inhibition constants (Ki) for Y730F and Y731F were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots. All parameters for the R1-R2 interactions are summarized in Table I. Both mutant proteins are able to bind R2, and only a small difference in Ki values is observed between the mutant proteins and the wild type. The apparent R1-R2 binding constant for the wild type is approximately 0.11 µM (13Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4801-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and the differences in the mutant proteins could reflect either the position of mutated residues per se or a perturbed holoenzyme conformation induced by the mutation. The weaker binding between Y731F and R2 may reflect that exchange of this residue which is located close to the R1-R2 interaction area, affects the interaction in a negative way. The stronger binding between R1 Y730F and R2 could be due to a small structural change caused by R1-R2 complex formation or by the loss of the hydroxyl group in the 730 position. However, the differences in binding strength are small and are not, per se, likely to cause any significant changes in the enzymatic activity.TABLE IKinetic constants for inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity by mutated R1 proteinR1 inhibitor proteinConcentrationKappKiµMY730F00.0910.0660.2260.2640.4681.0561.7080.074Y731F00.1370.0660.2060.2640.3540.5280.4830.242 Open table in a new tab We also tested the mutant proteins for ability to bind substrate. The GDP binding data presented in Table II show that both mutant proteins have Kd values similar to that of the wild-type protein (21Ormö M. Sjöberg B.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). From this, we conclude that the substrate binding is not affected by the mutations.TABLE IIBinding of the substrate GDP to the mutant and wild-type R1 proteinsR1 proteinKdµMWild type26Y730F24Y731F27 Open table in a new tab The specific activities of mutated and wild-type R1 proteins are summarized in Table III. The low but significant enzyme activity measured in the mutant preparations (1.6% of the wild-type activity) corresponds approximately to the estimated contaminating, chromosomally encoded, wild-type protein in preparations from MC1009/pTB1/pGP1-2 constructs (3Åberg A. Hahne S. Karlsson M. Larsson Å. Ormö M. Åhgren A. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12249-12252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the mutant proteins were almost certainly catalytically inactive.TABLE IIISpecific activity of mutant R1 proteinsR1 proteinunits/mgWild type1650Y730F26Y731F26 Open table in a new tab CzDP inactivation of ribonucleotide reductase was used to substantiate the lack of activity in the mutant proteins and to determine if the lack of activity is due to a disturbed electron transfer chain. CzDP is a suicidal substrate analogue that destroys the tyrosyl radical in a single half-reaction catalyzed by the holoenzyme (23Sjöberg B.-M. Gräslund A. Eckstein F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8060-8067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Thelander L. Larsson B. Hobbs J. Eckstein F. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1398-1405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30van der Donk W.A. Stubbe J. Gerfen G.J. Bellew B.F. Griffin G.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8908-8916Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A protein with an intact electron transfer chain will thus be captured in the substrate radical state, whereas a protein with a disturbed electron transfer chain will never reach this state because the tyrosyl radical is never reduced and the 3′-hydrogen atom of the substrate never abstracted. As can be seen from Fig. 2, incubation of isolated R2 protein with CzDP showed no measurable change in the radical signal during 6 h of incubation. The R2 radical of the R1-R2 wild-type complex is rapidly inactivated during the first 20 min of incubation with CzDP, and azidosubstrate radical is already observed after 18 s. In contrast, the mutant R1 proteins in a complex with R2 wild-type protein showed no formation of an azidosubstrate radical during the incubation and no loss of tyrosyl radical during the first 20 min of incubation (Fig. 2). Even after 6 h of incubation with either CDP or CzDP, approximately 40% of the radical remained. In a parallel incubation of wild-type holoenzyme with CDP, approximately 15% remained after 6 h of incubation (Fig. 2). We estimate that this nonspecific inactivation of the radical in the presence of CDP, and CzDP in the case of the mutant protein complexes, is 0.05% compared with the CzDP-dependent inactivation of the wild-type holoenzyme complex. Thus we conclude that the mutant R1 proteins are catalytically inert because each mutation disturbs the electron transfer. In an attempt to study whether the unpaired electron of protein R2 is delocalized over the entire proposed electron transfer pathway in the wild-type holoenzyme complex, we utilized the fact that the EPR signal of a normal protonated tyrosine residue will have a major doublet splitting, whereas that of methylene-deuterated tyrosine residues will collapse to a singlet (31Sjöberg B.-M. Reichard P. Gräslund A. Ehrenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6863-6865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type protein R2 prepared from overproducing cells grown in the presence of β,β-deuterated tyrosine was mixed with wild-type protein R1 containing normal protonated tyrosines in the presence of product and an allosteric effector nucleotide previously shown to promote holoenzyme complex formation (32Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4591-4601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The R2 preparation used contained 60% deuterated signal (Fig. 3). The resulting EPR spectrum of the R1-R2 mixture was indistinguishable from that of the isolated protein R2 preparation (Fig. 3) in regard to total radical content per R2 (0.59 versus 0.61) and fraction of deuterated signal (0.56 versus 0.60). This shows that there is no equilibration of the unpaired electron among the tyrosine residues in protein R1 in the R1-R2 complex. Since the yield of the unpaired spin was the same for the two samples, it is also not plausible that the electron equilibrates with any other type of residue in the complex prior to binding of the substrate. The presence of an electron transfer chain in ribonucleotide reductase was first proposed when the three-dimensional structure of the R2 protein was solved, and Nordlund et al. (9Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) pointed out that an array of three conserved residues connected the diiron site with the surface of the protein via hydrogen bonds. The subsequently solved three-dimensional structure of protein R1 substantiated this hypothesis since an analogous short array of hydrogen-bonded conserved residues connects Cys-439 of the active site with the surface of R1 (5Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In addition, modeling of a plausible complex of R1 and R2 brought the two arrays of hydrogen-bonded residues close in space (5Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), and it was suggested that a hydrogen-bonded network of nine conserved residues (cf. Fig. 1) constitutes an electron transfer chain through the holoenzyme (2Sjöberg B.-M. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acid & Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 192Google Scholar). To date, it has been shown that modification of four of these conserved residues in R2 (8Larsson Å. Sjöberg B.-M. EMBO J. 1986; 5(8): 2037-2040Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 13Climent I.

Chem. 1989; 264: 12249-12252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mao S.S. Yu G.X. Chalfoun D. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9752-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) leads to catalytically inert proteins. In related experiments, two corresponding residues in protein R2 from the mouse have also been shown to be enzymatically essential (15Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used the site-directed mutagenesis approach to find evidence for the involvement of the remaining two residues in R1, Tyr-730 and Tyr-731, in the electron transfer pathway in ribonucleotide reductase. An uncertainty connected with studies of this kind is that a correct hypothesis will yield an inactive mutant enzyme and that trivial explanations for the loss of enzyme activity have to be excluded. We therefore established that the three-dimensional structures of the mutant proteins Y730F and Y731F were unchanged and that the binding of substrate and R2 to the mutant proteins was unchanged compared with wild-type R1. With this knowledge, the most plausible explanation for the lack of enzyme activity and the lack of suicidal reaction in the presence of the substrate analogue CzDP is an interrupted electron transfer pathway in either mutant protein that is caused by the introduced mutational change. In summary, this means that all residues suggested to be involved in the electron transfer reaction in ribonucleotide reductase have been shown to be essential for catalysis. The distance between the radical in R2 and the active site in R1 is 30-40 Å (Fig. 1), which is the longest naturally occurring electron transfer described to date. According to current understanding of electron transfer theory (34Marcus R.A. Sutin N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 265-322Crossref Scopus (7688) Google Scholar), this implies an extremely slow transfer process. For distances longer than e.g. 25 Å, the rate of transfer would be considerably slower than 1 s−1 since the exponential coefficient of decay of electronic coupling (β (35Moser C.C. Keske J.M. Warncke K. Faris R.S. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1992; 355: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar)) is 1.4 Å−1 in several experimentally observed systems. The kcat of wild-type ribonucleotide reductase is, however, on the order of 4-11 s−1 (30van der Donk W.A. Stubbe J. Gerfen G.J. Bellew B.F. Griffin G.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8908-8916Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 36Eriksson S. Sjöberg B.-M. Hahne S. Karlström O. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6132-6138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and in studies with isotopically labeled substrates, Stubbe (37Stubbe J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 257-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) showed that the initial step of catalysis is not rate-limiting. Therefore it is not straightforward to describe the electron transfer in ribonucleotide reductase according to the theoretical model. The original theory describing electron transfer in proteins is based on a mechanical tunneling mechanism (34Marcus R.A. Sutin N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 265-322Crossref Scopus (7688) Google Scholar). A tunneling pathway is defined as a combination of interacting bonds, i.e. bonds sharing a common atom, hydrogen bonds, or atoms in van der Waals forces, that link donor with acceptor. It is characteristic of an electron tunneling process that the rate of electron transfer rapidly decreases with distance. The model suggests that the coupling decay across a hydrogen bond is approximately equivalent to that across two covalent bonds, and the decay across a typical space-jump is equivalent to that across 10 covalent bonds (38Beratan D.N. Betts J.N. Onuchic J.N. Science. 1991; 252: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Current understanding of a long range electron transfer mechanism is, however, still incomplete, and in a recent experimental study, no difference in the rate of transfer was observed between a covalent bond and a hydrogen bond in a model compound (39de Rege P.J.F.

The structural data on the two Tyr → Phe mutants show that there are no major changes in the three-dimensional structure and that the mutations do not affect the aromatic interaction. From this, we can conclude that conservation of the π-π interaction is not enough for electron transfer to occur. An explanation for the fast electron transfer rate in wild-type ribonucleotide reductase, in relation to the considerable distance between the tyrosyl radical in R2 and the active site in R1, would be that the radical was delocalized over the entire hydrogen-bonded pathway. In experiments with deuterium-labeled R2 protein and unlabeled R1 protein, we found, however, no indication of a delocalized electron in the resting R1-R2 wild-type complex. One feature of the Tyr → Phe mutations is an interrupted hydrogen-bonded network. This characteristic is in fact true for all mutant constructs affecting the electron transfer chain in ribonucleotide reductase. Perhaps a coupled proton/electron transfer process is essential and determines the rate of transfer in the catalytic process. We are grateful to M. Ormö for valuable discussions all through the work and to I. Climent for help with the R1-R2 interaction studies."
https://openalex.org/W1987817886,"Integrin-ligand binding causes conformational changes in the integrin, as evidenced by the increased expression of epitopes known as ligand-induced binding sites. Some monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognize ligand-induced binding sites stimulate ligand binding, possibly by stabilizing the ligand-occupied conformation of the integrin. Here we have investigated the effect of ligand recognition by α5β1 on the binding of a mAb that inhibits β1 integrin function (mAb 13). Ligand (fibronectin fragment or GRGDS peptide) decreased the binding of mAb 13 to α5β1. Analysis of this inhibition showed that at high ligand concentrations, approximately 50% of the total integrin bound mAb 13 with >50-fold lower affinity than in the absence of ligand. The concentration of ligand required for half-maximal inhibition of antibody binding was independent of antibody concentration, suggesting that ligand acts as an allosteric inhibitor of mAb 13 binding. Hence, ligand and mAb 13 did not appear to compete directly for binding to α5β1. The stimulatory anti-β1 mAb 9EG7 was found to increase the maximum level of ligand binding ∼2-fold, indicating that up to 50% of the total integrin could not bind ligand without 9EG7 stimulation. Analysis of mAb 13 binding in the presence of 9EG7 and ligand (i.e. maximal ligand occupancy) demonstrated that essentially all of the integrin bound mAb 13 with very low or zero affinity. Our results demonstrate that mAb 13 recognizes an epitope that is dramatically attenuated in the ligand-occupied form of α5β1. Hence, since mAb 13 preferentially recognizes the unoccupied conformation of the integrin, the antibody may inhibit ligand binding by stabilizing the unoccupied state of α5β1. In addition, we present evidence that the binding of mAb 13 to ligand-occupied α5β1 may also induce a conformational change in the integrin, resulting in the displacement of ligand."
https://openalex.org/W2023769707,"We describe here the kinetics of the interaction of GTP and GDP with the small GTP-binding proteins Rab5 and Rab7. It was possible to make use of the intrinsic fluorescence of these proteins, since Rab5 contains two and Rab7 three tryptophan residues, respectively. With both enzymes, there is a significant decrease in fluorescence on binding GTP and an increase on binding GDP. As with the small GTP-binding protein Ha-Ras p21 and with EF-Tu, nucleotide binding occurs in at least two steps and is describable in terms of a relatively weak initial interaction followed by a highly irreversible isomerization of the protein-nucleotide complex, which results in a change in the fluorescence properties. Dissociation of GDP and GTP could be followed in a time-dependent manner using fluorescently labeled GDP (methylanthraniloyl GDP) as displacing agent and taking advantage of substantial fluorescent energy transfer from tryptophan to the nucleotide. Fluorescence techniques could also be used to quantitate the interaction of Mg2+ ions with the GTP and GDP forms of Rab7, and it was shown that the metal ion was bound ∼1000-fold more strongly to the GTP than the GDP form. The rate of GTP cleavage by the two proteins differed by a factor of ∼20 (2 × 10−3 s−1 for Rab5 and 9 × 10−4 s−1 for Rab7 at 37°C). Both proteins showed significant discrimination against xanthosine 5′-O-diphosphate (Kd ∼103-fold higher than that of GDP) and dramatic discrimination against ADP or ATP (Kd ∼106-fold higher than that of GDP).

The results demonstrate a high degree of mechanistic similarity between the Rab proteins and other GTP-binding proteins, which have been examined in detail, including Ha-Ras p21, Ran, and EF-Tu. The Rab proteins are members of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins. They are involved in protein trafficking in the cell and have been implicated in the mechanisms by which transport vesicles identify and fuse with their target compartment (1Novick P. Brennwald P. Cell. 1993; 75: 597-601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 2Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 3Zerial M.

Like the other members of the Ras superfamily, and in common with other classes of GTP-binding proteins, they cycle between the GTP- and GDP-bound forms and appear to share at least some of the general properties of the family, including interaction with nucleotide exchange factors (Refs. 5Ullrich O.

A class of molecules which appear to be critical for the role of Rab proteins are GDP dissociation inhibitors, which bind Rabs that are prenylated (doubly geranylgeranylated near the C terminus) in a specific manner and deliver them to their respective membranes, as well as retrieving them from these locations (11Pfeffer S.R. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17057-17059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A related molecule, the Rab escort protein (REP), is necessary for prenylation of Rabs (catalyzed by a geranylgeranyltransferase) and is also involved in delivery to, and retrieval of Rabs from, membrane compartments (12Andres D.A.

Other molecules that interact with Rab proteins have also been identified. These include rabphilin-3A, which is a putative target of Rab3A/3C in synaptic vesicles and appears to be involved in neurotransmitter release (13Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S.

This protein interacts with Rab5 in a GTP-dependent manner and appears to be essential for early endosome fusion (15Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar).

In comparison to the intensively investigated Ras protein, relatively little information is available at the molecular level on the structure of Rabs and their GTPase cycle. In the present paper we describe fluorescence methods for the detailed investigation of the interaction of nucleotides with Rab5 and Rab7 and discuss the results in relation to the recently determined three-dimensional structure of Rab7. 2P. Metcalf, manuscript in preparation. The results show a striking similarity between the Rab molecules and other members of the Ras superfamily. In particular, for both GTP and GDP, interaction with the nucleotide-free protein can be described as an initial weak, rapid binding followed by a quasi-irreversible isomerization of the protein-nucleotide complexes. Spontaneous dissociation of both GDP and GTP is extremely slow, suggesting very tight regulation of the activity of the Rab proteins. The quantitative results form the basis for understanding the mode of action of Rab molecules both at the mechanistic and cell biological levels. DNA fragments containing the coding regions of Rab5 and Rab7 DNAs (16Chavrier P. Vingron M. Sander C. Simons K. Zerial M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6578-6585Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) were obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the oligonucleotides AGTCGGATCCATATGGCTAATCGAGGAGCAACAAGA (Rab5) and AGTCGGATCCATATGACCTCTAGGAAGAAAGTGTTG (Rab7) in combination with the SP6 primer and pGEM-Rab5 and pGEM-Rab7 as the templates, respectively. In the case of Rab5, the amplified DNA fragments was cut with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into the corresponding sites of the pET3a vector (17Studier W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). The Rab7 DNA fragment was cut with KpnI, the ends polished with T4 DNA polymerase and restricted with NdeI, and inserted into the pET3a vector. To do this, the plasmid was cut with BamHI and, after filling in the protruding ends with Escherichia coli Klenow fragment, with NdeI. Protein expression was in E. coli BL 21 (DE3) cells at 37°C. 50 g of cells in which Rab7 expression had been induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside were suspended in would of a buffer containing 64 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.5), 8 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithioerythritol, 10 µM NaN3 and treated for 1 h at 4°C with Lysozyme (200 mg), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mM), and EDTA (2 mM) were included as protease inhibitors. 4% Sodium-desoxycholate (7 ml) was then added, followed after 10 min by 20 mg of DNase I and 10 mM MgCl2. After ∼1 h, cell fragments were removed by centrifugation at 17,700 × g for 30 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was applied to a column of Q-Sepharose (600 ml) equilibrated with the buffer described above for cell lysis. After washing with 1 column volume, the column was developed with a linear gradient from 0 to 200 NaCl (10 column volumes). Rab7 was eluted between 50 and 100 mM NaCl. Detection and identification were achieved by Western blotting and a GDP filter binding test (18Tucker J. Sczakiel G. Feuerstein J. John J. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Pooled fractions containing Rab7 were dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4), and precipitated protein material was removed by centrifugation. A second chromatographic procedure was performed on a column (300 ml) of S-Sepharose, which was developed with 10 column volumes of a linear gradient of 0-600 NaCl in sodium acetate buffer. After identification and pooling of fractions containing Rab7, they were dialyzed overnight against a buffer that was identical to the buffer used for cell lysis except that the pH was adjusted with HCl to 7.6. Ammonium sulfate was added to a concentration of 2.4 M, and precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation. The pellet was dissolved in the buffer used for the last dialysis and applied to a Superdex 75 column (330 ml). After elution with the same buffer and identification of Rab7, the protein solution was concentrated (Amicon or Zentriprep) to ∼10 mg/ml. The yield of homogeneous protein (SDS-electrophoresis) was ∼50 mg. Purification of Rab5 was as described (19Steele-Mortimer O. Clague M.J. Huber L.A. Chavrier P. Gorvel J.-P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) except that the protein was further purified by gel filtration as described above for Rab7. Methylanthraniloyl derivatives of GDP and GTP were prepared as described (20John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Nucleotides were separated analytically by HPLC as described previously (18Tucker J. Sczakiel G. Feuerstein J. John J. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 20John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The tightly bound GDP present in purified samples of Rab7 and Rab5 could be exchanged against other nucleotides (GTP, GppNHp, mantGTP/GDP) in the presence of EDTA, followed by gel filtration to remove excess nucleotide. Removal of tightly bound GDP without replacement by another nucleotide was performed essentially as described previously for Ha-ras p21 (20John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Since the rate of GDP release from the Rab proteins is even slower than for Ras, more care had to be taken to ensure removal of excess Mg2+, which slows down the rate of nucleotide dissociation. This was achieved by incubation of the protein with 10 mM EDTA prior to passage over a Sephadex PD-10 G-25 column to remove excess EDTA, since this would otherwise inhibit the enzymes used for removal of GDP. After addition of a 10-fold excess of GppCH2p over protein to this solution, it was brought to 200 mM with respect to ammonium sulfate, and 5 units/mg of phosphodiesterase-free alkaline phosphatase were added. Disappearance of GDP was monitored by HPLC, and typically 24 h at 18°C, were needed for complete degradation to guanosine. Phosphodiesterase (5 units/mg) was then added, and the incubation continued at 15°C until the GppCH2p was also degraded to guanosine. The resulting solution could be shock-frozen and stored at −80°C. Before use, precipitated guanosine was removed by centrifugation, and if neccessary, remaining guanosine was removed by gel filtration. Fluorescence spectra and long time fluorescence measurements (GTPase or nucleotide dissociation reactions) were performed with an SLM 8000 spectrophotometer (Aminco, Silver Spring, MD). Rapid kinetics were measured with a stopped flow apparatus (High Tech Scientific, Salisbury, United Kingdom) with protein concentrations of 0.5-1.0 µM. Excitation of tryptophan fluorescence was at 290 nm, with detection through a 320 nm cut-off filter. Fluorescence of mantGDP was excited either directly at 370 nm or via FRET at 290 nm, with emission through a 389 nm cut-off filter. Data collection and primary analysis for determination of rate constants were performed with the package from High Tech Scientific, while secondary analysis was with the program Grafit 3.0 (Erithacus software). GTP hydrolysis was assayed as a function of time by HPLC on a C18 reversed phase column in the presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide under isocratic conditions (18Tucker J. Sczakiel G. Feuerstein J. John J. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). After performing an exchange reaction (GTP against GDP) as described above, the GTPase reaction was started by addition of 10 mM Mg2+ at 37°C, and aliquots were analyzed at appropriate time intervals. To examine the dissociation kinetics of GTP simultaneously with (i.e. in competition with) GTP hydrolysis, a 40-50-fold excess of GDP was added a few seconds after starting the reaction with MgCl2. Fluorescence measurements of GTPase activity were performed in a fluorescence spectrophotometer, with excitation at 290 nm, detecting emission at 340 nm in 40 mM Hepes buffer at pH 7.5. The reaction was started by addition of 10 mM MgCl2 at 37°C. A prerequisite for a detailed transient kinetic investigation of the interaction of an enzyme with its substrate is the availability of relatively large amounts of protein without a bound ligand at its active site. While bacterial expression systems have been developed over the past few years for a number of small GTP-binding proteins, the proteins are isolated invariably with a stoichiometric amount of strongly bound GDP at the active site, which makes detailed investigations of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, or even the measurement of the affinity to GDP, difficult (21Goody R.S. Frech M. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 327-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A method that was originally developed to prepare nucleotide-free Ha-Ras p21 was used to prepare nucleotide-free Rab5 and Rab7 (20John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The basic principle of this method is that GDP is replaced by the less strongly bound GTP analog, GppCH2p, while GDP is degraded by alkaline phosphatase. In a second step, the GTP analog is degraded to GMP by phosphodiesterase, the GMP being then further degraded by alkaline phosphatase to guanosine. The low affinity of guanosine (20John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) means that the protein preparation can be regarded as ligand-free, even without separation from guanosine. Application of the procedure outlined here to Rab5 and Rab7 was successful, but only if particular care was taken to reduce the free Mg2+ concentration as far as possible. The much slower rate of GDP release of the Rab proteins compared with Ras (see below) leads to longer incubation times for both steps of the preparation, and this can lead to difficulties because of the limited stability of the nucleotide-free proteins. To shorten the incubation times, advantage is taken of the known Mg2+ dependence of the rate of nucleotide release from complexes with the small GTP-binding proteins (22John J. Rensland H. Schlichting I. Vetter I. Borasio G.D. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 923-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since divalent metal chelaters cannot be used because of their inhibition of alkaline phosphatase, the free magnesium concentration is reduced as far as possible by gel filtration in a Mg2+-free buffer (see “Materials and Methods”). Rigorous application of this procedure, together with careful control of temperature during the procedure, led to the production of high yields of nucleotide-free Rab5 and Rab7, and these could be used for investigations of the association reactions of the proteins with GTP and GDP. Most of the detailed work reported here is for the protein Rab7, which was available in larger quantities than Rab5. However, a number of key experiments were also performed with the latter protein and are described here. In contrast to Ha-Ras p21, both Rab proteins have tryptophan residues (positions 75 and 114 in Rab5; positions 62, 102, and 142 in Rab7; the first two are in structurally equivalent positions). These are situated 15, 8.4, and 18.3 Å (residues 62, 102, and 142, respectively, in Rab7) from the γ-phosphate of GppNHp in its complex with Rab7 3P. Metcalf, personal communication. and offer a potential signal for observing the interaction of the proteins with substrates and effectors. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the fluorescence emission spectra of nucleotide-free Rab5 and Rab7 are changed significantly on interaction with GTP or GDP. For both proteins, there is an increase in fluorescence yield on interaction with GDP (17% for Rab5 and 28% for Rab7) and a decrease on interaction with GTP (30% for Rab5 and 10% for Rab7). The maximum is shifted from 337 nm in the nucleotide-free proteins and the GTP complex to 340 nm in the GDP complexes. The fluorescence signals were stable for many hours at 25°C in the GDP state, but begin to decrease noticeably after ∼1 h in the nucleotide-free state. As discussed later, the transition from the GTP to the GDP form could be easily followed using the large (∼50% in Rab5 and 40% in Rab7) change in fluorescence yields. Methylanthraniloyl (mant) derivatives of guanosine nucleotides have been used extensively for studies on GTP-binding proteins (20John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In general, their fluorescence yield increases significantly on interaction with GTP/GDP binding sites, and this appears to be due at least in part to relief of quenching interactions of the fluorescent moiety with the guanine base, since the mant group on the ribose extends away from the base when guanosine nucleotide derivatives are bound to Ras (28Goody R.S.

Lautwein A. Pai E.F. Corrie J.E.T. Reid G. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 512-520Google Scholar). Binding of mant guanosine nucleotides to the Rab proteins also leads to a substantial increase in fluorescence yield (∼100%), so that this can be used as a signal of binding. The presence of tryptophans in the proteins offers the opportunity of observation of fluorescence energy transfer between these residues and the methylanthraniloyl group. As shown in Fig. 2, there is substantial energy transfer in the Rab7·mantGDP complex, as shown by both the decrease in tryptophan fluorescence and the increase in mant fluorescence in comparison with the protein GDP complex and with free mantGDP, respectively (excitation at 290 nm). For Rab5, the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by mantGDP at the active site is even more pronounced than for Rab7 (data not shown), suggesting that the energy transfer is mainly from residues 62 and 102 in the Rab7 structure and not from Trp142, which has no equivalent in Rab5. The nucleotide-free proteins were used to investigate the kinetics of nucleotide association. A typical stopped-flow trace is shown for the association of GDP to Rab7 using intrinsic fluorescence as a signal (Fig. 3). The curve could be fitted by a single exponential term, and increasing the concentration of GDP led, initially, to an approximately linear increase in the pseudo-first order rate constant. At higher concentrations, the rates departed from linearity and the data could be fitted by a hyperbolic curve (Fig. 4A). This behavior is typical of a two-step binding mechanism in which initial binding is weak and rapid, and this is followed by a second step occurring at a relatively slow rate in which the fluorescence change occurs. The equation relating the pseudo-first order rate constant to the GDP concentration (assuming an excess of GDP over protein) is kobs=k+21+1/K1(GDP+k−2(Eq. 1) for the following scheme.

The maximum rate reached at high GDP concentration gives a value for k+2, which is 80 s−1in this case. This can be compared with a value of ∼20 s−1for Ha-Ras p21 based on a similar analysis (20John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S.

This is found to be 4.2 × 104 M−1. The effective second order rate constant for GDP binding at nonsaturating GDP concentrations (K1× k+2) is 3.35 × 106 M−1 s−1, which is similar to the value for Ha-Ras p21. A similar analysis could be made of the association kinetics of GTP to Rab7. The results are shown in Fig. 4B, and it can be seen that in this case the limiting rate, defining k+2, is, at 32 s−1, significantly slower than for GDP. However, the affinity in the first association step (K1) is considerably higher than for GDP, so that the effective second order rate constant is higher than that for GDP (Table I).TABLE IAssociation and dissociation kinetics of Rab7 and nucleoside di- and triphosphates at 20°CNucleotideAssociation, K1k+2konDissociation, konAffinity, Ka×× 10−4 M−1s−1× 10−6 m−1 s−1× 105 s−1× 10−10 M−1GDP4.2803.350.842GTP18.3325.95160XDP445.71.833200.057ADP0.181130.211,070,0000.000002ATP0.8524.30.21800,0000.000003 Open table in a new tab Similar experiments were performed with nucleotide-free Rab5, and these also led to a hyperbolic dependence of rate against nucleotide (GTP or GDP) concentration. As can be seen from Table II, k+2 is similar for GTP and GDP in this case. The K1 values are also similar for the two nucleotides, but the values are significantly lower than for Rab7, so that the overall effective second order association rate constant is more than an order of magnitude lower than for Rab7.TABLE IIAssociation and dissociation kinetics of Rab5 and nucleoside di- and triphosphates at 20°CNucleotideAssociation, K1k+2konDissociation, konAffinity, Ka× 10−4 m−1s−1× 10−6 M−1× 105 s−1× 10−10 m−1GDP0.74280.210.63.5GTP0.86320.280.8 (GTPγS)3.5XDP0.177280.056000.0008ADP0.18200.036900,0000.0000004ATP0.475.50.026250,0000.000001 Open table in a new tab The analysis of the dependence of the observed rate constant for GDP or GTP binding to Rab5 and Rab7 presented here leads to the conclusion that the binding kinetics can be explained by a two-step mechanism. However, the overall amplitude of the fluorescence change for GDP binding to Rab7 was considerably higher (∼60%) than that seen in equilibrium experiments as shown in Fig. 1A (28% increase). While it is difficult to compare amplitudes in the stopped-flow and static spectrophotometers accurately because of different optical arrangements and efficiencies, it is highly unlikely that this difference of a factor of 2 is due to differences in machine performance. We checked whether the different excitation wavelengths used (290 nm for the static measurements, 296 nm for the dynamic measurements to reduce attenuation of the signal due to nucleotide absorption at high GDP concentrations) was of importance, but obtained identical amplitudes for the GDP-induced change at both wavelengths. We therefore conclude that there is probably a fluorescence change associated with the first binding step in the opposite direction (i.e. negative) to that in the second step, and that the large amplitude seen in the stopped-flow experiments is the net result of an initial drop in fluorescence within the dead time of the apparatus followed by an observable increase to the final level characteristic of the Rab7 GDP complex. The measurement of the dissociation rate constants of mantGDP from its complex with GTP-binding proteins can be conveniently measured by displacing the bound fluorescent nucleotide with a large excess of unlabeled nucleotide. The rate constant for release of the natural nucleotides is more difficult to measure spectroscopically, since addition of a large excess of mantGDP or mantGTP to a protein-GDP or -GTP complex produces a large background fluorescence if the mant group is excited directly at 350-370 nm. This problem is reduced significantly by using the energy transfer effect described in a previous section. Thus, a ∼20-50-fold excess of mantGDP can be added to a Rab. GDP complex, and on exciting at 290 nm with measurement of the fluorescence intensity at 440 nm, the increase in intensity can be used to monitor replacement of GDP by mantGDP, which is limited by the rate of GDP release under these conditions. The rate constant of GDP release from Rab7 was found to be 8 × 10−6 s−1 at 20°C, and 3.9 × 10−5 s−1 at 37°C (Rab5: 10−5 s−1 at 20°C, 4.3 × 10−5 s−1 at 37°C). These values are considerably lower than the rate constant of GDP dissociation from Ha-Ras p21 and explain the greater difficulty of preparation of the Rab proteins in the nucleotide-free state. Measurement of the dissociation rate of GTP is more comp"

In this paper we present the crystal structure of PHA-L, the L4 tetramer. PHA-L is a glycoprotein: each subunit is N-glycosylated at two different sites, with consensus sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr. The subunit possesses a high-mannose type glycan attached at Asn-12, and a complex type glycan at Asn-60 (Sturm and Chrispeels, 46Sturm A. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 320-322Crossref Google Scholar). The minimal structural unit for high-affinity binding by PHA-L is the pentasaccharide Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2[Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-6]Man, which is found in tetra- and tri-antennary complex type oligosaccharides of mammalian origin (Hammerström et al., 22Hammerström S.

In addition to the sugar binding properties of the legume lectins, a number of legume lectins also bind adenine and related ligands. High affinity binding sites for adenine and its derivatives have been found for PHA-E, Dolichos biflorus seed lectin (DBL), D. biflorus stem and leaves lectin (DB58), soybean agglutinin, and Phaseolus lunatus lectin (LBL) (Roberts and Goldstein, 39Roberts D.D.

https://openalex.org/W2053936578,"Rhodopsin is constrained in an inactive conformation by interactions with 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal including formation of a protonated Schiff base with Lys<sup>296</sup>. Upon photoisomerization, major structural rearrangements that involve protonation of the active site Glu<sup>113</sup> and cytoplasmic acidic residues, including Glu<sup>134</sup>, lead to the formation of the active form of the receptor, metarhodopsin II b, which decays to opsin. However, an activated receptor may be generated <i>without illumination</i> by addition of all-<i>trans</i>-retinal or its analogues to opsin, as measured in this study by the increased phosphorylation of opsin by rhodopsin kinase. The potency of stimulation depended on the chemical and isomeric nature of the analogues and the length of the polyene chain with all-<i>trans</i>-C17 aldehyde and all-<i>trans</i>-retinal being the most active and <i>trans</i>-C12 aldehyde being the least active. Certain c<i>is</i>-isomers, 11-<i>cis</i>-13-demethyl-retinal and 9-<i>cis</i>-C17 aldehyde, were also active. Most of the retinal analogues tested did not regenerate a spectrally identifiable pigment, and many were incapable of Schiff base formation (ketone, stable oximes, and Schiff base-derivatives of retinal). Thus, receptor activation resulted from formation of non-covalent complexes with opsin. pH titrations suggested that an equilibrium exists between partially active (protonated) and inactive (deprotonated) forms of opsin. These findings are consistent with a model in which protonation of one or more cytoplasmic carboxyl groups of opsin is essential for activity. Upon addition of retinoids, the partially active conformation of opsin is converted to a more active intermediate similar to metarhodopsin II b. The model provides an understanding of the structural requirements for opsin activation and an interpretation of the observed activities of natural and experimental opsin mutants."

The composition of fatty acids associated with IRBP in bovine retina was determined, and it was found that polyunsaturated fatty acids constitute a significant fraction of those.

The alteration is stable upon removal of ATP from the reaction or upon inhibition of activity by excess ATPγS, indicating that continued ATP hydrolysis is not required to maintain the altered nucleosome structure. This stable alteration is sufficient to facilitate binding of a transcriptional activator protein; concurrent ATP hydrolysis was not required to facilitate binding.

Previously, a set of mutants was selected that allow the passage of long maltodextrins that do not translocate through the wild-type pore. Here, we describe the crystal structures of four point mutants and one deletion mutant from this set; their functional characterization is reported in the accompanying paper (Saint, N., Lou, K.-L., Widmer, C., Luckey, M., Schirmer, T., Rosenbusch, J. P. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 20676-20680). All mutations have a local effect on the structure of the pore constriction and result in a larger pore cross-section. Substitution of each of the three closely packed arginine residues at the pore constriction (Arg-42, Arg-82, and Arg-132) by shorter uncharged residues causes rearrangement of the adjacent basic residues. This demonstrates mutual stabilization of these residues in the wild-type porin. Deletion of six residues from the internal loop (Δ109-114) results in disorder of seven adjacent residues but does not alter the structure of the β-barrel framework. Thus, the large hollow β-barrel motif can be regarded as an autonomous structure. OmpF porin is a nonspecific pore protein from the outer membrane of Escherichia coli.

Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein forms three large water-filled channels per trimer, allowing the diffusion of small hydrophilic molecules such as nutrients and waste products across the outer bacterial membrane (2Benz R. Bauer K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 3Buehler L.K. Kusumoto S. Zhang H. Rosenbusch J.P. J. Biol.

Several antibiotics, including β-lactams, use the porin pathway to cross the outer membrane and to find their targets (5Nikaido H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1989; 33: 1831-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the OmpF porin has been solved at 2.4 Å resolution (6Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Each monomer consists of a 16-stranded β-barrel that contains the channel. Six loops are exposed at the surface of the cell, and one is involved in subunit contact within the trimer. The longest loop, L3, is bent into the channel at a height corresponding to the center of the membrane, constricting the pore considerably. In this narrow region, a positively charged cluster, formed by basic residues that protrude from the barrel wall near the 3-fold molecular axis, faces two negatively charged acidic side chains located on L3 (see Fig. 1). This establishes a strong electrostatic field parallel to the membrane plane (7Karshikoff A. Spassov V. Cowan S.W. Ladenstein R. Schirmer T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The size and charge distribution of the pore constriction apparently allows the fine-tuning of the channel characteristics. A similar pore architecture and segregation of charge has been found for porins from photosynthetic bacteria (8Weiss M.S. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 493-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 9Kreusch A. Neubüser E. Schiltz E. Weckesser J. Schulz G.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) that lack sequence homology with OmpF porin. The x-ray structure of maltoporin, a porin specific for translocation of maltooligosaccharides, also exhibits a pore constriction, but there is no charge segregration (10Schirmer T. Keller T.A. Wang Y.-F. Rosenbusch J.P. Science. 1995; 267: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The pore properties of porins can be modified drastically by mutations at the pore constriction. By application of pertinent selection pressure, a colicin-resistant mutant with a single-residue replacement in loop L3 has been obtained (11Fourel D. Mizushima S. Bernadac A. Pages J.-M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2754-2757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that resulted in a considerably reduced pore cross-section (12Jeanteur D. Schirmer T. Fourel D. Simonet V. Rummel G. Widmer C. Rosenbusch J.P. Pattus F. Pages J.-M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10675-10679Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Benson and co-workers (13Benson S.A. Occi J.L.L. Sampson B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) selected OmpF porin mutants that were able to translocate long maltodextrins that do not pass through the wild-type protein. Growth tests, antibiotic sensitivities and rates of [14C]maltose uptake suggested enlargement of the pore size. Later, the x-ray structure of OmpF porin (6Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar) showed that all of the latter mutations had occurred at the pore constriction where, in each case, a specific side chain protruding into the channel was pruned, or part of the internal loop was deleted. Here, we report the crystal structures of five mutant proteins (R42C, R82C, R132P, D113G, and Δ109-114). In the accompanying paper, the functional changes of the mutant proteins are analyzed (14Saint N. Lou K.-L. Widmer C. Luckey M. Schirmer T. Rosenbusch J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20676-20680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The following E. coli strains were used: Top10 (Invitrogene); OC 1509, OC 5101, OC 5104, IB 910, and IB 915 (13Benson S.A. Occi J.L.L. Sampson B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used were: ompf-0, 5′-CTGCAGACACATAAAGACACCAAACTCTCA-3′; ompf-end, 5′-GTGCTATTAGAACTGGTAAACGATACCCAC-3′; S620, 5′-ACAGTTACGGTGGCAATG-3′; and S840, 5′-CGGTGTGGTTTATGATGC-3′. The procedures followed standard methods throughout (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviation used is: PCRpolymerase chain reaction. was carried out using Expand Long Template PCR System from Boehringer Mannheim according to recommendations of the manufacturer. The conditions used were: 92°C for 2 min for the first denaturation; subsequently 24 circles at 92°C for 10 s, at 65°C for 30 s, and finally at 68°C for 4 min. DNA sequencing was performed using the T7 Sequencing Kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. E. coli cells were grown overnight in 10 ml of 2YT medium to which either 10 µg/ml tetracycline (in the case of OC strains) or 50 µg/ml kanamycine (in the case of IB strains) were added. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in TE medium, and treated twice with phenol/chloroform mixture. The DNA was then precipitated with ethanol and redissolved in water in case of OC strains carrying mutations of the ompF gene in the chromosome. In the case of IB strains, low copy number plasmids were purified with Qiagen 5 columns. For PCR, either 10 ng of chromosomal or 1 ng of plasmid DNA were used. For PCR ompf-0 and ompf-end oligonucleotides were used to amplify the complete ompF gene. After digestion of the PCR-generated fragments (1208 base pairs) with restriction enzymes HincII and BglII, the resulting fragments (900 base pairs) were ligated with pGEM-7Zf(+) (Promega) cleaved with BamHI and SmaI. After transformation into E. coli Top10, all colonies from each plate were removed, and the plasmid DNA was purified. The fraction of blue colonies was about 30% for all plates. This mixtures of plasmids either containing or lacking the insertion were sequenced with ompF-specific oligonucleotides S620 and S840 to avoid possible errors caused by Taq-polymerase. The resulting sequence changes are summarized in Table I.TABLE ISequencing of OmpF MutantsName of strainOriginal descriptionChanges in DNA sequenceMutationOC 1509Δ108-114Δ109-114IB 910R42SCGT → TGTR42COC 5101R82CCGT → TGTR82COC 5104D113GGAT → GGTD113GIB 915R132PCGT → CCTR132P Open table in a new tab polymerase chain reaction. OmpF porin mutants, selected by demanding growth on maltodextrins (Dex+) in the absence of maltoporin (13Benson S.A. Occi J.L.L. Sampson B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), were grown as described (14Saint N. Lou K.-L. Widmer C. Luckey M. Schirmer T. Rosenbusch J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20676-20680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Extraction and purification were performed as described (16Garavito R.M. Rosenbusch J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 309-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The cells were broken using a French press, and envelopes were recovered by centrifugation. Porins were then treated by pre-extracting five times with a buffer containing 0.5% octyl-polyoxyethylene (Bachem), which eliminated the majority of contaminants. Five extraction steps with a buffer containing 3% octyl-polyoxyethylene allowed solubilization of the integral membrane proteins. Further purification was performed by ion-exchange chromatography (DEAE-cellulose, Merck), followed by chromatofocusing (PBE94, Pharmacia) and finally by gel filtration on Sephadex G-150 (Pharmacia). Purity was checked by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Crystallization of the porin mutants was performed as described for the wild type (17Pauptit R.A. Zhang H. Rummel G. Schirmer T. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 505-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The crystals diffracted to varying resolutions in the range of 2.7-3.5 Å and were of space group P321 with similar cell constants as the wild-type protein (Table II). Data were collected on a FAST area detector or an image plate detector (for mutant R82C) and processed by the programs MADNES (18Messerschmidt A. Pflugrath J.W. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab Trigonal crystals (space group P321) of the OmpF porin mutants were readily obtained using the established protocol for the wild-type protein (17Pauptit R.A. Zhang H. Rummel G. Schirmer T. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 505-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The structures were solved by the difference Fourier method at the resolutions listed in Table II. The initial low R-values (Table II), obtained with the wild-type OmpF model, indicated that all mutant crystals were virtually isomorphous to the wild-type crystals, except the deletion mutant Δ109-114. Remodeling was straightforward and crystallographic refinement resulted in models with good R-factors and stereochemistry (Table II). Restrained B-factor refinement was carried out only for those OmpF mutants for which a sufficient number of observations was available (R42C and R82C). Comparison of the models of all OmpF point mutants with that of the wild-type porin showed that the backbones of the mutant structures are virtually unchanged. After superposition, the respective root mean square differences between all Cα-positions are below the expected coordinate errors (mutant R42C, 0.10 Å; R82C, 0.09 Å; R132P, 0.13 Å; D113G, 0.06 Å). Comparison of the atomic B-factors of the models of mutants R42C and R82C with those of the wild-type protein showed no indication for increased flexibility of the main chains. In the wild-type porin, the side chains of arginines 42, 82, and 132 are stacked upon each other, forming the most tightly packed part of the pore constriction (Fig. 1). Substitution of each of these arginyl residues by shorter uncharged groups (R42C, R82C, and R132P) results in well defined, short range structural changes that break up the front line at the wall structure. In all cases, neighboring side chains bend toward the empty space left by the truncation of the long side chain (Figs. 2, a-c, and 3). The increase of the cross-sectional area at the height of the pore constriction is rather modest (5-7%; see e.g. Fig. 4a).Fig. 4Stereo diagrams of porin mutant R82C. a, 2Fo− Fc electron density (contoured at 1σ) with model superimposed. b, model of R82C with partial wild-type model superimposed. Only those side chains of the wild-type model that differ significantly from the mutant model (Arg-42, Lys-80, Arg-82, and Arg-132) are shown (in brown). Both conformations of Lys-80 are shown (see text). Magenta, major conformation with side chain amino group forming a salt-bridge with Cys-82 (see also a); yellow, minor conformation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In mutant R42C, the adjacent side chain of Arg-82 has changed its conformation and partly fills the space vacated by the mutation (Figs. 2a and 3). The mean side chain B-factor of Arg-82 has increased by 20 Å2 compared with the wild-type porin; all other B-factor changes are <10 Å2. The guanidinium group of Arg-82 sandwiched in the wild type between Arg-42 and Arg-132 (Fig. 1) is now within H-bonding distance (2.5 Å) to Cys-42. The mutation R82C does not change the conformation of the flanking arginines to a large degree (Figs. 2b and 4). However, Lys-80, which in the wild-type protein points upwards, has swung into the cleft and is within H-bonding distance (2.6 Å) to Cys-82, replacing the H-bond between Arg-82 and Glu-62 of the wild-type structure (Fig. 1). There is some indication for an alternative and less populated conformation of the side chain of Lys-80 (Fig. 4b) in which the side chain amino group is no longer in H-bonding distance to Cys-82 but exhibits a wild type-like conformation. Resequencing the mutant porin R132P confirmed the presence of a proline at position 132. The electron density rather suggests an asparagine, but because the resolution of the map is limited (3.3 Å), the assignment from the sequence is used. The side chains of three residues, Glu-71 from loop L2 of an adjacent subunit, Tyr-102, and especially Arg-82, are shifted. This also affects the mode of H-bonding interactions. The polar and ionic interactions, which are observed between the guanidinium group of Arg-132 and the side chains of Glu-71 and Tyr-102 in the wild-type porin, are replaced by an H-bond between Tyr-102 and Arg-82 in the mutant protein (Fig. 2c). The resolution for the structure of the mutant D113G is the worst among all mutants (Table II). Apart from the truncation of the side chain, no structural changes are apparent. In the wild-type porin residues 109-114 constitute part of the internal loop L3 (Fig. 1) and form a multitude of interactions with the barrel wall. This segment that is absent in the deletion mutant is not positioned at the tip of L3 in the wild type, and major rearrangements of the flanking segments were, therefore, anticipated in this mutant porin. The difference Fourier density (Fig. 5a) shows large positive and negative values at the positions of the deleted part and the adjacent stretch at its C-terminal side. In all other regions, and notably at the β-barrel wall, the density is low. This provides strong evidence that the large structural perturbation of the internal loop does not affect the structure of the framework. Indeed, after refinement the root mean square difference between the Cα-positions of the wild-type and the mutant porin carrying the deletion was only 0.24 Å. In particular, the residues N-terminal to the deleted region, i.e. all residues up to number 108, show wild-type conformation. Interestingly, the first two residues C-terminal to the deletion, Leu-115 and Pro-116, adopt approximately the positions of wild-type residues Leu-109 and Gly-110 at the C terminus of the small α-helix. The conformation of segment 117-123 is not defined by observed electron density and is probably highly disordered. From Tyr-124 to the C terminus, the structure shows again wild-type conformation (Figs. 2d, 5, and 6). The deletion of six residues and the resulting disorder of residues 117-123 increases the pore section by about 50% as defined by electron density (Fig. 5b), i.e. by ordered structure. The mutant selection procedure employed previously (13Benson S.A. Occi J.L.L. Sampson B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) has allowed the successful identification of residues and polypeptide segments that are critical in affecting the pore size in OmpF porin. Subsequently, the x-ray structure (6Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar) showed that all the mutations map to the constriction of the pore. The results of the mutation study thus demonstrate the prime role of this part of the molecule as a pore determinant. In the present study, we have determined the structures of five of these OmpF mutants by x-ray crystallography. The locally confined changes observed for all point mutations corroborates the earlier conclusion that the residues affected are directly involved in determining the pore size and are particularly responsible for the size limit of the maltooligosaccharides that can be translocated across the outer membrane. The increase of the cross-sectional area of the pore constriction appears, however, rather modest (<10%). Two possibilities for the altered permeation properties are 1) change of the flexibility of the structure, 2) change in the local electric field, or 3) both. In the case of the arginine mutations, an increased plasticity of the pore constriction is indeed to be expected, because the packing of the closely stacked guanidinium groups in the wild-type protein (Fig. 1) is perturbed. The close proximity of the arginine residues was expected to cause large shifts in their pK values, and calculations suggested an unusual charging behavior (7Karshikoff A. Spassov V. Cowan S.W. Ladenstein R. Schirmer T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Because the channel gating of OmpF porin has been shown to be pH-dependent (23Todt J.C. Rocque W.J. McGroarty E.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10471-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with a titration point at neutral pH, the arginine cluster may well be the titrating group (7Karshikoff A. Spassov V. Cowan S.W. Ladenstein R. Schirmer T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The confinement of the arginines into close proximity may, thus, have evolved to promote a shift of their pK values into a physiological relevant pH range. The electrostatic behavior of the arginine mutants is discussed in the accompanying article (14Saint N. Lou K.-L. Widmer C. Luckey M. Schirmer T. Rosenbusch J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20676-20680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) on the basis of their functional parameters. The confinement of the arginine residues is relieved by replacement of any one of them by a smaller side chain. Whereas in the case of mutants R42C or R132P the newly created space is taken by the adjacent arginine, in mutant R82C the flanking arginines Arg-42 and Arg-132 keep essentially their native conformation. This contrasting behavior can be explained by the mutual repulsion of the positively charged guanidinium groups. In both of the mutants in which cysteine residues were introduced (R42C and R82C), H-bonds between the cysteine sulfhydryl groups and a neighboring basic side chain were found. It is likely that in both cases the positively charged environment lowers the in situ pK values of the sulfhydryl group and that the cysteine is present in its anionic form and participates in an ion pair interaction (Cys-42-Arg-82 and Cys-82-Lys-80). A salt bridge between a lysine and a cysteine residue has recently been found in human glutathione transferase (24Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Mazzetti A.P. Board P.G. Muramatsu M. Federici G. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1249-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The cysteine residues at the pore constriction appear to be well suited for covalent attachment of groups that may block the channel or report atomic motions in spectroscopic studies. The deletion mutant Δ109-114 shows a major disordering of a 7-residue segment (residues 117-123). Hence, a total of 13 residues that are ordered in the wild-type structure are missing in the electron density map and the pore size appears considerably increased (Fig. 5b). Although the crystal structure can yield no information about the obstruction to permeation caused by the disordered segment, ion conductance and transport studies of this mutant reveal significant differences with respect to the wild-type porin (14Saint N. Lou K.-L. Widmer C. Luckey M. Schirmer T. Rosenbusch J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20676-20680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In wild-type OmpF porin there are two completely buried and uncompensated acidic groups (Glu-296 and Asp-312) that are in H-bonding distance with respect to each other (Fig. 1). Their side chains, originating from the β-barrel, are covered by the internal loop. Electrostatic calculations based on the x-ray model of wild-type porin predicted (7Karshikoff A. Spassov V. Cowan S.W. Ladenstein R. Schirmer T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) that both groups are protonated, i.e. uncharged, at neutral pH. In the deletion mutant, these acidic residues are exposed (Fig. 2d) and are, in fact, no longer H-bonded to each other (25Lou, K.-L., 1996, Crystal Structural Analyses of OmpF Porin Mutants Selected for Large Pore Sizes. Ph.D. Thesis, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.Google Scholar). It is likely that the groups assume normal pK values in the mutant and that the charged carboxylates repel each other. It has been proposed (7Karshikoff A. Spassov V. Cowan S.W. Ladenstein R. Schirmer T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) that in wild-type porin, the closed state of the channel may be defined by an alternative conformation of the internal loop, which would also lead to the exposure of these acidic groups and concomitant liberation of electrostatic energy. The involvement of the only histidine present in the OmpF sequence (His-21), which is located at the outer surface of the barrel, as a candidate for the pH sensor (26Todt J.C. McGroarty E.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10479-10482Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) can be ruled out, because a His-21 → Thr mutant shows wild-type behavior (14Saint N. Lou K.-L. Widmer C. Luckey M. Schirmer T. Rosenbusch J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20676-20680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Also, the x-ray structure of this mutant, though revealing distinct changes around the site of mutation, does not show alterations at the channel lining (25Lou, K.-L., 1996, Crystal Structural Analyses of OmpF Porin Mutants Selected for Large Pore Sizes. Ph.D. Thesis, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.Google Scholar). It is interesting that the OmpF deletion mutant maintains the structure of the hollow β-barrel framework. It appears unlikely that this is caused by trapping of the structure in the wild-type crystal lattice. The structure of the barrel thus appears to be ensured by the main chain H-bonds, the packing of side chains, and the stabilization by the extensive contact with the neighboring barrels in the trimeric aggregate. However, the lack of the internal loop as a brace decreases the thermal stability by 20 degrees. 2P. Phale and C. Widmer, unpublished results. The notion that transmembrane channels are formed by simple motifs, such as helical bundles or β-barrels, and are supplemented by selectivity and gating loops seems attractive. In OmpF and PhoE porins there is a single constricting loop (L3) oriented parallel to the plane of the membrane (6Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). In maltoporin, a channel specific for maltooligosaccharides, a similar constriction is further narrowed by the contribution of two additional loops (10Schirmer T. Keller T.A. Wang Y.-F. Rosenbusch J.P. Science. 1995; 267: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Although no high resolution structures are currently available for ion-specific channels, related arrangements have been suggested (for a review, see Ref. 27MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 889-892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether similar or different structural principles are involved in channel-forming transmembrane proteins in general. The technical assistance by Y.

To address the metabolic impact of increasing glucose phosphorylation capacity in liver, rat primary hepatocytes were treated with recombinant adenoviruses containing the cDNAs encoding either rat liver glucokinase (AdCMV-GKL) or rat hexokinase I (AdCMV-HKI). Maximal glucose phosphorylation in AdCMV-GKL- and AdCMV-HKI-treated hepatocytes was increased 7.1 ± 1.2- and 6.3 ± 0.8-fold, respectively, over hepatocytes treated with an adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase. Glucose usage (measured with 3 and 20 mM 2-[3H]glucose and 5-[3H]glucose) was significantly increased in AdCMV-GKL-treated cells preincubated in 1 or 25 mM glucose. Treatment of hepatocytes with AdCMV-HKI also caused enhanced glucose utilization, but the increases were smaller and were less apparent in cells preincubated in high (25 mM) glucose. AdCMV-GKL-treated hepatocytes incubated for 48 h in the presence of variable glucose concentrations had glycogen levels that were maximally 15.0 ± 0.6-fold greater than levels in corresponding control cells. AdCMV-HKI-treated hepatocytes incubated under similar conditions had unchanged glycogen levels relative to controls. In AdCMV-GKL-treated cells, lactate output was increased to a maximum of 3.0 ± 0.4-fold (at 25 mM glucose), glucose oxidation was increased 3.5 ± 0.3-fold, and triglyceride production was unchanged relative to untreated cells. Among these three parameters, only lactate production was increased in AdCMV-HKI-treated cells, and then only at low glucose concentrations.

https://openalex.org/W1998338339,"To study the function of side chain oligosaccharides of the cell-surface lipophosphoglycan (LPG), mutagenized <i>Leishmania major</i> defective in side chain biosynthesis were negatively selected by agglutination with the monoclonal antibody WIC79.3, which recognizes the galactose-containing side chains of <i>L. major</i> LPG. One such mutant, called Spock, lacked the ability to bind significantly to midguts of the natural <i>L. major</i> vector, <i>Phlebotomus papatasi</i>, and to maintain infection in the sand fly after excretion of the digested bloodmeal. Biochemical characterization of Spock LPG revealed its structural similarity to the LPG of <i>Leishmania donovani</i>, a species whose inability to bind to and maintain infections in <i>P. papatasi</i> midguts has been strongly correlated with the expression of a surface LPG lacking galactose-terminated oligosaccharide side chains. An <i>in vitro</i> galactosyltransferase assay using wild-type or Spock membranes was used to determine that the defect in Spock LPG biosynthesis is a result of defective β1,3-galactosyltransferase activity as opposed to a modification of LPG, which would prevent it from serving as a competent substrate for galactose addition. The results of these experiments show that Spock lacks the β1,3-galactosyltransferase for side chain addition and that the LPG side chains are required for <i>L. major</i> to bind to and to produce transmissible infection in <i>P. papatasi.</i>"

These cells secrete prorenin constitutively and sort a portion of the prorenin to secretory granules, where it is converted to active renin by proteolytic processing. Pulse-chase labeling of transfected AtT-20 cells demonstrated that regulated secretion of prorenin was prevented by: 1) the mutagenic deletion of the prosegment, 2) the premature proteolytic removal of the prosegment by a Golgi-resident processing protease, or 3) the mutation of the native cleavage site so as to prevent removal of the prosegment. In addition, expression of fusion proteins containing portions of the prorenin prosegment demonstrated that exposure of potential proteolytic cleavage sites was sufficient to confer cleavage-dependent regulated secretion of the corresponding protein.

https://openalex.org/W2061192472,"Gelsolin nucleates actin filament assembly, blocks the fast-exchanging ends of actin filaments, and severs filaments, processes that may play an important role in cell motility. We studied the relationship between cell migration, gelsolin content, and actin severing activity in human gingival fibroblasts. These cells were keratin negative and desmin negative but expressed vimentin and myosin II. Cells were separated by their ability to migrate in response to a chemoattractant stimulus. Northern analysis of mRNA, [35S]methionine incorporation into immunoprecipitated gelsolin, immunoblots of cell lysates, and quantitative confocal microscopy showed 1.4-2-fold higher levels of gelsolin in nonmigrant compared with migrant cells. Because the concentration of intracellular gelsolin did not appear to be a central determinant of cell migration, we assessed its requirement for motility. Cells that were electroinjected with a gelsolin antibody that inhibits actin severing by gelsolin in vitro showed a 72% reduction of the number of migrant cells compared with controls treated with an irrelevant antibody. Cells that were electroinjected with free gelsolin exhibited a 33% increase in migration compared with cells electroinjected with bovine serum albumin. Compared with nonmigrant cells, migrant cells contained abundant free gelsolin and exhibited gelsolin-dependent F-actin severing activity, which required Ca2+.

In fibroblasts, gelsolin concentration alone does not apparently determine migratory capacity. Instead, the Ca2+-dependent actin severing activity of free gelsolin appears to be a major determinant of cell migration. Studies from a wide variety of organisms have shown that a large number of proteins interact with actin to augment the versatility of actin filament structures and contribute to the dynamics of actin filament rearrangements (1Stossel T.P. Chaponnier C. Ezzell R.M. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lind S.E. Smith D.B. Southwick F.S. Yin H.L. Zaner K.S. Annu. Rev.

Consequently these actin-binding proteins are likely to play important roles in regulating cell motility, cell differentiation, and cell shape. One such protein that has major effects on actin assembly/disassembly cycles and on actin filament architecture is gelsolin (3Yin H.L. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1979; 281: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), a Ca2+- and polyphosphoinositide-regulated multifunctional actin-binding protein (4Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) that severs actin filaments, nucleates actin filament assembly, and blocks the fast exchanging end of actin filaments (5Yin H.L. Bioessays. 1987; 7: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Gelsolin-actin complexes form transiently during the activation of neutrophils (6Howard T. Chaponnier C. Yin H. Stossel T. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), macrophages (7Chaponnier C. Yin H.L. Stossel T.P. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and platelets (8Lind S.E. Janmey P.A. Chaponnier C. Herbert T. Stossel T.P. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 9Kurth M.C. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7473-7479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the activation process is associated with the shuttling of gelsolin between membrane-bound and cytoplasmic sites (10Hartwig J.H. Chambers K.A. Stossel T.P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Among the actin-modulating functions exhibited by gelsolin, severing of filaments has the most stringent Ca2+ requirement (11Harris H.E. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2728-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12Bryan J. Coluccio L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1236-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Functional studies indicate that gelsolin has two actin-binding sites (13Bryan J. Kurth M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7480-7487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of Ca2+, a 2:1 actin-gelsolin complex is formed. Chelation of free Ca2+ with EGTA releases actin from one site only, resulting in the formation of an EGTA-resistant 1:1 actin-gelsolin complex (13Bryan J. Kurth M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7480-7487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which can be dissociated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (4Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). There are two types of gelsolin. Both the secreted form (plasma gelsolin) and the cytoplasmic form are derived from a single gene by alternate initiation sites and differential splicing (14Kwiatkowski D.J. Mehl R. Yin H. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although the cytoplasmic form almost certainly contributes to the dynamics of actin structure, the plasma form may be important in clearing actin complexes and cell debris from blood vessels (15Lee W.M. Galbraith R.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 1335-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The abundant distribution of gelsolin in Xenopus laevis oocytes suggests a role in embryogenesis (16Ankenbauer T. Kleinschmidt J.A. Vanderkerckhove J. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and gelsolin content increases during differentiation of murine carcinoma cells (17Diffenbach C.W. SenGupta D.N. Krause D. Sawzak D. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13281-13288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, gelsolin expression is also down-regulated during chicken erythroid differentiation (18Hinssen H. Vanderkerckhove J. Lazarides E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown a relationship between gelsolin content and cell migration. For example increasing gelsolin content in cultured mouse fibroblasts by transfection proportionally enhances the rate of cell migration toward a chemoattractant serum gradient (19Cunningham G.C. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Science. 1991; 251: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Large increases in gelsolin content are also associated with the enhanced motility exhibited during differentiation of myeloid cell lines into macrophage-like cells (20Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13857-13862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, other investigators have shown that high gelsolin content may be associated with reduced cell migration (21Chaponnier C. Kocher O. Gabbiani G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 134: 597-603PubMed Google Scholar). Further, the motility of Dictyostellium mutants that lack this severing protein is normal (23André E. Brink M. Gerisch G. Isenberg G. Noegel A. Scheicher M. Segall J.E. Walraff E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 985-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and transgenic mice lacking gelsolin expression exhibit normal motility of embryonic fibroblasts (24Witke W. Sharpe A.H. Hartwig J.H. Azuma T. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cell. 1995; 81: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data indicate considerable cell-type dependence of gelsolin in migratory behavior, and the potential functional significance of how gelsolin expression is related to cell migration may be strongly affected by the differentiation state of the cell (17Diffenbach C.W. SenGupta D.N. Krause D. Sawzak D. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13281-13288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the relative abundance of gelsolin may not be the sole factor in determining its relationship to cell motility. Because the functional activities of gelsolin are highly regulated, conceivably it is not the total cellular content but the relative actin severing, nucleating, and binding activities of gelsolin that are responsible for the gelsolin-dependent variations in migration between motile and nonmotile cells. One alternative approach to study the role of gelsolin in motility is to correlate gelsolin expression in separate subpopulations of motile and nonmotile cells that arise from common precursors. In this context fibroblasts provide a useful model because they constitutively express largely cytoplasmic gelsolin (14Kwiatkowski D.J. Mehl R. Yin H. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and it is possible to select for differentiated subtypes in culture (25Bordin S. Pages R.C. Narayanan A.S. Science. 1984; 223: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Bayreuther K. Rodemnann H.P. Francz P.I. Maier K. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 10: 115-130Crossref Google Scholar, 27Bellows C. Melcher A.H. Aubin J. J. Cell Sci. 1981; 50: 299-314PubMed Google Scholar) including nonmotile cells (28Schor S.L. Schor A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1987; 8: 165-180Crossref Google Scholar). Notably, gingival fibroblasts spontaneously differentiate in culture as measured by filamentous actin content (29Pender N. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 187-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and α-smooth muscle actin expression (30Arora P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this study we have separated and characterized motile and nonmotile gingival fibroblasts and have examined the dependence of serum-induced migration on gelsolin expression, severing activity. Experiments were conducted using fourth to tenth passage human gingival fibroblasts grown from explants and maintained in cell culture as described (30Arora P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To obtain sufficient cell numbers for the various experiments performed in this study, migrant and nonmigrant cells were separated and assayed in a large, customized chemotactic chamber (16 × 16 cm; Mount Sinai Hospital Biomedical Engineering, Toronto, ON). In some experiments migration assays were also performed in conventional 48-well Boyden chambers (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD) as described (31Hughes F. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Postlethwaite A.E. Seyer J.M. Kang A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Prior to incubation with cells the polycarbonate membranes (8-µm pore size; Poretics Corporation, Livermore, CA) were treated with 0.01% acetic acid, washed, and coated with a 0.1% (w/v) collagen solution. Before incubation in chambers, cells were counted electronically (ZM Coulter counter, Hialeah, FL), and 3 × 106 cells were added to the large chamber and 5 × 104 cells/well for the smaller Boyden chamber. Cells were allowed to attach to filters in normal growth medium for 2 h. Filter-attached fibroblasts were thoroughly washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1The abbreviation used are: PBSphosphate-buffered salineBAPTA/AM1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)-esterFBSfetal bovine serumBSAbovine serum albuminSMAsmooth muscle actin. at 37°C, and the chamber was assembled. The chemoattractant solution consisted of αminimal essential medium containing antibiotics and 20% fetal bovine serum in the bottom chamber, whereas the top chamber contained α minimal essential medium and antibiotics only. The chambers were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2. At the end of the assay filters were thoroughly washed with PBS, and cells were collected by scraping into appropriate buffers for each experiment. phosphate-buffered saline 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)-ester fetal bovine serum bovine serum albumin smooth muscle actin. To establish the time at which all potentially migrant cells had migrated, timed chemotactic assays were performed in 48-well Boyden chambers. At 2, 6, 8, 16, and 24 h, the number of migrant cells was counted in a fluorescence microscope after staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 µg/ml; Sigma). Control wells were established without the chemoattractant gradient and contained normal growth medium without serum. To circumvent the dissipation of the chemotactic gradient, which occurs over longer incubation periods (15 h), the chemoattractant and medium in the chambers were replaced every 6 h. Following separation into migrant and nonmigrant cells, we characterized the separate populations by detaching cells from the upper and lower sides of the filters with mild trypsinization and replating in culture dishes containing normal growth medium. To determine the requirement for increases in [Ca2+]i for cell migration in the chemotactic assay, cells were loaded with or without (control) the intracellular calcium chelator 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)-ester (BAPTA/AM; 3 µM) in nominally calcium-free medium. The loaded cells were continuously exposed to BAPTA/AM during the assay, which was performed in a Boyden chamber at various time points as described above. Cell viability was assessed by staining with 0.4% trypan blue. To assess total gelsolin, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and were then lysed in an extraction buffer (19Cunningham G.C. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Science. 1991; 251: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) plus protease inhibitors (1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM leupeptin, and 1 mM aprotonin). Triton-soluble supernatants and triton-insoluble cytoskeletons (pellets) were fractionated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min at 4°C. Lysates were boiled in solubilizing buffer (10% SDS, 20% glycerol, 2% mercaptoethanol, Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) for 10 min, and equal amounts of each fraction were then separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Phast system; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Proteins on the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose paper (Schleicher & Schull), and gelsolin was identified by immunoblotting with an anti-gelsolin monoclonal antibody (clone 2C4, Sigma) and with horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG as a second antibody. To adjust for variations in gel loading and to provide a standard for quantification, blots were also probed for β-actin (Clone AC-15, Sigma). The blots were developed by a chemiluminescence method (ECL, Amersham Corp.), autoradiographed, and scanned for quantification of intensity. We examined whether the motility difference between the subpopulations was due to differences in the availability of free gelsolin and the complexing of gelsolin with actin. We quantified gelsolin that was associated with actin in the ultracentrifuged pellet and free gelsolin in the supernatant. Migratory and nonmigratory cells were collected from the polycarbonate filters and suspended in a nondetergent buffer (1 mM EGTA, 2 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1 µM phalloidin. Phalloidin at this concentration stabilizes F-actin. The freshly prepared cell lysate was pipetted several times with a narrow gauge pipette tip and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C (33Heacock C.S. Bamburg J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 135: 22-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The supernatant and pellet were collected, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted for detection of actin and gelsolin. The pellet contained gelsolin complexed with F-actin and was suspended in 0.1 M KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM ATP, 1 mM NaHCO3, and 1 mM NaNa3. Protein concentrations in the fractions were equalized. In separate experiments designed to assess the effect of serum stimulation on availability of free gelsolin, migrant and nonmigrant cells were separated, plated (2 each), and serum-deprived for 24 h. One plate from each group was incubated with 10% FBS for 20 min. Fresh lysates were collected from all four plates in a Triton buffer (19Cunningham G.C. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Science. 1991; 251: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) containing 1 mM EGTA and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C (33Heacock C.S. Bamburg J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 135: 22-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The supernatants were adjusted for equal protein loading, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted, and probed for actin and gelsolin. Gelsolin severing activity was performed essentially as described (35Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1986; 7: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 36Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4825-4831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity purified rabbit muscle actin (1.0 mg/ml; Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) was resuspended in polymerization buffer (50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM ATP, 2 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) and labeled with N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide. The molar ratio of the dye to actin was 1:1. The reaction was allowed to proceed in the dark overnight. Unreacted dye was removed by incubation with SM-2 bio-beads (Bio-Rad). Because not all of the labeled actin could participate in polymerization/depolymerization cycles, it was removed during repeated cycles of polymerization and depolymerization (37Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Severing assays were performed on the dialyzed cell lysates obtained from the migratory and nonmigratory samples by fluorescence spectrophotometry (excitation = 365 nm; emission = 386 nm; slit width = 3 nm). Cell lysates prepared with detergent as described above (Ref. 19Cunningham G.C. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Science. 1991; 251: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar plus protease inhibitors) were dialyzed with several changes of buffer containing 2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM Tris-HCl, and 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, with 1 mM NaN3. The volume of the dialyzed cell lysate was adjusted to 200 µl in dialysis buffer; 100 µl of labeled F-actin in polymerizing buffer (50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2) was added to a final concentration of 200 nM. Severing assay were performed in the presence of calcium (final concentration, 2 mM CaCl2/1 mM EGTA). In separate experiments designed to assess the in vitro motility block by electroinjected gelsolin (2C4) antibody, severing assays were performed. Increasing concentrations of antibody were titrated to assess the concentration of antibody that would block severing. Gelsolin (1 µM; purified as described in Ref. 34Kurokawa H. Wataru F.

Severing activity was also assessed with an irrelevant antibody (pan-cytokeratin; clone PCK-26; Sigma). Cells on polycarbonate filters were stained with mouse monoclonal antibodies against α-smooth muscle actin (1:50 dilution; clone 1A4; Ref. 38Skalli O. Ropraz P. Trzeciak A. Benzonana C. Gillessen D.

Filamentous (F)-actin in formaldehyde fixed cells was stained by tetra-methylrhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin at 5 × 10−6 M for 15 min (Sigma). Monomeric (G)-actin was stained with deoxyribonuclease I, tetra-methylrhodamine isothiocyanate conjugate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described (40Knowles G. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) after stabilizing the actin pools (10 mM Tris and 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.01% Triton X-100, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol for 1 min at 4°C. For staining of gelsolin the cells were fixed in PBS plus 3% formaldehyde, 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide for 15 min and then permeabilized in acetone for 6 min followed by antibody staining with a 3% BSA block. In separate experiments involving electroinjection of gelsolin antibody, cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody only. The spatial distribution and intensity of gelsolin staining was determined in single cells by confocal microscopy (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany; 63× oil immersion lens; N.A. 1.4). Transverse sections were obtained by optical sectioning at 1 µm nominal thickness. Laser intensity, pinhole, and photo multiplier tube gain were kept constant for all intensity measurements. In some figures in which cells were double-labeled for F-actin and gelsolin, the intensity of the printer brightness was adjusted so that adequate detailed could be discerned. Single cell suspensions were prepared for flow cytometry analysis by trypsinization of cells from the filters after the termination of the migration assay. Cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde with PBS and 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide for 15 min and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. To obtain accurate estimates of fluorescent intensity that were not confounded by inclusion of gelsolin-containing serum, cells were blocked with 3% BSA to avoid spurious introduction of gelsolin into the cells that is associated with a serum block. Cells were stained for gelsolin (2C4), washed, and resuspended in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS. Samples were analyzed on a FACSTAR Plus flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mississauga, ON) at 200 cells/s with 488 nm laser excitation. To optimize the method by which the anti-gelsolin antibody inhibits the intracellular activity of gelsolin, in vitro studies were performed first to determine the amount of antibody that would complex known amounts of gelsolin. From estimates of cell number and the amount of protein in the lysates, we determined the optimal concentration of purified gelsolin for experiments (1 µM; i.e. 83 µg/ml). Gelsolin was incubated with various dilutions of gelsolin antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-gelsolin antibody; 2C4; in electroporation buffer). The gelsolin-antibody complexes were removed with protein A-Sepharose. The residual, free gelsolin was detected by immunoblotting, and the optimal concentration of antibody for complete complexing was calculated (100 µg/ml). For electroporation and severing assays an equivalent molar amount of antibody was used. To directly assess the requirement for gelsolin in cell migration in the chemotactic assay, the gelsolin antibody or an irrelevant antibody (pan-cytokeratin antibody, clone PCK-26; diluted in electroporation buffer) was electroinjected into cells by electroporation as described (41Glogauer M. McCulloch C.A.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Electroporation was performed with a Bio-Rad gene pulser, a capacitance extender, and sterile cuvettes. An 800-µl aliquot of 2 × 106 cells/ml was placed into an electroporation cuvette (0.4-cm interelectrode distance), and the cells were electroporated in a buffer containing 5.37 mM KCl, 0.52 mM KH2PO4, 0.64 mM MgCl2, 0.63 mM MgSO4, 85.5 mM NaCl, 5.8 mM NaHCO3, 0.50 mM NaH2PO4, and 12.5 mM HEPES at a field strength of 250 V/cm and capacitance of 500 microfarads. The cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in growth medium without serum, and 5 × 104 cells/well were assayed in the Boyden chamber with a chemotactic gradient for various time periods. The filter-attached cells were fixed and stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole before counting. Previous detailed assessments of this protocol have demonstrated that 108 antibody molecules/cell can be introduced into viable cells (41Glogauer M. McCulloch C.A.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and that electroinjected antibodies can specifically bind and inactivate specific functional proteins (40Knowles G.

To examine the role of intracellular calcium fluxes in chemotactically induced cell migration, attached, serum-starved cells were loaded with fura2/acetoxymethyl ester (3 µM) and were stimulated with 20% FBS. [Ca2+]i was estimated as described (43Arora P.D. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In separate experiments, cells were co-loaded with fura2/AM and BAPTA/AM (3 µM) in calcium-free buffer, and the [Ca2+]i was determined as described. Cell viability was assessed by adding Ca2+ and 1 µM ionomycin. Total cellular RNA was prepared from the migratory and nonmigratory cells and quantified by UV spectroscopy. Prehybridization and hybridization were at 60°C, and washing precedures were at 55°C as described (44Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 545Google Scholar). Three different customized 27-mer oligonucleotide probes for gelsolin based on the published human gelsolin cDNA sequence (45Kwiatkowski D.J. Stossel T.P. Orkin S.H. Mole J.E. Colten H.R. Yin H.L. Nature. 1986; 323: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and one 29-mer oligo from the human β-actin cDNA sequence (46Davis T. Urdea M. Masiarz F. Cell. 1986; 47: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) were designed with the OLIGO program to minimize self-hybridization, synthesized (General Diagnostics Systems, Toronto, ON), and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Oligos were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (>3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) by T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (Pharmacia). The labeled probes were purified with NICK columns (Pharmacia), and 1 µl of labeled probe was used in the scintillation counter to determine the total 32P incorporation before hybridization. The blots were sequentially probed for gelsolin and actin as described (46Davis T. Urdea M. Masiarz F. Cell. 1986; 47: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). After hybridization, the blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at −70°C using intensifying screens. The radioactive bands were quantified by densitometry and normalized to the hybridization obtained for the β-actin. After the chemotactic assay was performed and cells had been separated on the filter membrane, the medium was replaced with serum-free and methionine-deficient medium containing 100 µCi/ml of [35S]methionine (specific activity, 1000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and solubilized with Triton-containing lysis buffer (6Howard T. Chaponnier C. Yin H."
https://openalex.org/W2044754041,"We have identified two regions of the mouse gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) promoter, one between −237 and −201 (distal element) and the other between −184 and −150 (proximal element), which are required for glucocorticoid repression in transiently transfected GT1-7 cells. These sequences show no similarity to known positive or negative glucocorticoid response elements (nGREs) and do not function when placed upstream of heterologous viral promoters. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) does not bind directly to the distal or proximal promoter elements but may participate in glucocorticoid repression of GnRH gene transcription by virtue of its association within multiprotein complexes at these nGREs.

One protein that co-occupies the distal nGRE in vitro along with GR is the POU domain transcription factor Oct-1. Thus, the tethering of GR to the GnRH distal nGRE, by virtue of a direct or indirect association with DNA-bound Oct-1, could play a role in hormone-dependent transcriptional repression of the GnRH gene.

GnRH is secreted from widely dispersed neurons along the rostral hypothalamus and basal forebrain into the pituitary portal vessels to control release of the gonadotropins. The sparsity and distribution of GnRH neurons have rendered difficult in vivo cellular and molecular studies aimed at elucidating the regulation of GnRH gene expression. However, such studies have become possible in vitro due to the development of immortalized, GnRH-secreting hypothalamic cell lines (GT1 cells) from a genetically engineered brain tumor in a transgenic mouse (1Mellon P.L. Windle J.J. Goldsmith P.C. Padula C.A. Roberts J.L. Weiner R.I. Neuron. 1990; 5: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). These cell lines (GT1-1, GT1-3, and GT1-7) have been used to examine the regulation of GnRH secretion and gene expression by a variety of neurotransmitters (2Martinez de la Escalera G. Gallo F.

One potential application of the GT1 cell lines, of particular interest to our laboratories, concerns the putative role of adrenal steroid hormones in regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Both stress-related reproductive disorders and high cortisol levels in women have been associated with reductions in GnRH and luteinizing hormone (12Suh B.Y. Liu J.H. Berga S.L. Quigley M.E.

Convey E.M. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 1782-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), results obtained in castrated male rhesus monkeys implicate an action at the hypothalamic level to inhibit GnRH synthesis and/or release (16Dubey A.K. Plant T.M. Biol. Reprod. 1985; 33: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Studies in immature female rats also support the notion that the effects of glucocorticoids on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis may be exerted at a hypothalamic site (17Brann D.W. Mahesh V.B. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 44: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, responses to glucocorticoid hormones are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein, a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone superfamily of nuclear receptors (18Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar, 19Green S. Chambon P. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 20Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2852) Google Scholar). Recently Ahima and Harlan (21Ahima R.S. Harlan R.E. Neuroendocrinology. 1992; 56: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a subset of GnRH neurons in the rat brain contain immunoreactive GR, raising the possibility that genomic effects of GR within these neurons could directly influence GnRH gene expression and secretion and thus the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Using GT1-3 and GT1-7 cells as model systems, we carried this analysis to the molecular level by demonstrating that these cells contain functional GR and that the potent glucocorticoid agonist, dexamethasone, inhibited the transcriptional activity of both the endogenous mouse GnRH gene and transfected reporter genes under the control of the rat GnRH promoter (7Chandran U.R. Attardi B. Friedman R. Dong K.-W. Roberts J.L. DeFranco D.B. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have mapped two negative glucocorticoid responsive elements (nGREs) within the mouse GnRH promoter and identified a novel mechanism for GR-mediated repression, which involves the tethering of GR to nGREs via an association with other DNA-bound transcription factors. DNA fragments containing mouse GnRH 5′-flanking sequences extending to the first exon, −3446 to +24 and −552 to +24, were subcloned into the promoterless luciferase vector pXP2 between BamHI and XhoI sites. A series of 5′-deletion fragments, between approximately 500 and 100 base pairs (bp) in length, were generated by mung bean nuclease/exonuclease III digestion and linked to pXP2 between BamHI and XhoI sites. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Maintenance of the appropriate transcription initiation sites in the 5′-deletion constructs was verified by reverse transcription and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (data not shown). GT1-7 cells were generously provided by Drs. Richard Weiner (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and Pamela Mellon (University of California, San Diego, CA). GT1-7 cells were grown in monolayer culture in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Formula 78-5470EF purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.) containing glucose (4.5 g/liter), NaHCO3 (2.2 g/liter), and Hepes (5.96 g/liter), and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfections, cells were plated in 6-cm Petri dishes at 1-3 × 106 cells/dish and used at 50-80% confluency (generally within 1 or 2 days). Approximately 2 h prior to transfection, the medium was withdrawn, and fresh medium (Eagle's minimum essential medium + 10% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum) was added. Cultures were maintained in medium containing 10% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped-stripped fetal bovine serum until harvesting. Transfections involved 32-54 dishes so that all experimental and control conditions could be compared in the same experiment. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate procedure using reagents from Life Technologies, Inc. as described previously (7Chandran U.R. Attardi B. Friedman R. Dong K.-W. Roberts J.L. DeFranco D.B. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1467-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Attardi B. Focus. 1991; 13: 84-87Google Scholar). For each plasmid to be transfected, a sufficient quantity of calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate was prepared so that the same precipitate could be dispensed to all control and hormone-treated dishes in triplicate. In this way, luciferase activity in control and experimental cultures could be compared directly without the need to correct for transfection efficiency with an additional reporter gene. After 4 h, cells were washed and incubated with fresh medium (control medium or medium containing 10−6 M dexamethasone (Steraloids, Wilton, NH) for 20 h unless otherwise indicated. Cell lysates were prepared in 25 mM Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM 1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′, N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and analyzed for protein content (23Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was determined in aliquots containing equivalent total protein (usually 40 µg) by the procedure of deWet et al. (24De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar) using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). For comparison of the basal transcriptional activity of the series of 5′-flanking deletion constructs, a cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid was co-transfected with the GnRH-luciferase plasmids. β-galactosidase activity was measured using the CPRG (chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside) substrate (25Eustice D.C. Feldman P.A. Colberg-Poley A.M. Buckery R.M. Neubauer R.H. Biotechnology. 1991; 11: 739-742Google Scholar), and luciferase activities were normalized for differences in transfection efficiency based on β-galactosidase activities. Transfections of each DNA construct were performed in triplicate. For comparison of different experiments, luciferase activities from dexamethasone-treated cultures were converted to a percentage of those of control cultures. Differences in dexamethasone suppressibility of the various 5′-deleted GnRH promoter constructs were tested by one-way analysis of variance followed by t test using the BMDP statistical software package (University of California Press, Berkeley, CA). The anti-GR antibody, BuGR2 (26Gametchu B. Harrison R.W. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. Robert Harrison (University of Rochester Medical School, Rochester, NY). The anti-chicken PR antibody, PR22 (27Sullivan W.P. Beito T.G. Proper J. Krco C.J. Toft D.O. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1549-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. David Toft (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). The antibody to Oct-1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biologicals (Santa Cruz, CA). Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modification of the rapid nuclear extraction protocol (28Roeder R.G. Lebovitz R.M. Dignam J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 80% confluence in 10-cm dishes and fed with fresh media. The next day, the cells were treated with 10−7 M dexamethasone for 6 h, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested in phosphate-buffered saline. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 400 µl of ice-cold Buffer A, which consists of 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM of the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 µg/ml of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. The cells were incubated on ice for 10 min and lysed by vigorous vortexing for 10 s, and a nuclear pellet obtained by centrifugation for 10 s at 4°C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of ice-cold Buffer C, which consists of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM DTT, and 1 µg/ml of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin. This mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min at 4°C. The extract was centrifuged for 2 min, and the supernatant aliquoted and stored at −80°C. For EMSAs (29Crothers D.M. Fried M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar) of GT1-7 nuclear extracts with radioactively labeled oligonucleotide probes, single-stranded oligonucleotides were 32P-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1982: 1Google Scholar). The single-stranded oligonucleotides were hybridized to their complementary strands to generate double-stranded probes. 0.05 µM of 32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated in 1 × gel shift buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50% glycerol, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT) and 1 µg/ml poly(dI-dC) in a 15-µl reaction volume with 5 µg of GT1-7 extract for 15 min at room temperature. To resolve protein-DNA complexes, the reaction mix was run on a 10% native polyacrylamide (75:1) gels (for probes L7 and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) GRE) or 5% native polyacrylamide (39:1) gels (for probe L75) in 1 × TBE. Gels were electrophoresed in 1 × TBE at 180 V for approximately 30 min. For competition assays, unlabeled double-stranded competitor DNA was incubated first with GT1-7 nuclear extract for 10 min, and then the radiolabeled probe was added. For supershift assays with the monoclonal GR antibody, 1 µl of ascites fluid containing the antibody was first incubated with the GT1-7 extract for 10 min at room temperature, after which the radiolabeled probe was added, and the incubation was continued for another 15 min. For supershift assays with the Oct-1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biologicals), probe and extract were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, subsequent to which the antibody was added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 30 min. For EMSAs of the MMTV GRE with purified, DNA-binding domain of rat GR (XGR556), 0.05 µM of 32P-end-labeled probe was incubated with 25 ng of XGR556 in 1 × binding buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM DTT) in a 15-µl reaction volume for 15 min at room temperature. One µg of poly(dI-dC) was included in the reaction to minimize nonspecific binding. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (75:1), and electrophoresis was carried out in 1 × TBE buffer at 180 V for 45 min. All double-stranded probes used in EMSAs were generated by hybridizing denatured single-stranded oligonucleotides.

The octamer-binding sequence, Oct-1, was derived from the MMTV LTR and is located between bp −56 and −37 (33Bruggemeier U. Kalff M. Franke S. Scheidereit C. Beato M. Cell. 1991; 64: 565-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It consists of the following sequence: 5′-AGCTTAGTCTTATGTAAATGCTTATGTAAAC-3′. Only the sequence of the top strands of the MMTV GRE, TAT GRE, and the Oct-1-binding sequence are shown. The complementary bottom strands were also synthesized, and two strands were hybridized to generate double-stranded probes. In order to localize sequence elements within the GnRH promoter that are responsible for GR-mediated transcriptional repression, dexamethasone effects were assessed on a series of plasmids containing 5′-flanking deletions of the GnRH promoter using the luciferase gene as a reporter. As shown in Table I, basal promoter activity was reduced 75-80% upon deletion of sequences between −3446 and −522 bp, suggesting removal of an enhancer element that has been demonstrated to reside within −1863 to −1571 bp of the rat promoter (34Whyte D.B. Lawson M.A. Belsham D.D. Eraly S.A. Bond C.T. Adelman J.P. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 467-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further deletion to −447 resulted in a drop of promoter activity to 6-7% of the −3446 construct. Basal activity of the smallest promoter fragment tested (−108 bp) was reduced more than 99% compared with the full-length promoter. These results are generally in agreement with those of Kepa et al. (35Kepa J.K. Wang C. Neeley C.I. Raynolds M.V. Gordon D.F. Wood W.M. Wierman M.E.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 shows the effect of dexamethasone on promoter activity of this series of GnRH-luciferase fusion genes (results of 4-29 experiments, each performed in triplicate). Dexamethasone treatment resulted in a 60-70% repression of luciferase activity of the −3446, −522, −447, and −250 promoter constructs. Glucocorticoid sensitivity of the mouse GnRH promoter decreased slightly between −237 and −216 bp but was lost mainly with deletion of the sequences from −216 to −201 bp and from −184 to −150 bp. Basal activity of the −108 base pair construct was too low to reliably measure the effect of dexamethasone. Thus, the mouse GnRH promoter possesses two nGREs that contribute to glucocorticoid-mediated transcriptional repression. The proximal nGRE is located between −184 and −150 while the distal nGRE is located between −237 and −201. Both nGREs, either separately or together, exhibit minimal activity when fused to heterologous promoters derived from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene or Rous sarcoma virus LTR (data not shown). Interestingly, an analogous region of the rat GnRH promoter (−126 to −22) appears to mediate repression by activators of protein kinase C such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (36Eraly S.A. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 848-859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the mouse and rat GnRH promoters utilize different start sites, the numbering of 5′-flanking sequences varies. Thus, sequences from −237 to −150 of the mouse promoter correspond to −132 to −45 of the rat promoter and are 95% identical (36Eraly S.A. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 848-859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relationship between 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and dexamethasone repression is currently unknown but will be the subject of future studies. The nGREs within the mouse GnRH promoter (Fig. 2) do not bear any homology to either positive GREs (18Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar) or any nGREs identified in other genes (37Drouin J. Sun Y.L. Chamberland M. Gauthier Y. DeLean A. Nemer M. Schmidt T.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 145-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 38Strömstedt P.-E. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlstedt-Duke J. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Although nGREs do not share extensive sequence homology, some possess at least one copy (sometimes degenerate) of a half-site found in positively acting GREs (i.e. 5′-TGTTCT-3′ or its palindromic complement 5′-AGAACA-3′). In some cases these half-sites are sufficient to direct the binding of GR (40Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar, 41Mordacq J.C. Linzer D.I. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). There is one 5/6 and one 4/6 match to this GRE half-site consensus within the proximal nGRE of the mouse GnRH promoter, and one 4/6 match within the distal nGRE (Fig. 2). Therefore, we examined whether glucocorticoid repression might be due to direct binding of GR to the GnRH nGREs. However, using both DNase I footprinting and EMSAs, we were unable to detect binding of the purified DNA-binding domain of GR (XGR556) to GnRH nGREs (data not shown). To confirm the lack of GR binding to GnRH nGREs, we also performed competition analysis to determine whether the GnRH nGREs could compete with a radiolabeled GRE derived from the MMTV LTR for binding to XGR556. Up to a 1000-fold excess of either unlabeled MMTV GRE (Fig. 3, lanes 3-5) or the GnRH distal (Fig. 3, lanes 6-8) and proximal nGREs (Fig. 3, lanes 9-11) were used as competitors in this assay. As expected, unlabeled MMTV GRE was able to compete with the radiolabeled MMTV GRE probe for binding to XGR556, whereas the GnRH nGREs were not able to compete for binding of XGR556 to this probe even when present in 1000-fold molar excess. Thus, the GnRH nGREs do not bind the purified DNA-binding domain of GR with any appreciable affinity in vitro. While many examples of GR-mediated repression of transcription have emerged, no unifying mechanism is evident. In general, GR is capable of mediating transcriptional repression either via its direct interaction with DNA elements (37Drouin J. Sun Y.L. Chamberland M. Gauthier Y. DeLean A. Nemer M. Schmidt T.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 145-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) or through protein-protein interactions that functionally inactivate specific transcription factors (42Yang-Yen H.-F. Chambard J.-C. Sun Y.-L. Smeal T. Schmidt T.J. Drouin J. Karin M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1205-1215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar, 43Schüle R. Rangarajam P. Kleiwer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Yang N. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Since GR did not appear to bind the GnRH nGREs in vitro, we used EMSAs to examine whether proteins in GT1-7 nuclear extracts bind to the mouse GnRH nGREs. Nuclear extracts were prepared from GT1-7 cells and incubated with radiolabeled L7 or L75 oligonucleotide probes representing sequences between −237 to −201 (distal nGRE) and −184 to −150 bp (proximal nGRE), respectively, of the mouse GnRH promoter. The formation of protein-DNA complexes was monitored by EMSAs. Eraly et al. (36Eraly S.A. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 848-859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown by in vitro DNase I footprinting experiments that GT1-7 nuclear proteins form complexes with the promoter proximal region of the rat GnRH promoter, a region that is 95% homologous to mouse promoter proximal sequence. Incubation of GT1-7 nuclear extract with the L7 probe resulted in the formation of several protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 4A, lane 2). All of these complexes represent proteins bound specifically to the L7 oligonucleotide, since their formation can be competed by excess unlabeled L7 oligonucleotide (Fig. 4A, lane 3). When unlabeled oligonucleotides spanning different regions of the −237 to −201 sequence were tested for their ability to compete with the L7 probe for binding to GT1-7 nuclear extract, L71 and L72, which represent base pairs −237 to −218 and −222 to −210, respectively, did not compete for formation of any of the complexes. (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 5, respectively). Only L73, which represents bp −218 to −201, competed effectively for formation of complex C1 and C6 (Fig. 4A, lane 6), suggesting that the proteins present in these complexes bind to the −218 to −201 bp region of the L7 probe. Since complexes C2-C5 were competed only by L7 and not by L71, L72, or L73, these complexes must form only when the entire −237 to −201 bp sequence is present. Therefore, they either represent degradation products of protein complexes that bind tightly only when the entire −237 to −201 bp region is present, or their binding sequence is not completely included within the truncated L71, L72, or L73 oligonucleotides. It is not clear why some complexes such as C4 and C5 increase in intensity in the presence of oligonucleotides L71, L72, and L73. Perhaps factors present in crude nuclear extracts that destabilize these complexes are competed by various oligonucleotides. That only L73 is able to compete effectively for formation of complexes suggests that the −218 to −201 bp region binds GT1-7 nuclear proteins stably. This result is consistent with the promoter deletion analysis, which implicates this region as important for dexamethasone mediated repression of the mouse GnRH gene. None of the complexes was competed by the TAT3 oligonucleotide (Fig. 4A, lane 7), which contains the GRE sequence from the TAT promoter (32Jantzen H.-M. Strähle U. Gloss B. Stewart F. Schmidt W. Boshart M. Miksicek R. Schütz G. Cell. 1987; 49: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), ruling out the possibility that endogenous GR in GT1-7 extracts binds directly to the L7 probe. The number of complexes formed between the L7 oligonucleotide and GT1-7 nuclear proteins varies with different batches of extract. For example, a nonspecific complex (NS) (Fig. 4B, lane 2) that is not effectively competed by excess unlabeled L7 or L73 oligonucleotide (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4) is sometimes observed. In addition, complexes C2-C6 are not always resolved in the EMSAs (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3). To determine if any new complexes are induced by dexamethasone treatment of cells, we performed the EMSA with GT1-7 extracts from both dexamethasone-treated and untreated cells. We were unable to detect novel dexamethasone-induced complexes (data not shown). When the L75 oligonucleotide (−184 to −150 bp, proximal nGRE) was used as the labeled probe in EMSAs with GT1-7 nuclear extracts, a number of complexes were formed (Fig. 5, lane 2) whose formation could be competed for with unlabeled L75 oligonucleotides (Fig. 5, lane 3). These EMSAs with the L7 and the L75 probes suggest that GT1-7 nuclear extracts contain proteins that are ca"

In this study, we localized the β-binding domain of α to a carboxyl-terminal region by quantifying the interaction of β with a series of α deletion proteins. Purification and binding analysis was facilitated by insertion of hexahistidine and short biotinylation sequences on the deletion terminus of α. Interaction of β with α deletion proteins was studied by gel filtration and surface plasmon resonance. α lacking 169 COOH-terminal residues still possessed β-binding activity; whereas deletion of 342 amino acids from the COOH terminus abolished β binding. Deletion of 542 amino acids from the NH2 terminus of the 1160 residue α subunit resulted in a protein that bound β 10-20-fold more strongly than native α. Hence, portions of α between residues 542 and 991 are involved in β binding. DNA binding to α apparently triggers an increased affinity for β (Naktinis, V., Turner, J., and O'Donnell, M.

Our findings extend this observation by implicating the amino-terminal polymerase domain in inducing a low affinity taut conformation in the carboxyl-terminal β-binding domain.

The β subunit was prepared as described by Johanson et al. (1986), and the τ subunit was purified as described by Dallmann et al. (1995). Streptavidin was purchased from Pierce. CM5 sensor chip (research grade), N-hydroxysuccinimide, 1-ethyl-3-[(3-dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide, ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.0) and P-20 surfactant were purchased from Pharmacia Biosensor. Centricon-30 microconcentrators were obtained from Amicon. Poly(dA) and oligo(dT)16 were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. DE81 ion exchange papers (2.5 cm diameter) were from Whatman. Buffer TSG is 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol. Buffer TS is 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.005% P-20 surfactant. A 24-ml Superose 12 FPLC gel filtration column (Pharmacia Biotech) was used to study the interaction of α and β as described (Stukenberg et al., 1991). β2 (510 pmol), α (224 pmol), α-β (224 pmol α and 510 pmol β2), αNΔ1 (277 pmol), αNΔ1-β (277 pmol αNΔ1 and 510 pmol β2), αNΔ542 (300 pmol), αNΔ542-β (300 pmol αNΔ542 and 510 pmol β2), αCΔ0 (150 pmol), αCΔ0-β (200 pmol αCΔ0 and 510 pmol β2), αCΔ48 (150 pmol), αCΔ48-β (300 pmol αCΔ48 and 510 pmol β2), αCΔ169 (200 pmol), αCΔ169-β (275 pmol αCΔ169 and 510 pmol β2), αCΔ342 (200 pmol), and αCΔ342-β (270 pmol αCΔ342 and 510 pmol β2) in 200 µl of buffer TSG were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and injected individually onto the column at 4°C. 70 fractions (200 µl each) were collected at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. αCΔ0, αCΔ48, αCΔ169, and αCΔ342 were concentrated in a Centricon-30 microconcentrator at 5,000 × g at 0°C for 30 min before use. Superose 12 column fractions (70 µl) were loaded onto a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (1.5 × 18 × 16 cm) prepared according to Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and separated at 70 V overnight. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue overnight and destained in a solution of 10% methanol and 10% acetic acid. To estimate the affinities of the interaction between β and the α deletion proteins using gel filtration analysis, stained gels of the column fractions were subjected to a laser densitometric scan (Molecular Dynamics). This interaction was modeled as a simple 1:1 interaction between an α monomer and a β dimer (α+β⇄αβ), where the dissociation constant for this reaction is defined as KD = [αf][βf]/[αβ]. The molar concentration of bound α monomer (αβ) was determined from the equation: αβ = (Iαβ/IαT)αT, where αT is the total molar concentration of α loaded onto the column, IαT is the total intensity from all the α bands (bound and unbound), and Iαβ is the total intensity of bands corresponding to α bound with β. The fractions containing β bound to α were determined by comparing the shift in the elution position of β in the presence and absence of α. The amounts of free β dimer (βf) and free α monomer (αf) were then determined from mass conservation; βf = βT−αβ (βT is the total initial molar concentration of β) and αf = αT−αβ. Since significant dilution occurs during gel filtration, so that the eluted protein concentration is not equal to the protein concentration loaded onto the column, the KD was also calculated with a correction factor derived from the ratio of the total elution volume of α (generally, 1 ml) to the injection volume (0.2 ml) that yields a 5-fold dilution. Thus, KD was calculated assuming a 5-fold lower αT and βT concentrations than the actual initial molar input concentrations. The corrected and uncorrected KD values represent upper and lower limits, respectively, providing a comparison of the relative affinity between β and the α deletion proteins since all filtration analyses were done under the same conditions. A BIAcore™ instrument (Pharmacia Biosensor) was also used to study α-β interaction. Streptavidin was chemically coupled to the chip using a coupling reaction of N-hydroxysuccinimide and 1-ethyl-3-[(3-dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide, followed by ethanolamine inactivation as described (Kim and McHenry, 1996), and αNΔ1 (10 µl, 66 µg/ml) or αNΔ542 (20 µl, 100 µg/ml) was immobilized by interaction with streptavidin in buffer TS, resulting in immobilization of 3300 RUs (αNΔ1) and 3500 RUs (αNΔ542). The interaction between α and β was measured by varying β concentration (0.1-1 µM as dimer) at a flow rate of 2 µl/min at 20°C in buffer TS. Kinetic parameters were determined using BIAevaluation 2.1 software. To further examine the interaction between β and α deletion proteins (αCΔ0, αCΔ48, αCΔ169, and αCΔ342), β stimulation of DNA synthesis by α deletion proteins on poly(dA)-oligo(dT) primer-templates was measured by the method of LaDuca et al. (1986). Homopolymeric templates were prepared by annealing poly(dA) and oligo(dT)16 at a 19:1 ratio (as nucleotide) at 37°C for 5 min in 0.1 mM EDTA and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Reaction mixtures (50 µl) containing 50 µM poly(dA)-oligo(dT) primer-templates (as nucleotide), 25 fmol of α or α deletion protein, 50 µM [3H]dTTP (400 cpm/pmol), 10 mM MgCl2 in the presence of varying amounts of the β subunit (0-80 × 103 units) in enzyme dilution buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 200 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, and 10 mM dithiothreitol) were incubated at 30°C for 5 min and terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 100 mM. Samples were filtered onto DE81, washed, and bound radioactivity determined as described (LaDuca et al., 1986). We previously reported the construction of a series of plasmids that contain progressive deletions from the termini of α (Kim and McHenry, 1996). The terminus of the deletion-containing α subunit was fused to a peptide containing a hexahistidine sequence and a short sequence that is biotinylated in vivo, facilitating purification and immobilization (Kim and McHenry, 1996). We analyzed the ability of these deleted α subunits to interact with β2 using a gel filtration method initially developed by Stukenberg et al. (1991) to demonstrate an α-β interaction. As a positive control, the interaction of wild-type α and β was tested. β2 alone eluted mainly at fractions 61-63 (Fig. 1A), and α eluted at fractions 57-60 (Fig. 1B). When β was incubated with α prior to gel filtration, its elution position shifted to a higher molecular weight (fractions 56-58, Fig. 1C), indicating an interaction. The densitometric scan of this gel permitted estimation of an α-β KD between 0.2 and 1 µM, consistent with the value 250 nM determined by Stukenberg et al. (26Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). αNΔ1 (missing the first amino acid and fused to a peptide) showed nearly the same interaction as wild-type α (Fig. 1, D and E, Table I), suggesting that the fusion peptide itself did not perturb β binding. The α deletion protein αNΔ542, which has a 542-amino acid deletion from the NH2 terminus, bound β about 20-fold more strongly than full-length α (Fig. 1, compare C with G) (Table I). Formation of partially unfolded proteins that aggregated precluded examination of deletions greater than 542 residues (Kim and McHenry, 1996). These results showed that the β-binding site was located in the COOH-terminal half of the α subunit.TABLE I.Relative affinity of the interaction of α deletion proteins and β as determined by Superose 12 gel filtrationProteinsKDaThe concentration of β as dimer was used in all cases.µMα-β0.20-1.0αNΔ1-β0.10-0.6αNΔ542-β0.01-0.05αCΔ0-β0.40-2.0αCΔ48-β2.00-13.0αCΔ169-β5.00-29.0a The concentration of β as dimer was used in all cases. Open table in a new tab To determine the COOH-terminal limit of α for β binding, we tested the β-binding activities of COOH-terminal deletion proteins. The full-length COOH-terminal α fusion protein (αCΔ0) showed very similar β-binding activity to that of wild-type α (Table I). β was shifted to the elution position of αCΔ0 due to their interaction (compare Fig. 1A with 2A and B). Both αCΔ48 and αCΔ169 bound β (Fig. 2, C-F), although binding was 12- and 30-fold weaker than that of wild-type α, respectively (Table I). Deletion of 342 amino acids from the COOH terminus resulted in a protein (αCΔ342) that did not bind β (Fig. 2, G and H). Thus, residues 542-991 define the approximate terminal limits of an α domain involved in interaction with β. Gel filtration analysis suggested that αNΔ542 bound β2 significantly more strongly than full-length α. To verify this observation, we examined the interaction of αNΔ542 with β by surface plasmon resonance. Biotinylated α deletion proteins αNΔ1 and αNΔ542 were immobilized on a sensor chip via streptavidin interaction as described (Kim and McHenry, 1996). When α derivatives were coupled at levels less than 1000 RU, the signal due to α-β binding was so small that it could not be reliably analyzed. Therefore, α deletion proteins were immobilized at a high level (3500 RU for αNΔ542 and 3300 RU for αNΔ1). Under these conditions, β bound and dissociated rapidly from αNΔ1 and αNΔ542 (Fig. 3, A and B). Even at high β concentrations (1 µM), binding was substoichiometric (0.08 β2/αNΔ1 and 0.2 β2/αNΔ542). The on-rate (kon) and off-rate (koff) of the interaction between αNΔ1 and β were 5.1 × 105 s−1 M−1 and 7.5 × 10−2 s−1, respectively, resulting in a KD of ∼150 nM (KD = koff/kon). αNΔ542 bound β with a KD of ∼40 nM (kon = 9.5 × 105 s−1 M−1; koff = 3.6 × 10−2 s−1). Both KD values were in the range determined by gel filtration analysis. The interaction of αNΔ1-β was weaker than that of αNΔ542-β, consistent with results from gel filtration analysis, even though there was only a 3.7-fold difference in the KD by BIAcore analysis compared to a 20-fold difference in the KD by gel filtration. Both τ and β bind to the COOH-terminal region of α (Kim and McHenry, 1996), raising the possibility of steric exclusion by virtue of overlapping binding sites of τ and β. To test this possibility, we performed gel filtration experiments in which αNΔ1 and τ (4-fold molar excess) were incubated followed by addition of β. As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), β was detected in early column fractions indicating an α-τ-β complex and thus the absence of significant competition between τ and β. Moreover, the binding of τ to α is much tighter than that of β2 (70 pM versus ∼0.2-1 µM, respectively), and would have prevented β2 binding if binding were competitive. τ binding to αNΔ1 appeared to induce a slight decrease in the affinity between β and αNΔ1, as indicated by a comparison to the gel filtration results with β-αNΔ1 alone (Fig. 1E); indeed, densitometric scans of Fig. 1E and 4B showed that approximately 4-fold less β bound to αNΔ1 in the presence of τ. When αNΔ542 was used for gel filtration with τ and β, β was also observed to interact with this COOH-terminal domain of α in the presence of excess τ (Fig. 4C). We were unable to compare the affinity of the αNΔ542-β interaction in the presence and absence of τ due to the similar molecular mass of τ and αNΔ542 and their co-migration on polyacrylamide gels, although the level of β bound in the presence of τ (Fig. 4C) appears to be less than that observed in the absence of τ (Fig. 1G). We also used surface plasmon resonance to determine whether τ affects the α-β interaction as indicated by gel filtration analysis. Streptavidin was immobilized as described (Kim and McHenry, 1996), followed by sequential injections of αNΔ542, β (1), τ (1), β (2), τ (2), and β (3) over the streptavidin chip to examine the effect of τ on αNΔ542-β binding (sensorgram 1 of Fig. 5). The interaction of αNΔ542 and streptavidin resulted in immobilization of about 5000 RU. The injection of τ (1) over αNΔ542 showed binding saturation since a second injection, τ (2), did not lead to additional τ binding (sensorgram 1 of Fig. 5). In the absence of τ, αNΔ542 bound β (about 600 RU) with a KD of ∼80 nM (kon = 6.3 × 105 (s−1 M−1); koff = 4.8 × 10−2 (s−1)). αNΔ542-τ complex also bound β (about 350 RU), with a slightly diminished KD of ∼200 nM (kon = 5.6 × 105 (s−1 M−1); koff = 0.1 (s−1)), as determined from two β injections [β (2) and β (3)]. Data were analyzed after subtraction of sensorgram 2 from sensorgram 1 (Fig. 5), which represents β binding to the αNΔ542-τ complex without the background of τ dissociating from αNΔ542. Hence, the interaction of αNΔ542-β was 2-fold stronger before τ injection than after τ injection, as indicated by the KD values calculated from a single sensorgram and the mass amount of β bound to αNΔ542. We detected interactions between β and α deletion proteins αCΔ0, αCΔ48 and αCΔ169, but no interaction between β and αCΔ342 using gel filtration analysis. DNA synthetic activity of pol III was reportedly stimulated 7-fold by the addition of a stoichiometric excess of β on poly(dA)-oligo(dT) primer-templates (LaDuca et al., 1986). Here we examined β stimulation of α deletion proteins capable of synthesizing DNA using homopolymeric templates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The synthetic activities of three α deletion proteins αCΔ0, αCΔ48 and αCΔ169 and wild-type α were stimulated about 3-fold in the presence of 10,000-40,000 units (0.4-1.6 × 103 molar excess) of β (Fig. 6). The β subunit did not stimulate αCΔ342 activity even in the presence of the same gap-filling units of αCΔ342 as αCΔ169. Thus, the maintenance of β binding activity in polymerase-proficient α deletion proteins is adequate to permit β stimulation of polymerization. The rapid and processive DNA synthesis by holoenzyme depends on the β sliding clamp (Fay et al., 4Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5692-5699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DnaX complexes assemble β on DNA in a reaction that is coupled to ATP hydrolysis (Wickner, 30Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar; Onrust et al., 21Onrust R. Stukenberg P.T. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21681-21686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β sliding clamp confers high processivity by tethering polymerase to the DNA template (LaDuca et al., 12LaDuca R.J. Crute J.J. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7550-7557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Stukenberg et al., 26Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified the β-binding site of α by measuring the binding of β to modified α subunits that contain a deletion from either their NH2 or COOH terminus. The results indicate that a region between amino acid residues 542 and 991 of α is involved in β binding. Interestingly, deletion of 542 amino acids from the NH2 terminus of α resulted in a 4-20-fold higher affinity for β compared to wild-type α. This suggests that the amino-terminal domain of α, which contains the polymerase active site,2 is an inhibitory domain for the binding of β. Recently, O'Donnell and colleagues (Naktinis et al., 19Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) proposed a model in which DNA occupancy of the polymerase active site converts α to a form that has an increased affinity for β. Presumably, the modulation of this interaction is important in permitting rapid cycling of the lagging strand polymerase after completion of synthesis of an Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand. Our results are consistent with this proposal and add to our understanding of the mechanism. The unoccupied NH2-terminal polymerase domain must constrain the carboxyl-terminal β binding domain to a taut low affinity conformation, since its removal permits the high α affinity COOH-terminal domain to relax to a high β affinity conformer (Fig. 7A). Extending this observation to the model in which DNA modulates the binding of β by α, DNA occupancy of the polymerase site would alter its conformation so that the constraint on the COOH-terminal α domain is removed, permitting it to revert to a relaxed conformation with higher affinity for β (Fig. 7B). Upon completion of Okazaki fragment synthesis, and provided the affinity of the polymerase at a nick results in a lower DNA-polymerase affinity (a feature of the model that has not been verified quantitatively), dissociation of the polymerase from DNA would result in a lower affinity for β, permitting polymerase cycling. This model may be oversimplified since β presumably functions by tethering the polymerase to DNA, so that if the polymerase transiently dissociates during elongation, it would rapidly rebind. Such a mechanism would not be tenable if DNA dissociation automatically caused a break in the α-β link. Answers to these questions may rest in the relative rates of polymerase reassociation with a primer terminus versus β dissociation. A mechanism in which the conformational state of the polymerase influences complex stability may have other implications, including destabilization of elongating complexes to permit protein exchange during translesion synthesis in SOS mutagenesis. Both τ and β bind to the carboxyl-terminal domain of α (Kim and McHenry, 1996; present study). However, the τ binding domain appears to be larger and more complex. Like β binding, τ binding is abolished by deletions beyond residue 542 from the amino terminus. However, τ binding is also abolished by small deletions (48 residues) from the carboxyl terminus, whereas deletions of up to 169 amino acids from the COOH terminus are tolerated without loss of β binding (Fig. 7C). The mapping in Fig. 7C is approximate and only defines the terminal sequences involved in forming a stable domain that permits protein-protein interaction. The actual number of amino acids within these domains involved in the interactions is probably much smaller. Present models for holoenzyme function assume simultaneous τ and β binding during elongation. In fact, the γ subunit that is linked to τ in holoenzyme (Dallmann and McHenry, 2Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29563-29569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar; Onrust et al., 1995b23Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M.

Wood S. McHenry C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5606-5613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We find that β binds to both free α and α-τ with approximately the same affinity, although the affinity for β may be slightly diminished by the presence of τ. The close proximity of τ and β may permit modulation of the α-β interaction by other mechanisms that are sensitive to the state of the primosome, a component that is linked to the holoenzyme via a τ-DnaB interaction (Kim et al., 1996a8Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84 (a): 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). DnaB serves a dual role as the cellular helicase that separates two parental strands at the replication fork (LeBowitz and McMacken, 14LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and as a mobile promoter that interacts with the DnaG primase, permitting synthesis of the primer for the next Okazaki fragment at the fork (McMacken et al., 18McMacken R. Ueda K. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4190-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar; Tongu et al., 27Tongu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These contacts may enable a mechanism whereby synthesis of a new primer is communicated to the lagging strand polymerase, perhaps further destabilizing it for cycling to the new primer. Interestingly, τ also functions to protect β on elongating polymerases, preventing its premature removal by γ complex (Kim et al., 1996b9Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (b): 4315-4318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The conformational state of τ could influence this property. Proof of these hypotheses awaits precise identification of the interaction domains of the replisome subunits and analysis of the strength and functional consequences of altered conformational states."
https://openalex.org/W2038877370,"Abstract It has been recently recognized that the class III anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase requires the presence of a second activating gene product, NrdG. We have proposed that the role for NrdG involves the generation of an oxygen sensitive glycyl free radical within the NrdD enzyme. In this article we present the generation of such a glycyl free radical within the T4 NrdD subunit and its dependence upon the phage NrdG subunit. Initially, an overexpression system was created that allowed the joint production of T4 NrdD and T4 NrdG. With this system and in the presence of T4 NrdG, an oxygen-sensitive cleavage of NrdD was observed that mimicked the cleavage observed in phage infected Escherichia coli extracts. Under anaerobic conditions the presence of T4 NrdD with NrdG revealed a strong doublet EPR signal (g = 2.0039). Isotope labeling of the NrdD with [2H]glycine and [13C]glycine, respectively, confirmed the presence of a stabilized glycine radical. The unpaired electron is strongly coupled to C-2 in glycine and the doublet splitting originates from one of the α-protons. The glycine residue at position 580 was determined to be the radical containing residue through site-directed mutagenesis studies involving a G580A NrdD mutant. The glycyl radical generation was specific for the T4 NrdG, and the host E. coli NrdG was found to be unable to activate the phage reductase. Finally, anaerobic purification revealed the holoenzyme complex to contain iron, whereas the NrdD polypeptide was found to lack the metal. Our results suggest a tetrameric structure for the T4 anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase containing one homodimer each of NrdD and NrdG, with a single glycyl radical present."

Accordingly, the locomotive ability of these cells, as well as the stimuli (e.g. IL-8 1The abbreviations used are: IL-8interleukin-8IL-8RA and IL-8RBIL-8 receptors A and B, respectivelyGro-αmelanocyte growth-stimulatory activityNAP-2neutrophil-activating peptide-2G-proteinguanine nucleotide-binding proteinHBSSHanks' balanced salt solution. and related chemokines) that affect this ability, are critical elements of their functional responsiveness. interleukin-8 IL-8 receptors A and B, respectively melanocyte growth-stimulatory activity neutrophil-activating peptide-2 guanine nucleotide-binding protein Hanks' balanced salt solution. IL-8 belongs to a family of small proteins of 8-10 kDa that exhibit chemotactic activity toward various leukocyte subsets (1Hebert C.A. Baker J.B. Cancer Invest. 1993; 11: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 2Strieter R.M. Koch A.E. Antony V.B. Fick R.B. Standiford T.J. Kunkel S.L. J. Lab. Clin.

Alignment of the cysteine residues distinguishes between two groups of peptides within this family: one with the first two cysteines separated by one amino acid (CXC chemokines), and the other with the first two cysteines adjacent (CC chemokines). IL-8, NAP-2, and Gro gene products (Gro-α, Gro-β, Gro-α) belong to the first group (4Geiser T. Dewald B. Ehrengruber M.U. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. J. Biol.

In vitro, these chemokines appear to activate neutrophils in a highly selective manner (1Hebert C.A. Baker J.B. Cancer Invest. 1993; 11: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 2Strieter R.M. Koch A.E. Antony V.B. Fick R.B. Standiford T.J. Kunkel S.L. J. Lab. Clin.

Two specific IL-8 receptors have been identified on the surface of human neutrophils: IL-8RA and IL-8RB. IL-8RB binds IL-8, NAP-2, and Gro-α with high affinity, whereas IL-8RA shows high affinity for IL-8 but only low affinity for NAP-2 and Gro-α (6Petersen F. Flad H.D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2467-2478PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lee J. Horuk R. Rice G.C. Bennett G.L. Camerato T. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16283-16287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences encoded by the cDNA clones of IL-8 receptors show that they belong to the superfamily of G-protein-linked receptors (8Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.-J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 9Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 10Barnett M.L. Lamb K.A.

Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Consistent with the last observation, a physical association between the IL-8 receptors and the α2-subunit of Gi has recently been observed in human neutrophils and in 293 cells transfected with IL-8RA or IL-8RB receptors (12Damaj B.B. McColl S.R. Mahana W.N. Crouch M.F. Naccache P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12783-12789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a functional linkage between IL-8R and phospholipase C has been observed upon the co-transfection of the receptors and the α-subunit of Gq-like G proteins (11Wu D.Q. Larosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), and most, if not all, IL-8-induced neutrophil responses are sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin (13Kelvin D.J. Michiel D.F. Johnston J.A. Lloyd A.R. Sprenger H. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It has generally been assumed that neutrophils respond similarly to all CXC chemokines and that the two types of IL-8 receptors are functionally interchangeable. The adequacy of this model has, however, recently been challenged. More specifically, IL-8 stimulates the activity of phospholipase D, under-agarose chemotaxis, and the up-regulation of CD11b/CD18 to a significantly greater extent than either Gro-α or NAP-2 (14L'Heureux G. Bourgoin S. Jean N. McColl S.R. Naccache P.H. Blood. 1994; 85: 522-531Crossref Google Scholar). The biochemical basis for the differences in neutrophil responses to IL-8 versus Gro-α and NAP-2 is not yet known. While co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that the divergence in the signal transduction pathways apparently lies downstream from the initial interaction between IL-8R and the α-subunit of Gi (12Damaj B.B. McColl S.R. Mahana W.N. Crouch M.F. Naccache P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12783-12789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), further studies are required to identify the points at which the divergence occurs. The present study was therefore initiated to further examine the signal transduction pathways elicited through the two IL-8 receptor types by taking advantage of the availability of 293 cells transfected with IL-8RA or IL-8RB and comparing the ability of IL-8 and Gro-α to stimulate an influx of calcium in neutrophils and transfected 293 cells. The results obtained indicate not only that neutrophils respond differently to IL-8 as opposed to Gro-α but, furthermore, that they possess the ability to differentiate between IL-8 and Gro-α interacting with IL-8RB. Indo-1/AM and Fura-2/AM were obtained from Molecular Probes (Junction City, OR). Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), RPMI, penicillin, streptomycin, Geneticin, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.. All other reagents were from Sigma. SK&F 96365 was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Blood was collected from healthy adult volunteers into tubes containing heparin. After 2% dextran sedimentation, neutrophils were purified under sterile conditions by centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque cushions. Residual erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis, and the cells were resuspended in HBSS containing 1.6 mM CaCl2, unless indicated otherwise, at a final concentration of 15 × 106 cells/ml. The entire procedure was carried out at room temperature. The human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in polystyrene tissue culture flasks containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. The preparation of the stable IL-8RA and IL-8RB transfectants has been described in detail previously (15Hébert C.A. Chuntharapai A. Smith M. Colby T. Kim J. Horuk R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18549-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in the same culture conditions as parental cell lines except for the addition of 800 µg/ml of Geneticin. Intracellular free calcium was measured using the fluorescent probes Indo-1 or Fura-2 as described previously (16Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17Faucher N. Naccache P.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 132: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cell suspensions (107 cells/ml) were loaded with Indo-1/AM or Fura-2/AM (1 µM, 30 min at 37°C), washed, and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in HBSS supplemented with 0.5 or 1.6 mM calcium as indicated, and their fluorescence was monitored in a spectrofluorometer (SLM 8000, SLM-Aminco, Champagne, IL) (excitation and emission wavelengths, 350 and 405 nm for Indo-1 and 340 and 510 for Fura-2, respectively). The internal calcium concentrations were calculated as described in Tsien et al. (18Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Rink T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 3325-3334Crossref Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Each run was individually calibrated. The integrated areas under the calcium mobilization curves were computed using the FigP program (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Manganese influx was measured using the fluorescent probes Fura-2/AM or Indo-1/AM as described previously (19Merritt J.E. Jacob R. Hallam T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1522-1527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell suspensions (107 cells/ml) were loaded with Fura-2/AM (1 µM) (neutrophils) or Indo-1/AM (1 µM) (293 cells) for 30 min at 37°C, washed, and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in HBSS without calcium. MnCl2 (100 µM) was added 1 min before stimulation of the cells. The fluorescence of the cells was monitored in an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer (SLM-Aminco) (excitation and emission wavelengths, 360 and 505 nm for Fura-2, and 350 and 455 nm for Indo-1). The addition of IL-8 or Gro-α to a suspension of human neutrophils induced a transient increase in the concentration of cytoplasmic free calcium (Fig. 1A). While the kinetics of the initial rise in cytoplasmic free calcium initiated by IL-8 and Gro-α are essentially identical, the calcium signal induced by Gro-α was consistently observed to be longer lasting than that induced by IL-8. This is evidenced in Fig. 1B, in which the signals observed in response to the agonists were normalized to the same peak heights, by the presence of a delayed shoulder in the Gro-α response, which is absent in cells stimulated by IL-8. No significant qualitative or quantitative differences were seen in the calcium signals induced by IL-8 at concentrations ranging from 10−7 to 10−5 M or by IL-8 added first or after the Gro-α signal had returned to base line, i.e. at a time when most, if not all, IL-8RB was still occupied by Gro-α (as evidenced by a lack of response to a second addition of Gro-α (data not shown)). The contribution of extracellular calcium to the increase in cytoplasmic free calcium induced by IL-8 and Gro-α was then evaluated by adding the calcium chelator EGTA to the cell suspensions 30 s before stimulating the cells with IL-8 or Gro-α. Under these conditions, little, if any, extracellular calcium is available to diffuse into the cells, and the changes in fluorescence of Fura-2 that are recorded can be assumed to be almost exclusively due to calcium released from internal stores (20Molski T.F.P. Naccache P.H. Sha'afi R.I. Cell Calcium. 1983; 4: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig. 2. The tracings illustrated in panels A and B demonstrate that while the addition of EGTA had little to no effect on the response to IL-8, it significantly reduced that to Gro-α. The analysis of three such independent experiments indicated that EGTA reduced by 55% the increase in the intracellular levels of calcium induced by Gro-α, whereas it had no detectable inhibitory effect on the responses to IL-8 (Fig. 2C). It was also observed, in control experiments, that the tyrosine phosphorylation responses to IL-8 and to Gro-α were unaffected by EGTA, thereby indicating that the latter did not grossly interfere with the binding of the chemokines (data not shown). The effect of a selective inhibitor of receptor-mediated calcium entry, SK&F 96365, on the mobilization of calcium induced by IL-8 and Gro-α was examined next. The cells were preincubated with 25 µM SK&F 96365 for 5 min and then stimulated by 10−7 M IL-8 or Gro-α (Fig. 3). Representative tracings are shown in panels A and B, and a statistical analysis of the results of the three experiments is shown in panel C. SK&F 96365 reduced to a small but not significant (p > 0.05) extent the magnitude of the mobilization of calcium induced by IL-8. On the other hand, SK&F 96365 had a pronounced effect on the response to Gro-α (60 ± 5% inhibition, p < 0.05). The differences in the shape of the calcium mobilization curves induced by IL-8 and Gro-α and in the effects of EGTA and SK&F 96365 on these responses suggest that the two chemokines do not affect similarly the permeability to calcium of the plasma membrane of neutrophils. This parameter can be monitored more directly at the isosbestic point of Fura-2 by following the quenching of the fluorescent probe resulting from the influx of extracellularly added manganese (19Merritt J.E. Jacob R. Hallam T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1522-1527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of IL-8 and of Gro-α on Mn2+ influx in neutrophils (as monitored by the rate quenching of Fura-2) were therefore examined, and the results of these experiments are illustrated in Fig. 4. The addition of IL-8 induced only a very small increase in the rate of quenching of Fura-2 by Mn2+. On the other hand, Gro-α transiently, and significantly, stimulated the rate of decrease in the fluorescence of Fura-2, indicating that it had enhanced the rate of entry of Mn2+ into the cells. The binding of IL-8 to its two receptors was verified by demonstrating that Gro-α was inactive when added after IL-8. NAP-2 (100 nM) also increased the rate of Fura-2 quenching in the presence of MnCl2 (data not shown). Furthermore, the entry of Mn2+ inside the cells induced by Gro-α was completely blocked by the addition of 25 µM SK&F 96365 (data not shown). The cDNAs coding for IL-8RA and IL-8RB have been stably expressed in a human embryonic kidney cell line (15Hébert C.A. Chuntharapai A. Smith M. Colby T. Kim J. Horuk R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18549-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These transfectants express large numbers of IL-8 receptors (about 500,000/cell) that display binding affinities similar to those of the native neutrophil receptors (Kd = 2 nM). The ability of IL-8 and Gro-α to induce a pertussis toxin-sensitive mobilization of calcium in the expected transfectants (293 IL-8RA and IL-8RB for IL-8 and 293 IL-8RB for Gro-α) has also been demonstrated (12Damaj B.B. McColl S.R. Mahana W.N. Crouch M.F. Naccache P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12783-12789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The availability of these cell lines allows the direct testing of the responses to each receptor type, a possibility that neutrophils do not permit, since they express both receptors. In this series of experiments, 293 cells transfected with IL-8RA or IL-8RB were loaded with Indo-1/AM and stimulated with the indicated chemokines in the presence of Mn2+, and the rates of fluorescence quenching in response to IL-8 and Gro-α were monitored. Gro-α stimulated a rapid and significant decrease in Indo-1 fluorescence in 293 IL-8RB cells (Fig. 5A). IL-8 was without effect on its own in these cells, although its addition was able to inhibit the subsequent response to Gro-α (Fig. 5A), an inhibition that is likely due either to the occupation of the receptors by the saturating concentrations of the chemokines used in this assay (10−7 M) or to presently undefined desensitization mechanisms. Neither of the two chemokines induced significant changes in the rates of Mn2+ influx in 293 IL-8RA cells (Fig. 5B). A statistical analysis of the results of three such independent determinations confirmed these observations (Fig. 5B). The increased rate of Indo-1 quenching induced by Gro-α was inhibited by more than 95% by SK&F 96365 (data not shown). The present study was undertaken to examine the signal transduction pathways activated in human neutrophils and IL-8R-transfected 293 cells upon the activation of each of the two IL-8 receptor subtypes. Previous data indicate that the signal transduction pathways through IL-8RA and RB diverge at some point proximal to activation of phospholipase D, in vitro chemotaxis (as determined by the under-agarose method), and exocytosis (enhanced surface expression of CD11b/CD18) (14L'Heureux G. Bourgoin S. Jean N. McColl S.R. Naccache P.H. Blood. 1994; 85: 522-531Crossref Google Scholar). Although the binding affinities of IL-8 and Gro-α toward IL-8RA and IL-8RB are known (6Petersen F. Flad H.D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2467-2478PubMed Google Scholar, 8Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.-J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar) and some of the functional responses of neutrophils to these two chemokines have been identified (6Petersen F. Flad H.D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2467-2478PubMed Google Scholar, 21Clark-Lewis I. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the specific transduction pathways linked to the two IL-8R subtypes have only partially been examined. The results of this investigation have led to the novel observation that the two CXC chemokines activate distinct intracellular effector systems pertaining to the mobilization of calcium upon the ligation of IL-8RB. The modulation of the levels of free cytoplasmic free calcium represents one of the major signaling systems in mammalian cells (25Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Upon appropriate stimulation, calcium is derived from intracellular and extracellular sources by separate, although likely interdependent, mechanisms (25Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In the present study, several lines of evidence indicate that IL-8 and Gro-α rely to different extents on these two sources of calcium and, more specifically, that only Gro-α induces a significant influx of calcium in human neutrophils. The most direct confirmation of the differential effects of IL-8 and Gro-α on calcium influx in neutrophils was derived from the Mn2+ quenching experiments, which established that only Gro-α caused the opening of plasma membrane divalent cation channels. These data are in accordance with the differences in the shape of the calcium mobilization curves generated in response to IL-8 and Gro-α and with the differential sensitivity of intracellular calcium mobilization induced by IL-8 or Gro-α to EGTA and to the divalent cation channel inhibitor SK&F 96365. Previous studies indicate that IL-8 is significantly more potent than Gro-α in inducing activation of phospholipase D, up-regulation of surface expression of CD11b/CD18, and in vitro chemotaxis (14L'Heureux G. Bourgoin S. Jean N. McColl S.R. Naccache P.H. Blood. 1994; 85: 522-531Crossref Google Scholar). The present results extend these observations to the level of second messenger generation. It is unclear, however, whether a causal relationship exists between the opening of divalent cation channels and the functional responses previously monitored (i.e. phospholipase D, CD11b/CD18 expression, chemotaxis). The differences in the characteristics of the calcium responses of human neutrophils to IL-8 and Gro-α can be explained by postulating that the two receptor subtypes are coupled to distinct effector systems (i.e. only IL-8RB being linked to an increase in plasma permeability) or that the functional consequences of the occupation of IL-8RB by IL-8 or Gro-α are not equivalent. Since neutrophils express both receptor types, it is not possible to distinguish between these two hypotheses in this cellular system. Therefore, these alternative explanations were directly tested in 293 cells transfected with either IL-8RA or IL-8RB. The results of the experiments conducted with 293 cells provided significant support for the second alternative. The first hypothesis, i.e. that the two receptor subtypes are coupled to distinct effector systems, was effectively eliminated by the observation that IL-8 failed to stimulate a significant influx of calcium irrespective of whether it was bound to IL-8RA or IL-8RB. This result is in accord with the lack of effect of IL-8 on Mn2+ influx in neutrophils, even though IL-8 binds equally well to both receptor types. In contrast, Gro-α stimulated the influx of calcium in 293 IL-8RB cells as well as in neutrophils. This directly supports the second hypothesis. Thus, the data obtained with the transfected 293 cells not only corroborate those acquired in neutrophils, but they also provide strong evidence that the consequences of the occupation of IL-8RB depends on the agonist to which the cells are exposed. The mechanism(s) by which the cells discriminate between these two agonists that exhibit similar binding affinities toward this receptor (6Petersen F. Flad H.D. Brandt E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2467-2478PubMed Google Scholar, 8Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.-J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar) are unknown at present. They may be dependent, in part at least, on differences in the kinetics of binding of CXC chemokines to IL-8RB. In addition, it should be pointed out that while the molecular determinants of the binding of IL-8 to IL-8RA have been elucidated (26Leong S.R. Kabakoff R.C. Hébert C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19343-19348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only partial data are available with IL-8RB or with Gro-α. The latter indicate that IL-8, NAP-2, and Gro-α bind to distinct, although overlapping, sites on IL-8RB (27Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These data raise the possibility that these ligands induce different conformational changes in IL-8RB that lead to the differences in the responses observed in the present study. These results raise several intriguing questions that range from basic cell physiology to the biology of the CXC chemokines. The data obtained, although not derived from experiments designed to directly test this particular point, are clearly not well described by the capacitative model of calcium entry (25Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). IL-8 and Gro-α mobilize intracellular calcium to essentially identical extents, but only the latter stimulates calcium entry into the cells. The resolution of this apparent paradox is likely to prove difficult in view of our presently limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the plasma membrane divalent cation channels and of those concerning the interaction of chemokines with their receptors. Finally, the present data raise the other intriguing possibility that IL-8 and Gro-α are not functionally redundant chemokines but that they may posses distinct spectra of biological activities toward neutrophils and/or other inflammatory or immune cells. It is of particular interest that IL-8RB is expressed on a wider range of cell types including cells outside the immune system (28Pieper S.C. Horuk R. Horuk R. Chemoattractant Ligands and Their Receptors. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1996Google Scholar) and has been shown to mediate effects not associated with other chemokines. Such effects include the modulation of melanocyte growth (29Richmond A. Thomas H.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 84: 185-198Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and of collagen synthesis in synovial fibroblasts (30Unemori R.J.P. Amento E.P. Bauer E.A. Horuk R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2132069692,"The TCR couples antigen recognition and the transmission of activation signals. We report the expression of two TCR populations on the surface of T lymphocytes, one of which is linked to the cytoskeleton via the zeta chain. We also demonstrate that assembly of the CD3 subunits with cytoskeleton-associated zeta is necessary for their maximal localization to the cytoskeleton. The potential significance of these two receptor forms is underscored by differences observed in non-activated T cells; while detergent-soluble phosphorylated zeta appears as a 21-kDa protein, phosphorylated cytoskeleton-associated zeta appears as a 16-kDa form. This dichotomous phosphorylation pattern is rigidly maintained following activation, although each of the receptor populations undergoes different activation-dependent modifications: 1) levels of soluble phosphorylated 21-kDa zeta are enhanced, while phosphorylated 16-kDa cytoskeleton-associated zeta exhibits little change; 2) soluble non-phosphorylated 16-kDa zeta translocates to the cytoskeleton; 3) activation-dependent ubiquitinated zeta forms localize to both fractions, albeit with different kinetics. We also show that the protein tyrosine kinase Lck undergoes activation-dependent modifications and translocates to the cytoskeleton. The phosphorylation profiles of the dichotomous TCR populations in both non-activated and activated lymphocytes suggest that each population could regulate distinct cellular functions, possibly by select intermolecular associations."
https://openalex.org/W2014905760,"The numerous isoforms of murine CD44 contain a common peptide region that is encoded by exons 1-5, 16-18, and 20 and variant regions derived from exons 6-15, usually referred to as v1-v10. We have obtained evidence for expression of an additional exon between v9 (or exon 14) and the exon previously termed v10 (or exon 15). Thus, we now number the variant exons as follows: v1-v9 (exons 6-14), v10 (exon 15), and v11 (exon 16); the remaining 3′-exons become exons 17–21 (newly numbered exons are underlined). The new exon, now termed exon v10, contains 93 base pairs and can be internally spliced; the 5′-region is termed v10a, and the 3′-region, v10b. Stop codons are positioned in v10a such that translated protein would be truncated prior to the transmembrane domain and secreted as a soluble protein. We have also found that the previously described v9 exon (now termed v9a), which is 90 base pairs in length, is actually the 5′-region of a longer exon of 142 base pairs (the 3′-region is termed v9b) and thus arises by internal splicing of the longer exon. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, four different cDNAs for CD44 isoforms that use different combinations of the new exonic sequences have been found. The mRNAs containing the new exonic sequences are restricted in their expression; to date, we have demonstrated their presence in murine G8 myoblasts in culture and in embryonic muscle and cartilage tissues in vivo. Of these new isoforms, the predominant, full-length amplified product is encoded by exons 1-5, exon 13 (v8), the 5′-part of exon 14 (v9a), exon 15 (v10), exon 16 (v11), exons 17–19, and exon 21. When COS-7 cells were transfected with v10-containing cDNA constructs, the cells secreted low molecular weight soluble CD44 into their medium. Thus, the stop codons within the new exon v10 provide a molecular basis for de novo synthesis of soluble CD44 isoforms. The numerous isoforms of murine CD44 contain a common peptide region that is encoded by exons 1-5, 16-18, and 20 and variant regions derived from exons 6-15, usually referred to as v1-v10. We have obtained evidence for expression of an additional exon between v9 (or exon 14) and the exon previously termed v10 (or exon 15). Thus, we now number the variant exons as follows: v1-v9 (exons 6-14), v10 (exon 15), and v11 (exon 16); the remaining 3′-exons become exons 17–21 (newly numbered exons are underlined). The new exon, now termed exon v10, contains 93 base pairs and can be internally spliced; the 5′-region is termed v10a, and the 3′-region, v10b. Stop codons are positioned in v10a such that translated protein would be truncated prior to the transmembrane domain and secreted as a soluble protein. We have also found that the previously described v9 exon (now termed v9a), which is 90 base pairs in length, is actually the 5′-region of a longer exon of 142 base pairs (the 3′-region is termed v9b) and thus arises by internal splicing of the longer exon. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, four different cDNAs for CD44 isoforms that use different combinations of the new exonic sequences have been found. The mRNAs containing the new exonic sequences are restricted in their expression; to date, we have demonstrated their presence in murine G8 myoblasts in culture and in embryonic muscle and cartilage tissues in vivo. Of these new isoforms, the predominant, full-length amplified product is encoded by exons 1-5, exon 13 (v8), the 5′-part of exon 14 (v9a), exon 15 (v10), exon 16 (v11), exons 17–19, and exon 21. When COS-7 cells were transfected with v10-containing cDNA constructs, the cells secreted low molecular weight soluble CD44 into their medium. Thus, the stop codons within the new exon v10 provide a molecular basis for de novo synthesis of soluble CD44 isoforms."

The endocytic behavior of this chimera was characterized in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The GTCTR chimera had a more predominant intracellular distribution compared to the TR. Only 20% of the GTCTR chimera is on the surface at steady-state compared to 35% of the TR. The GTCTR chimera is internalized 50% more rapidly and recycled 20% more slowly than the TR. Acidification of the cytosol inhibited internalization of the GTCTR chimera, indicating that the chimera is internalized through clathrin-coated pits. Mutations of GTCTR were constructed in which a di-leucine sequence of the carboxyl domain of GLUT4 was mutated to a di-alanine sequence (GTCTR-AA) and serine residue 488, immediately preceding the di-leucine sequence, was mutated to either an alanine or aspartate residue. In each case, albeit to varying degrees, the substitutions shifted the distribution of the mutated GTCTR constructs toward the surface. The shift in the distribution of GTCTR-AA resulted from a 10-fold reduction in internalization, and the shift of serine 488 mutants resulted from a 3-fold reduction in the internalization rate compared to GTCTR. None of these mutations affected the recycling rate. These results demonstrate that the carboxyl terminus of GLUT4 contains a serine-leucine-leucine-based motif that, when expressed in non-insulin responsive cells, functions as a potent internalization motif which promotes more rapid internalization than does the native TR internalization motif.

Cossat A. Weil J.-H. Dietrich A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and yeast (10Tarassov I.A. Entelis N.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1277-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) has also been reported. Recently, in vitro systems were developed for studying this process in yeast (10Tarassov I.A. Entelis N.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1277-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and Leishmania (11Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Two alternative models have been considered to explain the transport of a negatively charged RNA molecule across the double mitochondrial membrane. In one scheme, RNA complexed to a cytoplasmic protein is internalized via the well established protein import pathways (12Nagley P. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 67-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Recent studies in yeast suggest that tRNALys1 import occurs as a ribonucleoprotein through the MOM19 protein import receptor (13Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For tRNA, the cognate aminoacyl tRNA synthetase has been proposed to be the carrier protein (14Suyama Y. Hamada J. Bucher T. Neupert W. Sebald W Werner S. Genetics and Biogenesis of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1967: 763-770Google Scholar), but the observation that in Trypanosoma brucei, mutated unspliced tRNATyr, which cannot be aminoacylated, is still imported efficiently (7Schneider A. Martin J. Agabian N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2317-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) would appear to contradict this idea. Alternatively, naked RNA may be directly imported through recognition by membrane-bound RNA binding receptor proteins and specific import channels. Our previous experiments with Leishmania mitochondria showing import of RNA in the absence of cytosolic proteins, in a sequence-specific, saturable, and ATP-dependent manner (11Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggested the second mechanism, but direct evidence was lacking. In addition to tRNAs and certain small ribosomal RNAs, synthetic transcripts from the 5′-untranslated region of the Leishmania β-tubulin gene are imported in vitro. The antisense RNAs are absent in vivo (15Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) but share purine-rich sequence motifs with the D stem-loop regions of kinetoplastid tRNAs (Ref. 11Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1). Moreover, import of antisense RNA is inhibited by tRNA and vice versa (11Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and both types of RNA bind to a 15-kDa heat stable protein (15Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For quantitative studies of the import mechanism, it is necessary to use a single species of RNA labeled to high specific activity; terminally labeled tRNA mixtures isolated from cellular RNA are therefore unsuitable. Because high specific activity antisense transcripts can be easily synthesized in vitro, we have employed them as a sensitive probe for the import process. In the present study, we have investigated the presence of import receptors on the mitochondrial surface and examined the relationship between binding and internalization of RNA in order to distinguish between the co-import and direct import models. Promastigotes of Leishmania strain UR6 (a viscerotropic tropica-like strain) were cultured on solid blood agar as described previously (16Das S. Adhya S. J. Biosci. 1990; 15: 239-248Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial vesicles were prepared by hypotonic cell lysis, DNase treatment, and Percoll gradient centrifugation (11Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Harris M.E. Moore D.R. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11368-11376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For some experiments, the mitochondrial band was diluted with isotonic sucrose and rerun on a second gradient in order to minimize contamination with cellular debris. Clone pSG3B contains sequences between −53 and +25 of the Leishmania β-tubulin gene in transcription vector pSPT19 (15Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). EcoRI- or HindIII-linearized plasmid was transcribed with T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase to generate antisense or sense RNA, respectively (15Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Leishmania tRNA was isolated from poly(A)− RNA by denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Yeast tRNA was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Unless otherwise specified, binding assays (10 µl) contained 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM ATP, 6.7 mM creatine phosphate, 60 µg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 32P-labeled RNA (0.1-100 fmol), and 5 µl of mitochondrial suspension (about 40 µg of protein). After incubation at 25°C, vesicles were washed twice with 1 ml of STE-B (0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by low speed centrifugation. Bound RNA was released by deproteinization, purified by ethanol precipitation, and electrophoresed on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. After autoradiography of the dried gel, the amount of bound RNA was quantified by liquid scintillation counting of the excised band or by scanning the autoradiograms in an Ultro Scan laser densitometer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Internalization of RNA within mitochondria was assayed by RNase protection as described previously (11Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria (10 µl in a total volume of 20 µl) were incubated at 25°C with 32P-labeled RNA in binding buffer (see above) lacking KCl (unless otherwise specified) and then treated with a mixture of RNase A (2 mg/ml) and T1 (40000 units/ml) for 15 min at 25°C. Mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation and deproteinized for analysis of RNase-resistant RNA by gel electrophoresis. Mitochondrial vesicles (200 µg of protein) were treated with 10 µg/ml trypsin for 20 min on ice. Trypsin was inactivated with 90 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor for 10 min. Trypsinized vesicles were washed twice with STE-B and either suspended at 4-8 mg/ml in storage buffer (11Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or boiled in SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviation used is: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. sample buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar) for electrophoresis. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins from twice purified mitochondria were resolved by SDS-12% PAGE according to Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar) and then electroblotted on nitrocellulose (18Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44841) Google Scholar). To renature proteins in situ, the blot was washed four times with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, each for 30 min at 4°C with gentle agitation. The filter was then blocked with buffer BB (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol) containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% Triton X-100, and incubated with 32P-labeled RNA (106 cpm/ml) in BB containing 0.01% Triton X-100 for 4 h at 4°C. After three washes with BB (each for 5 min at 4°C), the filter was autoradiographed. Mitochondria were extracted with 0.4% Triton X-100 in STE-B, and the cleared extract was assayed for succinate dehydrogenase essentially as described (19Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Reactions (1 ml) contained 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 20 mM sodium succinate, 0.01 mM EDTA, 70 mM 2,6-dichloroindophenol, and 1.6 mM phenazine methosulfate. After the addition of extract the reduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenol was monitored spectrophotometrically at 600 nm. The amount of 2,6-dichloroindophenol reduced was calculated on the basis of its extinction coefficient ϵ = 21 mM−1 cm−1. In view of the evidence that synthetic antisense transcripts and Leishmania tRNAs utilize a common import pathway (11Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a comparison of their primary and secondary structures was undertaken. As shown in Fig. 1, antisense RNA contains the sequence AUGGCAGAG in the loop of a putative hairpin structure. tRNAThr(AGU) from Leishmania tarentolae contains the identical sequence in the D stem-loop region, whereas tRNATyr(GUA) contains the homologous sequence AUUGGUAGAG in the same location (6Lye L.-F. Chen D.-H. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similar structures are conserved in four other Trypanosoma tRNA species known to be mitochondrially imported. 2S. Bera and S. Adhya, unpublished data. In contrast, the D stem-loop of tRNAGln(CUG), which is not imported (6Lye L.-F. Chen D.-H. Suyama Y. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), contains no such homology (Fig. 1). No significant homology between antisense RNA and any other part of the tRNA cloverleaf was detected. The observed sequence and/or structural similarity explains the action of antisense RNA as a molecular mimic of tRNA for import receptor recognition. It was previously observed that import of RNA into isolated Leishmania mitochondria occurs after a pronounced lag (11Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The delay could be due to either slow binding of RNA to mitochondrial surface receptors or rapid binding followed by slow internalization. To distinguish between these possibilities, mitochondria were incubated with 32P-labeled β-tubulin antisense RNA, the vesicles were washed, and bound RNA was estimated by gel electrophoresis. At 25°C in the absence of ATP, binding was detectable within 5 min, remained stable until 15 min, and then rose steadily (Fig. 2, A and D). In presence of ATP, binding was faster and reached a maximum by 15 min (Fig. 2, B and D). The final amounts of complex formed in the two cases were similar (Fig. 2D); therefore, ATP affects the rate but not the yield of the reaction. This rapid binding was in contrast to the slow rate of import, which was detectable only after 30 min (Fig. 2, C and D; see also Ref. 11Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Maximum levels of import were reached at 45 min; the subsequent decline in the level of internalized RNA has been occasionally observed (11Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and is attributable to intramitochondrial nuclease activity; the recovery of normal levels of mitochondrial tRNA (data not shown) ruled out the possibility of losses during purification. Binding of antisense RNA was concentration-dependent (Fig. 3A, lanes 5-8). Little or no binding of the corresponding sense strand (which is not imported; Ref. 11Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was observed (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-4), as expected for a sequence-specific interaction. Saturation was approached at about 25 nM RNA (Fig. 3B); at very high concentrations, considerable nonspecific binding occurred. In separate experiments performed at 5 nM RNA concentration at 25°C in the presence of ATP, the level of bound RNA averaged 0.297 ± 0.041 fmol/µg mitochondrial protein, of which 0.031 ± 0.004 fmol/µg, i.e. about 10%, was imported. This indicates formation of nonproductive complexes and/or limitation of some essential component in the in vitro system. The RNA·mitochondrion complex detected above could represent a functional import intermediate or a nonproductive interaction. Therefore, 15-min complexes were washed free of excess RNA, reincubated in the absence of RNA, and assayed for import by RNase protection. When a complex formed in absence of ATP was incubated without ATP, no import occurred (Fig. 4, lane 2), but the addition of ATP in the second step resulted in import (Fig. 4, lane 3), although the amount internalized was about 2-fold less than in the single-step incubation (Fig. 4, lane 1), possibly due to losses during the washing step. On the other hand, complexes formed in the presence of ATP did not require ATP in the second step for import to occur (Fig. 4, lane 4), and ATP added subsequently had no effect (Fig. 4, lane 5). These results show that at least some of the complexes formed in the absence or the presence of ATP are true intermediates in the sense that the bound RNA can be internalized. However, continued presence of ATP outside the mitochondrion appears to be unnecessary. The internal pool of ATP created by the mitochondrial ATP-ADP carrier may be sufficient to maintain normal levels of import, but other explanations cannot be ruled out at this stage. To determine the affinity of RNA-receptor interaction, quantitative binding assays were performed at different RNA concentrations (Fig. 5A). Scatchard analysis of the data revealed a nonlinear, biphasic curve (Fig. 5B). From the slopes of the extrapolated linear portions of the latter curve, it was estimated that there are two classes of RNA binding site with apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of 0.3 and 10 nM, present at concentrations ([R]t) of 0.4 and 4.7 nM, respectively. Because the protein content of pure vesicles and the extent of contamination of these preparations with other proteins are not precisely known, it is difficult to accurately calculate the number of receptors per mitochondrion, but based on previous observations (5 mg of mitochondrial protein/2 × 1010 cells containing 1 mitochondrion/cell; Ref. 22Harris M.E. Moore D.R. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11368-11376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we estimate about 15 molecules of the high affinity receptor and 175 molecules of the low affinity receptor per organelle. These numbers are provisional and subject to future revision. Because the β-tubulin antisense transcript used in these assays is absent in vivo (15Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the relevance of the data to tRNA import may be questioned. However, competition assays showed that binding of labeled antisense RNA (present at 10 nM) was inhibited by Leishmania tRNA but not by yeast tRNA (Fig. 6). The tRNA concentration for 50% inhibition of binding was 20 nM, similar to that for self-competition by antisense RNA. Thus, the bulk of the homologous tRNA shares a common sequence element for receptor binding that is absent from yeast tRNA. Binding as well as internalization of RNA were sensitive to mild trypsinization of the mitochondrial vesicles (Fig. 7A), indicating the involvement of surface proteins. To identify the putative RNA binding receptor, a Northwestern blot analysis (15Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was performed. A Western blot of mitochondrial proteins was probed with labeled antisense RNA. A single band with an apparent molecular mass close to 15 kDa was observed (Fig. 7B, lane 1). No significant band was detected with the corresponding sense strand (control) probe (data not shown). Treatment of mitochondria with trypsin prior to SDS-PAGE resulted in disappearance of this band (Fig. 7B, lane 2). Under the trypsinization conditions used, most of the mitochondrial proteins were unaffected (as determined by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE resolved proteins; data not shown), and the activity of the inner mitochondrial membrane marker succinate dehydrogenase was retained (Fig. 7C). These data indicate that the 15-kDa protein is located on the outer membrane with an externally oriented RNA binding domain. The response of the binding and internalization steps to mono- and polyvalent ions was investigated. Binding was insensitive to KCl up to 0.1 M; above this concentration, binding was reduced about 2-fold. In contrast, import was inhibited 10-fold above 0.1 M KCl, but the residual activity was resistant to higher concentrations (Fig. 8A). The polyanion heparin was ineffective up to 1 mg/ml in the binding step but quantitatively inhibited internalization at only 20 µg/ml (Fig. 8B). Polynucleotides such as poly(A) and poly(U) had no effect on binding or internalization at 0.1 mg/ml; at 10-fold higher concentration, neither polynucleotide significantly affected binding but completely inhibited import (data not shown). These results are consistent with the occurrence of highly stable and specific, perhaps nonionic, interactions between the receptor and RNA, followed by one or more transfer steps involving more labile, ionic linkages. In this report, evidence was presented for the occurrence of at least one high affinity import receptor for RNA on the surface of Leishmania mitochondria. It was further shown that the binding and internalization steps could be functionally separated on the basis of their biochemical properties. The results point to a unique mechanism for the uptake of cytoplasmic RNAs by the kinetoplast-mitochondrion. Mitochondrial vesicles bind importable RNAs with high affinity and specificity to form functional import intermediates. The biphasic Scatchard curve (Fig. 5B) suggests the presence of multiple binding proteins or negative cooperativity, i.e. reduced affinity at higher RNA concentrations. Because import is saturated between 1 and 4 nM RNA (11Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the high affinity site (Kd = 0.3 nM), is likely to be more relevant to import than the low affinity site (Kd = 10 nM). A 15-kDa surface protein has many of the expected characteristics of an import receptor. It binds RNA in a sequence-specific manner on Northwestern blots at a probe concentration of only about 0.1 nM (Fig. 7), which indicates a high affinity interaction. We have previously reported the presence of a similar or identical protein in extracts of Leishmania promastigotes (15Ghosh A. Ghosh T. Ghosh S. Das S. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or isolated mitochondria (11Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which binds to tRNA and other small RNAs that are imported in vitro, to form salt- and heparin-resistant complexes, as oberved here with intact mitochondria. Recent immunochemical experiments confirm the role of this protein in RNA import, 3S. Mahapatra and S. Adhya, unpublished observations. but whether additional RNA binding proteins are required remains an open question. Receptor recognition is sequence-specific (Fig. 2) and species-specific (Fig. 6). The fact that the majority of Leishmania and Trypanosoma tRNAs are imported argues for the existence of a common primary and/or secondary structure on these RNAs acting as the import signal. Two different heterologous tRNA species from yeast and man, respectively, are apparently imported into Trypanosoma mitochondria (8Hauser R. Schneider A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4212-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a result interpreted to implicate the tRNA structure as a whole as the recognition element. However, in our system, antisense transcripts, which lack a tRNA-like cloverleaf structure, are imported, and total yeast tRNA is ineffective in inhibiting receptor binding (Fig. 6) or import (11Mahapatra S. Ghosh T. Adhya S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3381-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is probable that a short sequence motif shared by all importable RNAs, rather than an elaborate secondary structure, is critical. Sequence analysis pointed to the importance of the nonanucleotide AUGGPyAGAG for receptor recognition (Fig. 1). Our recent structure-function studies support this conclusion.3 It has been suggested that import of tRNALys1 into yeast mitochondria occurs through the protein import pathway as a complex with a carrier protein containing an import presequence (13Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The properties of the Leishmania system appear to be different. Whereas import of yeast tRNALys1 requires a cytosolic protein fraction (10Tarassov I.A. Entelis N.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1277-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), binding as well as import of RNA into Leishmania mitochondria is direct, and cytosolic protein fractions have no effect.3 The putative RNA import receptor in Leishmania is a 15-kDa protein (Fig. 7), whereas the 19-kDa MOM 19 protein import receptor is implicated in yeast (13Tarassov I. Entelis N. Martin R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, binding of import presequences is transient and salt-sensitive (20Haucke V. Lithgow T. Rospert S. Hahne K. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5565-5570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Mayer A. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Lill R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4204-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), reflecting the presence of salt bridges between the acidic cytosolic domain of the receptor and the positively charged amphiphilic presequence. In marked contrast, binding of RNA to Leishmania receptors is salt- and heparin-resistant, whereas import is sensitive to both reagents (Fig. 8). This indicates that the initial RNA-receptor interaction is stable, followed by one or more transfer steps involving unstable ionic linkages. One possibility is the presence of cationic import channels through which negatively charged RNA is extruded by transient salt bridging. Further studies on the structure of the import receptor as well as that of the RNA import signal will shed more light on this important question.

INTRODUCTIONGalNAc is an important sugar in complex carbohydrates since it is usually the sugar that links the carbohydrate chains to protein in mucins (1Devine P.L. McKenzie I.F.C.

In these glycoproteins, the linkage usually involves a GalNAc to serine or threonine attachment site. GalNAc is also found in many of the glycosphingolipids that are present in animal cell membranes (7Ilyas A.S. Quarles R.H. Dalakas M.C. Brady R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6697-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Hakomori S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 733-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar) and is a major component of some proteoglycans such as chondroitin sulfates (9Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 229-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar).The current dogma on the formation and activation of GalNAc in animal cells is as follows (10Davidson E. Balazs E. Jeanloz R. The Aminosugars. Academic Press, New York1966: 2Google Scholar). Fru-6-P+Gln→GlcN-6-P+glutamate(Eq. 1) GlcN-6-P+acetyl-CoA→GlcNAc-6-P+CoASH(Eq. 2) GlcNAc-6-P⇌GlcNAc-1-P(Eq. 3) GlcNAc-1-P+UTP⇌UDP-GlcNAc+PPi(Eq. 4) UDP-GlcNAc⇌UDP-GalNac(Eq. 5) In this report, we demonstrate the presence in pig kidney and some other pig tissues of a new enzyme that phosphorylates free GalNAc at position 1 to produce GalNAc-α-1-P. This enzyme has been extensively purified from the cytosol of the kidney. The purified enzyme phosphorylates GalNAc, but not galactose, galactosamine, glucose, GlcNAc, or glucosamine. This enzyme may represent part of a salvage pathway that allows the organism to reutilize the free GalNAc that arises from the turnover of O-linked glycoproteins and other complex carbohydrates. In this regard, it is important to note that we recently purified a UDP-HexNAc pyrophosphorylase from pig liver (and kidney) that catalyzes the formation either of UDP-GlcNAc from UTP and GlcNAc-1-P or of UDP-GalNAc from UTP and GalNAc-1-P (11Szumilo T.

Although the measured Km for GalNAc-1-P is somewhat high, this enzyme may still function as a UDP-GalNAc pyrophosphorylase in certain tissues or under particular conditions. Thus, some animal tissues appear to have the necessary enzymes to convert free GalNAc to its “activated” form, i.e. UDP-GalNAc, for polymerization without the intervention of UDP-GlcNAc.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[6-3H]Glucosamine (40 Ci/mmol), [1-3H]galactosamine (10-25 Ci/mmol), [6-3H]galactose (20 Ci/mmol), [1-3H]GalNAc (10-25 Ci/mmol), [6-3H]GlcNAc (20-30 Ci/mmol), UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc (25 Ci/mmol), and UDP-[6-3H]GalNAc (15 Ci/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. Unlabeled sugars, sugar phosphates, and nucleoside diphosphate sugars were obtained from Sigma. Various adsorbents were obtained from the following sources: DEAE-cellulose (DE52) from Whatman and Polybuffer Exchanger 94, Sephacryl S-300, red Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, and DEAE-Cibacron blue 3GA from Sigma. Polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates were purchased from EM Science, cellulose TLC plates were from Eastman Kodak Co., and silica gel TLC plates were from Merck. The following materials were obtained from Bio-Rad: SDS, acrylamide, bisacrylamide, Coomassie Blue, protein assay reagent, hydroxylapatite, and Affi-Gel 501. All other chemicals were from reliable commercial sources and were of the best grade available.GalNAc Kinase AssayGalNAc kinase activity was assayed in incubation mixtures of 100 µl containing the following components: 200 µM [3H]GalNAc (30,000 cpm), 5 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM NaF, 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, and various amounts of the enzyme preparations to be assayed. Following an incubation for the appropriate time (usually 5 min), the reaction was stopped by heating at 100°C for 1 min, and the incubation mixture was applied to a column of DE52. The column was washed with at least 5 column volumes of 10 mM (NH4)HCO3 to remove unbound material, and then GalNAc phosphate was eluted with 500 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Aliquots of the wash and eluent were removed and assayed for their radioactive content by scintillation counting.Purification of GalNAc KinaseStep 1: Preparation of Crude ExtractFresh pig kidneys from a local slaughterhouse were generally used in these studies, but kidney could be quick-frozen and used at a later time with equally good results. The kidneys were cut into small pieces and homogenized in Buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 µg/ml pepstatin A) in a Waring blender for 3-4 min. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 50 min, and the supernatant liquid was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant liquid was used in subsequent purification steps.Step 2: Ammonium Sulfate PrecipitationSolid ammonium sulfate was added to the above crude extract to reach 35% saturation, and after standing on ice for 15 min, the solution was centrifuged. The precipitate was discarded, and solid ammonium sulfate was slowly added with stirring to the supernatant liquid to reach 60% saturation. After standing on ice for 15 min, the solution was centrifuged to obtain the precipitate, which was dissolved in Buffer A containing 1 M ammonium sulfate.Step 3: Phenyl-Sepharose Column ChromatographyThe dissolved enzyme was applied to a 2.5 × 28-cm column of phenyl-Sepharose that had been equilibrated with Buffer A containing 1 M ammonium sulfate. The column was then washed with the equilibration buffer until the filtrate was almost colorless. The kinase was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 1 to 0 M ammonium sulfate in Buffer A. Ten-ml fractions were collected, and active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A, with several changes of the dialysis fluid during the 12-h dialysis time.Step 4: DE52-Cellulose ChromatographyDE52-cellulose was suspended in Buffer A, adjusted to pH 7.8 with dilute HCl, and the slurry was used to pack a 2 × 30-cm column. This column was then equilibrated with Buffer A. The dialyzed enzyme from the phenyl-Sepharose column was applied to the DE52 column, which was washed with Buffer A containing 20 mM NaCl. The enzyme was eluted with 300 ml of a linear gradient of 20-200 mM NaCl in Buffer A. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated to ∼10 ml on an Amicon apparatus using a PM-10 membrane, and dialyzed against Buffer B (5 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mM EDTA).Step 5: Hydroxylapatite Column ChromatographyThe dialyzed enzyme from Step 4 was loaded on a 2.5 × 5-cm column of hydroxylapatite that had been equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was washed well with Buffer B, and the enzyme was then eluted with a 5-40 mM linear gradient of phosphate buffer. The enzyme activity emerged from the column at ∼10-25 mM sodium phosphate buffer. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated by Amicon filtration, and Buffer B was exchanged for Buffer C (20 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol) by continually adding Buffer C to the concentrated enzyme solution and concentrating on the filter (three to seven times).Step 6: Red Sepharose ChromatographyThe concentrated enzyme fraction from the hydroxylapatite chromatography step was applied to a 1.5 × 8-cm column of red Sepharose 3000 CL that had been equilibrated with Buffer C. The column was then washed with Buffer C, and the enzyme activity emerged in the wash.Step 7: Aminohexyl-Agarose ChromatographyThe active enzyme from the red Sepharose chromatography step was applied to an aminohexyl-Sepharose column (1.5 × 12 cm) that had been equilibrated with Buffer C. The column was washed with Buffer C, and the enzyme was eluted with 150 ml of a linear gradient of 0-140 mM NaCl in Buffer C. Fractions containing the active enzyme were pooled, and NaCl was removed by filtration on an Amicon apparatus.Step 8: DEAE-Cibacron Blue ChromatographyThe enzyme solution from Step 7 was applied to a 1.5 × 5-cm column of DEAE-Cibacron Blue 3GA, and the column was washed with 1.5 mM ATP in Buffer C. The enzyme was then eluted with a linear gradient of 1.5-8 mM ATP in Buffer C. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated several times in the presence of 20 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM ATP and 10% glycerol to remove Buffer C and β-mercaptoethanol.Step 9: Affi-Gel 501-Agarose ChromatographyAn Affi-Gel 501 organomercurial-agarose column (0.9 × 7 cm) was equilibrated with 20 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM ATP and 10% glycerol. The enzyme from Step 8 was applied to the column, which was then washed with the same buffer. The enzyme was then eluted with a 0-20 mM gradient of dithiothreitol. The enzyme emerged from this column at ∼6-10 mM dithiothreitol. The enzyme was concentrated to a small volume and stored in 20 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10% glycerol.Native and SDS Gel ElectrophoresisNative PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyGARPglobally optimized alternating phase rectangular pulse. was performed as described by Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) with an 8% gel and a discontinuous buffer system, but under nondenaturing conditions. Two samples were run in parallel: one lane was stained with Coomassie Blue to detect proteins, and the other lane was cut into 1-cm pieces for assay of enzyme activity. SDS-PAGE was done as described (13Kaushal G.P. Szumilo T. Pastuszak I. Elbein A.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2168-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Prior to electrophoresis, protein samples were mixed with the same buffer (62 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) and heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min.Product CharacterizationLarge-scale incubations were prepared with radioactive GalNAc in order to isolate sufficient amounts of product for characterization. These large-scale incubations contained the same components as in the GalNAc kinase assay mixtures, but were scaled up by a factor of 10. After incubation, the reactions were stopped by heating, and the product was isolated by chromatography on a column of DE52.The radioactive material was examined for purity and characterization by paper chromatography on Whatman No. 3MM paper in 70% ethanol and 1 M ammonium acetate, pH 7.5 (7:3), or in 70% ethanol and 1 M ammonium acetate, pH 3.5 (7:3). The product was also subjected to HPLC on a Dionex apparatus using a column designed to separate various sugar phosphates from each other. Sugar 1-phosphates were distinguished from sugar 6-phosphates by their susceptibility to acid hydrolysis in 0.05 N HCl at 100°C. Under these conditions, sugar 1-phosphates are rapidly hydrolyzed, whereas sugar 6-phosphates are quite stable.The phosphorylated sugar product was also characterized by NMR spectroscopy. 300-mHz proton NMR and 31P-decoupled (GARP) NMR on the sample of GalNAc-1-P were performed on a Bruker ARX300 NMR apparatus. Data were acquired in D2O at pH 6.0.DISCUSSIONThis study reports the identification and purification of a new phosphorylating enzyme in pig kidney and liver that transfers a phosphate group from ATP to GalNAc to form GalNAc-α-1-P. A previous study by Maley et al. (16Maley F. Tarentino A.L. McGarrahan J.F. DelGiacco R. Biochem. J. 1968; 107: 637-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated the formation of GalNAc-1-P from GalNAc and ATP by a crude extract from rat liver, but it was not clear from that study whether that activity was due to the enzyme galactokinase or to another kinase that could utilize GalNAc as a substrate.More recently, a very interesting and useful Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant, referred to as IdlD, was isolated and shown to be missing the enzyme that converts UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-GalNAc, i.e. the UDP-GalNAc 4-epimerase (17Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Hobbie L. Krieger M. Cell. 1986; 44: 749-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This mutant, when grown in the absence of GalNAc or galactose, is defective in both O- and N-linked glycosylation because it cannot synthesize the necessary precursors, UDP-galactose and UDP-GalNAc. However, supplementation of the medium with free galactose and GalNAc allows the mutant cells to produce normal N- and O-linked glycoproteins (18Matzuk M.M. Krieger M. Corless C.L. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6354-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Reddy P. Caras I. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17329-17336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that these cells might contain another “scavenger” pathway that involves a kinase and a pyrophosphorylase for the production of the nucleoside diphosphate sugar precursors. However, these enzymes were not demonstrated in that study, nor were their specificities determined.Recent studies from our laboratory have identified a UDP-HexNAc pyrophosphorylase in pig liver and kidney that can condense GalNAc-1-P and UTP to produce UDP-GalNAc (11Szumilo T. Zeng Y. Pastuszak I. Drake R. Szumilo H. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast to previous reports on the UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase, which indicated that this enzyme had very low activity toward UDP-GalNAc (3%) as compared with UDP-GlcNAc (100%) (20Strominger J.L. Smith M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1822-1827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pattabiraman T.N. Bachhawat B.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 50: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the pig liver and kidney UDP-HexNAc pyrophosphorylase works nearly as well with GalNAc-1-P and UDP-GalNAc as substrates as it does with GlcNAc-1-P and UDP-GlcNAc, although the affinity of the enzyme is much lower for GalNAc than for GlcNAc derivatives. Based on the specificity of the GalNAc kinase for GalNAc but not galactose and the activity of the UDP-HexNAc pyrophosphorylase toward GalNAc-1-P, it seems likely that these two enzymes do represent a specific salvage mechanism to reutilize GalNAc that is produced in the kidney and liver by the turnover of O-linked glycoproteins.Thus, there now appears to be two different mechanisms for producing UDP-GalNAc. The major pathway would be from Fru-6-P via GlcNAc-6-P and UDP-GlcNAc to form UDP-GalNAc by the UDP-galactose (GalNAc) 4-epimerase. The second pathway is the one described here with the GalNAc-1-P kinase and the UDP-HexNAc pyrophosphorylase. This second pathway would mostly depend on the production of GalNAc from the turnover of O-linked glycoproteins and glycolipids. We have already found that the kinase is present in HT-29 cells, but it will be interesting to determine the distribution and level of these two enzymes in other cultured cells. INTRODUCTIONGalNAc is an important sugar in complex carbohydrates since it is usually the sugar that links the carbohydrate chains to protein in mucins (1Devine P.L. McKenzie I.F.C.

The Aminosugars. Academic Press, New York1966: 2Google Scholar). Fru-6-P+Gln→GlcN-6-P+glutamate(Eq. 1) GlcN-6-P+acetyl-CoA→GlcNAc-6-P+CoASH(Eq. 2) GlcNAc-6-P⇌GlcNAc-1-P(Eq. 3) GlcNAc-1-P+UTP⇌UDP-GlcNAc+PPi(Eq. 4) UDP-GlcNAc⇌UDP-GalNac(Eq. 5) In this report, we demonstrate the presence in pig kidney and some other pig tissues of a new enzyme that phosphorylates free GalNAc at position 1 to produce GalNAc-α-1-P. This enzyme has been extensively purified from the cytosol of the kidney. The purified enzyme phosphorylates GalNAc, but not galactose, galactosamine, glucose, GlcNAc, or glucosamine. This enzyme may represent part of a salvage pathway that allows the organism to reutilize the free GalNAc that arises from the turnover of O-linked glycoproteins and other complex carbohydrates. In this regard, it is important to note that we recently purified a UDP-HexNAc pyrophosphorylase from pig liver (and kidney) that catalyzes the formation either of UDP-GlcNAc from UTP and GlcNAc-1-P or of UDP-GalNAc from UTP and GalNAc-1-P (11Szumilo T.

Although the measured Km for GalNAc-1-P is somewhat high, this enzyme may still function as a UDP-GalNAc pyrophosphorylase in certain tissues or under particular conditions. Thus, some animal tissues appear to have the necessary enzymes to convert free GalNAc to its “activated” form, i.e. UDP-GalNAc, for polymerization without the intervention of UDP-GlcNAc."

In this paper we present evidence suggesting that c-Met constitutive activation in liver-specific B16 melanoma cells depends on both receptor concentration on the cell surface and a cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase activity. In fact, c-Met constitutive activation is suddenly lost upon detachment of the cells from the substrate and is dramatically decreased in adherent cells plated at low density. The loss of tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met in suspension appears to depend, at least partly, on an increased cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase activity. Instead, lower activation of c-Met at low density mostly results from a decrease in receptor concentration on the membrane. Moreover, we show that c-Met activation does not occur homogeneously on the surface of adherent cells. In fact, receptor concentration and activation appear to be higher on the ventral surface (adherent to the substrate) than on the apical surface. Upon detachment, compartmentalization is lost, leading to a decrease in average receptor density on the plasma membrane and hence to a lower activation.

Michalopoulos G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1177-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). All of the biological effects of HGF/SF are transduced through its cellular receptor, the product of the c-met proto-oncogene, by the activation of its tyrosine kinase domain and the phosphorylation of a multifunctional docking site, which is responsible for the engagement of downstream mediators (2Prat M. Pennacchietti S. Crepaldi T. Chiara F. Comoglio P.M. Antibody Immunoconj. Radiopharm. 1995; 8: 341-361Google Scholar). Since tumor malignancy depends on events such as the ability of cancer cells to undergo uncontrolled cell proliferation, loss of differentiation, acquisition of a motile and invasive phenotype, and induction of neovascularization, the untimely activation of the met receptor might give a strong contribution to the metastatic phenotype, as indicated by both experimental models (3Rong S.

We have recently reported that selection for liver-specific colonization in the B16 murine melanoma model system consistently correlates with an increased expression of constitutively active c-Met (7Rusciano D. Lorenzoni P. Burger M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1979-1987PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of the present study is to address mechanisms of constitutive c-Met activation in liver-specific B16-LS9 cells. This cell line has been derived after nine passages through the liver and has the highest level of c-Met expression and activation, with no detectable production of the cognate ligand (7Rusciano D. Lorenzoni P. Burger M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1979-1987PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of the Met tyrosine kinase domain, in the absence of its natural ligand, may occur as a consequence of at least three different mechanisms: 1) loss of the extracellular and transmembrane domains and fusion with a strong dimerization motif, such as in the oncogenic form of met, tpr-met (8Gonzatti-Haces M. Seth A. Park M. Copeland T. Oroszlan S. Vande Woude G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar); 2) defective post-translational processing, leading to the transport to the plasma membrane of an uncleaved form of 190 kDa (9Mondino A. Giordano S. Comoglio P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6084-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); and 3) amplification and overexpression of the proto-oncogenic form, as described in the gastric carcinoma cell line GTL-16 (10Ponzetto C. Giordano S. Peverali F. Della Valle G. Abate M.L. Vaula G. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 553-559PubMed Google Scholar). Since B16-LS9 cells produce a normally cleaved form of c-Met (7Rusciano D. Lorenzoni P. Burger M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1979-1987PubMed Google Scholar), the most likely explanation for its constitutive activation is the elevated density of receptor molecules on the cell surface, leading to their cross-phosphorylation and activation. In fact, we show here that the relative concentration of receptor molecules in different cell surface compartments has a strong influence on c-Met activation, which is high in dense, adherent monolayers, decreases in sparse monolayers, and almost disappears after cell detachment. Moreover, cell adhesion and density also affect cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase activity, which may be involved in regulating the activation state of c-Met. Results presented in this paper show for the first time in the same cell line the dramatic effects of both cell adhesion and density, plus the effects of temperature changes, on the activation state of a tyrosine kinase receptor, such as c-Met. B16-LS9 cells have been selected for liver-specific colonization from parental B16-F1 cells by means of repeated passages through the liver of syngeneic mice (11Rusciano D. Lorenzoni P. Burger M.M. Invasion & Metastasis. 1993; 13: 212-224PubMed Google Scholar). They were routinely grown in DMEM with 10% FCS in a humidified incubator at 37°C and periodically checked for mycoplasma infection. Cell extracts to be used for Western blot determination of c-Met and tyrosine phosphorylated proteins or for evaluation of tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities were prepared with either Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol), or with CHAPS lysis buffer (5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% (w/v) CHAPS, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 1 mM orthovanadate (omitted for tyrosine phosphatase assay) and protease inhibitors (25 µg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin from Sigma; 1 mM AEBSF from Calbiochem). After incubation of cells for 20 min at 4°C, extracts were clarified by centrifugation in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, and proteins were determined by the DC-Lowry assay (Bio-Rad). For Western immunoblot analysis, similar amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore Corp.), and treated with specific antibodies (anti-Met-peptide rabbit polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotech; anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) mouse monoclonal 4G10 was a kind gift of Kurt Ballmer, Friedrich Miescher Institute). Peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Dako Corp.) were detected by the luminol reaction (Amersham Corp.) on Hyperfilm (Amersham Corp.). B16 cells were put in suspension in DMEM with 10% FCS, rinsed twice in PBS, resuspended in cold PBS plus protease inhibitors as above, and sonicated on ice to break the cells. After removal of nuclei by low speed centrifugation, membranes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g and solubilized with CHAPS lysis buffer (without orthovanadate) for 30 min on ice. The extract, clarified by ultracentrifugation, and the postmembrane supernatant, taken as the cytosol fraction, were then used in the tyrosine phosphatase assay as described below. Cell extracts were prepared as described above from adherent cells plated at different densities as indicated in the figure legends or from cells in suspension. In the latter case, cells were detached from the dish by EDTA treatment, resuspended in complete DMEM, and incubated under different conditions, as described in the figure legends. After two rinses with PBS, the pellet was extracted in lysis buffer as above. Tyrosine kinase activity was assayed in triplicate samples by incorporation of 32P in an artificial substrate (polyglutamyl tyrosine 4:1, Sigma) as described (7Rusciano D. Lorenzoni P. Burger M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1979-1987PubMed Google Scholar). Specific incorporation on tyrosine was calculated after subtraction of blanks (with no polyglutamyl tyrosine added) and expressed as specific activity (femtomoles of phosphate/min/µg of protein). Alternatively, nonradioactive determination of tyrosine kinase or phosphatase activity was carried out with specific kits (Boehringer Mannheim), in which tyrosine phosphorylation of biotinylated synthetic peptides bound to an avidin-coated multiwell plate was detected by ELISA after being labeled with a peroxidated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. In this case, proteins from cell or membrane extracts or from cytosol were diluted in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.2 (tyrosine phosphatase assay), or 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4 (tyrosine kinase assay), containing bovine serum albumin (1.0 mg/ml), β-mercaptoethanol (0.1%), and orthovanadate (100 µM; only tyrosine kinase assay). Tyrosine phosphatase activity is expressed as (T0− Tn)/T0, where T0 is the optical reading of the control to which both proteins and an excess of orthovanadate were added and Tn is the optical reading at a certain time. 106 cells were plated onto 0.4-µm pore filters of 35-mm transwell chambers (Costar Corp.) in DMEM with 10% FCS. The next day 100 mg/ml biotin-NHS (biotinamidocaproate N-hydroxysuccinimide ester; Sigma B-2643) from a frozen stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide was diluted to 1 mg/ml in Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS, and then to 0.5 mg/ml in serum-free-DMEM. Apical or ventral surface labeling was achieved by adding 1.0 ml of biotin (0.5 mg/ml) to either the upper or the lower chamber of the transwell (whereas the opposite surface received the vehicle only) for 20 min at room temperature. After being rinsed three times with PBS, cells were extracted in CHAPS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and 1 mM orthovanadate for 20 min at 4°C as described above. Immunoprecipitation was performed at 4°C. Aliquots of 350 µg of proteins in 500 µl of CHAPS buffer were preadsorbed with protein A-Sepharose (Bio-Rad) for 30 min. The supernatant then received either anti-Met (Santa Cruz Biotech) or anti-Tyr(P) (mouse monoclonal 4G10) and anti-mouse IgG (Dako Corp.) for 2 h. Immunocomplexes were then precipitated with protein A-Sepharose for 30 min, rinsed three times with CHAPS buffer, and solubilized in reducing Laemmli's sample buffer for further SDS gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with avidin peroxidase (Sigma) to detect biotinylated surface proteins. We have recently reported that the B16-LS9 cell line, selected in vivo for liver-specific colonization (11Rusciano D. Lorenzoni P. Burger M.M. Invasion & Metastasis. 1993; 13: 212-224PubMed Google Scholar), expressed the c-met proto-oncogene at higher levels than the parental line B16-F1 and that as a consequence of its overexpression, c-Met was constitutively activated in B16-LS9 cells (7Rusciano D. Lorenzoni P. Burger M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1979-1987PubMed Google Scholar). Data presented in Fig. 1 show that the difference between LS9 and F1 in tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met and other proteins related to its kinase activity (7Rusciano D. Lorenzoni P. Burger M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1979-1987PubMed Google Scholar) is clearly visible only when cell extracts are prepared from adherent cells. On the contrary, in extracts obtained from cells incubated in suspension for 30 min, a dramatic decrease of tyrosine phosphorylation in both LS9 and F1 cells is detected, so that every difference has now disappeared (Fig. 1A, upper panel). Moreover, whereas the amount of c-Met in F1 cells does not seem to depend on their adhesion state, there is a net decrease in the amount of c-Met when LS9 cells are put in suspension (Fig. 1A, lower panel). When we measured the tyrosine kinase activity detectable in LS9 cells (which we have shown to be mostly dependent on c-Met; Ref. 7Rusciano D. Lorenzoni P. Burger M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1979-1987PubMed Google Scholar) we found that it is decreased upon cell detachment by an amount that is directly proportional to the estimated decrease in c-Met expression (29% decrease in activity and 33% decrease in expression) (Fig. 1B). In contrast, since c-Met contributes only a minor fraction of the tyrosine kinase activity detectable in F1 cell extracts (7Rusciano D. Lorenzoni P. Burger M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1979-1987PubMed Google Scholar), no major changes in tyrosine kinase activity are detectable in cell extracts prepared from F1 either adherent or in suspension (Fig. 1B). It is, however, interesting to observe that, in spite of a comparable absence of tyrosine phosphorylation in both LS9 and F1 cell suspension extracts (Fig. 1A, upper panel), the amount of c-Met (Fig. 1A, lower panel) and its kinase activity (Fig. 1B) were still higher in LS9 than in F1, suggesting that the decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation that follows detachment is not entirely due to the decrease of c-Met tyrosine kinase activity. Furthermore, we have found that in addition to the adhesion state of the cells, cell density can also influence c-Met activation and the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of adherent LS9 cells. At low cell density, both tyrosine phosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity are lower than at high cell density (Fig. 1, C and D). Cell size may decrease with increasing cell density, and we have in fact found 50% less protein per cell in cell extracts at high cell density. This finding has prompted us to analyze tyrosine phosphorylation in these extracts by comparing either similar amounts of proteins per lane (Fig. 1C, first two lanes) or different amounts of proteins derived from a similar number of cells (Fig. 1C, next two lanes). In both cases a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation at the lower density could be detected. Interestingly, when comparing similar amounts of proteins, an apparent increase (about 33%) of c-Met at high density could be observed, which, however, disappeared when comparing proteins derived from the same amount of cells (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). These data indicate that the amount of c-Met per cell remains constant at the different densities, whereas its ratio to the total amount of proteins in cell extracts decreases at decreasing densities, leading to a lowering of its concentration on the cell surface. The loss of tyrosine phosphorylation upon cell detachment appears to be a sudden event, independent of the method used for detachment (scraping in PBS shows the same effects; data not shown) and detectable as soon as LS9 cells are removed from the substrate (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, regaining tyrosine phosphorylation proceeds with slower kinetics, and little phosphorylation is achieved 30 min after replating, as compared to the normal phosphorylation pattern at 24 h (Fig. 2B). The decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation that follows cell detachment could be partially prevented by the addition to the cell suspension of a general inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatase activity, such as orthovanadate (1 mM) (Fig. 3A), suggesting the involvement of a tyrosine phosphatase activity in the observed loss of tyrosine phosphorylation. The presence, however, of two different concentrations (10 and 50 µM) of phenylarsine oxide (Fig. 3A), which has been reported to be more specific for the inhibition of membrane-bound, receptor-type tyrosine phosphatases (12Liao K. Hoffman R.D. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6544-6553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Garcia-Morales P. Minami Y. Luong E. Klausner R.D. Samelson L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9255-9259Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), was not able to restore tyrosine phosphorylation in cell suspension (Fig. 3A). In agreement with these observations, measurement of tyrosine phosphatase activity in cell extracts derived from either adherent or suspended cells showed an increase of activity upon cell detachment (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, similarly to what observed for the tyrosine kinase activity, the tyrosine phosphatase activity also increased with the cell density. A proportional further increase upon cell detachment could be observed at both densities (Fig. 3B). Finally, the tyrosine phosphatase activity was much higher in the cytosolic than in the particulate fraction derived from resuspended cells (Fig. 3C), ruling out the involvement of a membrane-bound receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase in the observed events. The dramatic reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation following cell detachment is also prevented by a temperature decrease to 4°C and appears to be fully reversible, since further shifts of temperature between 37 and 4°C of the cell suspension modified the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern as expected (Fig. 4A). One possible explanation for the recovery of tyrosine phosphorylation at 4°C is that the phosphatase activity is more inhibited than the kinase activity by a temperature decrease. However, when we measured the rate of inhibition of the two activities when the temperature was lowered to 4°C, we found the same amount of decrease for both the tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities (Fig. 4B). A similar rate of decrease, however, does not necessarily mean that the absolute amounts of kinase and phosphatase activities remaining at 4°C maintain the same balance as before. Therefore we also determined the kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of an artificial substrate at either room temperature or 4°C, in the absence of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate, so to measure the actual balance of the kinase and phosphatase activities at the two temperatures (Fig. 4C). Results indeed show that, whereas at room temperature the tyrosine phosphatase activity is prevalent, slowly leading to a loss of tyrosine phosphorylation, the opposite is true at 4°C. These results are further confirmed in the experiment illustrated in Fig. 4D. In this case, cell extracts from adherent cells have been prepared at either room temperature or 4°C, in the presence or in the absence of orthovanadate in the extraction buffer. When orthovanadate was present, and thus tyrosine phosphatase(s) inhibited, the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation was higher at room temperature than at 4°C, because tyrosine kinase activity was obviously more efficient at the higher temperature. When, however, orthovanadate was omitted in the extraction buffer, so that the effect of both tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities could be detected, the resulting tyrosine phosphorylation was higher at 4°C than at room temperature, indicating again that at the higher temperature the balance of activities was in favor of the tyrosine phosphatase, whereas the balance was inverted at the lower temperature. Since c-Met has been shown to be selectively exposed at the basolateral plasma membrane domain of polarized epithelial cells (14Crepaldi T. Pollack A.L. Prat M. Zborek A. Mostov K. Comoglio P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), an intriguing possibility was that in melanoma cells also, even though they are not polarized, the amount of c-Met on the ventral, adherent surface is higher than on the apical surface, creating different densities of receptor molecules in the two compartments, which in turn might influence constitutive activation and tyrosine phosphorylation. The distribution of c-Met on the cell surface of adherent LS9 cells was assessed by plating the cells on filters with pores of 0.4 µm, so that selective biotinylation of cell membrane proteins expressed on the ventral or the apical surface could be achieved by adding the biotin solution either in the lower or the upper chamber of the transwell (“Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 14Crepaldi T. Pollack A.L. Prat M. Zborek A. Mostov K. Comoglio P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cell extracts prepared after biotinylation were then immunoprecipitated with either anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-Met, and biotinylated proteins in the immunoprecipitate were detected on a Western blot by avidin peroxidase. The left panel of Fig. 5 reports a control showing that the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of LS9 cells plated on filters and labeled from either side is comparable to what expected in adherent cells. In the further evaluation of the results, it should, however, be considered that, as a consequence of the peculiar shape of an adherent cell, the surface available for biotinylation might be higher on the apical side than on the ventral side. In fact, the total amount of biotinylation detectable in the two cell extracts was much higher when biotin was added in the upper chamber (thus labeling the apical surface) than when biotin was added to the lower chamber (thus labeling that portion of the ventral surface that is accessible to the solution through filter pores) (Fig. 5A, first two lanes of the right panel). Therefore, for a correct quantitative evaluation of the results, the amount of biotinylated c-Met (β-subunit) revealed by avidin peroxidase after immunoprecipitation with either anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-Met (Fig. 5A, next four lanes of the right panel) must be normalized to the total amount of biotinylated proteins (Fig. 5B). Then, it becomes evident that a higher amount of c-Met is present on the ventral rather than on the apical surface and that most of this Met is activated (tyrosine phosphorylated), supporting the idea of an uneven distribution of c-Met on the cell surface, with a higher density and constitutive activity on the ventral side. Evidence has been presented in this paper that constitutive activation of c-Met in B16-LS9 cells may depend upon spontaneous dimerization and cross-phosphorylation of receptor molecules (in the absence of the specific ligand, which normally triggers this event) as a consequence of their density in the plasma membrane, as suggested for the GTL-16 cell line (10Ponzetto C. Giordano S. Peverali F. Della Valle G. Abate M.L. Vaula G. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 553-559PubMed Google Scholar). However, the level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in a cell is the result of the competing activities of both tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. We have already shown that the main tyrosine kinase activity detectable in B16-LS9 cells comes from the HGF/SF receptor, the product of the c-met proto-oncogene, which is constitutively active in these cells (7Rusciano D. Lorenzoni P. Burger M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1979-1987PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that a cytosolic enzyme accounts for most of the tyrosine phosphatase activity (Fig. 3C). The balance between these two activities appears to depend on conditions such as adherence to a substrate, compartmentalization of c-Met, cell density, and temperature. Upon cell removal from the substrate, there is a sudden loss of tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1A), which is not fully accounted for by the decrease in c-Met and its kinase activity (Fig. 1, A and B). Indeed, in spite of the fact that both c-Met expression and tyrosine kinase activity are still higher in B16-LS9 than in B16-F1 cells in suspension, the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation in cell extracts is now at comparable levels in the two lines. Activation of a tyrosine phosphatase after cell detachment might help to explain this observation. A similar event has been described in chick embryo fibroblasts, in which release from the substrate activated a tyrosine phosphatase activity associated with both the cytosolic and membrane fraction (15Maher P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11177-11181Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the case of LS9 cells, we clearly show that it is a cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase activity that is enhanced after cell detachment (Fig. 3C), and thus is a likely candidate for tyrosine phosphorylation control. However, unlike what described in the GTL-16 cell line (16Villa-Moruzzi E. Lapi S. Prat M. Gaudino G. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18176-18180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase here described is not found in association with c-Met (results not shown). Cell density, like what was reported in other systems, also had some relevance on tyrosine phosphorylation levels observed in adherent cells (Fig. 1C). Tyrosine phosphorylation and cellular distribution of the epidermal growth factor receptor in A431 human carcinoma cells are modulated by cell-cell contact (17Lichtner R.B. Schirrmacher V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 144: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, while in our system we report increased tyrosine phosphorylation with increasing density, the response of A431 cells to epidermal growth factor-induced phosphorylation was more pronounced at low density (17Lichtner R.B. Schirrmacher V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 144: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This observation is likely explained by an increase in a soluble tyrosine phosphatase activity in A431 cells grown as either dense monolayers or spheroid cultures (18Mansbridge J.N. Knuechel R. Knapp A.M. Sutherland R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Similarly, fibroblasts in which growth arrest was induced by confluence showed an elevation of a membrane-associated tyrosine phosphatase activity, which might represent a regulatory event in the control of cell proliferation caused by cell contact (19Pallen C.J. Tong P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6996-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To date, several receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatases have been described, the expression and/or activity of which is regulated by cell density and cell-cell contact (20Brady-Kalnay S.M. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We report here an increase of both the tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities with increasing cell density (Figs. 1D and 3B), unlike all the known systems. Therefore, the decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation observed at low density cannot be accounted for by a higher tyrosine phosphatase activity. Cell size, however, can be affected by cell density, and B16-LS9 cells appeared to be smaller at higher densities, whereas the amount of c-Met per cell remained stable (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the same amount of c-Met is distributed on the surface of cells of different size at different densities, thus attaining a concentration and activation that is higher in dense monolayers than in sparse monolayers. Expression of c-Met in adherent B16-LS9 cells appears to occur predominantly on the ventral surface (Fig. 5). It is known that some growth factor receptors are expressed at the basolateral surface in polarized epithelial cells, as shown for c-Met itself (14Crepaldi T. Pollack A.L. Prat M. Zborek A. Mostov K. Comoglio P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and for the epidermal growth factor receptor both in vitro (21Maratos-Flier E. Kao C.-Y.Y. Verdin E.M. King G.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1595-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and in vivo (22Bossert N.L. Nelson K.G. Ross K.A. Takahashi T. McLachlan J. Dev. Biol. 1990; 142: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, polarization of epithelial cells requires cell adhesion to a substrate and is rapidly lost upon detachment (23Mauchamp J. Chambard M. Verrier B. Gabrion J. Chabaud O. Gerard C. Penel C. Pialat B. Anfosso F. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1987; 8: 345-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Drubin D.G. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 335-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Compartmentalization of c-Met on the ventral surface may help explain observations such as the dependence of c-Met constitutive activation on cell density and receptor concentration on the membrane, loss of activation after cell detachment, and the ability of B16-LS9 cells to further respond to HGF/SF stimulation (7Rusciano D. Lorenzoni P. Burger M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1979-1987PubMed Google Scholar), in spite of the presence of a constitutive activated receptor. In fact, increased c-Met expression (and therefore concentration) on the ventral, adherent surface of melanoma cells might account for the most part of constitutive activation. Receptor molecules expressed at the apical surface would be available for ligand binding and further triggering of the motility (7Rusciano D. Lorenzoni P. Burger M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1979-1987PubMed Google Scholar) and growth (not shown) responses. Upon cell detachment, compartmentalization is lost, and receptor molecules become homogeneously distributed on the cell surface, leading to a decrease in their relative concentration and a consequent decrease of their constitutive activation. In conclusion, we have presented evidence indicating that constitutive c-Met activation in B16-LS9 cells depends on overexpression and density of receptor molecules on the cell surface. This density is reduced in subconfluent cell cultures, resulting in a decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of c-Met. Compartmentalization of c-Met on the ventral surface of adherent B16-LS9 cells locally increases the density of receptor molecules, leading to a more efficient dimerization and cross-phosphorylation. This favorable distribution is lost upon cell detachment, which results both in an absolute decrease of c-Met on the cell surface and in a reduced density on the membrane. Moreover, a soluble tyrosine phosphatase activity becomes more active when B16-LS9 cells are released from the substrate. The combination of these two events leads to a dramatic decrease of tyrosine phosphorylation in B16-LS9 cells in suspension. This decrease can be partially prevented by orthovanadate (but not by phenylarsine oxide) and fully prevented by low temperatures (Fig. 4), which appear to shift the balance between tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities much more in favor of the former. Progression of different tumor types toward a more malignant phenotype has been linked in many cases to overexpression of c-Met (5Di Renzo M.F. Olivero M. Giacomini A. Porte H. Chastre E. Mirossay L.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1129-1138PubMed Google Scholar), which may thus become constitutively activated, and confer a higher responsiveness to HGF/SF, as we have shown in the case of B16-LS9 cells (7Rusciano D. Lorenzoni P. Burger M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1979-1987PubMed Google Scholar). However, results presented in this paper indicate that even high levels of overexpression are not a necessary and sufficient condition for c-Met constitutive activation, and other factors, such as adhesion and density, may strongly influence the delicate balance between tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities, which finally result in the activation state of c-Met. Adhesion is also a critical event in the process of cancer metastasis that may affect targeting, invasion, and growth of malignant cells. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the activation state of c-Met may depend on the specific ability of different organ environments to support adhesion (leading to c-Met compartmentalization and a decrease in tyrosine phosphatase activity) and further growth (enhancing c-Met density on the cell surface) of metastatic cells. As a consequence, more c-Met may become constitutively activated at those sites where malignant cells adhere and grow efficiently, starting a positive feedback, since c-Met itself may contribute to the malignant phenotype.

Treatment of mammalian cells with genotoxic agents causes an increase in the mRNA levels of a number of “damage response” genes (reviewed by Holbrook and Fornace (1Holbrook N.J. Fornace A.J. New Biol. 1991; 3: 825-833PubMed Google Scholar)). Many of these genes are also inducible by phorbol ester treatment. Among those that do not respond to phorbol ester treatment, some can be activated by the tumor suppressor gene p53, such as WAF1 and GADD45 (2El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B.

However, there are also a number of DNA damage-inducible genes for which the activation signal is unknown, and GADD153 is one of these genes. GADD153 is of particular interest because the magnitude of the increase in its mRNA following cellular injury is greater than most other “damage response” genes. GADD153 was originally cloned by subtractive hybridization of UV-treated versus proliferating Chinese hamster ovary cells. It was one of a subset of genes that was induced by UV-radiation and other forms of DNA damage but not by heatshock or phorbol ester treatment (4Fornace A.J. Alamo I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). This subset of genes was found to be coordinately regulated by a number of agents that damage DNA or induce cell cycle arrest (5Fornace Jr., A.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The human homolog has now been cloned and localized to the 12q13.1-q13.2 region on chromosome 12 (6Park J.S. Luethy J.D. Wang M.G. Fargnoli J. Fornace A.J. McBride O.W. Holbrook N.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This gene is highly conserved, with the human gene showing 78% nucleotide identity with the hamster gene. The role of the GADD153 gene product has not been well defined, but there is some evidence that it plays a role in cell cycle control during the cellular injury response. When transfected into cells under the control of a constitutively active promoter, GADD153 expression blocks the ability of human ovarian carcinoma cells to proliferate and form colonies. 1D. P. Gately, unpublished data. Zhan et al. (7Zhan Q. Lord K.A. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Fornace A.J. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) microinjected an expression vector containing the GADD153 coding region or purified GADD153 protein into cells. Both the plasmid and the purified protein prevented the cells from exiting G1 and entering the next S phase, as measured by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. These results argue that the GADD153 gene product may be involved in cellular machinery that causes arrest at the G1-S boundary after DNA damage or other kinds of cellular injury. We have previously demonstrated in cell lines and xenografts that the magnitude of the increase in GADD153 message is closely linked to the extent of cellular injury caused by the chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel, and that these two agents transcriptionally activate the GADD153 promoter via different signal transduction pathways (9Gately D.P. Sharma A. Christen R.D. Howell S.B. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 73: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As an initial step toward defining these pathways in more detail, we have dissected the GADD153 promoter to identify the components essential to the transcriptional activation produced by paclitaxel. We report here the identification and initial characterization of a cellular injury response element (CIRE) 2The abbreviations used are: CIREcellular injury response elementLUCluciferasePCRpolymerase chain reactionTBPTATA-binding proteinTAFTBP-associated factor. that is required for the paclitaxel activation of the GADD153 promoter. cellular injury response element luciferase polymerase chain reaction TATA-binding protein TBP-associated factor.

J. Holbrook, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD) containing the hamster GADD153 promoter into the AccI/HindIII site of pB-LUC (11Luethy J.D. Holbrook N.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5-10PubMed Google Scholar). pB-LUC contains the firefly luciferase gene ligated into the BamHI site of pBluescript KS− (a gift of Dr. Linda Quattrochi). Deletion mutations were made using a PCR-based strategy. Primers containing XhoI linkers and an antisense primer within the multicloning region of pBluescript were used to generate deletion fragments of the promoter. These fragments were cut with XhoI and HindIII and ligated into the XhoI/HindIII sites of pB-LUC. Mutations in the Sp1 binding site were made by substituting TCC for TCC (underlined text, Sp1 binding site; boldface text, mutated bases) at position −59 relative to the start of transcription. Linker scanning mutations were made using primers containing the Sp1 mutation (as above) or a 3′ mutation (substituting G for G (boldface text, mutated bases) at position −51 relative to the start of transcription) in both the sense and antisense orientation. Fragments were made from the mutation to the pBluescript cloning region and from the mutation to −185 (with XhoI linker) relative to the start of transcription. These fragments were mixed and used as template for a reaction with primers from −185 (with XhoI linker) to the pBluescript cloning region. These fragments were cut with XhoI and HindIII and ligated into the XhoI/HindIII sites of pB-LUC. The cells were transfected with the pGADD-LUC construct by a modification of the method described by Rose et al. (12Rose J.K. Buonocore L. Whitt M.A. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 520-525PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 3 × 105 cells per 35-mm dish, and then 18 h later, they were incubated at 37°C with 5 µg plasmid DNA and 30 µl liposomes in 1 ml RPMI 1640. After 3 h, the lipids were removed, and the cells were treated with paclitaxel for 24 h. The cells were lysed in 100-500 µl of lysis buffer (25 mM glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mM MgSO4, 4 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM dithiothreitol). Luciferase activity was measured by a modification of the method described by Brasier et al. (13Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar). Fifty µl of cell lysate were added to 200 µl of reaction buffer (lysis buffer with 15 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, and 2 mM ATP added). Light emission was measured after injection of 100 µl of 1 mM luciferin into the lysate/reaction mixture using a MonoLight 2001 (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego, CA). Nuclear extracts were made by pelleting 108 cells and resuspending in buffer A (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol). Cells were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min on ice and were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g. Cells were lysed in buffer B (buffer A with 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin) for 10 min on ice. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 × g. Nuclei were suspended in buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin) and then lysed by bringing the final KCl concentration to 0.4 M, with rocking for 30 min at 4°C. Genomic DNA was pelleted by centrifugation for 40 min at 65,000 rpm (175,000 × g) in a Beckman tabletop ultracentrifuge. The supernatant containing the nuclear proteins was recovered, and glycerol was added to a final concentration of 40%. Sp1 was immunodepleted from extracts by incubation for 1 h at 4°C with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against amino acids 520-538 of the human Sp1 protein (PEP2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The lysate was cleared using protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). A fragment of DNA corresponding to bases −185 to +21 relative to the start of transcription was generated by PCR. The fragment was cut with either XhoI or EcoRV to remove one of the primers, and the DNA was 32P-labeled on a single strand by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI), precipitated to remove unincorporated nucleotide, and resuspended. Ten µg of nuclear extract, two footprinting units of purified Sp1 (Promega), or no protein controls were diluted to 25 µl with buffer Z (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 10 µM ZnSO4, 20% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Twenty-five µl of a solution containing 10 µl of 10% polyvinyl alcohol (Sigma), 1 mg poly(dI-dC), and ≥10,000 cpm (10-25 fmol) of labeled DNA was added to the protein mixture and incubated 15 min at room temperature. Fifty µl of 5 mM CaCl2/10 MgCl2 mix was added and incubated for 1 min. Two µl of DNase I (Sigma; 10 mg/ml; dilutions ranging from 1:2,000 to 1:100,000) was then added and incubated for another minute. The reaction was stopped by adding 90 µl of stop solution (20 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 0.2 M NaCl, and 250 µg/ml glycogen). Proteins were digested with 5 µl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K and removed by phenol extraction. The DNA was precipitated and resuspended in 3 µl of formamide loading buffer. The bands were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide/urea sequencing gel, dried, and exposed to Biomax MS film. Sequencing was done with the Promega fmol sequencing kit (Promega) using the protocol for end-labeled primers. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the CIRE were constructed at the University of California, San Diego Molecular Biology Core facility, and annealed together by heating for 5 min at 65°C and incubating overnight at 37°C in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 0.1 M NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA. The double-stranded CIRE (or Sp1-mutated CIRE) was precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in H2O, and 32P end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega), precipitated to remove unincorporated nucleotide, and resuspended to 500 pg/µl (∼50,000 cpm/µl). Fifty thousand cpm of the CIRE, 1 µg of poly(dI-dC), 10 µg of nuclear extract, or two footprinting units of human Sp1 protein (Promega) were suspended in 12.5 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 50 mM KCl, 6.25 mM MgCl2, 5 µM ZnSO4, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The bands were separated on a 4% polyacrylamide/0.5 × TBE (45 mM Tris borate and 10 mM EDTA) gel, dried, and visualized using the Molecular Imager System (Bio-Rad). Supershift assays were performed as above with the addition of 0.05 µg of anti-Sp1 antibody (PEP2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or nonspecific rabbit antibody (anti-tubulin; Sigma) to the reaction mixture after the 30-min incubation and incubating for an additional 30 min. Total cellular RNA was extracted, and Northern blots prepared using MagnaGraph nylon membranes (MSI, Westboro, MA) by standard techniques (14Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co. Inc., New York1986: 129Google Scholar). The extent of hybridization was quantitated by the Molecular Imager System (Bio-Rad). The human GADD153 probe was a gift of Dr. N. J. Holbrook (National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD). Lane loading differences were corrected for by comparison to the same blot hybridized with a β-actin probe. The effect of paclitaxel on the GADD153 promoter-driven luciferase construct and endogenous GADD153 mRNA was studied in the 2008 ovarian carcinoma cell line. Cells were transfected with 5 µg of pGADD-LUC and then exposed to paclitaxel for 24 h, at which point luciferase activity and endogenous GADD153 mRNA levels were determined. As shown in Fig. 1, paclitaxel induced a concentration-dependent increase in both GADD153 promoter activity and endogenous GADD153 message level that were of the same order of magnitude. Deletions in the GADD153 promoter were created by PCR and are shown in Fig. 2. These constructs were transfected into 2008 cells and tested for inducibility following exposure to 70 nM paclitaxel relative to cells treated with vehicle alone. Deletions from −786 to −85 relative to the start of transcription had no significant effect on the activation of the GADD153 promoter by paclitaxel. Deletion to −74 base pairs increased the inducibility almost 2-fold, suggesting that the 11 bases 5′ of −74 contain a transcriptional repressor. Further deletion of the promoter to −35 bases (leaving only the TATA box) decreased the paclitaxel inducibility to 2.2-fold. This suggests that the 39 base pairs from −74 to the TATA box contain an element that is responsible for the paclitaxel-induced increase in GADD153 promoter activity. The finding that the construct containing only the TATA box is activated 2-fold suggests that paclitaxel-induced injury has a slight positive effect on the basal transcription machinery. To determine whether this 39-base pair sequence from −74 bases to the TATA box was sufficient to confer paclitaxel responsiveness to another promoter, we transferred these bases into a promoter containing the adenovirus E4-TATA region. The relative position of these 39 bases and the TATA box was kept constant. As shown in Fig. 3, the 39 bases conferred paclitaxel inducibility on the E4-TATA region, and the magnitude of induction was similar to that produced by the −74 GADD-LUC construct. We have identified this 39-base pair region as a CIRE. The CIRE region from −74 to −35 contains only one known transcription factor recognition sequence, an Sp1 binding site. We mutated this site from CCCGCCCC to CCTAGACC using a PCR-based system and assayed the activity of this construct. As shown at the bottom of Fig. 2, this mutation decreased the ability of paclitaxel to activate the promoter from 20.0- to 5.3-fold, indicating that the Sp1 site is a necessary part of the sequence that confers paclitaxel sensitivity. Since the Sp1 site appears to be required for the maximal paclitaxel-induced increase in promoter activity, we wished to determine whether paclitaxel activates all promoters that contained Sp1 sites. We explored this using the SV40 immediate-early promoter that contains five functional Sp1 sites and the cytochrome p450 CYP1A1 promoter, which also contains five Sp1 sites (15Postlind H. Vu T.P. Tukey R.H. Quattrochi L.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 118: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, paclitaxel increased the promoter activity in these constructs only 2-fold, which is the same increase as was observed in promoters containing only a TATA box. This indicates that although an Sp1 site is required for paclitaxel activation, it is not sufficient, or that the exact positioning of the Sp1 site relative to the TATA box is crucial. DNase I protection assays were performed to determine which bases of the CIRE are involved in the response to paclitaxel. The GADD153 promoter region from −185 to +21 bases relative to the start of transcription was 32P end-labeled and incubated with buffer alone or with two footprinting units of purified Sp1 protein, 10 µg of nuclear extract from untreated cells, or 10 µg of nuclear extract from cells treated with 70 nM paclitaxel for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 5, the pure Sp1 and nuclear extracts from both untreated and treated cells protected the same region from −62 to −48 bases on the noncoding strand. The nuclear extracts protected from −74 to −53 on the coding strand; purified Sp1 had a similar pattern of protection, protecting bases −71 to −53. The region protected on both strands includes the Sp1 site, which starts at −61 bases. These data suggest that Sp1, a protein complex that contains Sp1, or a protein that has the same binding characteristics as Sp1 is constitutively bound to the CIRE. To determine whether the sites protected in the DNase protection assay are required for paclitaxel activation of the GADD153 promoter or simply protected in a nonspecific manner, we mutated the Sp1 site and the protected bases directly 3′ of the Sp1 site using a linker scanning method. The sequence of the CIRE and the mutations constructed are shown in the top panel of Fig. 6. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 6, mutations in the Sp1 site decreased the inducibility of the construct to that of −35 pGADD-LUC, which contains only the TATA box. Mutation of the site directly 3′ of the Sp1 site had no significant effect on the activation of the promoter by paclitaxel. Although the magnitude of the induction of the −185 Sp1 mutant is somewhat less than that observed for the −74 Sp1 mutant (Fig. 2), it should be noted that the −185 Sp1 mutant contains the putative negative regulatory element between −85 and −74. The presence of this element and possible differences in tertiary structure of the constructs may account for the observed difference in activation after paclitaxel treatment. These data indicate that the Sp1 site, but not the protected site directly 3′ of the Sp1 site, is required for activation of the GADD153 promoter by paclitaxel. To further investigate the interaction between the CIRE and nuclear proteins from untreated and paclitaxel-treated cells, we performed gel mobility shift assays. Nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled CIRE and separated on a 0.5 × TBE/4% polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig. 7, 5 and 10 µg of nuclear extracts from untreated or paclitaxel-treated cells shifted the CIRE to the same extent as purified Sp1 protein (labeled I, lanes 2-6). However, no shift was observed when the proteins were incubated with a CIRE in which the Sp1 site had been mutated (Fig. 7, lanes 7-11). A nonspecific band of lower apparent molecular weight was observed when nuclear extracts were incubated with both the CIRE and the Sp1-mutant CIRE (labeled A in Fig. 7, Fig. 8). This result indicates that the binding of the protein responsible for the gel shift of the CIRE is dependent upon the presence of functional Sp1 site within the CIRE.Fig. 8Sp1 supershift and gel mobility shift assays of the CIRE using nuclear extracts immunodepleted of Sp1. The CIRE was end-labeled with 32P as above and incubated with no protein (lanes 1 and 2), nuclear extract from untreated cells (lanes 3 and 4), or nuclear extract from paclitaxel-treated cells (lanes 5 and 6), and with rabbit α-tubulin (lanes 1, 3, and 5) or rabbit α-Sp1 antibody (lanes 2, 4, and 6). The CIRE was also incubated with mock-depleted nuclear extract (lane 7) and Sp1-depleted nuclear extract (lane 8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the shift in apparent molecular mass was dependent upon a functional Sp1 site, we sought to determine whether Sp1 was bound to the CIRE after incubation with nuclear extract. As shown in Fig. 8, co-incubation of the nuclear extract-exposed CIRE with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against amino acids 520-538 of human Sp1 protein (PEP2) caused a supershift and increased the apparent molecular weight of the shifted complex (labeled II, lanes 4 and 6), whereas rabbit anti-β-tubulin antibody (Sigma) had no effect on the mobility of the complex (labeled I, lanes 3 and 5). This indicates that Sp1 protein is part of the complex that shifts the CIRE. To determine whether Sp1 protein is required for the formation of the complex that shifts the CIRE, Sp1 was immunodepleted from the nuclear extract with the PEP2 anti-Sp1 antibody. The mock-depleted extract shifted the CIRE to the same extent as the untreated nuclear extract (Fig. 8, lane 7); however, immunodepletion of Sp1 abolished the shift (Fig. 8, lane 8). Thus, Sp1 protein is required for formation of the complex that shifts the CIRE. However, Western blot analysis of 2008 whole-cell lysates 24 h after treatment with 70 nM paclitaxel demonstrated no change in Sp1 levels or mobility, suggesting that activation of the promoter is mediated by an event other than a change in Sp1 protein levels. 3D. P. Gately and S. B. Howell, unpublished data. The data presented in this report demonstrate that treatment of human ovarian carcinoma cells with the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel activates the GADD153 promoter through an element no larger than 39 bases positioned immediately 5′ of the TATA box that we have identified as a CIRE. Three lines of evidence establish that the CIRE is necessary and sufficient for transcription activation of this promoter: 1) deletion of the CIRE eliminates the ability of paclitaxel to activate the GADD153 promoter above the level observed with a promoter containing only the TATA box; 2) mutation of the key Sp1 site within this element inhibits the ability of paclitaxel to activate the promoter; and 3) transfer of this element to a position 5′ of a heterologous promoter confers paclitaxel inducibility. Work by Sylvester et al. (16Sylvester S.L. Rhys C.M.J. Leuthy-Martindale J.D. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20119-20125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that transcriptional activation of the GADD153 promoter after treatment with lipopolysaccharide required the binding of transcription factors to the C/EBP element present in the promoter at −332 to −323 bases relative to the start of transcription (16Sylvester S.L. Rhys C.M.J. Leuthy-Martindale J.D. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20119-20125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this element does not appear to be involved in the cellular response to paclitaxel. These data are consistent with our previous work and reports by others, showing that induction of GADD153 can be mediated by several pathways that differ depending on the type of growth-inhibitory stimulus (9Gately D.P. Sharma A. Christen R.D. Howell S.B. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 73: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Jackman J. Alamo I. Fornace A.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5656-5662PubMed Google Scholar). The CIRE that mediates transcriptional activation by paclitaxel contains an Sp1 consensus sequence (CCCGCC) at −61 bases relative to the start of transcription. As shown most cogently by the linker scanning mutations, this site is required for activation of the promoter by paclitaxel, whereas the three other Sp1 sites further 5′ in this promoter apparently are not required and cannot substitute for the Sp1 site in the CIRE. The specificity of the Sp1 site in the CIRE is further demonstrated by the fact that paclitaxel does not activate the SV40 early promoter, demonstrating that Sp1 sites alone are not sufficient for full activation. The results reported here provide strong evidence that Sp1 or a very closely related protein is required for the activation of the GADD153 promoter by paclitaxel. In DNase I protection assays, the footprint of purified Sp1 was similar to that of the nuclear extract in that region of the promoter. A protein or proteins present in the nuclear extract bound to the CIRE and shifted the DNA to the same extent as purified Sp1 protein but did not shift the CIRE containing a mutation in the Sp1 site. An antibody specific for Sp1 supershifted the nuclear extract·CIRE complex, indicating that Sp1 is part of the complex. Sp1 is required for this binding since immunodepletion of Sp1 from the nuclear extract abolished the gel shift. These experiments very strongly suggest that Sp1 is the protein that binds to the CIRE. There is a small possibility that a protein which cross-reacts with the Sp1 antibody is the protein that binds to the CIRE. Recent evidence suggests that there is a family of proteins that can bind to the Sp1 consensus site (18Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 20Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 21Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Sucke G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar); however, the fact that the PEP2 anti-Sp1 antibody is highly specific and does not cross-react with other family members makes it unlikely that another known member of the family is involved. Although Sp1 was originally thought to be a ubiquitous transcription factor involved solely in the constitutive expression of genes (22Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), recent evidence suggests that Sp1 is critical for regulated expression in some situations. Sp1 can act in concert with cell type-specific proteins to achieve tissue-specific expression (23Yieh L. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6102-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Borellini F. Aquino A. Josephs S.F. Glazer R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5541-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Borellini F. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7923-7928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, linker scanning mutations of the myeloid integrin CD11b promoter demonstrated that mutation of the Sp1 site abolished myeloid-specific promoter activity (26Chen H.-M. Pahl H.L. Scheibe R.J. Zhang D.-E. Tenen D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8230-8239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Zhang D.-E. Hetherington C.J. Tan S. Dziennis S.E. Gonzalez D.A. Chen H.-M. Tenen D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11425-11434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there are now several examples of transcriptional activation of promoters where Sp1 is an essential component but, nevertheless, is involved in regulated rather than constitutive expression. Despite the evidence that the Sp1 binding site in the CIRE is essential for paclitaxel-induced activation of the GADD153 promoter, we found that paclitaxel did not produce a change in apparent Sp1 binding to this consensus sequence, nor in Sp1 protein levels or mobility as measured by Western blot analysis. This suggests that changes in Sp1 protein levels are not responsible for GADD153 promoter activation after paclitaxel treatment. Sp1 was present in complexes formed with the CIRE by nuclear extracts from both untreated and paclitaxel-exposed cells, and a footprint consistent with Sp1 was produced in in vitro DNase I protection by nuclear extracts from both types of cells. Other Sp1-dependent inducible systems show this type of constitutive binding. The retinoblastoma protein regulates the expression of a number of genes including c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, insulin-like growth factor II, and transforming growth factor β1 through a retinoblastoma control element (28Kim S.-J. Onwuta U.S. Lee Y.I. Li R. Botchan M.R. Robbins P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 29Chen L.I. Nishinaka T. Kwan K. Kitabayashi I. Yokoyama K. Fu Y.-H.K. Grünwald S. Chiu R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4380-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Sp1 protein binds to the retinoblastoma control element constitutively in the insulin-like growth factor II and the c-jun promoters (28Kim S.-J. Onwuta U.S. Lee Y.I. Li R. Botchan M.R. Robbins P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 29Chen L.I. Nishinaka T. Kwan K. Kitabayashi I. Yokoyama K. Fu Y.-H.K. Grünwald S. Chiu R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4380-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The amount of this binding is increased in the c-jun promoter in response to retinoblastoma expression, possibly through the interaction of RB protein and an inhibitor of Sp1 binding (Sp1-I) (29Chen L.I. Nishinaka T. Kwan K. Kitabayashi I. Yokoyama K. Fu Y.-H.K. Grünwald S. Chiu R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4380-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), but no change in binding of Sp1 as measured by gel shift or DNase I footprinting was observed in the insulin-like growth factor II promoter following retinoblastoma expression (28Kim S.-J. Onwuta U.S. Lee Y.I. Li R. Botchan M.R. Robbins P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Apparently, in the case of the GADD153 promoter, formation of the complex for which the Sp1 site is essential and which contains Sp1 is not by itself sufficient for activation of the promoter, suggesting that activation requires additional events, such as phosphorylation of either Sp1 itself or one of the TAFs with which it associates. Recent data suggest that paclitaxel can activate a number of protein kinases (30Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4507-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 31Liu Y. Bhalla K. Hill C. Priest D.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32Ding A.H. Porteu F. Sanchez E. Nathan C.F. Science. 1990; 248: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 33Manthey C.L. Brandes M.E. Perera P.Y. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2459-2465PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of one or many of these kinases that could be responsible for the activation of transcription from Sp1 constitutively bound to DNA. There is evidence that phosphorylation of Sp1 can, in fact, alter its transcriptional activity. Okadaic acid stimulates the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat through Sp1 sites, yet the binding characteristics of Sp1 to the promoter are unchanged (34Vlach J. Garcia A. Jacqué J.-M. Rodriguez M.S. Michelson S. Virelizier J.-L. Virology. 1995; 208: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Using Western blotting, it was observed that okadaic acid treatment resulted in the complete conversion of Sp1 from the hypophosphorylated state (95 kDa) to the hyperphosphorylated state (105 kDa). To determine whether Sp1 phosphorylation induced changes in the interaction with TBP or TBP-associated proteins (TAFs), the TATA box was exchanged with a non-TBP binding TATA box. This change strongly decreased the inducibility by okadaic acid. Vlach et al. postulated that phosphorylation of Sp1 increases interaction with TBP or TAFs, which results in increased transcriptional activity. We postulate that Sp1 is constitutively bound to the Sp1 site at −61 bases relative to the start of transcription, and that after paclitaxel treatment, a posttranslation modification occurs that allows the Sp1 to activate transcription. Since we found that 24-h treatment with 70 nM paclitaxel had no significant effect upon Sp1 protein levels nor on the phosphorylation-dependent electrophoretic mobility of Sp1, it is likely that if phosphorylation is involved, it is either one of the TAFs that is the essential target or that activation is the result of a change in the distribution of phosphorylated sites within Sp1 that does not change the electrophoretic mobility of Sp1. This change in phosphorylation would allow a TAF that interacts with Sp1, such as TAFII110 (35Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), to bind to both Sp1 and the TATA-binding protein and initiate transcription. An alternative explanation is that paclitaxel treatment has no effect on Sp1 protein but modifies TAFII110 or another of the TAFs in such a way that they can bind to Sp1 and TBP and increase transcription. As with other observations suggesting that Sp1 can act as a transcription factor for inducible genes, we do not know why transcriptional activation can occur from one Sp1 site but not from other Sp1 sites in the same promoter. Our results argue that the Sp1 site at −61 in the GADD153 promoter has some special features the elucidation of which will help solve this puzzle. We thank Dr. N. J. Holbrook for providing the p9000 plasmid and Dr. L. Quattrochi for providing pB-LUC from which the pGADD-LUC construct was made, Dr. R.

https://openalex.org/W2045179462,"We have previously demonstrated enhanced transcriptional activity of the human Pi class glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase (<i>GSTP1</i>) promoter in a multidrug-resistant derivative (VCREMS) of the human mammary carcinoma cell line, MCF7 (Moffat, G. J., McLaren, A. W., and Wolf, C. R. (1994) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 269, 16397-16402). Furthermore, we have identified an essential sequence (C1; −70 to −59) within the <i>GSTP1</i> promoter that bound a Jun-Fos heterodimer in VCREMS but not in MCF7 cells. These present studies have examined the negative regulatory element (−105 to −86), which acted to suppress <i>GSTP1</i> transcription in MCF7 cells. Mutational analysis of this silencer element further defined the repressor binding site to be located between nucleotides −97 and −90. <i>In vitro</i> DNA binding assays suggested that the repressor exerted its action by causing displacement of the essential non-AP-1-like MCF7 C1 complex. However, the addition of MCF7 nuclear extract did not disrupt binding of the VCREMS Jun-Fos C1 complex to the <i>GSTP1</i> promoter. Furthermore, upstream insertion of the <i>GSTP1</i> silencer element failed to inhibit activity of a heterologous promoter in MCF7 cells. These results highlighted the cell and promoter specificity of the <i>GSTP1</i> transcriptional repressor and implicated a functional requirement for contact between the repressor and C1 complex. In this regard, the introduction of half-helical turns between the silencer and the C1 element abrogated repressor activity, thus leading to the hypothesis that a direct interaction between the repressor and C1 complex was required to suppress <i>GSTP1</i> transcription. Moreover, these findings suggest that cell-specific differences in the composition of the C1 nuclear complex may dictate repressor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2101325481,"Abstract A haloenol lactone derivative has been synthesized and found to be an isozyme-selective and active site-directed inactivator of glutathione S-transferase (GST). Preincubation of the haloenol lactone (100 μM) with murine Alpha, Mu, or Pi GST isozyme (1.0 μM) at pH 6.5, 37°C resulted in time-dependent loss of enzyme activity with highly selective inhibition of the Pi isozyme (t1/2, ∼ 2 min). In a separate experiment, a 10-fold excess of the lactone was incubated with GST-Pi isozyme at 37°C for 3 h, followed by dialysis against Nanopure water. GST activity lost upon incubation with the lactone could not be restored by exhaustive dialysis, and only 8% of enzyme activity for the modified GST remained relative to the control that was treated identically except the lactone was omitted from the incubation. Both control and modified GST were characterized using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. No native GST (23,478 Da) was observed in the spectrum of modified GST. Instead, protein incubated with the lactone exhibited an increase in molecular mass of 230 Da relative to control GST. The lactone (100 μM) was incubated with GST Pi isozyme (1.0 μM) in the presence of the competitive inhibitor S-hexylglutathione (10 μM), which suppressed time-dependent inhibition of GST by the lactone. The results suggest that this haloenol lactone is an irreversible and active site-directed inhibitor of GST that appears to inhibit the enzyme through two consecutive steps of nucleophilic attack."

INTRODUCTIONElongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) 1The abbreviations used are: EFelongation factoraa-tRNAaminoacyl-tRNAG-proteinguanine nucleotide-binding proteinGDPNPguanine 5′-(β,γ-imidotriphosphate)DTTdithiothreitol. is a key enzyme in protein biosynthesis. In its active conformation with GTP as a cofactor, it carries aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) to the A-site of the programmed ribosome in the process of decoding mRNA (1Miller D.L. Weissbach H. Weissbach H. Petska S. Molecular Mechanisms of Protein Biosynthesis. Academic Press, New York1977: 323Crossref Google Scholar). The complex of EF-Tu, GTP, and aa-tRNA has been denoted the ternary complex. During peptide bond formation GTP is hydrolyzed and EF-Tu adopts its inactive conformation, which has a negligible affinity for aa-tRNA. Nucleotide exchange factor EF-Ts catalyzes the replacement of GDP with GTP thereby completing the cycle. EF-Tu-dependent GTP hydrolysis is a rate-limiting step in protein biosynthesis and consequently is considered to be a step for proofreading of mRNA. The ribosome and aa-tRNA act as stimulating effectors of the GTPase activity at this crucial step. In Escherichia coli peptide bond formation proceeds at a rate of 10-20 bonds/s/ribosome (2Kennell D. Riezman H. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).E. coli EF-Tu is a monomeric protein consisting of 393 amino acid residues and with a molecular mass of 43.2 kDa. The nucleotide sequences of the two EF-Tu encoding genes tufA and tufB have been determined (3Yokota T. Sugisaki H. Takanami M. Kaziro Y. Gene (Amst.). 1980; 12: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4An G. Friesen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 1980; 12: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and so has the amino acid sequence of EF-Tu (5Jones M.D. Petersen T.E. Nielsen K.M. Magnusson S. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gausing K. Clark B.F.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 108: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The two genes differ only in 13 nucleotide positions, and the two gene products are identical except for the C-terminal position, which is a glycine in the tufA gene product and a serine in the tufB product. The existence of two almost identical genes encoding EF-Tu has been suggested to be part of a complicated bioregulatory mechanism (6Bosch L. Kraal B. van der Meide P.H. Duisterwinkel F.J. van Noort J.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 30: 91-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).EF-Tu is a member of the guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins), which include the Ras superfamily and the heterotrimeric G-proteins (7Kaziro Y. Hiroshio I. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The G-proteins all possess a G-domain and consequently the capability to cycle between a GTP-bound “on-state” and a GDP-bound “off-state.” The G-domain has thus been described as a molecular switch (8Woolley P.

The structure of the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein, Gi1, has been solved in complex with GTP and a transition state analogue (18Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.E. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar).For representatives of the three main groups of G-proteins, where both the active and inactive conformations are known, EF-Tu, p21ras, and transducin, there seems to be a distinct mechanism for the conformational change from the GTP to the GDP conformation. Nevertheless, for all three proteins one of the major structural changes involves the helix following the second nucleotide interacting loop. In EF-Tu this helix is named helix B.Helix B is flanked by two strictly conserved glycines in the Ras-like proteins and EF-Tu. In EF-Tu an important structural role in the switch mechanism has been inferred for the glycines (19Kjærsgård I.V.H. Knudsen C.R. Wiborg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Knudsen C.R. Kjærsgård I.V.H. Wiborg O. Clark B.F.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the GDP-form of E. coli EF-Tu, helix B is flanked by Gly-83 and Gly-94. The conformational change involving helix B resembles the changes in p21ras. During activation an additional helical turn is formed at the carboxyl end of helix B at the expense of a turn at the beginning of the helix. Furthermore, the direction of helix B is dramatically shifted by an angle of 42° (11Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Thirup S. Nyborg J. Structure. 1993; 1: 35-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The shift in conformation also involves the movement of domain 1 relative to domains 2 and 3 corresponding to a rotation of 90.8° in relative orientation (11Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Thirup S. Nyborg J. Structure. 1993; 1: 35-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). As a result the big cleft between domain 1 and 2 is diminished; new side chains become solvent-exposed, and the overall shape turns more globular in the GTP form.In the GTP form helix B comprises residues 87-97 (YVKNMITGAAQ). The helix B region is evolutionarily well conserved for prokaryotic EF-Tu as well as its eukaryotic counterpart EF-1α. Lys-89 and Asn-90 are two of the most conserved residues, and in the GTP form their side chains are solvent-exposed with good inherent potentials for formation of secondary bonds to ligands.To elucidate their functional role in tRNA binding, Lys-89 and Asn-90 have been subjected to mutational analysis. Each has separately been mutated to either Ala or Glu.Theoretical speculations about the biochemical nature of the important intermediate in the elongation process, the ternary complex, has brought about many interesting studies in the last 2 decades (21Wiborg O. Andersen C. Knudsen C.R. Kristensen T.J. Clark B.F.C. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1993; 19: 3-15Google Scholar, 22Clark B.F.C. Kjeldgaard M. Barciszewski J. Sprinzl M. RajBhandary T. Söll D. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 423Google Scholar). No unequivocal determination of macromolecular recognitory interaction sites has so far been established.To map the interaction points of EF-Tu and aa-tRNA, different chemical modification studies have been applied in addition to cross-linking and site-directed mutagenesis studies.Modification studies on the ternary complex have revealed that His-66 and His-118 and at least one of the methionines 91, 98, or 112 are protected against chemical modification (23Jonák J. Petersen T.E. Meloun B. Rychlík I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Jonák J. Rychlík I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 908: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This indicates that these residues make up part of a tRNA binding site. In support of this His-66 has been cross-linked to a modified aa-tRNA, Nϵ-bromoacetyl-Lys-tRNA, indicating that His-66 is in close proximity to the aminoacyl moiety of aa-tRNA (25Duffy K.L. Gerber L. Johnson A.E. Miller D.L. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4663-4666Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).In another attempt EF-Tu fragments 56-68 and 118-124 were identified as cross-linking to aa-tRNA (26Metz-Boutigue M.-H. Reinbolt J. Ebel J.-P. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The cross-linking agent was trans-diaminedichloroplatinum (II), which is only about 7 Å long, and the cross-linking sites potentially His-66 and His-118, respectively.Enzymatic characterization of EF-Tu mutants in which His-66 was mutated to Ala and His-118 replaced by either Ala or Glu have confirmed the results from chemical studies (27Andersen C. Wiborg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).In this report we have extended the characterization of these mutants to include studies on their ability to sustain poly(Phe) synthesis.The functional role of Lys-89, Asn-90, His-66, and His-118 is discussed in relation to structural analysis of the ternary complex.DISCUSSIONThermal and chemical stability assays indicate K89A and K89E to be slightly more unstable in the GDP form compared with wild type (Table I). Structural determination of EF-Tu·GDP indicates the presence of a salt bridge between Lys-89 and Asp-315 (10Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 721-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This salt bridge is, however, not present in the GTP form (11Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Thirup S. Nyborg J. Structure. 1993; 1: 35-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The concern for the K89E mutant is that a lysine residue was substituted by a glutamate, thus replacing electrostatic attraction with repulsion. Also for K89A the possibilities of salt bridge formation with Asp-315 were disrupted due to the substitution.From Table II the intrinsic GTPase activity given as kcat/Km appears to be maintained for K89A, K89E, and N90A, i.e. neither nucleotide affinity nor the hydrolytic mechanism is affected by the mutations. Only for N90E a slight decrease is observed, which is primarily due to a lower GTP affinity as reflected by an increase in Km. A lower GTP affinity of N90E could also explain a reduced thermal stability of the GTP form of this mutant (Table I). Stimulation of GTPase activity seems essentially maintained for all mutants (data not shown). It should be noted, however, that the strong stimulatory effect of kirromycin is less pronounced for Lys-89 mutants.The biological function of EF-Tu, as measured by its ability to sustain peptide synthesis, was tested in an in vitro translation assay. The mutants H66A, H118A, and H118E, which all have been described in a previous paper (27Andersen C. Wiborg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), were also tested in this assay (Table III). When nucleotide exchange factor EF-Ts was included in the assay all mutants, except the two His-118 mutants, sustained poly(Phe) synthesis at approximately the same rate as wild type. In contrast to this, His-118 mutants show drastically reduced activities. Also without EF-Ts the poly(Phe) synthesis rate is significantly reduced for H118E and hardly above the background level (Table III). More remarkably, the rates for Lys-89 mutants are 2-3-fold higher than wild type, when EF-Ts is omitted. This suggests a higher unstimulated nucleotide exchange rate for these mutants. In support of this the stimulatory effect of kirromycin on GTPase activity was observed to be much reduced for the Lys-89 mutants compared with wild type (data not shown). Also thermal and chemical stability of the Lys-89 mutants were shown to be reduced for the GDP form, and unchanged for the GTP form, when comparing to wild type (Table I). Thus a relatively higher stability of the GTP form could explain a higher unstimulated nucleotide exchange rate for the Lys-89 mutants. Helix B, which includes Lys-89, could on the basis of these results be suggested to be part of a target region of nucleotide exchange factor EF-Ts.The tRNA affinity was significantly reduced for all mutants as measured in three different assays. The equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, the dissociation rate constant, k−1, and the nonenzymatic hydrolysis rate all show a reduction in tRNA affinity upon mutation of either Lys-89 or Asn-90 (Table IV).The importance of Lys-89 and Asn-90 is emphasized by their location within helix B and by their evolutionary conserved nature.During the structural switch to the GTP form, i.e. the one active in tRNA binding, helix B undergoes some remarkable overall changes. With respect to amino acid numbering helix B is moved by one turn of a helix toward the C terminus, and more dramatically, the direction of the helix is shifted by an angle of 42° (11Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Thirup S. Nyborg J. Structure. 1993; 1: 35-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).It should be noted that during the structural switch the side chains of Lys-89 and Asn-90 in the GTP form becomes solvent-exposed, thus the ϵ-amino group of Lys-89 seems to interact with water molecules rather than being engaged in formation of an internal salt bridge. Exposure of these residues speaks in favor of their important role in tRNA binding.Recently the ternary complex was crystallized in our lab, and structural studies have revealed that Lys-89 and Asn-90 together with Arg-288 constitute the primary tRNA binding site. The three residues act as the docking site for the tRNA 5′ end. Structural analysis has shown that Arg-288 forms a salt bridge to the phosphate group of the 5′ end, and Lys-89 and Asn-90 interact with the ribose of the 5′ nucleotide of the tRNA (48Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F.C. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar).Conserved amino acid specific residues involved in docking of the 3′ CCA-Phe end are Glu-259, Val-225, and Ile-219. Finally the third region, the T stem, interacting with EF-Tu is contacted by the conserved residues Arg-318, His-319, Glu-329, and Thr-338. Additional interaction points are established through main chain atoms. Our kinetic data on Lys-89 and Asn-90 mutants strongly support structural analysis of the ternary complex. Thus Kd is increased by a factor of 8 for K89A and even more for K89E, N90A, and N90E. An approximate estimate indicates that this would in energetic terms correspond to the loss of a salt bridge or a few hydrogen bonds. For the mutant K89E the introduction of electrostatic repulsion toward tRNA backbone phosphates consequently reduces tRNA affinity to the lowest one of all four mutants (Table IV). It should be noted, however, that for all Lys-89 and Asn-90 mutants the reduced tRNA affinity does not affect poly(Phe) synthesis rates (Table III). There may be several reasons for this; one reason is that the Phe-tRNAPhe concentration in the in vitro assay is rather high, and another reason could be that the in vitro rates in general are far below the in vivo rates.The aminoacyl end of the aa-tRNA is located in the cleft between domains 1 and 2. In the case of Phe-tRNAPhe this part is stabilized through hydrophobic stacking between phenylalanine, attached to the tRNA, and His-66. This explains why His-66 mutations have reduced affinity for Phe-tRNAPhe and also the outcome of chemical cross-linking and protection studies (23Jonák J. Petersen T.E. Meloun B. Rychlík I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Jonák J. Rychlík I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 908: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 25Duffy K.L. Gerber L. Johnson A.E. Miller D.L. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4663-4666Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Metz-Boutigue M.-H. Reinbolt J. Ebel J.-P. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).The tRNA affinity of His-118 mutants is much reduced (27Andersen C. Wiborg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and so is their ability to sustain poly(Phe) synthesis (Table III). From a structural point of view the role of His-118 is unclear, and an explanation of our kinetic data on the mutants is not straightforward. The solvent-accessible surface area of His-118 has been measured to 0.5 Å2 in the GDP structure and 0 Å2 in that of GDPNP (11Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Thirup S. Nyborg J. Structure. 1993; 1: 35-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). His-118 is buried in the interface between domains 1 and 3 in both structural forms, and as the GTP conformation of EF-Tu is identical to the conformation of EF-Tu within the ternary complex, His-118 can hardly be directly involved in the binding of tRNA. The side chain of His-118 only forms hydrogen bonds to the backbone nitrogen of Gly-18 so even by structural examination an indirect role of His-118 in tRNA binding is still difficult to pinpoint.As the functional role of His-118 is not obvious from inspection of established structures of EF-Tu, a functional role may be implicated when taking into account the dynamic properties of the enzyme. When EF-Tu undergoes its structural transformation, from the inactive GDP form to the tRNA binding GTP form, domains 1 and 3 have been suggested to dissociate temporarily (11Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Thirup S. Nyborg J. Structure. 1993; 1: 35-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). This would expose His-118 to the solvent and make it more likely to be involved in the structural transformation process, thus suggesting an indirect role of His-118 in tRNA binding. INTRODUCTIONElongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) 1The abbreviations used are: EFelongation factoraa-tRNAaminoacyl-tRNAG-proteinguanine nucleotide-binding proteinGDPNPguanine 5′-(β,γ-imidotriphosphate)DTTdithiothreitol. is a key enzyme in protein biosynthesis. In its active conformation with GTP as a cofactor, it carries aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) to the A-site of the programmed ribosome in the process of decoding mRNA (1Miller D.L. Weissbach H. Weissbach H. Petska S. Molecular Mechanisms of Protein Biosynthesis. Academic Press, New York1977: 323Crossref Google Scholar). The complex of EF-Tu, GTP, and aa-tRNA has been denoted the ternary complex. During peptide bond formation GTP is hydrolyzed and EF-Tu adopts its inactive conformation, which has a negligible affinity for aa-tRNA. Nucleotide exchange factor EF-Ts catalyzes the replacement of GDP with GTP thereby completing the cycle. EF-Tu-dependent GTP hydrolysis is a rate-limiting step in protein biosynthesis and consequently is considered to be a step for proofreading of mRNA. The ribosome and aa-tRNA act as stimulating effectors of the GTPase activity at this crucial step. In Escherichia coli peptide bond formation proceeds at a rate of 10-20 bonds/s/ribosome (2Kennell D. Riezman H. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).E. coli EF-Tu is a monomeric protein consisting of 393 amino acid residues and with a molecular mass of 43.2 kDa. The nucleotide sequences of the two EF-Tu encoding genes tufA and tufB have been determined (3Yokota T. Sugisaki H. Takanami M. Kaziro Y. Gene (Amst.). 1980; 12: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4An G. Friesen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 1980; 12: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and so has the amino acid sequence of EF-Tu (5Jones M.D. Petersen T.E. Nielsen K.M. Magnusson S. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gausing K. Clark B.F.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 108: 507-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The two genes differ only in 13 nucleotide positions, and the two gene products are identical except for the C-terminal position, which is a glycine in the tufA gene product and a serine in the tufB product. The existence of two almost identical genes encoding EF-Tu has been suggested to be part of a complicated bioregulatory mechanism (6Bosch L. Kraal B. van der Meide P.H. Duisterwinkel F.J. van Noort J.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 30: 91-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).EF-Tu is a member of the guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins), which include the Ras superfamily and the heterotrimeric G-proteins (7Kaziro Y. Hiroshio I. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The G-proteins all possess a G-domain and consequently the capability to cycle between a GTP-bound “on-state” and a GDP-bound “off-state.” The G-domain has thus been described as a molecular switch (8Woolley P. Clark B.F.C. Bio/Technology. 1989; 7: 913-920Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2660) Google Scholar).The crystallographic structure of EF-Tu has been solved in complex with both GDP and a GTP analogue (Fig. 1) (10Kjeldgaard M.

The structure of the G-protein elongation factor G has been solved in a nucleotide-free form and in complex with GDP (16Czworkowski J. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Moore P.B.

The structure of the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein, Gi1, has been solved in complex with GTP and a transition state analogue (18Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.E. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar).For representatives of the three main groups of G-proteins, where both the active and inactive conformations are known, EF-Tu, p21ras, and transducin, there seems to be a distinct mechanism for the conformational change from the GTP to the GDP conformation. Nevertheless, for all three proteins one of the major structural changes involves the helix following the second nucleotide interacting loop. In EF-Tu this helix is named helix B.Helix B is flanked by two strictly conserved glycines in the Ras-like proteins and EF-Tu. In EF-Tu an important structural role in the switch mechanism has been inferred for the glycines (19Kjærsgård I.V.H. Knudsen C.R. Wiborg O. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1995; 228: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the GDP-form of E. coli EF-Tu, helix B is flanked by Gly-83 and Gly-94. The conformational change involving helix B resembles the changes in p21ras. During activation an additional helical turn is formed at the carboxyl end of helix B at the expense of a turn at the beginning of the helix. Furthermore, the direction of helix B is dramatically shifted by an angle of 42° (11Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Thirup S. Nyborg J. Structure. 1993; 1: 35-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The shift in conformation also involves the movement of domain 1 relative to domains 2 and 3 corresponding to a rotation of 90.8° in relative orientation (11Kjeldgaard M. Nissen P. Thirup S. Nyborg J. Structure. 1993; 1: 35-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). As a result the big cleft between domain 1 and 2 is diminished; new side chains become solvent-exposed, and the overall shape turns more globular in the GTP form.In the GTP form helix B comprises residues 87-97 (YVKNMITGAAQ). The helix B region is evolutionarily well conserved for prokaryotic EF-Tu as well as its eukaryotic counterpart EF-1α. Lys-89 and Asn-90 are two of the most conserved residues, and in the GTP form their side chains are solvent-exposed with good inherent potentials for formation of secondary bonds to ligands.To elucidate their functional role in tRNA binding, Lys-89 and Asn-90 have been subjected to mutational analysis.

Under conditions where ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme accumulates (leaky vesicles, 5°C, pH 8, 300 mM K+), luminal Ca2+ dissociation is sequential as well, so that the representation of two superimposed Ca2+ ions still holds on the phosphoenzyme, with the superficial Ca2+ facing the lumen freely exchangeable and the deeper Ca2+ blocked by the superficial Ca2+.Under the same conditions, we have investigated whether a prebuilt Ca2+ order is maintained during membrane translocation. Starting from a prebuilt order on the cytoplasmic side, we showed that the Ca2+ ions cannot be identified after translocation to the luminal side. The same result was obtained starting from a prebuilt order on the luminal side and following the luminal to cytoplasmic translocation. We conclude that the two Ca2+ ions are mixed during ATP-induced phosphorylation as well as during ADP-induced dephosphorylation.

Starting from a prebuilt order on the cytoplasmic side, we showed that the Ca2+ ions cannot be identified after translocation to the luminal side. The same result was obtained starting from a prebuilt order on the luminal side and following the luminal to cytoplasmic translocation. We conclude that the two Ca2+ ions are mixed during ATP-induced phosphorylation as well as during ADP-induced dephosphorylation. INTRODUCTIONSarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase is a membranous enzyme that pumps Ca2+ from the cytoplasm of muscle cells into the reticulum lumen, requiring ATP hydrolysis. During its cycle, each ATPase monomer transports two Ca2+ ions (Scheme 1). During transport, the Ca2+ sites change their orientation and affinity, depending on whether the ATPase is phosphorylated. The high affinity transport sites of the nonphosphorylated ATPase are accessible from the cytoplasm, whereas once the ATPase has been phosphorylated the transport sites have lower affinity and are accessible from the lumen. This allows Ca2+ release into the SR 1The abbreviations used are: SRsarcoplasmic reticulumTesN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acidBAPTA1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidFIFOfirst-in-first-outFILOfirst-in-last-out. lumen and is followed by dephosphorylation. Scheme 1.Equation 1 Ca2+ binding to E, the Ca2+-deprived nonphosphorylated ATPase, has been well characterized. Two Ca2+ ions bind sequentially with high affinity and positive cooperativity (1Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Forge V. Mintz E. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10953-10960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 1982, Dupont (3Dupont Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) showed that the dissociation of one-half of the 45Ca2+ bound to Ca2E was impaired by the presence of excess 40Ca2+ in the medium. This was interpreted in 1987 by Inesi (4Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as two sites being sequentially accessible from the cytoplasm by the two Ca2+ ions in a crevice with a deep site and a superficial site (Fig. 2). The first ion must reach the deep site to leave the superficial site vacant for the second ion to bind. The Ca2+ bound to the superficial site is freely exchangeable with free Ca2+ in the outer medium, whereas the Ca2+ bound to the deep site is not. Inesi took advantage of the possibility of selectively placing a 40Ca2+ on top of a 45Ca2+, to determine whether their dissociation toward the lumen is sequential. He concluded that this was the case and that the first Ca2+ bound to E was the first to be internalized by monitoring the internalization of the Ca2+ ions after phosphorylation. This would correspond to a channel-like structure with a first-in-first-out mechanism for membrane crossing.The question of whether the dissociation of the Ca2+ ions toward the lumen is sequential or not has been reinvestigated by Hanel and Jencks (5Hanel A.M. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11320-11330Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Orlowski and Champeil (6Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11331-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Both groups concluded that the two ions cannot be kinetically distinguished, probably because Ca2+ dissociation from the phosphorylated ATPase starts with a rate-limiting deocclusion step. More recently, Forge et al. (7Forge V. Mintz E. Canet D. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18271-18276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have shown that under appropriate conditions (pH 8, 300 mM K+, 5°C), the two ions dissociate sequentially from the phosphorylated ATPase, suggesting that Ca2+ dissociation was intrinsically sequential on both sides of the membrane.As with the nonphosphorylated ATPase, the Ca2+ sites of the phosphorylated ATPase may be represented by a crevice with a deep site and a superficial site accessible from the lumen (Fig. 3). The initial suggestion arising from these sketches is that the first ion to bind to the ATPase is the first to dissociate after transport, as originally proposed by Inesi (4Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the conditions chosen by Forge et al. (7Forge V. Mintz E. Canet D. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18271-18276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have revealed the sequentiality of the luminal dissociation, they appear to be particularly appropriate for reinvestigating whether the Ca2+ ion order is kept during transport. We show that there is mixing of the two Ca2+ ions in the Ca2+-bound phosphoenzyme; i.e. the first Ca2+ bound to the nonphosphorylated ATPase cannot be identified as being the first or the second to dissociate toward the lumen. This is also shown for the reverse step, i.e. during the ADP-induced dephosphorylation of Ca2E-PMg.Fig. 3Luminal Ca2+ dissociation and exchange. ATPase was first phosphorylated by manual perfusion with 100 µM 45Ca2+ plus 90 µM EGTA, 3 mM Mg2+, 100 µM [γ-32P]ATP and perfused with 1 mM Mg2+ in Ca2+-poor media as described under “Materials and Methods” (A) or 1 mM Mg2+ plus 10 mM 40Ca2+ (B) for various times. 300 mM K+ was present throughout the experiments. ∘, ▿, bound 45Ca2+; □, ⋄, phosphoenzyme.

(2Forge V. Mintz E. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10953-10960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at 3°C in a cold room. The buffer was 100 mM Tes-Tris, pH 8, plus 1 or 3 mM Mg2+ and 0 or 300 mM K+, as specified in the figure legends. It was prepared with water filtered through a Milli-Q Water Purification System (Millipore Corp., Milford, MA). All salts were added as chlorides. Vesicles were made leaky by an incubation of at least 1 h at 2 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris, 10 mM K+, 2 mM EDTA at room temperature.Ca2+ Binding and Phosphoenzyme MeasurementsCa2+ binding and phosphoenzyme levels were measured by the filtration technique. Kinetic measurements involving 45Ca2+ or [γ-32P]ATP all started with the same incubation and rinsing steps. Vesicles (0.2 mg/ml) were first incubated in the pH 8 buffer. One ml of this suspension was deposited on a filter (Millipore HA 0.45 µm), and the adsorbed vesicles were perfused with 1 ml of 100 µM EGTA to rinse EDTA with a Ca2+-deprived buffer. For experiments starting from Ca2E (Figs. 2, 4, and 5), ATPase was converted to this state by manually perfusing the filters for 5 s with 1 ml of 100 µM 45Ca2+ (or 40Ca2+) plus 90 µM EGTA and 3 mM Mg2+. Cytoplasmic isotopic exchanges were performed in the absence of K+ by perfusing 100 µM 45Ca2+ (or 40Ca2+) plus 3 mM Mg2+. For experiments starting from Ca2E-PMg (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6), ATPase was converted to this state by manually perfusing the filters for 5 s with 2 ml of 100 µM 45Ca2+ (or 40Ca2+) plus 90 µM EGTA, 100 µM [γ-32P]ATP (or ATP), 3 mM Mg2+, and 300 mM K+. Unless otherwise specified, the kinetic measurements were begun immediately after this step using a rapid filtration system (Bio-Logic, Claix, France). They were carried out by perfusing media containing EGTA, or 40Ca2+, with or without ADP, for various times.Fig. 4ADP-induced Ca2+ dissociation and dephosphorylation: double filtration system experiment. ATPase was first manually perfused with 100 µM 45Ca2+, 90 µM EGTA, 3 mM Mg2+ to saturate the cytoplasmic sites. It was then perfused by the first system with 100 µM 45Ca2+, 90 µM EGTA, 100 µM [γ-32P]ATP, 3 mM Mg2+, 300 mM K+ for 0.4 s and by the second system with 1 mM ADP, 1 mM EGTA, 300 mM K+ for various times. •, bound 45Ca2+; ▪, phosphoenzyme.

In A, the prebuilt cytoplasmic order was a 40Ca2+ on top of a 45Ca2+. It was obtained by manually saturating the cytoplasmic sites with 45Ca2+ and perfusing 100 µM 40Ca2+ for 8 s, as in Fig. 2. Phosphorylation was then induced by perfusing 100 µM 40Ca2+ plus 90 µM EGTA, 100 µM ATP, 300 mM K+ with the first filtration system. In B, the prebuilt cytoplasmic order was a 45Ca2+ on top of a 40Ca2+. Cytoplasmic order and phosphorylation were achieved as in A, except for the presence of 45Ca2+ instead of 40Ca2+. In C, cytoplasmic sites were saturated with 40Ca2+, and the cytoplasmic exchange was simulated with 40Ca2+ to reproduce the same protocol as in A and B. Phosphorylation was then achieved as in A, except for the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. In A, B, and C, once the cytoplasmic order was built and 2 s after phosphorylation has started, the second filtration system perfused ATPase either with 10 mM EGTA (∘, □, •, ▪) or 10 mM 40Ca2+ (▿, ⋄, ▾, ♦) in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+ and 300 mM K+ for various times.

[γ-32P]ATP or 45Ca2+ contained in the wet volume was subtracted from the total 32P or 45Ca counts to evaluate the phosphoenzyme and the Ca2+ bound to the ATPase. The values for the curves plotted in Figs. 3, 5, and 6 are the average of two to six experiments (±S.E.).Ca2+ dissociation kinetics in Fig. 3A were the same, whether measured in presence of contaminating Ca2+, 1 or 10 mM EGTA, or 1 mM BAPTA. Ca2+ dissociation kinetics proved to be insensitive to the Ca2+ ionophore calcimycin (4%, w/w). Therefore, the curve in Fig. 3A is the average of experiments conducted under these various conditions.Double Filtration SystemTwo rapid filtration systems from Bio-Logic (8Dupont Y. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were associated to ensure that the phosphorylation reaction would last precisely for a short period of time and therefore be reproducible. Indeed, when manual phosphorylation is performed before kinetics perfusion by a single system, there can be 5-10 s between the beginning of the manual filtration of the phosphorylation medium and the beginning of the perfusion driven by the filtration system; for some experiments, this time lag is too long. To avoid this difficulty, we have coupled two rapid filtration systems face to face and linked them by rails on which the filter holder slides from one system to the other (Fig. 1). At the end of the filtration by the first system, the filter holder is manually moved from the first system to the second system rapidly enough to ensure that there are <1.5 s between the end of the first perfusion and the beginning of the second.Fig. 1Double filtration system. F, filter holder on rails; S1, electronically controlled syringe belonging to the first rapid filtration system; S2, electronically controlled syringe belonging to the second rapid filtration system. When the filter holder is in position P1, the filter (with the previously adsorbed SR vesicles) can be perfused by the first system (for phosphorylation here). The filter holder is then pulled toward the second system. In position P2, the filter can be perfused by the second system (kinetics were obtained here by perfusing for various times with the second system).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For the experiments described here, the first filtration system was used to deliver phosphorylation substrate during 0.4 s, and the second filtration system was used to perfuse the various experimental media precisely 2 s after the phosphorylation perfusion had started. This ensured that each kinetic measurement started from the same initial state. The experiments shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 were carried out with this combined system. All other steps preceding the use of the double filtration system were done as described above when using a single filtration system.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this work was to study a particular feature of Ca2+ ion transport, namely the putative FIFO mechanism. Inesi (4Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that two different Ca2+ isotopes can be superimposed in the cytoplasmic sites and Forge et al. (7Forge V. Mintz E. Canet D. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18271-18276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), using specific conditions, demonstrated that the same superimposition was possible in the luminal sites. There is some controversy about the luminal sequentiality, because Inesi (4Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that luminal dissociation was sequential, whereas Hanel and Jencks (5Hanel A.M. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11320-11330Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Orlowski and Champeil (6Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11331-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) found that the Ca2+ ions were not distinguishable during luminal dissociation. This controversy indicates that under the usual conditions the sequentiality is difficult to investigate and may depend critically on a number of factors.Starting from this observation, Forge et al. (7Forge V. Mintz E. Canet D. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18271-18276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) defined a set of conditions that allow accumulation of Ca2E-PMg, the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme, stabilizing this phosphoenzyme long enough to start the luminal dissociation perfusion before it has significantly turned over, and finally to ensure high affinity for the luminal Ca2+ sites (300 mM K+, pH 8, and 5°C). These conditions were used here to identify, during its luminal dissociation, a Ca2+ ion that had been specifically bound to one or the other cytoplasmic site. We interpret the data presented here as resulting from a mixing of the two Ca2+ ions occurring after binding and during translocation.Mg2+ at the Catalytic SiteIn 1987, Inesi (4Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed a FIFO mechanism for Ca2+ translocation on the basis of the following evidence: phosphorylation of ATPase with two bound 45Ca2+ ions induced biphasic Ca2+ internalization, suggesting that the two ions dissociate sequentially, whereas phosphorylation of ATPase with a 40Ca2+ bound on top of a 45Ca2+ induced fast monophasic luminal Ca2+ dissociation, suggesting that the deep 45Ca2+ was the first to dissociate. However, these experiments were conducted under conditions that probably lead to phosphorylation by both CaATP and MgATP. Because a phosphoenzyme with Ca2+ at its catalytic site releases Ca2+ much more slowly than a phosphoenzyme with Mg2+ at its catalytic site (13Shigekawa M. Wakabayashi S. Nakamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8698-8707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the two phases could be attributed to Ca2+ dissociation from Ca2E-PMg (rapid phase) and to Ca2+ dissociation from Ca2E-PCa (slow phase), rather than to sequential dissociation of the two Ca2+ ions from a unique phosphoenzyme.Being aware of this difficulty, we used the filtration technique which allows, under our conditions, rinsing the phosphorylation substrates before perfusing high concentrations of Ca2+, thus avoiding the formation of CaATP complex. In some experiments, phosphorylation was performed in the presence of 100 µM Ca2+ and without EGTA which leads to a MgATP:CaATP ratio of ∼20, instead of ∼200 when there was 90 µM EGTA. We verified that there was no significant difference in Ca2+ dissociation kinetics from phosphoenzymes formed with or without EGTA, suggesting that even with a ratio of 20, 5% CaATP did not significantly perturb our measurements. The possibility that a direct substitution of Mg2+ at the catalytic site for Ca2+ occurred during luminal perfusion of Ca2E-PMg with 40Ca2+ has already been envisaged and ruled out by comparing luminal Ca2+ dissociation kinetics induced with various Mg2+ concentrations (7Forge V. Mintz E. Canet D. Guillain F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18271-18276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Transport Mechanism across the MembraneHanel and Jencks (5Hanel A.M. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11320-11330Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Orlowski and Champeil (6Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11331-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), in studying the luminal sequentiality could not distinguish the two Ca2+ ions and concluded that this was possibly due to a rate-limiting step preceding Ca2+ dissociation, i.e. a conformational change leading to Ca2+ deocclusion. Our particular conditions probably changed the rate-limiting step from this deocclusion step to the true Ca2+ dissociation step. Because we were able under these conditions to manipulate the phosphoenzyme and therefore the luminal oriented Ca2+ sites, we studied the Ca2+ order during transport from the cytoplasmic to the luminal side, as well as from the luminal to the cytoplasmic side. We followed each of the two Ca2+ ions selectively labeled on the cytoplasmic side and found that the EGTA- and 40Ca2+-induced dissociation kinetics were different for each ion. Therefore, any ordered mechanism such as FIFO or FILO was ruled out. In contrast, the data favor the occurrence of ion mixing during transport. The same mixing was observed during ADP-induced dephosphorylation.Therefore, there seems to be an intermediate and transient species of the phosphoenzyme in which the Ca2+ ions are randomized, even though they are ordered on both cytoplasmic and luminal sides (Schemes 2 and 3).Bearing in mind the common assumption that there are two Ca2+ sites located in a narrow channel that change their affinity and orientation during phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, our findings suggest that the randomization of the Ca2+ ions occurs during these chemical reactions and probably during the so-called occlusion step. However, this is in contradiction with the idea of a narrow channel in the phosphoenzyme, since during this step the Ca2+ ions are occluded and need to exchange positions, as if their binding to the amino acid residues and the local structure were becoming loose.Site-directed mutagenesis results show six charged residues belonging to the putative membrane helices M4, M5, M6, and M8 as critical residues for Ca2+ transport (14Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. McLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), and among them five were critical for Ca2+ occlusion (15Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15931-15936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility that the two Ca2+ ions can be superimposed in a channel formed by M4, M5, M6, and M8 is still discussed in the literature (17Inesi G. Kirtley M.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 116: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Toyoshima C. Sasabe H. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1993; 362: 469-471Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 19Andersen J.P. Biosci.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Mészáros L.G. Bak J.Z.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7030-7034Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Myung J. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8775-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) proposed that the cytoplasmic and luminal sites could be distinct; i.e. there are four Ca2+ sites on the ATPase. Making this assumption and given our results, there would be during phosphorylation and dephosphorylation a transfer of the Ca2+ ions from one pair of sites to the other, during which the Ca2+ ions would be randomized (Scheme 4A). Martonosi (25Martonosi A.N. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 263-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) proposed a structural model accounting for four possible sites with two channels, including the above described channel and an additional channel, formed by M2, M3, M4, and M5. Since each Ca2+ ion in this model crosses the membrane in its own channel, it does not allow the mixing observed in our results. This model to be correct should include, at least during phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, a different arrangement of the six helices mentioned above, i.e. in a tubular hexagonal structure allowing the Ca2+ ions to mix (Scheme 4B). In this context, note that the representation of the two Ca2+ ions as being superimposed is a choice of one possible structure (the simplest one) among others to interpret the sequential dissociation. The only requirement derived from experiment is that the Ca2+ sites are not independent. Scheme 4.Equation 4 Because the two Ca2+ ions are thought to be randomized during their translocation, it appears necessary to include a major structural change involving the Ca2+ sites. Starting from an ordered state for the Ca2+ ions, the chemical reaction (phosphorylation or dephosphorylation) must lead to another ordered state for the Ca2+ ions through a transient state where the Ca2+ coordinations become loose and allow randomization. Because phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions are very rapid, this transient state may have not been seen in structural studies (for references, see Ref. 25Martonosi A.N. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 263-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). INTRODUCTIONSarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase is a membranous enzyme that pumps Ca2+ from the cytoplasm of muscle cells into the reticulum lumen, requiring ATP hydrolysis. During its cycle, each ATPase monomer transports two Ca2+ ions (Scheme 1). During transport, the Ca2+ sites change their orientation and affinity, depending on whether the ATPase is phosphorylated.

Scheme 1.Equation 1 Ca2+ binding to E, the Ca2+-deprived nonphosphorylated ATPase, has been well characterized.

In 1982, Dupont (3Dupont Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) showed that the dissociation of one-half of the 45Ca2+ bound to Ca2E was impaired by the presence of excess 40Ca2+ in the medium. This was interpreted in 1987 by Inesi (4Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as two sites being sequentially accessible from the cytoplasm by the two Ca2+ ions in a crevice with a deep site and a superficial site (Fig. 2). The first ion must reach the deep site to leave the superficial site vacant for the second ion to bind. The Ca2+ bound to the superficial site is freely exchangeable with free Ca2+ in the outer medium, whereas the Ca2+ bound to the deep site is not. Inesi took advantage of the possibility of selectively placing a 40Ca2+ on top of a 45Ca2+, to determine whether their dissociation toward the lumen is sequential. He concluded that this was the case and that the first Ca2+ bound to E was the first to be internalized by monitoring the internalization of the Ca2+ ions after phosphorylation. This would correspond to a channel-like structure with a first-in-first-out mechanism for membrane crossing.The question of whether the dissociation of the Ca2+ ions toward the lumen is sequential or not has been reinvestigated by Hanel and Jencks (5Hanel A.M.

Both groups concluded that the two ions cannot be kinetically distinguished, probably because Ca2+ dissociation from the phosphorylated ATPase starts with a rate-limiting deocclusion step.

https://openalex.org/W1968529995,"The early transcribed adenovirus proteins E1A and E1B display a variety of functions in the transformation of primary rodent cells and the regulation of apoptosis and transcription. We have recently shown recently that the E1B 19 kDa protein from Adenovirus 5 (Ad 5) can functionally antagonize the stimulatory effect of E1A 13S on the human transcription factor NF-κB. Here we show that expression of E1B 19 kDa negatively interfered with the activation of NF-κB by different stimuli, such as the E1A 13S protein, and treatment with phorbol ester and tumor necrosis factor α. This suggests that E1B 19 kDa acts on a common upstream signaling event. Band shift experiments showed that expression of E1B 19 kDa impaired the generation of the nuclear, DNA-binding form of NF-κB. Domain mapping experiments employing various E1B 19 kDa mutants revealed the necessity of a hydrophobic Bcl-2 homology region between amino acids 90 and 96 for NF-κB inhibition. Co-transfection experiments showed that the inhibitory effect of E1B 19 kDa on E1A 13S-activated NF-κB transcription was gradually lost in the course of time. Thus the continuous stimulatory action of E1A 13S can finally override the antagonistic effects of E1B 19 kDa on NF-κB activity. In contrast to E1B 19 kDa, expression of the E1B 55 kDa protein did not result in a de novo activation of NF-κB, but co-stimulated the transcriptional potential of activated NF-κB. The early transcribed adenovirus proteins E1A and E1B display a variety of functions in the transformation of primary rodent cells and the regulation of apoptosis and transcription. We have recently shown recently that the E1B 19 kDa protein from Adenovirus 5 (Ad 5) can functionally antagonize the stimulatory effect of E1A 13S on the human transcription factor NF-κB. Here we show that expression of E1B 19 kDa negatively interfered with the activation of NF-κB by different stimuli, such as the E1A 13S protein, and treatment with phorbol ester and tumor necrosis factor α. This suggests that E1B 19 kDa acts on a common upstream signaling event. Band shift experiments showed that expression of E1B 19 kDa impaired the generation of the nuclear, DNA-binding form of NF-κB. Domain mapping experiments employing various E1B 19 kDa mutants revealed the necessity of a hydrophobic Bcl-2 homology region between amino acids 90 and 96 for NF-κB inhibition. Co-transfection experiments showed that the inhibitory effect of E1B 19 kDa on E1A 13S-activated NF-κB transcription was gradually lost in the course of time. Thus the continuous stimulatory action of E1A 13S can finally override the antagonistic effects of E1B 19 kDa on NF-κB activity. In contrast to E1B 19 kDa, expression of the E1B 55 kDa protein did not result in a de novo activation of NF-κB, but co-stimulated the transcriptional potential of activated NF-κB. INTRODUCTIONAdenoviruses are widespread in vertebrates and have been isolated from amphibians to humans. Human adenoviruses cause a variety of diseases affecting the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tract and the ocular system (Evans, 15Evans A.S. Am. J. Hyg. 1958; 67: 256-629PubMed Google Scholar; Fox et al., 17Fox J.P. Hall C.E. Cooney M.K. Am. J. Epidemiol. 1977; 105: 362-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Adenoviruses of the subgenus C, including Ad 2, Ad 5, and Ad 7, 1The abbreviations used are: AdadenovirusCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusLTRlong terminal repeatNK cellsnatural killer cellsPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateTNF-αtumor necrosis factor αILinterleukinRSVRous sarcoma virus. often cause diseases of the respiratory tract. The viral genome is a linear, double-stranded DNA molecule encoding at least 30 genes. The left 11% of the adenovirus genome comprises early region 1, which encodes the transcriptional units for the regulatory proteins E1A and E1B (Akusjärvi, 1Akusjärvi G. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 163-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar; Wold and Gooding, 62Wold W.S.M. Gooding L.R. Virology. 1991; 184: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).The E1A region codes for two major proteins of 243 (12S) and 289 (13S) amino acids length which have transforming activity. E1A proteins were also found to regulate transcription of some viral and cellular promoters (Akusjärvi, 1Akusjärvi G. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 163-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the absence of any apparent DNA binding activity, these transcriptional effects are due to the association of E1A to some host proteins, including the transcription factors ATF-2, Oct-4, and Sp1 (Schöler et al., 42Schöler H.R. Ciesiolka T. Gruss P. Cell. 1991; 66: 291-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar; Liu and Green, 29Liu F. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Furthermore the E1A protein can activate cell proliferation and induce apoptosis via a p53-mediated pathway (Debbas and White, 12Debbas M. White E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar; White, 56White E. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1993; 204: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).The E1B-encoding mRNA encodes two major unrelated proteins of 19 and 55 kDa molecular mass, respectively. Viral mutants lacking E1B give rise to large clear plaques on infected cell monolayers and are strongly defective in neoplastic transformation (Chinnadurai, 9Chinnadurai G. Cell. 1983; 33: 759-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The absence of the E1B 19 kDa during the productive infection of human cells induces the degradation of host and viral DNA as well as an enhanced cytopathic effect (Ezoe et al., 16Ezoe H. Laifatt R.B. Mak S. J. Virol. 1981; 40: 20-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Pilder et al., 35Pilder S. Logan J. Shenk T. J.

Both splice variants of E1B were found to strongly cooperate with E1A in cell transformation. This supportive effect of E1B in transformation is most likely due to its antiapoptotic properties (Rao et al., 36Rao L. Debbas M. Sabbatini P. Hockenberry D. Korsmeyer S. White E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7742-7746Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). This idea is reinforced by the finding that adenoviruses defective in E1B can be functionally complemented by the cellular Bcl-2 gene, which also acts as an inhibitor of apoptosis (Tarodi et al., 50Tarodi B. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Int. J. Oncol. 1993; 3: 467-472PubMed Google Scholar; Chiou et al., 10Chiou S.K. Tseng C.C. Rao L. White E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6553-6566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the functional complementation of E1B 19 kDa by Bcl-2 proteins in the inhibition of apoptosis, both proteins are membrane-anchored, contain three short regions with sequence similarity, and interact with a common set of cellular proteins (Boyd et al., 7Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramanian T. Venkatesh L.K. Schaeper U. Elangovan B. D'Sa E.C. Chinnadurai G. Cell. 1994; 79: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Both splice variants of E1B inhibit cell death induced by different apoptotic stimuli, such as E1A, the anti-cancer drug cisplatin, TNF-α, or Fas antigen, although the E1B 19 kDa protein does so more effectively (Gooding et al., 18Gooding L.R.

Gene (Amst.). 1993; 124: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Besides other functions affecting mRNA export and intermediate filament organization, both E1B splice variants were also found to interfere with transcription (White, 56White E. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1993; 204: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The E1B 55 kDa protein negatively interferes with p53-mediated gene expression by directly interacting with this transcription factor. E1B 55 kDa binds p53 without displacing it from its cognate DNA and abrogates transcription by a transcription repression domain within E1B (Yew et al., 64Yew P.R. Liu X. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The smaller 19 kDa splice variant does not block p53-mediated transactivation, but alleviates p53-mediated repression (Shen and Shenk, 45Shen Y. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar; Sabbatini et al., 37Sabbatini P. Chiou S.-K. Rao L. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1060-1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently observed that co-expression of E1B 19 kDa impairs the activation of transcription factor NF-κB by expression of the E1A 13S protein (Schmitz et al., 41Schmitz M.L. Indorf A. Limbourg F.P. Städtler H. Traenckner E.B.-M. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).Transcription factors belonging to the NF-κB/Rel family are specialized in the transduction of pathogenic signals from the cytoplasm to the cell nucleus. To date, five different DNA-binding subunits have been characterized and cloned in vertebrates. These DNA-binding subunits, including p50, p52, RelB, p65, and c-Rel, contact their cognate DNA-sequence as homodimers or heterodimers (Grilli et al., 20Grilli M. Chiu J.J. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar; Schmitz and Baeuerle, 40Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. NATO ASI Ser. H. 1995; 92: 279-303Google Scholar). They share a conserved domain of approximately 300 amino acids length in their N terminus, which is necessary for DNA binding, dimerization, and nuclear translocation (Baeuerle and Henkel, 2Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar; Verma et al., 52Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). The most frequently detected form of NF-κB is a p50/p65 dimer, which is cytoplasmically retained in most cell types by an inhibitory subunit, called IκB (Baeuerle and Henkel, 2Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar). Also the IκB proteins constitute a gene family and preferentially interact with different members of the NF-κB/Rel family (Beg and Baldwin, 3Beg A.A. Baldwin A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar; Israel, 25Israel A. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 203-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). NF-κB becomes readily activated upon stimulation of cells with a variety of mostly pathogenic conditions, including inflammatory cytokines, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, T cell mitogens, some viruses, and viral proteins, including E1A 13S. Apparently most if not all of the diverse inducers of NF-κB activity have in common that they lead to the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates, the phosphorylation of IκB at serines 32 and 36 and finally to its proteolytic degradation by the proteasome (Schmitz, 39Schmitz M.L. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82/83: 407-411Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar; Verma et al., 52Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). The released DNA-binding dimer subsequently enters the nucleus and binds to its cognate DNA. Transcriptional activation of the NF-κB target genes is mediated by the transactivating subunits c-Rel, RelB, and p65. The target genes include some viral genes such as adenovirus E3/19 kDa (Deryckere et al., 13Deryckere F. Ebenau-Jehle C. Wold W.S.M. Burgert H.-G. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and many cellular pathogen defense genes such as immunoreceptors, cell adhesion molecules, cytokines, hematopoetic growth factors, and acute phase proteins (Schmitz and Baeuerle, 40Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. NATO ASI Ser. H. 1995; 92: 279-303Google Scholar). The NF-κB signal transducing system is an integral part for the proper function of the immune system, since the targeted disruption of IκB-α, p50, p65, RelB, or c-Rel subunits deregulated immune responsiveness or resulted in lethal phenotypes (Beg et al., 1995a4Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9 (a): 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 1995b5Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D.

Cell. 1995; 80: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar).Since it is largely unknown how the E1B 19 kDa protein interferes with activation of NF-κB, several questions were addressed experimentally. In the present study we show that E1B 19 kDa inhibition of NF-κB activity was only transient and required a short hydrophobic sequence within the E1B 19 kDa protein. E1B 19 kDa from Adenoviruses 2 and 5 both inhibited NF-κB activated by the different inducers E1A 13S, phorbol ester, or TNF-α. The 55-kDa splice variant of E1B co-activated NF-κB-dependent transcription. The regulatory implications of the adenovirus proteins either activating (E1A 13S), co-activating (E1B 55 kDa), or repressing (E1B 19 kDa) NF-κB are discussed.DISCUSSIONHigher vertebrates have evolved various ways to control and counteract viral infections. One strategy is based on the elimination of infected cells by programmed cell death, another strategy is to elicit cellular and humoral immune responses. The pathogen-inducible NF-κB transcription factor family is a key factor in the cellular immune response because many of its cellular target genes, such as interferon-β, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-8, are immunologically of high relevance. Interferon-β is an important molecule conferring protection against viruses through induction of an intracellular antiviral state (Pellegrini and Schindler, 33Pellegrini S. Schindler C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 338-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It also activates natural killer (NK) cells. Another NF-κB regulated molecule essential for NK cell activity is major histocompatibility class I. Activation of NF-κB also leads to an increased expression of ELAM-1, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and IL-8. These proteins are required for the attachment and transmigration of leucocytes to the locus of infection. The cytokine TNF-α was found to synergize with interferons in the antiviral response (Wong and Goeddel, 63Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1986; 323: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). We found here that at least the two different serotypes Ad2 and Ad5, belonging to subgenus C of human adenoviruses, are equally capable of suppressing NF-κB activated by different inducers such as the E1A 13S protein, PMA, and TNF-α by means of preventing the generation of the active, nuclear form.We suggest that it is beneficial for the virus to efficiently counteract the various aspects of the immune reactions simultaneously by impairing NF-κB activity. The E1B 19 kDa protein is expressed within the first 10 h post-infection (Green et al., 19Green M. Brackmann K.H. Lucher L.A. Symington J.S. Kramer T.A. J. Virol. 1983; 48: 604-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Wold and Gooding, 62Wold W.S.M. Gooding L.R. Virology. 1991; 184: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar; Akusjärvi, 1Akusjärvi G. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 163-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We therefore speculate that it might be especially important for the virus to counteract NF-κB activity early in the course of the viral infection in order to escape an antiviral response. This might be the reason why the virus evolved a protein with conserved function between various adenovirus strains being able to counteract NF-κB activity.Alternatively higher vertebrates eliminate virus-infected cells by programmed cell death (White, 57White E. Nature. 1994; 371: 21-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar; Eick and Hermeking, 14Eick D. Hermeking H. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 4-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The antiapoptotic properties of the wild-type and numerous mutant forms of E1B 19 kDa have been investigated in some detail (White et al., 61White E. Sabbatini P. Debbas M. Wold W.S.M. Kusher D.I. Gooding L.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Subramanian et al., 48Subramanian T. Tarodi B. Govindarajan R. Boyd J.M. Yoshida K. Chinnadurai G. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 124: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar; Chiou et al., 10Chiou S.K. Tseng C.C. Rao L. White E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6553-6566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using cisplatin, TNF-α, and the E1A 13S protein as inducers of apoptosis, the regions required to inhibit cell death within E1B 19 kDa have been defined. Interestingly, the ability of E1B 19 kDa mutants to inhibit apoptosis can be separated from their ability to counteract NF-κB activation. The mutant E1B 19 kDa 50,51 EF-AS was fully active in NF-κB inhibition, but was found in a previous study to be incapable of inhibiting apoptosis (Subramanian et al., 48Subramanian T. Tarodi B. Govindarajan R. Boyd J.M. Yoshida K. Chinnadurai G. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 124: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with previous studies, showing that activation of NF-κB and apoptosis by TNF-receptor 1 are separate pathways (Hsu et al., 23Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 24Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Yet, there is evidence for different apoptotic pathways in viral infections requiring NF-κB activity (Lin et al., 28Lin K.-I. Lee S.-H. Narayanan R. Baraban J.M. Ratan R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that NF-κB activated during adenovirus infection (Bergmann and Shavit, 6Bergmann Y. Shavit D. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2073-2080PubMed Google Scholar) contributes to virus-induced cell death. In this scenario inhibition of NF-κB activity by E1B 19 kDa would also negatively interfere with apoptosis and thus ensure a prolonged replication time for the virus.In contrast to IκB-α, the co-expression of E1B 19 kDa protein blocked NF-κB activity not completely. A full repression of NF-κB might be detrimental for the adenovirus, since the expression of some adenovirus genes requires various host transcription factors, including NF-κB. An example for a NF-κB-regulated adenovirus gene is E3/19 kDa (Deryckere et al., 13Deryckere F. Ebenau-Jehle C. Wold W.S.M. Burgert H.-G. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). E3/19 kDa down-regulates major histocompatibility class I surface expression. For this immunosuppressive mechanism, it is essential for the virus to activate NF-κB upon E1A 13S expression. The transcription of the early adenovirus genes E1A and E1B is independent from NF-κB, rendering these virus proteins independent from their regulatory target. The incomplete inhibition of NF-κB by E1B 19 kDa leaves presumably enough NF-κB activity for the expression of its viral target genes. Furthermore, time course experiments showed that E1B 19 kDa impaired NF-κB activity only transiently. The transient nature of the repressing effect might simply be explained by altered stability of the E1B 19 kDa protein. A reversible, transient inhibition has the advantage that NF-κB activity can be determined solely by the relative amounts of E1A 13S and E1B 19 kDa. Another level of influencing NF-κB activity is provided by the slightly co-activating function of E1B 55 kDa. We suggest that it might be advantageous for the virus to possess a subtle system of regulatory proteins allowing a fine-tuning of NF-κB activity. Thus the virus can express its NF-κB regulated genes without being immediately destroyed by the action of the immune system or eventual apoptotic processes.It is currently unclear how the E1B 19 kDa protein inhibits NF-κB activity. We consider a direct interaction between E1A 13S and E1B 19 kDa to be rather unlikely, since E1B 19 kDa also inhibited NF-κB induced by PMA and TNF-α. The mapping experiments showed that deletion of the membrane anchoring domain between amino acids 90 and 96 strongly impaired the inhibitory function of E1B 19 kDa on NF-κB. In contrast to the wild-type E1B 19 kDa protein, which is predominantly localized in the nuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum, the mutant E1B 19 kDa Δ90-96 protein has been shown to be cytoplasmic (Subramanian, et al., 1993; Chiou, et al., 1994). The membrane attachment of the E1B 19 kDa protein might thus be of functional importance, as also seen for the Bcl-2 protein. Here, deletion of the C-terminal membrane-anchoring domain impaired its ability to prevent apoptotic death. Replacement of the predicted transmembrane domain of Bcl-2 by a heterologous membrane-anchoring domain restored its antiapoptotic function (Nguyen et al., 32Nguyen M. Branton P.E. Walton P.A. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16521-16524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We speculate that the membrane-anchoring segment within E1B 19 kDa is of importance for targeting and attaching the protein to strategic membrane locations in the cell. Since also Bcl-2 was found to negatively interfere with NF-κB-dependent transactivation (Grimm et al., 21Grimm S. Bauer M.K.A. Baeuerle P.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that the NF-κB inhibiting properties of E1B 19 kDa could possibly be assigned to the action of 19 kDa-interacting proteins, a common set of cellular proteins interacting with E1B 19 kDa and Bcl-2 (Boyd et al., 7Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramanian T. Venkatesh L.K. Schaeper U. Elangovan B. D'Sa E.C. Chinnadurai G. Cell. 1994; 79: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, the mutant E1B 19 kDa 50,51 EF-AS, which is incapable of interacting with all three 19 kDa-interacting proteins cloned so far, still inhibits NF-κB transcription. This suggests that the NF-κB inhibiting activity of E1B 19 kDa cannot be assigned to the action of 19 kDa-interacting protein 1 to 3. A possible mechanism for the NF-κB inhibiting activity of E1B 19 kDa is provided by the comparison of several KB cell lines. KB 18 cells, which constitutively express E1B 19 kDa, have an increased level of manganous superoxide dismutase in comparison with wild-type KB cells (Hashimoto et al., 22Hashimoto S. Ishii A. Yonehara S. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Since the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates is common to all inducers of NF-κB, the increased production of manganous superoxide dismutase would impair NF-κB activity, such as does the overexpression of the antioxidative enzymes thioredoxin and catalase (Schmidt et al., 38Schmidt K.N.

INTRODUCTIONAdenoviruses are widespread in vertebrates and have been isolated from amphibians to humans. Human adenoviruses cause a variety of diseases affecting the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tract and the ocular system (Evans, 15Evans A.S. Am. J. Hyg. 1958; 67: 256-629PubMed Google Scholar; Fox et al., 17Fox J.P. Hall C.E. Cooney M.K. Am. J. Epidemiol. 1977; 105: 362-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Adenoviruses of the subgenus C, including Ad 2, Ad 5, and Ad 7, 1The abbreviations used are: AdadenovirusCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusLTRlong terminal repeatNK cellsnatural killer cellsPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateTNF-αtumor necrosis factor αILinterleukinRSVRous sarcoma virus. often cause diseases of the respiratory tract. The viral genome is a linear, double-stranded DNA molecule encoding at least 30 genes. The left 11% of the adenovirus genome comprises early region 1, which encodes the transcriptional units for the regulatory proteins E1A and E1B (Akusjärvi, 1Akusjärvi G.

Virology. 1991; 184: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).The E1A region codes for two major proteins of 243 (12S) and 289 (13S) amino acids length which have transforming activity. E1A proteins were also found to regulate transcription of some viral and cellular promoters (Akusjärvi, 1Akusjärvi G. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 163-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the absence of any apparent DNA binding activity, these transcriptional effects are due to the association of E1A to some host proteins, including the transcription factors ATF-2, Oct-4, and Sp1 (Schöler et al., 42Schöler H.R. Ciesiolka T. Gruss P. Cell. 1991; 66: 291-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar; Liu and Green, 29Liu F. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 368: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Furthermore the E1A protein can activate cell proliferation and induce apoptosis via a p53-mediated pathway (Debbas and White, 12Debbas M. White E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar; White, 56White E. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1993; 204: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).The E1B-encoding mRNA encodes two major unrelated proteins of 19 and 55 kDa molecular mass, respectively. Viral mutants lacking E1B give rise to large clear plaques on infected cell monolayers and are strongly defective in neoplastic transformation (Chinnadurai, 9Chinnadurai G. Cell. 1983; 33: 759-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The absence of the E1B 19 kDa during the productive infection of human cells induces the degradation of host and viral DNA as well as an enhanced cytopathic effect (Ezoe et al., 16Ezoe H. Laifatt R.B. Mak S. J. Virol. 1981; 40: 20-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Pilder et al., 35Pilder S. Logan J. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 664-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Subramanian et al., 1984a46Subramanian T. Kuppuswamy M. Gysbers J. Mak S. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259 (a): 11777-11783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 1984b47Subramanian T. Kuppuswamy M. Mak S. Chinnadurai G. J. Virol. 1984; 52 (b): 336-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; White et al., 1984a59White E. Blose S.H. Stillman B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4 (a): 2865-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 1984b60White E. Grodzicker T. Stillman B.W. J. Virol. 1984; 52 (b): 410-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both splice variants of E1B were found to strongly cooperate with E1A in cell transformation. This supportive effect of E1B in transformation is most likely due to its antiapoptotic properties (Rao et al., 36Rao L. Debbas M. Sabbatini P. Hockenberry D. Korsmeyer S. White E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7742-7746Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). This idea is reinforced by the finding that adenoviruses defective in E1B can be functionally complemented by the cellular Bcl-2 gene, which also acts as an inhibitor of apoptosis (Tarodi et al., 50Tarodi B. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Int. J. Oncol. 1993; 3: 467-472PubMed Google Scholar; Chiou et al., 10Chiou S.K. Tseng C.C. Rao L. White E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6553-6566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the functional complementation of E1B 19 kDa by Bcl-2 proteins in the inhibition of apoptosis, both proteins are membrane-anchored, contain three short regions with sequence similarity, and interact with a common set of cellular proteins (Boyd et al., 7Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramanian T. Venkatesh L.K. Schaeper U. Elangovan B. D'Sa E.C. Chinnadurai G. Cell. 1994; 79: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Both splice variants of E1B inhibit cell death induced by different apoptotic stimuli, such as E1A, the anti-cancer drug cisplatin, TNF-α, or Fas antigen, although the E1B 19 kDa protein does so more effectively (Gooding et al., 18Gooding"
