https://openalex.org/W4281783912,"Neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab induces high pathologic response rates (pRRs) in clinical stage III nodal melanoma, and pathologic response is strongly associated with prolonged relapse-free survival (RFS). The PRADO extension cohort of the OpACIN-neo trial ( NCT02977052 ) addressed the feasibility and effect on clinical outcome of using pathologic response after neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab as a criterion for further treatment personalization. In total, 99 patients with clinical stage IIIb-d nodal melanoma were included and treated with 6 weeks of neoadjuvant ipilimumab 1 mg kg-1 and nivolumab 3 mg kg-1. In patients achieving major pathologic response (MPR, ≤10% viable tumor) in their index lymph node (ILN, the largest lymph node metastasis at baseline), therapeutic lymph node dissection (TLND) and adjuvant therapy were omitted. Patients with pathologic partial response (pPR; >10 to ≤50% viable tumor) underwent TLND only, whereas patients with pathologic non-response (pNR; >50% viable tumor) underwent TLND and adjuvant systemic therapy ± synchronous radiotherapy. Primary objectives were confirmation of pRR (ILN, at week 6) of the winner neoadjuvant combination scheme identified in OpACIN-neo; to investigate whether TLND can be safely omitted in patients achieving MPR; and to investigate whether RFS at 24 months can be improved for patients achieving pNR. ILN resection and ILN-response-tailored treatment were feasible. The pRR was 72%, including 61% MPR. Grade 3-4 toxicity within the first 12 weeks was observed in 22 (22%) patients. TLND was omitted in 59 of 60 patients with MPR, resulting in significantly lower surgical morbidity and better quality of life. The 24-month relapse-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival rates were 93% and 98% in patients with MPR, 64% and 64% in patients with pPR, and 71% and 76% in patients with pNR, respectively. These findings provide a strong rationale for randomized clinical trials testing response-directed treatment personalization after neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab."
https://openalex.org/W4281664504,"The liver carries a remarkable ability to regenerate rapidly after acute zonal damage. Single-cell approaches are necessary to study this process, given the spatial heterogeneity of liver cell types. Here, we use spatially resolved single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study the dynamics of mouse liver regeneration after acute acetaminophen (APAP) intoxication. We find that hepatocytes proliferate throughout the liver lobule, creating the mitotic pressure required to repopulate the necrotic pericentral zone rapidly. A subset of hepatocytes located at the regenerating front transiently upregulate fetal-specific genes, including Afp and Cdh17, as they reprogram to a pericentral state. Zonated endothelial, hepatic stellate cell (HSC), and macrophage populations are differentially involved in immune recruitment, proliferation, and matrix remodeling. We observe massive transient infiltration of myeloid cells, yet stability of lymphoid cell abundance, in accordance with a global decline in antigen presentation. Our study provides a resource for understanding the coordinated programs of zonal liver regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W4281651590,"Our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms surrounding human embryo implantation and gastrulation is lacking, largely due to technical and ethical limitations of experimenting with human embryos. Alternatives to human embryos have been reported, in which 3D clusters of embryonic stem cells are differentiated in a stepwise manner to model aspects of human embryogenesis. Yet it remains challenging to model the events past attachment. We propose a strategy of modeling the post-attachment human embryo by assembling a pre-formed polarized epithelial epiblast and extraembryonic cells, allowing them to self-organize into a structure that mimics the dish-attached human embryo. The model attaches in vitro and, in the absence of exogenous morphogens, breaks anteroposterior symmetry, giving rise to early gastrulation cell types. Our assembloid approach enables in a modular way to upgrade or exchange extraembryonic tissues to access more advanced stages of post-attachment development while complying with ethical policies."

Tauopathies are adult-onset, neurodegenerative disorders whose shared pathology is intracellular tau protein aggregates (Gao et al ., 2018Gao Y.-L. Wang N. Sun F.-R. Cao X.-P. Zhang W. Yu J.-T.

Tau, encoded by the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) gene, produces six protein isoforms whose expression is under strict developmental regulation, with only one isoform (0N3R) present during fetal development but all six present perinatally and maintained throughout the life span (Goedert, and Jakes, 1990Goedert M.

Biol. 1989; 9: 1381-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Tau isoforms are defined by the inclusion or exclusion of three alternatively spliced exons: 2, 3, and 10. Exons 2 and 3 inclusion produces two N-terminal domains (N1 and N2), whereas exon 10 encodes the second imperfect-repeat microtubule-binding domain (R2) among three other repeat domains (R1, R3, and R4) (Goedert et al., 1989aGoedert M.

The inclusion or exclusion of exon 10 gives rise to 4-repeat (4R) and 3-repeat (3R) tau, respectively, and these two isoform families are expressed at an approximately 1:1 ratio in the healthy adult human brain (Goedert et al., 1989aGoedert M.

Perturbation of the 3R:4R tau ratio contributes to the pathogenesis of various tauopathies, and of the 53 known familial pathogenic tau mutations, almost 50% are located within or related to the expression of exon 10 (Ghetti et al., 2015Ghetti B.

Thus, it is critical to establish a human neuron-based system that recapitulates the endogenous tau isoforms seen in the adult brain and tau pathology resulting from 3R:4R dysregulation in patient-derived neurons. The significance of human neuron-based approaches is also highlighted by the fact that humanized mouse tau models lack the 1:1 3R:4R ratio and requires genetic perturbation to achieve 3R:4R tau level comparable with the adult human brain (Duff et al., 2000Duff K.

The past decade has primarily used neuronal differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as the primary methodology for generating human neurons (iPSC-Ns). Although these cells offer a robust means to generate neurons at a large quantity, their utility in studying processes that occur in aged neurons has been limited due to the reversion of the cellular age, and previous studies revealed that iPSC-Ns represent fetal stages of development (Lapasset et al., 2011Lapasset L.

To increase 4R tau levels in iPSC-Ns, several experimental perturbations have been used, including transgene overexpression (Verheyen et al., 2015Verheyen A. Diels A. Dijkmans J. Oyelami T.

However, these experimental manipulations still fall short of generating neurons with the endogenous ratio of 3R:4R in the adult human brain. Only the immortalized human neural progenitor ReNcells, after differentiation into a neuronal population, have expressed 4R tau mRNA along with 3R tau (Choi et al., 2014Choi S.H. Kim Y.H. Hebisch M.

ReNcells serve as a model for human neurons but will have to be engineered to carry known human tau mutations. Therefore, an alternative strategy to generate human neurons that mirror the endogenous tau expression and harbor familial mutations will greatly increase the ability to study tauopathies. Brain-enriched microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-9/9∗ and miR-124 (miR-9/9∗-124) are potent neurogenic miRNAs whose expression is present in fetal and adult brain. During neural development, these miRNAs regulate cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation (Lim et al., 2005Lim L.P. Lau N.C. Garrett-Engele P. Grimson A. Schelter J.M. Castle J. Bartel D.P.

When ectopically expressed in human adult fibroblasts, miR-9/9∗-124 can directly convert fibroblasts to neurons (miNs) (Lu, and Yoo, 2018Lu Y.-L. Yoo A.S.

The miRNA-induced neuronal state can be synergized with subtype-defining transcription factors (TFs) that guide conversion to specific neuronal subtypes (Abernathy et al., 2017Abernathy D.G. Kim W.K.

During reprogramming, miRNAs first instruct cell cycle exit and fibroblast identity erasure, followed by the neuronal program activation in sequence (Cates et al., 202 1Cates K. Mccoy M.J. Kwon J.S.

This property in turn allows for the maintenance of the epigenetic age signature of fibroblast donors (Huh et al., 2016Huh C.J. Zhang B. Victor M.B. Dahiya S. Batista L.F. Horvath S. Yoo A.S.

Additionally, modeling adult-onset disorders using miNs derived from symptomatic Huntington’s disease patients exhibited hallmark adult-onset pathologies such as Huntingtin inclusion bodies, whereas their iPSC-N counterparts failed to do so (Victor et al., 2018Victor M.B. Richner M. Olsen H.E. Lee S.W. Monteys A.M. Ma C. Huh C.J. Zhang B. Davidson B.L. Yang X.W. Yoo A.S.

Here, we reveal that miRNA-mediated direct reprogramming generates human neurons that express both 3R and 4R tau in the same ratio detected in adult human brains. RNA profiling by transcript assays and protein profiling by mass spectrometry demonstrates that adult human brain and miNs from adult fibroblasts have indistinguishable 4R tau profiles, which starkly contrasts with the low 4R tau expression in primary fetal human neurons and iPSC-Ns. The endogenous tau isoform regulation in miNs is sensitive to a point mutation within the splice site proximal to exon 10 in tauopathy patients resulting in reprogrammed neurons that showed increased 4R:3R tau ratio. Significantly, the increased level of 4R tau correlated with the formation of insoluble tau and seed-competent tau, reminiscent of that seen in human 4R tauopathies, and contrasting the lack of seed-competent tau seen in iPSC-Ns harboring the same patient mutation. Therefore, miRNA-mediated neuronal reprogramming provides a robust model for studying both the normal and abnormal biology of tau and exon 10 pathological mutations. In this study, we adapted the neuronal conversion protocol based on miR-9/9∗-124, neuronal differentiation 2 (NEUROD2), and myelin transcription factor 1-like (MYT1L) TFs to generate neurons of cortical lineage (Yoo et al., 2011Yoo A.S.

To minimize the number of lentiviruses used for transduction in fibroblasts, we replaced NEUROD2 with ISX9, a neurogenic compound that has been previously shown to activate endogenous NEUROD-family TFs (Li et al., 2015Li X.

At 30 days post-induction (PID 30), immunostaining for pan-neuronal marker neuronal cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) showed a robust reprogramming output with miNs displaying extensive process outgrowths (Figure 1A left, bottom-left: zoomed in view of NCAM1 expression). The reprogrammed cells were also enriched for other pan-neuronal markers, microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) (Figure 1A, bottom-right), and neurofilament heavy chain (Figure 1A, right). Beta III tubulin (TUBB3) was used to monitor cell morphologies. Importantly, immunostaining against tau revealed the miN population highly enriched with tau expression showing prototypical patterns of tau islands in TUBB3-positive outer neurites (Figure 1B), an endogenous tau feature suggested to be reflective of tau-tau interactions (Siahaan et al., 2019Siahaan V.

Also, qPCR analyses of the cortical markers TBR1 (T-box brain TF 1), MEF2C (myocyte enhancer factor 2C), BRN2 (POU class 3 homeobox 2), and NEUROD2 demonstrated that the combination of MYT1L and ISX9 are sufficient to drive the cortical fate (Figure 1E). Using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to stratify starting fibroblasts (n = 2,533), reprogrammed miNs (n = 9,305), and iPSC-Ns (n = 7,212) by their transcriptome, we identified three distinct cell populations corresponding to fibroblasts, miNs, and iPSC-Ns (Figure 1F, left). For instance, the non-neuronal marker SERPINE1 (Docagne et al., 1999Docagne F. Nicole O. Marti H.H. Mackenzie E.T. Buisson A. Vivien D.

Additionally, miNs were characterized by the high expression of SLC17A7 (VGLUT1), whereas iPSC-Ns were positive for SLC17A6 (VGLUT2) (Figures S1A–S1C). MiNs and iPSC-Ns expressed different glutamate receptor subunits, but both were highly enriched for the glutamine synthetase, GLUL. GAD1 and GAD2 were present in a subset of miNs and iPSC-Ns, respectively. However, the expression of GABA transporter SLC6A1, representing inhibitory cell fate, was only marginal. MiNs showed a low number of PVALB-positive cells, whereas iPSC-Ns had small populations of SST and TH positive cells. Together, these results support the notion that miNs robustly acquire a neuronal fate due to miRNA-mediated reprogramming. ScRNA-seq revealed that age-associated markers as main drivers for distinct segregation of miNs and iPSC-Ns. For instance, miNs were positive for the advanced-age markers CDKN1A (p21), CDKN2A (p16), BAG3, and CAV1 (Figure 2A).

https://openalex.org/W4281617860,"Abstract Germline BRCA1/2 mutation status is predictive for response to Poly-[ADP-Ribose]-Polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in breast cancer (BC) patients. However, non-germline BRCA1/2 mutated and homologous recombination repair deficient (HRD) tumors are likely also PARP-inhibitor sensitive. Clinical validity and utility of various HRD biomarkers are under investigation. The REpair CAPacity (RECAP) test is a functional method to select HRD tumors based on their inability to form RAD51 foci. We investigated whether this functional test defines a similar group of HRD tumors as DNA-based tests. An HRD enriched cohort ( n = 71; 52 primary and 19 metastatic BCs) selected based on the RECAP test (26 RECAP-HRD; 37%), was subjected to DNA-based HRD tests (i.e., Classifier of HOmologous Recombination Deficiency (CHORD) and BRCA1/2-like classifier). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out for 38 primary and 19 metastatic BCs. The RECAP test identified all bi-allelic BRCA deficient samples ( n = 15) in this cohort. RECAP status partially correlated with DNA-based HRD test outcomes (70% concordance for both RECAP-CHORD and RECAP-BRCA1/2-like classifier). RECAP selected additional samples unable to form RAD51 foci, suggesting that this functional assay identified deficiencies in other DNA repair genes, which could also result in PARP-inhibitor sensitivity. Direct comparison of these HRD tests in clinical trials will be required to evaluate the optimal predictive test for clinical decision making."
https://openalex.org/W4281966819,"Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is a major commensal bacterium of the skin and mucosae of dogs and an opportunistic agent responsible for several clinical infections, such as pyoderma, otitis, and surgical wound infections. The emergence of methicillin-resistant S . pseudintermedius (MRSP) has become a problem of great concern in veterinary and human medicine because it is multidrug resistant (MDR) and can also infect humans. This study aimed to identify the occurrence of Staphylococcus spp. in infected patients and investigate the antimicrobial resistance profiles and molecular structure of MRSP isolates. Samples were obtained from two different veterinary clinics; suggestive colonies were submitted to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry and confirmed at the species level by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sequencing of the 16S rRNA and rpoB genes were used in selected samples that were not identified by MALDI-ToF and by the species-specific PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility and PCR detection of mecA were performed. MRSP isolates were subjected to multilocus sequence typing. Of all the clinical staphylococci (n = 131), 98 (74.8%) were identified as S . pseudintermedius . Multidrug resistance (resistance to ≥3 classes of antimicrobials) was observed in 63.2% of S . pseudintermedius isolates, and 24.5% of S . pseudintermedius isolates were methicillin-resistant. Half of the MRSP isolates were isolated from surgical site infections. Among the ten sequence types (ST) identified, nine were novel. ST71 was the most prevalent and associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones. Prior antimicrobial therapy, hospitalization, and surgical site infections seemed to be risk factors for MRSP acquisition. The present study showed a high rate of MDR staphylococci in infected dogs. MRSP was isolated from different clinical conditions, mainly surgical site infections. Additionally, this is the first study to extensively investigate the population structure of MRSP in Brazil, which revealed the dispersion of CC71 and nine novel ST. These findings raise concerns for both animal and human health due to the zoonotic potential of this species and limited therapeutic options available for MRSP infections."
https://openalex.org/W4281959427,"Direct utilization of treated effluent from natural treatment systems for irrigation can be challenging on sensitive plants due to high levels of salinity. Post-treatment of such an effluent prior to its applicability in irrigation can be of significant importance. In this study, the wastewater from a natural treatment plant was treated using a lab-scale filtration system with zeolite as a filter material. Three different column depths (0.5 m, 0.75 m, and 1 m) were used to investigate the effect of column depth on the treatment efficiency of the media. The suitability of the raw wastewater and the treated effluent from each column for irrigation purposes was investigated. The water quality parameters investigated were; electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), and magnesium (Mg2+). From the analysis results, it was observed that the column depth had a significant influence on the removal efficiency of the pollutants. The highest removal efficiency (94.58%) was achieved from the combination of electrical conductivity and 1 m column depth, while the lowest removal efficiency (10.05%) was observed from the combination of calcium and 0.5 m column depth. The raw wastewater fell mostly into a ""very high"" hazard, which is class four (C4) based on electrical conductivity and class four (S4) based sodium adsorption ratio; making it unsuitable for irrigation purposes. However, when the wastewater was subjected to 1 m column depth, the quality of the treated effluent improved significantly which in turn also improved the suitability of the effluent for irrigation purposes, with percent compliance ranging from 20.19% to 97.54%."

For a minimum of three weeks on each, participants followed two isocaloric diets: a HCLF diet (55%carbohydrate, 20%fat, 25%protein) and a KD (15%carbohydrate, 60%fat, 25% protein), with a one-week washout period in-between. Importantly, while on the KD, the participants were required to remain in a state of nutritional ketosis for three consecutive weeks. Crossover analyses and linear mixed models were used to assess effect of diet on body mass, thyroid function and resting metabolic rate.Both dietary interventions resulted in significant body mass loss (p<0.05) however three weeks of sustained ketosis (KD) resulted in a greater loss of body mass (mean (95%CI): -2.9 (-3.5, -2.4) kg) than did three weeks on the HCLF diet (-0.4 (-1.0, 0.1) kg, p < 0.0001). Compared to pre-diet levels, the change in plasma T3 concentration was significantly different between the two diets (p = 0.003), such that plasma T3 concentration was significantly lower following the KD diet (4.1 (3.8, 4.4) pmol/L, p<0.0001) but not different following the HCLF diet (4.8 (4.5, 5.2) pmol/L, p = 0.171. There was a significant increase in T4 concentration from pre-diet levels following the KD diet (19.3 (17.8, 20.9) pmol/L, p < 0.0001), but not following the HCLF diet (17.3 (15.7, 18.8) pmol.L, p = 0.28). The magnitude of change in plasma T4 concentration was not different between the two diets (p = 0.4). There was no effect of diet on plasma thyroid stimulating hormone concentration (p = 0.27). There was a significantly greater T3:T4 ratio following the HCLF diet (0.41 (0.27, 0.55), p < 0.0001) compared to pre-diet levels but not following the KD diet (0.25 (0.12, 0.39), p = 0.80).Although the diets were isocaloric and physical activity and resting metabolic rate remained constant, the participants lost more mass after the KD than after the HCLF diet. The observed significant changes in triiodothyronine concentration suggest that unknown metabolic changes occur in nutritional ketosis, changes that warrant further investigation.Pan African Clinical Trial Registry: PACTR201707002406306 URL: https://pactr.samrc.ac.za/."

PCSK9 also targets proteins involved in lipid metabolism (very low-density lipoprotein receptor), immunity (major histocompatibility complex I), and viral infection (cluster of differentiation 81). Recent studies have also indicated that PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations are associated with an increased incidence of diabetes; however, the expression and function of PCSK9 in insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells remain unclear. Here, we studied PCSK9 regulation and function by performing loss- and gain-of-function experiments in the human beta cell line EndoC-βH1. We demonstrate that PCSK9 is expressed and secreted by EndoC-βH1 cells. We also found that PCSK9 expression is regulated by cholesterol and sterol regulatory element-binding protein transcription factors, as previously demonstrated in other cell types such as hepatocytes. Importantly, we show that PCSK9 knockdown using siRNA results in deregulation of various elements of the transcriptome, proteome, and secretome, and increases insulin secretion. We also observed that PCSK9 decreases low-density lipoprotein receptor and very low-density lipoprotein receptor levels via an extracellular signaling mechanism involving exogenous PCSK9, as well as levels of cluster of differentiation 36, a fatty acid transporter, through an intracellular signaling mechanism. Finally, we found that PCSK9 regulates the cell surface expression of PDL1 and HLA-ABC, proteins involved in cell-lymphocyte interaction, also via an intracellular mechanism. Collectively, these results highlight PCSK9 as a regulator of multiple cell surface receptors in pancreatic beta cells."

Here, we discovered that TRIM66 and DAX1 function together as negative regulators of the 2C-like state in mESCs. Chimeric assays confirmed that mESCs lacking TRIM66 or DAX1 function have bidirectional embryonic and extraembryonic differentiation potential. TRIM66 functions by recruiting the co-repressor DAX1 to the Dux promoter, and TRIM66's repressive effect on Dux is dependent on DAX1. A solved crystal structural shows that TRIM66's PHD finger recognizes H3K4-K9me3, and mutational evidence confirmed that TRIM66's PHD finger is essential for its repression of Dux. Thus, beyond expanding the scope of known 2CLC regulators, our study demonstrates that interventions disrupting TRIM66 or DAX1 function in mESCs yield 2CLCs with expanded bidirectional differentiation potential, opening doors for the practical application of these totipotent-like cells."

Hypokinetic and ataxic dysarthria are common in movement disorders and represent the underlying neuropathology. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model to distinguish ataxic dysarthria and hypokinetic dysarthria from normal speech and differentiate ataxic and hypokinetic speech in parkinsonian diseases and cerebellar ataxia. We screened 804 perceptual speech analyses performed in the Samsung Medical Center Neurology Department between January 2017 and December 2020. The data of patients diagnosed with parkinsonian disorders or cerebellar ataxia were included. Two speech tasks (numbering from 1 to 50 and reading nine sentences) were analyzed. We adopted convolutional neural networks and developed a patch-wise wave splitting and integrating AI system for audio classification (PWSI-AI-AC) to differentiate between ataxic and hypokinetic speech. Of the 395 speech recordings for the reading task, 76, 112, and 207 were from normal, ataxic dysarthria, and hypokinetic dysarthria subjects, respectively. Of the 409 recordings of the numbering task, 82, 111, and 216 were from normal, ataxic dysarthria, and hypokinetic dysarthria subjects, respectively. The reading and numbering task recordings were classified with 5-fold cross-validation using PWSI-AI-AC as follows: hypokinetic dysarthria vs. others (area under the curve: 0.92 ± 0.01 and 0.92 ± 0.02), ataxia vs. others (0.93 ± 0.04 and 0.89 ± 0.02), hypokinetic dysarthria vs. ataxia (0.96 ± 0.02 and 0.95 ± 0.01), hypokinetic dysarthria vs. none (0.86 ± 0.03 and 0.87 ± 0.05), and ataxia vs. none (0.87 ± 0.07 and 0.87 ± 0.09), respectively. PWSI-AI-AC showed reliable performance in differentiating ataxic and hypokinetic dysarthria and effectively augmented data to classify the types even with limited training samples. The proposed fully automatic AI system outperforms neurology residents. Our model can provide effective guidelines for screening related diseases and differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases."

In spite of this, the body of literature that accounts for the sex of participants in human locomotion studies is small and often produces controversial results. Here, we investigated the modular organization of muscle activation patterns for human locomotion using the concept of muscle synergies with a double purpose: i) uncover possible sex-specific characteristics of motor control and ii) assess whether these are maintained in older age. We recorded electromyographic activities from 13 ipsilateral muscles of the lower limb in young and older adults of both sexes walking (young and old) and running (young) on a treadmill. The data set obtained from the 215 participants was elaborated through non-negative matrix factorization to extract the time-independent (i.e., motor modules) and time-dependent (i.e., motor primitives) coefficients of muscle synergies. We found sparse sex-specific modulations of motor control. Motor modules showed a different contribution of hip extensors, knee extensors and foot dorsiflexors in various synergies. Motor primitives were wider (i.e., lasted longer) in males in the propulsion synergy for walking (but only in young and not in older adults) and in the weight acceptance synergy for running. Moreover, the complexity of motor primitives was similar in younger adults of both sexes, but lower in older females as compared to older males. In essence, our results revealed the existence of small but defined sex-specific differences in the way humans control locomotion and that these are not entirely maintained in older age."

Surveys to characterize the composition of grapevine trunk diseases have been conducted for most major grape growing regions of the world. This study presents a similar survey characterizing the fungi associated with grapevine trunk diseases of cold-hardy interspecific hybrid grape varieties grown nearly exclusively in the atypical harsh winter climate of Northern Midwestern United states vineyards. From the 172 samples collected in 2019, 640 isolates obtained by culturing were identified by ITS sequencing and represent 420 sample-unique taxa. From the 420 representative taxa, opportunistic fungi of the order Diaporthales including species of Cytospora and Diaporthe were most frequently identified. Species of Phaeoacremonium, Paraconiothyrium, and Cadophora were also prevalent. In other milder Mediterranean growing climates, species of Xylariales and Botryosphaeriales are often frequently isolated but in this study they were isolated in small numbers. No Phaeomoniellales taxa were isolated. We discuss the possible compounding effects of winter injury, the pathogens isolated, and management strategies.

However, the roles and regulatory mechanisms maintaining stemness among breast cancer subtypes remain elusive. Our previous studies have demonstrated that ectopic expression and dynamic alteration of the mesenchymal transcription factor forkhead box F2 (FOXF2) differentially regulates breast cancer progression and metastasis organotropism in a cell subtype-specific manner. Here, we reveal the underlying mechanism by which FOXF2 enhances stemness in luminal breast cancer cells but suppresses that in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cells. We show that luminal breast cancer and BLBC cells with FOXF2-regulated stemness exhibit partial mesenchymal stem cell properties that toward osteogenic differentiation and myogenic differentiation, respectively. Furthermore, we show that FOXF2 activates the Wnt signaling pathway in luminal breast cancer cells but represses this pathway in BLBC cells by recruiting nuclear receptor coactivator 3 (NCoA3) and nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) to the promoters of Wnt family member 2B (WNT2B) and frizzled class receptor 1 (FZD1) genes to activate and repress their transcription, respectively. We propose that targeting the Wnt signaling pathway is a promising strategy for the treatment of breast cancers with dysregulated expression of FOXF2."

We examined mitochondrial mechanisms supporting adaptive increases in aerobic performance in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) adapted to the hypoxic environment at high altitude. High-altitude and low-altitude mice were born and raised in captivity, and exposed as adults to normoxia or hypobaric hypoxia (12 kPa O2 for 6-8 weeks). Subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar mitochondria were isolated from the gastrocnemius, and a comprehensive substrate titration protocol was used to examine mitochondrial physiology and O2 kinetics by high-resolution respirometry and fluorometry. High-altitude mice had greater yield, respiratory capacity for oxidative phosphorylation, and O2 affinity (lower P50 ) of subsarcolemmal mitochondria compared to low-altitude mice across environments, but there were no species difference in these traits in intermyofibrillar mitochondria. High-altitude mice also had greater capacities of complex II relative to complexes I + II and higher succinate dehydrogenase activities in both mitochondrial fractions. Exposure to chronic hypoxia reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission in high-altitude mice but not in low-altitude mice. Our findings suggest that functional changes in subsarcolemmal mitochondria contribute to improving aerobic performance in hypoxia in high-altitude deer mice. Therefore, physiological variation in specific mitochondrial fractions can help overcome the metabolic challenges of life at high altitude."

Dedicator of cytokinesis 11 (DOCK11), known as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42, is reported to be essential for the maintenance of HBV. However, potential therapeutic strategies targeting DOCK11 have not yet been explored. We have previously developed an in vitro virus method as a more efficient tool for the analysis of proteomics and evolutionary protein engineering. In this study, using the in vitro virus method, we screened and identified a novel antiasialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR) antibody, ASGR3-10M, and a DOCK11-binding peptide, DCS8-42A, for potential use in HBV infection. We further constructed a fusion protein (10M-D42AN) consisting of ASGR3-10M, DCS8-42A, a fusogenic peptide, and a nuclear localization signal to deliver the peptide inside hepatocytes. We show using immunofluorescence staining that 10M-D42AN was endocytosed into early endosomes and released into the cytoplasm and nucleus. Since DCS8-42A shares homology with activated cdc42-associated kinase 1 (Ack1), which promotes EGFR endocytosis required for HBV infection, we also found that 10M-D42AN inhibited endocytosis of EGFR and Ack1. Furthermore, we show 10M-D42AN suppressed the function of DOCK11 in the host DNA repair system required for covalently closed circular DNA synthesis and suppressed HBV proliferation in mice. In conclusion, this study realizes a novel hepatocyte-specific drug delivery system using an anti-ASGR antibody, a fusogenic peptide, and DOCK11-binding peptide to provide a novel treatment for HBV."

Multivariable linear mixed models were used to test for associations between fasting glucose and 7.9 million SNPs, with adjustment for age, body mass index (BMI), sex, significant principal components of the genotypes, and cryptic relatedness. Three previously discovered loci were genome-wide significant, with the lead SNPs being rs1260326, a missense variant in GCKR ( p = 1.06×10 −8 ); rs560887, an intronic variant in G6PC2 ( p = 3.39×10 −11 ); and rs13266634, a missense variant in SLC30A8 ( p = 4.28×10 −10 ). Fine mapping, genome-wide conditional analysis, and functional annotation indicated that the three loci were independently associated with fasting glucose. Each copy of an alternate allele at any of these three SNPs was associated with a reduction of 0.012 mmol/L in fasting glucose levels ( p = 8.0×10 −28 ), and this association was replicated in trans-ethnic analysis of 14,303 individuals ( p = 2.2×10 −16 ). The three SNPs were jointly associated with significantly reduced T2D risk, with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 0.93 (0.88, 0.98) per protective allele. Our findings implicate additive effects across pathophysiological pathways involved in type 2 diabetes, including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and insulin secretion. Since none of the individuals homozygous for the alternate alleles at all three loci has T2D, it might be possible to use a genetic predictor of fasting glucose levels to identify individuals at low vs . high risk of developing type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4281622579,"Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) is a cost-effective approach for improving the quality of clinical care and implementing only well-tested evidence. Health professions, especially physiotherapy, must embrace EBP principles. This paper presents normative data from the Spanish physiotherapist population using the Health-Sciences Evidence-Based Practice questionnaire and explores EBP clusters/profiles of professionals in practice. An intentional sample of 419 practicing physiotherapists was recruited from the Spanish Professional Council of Physiotherapy. Participants completed a cross-sectional online survey with 60 Likert items (scale 1-10) measuring 5 dimensions: 1) Beliefs and attitudes, 2) Results from literature, 3) Professional practice, 4) Assessment of results, and 5) Barriers and Facilitators. The protocol also included sociodemographic, training, and practice-related contrast variables. Normative data were estimated and tabulated for each dimension and then a K-means clustering procedure was implemented using the contrast variables. Results for normative data showed, in descending order, the following 50th percentile values for the five EBP factors: Beliefs and attitudes (8.25), Professional practice (8.00), Assessment of results (7.42), Results from literature (6.71), and EBP Barriers and Facilitators (5.17); all expressed on a scale of 1 to 10. Academic degree, EBP training level, and work time shared in healthcare activity, research, or teaching activity were all statistically significant for discriminating EBP dimension scores. Finally, six different clusters showed that when EBP level is low, the scores in all dimensions are equally low, and vice-versa. The EBP dimensions ""Beliefs and attitudes"", ""Professional practice"", and ""Evaluation of results"" obtained better normative scores overall than ""Search for bibliographic evidence and its inclusion in practice"" and especially ""Perception of EBP barriers"", which had the worst score. Normative data are useful for comparing individual scores and the reference population, and information about clusters will enable appropriate global EBP intervention programs to be designed and implemented."

To address the unmet need of organ shortage, descemetorhexis without endothelial keratoplasty has been specifically employed to treat early stage Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy, which is pathophysiologically related to oxidative stress and exhibits centrally located corneal guttae. After stripping off central Descemet's membrane, rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor has been found to facilitate CEC migration, an energy-demanding task, thereby achieving wound closure. However, the correlation between ROCK inhibition and the change in bioenergetic status of CECs remained to be elucidated. Through transcriptomic profiling, we found that the inhibition of ROCK activity by the selective inhibitor, ripasudil or Y27632, promoted enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) gene set in bovine CECs (BCECs). Functional analysis revealed that ripasudil, a clinically approved anti-glaucoma agent, enhanced mitochondrial respiration, increased spare respiratory capacity, and induced overexpression of electron transport chain components through upregulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Accelerated BCEC migration and in vitro wound healing by ripasudil were diminished by OXPHOS and AMPK inhibition, but not by glycolysis inhibition. Correspondingly, lamellipodial protrusion and actin assembly that were augmented by ripasudil became reduced with additional OXPHOS or AMPK inhibition. These results indicate that ROCK inhibition induces metabolic reprogramming toward OXPHOS to support migration of CECs."
https://openalex.org/W4281640385,"This article discusses the socioeconomic dynamics of metal consumption patterns in the 3rd millennium BC north-central Anatolian site of Resuloğlu (Çorum, Turkey). The socio-political structure of the site confirms a nonstate, socially complex community with a range of hierarchical and heterarchical expressions. This study presents the results of archaeological, compositional (n = 307), and isotopic (n = 45) analyses of the complete metal collection of Resuloğlu uncovered through two decades of systematic excavations with a well-established chronology. The elemental compositions of metal objects obtained with pXRF combined with lead isotope analysis denote a high diversity in alloy types and sources. The compositional analysis highlights the consumption of various binary and ternary alloys for different object types. The lead isotope ratios confirm the use of both in proximity to metallic sources and access to macro-regional trade extending from the Black Sea coast towards the Taurus Mountain range. The site appears as a part of linkages whereby goods and valuables were exchanged within decentralized networks of middle-range societies. The diversity in metal consumption suggests group-driven choices and networks rather than top-down control of social elites. This allows us to confront the conventional approach to the role of metals as the primary motivator for social complexity and inequality in all parts of the 3rd millennium BC Anatolia."

A two-stage sampling technique was used in the selection of hospitals and study participants. The data were collected from the participants using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and analyzed using STATA Release 15. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine syphilis infection determinants. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were used for each explanatory variable with a 95% confidence level. A statistically significant association was declared when a p-value was less than 0.05.A total of 296 (74 cases and 222 controls) pregnant women participated, with a recruitment rate of 97.4%. In multivariate logistic regression, the likelihood of developing a maternal syphilis infection was higher in pregnant women who had more than one-lifetime sexual partner [AOR = 3.59, 95% CI (1.09-11.71)]; a history of sexually transmitted infections [AOR = 3.46, 95%CI (1.32-9.08)] and used a substance [AOR = 3.39, 95%CI (1.31-8.77)].Sexual-related factors continued to be a major determinant of syphilis in pregnant women. The results suggest that there is a need to promote safe sexual behavior, raise awareness about the risk of STIs, and early diagnosis and treatment of STIs to control syphilis infection, and necessary to make the antenatal care service comprehensive for pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W4281672540,"Due to greater environmental awareness, domestic laundry habits are changing, and antimicrobial control by chemical methods has become an essential factor to compensate for the use of lower temperatures during washing machine cycles. Disinfectants added to laundry detergents are a preventive strategy to reduce the transmission of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the home, correct aesthetic damage (e.g., spotting, discolouration, and staining), and control the microbial contamination that leads to malodour. In Europe, disinfectants are regulated by the EU Biocidal Products Regulation (No. 528/2012), which stipulates that antimicrobial efficacy must be evaluated according to standardized methods. Current European standards for laundry sanitization only apply to clinical settings (EN 16616: 2015) and are restricted to the main wash cycle. Therefore, there is a gap in the EU standards regarding the testing of product efficacy in household laundering. With the aim of addressing this gap, an international ring trial was organized to evaluate the robustness of a new method (prEN 17658) designed to test the efficacy of antimicrobial laundry products in a domestic setting. The seven participating laboratories were equipped with 5 different laboratory-scale devices to simulate the washing process, and they evaluated 7 microbial parameters for 2 experimental conditions and 3 levels of active substance. The analysis of data according to ISO 5725–2 and ISO 13528 demonstrated that the method was robust. All reproducibility standard deviation values were between 0.00 and 1.40 and the relative standard deviation indicates satisfactory reproducibility. Values of logarithmic reduction ranged from less than 2 log 10 for tests with water to more than 5 log 10 when disinfectants were added. The evidence generated by the ring trial was presented in a proposal for a standardized method under CEN/TC 216, in which the SOP used in the ring trial is referred to as the prEN 17658 phase 2 step 2 test method covering chemothermal textile disinfection in domestic settings."

In this study, we investigated the effects of hypoxia-related genes on tumor progress to characterize the tumor hypoxic microenvironment.We retrieved a set of hypoxia-related genes from the Molecular Signatures Database and evaluated their prognostic value for cervical cancer. A hypoxia-based prognostic signature for cervical cancer was then developed and validated using tumor samples from two independent cohorts (TCGA-CESC and CGCI-HTMCP-CC cohorts). Finally, we validated the hypoxia prediction of ccHPS score in eight human cervical cancer cell lines treated with the hypoxic and normoxic conditions, and 286 tumor samples with hypoxic category (more or less) from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with accession GSE72723.A risk signature model containing nine hypoxia-related genes was developed and validated in cervical cancer. Further analysis showed that this risk model could be an independent prognosis factor of cervical cancer, which reflects the condition of the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and its remodeling of cell metabolism and tumor immunity. Furthermore, a nomogram integrating the novel risk model and lymphovascular invasion status was developed, accurately predicting the 1-, 3- and 5-year prognosis with AUC values of 0.928, 0.916 and 0.831, respectively. These findings provided a better understanding of the hypoxic tumor microenvironment in cervical cancer and insights into potential new therapeutic strategies in improving cancer therapy."

The finding of an order of COVID-19 deaths in 153 days in Nepal obey the proposed distribution, it has a significantly positive relationship between the predictive test positive rate and the predictive number of deaths per day. Therefore, the intended model is an alternative model for survival data and lifetime data analysis."
https://openalex.org/W4281734647,"Closure of a patent foramen ovale reduces the risk of recurrent stroke compared with medical therapy alone in young patients with cryptogenic strokes revealed by randomized control trials. Some cost-effectiveness analyses outside Japan have shown that patent foramen ovale closure is cost-effective, but no studies have examined cost-effectiveness in Japan. The objective of this study is to assess cost-effectiveness, from the perspective of a Japanese healthcare payer, of patent foramen ovale closure versus medical therapy alone for patients with patent foramen ovale related to cryptogenic strokes.A cost-effectiveness study was conducted by developing a decision tree and a Markov model. Probabilities and a 5.9-year time horizon followed the RESPECT study. Utilities and costs were based upon published studies and assumptions. All assumptions were assessed by experts, including a cardiologist and a statistical expert. The target population comprised patients with cryptogenic stroke and patent foramen ovale, aged 60 years or younger. The model was discounted at 2.0% and its cycle was one month. A willingness-to-pay threshold is set at $50,000 / quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was evaluated. Then one-way sensitivity analyses as deterministic sensitivity analysis, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess data robustness.Incremental quality-adjusted life years, incremental costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were 0.464, $13,562, and $29,208 per QALY gained, respectively. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that the stable state utility score difference between patent foramen ovale closure and medical therapy had the largest impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Patent foramen ovale closure is cost-effective at a stable state utility score difference of >0.051, compared with medical therapy. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that patent foramen ovale closure was 50.3% cost-effective.Patent foramen ovale closure was cost-effective compared with medical therapy for Japanese patients with cryptogenic stroke who were ≤60 years."
https://openalex.org/W4281773051,"Over the past four decades, China's economy has experienced tremendous economic growth but also a widening urban-rural income gap. Given the dilemma of the urban-rural income gap in China explained by neoclassical equilibrium theory, this paper attempts to provide a new theoretical explanation for the large-income gap between urban and rural areas in China. We select data from 30 provinces(cities) in China over the period from 2006 to 2017 as a sample to investigate whether and how the degree of farmland financial innovation narrows the urban-rural income gap. The results show that the coefficient for farmland financial innovation is significantly negative at the 1% level, signifying that financial innovation can narrow the urban-rural income gap in China. The mediation effect test provides evidence that farmland financial innovation narrows the urban-rural income gap by promoting the permanent migration of the labor force and upgrading the industrial structure. Our results indicate that the government should promote various forms of farmland financial innovation, establish rural property rights transaction system and free farmers from deep farmer-land attachment to realize permanent labor migration."
https://openalex.org/W4281913540,"Background Acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is not an uncommon complication of oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy that requires medication cessation. However, drug cessation may cause fatal stroke or systemic embolization in patients at high thromboembolic risk. Here we sought to find an appropriate anticoagulation cessation strategy in cases of GI bleeding during OAC therapy. Methods This single-center retrospective cohort analysis was performed between 2010 and 2018. Patients were enrolled if the following three consecutive conditions were met: 1) electrocardiography electrocardiography-proven atrial fibrillation; 2) OAC therapy; and 3) GI bleeding. We divided the drug cessation strategy into the continuation and discontinuation groups. During 1-year follow-up, the rates of major thromboembolic and rebleeding events were calculated. Results One hundred and forty-six patients (continuation [n = 54] vs. discontinuation [n = 92] group) were enrolled. Patients in the discontinuation group were more likely to be older (69.8 ± 9.0 yrs vs. 74.9 ± 8.9 yrs, p = 0.001), while patients in the continuation group were more likely to have undergone cardiac valve surgery (51.9% vs. 20.7%, p&lt;0.001). The presence of a mechanical mitral valve was a determinant of continuation strategy (38.9% vs. 7.5%, p&lt;0.001). However, the mean CHA₂DS₂-VASc (3.4±1.3 vs. 4.1±1.6, p = 0.010) and Glasgow-Blatchford (8.0±2.4 vs. 8.9±2.5, p = 0.037) scores were higher in the discontinuation group. Two major embolic strokes occurred in each group (3.7% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.585). Four of 54 (7.4%) and five of 92 (5.4%) patients had rebleeding events during follow-up (p = 0.632). One embolic event in the continuation group and one rebleeding event in the discontinuation group were fatal. The Glasgow-Blatchford score was a predictor of 1-year rebleeding events (odds ratio [OR], 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68–2.20; p = 0.028). The high CHA₂DS₂-VASc score showed a strong trend (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 0.92–3.20; p = 0.089) in 1-year thromboembolic events. Conclusion No single risk factor or drug cessation strategy was attributed to adverse clinical events after GI bleeding. The risk of future thrombotic or rebleeding events should be individualized and controlled for based on a pre-existing stratification system."
https://openalex.org/W4281914640,"Abortion is highly stigmatized in the United States which prevents its accurate measurement in surveys. The list experiment aims to improve the reporting of abortion history. We evaluated whether a list experiment resulted in higher reporting of abortion experiences than did two direct questions. Utilizing data from a representative survey of adult women of reproductive age in Ohio, we examined abortion history using two direct questions and a double list experiment. Through the double list experiment, we asked respondents to report how many of two lists of health items they had experienced; one list included abortion. We compared weighted history of abortion between these measures and by respondent demographic characteristics (age and socioeconomic status). Estimates of abortion history were similar between direct and list experiment questions. When measured with the two different direct question of abortion history, 8.4% and 8.0% of all respondents indicated ever having an abortion and with the list experiment, 8.5% indicated ever having an abortion. In a Midwestern state-level survey, the list experiment did not lead to increases in abortion reporting as compared to the direct questions. Subgroup analyses require larger samples, and future iterations should incorporate related but non-stigmatized control items to reduce misclassification and under-powering of such subgroup analyses."
https://openalex.org/W4281633692,"Background Elderly individuals occupy an increasing part of the general population. Conventional and speckle-tracking transthoracic echocardiography may help guide risk stratification in these individuals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential utility of conventional and speckle-tracking echocardiography in the screening of cardiac abnormalities in the elderly population. Methods Two cohorts of elderly individuals (sample size: 1441 and 944) were analyzed, who were part of a randomized controlled clinical trial (LOOP study) and of an observational study (Copenhagen City Heart Study), recruiting participants from the general population &gt;70 years of age with cardiovascular risk factors (arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, or prior stroke) and sinus rhythm. Participants underwent a comprehensive transthoracic echocardiographic examination, including myocardial speckle tracking. Cardiac abnormalities were defined according to the ASE/EACVI guidelines. Results Structural cardiac abnormalities such as left ventricular (LV) remodeling, mitral annular calcification (MAC), and aortic valve sclerosis (with or without stenosis) were highly prevalent in the LOOP study (40%, 39%, and 27%, respectively). Moreover, a high prevalence of functional cardiac alterations such as LV diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), abnormal LV longitudinal systolic strain (GLS), and abnormal left atrial (LA) reservoir strain was present in the LOOP study (27%, 18%, and 9%, respectively). Likewise, the rate of LVDD, abnormal GLS, and abnormal LA reservoir strain was comparable in the validation sample from the Copenhagen City Heart Study. In line with these findings, subjects with LV remodeling, MAC, and aortic valve changes had a higher prevalence of LVDD, abnormal GLS, and abnormal LA reservoir strain than those without structural cardiac alterations. Conclusion The findings of this study highlight the potential clinical utility of conventional and speckle-tracking echocardiography in the screening of structural and functional cardiac abnormalities in the elderly population. Further studies are warranted to determine the prognostic relevance of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W4281651176,"Exposure to organic dust in animal and agricultural farms and the ensuing lung inflammation are linked to the development of respiratory diseases. We found previously that elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by aqueous poultry organic dust extract (hereafter referred to as dust extract) mediates induction of proinflammatory mediators in airway epithelial cells. In the present study, we investigated whether ROS generated by NADPH oxidases (NOX) and xanthine oxidase (XO) controls induction of inflammatory mediators by dust extract and the underlying mechanisms in bronchial epithelial cells. Using chemical inhibitors and siRNA targeted knockdown, we found that NOX1, NOX2, NOX4, and XO-derived ROS regulates induction of proinflammatory mediator levels. Like airway epithelial cells in vitro, NOX inhibitor VAS2870 reduced keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), IL-6, and TNF-α production and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) staining induced by dust extract in mouse lungs. VAS2870 inhibition of proinflammatory mediators was associated with reduced NFκB and Stat3 activation indicating that NOX generated ROS activates NFκB and Stat3 to induce proinflammatory gene expression. Dust extract increased the membrane association of p47phox in airway epithelial cells indicating NOX2 activation but had no effect on NOX2 protein levels. In summary, our studies have shown that NOX and XO generated ROS control organic dust induction of proinflammatory mediators in airway epithelial cells via NFκB and Stat3 activation."

Total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) were also determined. The correlation of TPC, TFC, DPPH, and ABTS in different extracts of Cucurbitaceae vegetables was analyzed. The peel extracts of studied vegetables had the highest TPC, (C. grandis 3.00±0.86, T. cucumerina 3.24±0.70 and C. moschata 3.12±0.06 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) g-1 DW) and TFC (C. grandis 18.96±1.5, T. cucumerina 13.92±1.41 and C. moschata 15.31±0.97 mg rutin equivalent (RE) g-1 DW). The maximum antioxidant potential was obtained by the ABTS method in peel extracts of C. grandis (78.7%) and C. moschata (63.5%) while in pulp extract of T. cucumerina (50.1%) at 10 μg/mL. The percent radical scavenging activity (% RSA) by the DPPH method found maximum for peel and pulp of C. grandis (45.15 and 45.15%, respectively) and peel of T. cucumerina (45.15%) and C. moschata (34.15%). The EC50 obtained in the ABTS method was 0.54 and 7.15 μg/mL for C. grandis and C. moschata, respectively while 0.81 μg/mL for the pulp of T. cucumerina compared to standard ascorbic acid (1.05 μg/mL). The EC50 calculated in the DPPH method was 11.78 μg/mL, 13.34 μg/mL, and 21.00 μg/mL for C. grandis, T. cucumerina, and C. moschata peel respectively compared to the standard Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT).

The benefit of exercise training (ET) for MetS treatment is already well defined in the literature, but the antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic benefits of okra (O) have been discovered only recently. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of O and/or ET supplementation on renal function and histology; serum urea and creatinine value; inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α) and oxidative stress in renal tissue. For this, 32 Zucker rats (fa/fa) were randomly separated into four groups of 8 animals each: Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), MetS + Okra (MetS + O), MetS + Exercise Training (MetS + ET), and MetS + Exercise Training and Okra (MetS + ET + O), and 8 Zucker lean (fa/+) rats comprised the Control group (CTL). Okra was administered by orogastric gavage 2x/day (morning and night, 100 mg/kg) and ET performed on the treadmill, at moderate intensity, 1h/day, 5x/week for 6 weeks. Although the renal function was not altered, the animals with MetS showed greater fibrotic deposition accompanied by a worse stage of renal injury, in addition to increased kidney weight. Although all interventions were beneficial in reducing fibrosis, only ET combined with O was able to improve the degree of renal tissue impairment. ET improved the anti-inflammatory status and reduced nitrite levels, but the combination of ET and O was more beneficial as regards catalase activity. Okra consumption alone did not promote changes in inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress in the kidney. In conclusion, ET combined or not with O seems to be beneficial in preventing the progression of renal disease when renal function is not yet altered."
https://openalex.org/W4281737082,"Accelerated epigenetic ageing, a promising marker of disease risk, has been detected in peripheral blood cells of atherosclerotic patients, but evidence in the vascular wall is lacking. Understanding the trends of epigenetic ageing in the atheroma may provide insights into mechanisms of atherogenesis or identify targets for molecular therapy. We surveyed DNA methylation age in two human artery samples: a set of donor-matched, paired atherosclerotic and healthy aortic portions, and a set of carotid artery atheromas. The well-characterized pan-tissue Horvath epigenetic clock was used, together with the Weidner whole-blood-specific clock as validation. For the first time, we document dynamic DNA methylation age mosaicism of the vascular wall that is atherosclerosis-related, switches from acceleration to deceleration with chronological ageing, and is consistent in human aorta and carotid atheroma. At CpG level, the Horvath epigenetic clock showed modest differential methylation between atherosclerotic and healthy aortic portions, weak association with atheroma histological grade and no clear evidence for participation in atherosclerosis-related cellular pathways. Our data suggest caution when assigning a unidirectional DNA methylation age change to the atherosclerotic arterial wall. Also, the results support previous conclusions that epigenetic ageing reflects non-disease-specific cellular alterations."
https://openalex.org/W4281739880,"Ascl2 has been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC), although its epigenetic regulatory mechanism is largely unknown. Here, we found that methylation of the Ascl2 promoter (bp -1670 ∼ -1139) was significantly increased compared to the other regions of the Ascl2 locus in CRC cells and was associated with elevated Ascl2 mRNA expression. Furthermore, we found that promoter methylation was predictive of CRC patient survival after analyzing DNA methylation data, RNA-Seq data, and clinical data of 410 CRC patient samples from the MethHC database, the MEXPRESS database, and the Cbioportal website. Using the established TET methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) knockdown and ectopic TET2 catalytic domain-expression cell models, we performed glucosylated hydroxymethyl-sensitive quatitative PCR (qPCR), real-time PCR, and Western blot assays to further confirm that hypermethylation of the Ascl2 promoter, and elevated Ascl2 expression in CRC cells was partly due to the decreased expression of TET2. Furthermore, BCLAF1 was identified as a TET2 interactor in CRC cells by LC-MS/MS, coimmunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence colocalization, and proximity ligation assays. Subsequently, we found the TET2-BCLAF1 complex bound to multiple elements around CCGG sites at the Ascl2 promoter and further restrained its hypermethylation by inducing its hydroxymethylation using chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and glucosylated hydroxymethyl-qPCR assays. Finally, we demonstrate that TET2-modulated Ascl2-targeted stem gene expression in CRC cells was independent of Wnt signaling. Taken together, our data suggest an additional option for inhibiting Ascl2 expression in CRC cells through TET2-BCLAF1-mediated promoter methylation, Ascl2-dependent self-renewal of CRC progenitor cells, and TET2-BCLAF1-related CRC progression."
https://openalex.org/W4281747473,"Background Older adults aged 65 years and above have a disproportionately higher utilization of emergency healthcare, of which Emergency Department (ED) visits are a key component. They experience higher degree of multimorbidity and mobility issues compared to younger patients, and are consequently more likely to experience a health event which requires an ED visit. During their visit, older adults tend to require more extensive workup, therefore spending a greater amount of time in the ED. Compared to the younger population, older adults are more susceptible to adverse events following discharge. Considering these factors, investigating the determinants of ED utilisation would be valuable. In this paper, we present a protocol for a systematic review of the determinants of ED utilisation among communitydwelling older adults aged 65 years and above, applying Andersen and Newman’s model of healthcare utilisation. Furthermore, we aim to present other conceptual frameworks for healthcare utilisation and propose a holistic approach for understanding the determinants of ED utilisation by older persons. Methods The protocol is developed in accordance with the standards of Campbell Collaboration guidelines for systematic reviews, with reference to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions. Medline, Embase and Scopus will be searched for studies published from 2000 to 2020. Studies evaluating more than one determinant for ED utilisation among older adults aged 65 years and above will be included. Search process and selection of studies will be presented in a PRISMA flow chart. Statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) determinants of ED utilisation will be grouped according to individual and societal determinants. Quality of the studies will be assessed using Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). Discussion In Andersen and Newman’s model, individual determinants include predisposing factors, enabling and illness factors, and societal determinants include technology and social norms. Additional conceptual frameworks for healthcare utilisation include Health Belief Model, Social Determinants of Health and Big Five personality traits. By incorporating the concepts of these models, we hope to develop a holistic approach of conceptualizing the factors that influence ED utilisation among older people.

There was no significant difference in the individual number and species number of herbivorous, predatory and parasitic groups in the two kinds of maize in two years. Only the individual number of HGK60 was significantly higher than that of common maize Zheng 58 at heading stage in 2019. And the percentages of individual number and species number in different groups were basically the same in the two kinds of maize at each stage in two years. Analyses of Richness index, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Dominance index and Evenness index showed no significant difference between the two kinds of maize in two years. The similarity coefficient of the arthropod community suggested that the arthropod community composition of HGK60 was similar to that of common maize Zheng 58. Furthermore, HGK60 had no significant effect on the relative stability of the arthropod community. These results indicated that despite the presence of a relatively minor difference in arthropod community between the two kinds of maize, the planting of HGK60 had little effect on arthropod community biodiversity. The results provided some data and support for the further studies of environmental risk of transgenic crops."
https://openalex.org/W4281776173,"To investigate impression formation, researchers tend to rely on statements that describe a person's behavior (e.g., ""Alex ridicules people behind their backs""). These statements are presented to participants who then rate their impressions of the person. However, a corpus of behavior statements is costly to generate, and pre-existing corpora may be outdated and might not measure the dimension(s) of interest. The present study makes available a normed corpus of 160 contemporary behavior statements that were rated on 4 dimensions relevant to impression formation: morality, competence, informativeness, and believability. In addition, we show that the different dimensions are non-independent, exhibiting a range of linear and non-linear relationships, which may present a problem for past research. However, researchers interested in impression formation can control for these relationships (e.g., statistically) using the present corpus of behavior statements."
https://openalex.org/W4281780074,"Service availability and readiness are critical for the delivery of quality and essential health care services. In Ghana, there is paucity of literature that describes general service readiness (GSR) of primary health care (PHC) facilities within the national context. This study therefore assessed the GSR of PHC facilities in Ghana to provide evidence to inform heath policy and drive action towards reducing health inequities.We analysed data from 140 Service Delivery Points (SDPs) that were part of the Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 survey (PMA2020). GSR was computed using the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) manual based on four out of five components. Descriptive statistics were computed for both continuous and categorical variables. A multivariable binary logistic regression model was fitted to assess predictors of scoring above the mean GSR. Analyses were performed using Stata version 16.0. Significance level was set at p<0.05.The average GSR index of SDPs in this study was 83.4%. Specifically, the mean GSR of hospitals was 92.8%, whereas health centres/clinics and CHPS compounds scored 78.0% and 64.3% respectively. The least average scores were observed in the essential medicines and standard precautions for infection prevention categories. We found significant sub-national, urban-rural and facility-related disparities in GSR. Compared to the Greater Accra Region, SDPs in the Eastern, Western, Upper East and Upper West Regions had significantly reduced odds of scoring above the overall GSR. Majority of SDPs with GSR below the average were from rural areas.Overall, GSR among SDPs is appreciable as compared to other settings. The study highlights the existence of regional, urban-rural and facility-related differences in GSR of SDPs. The reality of health inequities has crucial policy implications which need to be addressed urgently to fast-track progress towards the achievement of the SDGs and UHC targets by 2030."
https://openalex.org/W4281806267,"The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) is an influential monsoon system that provides two-thirds of the annual precipitation in the Asian region. Therefore, considerable attention has been paid to the changes in future climate. Thus far, studies on EASM characteristics have not been conducted considering specific global warming level (GWL) using Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 6 (CMIP6) simulations. We analyze the EASM characteristics in present-day (PD) and the changes in EASM corresponding to the projections at 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0°C GWLs. The newly released 30 CMIP6 models effectively captured the migration of the monsoon in PD with a pattern correlation coefficient of 0.91, which is an improvement over that reported in previous studies. As a result of the separate analysis of the P1 (first primary peak; 33-41 pentad) and P2 (from P1 to the withdrawal; 42-50 pentad) periods, a higher frequency of weak to moderate precipitation in P2 and a smaller amount of moderate to extreme precipitation in P1 are mainly occurred. The CMIP6 models project increasing precipitation of approximately 5.7%°C-1, 4.0%°C-1, and 3.9%°C-1 for the three GWLs, respectively, with longer durations (earlier onset and delayed termination). Under the three GWLs, the projected precipitation frequency decreases below 6 mm d-1 (76th percentile) and significant increases above 29 mm d-1 (97th percentile). These changes in precipitation frequency are associated with an increasing distribution of precipitation amount above 97th percentile. Additionally, these tendencies in P1 and P2 are similar to that of the total period, while the maximum changes occur in 3.0°C GWL. In particular, future changes in EASM accelerate with continuous warming and are mainly affected by enhanced extreme precipitation (above 97th percentile). Our findings are expected to provide information for the implementation of sustainable water management programs as a part of national climate policy."
https://openalex.org/W4281812619,"Background Self-reported leisure-time physical activity (PA) has previously been linked to risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We now aim to investigate the strength of associations between PA and different CVDs and how the risk varies with age. Methods PA and traditional CV risk factors assessed by a questionnaire on a four-level scale in 2,175 men at age 50 years in the ULSAM study. Examinations were thereafter repeated at ages 60, 70, and 77. Results During 40 years follow-up, 883 individuals experienced a CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure). Using data from all four examinations, a graded reduction in risk of incident CVD was seen with increasing PA (HR 0.84, 95%CI; 0.77–0.93, p = 0.001 for trend test). PA was related to myocardial infarction (HR 0.84, 95%CI; 0.74–0.95, 490 cases), heart failure (HR 0.79, 95%CI; 0.68–0.91, 356 cases), but only of borderline significance vs ischemic stroke (HR 0.85, 95%CI; 0.73–1.00, 315 cases) when the CVDs were analyzed separately. Adjusting for traditional CV risk factors attenuated all relationships between PA and incident CVD, and PA did not improve discrimination of CVD when added on top of risk factors. When 10-year risk was calculated from each examination, age 70 was the time-point when PA was most closely related to incident CVD. Conclusion Leisure-time physical activity is related to future CVD. This was most evident at 70 years of age. If a causal relationship between self-reported PA and CVD exists, this relationship might to a major degree be mediated by traditional risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W4281678672,"Overexpression of M3 subtype muscarinic receptors (M3R) hastens colon cancer progression. As microRNA (miRNA) expression is commonly dysregulated in cancer, we used microarrays to examine miRNA profiles in muscarinic receptor agonist-treated human colon cancer cells. We used quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) to validate microarray results and examine miRNA expression in colon cancers and adjacent normal colon. These assays revealed that acetylcholine (ACh) treatment robustly induced miR-222 expression; miR-222 levels were three-fold higher in cancer compared to normal colon. In kinetic studies, ACh induced a 4.6-fold increase in pri-miR-222 levels within 1 h, while mature miR-222 increased gradually to 1.8-fold within 4 h. To identify post-M3R signaling mediating these actions, we used chemical inhibitors and agonists. ACh-induced increases in pri-miR-222 were attenuated by pre-incubating cells with atropine and inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) and p38 MAPK. Treatment with a PKC agonist, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, increased pri-miR-222 levels, an effect blocked by PKC and p38 MAPK inhibitors, but not by atropine. Notably, treatment with ACh or transfection with miR-222 mimics increased cell proliferation; atropine blocked the effects of ACh but not miR-222. These findings identify a novel mechanism whereby post-M3R PKC/p38 MAPK signaling stimulates miR-222 expression and colon cancer cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W4281682664,"Neuronal dysfunction plays an important role in the high prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in people with HIV (PWH). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)-with its capability to improve neuronal function-may have the potential to serve as an alternative therapeutic approach for HAND. Brain imaging and neurobehavioral studies provide converging evidence that injury to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is highly prevalent and contributes to HAND in PWH, suggesting that ACC may serve as a potential neuromodulation target for HAND. Here we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, partial crossover pilot study to test the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of anodal tDCS over cingulate cortex in adults with HIV, with a focus on the dorsal ACC (dACC).Eleven PWH (47-69 years old, 2 females, 100% African Americans, disease duration 16-36 years) participated in the study, which had two phases, Phase 1 and Phase 2. During Phase 1, participants were randomized to receive ten sessions of sham (n = 4) or cingulate tDCS (n = 7) over the course of 2-3 weeks. Treatment assignments were unknown to the participants and the technicians. Neuropsychology and MRI data were collected from four additional study visits to assess treatment effects, including one baseline visit (BL, prior to treatment) and three follow-up visits (FU1, FU2, and FU3, approximately 1 week, 3 weeks, and 3 months after treatment, respectively). Treatment assignment was unblinded after FU3. Participants in the sham group repeated the study with open-label cingulate tDCS during Phase 2. Statistical analysis was limited to data from Phase 1.Compared to sham tDCS, cingulate tDCS led to a decrease in Perseverative Errors in Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), but not Non-Perseverative Errors, as well as a decrease in the ratio score of Trail Making Test-Part B (TMT-B) to TMT-Part A (TMT-A). Seed-to-voxel analysis with resting state functional MRI data revealed an increase in functional connectivity between the bilateral dACC and a cluster in the right dorsal striatum after cingulate tDCS. There were no differences in self-reported discomfort ratings between sham and cingulate tDCS.Cingulate tDCS is safe and well-tolerated in PWH, and may have the potential to improve cognitive performance and brain function. A future study with a larger sample is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4281685342,"Severe COVID-19 constitutes a form of viral sepsis. Part of the specific pathophysiological pattern of this condition is the occurrence of cardiovascular events. These include pulmonary embolism, arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy as manifestations of extra-pulmonary organ dysfunction. Hitherto, the prognostic impact of these cardiovascular events and their predisposing risk factors remains unclear. This study aims to explore this question in two cohorts of viral sepsis-COVID-19 and influenza-in order to identify new theragnostic strategies to improve the short- and long-term outcome of these two diseases.In this prospective multi-centre cohort study, clinical assessment will take place during the acute and post-acute phase of sepsis and be complemented by molecular laboratory analyses. Specifically, echocardiography and cardiovascular risk factor documentation will be performed during the first two weeks after sepsis onset. Aside from routine haematological and biochemical laboratory tests, molecular phenotyping will comprise analyses of the metabolome, lipidome and immune status. The primary endpoint of this study is the difference in 3-month mortality of patients with and without septic cardiomyopathy in COVID-19 sepsis. Patients will be followed up until 6 months after onset of sepsis via telephone interviews and questionnaires. The results will be compared with a cohort of patients with influenza sepsis as well as previous cohorts of patients with bacterial sepsis and healthy controls.Approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Friedrich Schiller University Jena (2020-2052-BO). The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at appropriate conferences.DRKS00024162."

Microdata obtained from the labor force survey for the years (2013-14, 2014-15, 2017-18) is used for the analysis. The realized match approach is used to measure the required level of education, and the augmented mincerian model is used to determine the potential earning effects associated with the educational mismatch. The study found a considerable incidence of under-education and over-education in the labor market. Results show a positive return to under-education and over-education. However, the return to the required level of education is significantly higher than both the under-education and over-education."
https://openalex.org/W4281738981,"Chronic back pain is prevalent in Brazil, leading to enormous healthcare costs and social burdens. It also disproportionately affects low-income and less-healthy people.This study examines the associations of chronic back pain with biological, psychological, and social factors; how it limits usual activities; and how chronic back pain influences the use of treatment services.Using Brazil's National Health Survey (PNS-2019), multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to examine how biological, psychological, and social factors correlate with chronic back pain, limitations on usual activities, and pain treatment.PNS-2019 data showed that 23.4% (95% CI 22.8-24.0) of Brazilian adults aged over 20 reported back pain. A higher prevalence of chronic back pain was associated with biological factors (older age, being female, overweight or obese, current smoking, and having more chronic conditions), lower social conditions (low education, low per capita household income, non-married, and living in rural areas), and poor psychological health (more depressive symptoms). Chronic back pain is more likely to limit usual activities among those with low social conditions (lower education, lower income), poor physical and behavioral health (obese, current smokers, and those with a greater number of chronic conditions), and worse psychological health (more depressive symptoms). However, married people and those who do not consume alcohol were also more likely to report limited activities. Among those with back pain, 68% received at least one form of treatment. Those with intense limitations on their usual activities were 2.2 times as likely to report treatment. People with higher social conditions (higher income, college education, and private health insurance) were more likely to receive treatment.The results show significant biological, psychological, and social disparities in the prevalence of chronic back pain in Brazil. The findings point to the need for tailored policies and prevention programs with attention to vulnerable groups. Even though Brazil has universal health care, those with better socioeconomic conditions are more likely to receive treatment."

https://openalex.org/W4281892190,"Background Carriage of certain bacterial species may represent potential biomarkers of colorectal cancer (CRC). Prominent among these is Fusobacterium nucleatum . We explored the association of F . nucleatum DNA in stool samples with the presence of colonic neoplastic lesions in a cohort of primary care patients, and compared our findings with those from an unrelated cohort of colonoscopy patients followed clinically over time. Methods Carriage rates of F . nucleatum in stool samples were assessed in 185 patients referred for a faecal immunochemical test (FIT) by their general practitioners (GPs). Comparisons were made with stool samples from 57 patients diagnosed with CRC and 57 age-matched healthy controls, and with tissue samples taken at colonoscopy from 150 patients with a decade of subsequent clinical follow-up. Findings F . nucleatum DNA was found at a high rate (47.0%) in stool samples from primary care patients, and more often in stool samples from CRC patients (47.4%) than in healthy controls (7.0%), (P = 7.66E-7). No association was found between carriage of F . nucleatum and FIT positivity (P = 0.588). While evidence of stool-associated F . nucleatum DNA was significantly more likely to indicate a lesion in those primary care patients progressed to colonoscopy (P = 0.023), this finding did not extend to the progression of neoplastic lesions in the 150 patients with a decade of follow up. Conclusion The finding of F . nucleatum DNA at similar rates in stool samples from patients diagnosed with CRC and in primary care patients with pre-cancerous lesions supports growing awareness that the presence of these bacteria may be a biomarker for increased risk of disease. However, molecular evidence of F . nucleatum did not predict progression of colonic lesions, which may lessen the utility of this bacterium as a biomarker for increased risk of disease."
https://openalex.org/W4281991410,"To address the problem of high failure rate and low accuracy in computed tomography (CT) image edge segmentation, we proposed a CT sequence image edge segmentation optimization algorithm using improved convolution neural network. Firstly, the pattern clustering algorithm is applied to cluster the pixels with relationship in the CT sequence image space to extract the edge information of the real CT image; secondly, Euclidean distance is used to calculate similarity and measure similarity, according to the measurement results, convolution neural network (CNN) hierarchical optimization is carried out to improve the convergence ability of CNN; finally, the pixel classification of CT sequence images is carried out, and the edge segmentation of CT sequence images is optimized according to the classification results. The results show that the overall recognition rate of this method is at a high level. The training time is obviously reduced when the training times exceed 12 times, the recall rate is always about 90%, and the accuracy of image segmentation is high, which solves the problem of large failure rate and low accuracy."
