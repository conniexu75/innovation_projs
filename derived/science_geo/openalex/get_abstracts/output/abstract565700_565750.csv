https://openalex.org/W2487407743,"Chronic diseases and multimorbidity are common and expected to rise over the coming years. The objective of this study is to examine the time trend in the prevalence of chronic diseases and multimorbidity over the period 2001 till 2011 in the Netherlands, and the extent to which this can be ascribed to the aging of the population.Monitoring study, using two data sources: 1) medical records of patients listed in a nationally representative network of general practices over the period 2002-2011, and 2) national health interview surveys over the period 2001-2011. Regression models were used to study trends in the prevalence-rates over time, with and without standardization for age.An increase from 34.9% to 41.8% (p<0.01) in the prevalence of chronic diseases was observed in the general practice registration over the period 2004-2011 and from 41.0% to 46.6% (p<0.01) based on self-reported diseases over the period 2001-2011. Multimorbidity increased from 12.7% to 16.2% (p<0.01) and from 14.3% to 17.5% (p<0.01), respectively. Aging of the population explained part of these trends: about one-fifth based on general practice data, and one-third for chronic diseases and half of the trend for multimorbidity based on health surveys.The prevalence of chronic diseases and multimorbidity increased over the period 2001-2011. Aging of the population only explained part of the increase, implying that other factors such as health care and society-related developments are responsible for a substantial part of this rise."
https://openalex.org/W2482092413,"Genome-wide association studies of gene expression traits and other cellular phenotypes have successfully identified links between genetic variation and biological processes. The majority of discoveries have uncovered cis-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) effects via mass univariate testing of SNPs against gene expression in single tissues. Here we present a Bayesian method for multiple-tissue experiments focusing on uncovering gene networks linked to genetic variation. Our method decomposes the 3D array (or tensor) of gene expression measurements into a set of latent components. We identify sparse gene networks that can then be tested for association against genetic variation across the genome. We apply our method to a data set of 845 individuals from the TwinsUK cohort with gene expression measured via RNA-seq analysis in adipose, lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and skin. We uncover several gene networks with a genetic basis and clear biological and statistical significance. Extensions of this approach will allow integration of different omics, environmental and phenotypic data sets."
https://openalex.org/W2494982315,"In each individual, a highly diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire interacts with peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Despite extensive research, it remains controversial whether germline-encoded TCR-MHC contacts promote TCR-MHC specificity and, if so, whether differences exist in TCR V gene compatibilities with different MHC alleles. We applied expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping to test for associations between genetic variation and TCR V gene usage in a large human cohort. We report strong trans associations between variation in the MHC locus and TCR V gene usage. Fine-mapping of the association signals identifies specific amino acids from MHC genes that bias V gene usage, many of which contact or are spatially proximal to the TCR or peptide in the TCR-peptide-MHC complex. Hence, these MHC variants, several of which are linked to autoimmune diseases, can directly affect TCR-MHC interaction. These results provide the first examples of trans-QTL effects mediated by protein-protein interactions and are consistent with intrinsic TCR-MHC specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2487238524,"RHO GTPase-activating proteins (RHOGAPs) are one of the major classes of regulators of the RHO-related protein family that are crucial in many cellular processes, motility, contractility, growth, differentiation, and development. Using database searches, we extracted 66 distinct human RHOGAPs, from which 57 have a common catalytic domain capable of terminating RHO protein signaling by stimulating the slow intrinsic GTP hydrolysis (GTPase) reaction. The specificity of the majority of the members of RHOGAP family is largely uncharacterized. Here, we comprehensively investigated the sequence-structure-function relationship between RHOGAPs and RHO proteins by combining our in vitro data with in silico data. The activity of 14 representatives of the RHOGAP family toward 12 RHO family proteins was determined in real time. We identified and structurally verified hot spots in the interface between RHOGAPs and RHO proteins as critical determinants for binding and catalysis. We have found that the RHOGAP domain itself is nonselective and in some cases rather inefficient under cell-free conditions. Thus, we propose that other domains of RHOGAPs confer substrate specificity and fine-tune their catalytic efficiency in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2484327514,"Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are known to associate with estrogen receptors (ER) and regulate ER-mediated cell proliferation. Historically, the studies in this area have focused on Hsp90. However, some critical aspects of the Hsp-ERα interactions remain unclear. For example, we do not know which Hsps are the major or minor ERα interactants and whether or not different Hsp isoforms associate equally with ERα. In the present study, through a quantitative proteomic method we found that 21 Hsps and 3 Hsp cochaperones were associated with ERα in human 293T cells that were cultured in a medium containing necessary elements for cell proliferation. Four Hsp70s (Hsp70-1, Hsc70, Grp75, and Grp78) were the most abundant Hsps identified to associate with ERα, followed by two Hsp90s (Hsp90α and Hsp90β) and three Hsp110s (Hsp105, HspA4, and HspA4L). Hsp90α was found to be 2-3 times more abundant than Hsp90β in the ERα-containing complexes. Among the reported Hsp cochaperones, we detected prostaglandin E synthase 3 (p23), peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP5 (FKBP51), and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase CHIP (CHIP). Studies with the two most abundant ERα-associated Hsps, Hsp70-1 and Hsc70, using human breast cancer MCF7 cells demonstrate that the two Hsps interacted with ERα in both the cytoplasm and nucleus when the cells were cultured in a medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and phenol red. Interestingly, the ERα-Hsp70-1/Hsc70 interactions were detected only in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus under hormone starvation conditions, and stimulation of the starved cells with 17β-estradiol (E2) did not change this. In addition, E2-treatment weakened the ERα-Hsc70 interaction but had no effect on the ERα-Hsp70-1 interaction. Further studies showed that significant portions of Hsp70-1 and Hsc70 were associated with transcriptionally active chromatin and inactive chromatin, and the two Hsps interacted with ERα in both forms of the chromatins in MCF7 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2488630313,"The strategies that experts have used to share information about social causes have historically been top-down, meaning the most influential messages are believed to come from planned events and campaigns. However, more people are independently engaging with social causes today than ever before, in part because online platforms allow them to instantaneously seek, create, and share information. In some cases this “organic advocacy” may rival or even eclipse top-down strategies. Big data analytics make it possible to rapidly detect public engagement with social causes by analyzing the same platforms from which organic advocacy spreads. To demonstrate this claim we evaluated how Leonardo DiCaprio’s 2016 Oscar acceptance speech citing climate change motivated global English language news (Bloomberg Terminal news archives), social media (Twitter postings) and information seeking (Google searches) about climate change. Despite an insignificant increase in traditional news coverage (54%; 95%CI: -144 to 247), tweets including the terms “climate change” or “global warming” reached record highs, increasing 636% (95%CI: 573–699) with more than 250,000 tweets the day DiCaprio spoke. In practical terms the “DiCaprio effect” surpassed the daily average effect of the 2015 Conference of the Parties (COP) and the Earth Day effect by a factor of 3.2 and 5.3, respectively. At the same time, Google searches for “climate change” or “global warming” increased 261% (95%CI, 186–335) and 210% (95%CI 149–272) the day DiCaprio spoke and remained higher for 4 more days, representing 104,190 and 216,490 searches. This increase was 3.8 and 4.3 times larger than the increases observed during COP’s daily average or on Earth Day. Searches were closely linked to content from Dicaprio’s speech (e.g., “hottest year”), as unmentioned content did not have search increases (e.g., “electric car”). Because these data are freely available in real time our analytical strategy provides substantial lead time for experts to detect and participate in organic advocacy while an issue is salient. Our study demonstrates new opportunities to detect and aid agents of change and advances our understanding of communication in the 21st century media landscape."
https://openalex.org/W2477388835,"Pooled feces collected over two years from 1749 transport trailers hauling western-Canadian slaughter cattle were analysed by PCR for detection of Escherichia coli serogroups O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, O145, and O157. Sequential immunomagnetic separation was then used to collect bacterial isolates (n = 1035) from feces positive for target serogroups. Isolated bacteria were tested by PCR to confirm serogroup and the presence of eae, ehxA, stx1, and stx2 virulence genes. Based on PCR screening, serogroup prevalence in feces ranged from 7.0% (O145) to 94.4% (O103) with at least 3 serogroups present in 79.5% of samples. Origin of cattle affected serogroup PCR prevalence and O157 was most prevalent in feces from south-west Alberta (P < 0.001). All serogroups demonstrated seasonal variations in PCR prevalence, with O26, O45, O103, O121, and O157 least prevalent (P < 0.001) in cooler winter months, while uncommon serogroups O111 and O145 increased in prevalence during winter (P < 0.001). However, isolates collected during winter were predominantly from serogroups O103 and O45. No seasonal variation was noted in proportion of isolates which were Shiga toxin containing E. coli (STEC; P = 0.18) or positive for Shiga toxin and eae (enterohemorrhagic E. coli; EHEC; P = 0.29). Isolates of serogroups O111, O145, and O157 were more frequently EHEC than were others, although 37.6-54.3% of isolates from other serogroups were also EHEC. Shiga-toxin genes present also varied by geographic origin of cattle (P < 0.05) in all serogroups except O157. As cattle within feedlots are sourced from multiple regions, locational differences in serogroup prevalence and virulence genes imply existence of selection pressures for E. coli and their virulence in western-Canadian cattle. Factors which reduce carriage or expression of virulence genes, particularly in non-O157 serogroups, should be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2482748595,"TGF-β plays a central role in the pathogenesis of fibroproliferative disorders. Defining the exact underlying molecular basis is therefore critical for the development of viable therapeutic strategies. Here, we show that expression of the facilitative glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is induced by TGF-β in fibroblast lines and primary cells and is required for the profibrotic effects of TGF-β. In addition, enhanced GLUT1 expression is observed in fibrotic areas of lungs of both patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and mice that are subjected to a fibrosis-inducing bleomycin treatment. By using pharmacologic and genetic approaches, we demonstrate that up-regulation of GLUT1 occurs via the canonical Smad2/3 pathway and requires autocrine activation of the receptor tyrosine kinases, platelet-derived and epidermal growth factor receptors. Engagement of the common downstream effector PI3K subsequently triggers activation of the MEK and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2, which cooperate in regulating GLUT1 expression. Of note, inhibition of GLUT1 activity and/or expression is shown to impair TGFβ–driven fibrogenic processes, including cell proliferation and production of profibrotic mediators. These findings provide new perspectives on the interrelation of metabolism and profibrotic TGF-β signaling and present opportunities for potential therapeutic intervention.—Andrianifahanana, M., Hernandez, D.

https://openalex.org/W2484268956,"Primary cilia are highly specialized small antenna-like cellular protrusions that extend from the cell surface of many eukaryotic cell types. The protein content inside cilia and cytoplasm is very different, but details of the sorting process are not understood for most ciliary proteins. Recently, we have shown that prenylated proteins are sorted according to their affinity to the carrier protein PDE6δ and the ability of Arl3 but not Arl2 to release high affinity cargo inside the cilia (Fansa, E. K., Kösling, S. K., Zent, E., Wittinghofer, A., and Ismail, S. (2016) Nat. Commun. 7, 11366). Here we address the question whether a similar principle governs the transport of myristoylated cargo by the carrier proteins Unc119a and Unc119b. We thus analyzed the binding strength of N-terminal myristoylated cargo peptides (GNAT1, NPHP3, Cystin1, RP2, and Src) to Unc119a and Unc119b proteins. The affinity between myristoylated cargo and carrier protein, Unc119, varies between subnanomolar and micromolar. Peptides derived from ciliary localizing proteins (GNAT1, NPHP3, and Cystin1) bind with high affinity to Unc119 proteins, whereas a peptide derived from a non-ciliary localizing protein (Src) has low affinity. The peptide with intermediate affinity (RP2) is localized at the ciliary transition zone as a gate keeper. We show that the low affinity peptides are released by both Arl2·GppNHp and Arl3·GppNHp, whereas the high affinity peptides are exclusively released by only Arl3·GppNHp. Determination of the x-ray structure of myristoylated NPHP3 peptide in complex with Unc119a reveals the molecular details of high affinity binding and suggests the importance of the residues at the +2 and +3 positions relative to the myristoylated glycine for high and low affinities. The mutational analysis of swapping the residues at the +2 and +3 positions between high and low affinity peptides results in reversing their affinities for Unc119a and leads to a partial mislocalization of a low affinity mutant of NPHP3.

The existence of cilia in higher organisms was discovered a century ago, but research to explore the functional importance of cilia has only recently intensified. Cilia are highly specialized small antenna-like cellular protrusions that extend from the cell surface of almost all eukaryotic cell types. Primary cilia as sensory organelles are important for many cellular functions. They work as control centers of developmental signaling pathways, such as Hedgehog, or the induction of left-right asymmetry (2Veland I.R. Awan A. Pedersen L.B. Yoder B.K. Christensen S.T.

Biol. 2009; 19: R526-R535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Ciliary dysfunction leads to a range of diseases like Meckel-Gruber syndrome, Joubert syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, nephronophthisis, and polycystic kidney disease, which are commonly identified as ciliopathies (5Waters A.M. Beales P.L. Ciliopathies: an expanding disease spectrum.Pediatr. Nephrol. 2011; 26: 1039-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Although the ciliary membrane is the extension of plasma membrane, the lipid composition is different from that of the plasma membrane (6Tyler K.M. Fridberg A. Toriello K.M. Olson C.L. Cieslak J.A. Hazlett T.L. Engman D.M. Flagellar membrane localization via association with lipid rafts.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The composition and concentrations of proteins inside this compartment are also very different from the entire cell (7Nachury M.V. How do cilia organize signalling cascades?.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2014; (10.1098/rstb.2013.0465)Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A membrane barrier between cilia and the rest of the cell formed by a septin ring has been postulated such that the entry of transmembrane and membrane-associated proteins is tightly regulated (8Hu Q. Milenkovic L. Jin H. Scott M.P. Nachury M.V. Spiliotis E.T. Nelson W.J.

This renders the ciliary membrane a very specialized compartment of the cell, which orchestrates proteins to achieve spatially controlled signaling pathways. However, the regulation of entry into and retention inside cilia and signals for such processes are still incompletely understood. It has been proposed that partition of proteins between cilium and cell body is directed by steric hindrance and/or cytoskeletal structures (11Najafi M. Maza N.A. Calvert P.D. Steric volume exclusion sets soluble protein concentrations in photoreceptor sensory cilia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We and others have previously shown that proteins with a C-terminal CaaX box motif, which are post-translationally modified with a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moiety, are transported via the δ subunit of phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6δ) (1Fansa E.K.

The prenyl-binding protein PrBP/δ: a chaperone participating in intracellular trafficking.Vision Res. 2012; 75: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PDE6δ is a structural homologue to RhoGDI. It forms a β-sandwich fold with a deep hydrophobic pocket, which binds the prenylated cysteine and the adjacent three amino acid residues, two of which determine the affinity of the interaction. We have shown recently that the sorting of cargo between cilia and the rest of the cell depends on the affinity between cargo and PDE6δ, such that cargo with high affinity is destined for cilia, whereas low affinity cargo stays in the rest of the cell or is no longer exclusively retained inside the cilium (1Fansa E.K.

Unc119a (uncoordinated), also known as HRG4 (human retina gene 4) and Unc119b share 58% sequence identity and are homologous to PDE6δ. The C termini of Unc119a/b share the PDEδ-like β-sandwich domain, whereas they are considerably divergent in the N-terminal part. Unc119a has been shown to be localized at the basal body of the cilium, whereas the homologous Unc119b localizes to the transition zone and proximal cilium of RPE cells (16Wright K.J. Baye L.M.

Recently, we have shown that high affinity binding between farnesylated cargo INPP5E and PDE6δ leads to INPP5E recruitment to the ciliary membrane, and its release from PDE6δ by Arl3 exclusively in cilia, whereas low affinity binding between farnesylated Rheb and PDE6δ results in Rheb localization to the cytosol (1Fansa E.K. Kösling S.K. Zent E. Wittinghofer A. Ismail S. PDE6delta-mediated sorting of INPP5E into the cilium is determined by cargo-carrier affinity.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11366Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we have set out to perform a comparative more comprehensive analysis of the interaction between Unc119a/b and different myristoylated proteins, the interaction with Arl2 and Arl3, and finally the release of cargo by Arl2 and Arl3. The myristoylated proteins analyzed in this study are NPHP3, Cystin1, GNAT1, RP2, and Src. We find different affinities of Unc119a/b for Arl2 and Arl3 and for cargo peptides and differences in cargo release by Arl2/3. By structure-guided mutational analysis, we show how the difference in affinities can be manipulated between high and low affinity cargo. Our results suggest that similar to the transport of prenylated cargo into cilia, the import of myristoylated cargo might be determined by the cargo-carrier binding affinity and the cargo release specificity mediated by Arl2 and Arl3. Using fluorescence polarization, we measured the binding affinity of both Unc119a and Unc119b to N-terminal myristoylated peptides derived from transducin-α (GNAT1), NPHP3, Cystin1, RP2, and Src, which were labeled with fluorescein at the C terminus. Preliminary experiments had suggested that some of the affinities were too high to be reliably measured by equilibrium methods (data not shown; also see below). Thus, we used kinetic measurements via stopped flow instead to determine association and dissociation rate constants and obtain KD (Fig. 1). Fig. 1A shows the association of 1 μm fluorescein-labeled N-terminal myristoylated GNAT1 peptide with increasing concentrations of Unc119a. The association of the myristoylated GNAT1 peptide with Unc119a (0.2–20 μm) leads to the increase in fluorescence polarization. Plotting of the observed rate constants (kobs) against the concentration of Unc119a resulted in the determination of the association rate constant (kon) of the reaction (Fig. 1B). The association rate constant (kon) for Unc119a is 4.6 μm−1 s−1 and is very similar to Unc119b (6.3 μm−1 s−1) measured under the same conditions (Fig. 1B). Association rate measurements were also measured for the N-terminal myristoylated peptides from NPHP3, Cystin1, RP2, and Src under similar experimental conditions, and the association rate constants (kon) obtained are shown as a bar diagram in Fig. 1C and numerically in Table 1. These values are very similar and range from 3.4 to 12 μm−1 s−1. Association of myristoylated cargo is generally slightly faster for Unc119b than for Unc119a.TABLE 1N terminus-myristoylated peptide binding properties for Unc119 proteinsProteinGNAT1NPHP3Cystin1RP2SrcAssociation constants (kon) of Unc119a/b for N terminus-myristoylated peptides (s−1 μm−1)Unc119a4.644.266.313.444.23Unc119b6.326.046.776.4411.99Dissociation rates (koff) by 100× non-labeled peptide (s−1)Unc119a0.00230.00020.00060.1451.07Unc119b0.03640.00010.00040.3041.74Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of Unc119a/b for N-terminal myristoylated peptides (nm)Unc119a0.490.0430.09542.1252.96Unc119b5.760.020.05947.2145.12Dissociation rates (koff) by 10× Arl3 in the presence of 100× non-labeled peptide (s−1)Unc119a2.81.725.20.612.73Unc119b5.62.511.30.522.82Dissociation rates (koff) by 10× Arl2 in the presence of 100× non-labeled peptide (s−1)Unc119a0.0450.0180.0020.562.83Unc119b0.6580.0320.0010.383.99 Open table in a new tab The dissociation rate constants were determined by incubating a complex of C-terminal fluorescein labeled N-terminal myristoylated peptides with Unc119a/b in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled peptides, as shown for the GNAT1 peptide (Fig. 1D). In contrast to kon, the koff values vary considerably among the different peptides over a 900-fold range from 0.0002 to 1.74 s−1 (Fig. 1E and Table 1). NPHP3 and Cystin1 show the slowest release from Unc119a with 0.002 and 0.006 s−1, whereas Src peptide has the fastest off rate close to 1 s−1. The rate for RP2 is intermediate between very slow and very fast rates. The dissociation rate constants of Unc119a and -b for NPHP3, Cystin1, RP2, and Src are rather similar, but for GNAT1, there is a >10-fold difference between Unc119a and Unc119b, with koff values of 0.0023 and 0.035 s−1, respectively. The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) for the complexes between Unc119a/b and myristoylated peptides were calculated as the ratio of koff/kon (Fig. 1F and Table 1). The data revealed three different categories of affinity: (i) the very tight binding with subnanomolar affinities for Cystin1 and NPHP3 and low nanomolar affinity for GNAT1, (ii) the intermediate binding affinity in the two-digit nanomolar range for RP2, and (iii) the low affinity in the submicromolar range for Src (145–252 nm) (Fig. 1F and Table 1). The affinities of Unc119a and Unc119b for myristoylated peptides are similar except for GNAT1, which shows >10-fold higher affinity for Unc119a as compared with Unc119b, exclusively due to the different dissociation rates. The affinities determined here by kinetics are different from those determined earlier by an equilibrium method (31Ismail S.A. Chen Y.X. Miertzschke M. Vetter I.R. Koerner C. Wittinghofer A.

As indicated above, equilibrium binding assays are not quite suitable for such high affinities (picomolar or sub-nanomolar) because such affinity measurements by titration result in straight lines that look like active site titrations and only give upper limits for the KD.

T. harzianum, T. asperellum, T. hamatum, and T. virens were identified as the dominant species with dominance (Y) values of 0.057, 0.052, 0.048, and 0.039, respectively. The species amount, isolate numbers and the dominant species of Trichoderma varied between provinces. Zhejiang Province has shown the highest diversity, which was reflected in the highest species amount (14) and the highest Shannon–Wiener diversity index of Trichoderma haplotypes (1.46). We observed that relative frequencies of T. hamatum and T. koningiopsis under rice soil were higher than those under wheat and maize soil, indicating the preference of Trichoderma to different crops. Remarkable seasonal variation was shown, with summer exhibiting the highest biodiversity of the studied seasons. These results show that Trichoderma biodiversity in agricultural fields varies by region, crop, and season. Zhejiang Province (the southernmost province in the investigated area) had more T. hamatum than Shandong Province (the northernmost province), not only in isolate amounts but also in haplotype amounts. Furthermore, at haplotype level, only T. hamatum showed a gradient distribution from south to north in correspondence analysis among the four dominant species. The above results would contribute to the application of Trichoderma biocontrol strains."
https://openalex.org/W2494464391,"We report here that a population of human β2-adrenergic receptors (β2AR), a canonical G protein-coupled receptor, traffics along a previously undescribed intracellular itinerary via the Golgi complex that is associated with the sequential S-palmitoylation and depalmitoylation of a previously undescribed site of modification, Cys-265 within the third intracellular loop. Basal S-palmitoylation of Cys-265 is negligible, but agonist-induced β2AR activation results in enhanced S-palmitoylation, which requires phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase of Ser-261/Ser-262. Agonist-induced turnover of palmitate occurs predominantly on Cys-265.

Inhibition of depalmitoylation reveals that S-palmitoylation of Cys-265 may stabilize the receptor at the plasma membrane. In addition, β2AR S-palmitoylated at Cys-265 are selectively preserved under a sustained adrenergic stimulation, which results in the down-regulation and degradation of βAR. Cys-265 is not conserved in β1AR, and S-palmitoylation of Cys-265 may thus be associated with functional differences between β2AR and β1AR, including relative resistance of β2AR to down-regulation in multiple pathophysiologies.

https://openalex.org/W2477333650,"Folding-defective mutants of the human dopamine transporter (DAT) cause a syndrome of infantile dystonia/parkinsonism. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle that the folding deficit is amenable to correction in vivo by two means, the cognate DAT ligand noribogaine and the HSP70 inhibitor, pifithrin-μ. We examined the Drosophila melanogaster (d) mutant dDAT-G108Q, which leads to a sleepless phenotype in flies harboring this mutation. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested an unstable structure of dDAT-G108Q consistent with a folding defect. This conjecture was verified; heterologously expressed dDAT-G108Q and the human (h) equivalent hDAT-G140Q were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum in a complex with endogenous folding sensors (calnexin and HSP70-1A). Incubation of the cells with noribogaine (a DAT ligand selective for the inward-facing state) and/or pifithrin-μ (an HSP70 inhibitor) restored folding of, and hence dopamine transport by, dDAT-G108Q and hDAT-G140Q. The mutated versions of DAT were confined to the cell bodies of the dopaminergic neurons in the fly brain and failed to reach the axonal compartments. Axonal delivery was restored, and sleep time was increased to normal length (from 300 to 1000 min/day) if the dDAT-G108Q-expressing flies were treated with noribogaine and/or pifithrin-μ. Rescuing misfolded versions of DAT by pharmacochaperoning is of therapeutic interest; it may provide opportunities to remedy disorders arising from folding-defective mutants of human DAT and of other related SLC6 transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2488472929,"In order to realize the stability control of the planar inverted pendulum system, which is a typical multi-variable and strong coupling system, a new fuzzy-evidential controller based on fuzzy inference and evidential reasoning is proposed. Firstly, for each axis, a fuzzy nine-point controller for the rod and a fuzzy nine-point controller for the cart are designed. Then, in order to coordinate these two controllers of each axis, a fuzzy-evidential coordinator is proposed. In this new fuzzy-evidential controller, the empirical knowledge for stabilization of the planar inverted pendulum system is expressed by fuzzy rules, while the coordinator of different control variables in each axis is built incorporated with the dynamic basic probability assignment (BPA) in the frame of fuzzy inference. The fuzzy-evidential coordinator makes the output of the control variable smoother, and the control effect of the new controller is better compared with some other work. The experiment in MATLAB shows the effectiveness and merit of the proposed method."

This study aimed to create a new histological classification applicable to an in vivo mouse intervertebral disc degeneration model induced by needle puncture. One hundred six mice were operated and the L4/5 intervertebral disc was punctured with a 35- or 33-gauge needle. Micro-computed tomography scanning was performed, and the punctured region was confirmed. Evaluation was performed by using magnetic resonance imaging and histology by employing our classification scoring system. Our histological classification scores correlated well with the findings of magnetic resonance imaging and could detect degenerative progression, irrespective of the punctured region. However, the magnetic resonance imaging analysis revealed that there was no significant degenerative intervertebral disc change between the ventrally punctured and non-punctured control groups. To induce significant degeneration in the lumbar intervertebral discs, the central or dorsal region should be punctured instead of the ventral region."

We used logistic regression to determine factors associated with TB diagnosis among the contacts.Of 272,441 close contacts of 47, 021 index cases screened, 13,886 and 2, 091 had presumptive and active TB respectively. The yield of active TB was thus 768/100, 000, contributing 25.4% of the 7,954 TB cases reported from the study zones over the study period. The yield was highest among workplace contacts (12,650/100, 000). Active TB was twice more likely among contacts whose index cases had been registered for TB treatment within the last 12 months compared with those who had been registered 24 or more months earlier (adjusted odds ratio, AOR: 1.77 95% CI 1.42-2.21). Sex or clinical type of TB in index cases was not associated with the yield. Smear negative (SS-) index cases (AOR: 1.74 955 CI 1.13-2.68), having index cases who registered for treatment within <12 months (AOR: 2.41 95% CI 1.51-3.84) and being household contact (AOR: 0.072 95% CI 0.01-0.52) were associated with the occurrence of active TB in children.The yield of retrospective contact investigation was about six times the case notification in the study zones, contributing a fourth of all TB cases notified over the same period. The yield was highest among workplace contacts and in those with recent past history of contact. Retrospective contact screening can serve as additional strategy to identify high risk groups not addressed through currently recommended screening approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2502760997,"Background A major challenge to HIV eradication strategies is the lack of an accurate measurement of the total burden of replication-competent HIV (the “reservoir”). We assessed the association of anti-HIV antibody responses and the estimated size of the reservoir during antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods We evaluated anti-HIV antibody profiles using luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) assay in relation to several blood-based HIV reservoir measures: total and 2-LTR DNA (rtPCR or droplet digital PCR); integrated DNA (Alu PCR); unspliced RNA (rtPCR), multiply-spliced RNA (TILDA), residual plasma HIV RNA (single copy PCR), and replication-competent virus (outgrowth assay). We also assessed total HIV DNA and RNA in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (rtPCR). Spearman correlations and linear regressions were performed using log-transformed blood- or tissue-based reservoir measurements as predictors and log-transformed antibody levels as outcome variables. Results Among 51 chronically HIV-infected ART-suppressed participants (median age = 57, nadir CD4+ count = 196 cells/mm3, ART duration = 9 years), the most statistically significant associations were between antibody responses to integrase and HIV RNA in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (1.17 fold-increase per two-fold RNA increase, P = 0.004) and between antibody responses to matrix and integrated HIV DNA in resting CD4+ T cells (0.35 fold-decrease per two-fold DNA increase, P = 0.003). However, these associations were not statistically significant after a stringent Bonferroni-adjustment of P<0.00045. Multivariate models including age and duration of ART did not markedly alter results. Conclusions Our findings suggest that anti-HIV antibody responses may reflect the size of the HIV reservoir during chronic treated HIV disease, possibly via antigen recognition in reservoir sites. Larger, prospective studies are needed to validate the utility of antibody levels as a measure of the total body burden of HIV during treatment."

Although there has been some investigation into clonal invertebrates and yeast, nothing is known about kin selection in clonal vertebrates. We show that a clonal fish, the Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa), can distinguish between different clonal lineages, associating with genetically identical, sister clones, and use multiple sensory modalities. Also, they scale their aggressive behaviors according to the relatedness to other females: they are more aggressive to non-related clones. Our results demonstrate that even in species with very small genetic differences between individuals, kin recognition can be adaptive. Their discriminatory abilities and regulation of costly behaviors provides a powerful example of natural selection in species with limited genetic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2480299138,"Indicators are increasingly used to measure environmental systems; however, they are often criticized for failing to measure and describe uncertainty. Uncertainty is particularly difficult to evaluate and communicate in the case of composite indicators which aggregate many indicators of ecosystem condition. One of the ongoing goals of the Ocean Health Index (OHI) has been to improve our approach to dealing with missing data, which is a major source of uncertainty. Here we: (1) quantify the potential influence of gapfilled data on index scores from the 2015 global OHI assessment; (2) develop effective methods of tracking, quantifying, and communicating this information; and (3) provide general guidance for implementing gapfilling procedures for existing and emerging indicators, including regional OHI assessments. For the overall OHI global index score, the percent contribution of gapfilled data was relatively small (18.5%); however, it varied substantially among regions and goals. In general, smaller territorial jurisdictions and the food provision and tourism and recreation goals required the most gapfilling. We found the best approach for managing gapfilled data was to mirror the general framework used to organize, calculate, and communicate the Index data and scores. Quantifying gapfilling provides a measure of the reliability of the scores for different regions and components of an indicator. Importantly, this information highlights the importance of the underlying datasets used to calculate composite indicators and can inform and incentivize future data collection."
https://openalex.org/W2495137326,"Phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the most common naturally occurring and most thoroughly studied plant growth regulator. Microbial synthesis of IAA has long been known. Microbial IAA biosynthesis has been proposed as possibly occurring through multiple pathways, as has been proven in plants. However, the biosynthetic pathways of IAA and the ecological roles of IAA in yeast have not been widely studied. In this study, we investigated the variation in IAA production and its effect on the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its closest relative Saccharomyces paradoxus yeasts from diverse ecological sources. We found that almost all Saccharomyces yeasts produced IAA when cultured in medium supplemented with the primary precursor of IAA, L-tryptophan (L-Trp). However, when cultured in medium without L-Trp, IAA production was only detected in three strains. Furthermore, exogenous added IAA exerted stimulatory and inhibitory effects on yeast growth. Interestingly, a negative correlation was observed between the amount of IAA production in the yeast cultures and the IAA inhibition ratio of their growth."
https://openalex.org/W2479541847,"The most common properties of oncogenes are cell proliferation and the prevention of apoptosis in malignant cells, which, as a consequence, induce tumor formation and dissemination. However, the effects of oncogenes on the tumor microenvironment (TME) have not yet been examined in detail. The accumulation of ascites accompanied by chronic inflammation and elevated concentrations of VEGF is a hallmark of the progression of ovarian cancer. We herein demonstrated the mechanisms by which oncogenes contribute to modulating the ovarian cancer microenvironment. c-MYC and KRAS were transduced into the mouse ovarian cancer cell line ID8. ID8, ID8-c-MYC, or ID8-KRAS cells were then injected into the peritoneal cavities of C57/BL6 mice and the production of ascites was assessed. ID8-c-MYC and ID8-KRAS both markedly accelerated ovarian cancer progression in vivo, whereas no significant differences were observed in proliferative activity in vitro. ID8-KRAS in particular induced the production of ascites, which accumulated between approximately two to three weeks after the injection, more rapidly than ID8 and ID8-c-MYC (between nine and ten weeks and between six and seven weeks, respectively). VEGF concentrations in ascites significantly increased in c-MYC-induced ovarian cancer, whereas the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in ascites were significantly high in KRAS-induced ovarian cancer and were accompanied by an increased number of neutrophils in ascites. A cytokine array revealed that KRAS markedly induced the expression of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in ID8 cells. These results suggest that oncogenes promote cancer progression by modulating the TME in favor of cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2491296685,"Patients with Lynch syndrome (LS) have a significantly increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) and other cancers. Genetic screening for LS among patients with newly diagnosed CRC aims to identify mutations in the disease-causing genes (i.e., the DNA mismatch repair genes) in the patients, to offer genetic testing for relatives of the patients with the mutations, and then to provide early prevention for the relatives with the mutations. Several genetic tests are available for LS, such as DNA sequencing for MMR genes and tumor testing using microsatellite instability and immunohistochemical analyses. Cost-effectiveness analyses of different genetic testing strategies for LS have been performed in several studies from different countries such as the US and Germany. However, a cost-effectiveness analysis for the testing has not yet been performed in Taiwan. In this study, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of four genetic testing strategies for LS described in previous studies, while population-specific parameters, such as the mutation rates of the DNA mismatch repair genes and treatment costs for CRC in Taiwan, were used. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios based on discounted life years gained due to genetic screening were calculated for the strategies relative to no screening and to the previous strategy. Using the World Health Organization standard, which was defined based on Taiwan’s Gross Domestic Product per capita, the strategy based on immunohistochemistry as a genetic test followed by BRAF mutation testing was considered to be highly cost-effective relative to no screening. Our probabilistic sensitivity analysis results also suggest that the strategy has a probability of 0.939 of being cost-effective relative to no screening based on the commonly used threshold of $50,000 to determine cost-effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cost-effectiveness analysis for evaluating different genetic testing strategies for LS in Taiwan. The results will be informative for the government when considering offering screening for LS in patients newly diagnosed with CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2497928942,"The kinetics of protein transport to and from the vascular compartment play a major role in the determination of fluid balance and plasma refilling during hemodialysis (HD) sessions. In this study we propose a whole-body mathematical model describing water and protein shifts across the capillary membrane during HD and compare its output to clinical data while evaluating the impact of choosing specific values for selected parameters.The model follows a two-compartment structure (vascular and interstitial space) and is based on balance equations of protein mass and water volume in each compartment. The capillary membrane was described according to the three-pore theory. Two transport parameters, the fractional contribution of large pores (αLP) and the total hydraulic conductivity (LpS) of the capillary membrane, were estimated from patient data. Changes in the intensity and direction of individual fluid and solute flows through each part of the transport system were analyzed in relation to the choice of different values of small pores radius and fractional conductivity, lymphatic sensitivity to hydraulic pressure, and steady-state interstitial-to-plasma protein concentration ratio.The estimated values of LpS and αLP were respectively 10.0 ± 8.4 mL/min/mmHg (mean ± standard deviation) and 0.062 ± 0.041. The model was able to predict with good accuracy the profiles of plasma volume and serum total protein concentration in most of the patients (average root-mean-square deviation < 2% of the measured value).The applied model provides a mechanistic interpretation of fluid transport processes induced by ultrafiltration during HD, using a minimum of tuned parameters and assumptions. The simulated values of individual flows through each kind of pore and lymphatic absorption rate yielded by the model may suggest answers to unsolved questions on the relative impact of these not-measurable quantities on total vascular refilling and fluid balance."

PREX1 and PREX2 GEF activity is activated by the second messengers PIP3 and Gβγ, and further regulation of PREX GEF activity occurs by phosphorylation. Stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases by neuregulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) leads to the phosphorylation of PREX1; however, the kinases that phosphorylate PREX1 downstream of these ligands are not known. We recently reported that the p21-activated kinases (PAKs), which are activated by GTP-bound Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), mediate the phosphorylation of PREX2 after insulin receptor activation. Here we show that certain phosphorylation events on PREX1 after insulin, neuregulin, and IGF1 treatment are PAK-dependent and lead to a reduction in PREX1 binding to PIP3. Like PREX2, PAK-mediated phosphorylation also negatively regulates PREX1 GEF activity. Furthermore, the onset of PREX1 phosphorylation was delayed compared with the phosphorylation of AKT, supporting a model of negative feedback downstream of PREX1 activation. We also found that the phosphorylation of PREX1 after isoproterenol and prostaglandin E2-mediated GPCR activation is partially PAK-dependent and likely also involves protein kinase A, which is known to reduce PREX1 function.

The Rho family of GTPases, part of the Ras superfamily, contains multiple subgroups, including the Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac), cell division control protein 42 homolog (CDC42), and Rho-like GTPases (1Rojas A.M.

While in the GTP bound state, Rho GTPases can then bind to their downstream effectors, which activate many intracellular signaling pathways. For example, Rac1-GTP binds and activates the p21-activated kinases (PAKs), which are critical for cell motility, survival, and proliferation (3King H. Nicholas N.S. Wells C.M.

PIP3 is the product of class I PI3K activation downstream of both receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and Gβγ is released following GPCR activation. Given that PREX1 and PREX2 are activated in the same manner, it is important to identify the similarities and differences in their physiological functions and regulatory mechanisms.

In the brain, where both PREX2 and PREX1 are expressed, there does appear to be some redundancy in function. Prex2−/− mice show motor function deficiencies that are exacerbated in Prex1−/−Prex2−/− mice despite the fact that Prex1−/− mice do not show these defects (16Donald S. Humby T. Fyfe I.

This suggests that PREX1 can partially compensate for the loss of PREX2 and that these two proteins can potentially work in similar pathways. Given the importance of RTKs and GPCRs in mediating numerous signaling outputs in multiple cell types, PREX proteins are uniquely positioned to impact many cellular processes.

Additionally, PREX1 appears to have a specific role in metastasis. The expression of PREX1, but not a GEF-dead mutant, induces spontaneous metastasis in a xenograft prostate cancer mouse model (24Qin J. Xie Y. Wang B. Hoshino M. Wolff D.W. Zhao J.

PREX2 is also overexpressed in numerous cancer types and is frequently mutated in cancer, with especially high mutation rates in melanoma (25Gao J. Aksoy B.A. Dogrusoz U. Dresdner G. Gross B.

Furthermore, certain mutations can also evade PTEN-mediated inhibition of PREX2-driven breast cancer cell invasion (29Mense S.M. Barrows D. Hodakoski C. Steinbach N. Schoenfeld D. Su W. Hopkins B.D.

Although PREX1 is clearly important for the physiological outputs of receptor-activated signaling and in cancer, important questions remain regarding how its GEF activity is regulated downstream of receptor activation, particularly by phosphorylation. It is known that PREX1 is phosphorylated in the cell, demonstrated by the fact that after gel electrophoresis, it is detected as multiple bands that are collapsed by both λ-phosphatase and protein phosphatase 1α (PP1α) (30Barber M.A. Hendrickx A.

Importantly, PREX1 is phosphorylated after the activation of specific RTKs and GPCRs, indicating that the regulation of PREX1 by phosphorylation has a role in these signaling pathways. The stimulation of β-adrenergic GPCRs with isoproterenol results in the phosphorylation of PREX1, which is likely due to the activation of PKA downstream of the β-adrenergic receptor (31Mayeenuddin L.H. Garrison J.C. Phosphorylation of P-Rex1 by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase inhibits the phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate and Gβγ-mediated regulation of its activity.J. Biol.

Similarly, downstream of sphingosine 1-phosphate, PKA phosphorylates PREX1 to regulate an intramolecular interaction that reduces PREX1 GEF activity (49Chávez-Vargas L. Adame-García S.R.

Additionally, PREX1 is phosphorylated after the stimulation of RTKs with neuregulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), platelet-derived growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor, but the kinases that are responsible for these phosphorylation events are not known (18Montero J.C. Seoane S. Ocaña A. Pandiella A.

We recently identified PAKs as mediators of the phosphorylation of PREX2 after insulin receptor activation. PAK-dependent phosphorylation of PREX2, which occurs downstream of Rac activation, reduces PIP3 and Gβγ binding as well as PIP3 and Gβγ-stimulated PREX2 GEF activity, suggesting that these phosphorylation events are part of a negative feedback circuit to reduce Rac activation after insulin stimulation (33Barrows D. Schoenfeld S.M. Hodakoski C. Silkov A. Honig B. Couvillon A. Shymanets A. Nürnberg B. Asara J.M. Parsons R. p21-activated kinases (PAKs) mediate the phosphorylation of PREX2 protein to initiate feedback inhibition of Rac1 GTPase.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 28915-28931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that PREX1 is phosphorylated after insulin treatment of breast cancer cells and that insulin, neuregulin, and IGF1-mediated phosphorylation of PREX1 are PI3K- and PAK-dependent. Importantly, phosphorylated PREX1 does not efficiently bind to PIP3, and the activation of PREX1 GEF activity by PIP3 is reduced when PREX1 is phosphorylated in cells that co-express PAK1. Last, we identified a GPCR ligand, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), that can induce PREX1 phosphorylation, and we found that PGE2 and isoproterenol both stimulate PAK-dependent phosphorylation events on PREX1. Altogether, we show that PREX1 and PREX2 are both similarly regulated by phosphorylation downstream of RTKs through a PAK-dependent mechanism, demonstrating that negative feedback on these GEFs could have a significant impact on Rho GTPase function. PREX1 is phosphorylated downstream of neuregulin and IGF1 (18Montero J.C. Seoane S. Ocaña A. Pandiella A.

https://openalex.org/W2484547301,"We describe the sampling of sixty-three uncultured hospital air samples collected over a six-month period and analysis using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Our primary goals were to determine the longitudinal metagenomic variability of this environment, identify and characterize genomes of potential pathogens and determine whether they are atypical to the hospital airborne metagenome. Air samples were collected from eight locations which included patient wards, the main lobby and outside. The resulting DNA libraries produced 972 million sequences representing 51 gigabases. Hierarchical clustering of samples by the most abundant 50 microbial orders generated three major nodes which primarily clustered by type of location. Because the indoor locations were longitudinally consistent, episodic relative increases in microbial genomic signatures related to the opportunistic pathogens Aspergillus, Penicillium and Stenotrophomonas were identified as outliers at specific locations. Further analysis of microbial reads specific for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia indicated homology to a sequenced multi-drug resistant clinical strain and we observed broad sequence coverage of resistance genes. We demonstrate that a shotgun metagenomic sequencing approach can be used to characterize the resistance determinants of pathogen genomes that are uncharacteristic for an otherwise consistent hospital air microbial metagenomic profile."

At present, little information is available regarding the role of miRNAs in response to replanting disease. In this study, two small RNA libraries obtained from first-year (FPR) and second-year plant (SPR) roots were subjected to a high-throughput sequencing method. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that 110 known and 7 novel miRNAs were annotated in the roots of S. miltiorrhiza. Moreover, 39 known and 2 novel miRNAs were identified and validated for differential expression in FPR compared with SPR. Thirty-one of these miRNAs were further analyzed by qRT-PCR, which revealed that 5 miRNAs negatively regulated the expression levels of 7 target genes involved in root development or stress responses. This study not only provides novel insights into the miRNA content of S. miltiorrhiza in response to replanting disease but also demonstrates that 5 miRNAs may be involved in these responses. Interactions among the differentially expressed miRNAs with their targets may form an important component of the molecular basis of replanting disease in S. miltiorrhiza."
https://openalex.org/W2489304509,"In order to behave adaptively, attention can be directed in space either voluntarily (i.e., endogenously) according to strategic goals, or involuntarily (i.e., exogenously) through reflexive capture by salient or novel events. The emotional or motivational value of stimuli can also strongly influence attentional orienting. However, little is known about how reward-related effects compete or interact with endogenous and exogenous attention mechanisms, particularly outside of awareness. Here we developed a visual search paradigm to study subliminal value-based attentional orienting. We systematically manipulated goal-directed or stimulus-driven attentional orienting and examined whether an irrelevant, but previously rewarded stimulus could compete with both types of spatial attention during search. Critically, reward was learned without conscious awareness in a preceding phase where one among several visual symbols was consistently paired with a subliminal monetary reinforcement cue. Our results demonstrated that symbols previously associated with a monetary reward received higher attentional priority in the subsequent visual search task, even though these stimuli and reward were no longer task-relevant, and despite reward being unconsciously acquired. Thus, motivational processes operating independent of conscious awareness may provide powerful influences on mechanisms of attentional selection, which could mitigate both stimulus-driven and goal-directed shifts of attention."

To date, the precise pathogenesis of SLE still remains obscure; however, increasing evidence indicates that the excessive inflammation caused by immune complex deposition may play a key role in the progress of SLE (5Rekvig O.P.

By far, the mainstay therapeutic strategy for SLE is the usage of glucocorticoids (GCs) (6Luijten R.K. Fritsch-Stork R.D. Bijlsma J.W. Derksen R.H.

GCs are small lipophilic compounds, which are well known to inhibit the pro-inflammatory responses, and are used in the treatment of many immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (8Rhen T.

Mechanisms and resistance in glucocorticoid control of inflammation.J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2010; 120: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar); nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain elusive. Further deciphering the mechanisms whereby GCs suppress inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the inflammatory responses in SLE disease and may facilitate the development of new anti-inflammatory agents in the future. As GCs may cause some side effects (such as osteoporosis, skin atrophy, and glaucoma) in a time- and dose-dependent manner (10Stanbury R.M. Graham E.M.

FOXO3a belongs to a family of forkhead box class O (FOXO) transcription factors, which are involved in diverse physiopathological processes, such as metabolism, apoptosis, oxidative stress resistance, and senescence. In mammals, there are four FOXO proteins, FOXO1, FOXO3a, FOXO4, and FOXO6. FOXO1, FOXO3, and FOXO4 are widely distributed and are expressed in most tissues, whereas FOXO6 expression is largely restricted to neural cells (13Morris B.J. Willcox D.C. Donlon T.A. Willcox B.J.

In recent years, accumulating evidence has demonstrated the critical roles of several FOXO family members in immunoregulation, although their function may be diverse and in some cases even antagonistic (15Calnan D.R.

For example, FOXO1 has often been showed to activate NF-κB (19Kim D.H. Kim J.Y. Yu B.P. Chung H.Y.

Of interest, it is also suggested that FOXO3a may be involved in some GC-mediated biological processes (27Ma J. Xie Y. Shi Y. Qin W. Zhao B. Jin Y.

Using protein antibody array and Western blotting analysis, we found that FOXO3a was down-regulated in the course of SLE, which could be reversed by treatment with GCs. Of importance, FOXO3a was revealed to play a crucial role in GC treatment of SLE via inhibiting pro-inflammatory responses. Further studies showed that the up-regulation of FOXO3a by GCs relied on the suppression of FOXO3a phosphorylation and its ensuing degradation in cytoplasm. Moreover, it was found that the nucleus-arrested FOXO3a played an important role in GC-mediated inhibition of NF-κB activity, which might involve its interaction with NF-κB p65 protein. A total of 21 patients (male/female, 2/19; median age, 42 years) with SLE and 12 age- and gender-matched healthy individuals (male/female 1/11; median age, 41 years) were recruited. All patients took prednisone (0.5–1 mg/kg/day orally) as part of their routine therapy for 4 weeks in combination with oral hydroxychloroquine or other immunosuppressants to achieve a smooth reduction in GC dosage after 4 weeks. After the 4-week GCs treatment, the peripheral blood samples and urine samples were collected from SLE patients after informed consent. The diagnosis of SLE was established according to the 1982 revised American College of Rheumatology criteria (29Tan E.M. Cohen A.S. Fries J.F. Masi A.T. McShane D.J. Rothfield N.F. Schaller J.G.

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Fudan University and performed in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. Six-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free room under controlled temperature and humidity. All animal experiments were conducted according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Medical Laboratory Animals (Ministry of Health, People's Republic of China, 1998) and with the approval of the Ethical Committee of Fudan University (Shanghai, People's Republic of China). RAW264.7 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Primary peritoneal macrophages were obtained from 6-week-old female BALB/c mice and were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. For the preparation of renal macrophages, murine renal tissues were dispersed in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FBS and 0.1% collagenase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by progressive sieving to obtain single-cell suspensions. The CD11b+/F4/80 high macrophages were further sorted from single-cell suspensions using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences) with FITC-labeled anti-F4/80 and phycoerythrin-labeled anti-CD11b (BD Biosciences). The purity of cells was more than 90%, as determined by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences). Activated lymphocyte-derived apoptotic DNA (ALD-DNA) and unactivated lymphocyte-derived DNA (UnALD-DNA) extraction and purification were performed as described previously (30Qiao B. Wu J. Chu Y.W.

In brief, for the generation of activated lymphocyte-derived apoptotic DNA (ALD-DNA), splenocytes from 6- to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice were seeded at 2 × 106 cells/ml in 75-cm2 cell culture flasks and cultured for 6 days in the presence of concanavalin A (5 mg/ml) to induce apoptosis. The apoptotic cells were stained with FITC-labeled annexin V (BD Biosciences) and propidium iodide (Sigma) and then sorted using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences). Genomic DNAs from syngeneic apoptotic splenocytes were treated with S1 nuclease (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) and proteinase K (Sigma) and then purified using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unactivated lymphocyte-derived DNA (UnALD-DNA) was extracted from unactivated (resting) splenocytes using the same methods. The SLE murine model was generated as described previously (30Qiao B. Wu J.

Briefly, 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were immunized s.c. with ALD-DNA (50 μg/mouse) plus complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) on day 1, followed by s.c. injection of ALD-DNA (50 μg/mouse) emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) on days 14 and 28 for a total of three times. Serum and urine samples were collected every 2nd week for further experiments. Eight weeks after initial immunization, mice were sacrificed, and kidneys were collected for further cellular function and tissue histology analysis. The protein expression profiles of ALD-DNA-stimulated RAW264.7 cells in the absence or presence of GCs were analyzed using an antibody array kit (Full Moon Biosystem, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Briefly, protein samples obtained from RAW264.7 cells were biotinylated using biotin reagent dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide. Biotin-labeled protein samples were then conjugated to the antibody microarray slides, followed by incubation with FITC-streptavidin solution. Slides were scanned using the GenePix 4000 Array Scanner, and the images were analyzed with GenePix Pro 6.0 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To down-regulate the FOXO3a expression in RAW264.7 cells, cells were transfected with FOXO3a-specific siRNA (catalogue number 6302; Cell Signaling Technology) using mouse macrophage nucleofector kit (Lonza Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To inhibit the FOXO3a expression in lupus mice, 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were randomized for injection with siFOXO3a or siControl using in vivo-jetPEITM (Polyplus Transfection, Strasbourg, France) every other 3 days for 6 weeks as described previously (33Chen M. Zhang W. Xu W. Zhang F. Xiong S. Blockade of TLR9 signaling in B cells impaired anti-dsDNA antibody production in mice induced by activated syngeneic lymphocyte-derived DNA immunization.Mol.

In brief, 24 h after the initial siFOXO3a or siControl treatment, mice were immunized with ALD-DNA (50 μg/mouse), UnALD-DNA (50 μg/mouse), or PBS three times in 4 weeks. Eight weeks after initial immunization, mice were sacrificed, and surgically resected kidneys were collected for further cellular function and tissue histology analysis. Adenoviruses encoding FOXO3a (Ad-FOXO3a) and the control (Ad-Control) were obtained from Hanheng Biological Technology (Shanghai, China). The adenovirus delivery in mice was performed as described previously (39Gui J. Yue Y. Chen R. Xu W. Xiong S. A20 (TNFAIP3) alleviates CVB3-induced myocarditis via inhibiting NF-kappaB signaling.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e46515Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To examine the therapeutic effects of FOXO3a, each mouse received an intravenous injection of 100 μl of Ad-FOXO3a or Ad-Control (3 × 109 plaque-forming units, pfu) 2 days before ALD-DNA immunization. For the detection of anti-dsDNA levels, ELISA plates were pretreated with protamine sulfate (Sigma) and then coated with calf thymus dsDNA (Sigma). After incubation with mouse sera, levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies were examined with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL), followed by the measurement of enzymatic color reaction at 450 nm. Proteinuria of the mice was determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To assess the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 in sera or the cell culture supernatants, ELISAs were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (eBioscience, San Diego). Murine renal tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), processed, and coated in paraffin. H&E staining of renal tissue sections was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions and assessed by a pathologist blinded to treatment group. The kidney score of glomerulonephritis was determined by using the ISN/RPS2003 classification (40Weening J.J. D'Agati V.D. Schwartz M.M. Seshan S.V. Alpers C.E. Appel G.B. Balow J.E. Bruijn J.A.

Pictures were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with magnification ×200. Fluorescent staining of cryosections was used for autoantibody deposition analysis in the glomeruli. Sections were fixed in acetone for 10 min and incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (catalogue number sc-2010; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or FITC-conjugated C3 antibody (catalogue number orb102204; Biorbyt Corp., Cambridgeshire, UK) for 30 min. Pictures were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with magnification ×200. Paraffin-embedded kidney tissue sections were cut at 4 μm, placed on 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-pretreated slides. Sections were then deparaffinized and rehydrated according to the standard protocol. For immunohistochemistry analysis, sections were incubated with anti-Hexon (catalogue number LS-C63694; LSBio, Seattle, WA) or anti-FOXO3a (catalogue number 2497; Cell Signaling Technology), followed by the incubation of biotin-labeled secondary antibody and avidin-biotin complex. Peroxidase stain was developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine solution and counterstained with hematoxylin. Pictures were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with magnification ×200. The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 DNA binding assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (catalogue number 10007889; Cayman Chemical Co.). Briefly, 10 μg of nuclear extract, diluted to 100 μl, was added to the wells coated with oligonucleotides containing the NF-κB consensus binding site. For the detection of activated NF-κB, antibodies against the p65 were used, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The colorimetric readout (450 nm) was done with an ELISA plate reader (Thermo Scientific). Western blotting assay and coimmunoprecipitation assay were performed as described previously (41Gao B.

Antibodies against β-actin (catalogue number sc-130300), tubulin (catalogue number sc-9104), and lamin B (catalogue number sc-374015) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against p-FOXO3a (catalogue number 13129), FOXO3a (catalogue number 2497), p-NF-κB p65 (catalogue number 3033), NF-κB p65 (catalogue number 4765), p-IκBα (catalogue number 2859), IκBα (catalogue number 4812), p-Akt (catalogue number 9721), Akt (catalogue number 9272), p-JNK (catalogue number 9251), p-ERK1/2 (catalogue number 9101), and p-p38 (catalogue number 9211) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Experimental data were presented as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. The Student's t test was used to compare differences between two groups, whereas comparison of multiple groups was performed using analysis of variance with post hoc tests to compare differences between individual groups. Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the association between GC therapy of SLE and the pro-inflammatory responses. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Data were entered and analyzed using a statistical software package (SPSS18.0). To investigate the therapeutic effect of GCs on SLE patients, we detected the clinical indicators of SLE patients before and after GC treatment. It was found that after GC treatment, levels of serum anti-dsDNA antibody (Fig. 1A) and urine protein (Fig. 1B) were decreased; the serum C3 level (Fig. 1C) was elevated; and the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) (Fig. 1D) was significantly attenuated. We also tested the therapeutic effect of GCs on SLE using a mouse model, which was established by immunized female BALB/c with an autoantigen, activated lymphocyte-derived apoptotic DNA (ALD-DNA), as described previously (30Qiao B.

https://openalex.org/W2497371205,"Background Treatment strategy for early gastric cancer depends on the probability of lymph node metastasis. The aim of this study is to develop a nomogram predicting lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer using clinicopathological factors and biomarkers. Methods A literature review was performed to identify biomarkers related to lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer. Seven markers were selected and immunohistochemistry was performed in 336 early gastric cancer tissues. Based on the multivariable analysis, a prediction model including clinicopatholgical factors and biomarkers was developed, and benefit of adding biomarkers was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating curve and net reclassification improvement. Functional study in gastric cancer cell line was performed to evaluate mechanism of biomarker. Results Of the seven biomarkers studied, α1 catenin and CD44v6 were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis. A conventional prediction model, including tumor size, histological type, lymphatic blood vessel invasion, and depth of invasion, was developed. Then, a new prediction model including both clinicopathological factors and CD44v6 was developed. Net reclassification improvement analysis revealed a significant improvement of predictive performance by the addition of CD44v6, and a similar result was shown in the internal validation using bootstrapping. Prediction nomograms were then constructed based on these models. In the functional study, CD44v6 was revealed to affect cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Conclusions Overexpression of CD44v6 was a significant predictor of lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer. The prediction nomograms incorporating CD44v6 can be useful to determine treatment plans in patients with early gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2478068888,"The Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) is a widely used measure of health and social functioning of people with mental illness. The goals of this study were to verify the internal validity of the one factor and several four-factor scoring structures and to evaluate the predictive validity of HoNOS items with regards to duration of hospitalization, probability of readmission in the following year and time before readmission. 6175 hospital stays at the department of psychiatry of Lausanne University Hospital were screened and the first HoNOS of each patient was taken into account (N = 2722). Data were analyzed through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and the predictive validity of HoNOS items was evaluated with two approaches: item level regressions and latent class analysis (LCA). CFA indicated that the suggested factor structures were not supported by the data. Predictive validity of the 12 items was weak but LCA revealed five distinct and meaningful profiles that were related to length of stay or readmission. HoNOS may be more adapted to the evaluation of patients case-mix rather than to the individual level and concepts such as predictive validity may be more appropriate than internal validity to guide its use."
https://openalex.org/W2490155739,"Childhood onset epilepsy is associated with disrupted developmental integration of sensorimotor and cognitive functions that contribute to persistent neurobehavioural comorbidities. The role of epilepsy and its treatment on the development of functional integration of motor and cognitive domains is unclear. Oculomotor tasks can probe neurophysiological and neurocognitive mechanisms vulnerable to developmental disruptions by epilepsy-related factors. The study involved 26 patients and 48 typically developing children aged 8–18 years old who performed a prosaccade and an antisaccade task. Analyses compared medicated chronic epilepsy patients and unmedicated controlled epilepsy patients to healthy control children on saccade latency, accuracy and dynamics, errors and correction rate, and express saccades. Patients with medicated chronic epilepsy had impaired and more variable processing speed, reduced accuracy, increased peak velocity and a greater number of inhibitory errors, younger unmedicated patients also showed deficits in error monitoring. Deficits were related to reported behavioural problems in patients. Epilepsy factors were significant predictors of oculomotor functions. An earlier age at onset predicted reduced latency of prosaccades and increased express saccades, and the typical relationship between express saccades and inhibitory errors was absent in chronic patients, indicating a persistent reduction in tonic cortical inhibition and aberrant cortical connectivity. In contrast, onset in later childhood predicted altered antisaccade dynamics indicating disrupted neurotransmission in frontoparietal and oculomotor networks with greater demand on inhibitory control. The observed saccadic abnormalities are consistent with a dysmaturation of subcortical-cortical functional connectivity and aberrant neurotransmission. Eye movements could be used to monitor the impact of epilepsy on neurocognitive development and help assess the risk for poor neurobehavioural outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2506554498,"Commensal and pathogenic enteric bacteria have developed several systems to adapt to proton leakage into the cytoplasm resulting from extreme acidic conditions. One such system involves arginine uptake followed by export of the decarboxylated product agmatine, carried out by the arginine/agmatine antiporter (AdiC), which thus works as a virtual proton pump. Here, using classical and targeted molecular dynamics, we investigated at the atomic level the mechanism of arginine transport through AdiC of E. coli. Overall, our MD simulation data clearly demonstrate that global rearrangements of several transmembrane segments are necessary but not sufficient for achieving transitions between structural states along the arginine translocation pathway. In particular, local structural changes, namely rotameric conversions of two aromatic residues, are needed to regulate access to both the outward- and inward-facing states. Our simulations have also enabled identification of a few residues, overwhelmingly aromatic, which are essential to guiding arginine in the course of its translocation. Most of them belong to gating elements whose coordinated motions contribute to the alternating access mechanism. Their conservation in all known E. coli acid resistance antiporters suggests that the transport mechanisms of these systems share common features. Last but not least, knowledge of the functional properties of AdiC can advance our understanding of the members of the amino acid-carbocation-polyamine superfamily, notably in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2486101759,"As targeted therapy becomes increasingly important, diagnostic techniques for identifying targeted biomarkers have also become an emerging issue. The study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating patients as guided by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status compared with a no-testing strategy that is the current clinical practice in South Korea.A cost-utility analysis was conducted to compare an EGFR mutation testing strategy with a no-testing strategy from the Korean healthcare payer's perspective. The study population consisted of patients with stage 3b and 4 lung adenocarcinoma. A decision tree model was employed to select the appropriate treatment regimen according to the results of EGFR mutation testing and a Markov model was constructed to simulate disease progression of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The length of a Markov cycle was one month, and the time horizon was five years (60 cycles).In the base case analysis, the testing strategy was a dominant option. Quality-adjusted life-years gained (QALYs) were 0.556 and 0.635, and total costs were $23,952 USD and $23,334 USD in the no-testing and testing strategy respectively. The sensitivity analyses showed overall robust results. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) increased when the number of patients to be treated with erlotinib increased, due to the high cost of erlotinib.Treating advanced adenocarcinoma based on EGFR mutation status has beneficial effects and saves the cost compared to no testing strategy in South Korea. However, the cost-effectiveness of EGFR mutation testing was heavily affected by the cost-effectiveness of the targeted therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2486855341,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genetic regions involved in immune-regulatory mechanisms to be associated with celiac disease. Previous GWAS also revealed an over-representation of genes involved in type 2 diabetes and anorexia nervosa associated with celiac disease, suggesting involvement of common metabolic pathways for development of these chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to extend these previous analyses to study the gene expression in the gut from children with active celiac disease.Thirty six target genes involved in type 2 diabetes and four genes associated with anorexia nervosa were investigated for gene expression in small intestinal biopsies from 144 children with celiac disease at median (range) age of 7.4 years (1.6-17.8) and from 154 disease controls at a median (range) age 11.4.years (1.4-18.3).A total of eleven of genes were differently expressed in celiac patients compared with disease controls of which CD36, CD38, FOXP1, SELL, PPARA, PPARG, AGT previously associated with type 2 diabetes and AKAP6, NTNG1 with anorexia nervosa remained significant after correction for multiple testing.Shared genetic factors involved in celiac disease, type 2 diabetes and anorexia nervosa suggest common underlying molecular pathways for these diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2488087716,"Olfactory dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), which is a risk factor in the development of PD. However, a few studies have conflicting results when comparing dysosmia in the patients with iRBD and PD. There is no study investigating the olfactory function in Chinese patients with iRBD. Additionally, the Sniffin' Sticks screening 12 test (SS-12) contains several odors that are not familiar to people in different cultures.Odor identification was evaluated in iRBD patients (n = 54), PD patients (n = 54) and healthy controls (n = 54). With the identification data, a brief odor identification test was established and then validated in other subjects.Odor identification scores in iRBD patients were significantly higher than those in PD patients (P<0.001) but lower than those in controls (P<0.001). At the cut-off value of 7.5, the Sniffin' Sticks clearly differentiated iRBD and PD patients from the controls, and the brief test could increase the specificity in diagnosing PD. Neither the Sniffin' Sticks nor the brief test could clearly differentiate PD and iRBD patients from each other.Olfaction is more impaired in PD patients than in iRBD patients, possibly due to the heterogeneity of iRBD patients. The Sniffin' Sticks could be a useful tool for differentiating iRBD patients from the healthy population, and it could be useful for screening people at high-risk of PD in China, especially when combined with polysomnography. To reduce the expense and time required for the Sniffin' Sticks test, this study shows that a brief test is feasible."
https://openalex.org/W2494981292,"Background The BD FACSPresto™ Near-Patient CD4 Counter was developed to expand HIV/AIDS management in resource-limited settings. It measures absolute CD4 counts (AbsCD4), percent CD4 (%CD4), and hemoglobin (Hb) from a single drop of capillary or venous blood in approximately 23 minutes, with throughput of 10 samples per hour. We assessed the performance of the BD FACSPresto system, evaluating accuracy, stability, linearity, precision, and reference intervals using capillary and venous blood at KEMRI/CDC HIV-research laboratory, Kisumu, Kenya, and precision and linearity at BD Biosciences, California, USA. Methods For accuracy, venous samples were tested using the BD FACSCalibur™ instrument with BD Tritest™ CD3/CD4/CD45 reagent, BD Trucount™ tubes, and BD Multiset™ software for AbsCD4 and %CD4, and the Sysmex™ KX-21N for Hb. Stability studies evaluated duration of staining (18–120-minute incubation), and effects of venous blood storage <6–24 hours post-draw. A normal cohort was tested for reference intervals. Precision covered multiple days, operators, and instruments. Linearity required mixing two pools of samples, to obtain evenly spaced concentrations for AbsCD4, total lymphocytes, and Hb. Results AbsCD4 and %CD4 venous/capillary (N = 189/ N = 162) accuracy results gave Deming regression slopes within 0.97–1.03 and R2 ≥0.96. For Hb, Deming regression results were R2 ≥0.94 and slope ≥0.94 for both venous and capillary samples. Stability varied within 10% 2 hours after staining and for venous blood stored less than 24 hours. Reference intervals results showed that gender—but not age—differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). Precision results had <3.5% coefficient of variation for AbsCD4, %CD4, and Hb, except for low AbsCD4 samples (<6.8%). Linearity was 42–4,897 cells/μL for AbsCD4, 182–11,704 cells/μL for total lymphocytes, and 2–24 g/dL for Hb. Conclusions The BD FACSPresto system provides accurate, precise clinical results for capillary or venous blood samples and is suitable for near-patient CD4 testing.

https://openalex.org/W2485110194,"Although disgust has been implicated in moral judgments, the extent to which the influence of disgust on moral judgment is distinct from other negative affective states remains unclear. To address this gap in knowledge, participants in Study 1 were randomized to a disgust (hand submersion in imitation vomit), discomfort (hand submersion in ice water), or neutral (hand submersion in room temperature water) affect condition while moral judgments of offenses were simultaneously assessed. The results showed that participants in the discomfort condition made the most severe moral judgments, particularly for moderate offenses. To examine if disgust may have more of an effect on some moral violations than others, participants in Study 2 were randomized to similar affect inductions while judgments of purity and non-purity offenses were simultaneously assessed. The results showed that those who had their hand submerged in imitation vomit recommended harsher punishment for purity violations relative to moral violations unrelated to purity. The opposite was true for those who submerged their hands in ice water, whereas punishment ratings for purity and non-purity violations did not significantly differ for those who submerged their hands in room temperature water. The implications of these findings for further delineating the specific role of experienced disgust in moral decision-making are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2488368456,"Purpose The endothelins are a family of three highly conserved and homologous vasoactive peptides that are expressed across all organ systems. Endothelin (Edn) dysregulation has been implicated in a number of pathophysiologies, including diabetes and diabetes-related complications. Here we examined Edn2 and endothelin receptor B (Endrb) expression in retinae of diabetic mouse models and measured serum Edn2 to assess its biomarker potential. Materials and Methods Edn2 and Ednrb mRNA and Edn2 protein expression were assessed in young (8wk) and mature (24wk) C57Bl/6 (wild type; wt), Kimba (model of retinal neovascularisation, RNV), Akita (Type 1 diabetes; T1D) and Akimba mice (T1D plus RNV) by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Edn2 protein concentration in serum was measured using ELISA. Results Fold-changes in Edn2 and Ednrb mRNA were seen only in young Kimba (Edn2: 5.3; Ednrb: 6.0) and young Akimba (Edn2: 7.9, Ednrb: 8.8) and in mature Kimba (Edn2:9.2, Ednrb:11.2) and mature Akimba (Edn2:14.0, Ednrb:17.5) mice. Co-localisation of Edn2 with Müller-cell-specific glutamine synthetase demonstrated Müller cells and photoreceptors as the major cell types for Edn2 expression in all animal models. Edn2 serum concentrations in young Kimba, Akita and Akimba mice were not elevated compared to wt. However, in mature mice, Edn2 serum concentration was increased in Akimba (6.9pg/mg total serum protein) compared to wt, Kimba and Akita mice (3.9, 4.6, and 3.8pg/mg total serum protein, respectively; p<0.05). Conclusions These results demonstrated that long-term hyperglycaemia in conjunction with VEGF-driven RNV increased Edn2 serum concentration suggesting Edn2 might be a candidate biomarker for vascular changes in diabetic retinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2489145332,"Sequence homology searches are used in various fields and require large amounts of computation time, especially for metagenomic analysis, owing to the large number of queries and the database size. To accelerate computing analyses, graphics processing units (GPUs) are widely used as a low-cost, high-performance computing platform. Therefore, we mapped the time-consuming steps involved in GHOSTZ, which is a state-of-the-art homology search algorithm for protein sequences, onto a GPU and implemented it as GHOSTZ-GPU. In addition, we optimized memory access for GPU calculations and for communication between the CPU and GPU. As per results of the evaluation test involving metagenomic data, GHOSTZ-GPU with 12 CPU threads and 1 GPU was approximately 3.0- to 4.1-fold faster than GHOSTZ with 12 CPU threads. Moreover, GHOSTZ-GPU with 12 CPU threads and 3 GPUs was approximately 5.8- to 7.7-fold faster than GHOSTZ with 12 CPU threads."
https://openalex.org/W2480516760,"This study aimed to evaluate changes in glucose metabolism at the early stage and onset of diabetes in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats. Specifically, after the oral administration of [1, 2, 3-13C]glucose, the levels of exhaled 13CO2, which most likely originated from pyruvate decarboxylation and tricarboxylic acid, were measured. Eight OLETF rats and eight control rats (Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka [LETO]) were administered 13C-glucose. Three types of 13C-glucose breath tests were performed thrice in each period at 2-week intervals. [3-13C]glucose results in a 13C isotope at position 1 in the pyruvate molecule, which provides 13CO2. The 13C at carbons 1 and 2 of glucose is converted to 13C at carbons 2 and 1 of acetate, respectively, which produce 13CO2. Based on metabolic differences of the labeled sites, glucose metabolism was evaluated using the results of three breath tests. The increase in 13CO2 excretion in OLETF rats was delayed in all three breath tests compared to that in control rats, suggesting that OLETF rats had a lower glucose metabolism than control rats. In addition, overall glucose metabolism increased with age in both groups. The utilization of [2-13C]glucose was suppressed in OLETF rats at 6-12 weeks of age, but they showed higher [3-13C]glucose oxidation than control rats at 22-25 weeks of age. In the [1-13C]glucose breath test, no significant differences in the area under the curve until 180 minutes (AUC180) were observed between OLETF and LETO rats of any age. Glucose metabolism kinetics were different between the age groups and two groups of rats; however, these differences were not significant based on the overall AUC180 of [1-13C]glucose. We conclude that breath 13CO2 excretion is reduced in OLETF rats at the primary stage of prediabetes, indicating differences in glucose oxidation kinetics between OLETF and LETO rats."
https://openalex.org/W2495026872,"Netrin-1 is an essential extracellular chemoattractant that signals through its receptor DCC to guide commissural axon extension in the embryonic spinal cord. DCC directs the organization of F-actin in growth cones by activating an intracellular protein complex that includes the Rho GTPase Cdc42, a critical regulator of cell polarity and directional migration. To address the spatial distribution of signaling events downstream of netrin-1, we expressed the FRET biosensor Raichu-Cdc42 in cultured embryonic rat spinal commissural neurons. Using FLIM-FRET imaging we detected rapid activation of Cdc42 in neuronal growth cones following application of netrin-1. Investigating the signaling mechanisms that control Cdc42 activation by netrin-1, we demonstrate that netrin-1 rapidly enriches DCC at the leading edge of commissural neuron growth cones and that netrin-1 induced activation of Cdc42 in the growth cone is blocked by inhibiting src family kinase signaling. These findings reveal the activation of Cdc42 in embryonic spinal commissural axon growth cones and support the conclusion that src family kinase activation downstream of DCC is required for Cdc42 activation by netrin-1."
https://openalex.org/W2478254560,"In canonical Wnt signaling, the protein levels of the key signaling mediator β-catenin are under tight regulation by the multimeric destruction complex that mediates proteasomal degradation of β-catenin. In colorectal cancer, destruction complex activity is often compromised due to mutations in the multifunctional scaffolding protein Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC), leading to a stabilization of β-catenin. Recently, tankyrase inhibitors (TNKSi), a novel class of small molecule inhibitors, were shown to re-establish a functional destruction complex in APC-mutant cancer cell lines by stabilizing AXIN1/2, whose protein levels are usually kept low via poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by the tankyrase enzymes (TNKS1/2). Surprisingly, we found that for the formation of the morphological correlates of destruction complexes, called degradasomes, functional proteasomes are required. In addition we found that AXIN2 is strongly upregulated after 6 h of TNKS inhibition. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 counteracted TNKSi-induced degradasome formation and AXIN2 stabilization, and this was accompanied by reduced transcription of AXIN2. Mechanistically we could implicate the transcription factor FoxM1 in this process, which was recently shown to be a transcriptional activator of AXIN2. We observed a substantial reduction in TNKSi-induced stabilization of AXIN2 after siRNA-mediated depletion of FoxM1 and found that proteasome inhibition reduced the active (phosphorylated) fraction of FoxM1. This can explain the decreased protein levels of AXIN2 after MG132 treatment. Our findings have implications for the design of in vitro studies on the destruction complex and for clinical applications of TNKSi."
https://openalex.org/W2499005143,"Chemokine stimulation of integrin α4β1-dependent T lymphocyte adhesion is a key step during lymphocyte trafficking. A central question regarding α4β1 function is how its lateral mobility and organization influence its affinity and avidity following cell stimulation with chemokines and/or ligands. Using single particle tracking and superresolution imaging approaches, we explored the lateral mobility and spatial arrangement of individual α4β1integrins on T cells exposed to different activating stimuli. We show that CXCL12 stimulation leads to rapid and transient α4β1activation, measured by induction of the activation epitope recognized by the HUTS-21 anti-β1antibody and by increased talin-β1 association. CXCL12-dependent α4β1 activation directly correlated with restricted lateral diffusion and integrin immobilization. Moreover, co-stimulation by CXCL12 together with soluble VCAM-1 potentiated integrin immobilization with a 5-fold increase in immobile integrins compared with unstimulated conditions. Our data indicate that docking by talin of the chemokine-activated α4β1 to the actin cytoskeleton favors integrin immobilization, which likely facilitates ligand interaction and increased adhesiveness. Superresolution imaging showed that the nanoscale organization of high-affinity α4β1 remains unaffected following chemokine and/or ligand addition. Instead, newly activated α4β1 integrins organize on the cell membrane as independent units without joining pre-established integrin sites to contribute to cluster formation. Altogether, our results provide a rationale to understand how the spatiotemporal organization of activated α4β1 integrins regulates T lymphocyte adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2495606081,"The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and some predictors for vaccine and non-vaccine types of HPV infections among bivalent HPV vaccinated and non-vaccinated young women in Uganda. This was a comparative cross sectional study 5.5 years after a bivalent HPV 16/18 vaccination (Cervarix®, GlaxoSmithKline, Belgium) pilot project in western Uganda. Cervical swabs were collected between July 2014-August 2014 and analyzed with a HPV genotyping test, CLART® HPV2 assay (Genomica, Madrid Spain) which is based on PCR followed by microarray for determination of genotype. Blood samples were also tested for HIV and syphilis infections as well as CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte levels. The age range of the participants was 15–24 years and mean age was 18.6(SD 1.4). Vaccine-type HPV-16/18 strains were significantly less prevalent among vaccinated women compared to non-vaccinated women (0.5% vs 5.6%, p 0.006, OR 95% CI 0.08(0.01–0.64). At type-specific level, significant difference was observed for HPV16 only. Other STIs (HIV/syphilis) were important risk factors for HPV infections including both vaccine types and non-vaccine types. In addition, for non-vaccine HPV types, living in an urban area, having a low BMI, low CD4 count and having had a high number of life time sexual partners were also significant risk factors. Our data concurs with the existing literature from other parts of the world regarding the effectiveness of bivalent HPV-16/18 vaccine in reducing the prevalence of HPV infections particularly vaccine HPV- 16/18 strains among vaccinated women. This study reinforces the recommendation to vaccinate young girls before sexual debut and integrate other STI particularly HIV and syphilis interventions into HPV vaccination packages."
https://openalex.org/W2496451294,"The effect of humoral immunity on the composition of the oral microbiota is less intensively investigated than hygiene and diet, in part due to a lack of simple and robust systems for investigating interactions between salivary immunoglobulins and oral bacteria. Here we report the application of an ex situ method to investigate the specificity of salivary immunoglobulins for salivary bacteria. Saliva collected from six volunteers was separated into immunoglobulin and microbial fractions, and the microbial fractions were then directly exposed to salivary immunoglobulins of ""self"" and ""non-self"" origin. Antibody-selected bacteria were separated from their congeners using a magnetic bead system, selective for IgA or IgG isotypes. The positively selected fractions were then characterized using gel-based eubacterial-specific DNA profiling. The eubacterial profiles of positively selected fractions diverged significantly from profiles of whole salivary consortia based on volunteer (P≤ 0.001%) and immunoglobulin origin (P≤ 0.001%), but not immunoglobulin isotype (P = 0.2). DNA profiles of separated microbial fractions were significantly (p≤ 0.05) less diverse than whole salivary consortia and included oral and environmental bacteria. Consortia selected using self immunoglobulins were generally less diverse than those selected with immunoglobulins of non-self origin. Magnetic bead separation facilitated the testing of interactions between salivary antibodies and oral bacteria, showing that these interactions are specific and may reflect differences in recognition by self and non-self immunoglobulins. Further development of this system could improve understanding of the relationship between the oral microbiota and the host immune system and of mechanisms underlying the compositional stability of the oral microbiota."

https://openalex.org/W2483670053,"Herpes zoster (HZ) is a common condition that increases in incidence with older age but vaccines are available to prevent the disease. However, there are limited data estimating the health system burden attributable to herpes zoster by age.In this study, we quantified excess healthcare resource usage associated with HZ during the acute/sub-acute period of disease (21days before to 90 days after onset) in 5952 cases and an equal number of controls matched on age, sex, and prior healthcare resource usage. Estimates were adjusted for potential confounders in multivariable regression models. Using population-based estimates of HZ incidence, we calculated the age-specific excess number of health service usage events attributable to HZ in the population.Per HZ case, there was an average of 0.06 (95% CI 0.04-0.08) excess hospitalisations, 1.61 (95% CI 1.51-1.69) excess general practitioner visits, 1.96 (95% CI 1.86-2.15) excess prescriptions filled and 0.11 (95% CI 0.09-0.13) excess emergency department visits. The average number of healthcare resource use events, and the estimated excess per 100,000 population increased with increasing age but were similar for men and women, except for higher rates of hospitalisation in men. The excess annual HZ associated burden of hospitalisations was highest in adults ≥80 years (N = 2244, 95%CI 1719-2767); GP visits was highest in those 60-69 years (N = 50567, 95%CI 39958-61105), prescriptions and ED visits were highest in 70-79 years (N = 50524, 95%CI 40634-60471 and N = 2891, 95%CI 2319-3449 respectively).This study provides important data to establish the healthcare utilisation associated with HZ against which detailed cost-effectiveness analyses of HZ immunisation in older adults can be conducted."
https://openalex.org/W2496372198,"Agonist-activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) interact with GDP-bound G protein heterotrimers (Gαβγ) promoting GDP/GTP exchange, which results in dissociation of Gα from the receptor and Gβγ. The GTPase activity of Gα hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, and the GDP-bound Gα interacts with Gβγ, forming a GDP-bound G protein heterotrimer. The G protein cycle is allosterically modulated by conformational changes of the Gα subunit. Although biochemical and biophysical methods have elucidated the structure and dynamics of Gα, the precise conformational mechanisms underlying the G protein cycle are not fully understood yet. Simulation methods could help to provide additional details to gain further insight into G protein signal transduction mechanisms. In this study, using the available X-ray crystal structures of Gα, we simulated the entire G protein cycle and described not only the steric features of the Gα structure, but also conformational changes at each step. Each reference structure in the G protein cycle was modeled as an elastic network model and subjected to normal mode analysis. Our simulation data suggests that activated receptors trigger conformational changes of the Gα subunit that are thermodynamically favorable for opening of the nucleotide-binding pocket and GDP release. Furthermore, the effects of GTP binding and hydrolysis on mobility changes of the C and N termini and switch regions are elucidated. In summary, our simulation results enabled us to provide detailed descriptions of the structural and dynamic features of the G protein cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2501486123,"Transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) reconstitution and deconstruction occur simultaneously during reprogramming; however, it remains unclear how the starting and targeting TRNs regulate the induction and suppression of peripheral genes. Here we analyzed the regulation using direct cell reprogramming from human dermal fibroblasts to monocytes as the platform. We simultaneously deconstructed fibroblastic TRN and reconstituted monocytic TRN; monocytic and fibroblastic gene expression were analyzed in comparison with that of fibroblastic TRN deconstruction only or monocytic TRN reconstitution only. Global gene expression analysis showed cross-regulation of TRNs. Detailed analysis revealed that knocking down fibroblastic TRN positively affected half of the upregulated monocytic genes, indicating that intrinsic fibroblastic TRN interfered with the expression of induced genes. In contrast, reconstitution of monocytic TRN showed neutral effects on the majority of fibroblastic gene downregulation. This study provides an explicit example that demonstrates how two networks together regulate gene expression during cell reprogramming processes and contributes to the elaborate exploration of TRNs."
https://openalex.org/W2495529023,"In recent years, cytokine-mediated therapy has emerged as further advance alternative in cancer therapy. Interleukin-18 (IL-18) has exhibited interesting anti-cancer properties especially when combined with IL-12. We engineered IL-18 in order to improve its activity using single point mutagenesis. IL-18 mutants were constructed according to binding residues and polarity which we tried to increase polarity in M33Q and M60Q, enhanced cationicity in E6K, and flexibility in T63A. All IL-18 proteins were expressed in Pichia pastoris, purified, and then measured the activity by treating with the NK-92MI cell line to evaluate interferon-γ (IFN-γ) stimulation. The E6K and T63A mutant forms showed higher activity with respect to native proteins at the concentration of 200 ng mL-1 by inducing the expression of IFN-γ, about factors of 9 and 4, respectively. Meanwhile, M33Q and M60Q had no significant activity to induce IFN-γ. Interestingly, the combination of E6K and T63A mutations could synergize the induction activity of IL-18 to be 16 times at 200 ng mL-1. Furthermore, molecular dynamics studies have elucidated the effect due to mutation on conformation of the binding site of IL-18. The results turn out that E6K provides structural perseverance against mutation, while M33Q and M60Q promote vivid overall change in protein conformation, especially at the binding site. For T63A, mutation yields small difference in structure but clearly increases structural flexibility. However, a small structural change was observed when T63A was combined with E6K. Our research resulted in a novel version of IL-18 which could be a new key candidate for cytokine-mediated therapy."
