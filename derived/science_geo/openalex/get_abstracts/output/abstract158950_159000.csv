https://openalex.org/W80462140,"Apoptosis is stimulated by the insertion of Bax from the cytosol into mitochondrial membranes. The solution structure of Bax, including the putative transmembrane domain at the C terminus, was determined in order to understand the regulation of its subcellular location. Bax consists of 9 alpha helices where the assembly of helices alpha1 through alpha 8 resembles that of the apoptosis inhibitor, Bcl-x(L). The C-terminal alpha 9 helix occupies the hydrophobic pocket proposed previously to mediate heterodimer formation and bioactivity of opposing members of the Bcl-2 family. The Bax structure shows that the orientation of helix alpha 9 provides simultaneous control over its mitochondrial targeting and dimer formation."

The enhanceosome is assembled in the nucleosome-free enhancer region of the IFN-beta gene, leading to the modification and remodeling of a strategically positioned nucleosome that masks the TATA box and the start site of transcription. Initially, the GCN5 complex is recruited, which acetylates the nucleosome, and this is followed by recruitment of the CBP-PolII holoenzyme complex. Nucleosome acetylation in turn facilitates SWI/SNF recruitment by CBP, resulting in chromatin remodeling. This program of recruitment culminates in the binding of TFIID to the promoter and the activation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2164063328,"A broadly conserved membrane-associated protein required for the functional interaction of kinesin-I with axonal cargo was identified. Mutations in sunday driver (syd) and the axonal transport motor kinesin-I cause similar phenotypes in Drosophila, including aberrant accumulations of axonal cargoes. GFP-tagged mammalian SYD localizes to tubulovesicular structures that costain for kinesin-I and a marker of the secretory pathway. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis indicates that mouse SYD forms a complex with kinesin-I in vivo. Yeast two-hybrid analysis and in vitro interaction studies reveal that SYD directly binds kinesin-I via the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of kinesin light chain (KLC) with Kd ≅ 200 nM. We propose that SYD mediates the axonal transport of at least one class of vesicles by interacting directly with KLC."
https://openalex.org/W2088215231,"Type I collagen is composed of two chains, α1(I) and α2(I), encoded by two distinct genes, the α1(I) and α2(I) collagen genes, that are highly expressed in osteoblasts. In most physiological situations, α1(I) and α2(I) collagen expression is coregulated, suggesting that identical transcription factors control their expression. Here, we studied the role of Cbfa1, an osteoblast-specific transcription factor, in the control of α1(I) and α2(I) collagen expression in osteoblasts. A consensus Cbfa1-binding site, termed OSE2, is present at the same location in the α1(I) collagen promoter at approximately −1347 base pairs (bp) of the rat, mouse, and human genes. Cbfa1 can bind to this site, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and supershift experiments using an anti-Cbfa1 antibody. Mutagenesis of the α1(I) collagenOSE2 at −1347 bp reduced the activity of a α1(I) collagen promoter fragment 2- to 3-fold. Moreover, multimers of this OSE2 at −1347bp confer osteoblast-specific activity to a minimum α1(I) collagen promoter fragment in DNA transfection experiments as well as in transgenic mice. An additional Cbfa1-binding element is present in the α1(I) collagen promoter of mouse, rat, and human at approximately position −372. This site binds Cbfa1 only weakly and does not act as a cis-acting activator of transcription when tested in DNA transfection experiments. Similar to α1(I) collagen, the mouse α2(I) collagen gene contains multiple OSE2 sites, of which one is conserved across multiple species. In EMSA, Cbfa1 binds to this site and multimers of this α2(I) OSE2 element confer osteoblast-specific activity to the minimum α1(I) collagen promoter in DNA transfection experiments. Thus, our results suggest that Cbfa1 is one of the positive regulators of the osteoblast-specific expression of both type I collagengenes.

Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 155-166Google Scholar). It is a heterotrimer made of two α1(I) chains and one α2(I) chain (2van der Rest M. Garrone R. FASEB. J. 1991; 5: 2814-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The α1(I) and α2(I) chains are encoded by two distinct genes that are expressed most highly in two cell types: the fibroblast and the osteoblast. Moreover, the expression of these two genes is often regulated by identical transcription factors (3Maity S.N. Golumbek P.T. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B.

Thetype I collagen genes are expressed in osteoblastic cells at all stages during development and throughout life (8Sandberg M. Autio-Harmainen H. Vuorio E. Dev. Biol. 1988; 130: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), suggesting that the factor(s) controlling their expression in these cells could also control osteoblast differentiation and function. Another possibility, which is not exclusive of the previous one, is that different transcription factors may control their expression in osteoblasts at various stages of development and of postnatal life. Thus, the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms controlling α1(I)and α2(I) collagen gene expression in osteoblasts is of critical importance in understanding how osteoblast differentiation and, thereby, bone matrix deposition by differentiated osteoblasts is regulated. Ultimately, these studies may shed light on the pathogenesis of genetically acquired bone diseases and help design appropriate therapies for some of these diseases. The critical role that Cbfa1, a Runt-related osteoblast-specific transcription factor, plays in osteoblast differentiation and function has been demonstrated in mouse and in human using both molecular and genetic approaches (9Ducy P.

Cbfa1 was identified as a key regulator of osteoblast-specific gene expression through its binding to the OSE2 element of the mouse Osteocalcin genes 1 and 2 (OG1 and OG2) (9Ducy P. Zhang R.

The early and cell-specific expression of this gene together with its biological role in vivo as a factor required for osteoblast differentiation (9Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A. Karsenty G.

Cell. 1997; 89: 765-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar), indicate that Cbfa1 must control the expression of multiple target genes that are expressed earlier than Osteocalcin. Conceivably, these target genes could include the α1(I) and α2(I) collagengenes that are expressed early during development. This hypothesis was confirmed indirectly by the observation that expression of a dominant negative form of Cbfa1 in differentiated osteoblasts leads to a decrease in expression of the type I collagen genes in vivo (14Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). To date, no osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements to which Cbfa1 may bind have been identified in these genes. Two groups have extensively studied the regulation of expression of the α1(I) collagen gene in osteoblasts and have identified a region in the promoter of the rat and mouse α1(I) collagengene that plays an important role in this regulation of expression (15Bogdanovic Z. Bedalov A. Krebsbach P.H. Pavlin D. Woody C.O. Clark S.H. Thomas H.F. Rowe D.W. Kream B.E. Lichtler A.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,16Rossert J. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The sequence of this region bears no homology to a Cbfa1-binding site, and several homeobox-containing proteins can bind to this sequence and affect α1(I) collagen expression. However, a cell-specific transcription factor binding to this region has not yet been identified. Moreover, no osteoblast-specific cis-acting element has yet been identified in the α2(I) collagenpromoter. Given the large size of these genes and their expression at multiple stages of osteoblast differentiation, it is likely that several distinct osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements, besides those already described (15Bogdanovic Z. Bedalov A. Krebsbach P.H. Pavlin D. Woody C.O. Clark S.H. Thomas H.F. Rowe D.W. Kream B.E. Lichtler A.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 16Rossert J. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), contribute to the expression of the type I collagen genes in osteoblast progenitors and/or in fully differentiated osteoblasts. Consistent with this hypothesis, we noticed the existence of two Cbfa1-binding sites (OSE2s) in the mouse α1(I) collagen promoter and one OSE2 in the mouse α2(I) collagen gene that are conserved among multiple species. The functional importance of these sites has never been studied before. Here we present evidence suggesting that Cbfa1 is one of the factors controlling osteoblast-specific expression of bothtype I collagen genes. For DNA transfection and generation of transgenic mice, multimers of double-stranded oligonucleotides (see Table I) were cloned into the SmaI site upstream of a chimeric pK1-luc reporter plasmid containing the α1(I) collagen −86 minimal promoter (4Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9934-9942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) fused to a luciferase gene. The expression plasmid was pCMV-Osf2 (9Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A. Karsenty G.

Site-specific mutations were created in the intact promoter by using polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingson R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York,NY1995Google Scholar) on a construct containing 2.4 kb1 of the α1(I) collagen promoter upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. Sole presence of the desired mutations was verified by sequencing. COS7, NIH 3T3, HeLa, C2C12, and 10T1/2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). ROS 17/2.8 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium-F12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty hours before transfection, cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/dish and allowed to grow under normal culture conditions. For cotransfection experiments, we used 5 μg of Cbfa1 expression vector or empty vector, 5 μg of reporter plasmid or empty vector, and 2 μg of pSVβ-gal vector using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingson R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York,NY1995Google Scholar). Transfection conditions were identical to those used in the cotransfection experiments, except that 5 μg of reporter plasmid were used. Twenty hours following transfection, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in medium an additional 24 h. C2C12 cells were changed to media containing 10% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and allowed to incubate for 48 h. Cells were collected by scraping into 0.25 mTris-HCl, pH 7.8, and lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles. β-Galactosidase and luciferase assays were carried out as described previously (18Zhang R. Ducy P. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 110-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assay results were used to normalize the luciferase assay results for transfection efficiency. All DNA transfection experiments were repeated at least three times in triplicate. Nuclear extract from ROS 17/2.8 cells, primary osteoblasts, and other tissues were prepared as described previously (19Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) from 4-day-old wild-type mice and stored at −80 °C until use. Glutathione S-transferase-Cbfa1 was purified from transformed Escherichia coli bacteria using glutathione beads as described previously (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingson R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York,NY1995Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides (see Table I) were end-labeled and purified as previously described (19Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). 5 fmol of labeled oligonucleotide was incubated with 7 μg of ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract or 0.1 μg of recombinant Cbfa1 protein. α2(I) collagen EMSA experiments used twice the amount of extract or protein. The incubation mix for nuclear extract binding assays consisted of binding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin) (20Pepling M.E. Gergen J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9087-9091Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.5 fmol of single-stranded bottom strand oligonucleotide. Incubation took place at room temperature for 5 min. Supershift experiments were carried out as described above, except that the ROS17/2.8 nuclear extract was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with an antibody against Cbfa1 in binding buffer prior to their incubation with the labeled oligonucleotide for 10 min at room temperature. For recombinant protein binding assays, the incubation mix consisted of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmNaCl, 3 mm EGTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin. Incubation took place at room temperature for 5 min, followed by the addition of 1 μl of loading buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 0.025% bromphenol blue). The reactions were run on 5% polyacrylamide gel, 0.25× TBE (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for 90 min at 160 V. The gels were then dried and exposed to film at −80 °C. The plasmids described above containing multimers of the α1AB or α1mutAmutB oligonucleotides were digested, and the insert was purified by two rounds of agarose gel electrophoresis. Linear DNA inserts were injected into the pronuclei of fertilized B6D2F1 (Charles River Laboratory) mouse eggs, which were reimplanted in the oviduct of pseudo-pregnant CD1 foster mothers (Jackson Laboratories). Transgenic animals were identified by Southern blots of tail genomic DNA. The transgenic mice expressing the p4α1AB-luc construct were analyzed as follows: Organs from 4-week-old F1 animals were dissected and homogenized on ice in a buffer containing 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8) and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Protein homogenates were centrifuged, and supernatants were assayed for luciferase activity according to standard procedures (19Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Protein levels were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Relative luciferase activities were expressed as luciferase light units per 100 μg of protein expressed as a percentage of the activity in bone. DNA sequence inspection identified three potential OSE2 sites in the promoter of the murine α1(I) collagen gene. Two are located side-by-side at positions −1347 and −1338 in the mouse gene (Fig.1 A), and a third site is found at −372 in the mouse gene (Fig. 1 A). These potential OSE2 sites were termed α1A, α1B, and α1C, respectively (Fig.1 B). The presence of α1A and α1C, but not of α1B, at approximately the same location in the α1(I) collagen promoter sequences of rat and human (Fig. 1 A) suggested a biological role for these sites and led us to study these two regions. To determine whether Cbfa1 could bind to the OSE2-like sequences in the mouse α1(I) collagen promoter, we generated double-stranded oligonucleotides to be used in DNA binding assays (Table I). One of them, called α1AB, contains the α1A and α1B sites and their surrounding sequences. A second one, termed α1wtAmutB, contains the wild-type α1A site and a mutated α1B site. A third oligonucleotide, called α1mutAwtB, carries a mutated α1A sequence and a wild-type α1B sequence. A fourth oligonucleotide, α1mutAmutB, contains mutations in both the α1A and the α1B sites. Two other oligonucleotides, termed α1C and α1mutC, were generated to test the binding activity of the α1C site. The mutations introduced into all the oligonucleotides mentioned above have previously been shown to abolish binding of nuclear extract or recombinant Cbfa1 to the OSE2 sequence present in the Osteocalcin (OG2) promoter (OSE2OG2) (19Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). These double-stranded oligonucleotides were then used as probes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using either ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract or recombinant Cbfa1 as a source of protein. The complex formed upon incubation of ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract with α1AB migrated at the same location as the complex formed upon incubation of ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract with the OSE2OG2 oligonucleotide (Fig.2 A, lanes 1 and2), although it was of weaker intensity. In contrast, no protein-DNA complex was observed when using α1mutAmutB as a probe (Fig. 2A, lane 5). To determine which of the two upstream OSE2 sites was binding to this factor, we used α1wtAmutB oligonucleotide or α1mutAwtB oligonucleotide as probes in EMSA. Incubation of labeled α1wtAmutB with ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract generated a protein-DNA complex that had the same mobility as the one observed when using α1AB oligonucleotide as a probe and was of stronger intensity (Fig.2 A, lane 3). In contrast, when using α1mutAwtB oligonucleotide as a probe, we observed only a weak binding of ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract to the DNA (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). To determine whether this osteoblast-specific factor binding to the α1A OSE2-like element was indeed Cbfa1, we performed three types of experiments. First, we asked whether the factor present in ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract and binding to the α1A site was expressed only in osteoblasts. For that purpose, we prepared nuclear extract from primary osteoblasts and several other tissues and used them in EMSA. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the factor binding to the α1A oligonucleotide was present only in primary osteoblast nuclear extract and not in nuclear extract of other tissues. Next we performed supershift experiments using anti-Cbfa1 antibody or a nonspecific antiserum. Incubation of the nuclear extract with an antibody against Cbfa1 prior to addition of labeled α1AB oligonucleotide led to the formation of a second protein-DNA complex of slower mobility (Fig. 2 C,lane 2), whereas a nonspecific serum had no effect (Fig.2 C, lane 1), demonstrating that the protein-DNA complex formed upon incubation of the labeled α1AB with ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract contains Cbfa1, because this antibody is specific for Cbfa1 (14Ducy P. Starbuck M. Priemel M. Shen J. Pinero G. Geoffroy V. Amling M. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Third, we asked whether recombinant Cbfa1 could bind to α1AB but not to α1mutAmutB (Fig. 2 D, lanes 1and 4). Incubation of labeled α1wtAmutB oligonucleotide with recombinant Cbfa1 resulted in the formation of a protein-DNA complex (Fig. 2 D, lane 2), whereas incubations using labeled α1mutAwtB oligonucleotide did not (Fig. 2 D,lane 3). Taken together, these results indicate that the α1A site, a site conserved in multiple species, is the major binding site for Cbfa1 in this region of the α1(I) collagen promoter. We further addressed the functional relevance of the α1A and α1B sites using two additional approaches. First, to examine the effect of the α1A site on activity of a 2.4-kb promoter fragment, a site-specific mutation was generated in the α1A site via polymerase chain reaction and introduced into a 2.4-kb α1(I) collagenpromoter-luc chimeric gene. These 2-bp mutations resulted in a 54% decrease in promoter activity when tested in DNA transfection experiments in ROS17/2.8 cells (Fig.3 A). The same mutations did not reduce the activity of this 2.4-kb α1(I) collagen promoter-luc chimeric gene in other cell lines of nonosteoblastic nature of mesenchymal and nonmesenchymal origin (Fig. 3 A). This result further suggests that this cis-acting element is active only in osteoblasts. Mutations in the α1B site did not affect the activity of the 2.4-kb fragment of the α1(I) collagenpromoter used in this study (Fig. 3 A). Second, in DNA cotransfection assays performed in COS7 cells, a cell line that does not express Cbfa1 (21Kurikawa M. Tanaka T. Tanaka K. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16870-16876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), exogenous Cbfa1 transactivated a construct containing four copies of the α1AB oligonucleotide fused to a minimal α1(I) collagen promoter-luc chimeric gene, p4α1AB-luc (Fig.3 B). Indeed, cotransfection of p4α1AB-luc with a recombinant Cbfa1-expressing vector resulted in a 180-fold activation, whereas an empty expression vector had no effect. This level of transactivation is similar to what we observed when using a vector containing six copies of the OSE2OG2 as a reporter (Fig.3 B). The minimal α1(I) collagenpromoter fragment has virtually no transactivation ability on its own (4Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9934-9942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When using a vector containing multimers of α1wtAmutB oligonucleotides cloned upstream of the minimalα1(I) collagen promoter fragment, we observed a 120-fold increase in luciferase activity, indicating that the α1A site is the main contributor to the transactivating function of this region of the α1(I) collagen promoter. This is consistent with the observation that only the α1A site is able to bind Cbfa1 in vitro. The slight decrease in activity seen with the loss of the α1B site may indicate a synergistic effect of these two sites in this type of experiment. The activity of constructs containing four copies of α1mutAmutB, or of α1mutAwtB upstream of the minimal α1(I) collagen promoter-luc chimeric gene (Fig. 3 B) could not be increased upon cotransfection with the Cbfa1-expressing vector, thus demonstrating the specificity of the effect observed. In this set of experiments, we used multimers of the α1(I) collagen OSE2 sites, because Cbfa1 does not transactivate the α1(I) collagen promoter fragment in this type of assay. This is a consistent feature of Cbfa1 biology, indeed, we observed weak transactivation of the OG2 promoter when cotransfected with Cbfa1 (9Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3630) Google Scholar), compared with the strong transactivating effect of Cbfa1 observed when using 6OSE2-luc (9Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3630) Google Scholar). Third, we asked whether these OSE2 sites could confer bone-specific expression to a reporter gene in vivo. For that purpose, we generated transgenic mice containing two of the constructs used in the above transfections, p4α1AB-luc and p4α1mutAmutB-luc. In transgenic mice harboring p4α1AB-luc, luciferase activity could be detected in bone but neither in other tissues expressing type I collagen, nor in tissues which do not express type I collagen (Fig. 3 C). As expected, given their respective sizes, the expression of p4α1AB-luc was considerably lower than that of α1(I) collagen (data not shown). The p4α1mutAmutB-luc construct was not expressed in bone or any other tissue (Fig.3 C). Taken together with the results of the mutagenesis of the α1A site and of the α1B site, these results indicate that Cbfa1 contributes to the expression of α1(I) collagenin osteoblasts through the α1A site. As mentioned at the beginning of “Results,” there is a third OSE2 sequence in theα1(I) collagen promoter, located at −372bp in mouse (site α1C, Fig. 1 A). This site is also conserved across species, and we first asked whether this OSE2-like sequence could be bound by Cbfa1 in EMSA. Labeled α1C oligonucleotides were incubated with ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract as described above, leading to the formation of a protein-DNA complex that migrated at the same location as that formed upon incubation of ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract with labeled OSE2OG2 (Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and3). However, the protein-DNA complex was of weak intensity compared with that we observed when using OG2OG2 or even α1wtAmutB oligonucleotides as probes (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and 2). No complex of this size was observed after incubation of labeled α1mutC with ROS 17/2.8 extract (Fig.4 A, lane 3). To show that Cbfa1 was part of this protein-DNA complex, supershift experiments were performed using an anti-Cbfa1 antibody, a labeled α1C oligonucleotide, and ROS17/2.8 nuclear extract as a source of protein. The incubation of ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract with an antibody against Cbfa1 prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotide led to the formation of a slower mobility complex. This complex was specific, because it was not observed when using a nonspecific antiserum (Fig.4 A, lanes 5 and 6). EMSA experiments using recombinant Cbfa1 provided further evidence that this site could bind, albeit weakly, Cbfa1, because Cbfa1 was able to bind to α1C oligonucleotide but not to α1mutC oligonucleotide (Fig.4 B, lanes 1 and 2). These results indicate that Cbfa1 is able to bind only weakly to the α1C site in the mouse α1(I) collagen promoter, suggesting that this OSE2 site may not play a critical role. To test this hypothesis, we cloned four copies of wild-type or mutated α1C oligonucleotides upstream of the minimal α1(I) collagen promoter fragment-luciferase chimeric gene used in Fig.3 A. As seen in Fig. 4 C, in DNA transfection experiments in COS7 cells, neither wild-type nor mutant α1C constructs could increase the activity of this reporter gene upon cotransfection with a Cbfa1 expression vector. This lack of an overt role for the α1C site is consistent with the rather poor binding of Cbfa1 to this site. Taken together, these results indicate that the α1C site is not a critical cis-acting element in controlling the osteoblast-specific expression of the mouseα1(I) collagen gene. Because α1(I) andα2(I) collagen genes are often coregulated, we next asked whether Cbfa1 was also regulating the expression ofα2(I) collagen. Sequence analysis of theα2(I) collagen promoter uncovered the existence of several potential OSE2 sites. Only one of these, located in the first exon of the gene, is present at the same location in theα2(I) collagen gene of multiple vertebrate species (Fig. 1 C). For this reason, this site was studied further. First, DNA binding was studied. EMSA was performed using a labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the OSE2 element (α2A) as a probe and ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract as a source of protein. Incubation of labeled α2A oligonucleotide with ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract resulted in the generation of a protein-DNA complex migrating at the same location as the protein-DNA complex formed upon incubation of ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract with labeled OSE2OG2 and α1wtAmutB (Fig.5 A, lanes 1 and2). This protein-DNA complex was specific, because it did not form upon incubation of ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract with an oligonucleotide containing a mutation in this OSE2 sequence (α2mutA) (Fig. 5 A, lane 3). Because the binding of nuclear extract to α2A oligonucleotide was weak, despite using a 2-fold higher amount of ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract, we also used recombinant Cbfa1 protein in EMSA. The incubation of recombinant Cbfa1 with α2A oligonucleotide, again using a 2-fold higher amount of Cbfa1 compared with that used to see binding of Cbfa1 to α1wtAmutB, resulted in the formation of a protein-DNA complex (Fig. 5 B, lane 1). This complex did not form upon incubation of Cbfa1 with α2mutA oligonucleotide (Fig. 5 B, lane 2). These data show that the conserved OSE2 sequence present in theα2(I) collagen gene can bind Cbfa1, albeit more weakly than the α1A site. To study the function of the α2A site, cotransfection assays were performed in COS7 cells. In this assay, exogenous Cbfa1 transactivated a construct containing a multimer of four α2A oligonucleotides fused to a minimal α1(I) collagen promoter-luc chimeric gene, p4α2A-luc (Fig. 5 C), producing an ∼15-fold increase in luciferase activity. This effect was specific, because the construct containing a multimer of six α2mutA oligonucleotides (Fig. 5 C) produced no activity. The relatively weak increase in luciferase activity compared with the effect observed with multimers of the α1wtAmutB oligonucleotide is consistent with the weaker binding of Cbfa1 to the α2A sequence. Taken together, our data provide evidence indicating that Cbfa1 is one of the transcription factors contributing to the expression of the two Type I collagen genes in osteoblasts in vivo. Moreover, along with CBF (3Maity S.N. Golumbek P.T. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. Science. 1988; 241: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 4Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol.

The finding that Cbfa1 favors type I collagen expression in osteoblasts is consistent with the absence of bone extracellular matrix in Cbfa1-deficient mice and with the marked decrease of Type I collagen expression in transgenic mice overexpressing a dominant negative form of Cbfa1 in osteoblasts (10Komori T.

Amling M. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). These results broaden the spectrum of transcription factors able to regulate type I collagen gene expression at various stages of osteoblast differentiation and overall increase our understanding of type I collagen genes' regulation. The data presented here indicate that there is a clear functional hierarchy between the different Cbfa1-binding sites, or OSE2 sites, present in the α1(I) collagen promoter. Clearly, the α1A element is the most potent activator of expression of all the OSE2 elements we studied in this promoter. These findings do not exclude the possibility that OSE2 sites present further upstream in the promoter and/or elsewhere in the gene may also contribute to the osteoblast-specific expression of the α1(I) collagen gene. Conceivably, one of these as of yet uncharacterized OSE2 sites may bind Cbfa1 with a higher affinity and act as a more powerful osteoblast-specific cis-acting element. We did not identify any conserved consensus OSE2 sites by examining the DNA sequence of the region located between −1540 and −1656 that has been previously shown to be required for osteoblast expression (25Rossert J.A. Chen S.S. Eberspaecher H. Smith C.N. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Aci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1027-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This reinforces the hypothesis that other cell-specific transcription factors must contribute to osteoblastic expression of the type I collagen genes. Although Cbfa1 can bind to a site present in theα2(I) collagen gene and the expression of this gene is decreased in transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative form of Cbfa1, the level of activation observed in cotransfection experiments with the α2A construct was lower than that seen when using the α1AB constructs based on the α1(I) collagen promoter. At least two explanations could account for this observation. First, and most importantly, the binding of ROS 17/2.8 nuclear extract to the α2A site was weaker than its binding to the α1A site of α1(I) collagen, indicating that this site has a lower affinity to Cbfa1. Second, considering the numerous OSE2 sites present in the α2(I) collagen promoter, it is likely that, for this gene and for theα1(I) collagen gene as well, some of the other OSE2 sites act alone or in concert with the conserved OSE2 site to control its expression in osteoblasts in vivo. If Cbfa1 is one positive regulator of type I collagenexpression in osteoblasts, it is clear from the above data that it is not the only one. Indeed, Cbfa1 expression is initiated in osteoblast progenitors after type I collagen expression can be noticed in mesenchymal cells. Moreover, at least one othercis-acting element has been shown to be implicated in osteoblast-specific expression of the α1(I) collagen gene in mouse and rat (15Bogdanovic Z. Bedalov A. Krebsbach P.H.

Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Members of the DLX family of homeobox proteins are able to bind to this sequence and to activate transcription (22Tadic T. Dodig M. Kronenberg M.S. Kaliterna M. Kosher R.A. Ferrari D.A. Lichtler A.C. Bone. 1998; 23: S539Google Scholar). Another homeobox-related protein, MSX2, can bind to this sequence and repress expression of the α1(I) collagen gene (23Dodig M. Kronenberg M.S. Bedalov A. Kream B.E Gronowicz G. Clark S.H. Mack K. Liu Y. Maxon R. Pan Z.Z. Upholt W.B. Rowe D.W. Lichtler A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16422-16429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and recent genetic evidence has demonstrated that MSX2 is upstream of Cbfa1 (24Satokata I. Ma L. Ohshima H. Bei M. Woo I. Nishizawa K. Maeda T. Yoshiro T. Uchiyama M. Heany S. Peters H. Tang Z. Maxson R. Maas R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). These homeobox proteins are likely to be expressed earlier than Cbfa1 and may even control its expression, directly or indirectly. It is tempting to speculate that these homeobox proteins, possibly with other regulatory proteins, act early during the specification of mesenchymal progenitor cells to the osteoblast lineage and that Cbfa1 is required for osteoblast differentiation and for the maintenance of the osteoblast phenotype. This hypothesis will be more easily testable when mice deficient for several DLX proteins are available. Regardless, the observation that Cbfa1 binds to and regulates the activity of both type I collagen genes in osteoblasts further illustrates how important Cbfa1 is in osteoblast physiology.

The cargo vesicles of KIF13A contained AP-1 and mannnose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR). Overexpression of KIF13A resulted in mislocalization of the AP-1 and the M6PR. Functional blockade of KIF13A reduced cell surface expression of the M6PR. Thus, KIF13A transports M6PR-containing vesicles and targets the M6PR from TGN to the plasma membrane via direct interaction with the AP-1 adaptor complex."

For ligand purification assays, 5 μg of SP1999/pCDNA3.1 and a mixture of chimeric G proteins (0.5 μg for each chimera) were cotransfected in CHO-DHFR− cells in a 75-cm2 flask. As a negative control, the same amount of empty pCDNA3.1 plasmid and the chimeric G protein mixture were cotransfected into CHO-DHFR− cells. For pharmacological studies, CHO-DHFR− or NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with SP1999 were used in addition to transiently transfected cells as indicated. The transiently transfected cells or stable cell lines were seeded into 96-well plates (black well, clear bottom) and incubated in a tissue culture incubator at 37 °C overnight. The growth medium was then aspirated and replaced with 100 μl of loading medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm Fluo-3-AM plus 10% pluronic acid, and 2.5 mm probenecid) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were subsequently washed three times with Hank's balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mmprobenecid, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin using a Denley cell washer (Denley Instruments). 100 μl of wash buffer was left in each well. The washed cells were placed in a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR), and changes in cellular fluorescence were recorded after the addition of 50-μl tissue extract fractions or testing compounds diluted in wash buffer. Rat spinal cords (100 g) from Pel-Freez were added to 1000 ml of boiling water with a protease inhibitor mixture (from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The tissue was boiled for 5 min, homogenized by blender for 5 min, and then re-boiled for 15 min. Finally acetic acid was added to a final concentration of 0.5 m and allowed to incubate at 4 °C overnight with constant stirring. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was lyophilized. The lyophilized sample was dissolved in 30 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter before loading onto a reverse phase C18 column (Vydac C18, 218TP510). Elution was at 5 ml/min with 1.5 column volume (CV) of buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O) followed by a linear gradient of buffer A to buffer B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile) during a period of 6 CV. Fractions (5 ml) were collected and lyophilized, then dissolved in 1 ml of buffer A. 25 μl was used for screening by FLIPR assay in transiently transfected CHO-DHFR− cells. Two active peaks were identified in fractions 19–23 and 30–35 and pooled together. The two peaks were later shown to be identical (data not shown). The pool of fractions 30–35 was loaded onto a cation exchange column (SP8HR, Waters) pre-equilibrated with buffer C (20 mmNa3PO4, pH = 6.4). Elution was at 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of buffer C and 50% buffer D (20 mmNa3PO4, 1 m NaCl, pH = 6.4) in 7.6 CV. 1.3-ml fractions were collected and screened by FLIPR assay in CHO-DHFR− cells. Activity was identified in flow-through fractions 5–12 and pooled. The pool was then loaded onto a pre-equilibrated Mono Q column (10/10, Waters), and eluted at 2 ml/min with a linear gradient of buffer C to 50% of buffer D in 7 CV, followed by 50% of buffer D for additional 5 min. The activity was identified in fractions 49–52 (1.3 ml/fraction) and pooled. The pool was then diluted with water to reduce the salt concentration and loaded onto DEAE column (5 × 100, Waters). Elution was at 0.5 ml/min with a linear gradient of buffer C to 50% buffer D over a period of 8 CV. Activity was identified in fractions 37–43 (0.5 ml/fraction) and pooled. The pool was then adjusted to 0.6% trifluoroacetic acid and then loaded onto a C18 column (Vydac 218TP510). Elution was at 3 ml/min with a linear gradient of buffer A to 20% buffer B over a period of 4 CV. The active fractions were identified in fractions 14–17 (1.3 ml/fraction) and pooled. The pool was then concentrated to 80 μl and loaded onto a Superdex HR10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. Elution was at 0.5 ml/min with buffer A. The activity was located in fractions 33–36 (0.5 ml/fraction). Fractions 33–36 were then subjected to structural analysis. Negative ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry coupled with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was applied to analyze the ligand of SP1999. Reverse phase HPLC was carried out on an Alliance 2690 HPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA). The sample was loaded onto a Jupiter C18 column (2.1 mm (inner diameter) × 50 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å) and eluted with an isocratic gradient of acetonitrile with 0.1% ammonium hydroxide. The entire column effluent (0.15 ml/min) was delivered to the mass spectrometer without flow split. The mass spectra were recorded on a Micromass Quattro LC triple quadruple mass spectrometer (Manchester, United Kingdom), which was operated under unit mass resolution conditions across the mass range of interest. Full-scan mass spectra coveringm/z of 100–1000 were acquired with a scan time of 1.75 s. To confirm the structural information, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry experiments were also performed on selected ions. The 30-eV collision energy was applied for the fragmentation study with the collision gas cell pressure at 3 × 10−4 millibars (argon). CHO-DHFR− cells stably transfected with SP1999 were used for cAMP assay. The stable SP1999 cell line and wild type cells were first grown in 12-well plates to 70–80% confluence. The cells were then incubated for 2 h with 200 μl of medium containing 5 μCi/ml [3H]adenine. Subsequently 50 μl of HEPES (250 mm, pH 7.5) containing 50 μm forskolin, 200 μmisobutylmethylxanthine, and the substance to be tested was added to the cells and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Incubations were terminated by addition of 0.8 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid (cold). [3H]cAMP was purified using Dowex and alumina chromatography and counted by scintillation counter as described previously (13Harden T.K. Scheer A.G. Smith M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 21: 570-580PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA of SP1999 was first cloned by Human Genome Science Corp. and disclosed in patent WO 98/50549 (Fig.1 A). It contains an 1029-base open reading frame encoding 343 amino acid residues. There is an in-frame stop codon in the 5′-untranslated region upstream of the ATG initiation codon. The hydrophilicity profile of the deduced peptide sequences revealed the presence of seven hydrophobic regions, consistent with a seven-transmembrane structure typical of G protein-coupled receptors (14Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 15Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). The seven transmembrane domains areunderlined in Fig. 1 A. Phylogenetic analysis shows that SP1999 shares homology with a group of orphan G protein-coupled receptors (Fig. 1 B). Its closest known receptors are UDP-glucose and platelet activating factor receptors (8Chao W. Olson M.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 9Chambers J.K. Macdonald L.E. Sarau H.M. Ames R.S. Freeman K. Foley J.J. Zhu Y. McLaughlin M.M. Murdock P. McMillan L. Trill J. Swift A. Aiyar N. Taylor P. Vawter L. Naheed S. Szekeres P. Hervieu G. Scott C. Watson J.M. Murphy A.J. Duzic E. Klein C. Bergsma D.J. Wilson S. Livi G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10767-10771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Notably, SP1999 shares relatively little homology with known P2Y receptors (2Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the distribution of SP1999 expression in human tissues, radiolabeled DNA probes from SP1999 were hybridized to multiple tissue mRNA dot blots (RNA Master Blot, CLONTECH) as shown in Fig.2 A. The RNA Master blot contains a variety of human tissues including different regions of brain, heart, spleen, lung, etc. As shown in Fig. 2 A, hybridization of the SP1999 probe showed very strong signals in all brain regions and spinal cord as well as in fetal brain. The most intense signals were from substantia nigra, putamen, thalamus, and temporal cortex. In addition, weak signals can be observed in the lung, appendix, pituitary, and adrenal gland. The brain distribution of SP1999 was further demonstrated by Northern blot of mRNA from multiple regions of human brain (Fig. 2 B). The Northern blot showed a predominant 3.2-kilobase band across all brain regions with a minor 2.4-kilobase band in some brain regions such as cortex and medulla. To detect the expression of SP1999 in human blood platelets, RT-PCR experiments were performed (Fig. 2 C). A specific 140-base pair product for SP1999 was amplified in cDNA from human platelets but not in the cDNA from the human platelets without reverse transcriptase and from human leukocyte, indicating that SP1999 is expressed in human blood platelets. β2-Integrin was used as a negative control here to exclude the possibility of contaminating of human platelets by leukocytes, whereas CD2 and GHPDH were used as positive control. Therefore, SP1999 is expressed in human brain, spinal cord, and human blood platelets. To understand the function of SP1999, we set out to identify its endogenous ligand; SP1999 was cotransfected with a mixture of chimeric G protein plasmids encoding Gαq/12, Gα16, Gαq/i, Gαq/z, Gαq/i3, Gαq/s, GαqΔ5, and Gαq/o to CHO-DHFR−, whereas empty pCDNA-3.1 was cotransfected with chimeric G protein mixture as negative control. Each G protein chimera used here is a Gαq subunit with its five C-terminal residues substituted by the corresponding residues of other Gα subunits such as Gαi except that, for GαqΔ5, its five C-terminal residues was deleted (10Saito Y. Nothacker H.P. Wang Z. Lin S.H. Leslie F. Civelli O. Nature. 1999; 400: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 11Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). As SP1999 was predominantly expressed in brain tissue and spinal cord, spinal cord was used as raw material for purification. Rat spinal cords (100 g) were extracted according to “Experimental Procedures,” loaded onto a C18 column (Vydac C18, 218TP510), and gradient elution was performed. The chromatogram is shown in Fig.3 A. Each fraction was screened for Ca2+ mobilization using CHO-DHFR− cells transfected with SP1999 and the chimeric G proteins using the FLIPR assay. Using different dilutions of the fractions, it was possible to identify regions exhibiting activity only in the SP1999-transfected cells (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, this SP1999 specific activity required the coexpression of chimeric G proteins. Two peaks (fractions 19–23 and fractions 30–35) were identified that activated SP1999 specifically. These two peaks were later shown to be identical (data not shown). Subsequent experiments using chimeric G proteins transfected individually with SP1999 indicated that the Gαq/i3 chimera provided the most robust response (data not shown). The pool of fractions 30–35 was subsequently purified further by cation-exchange (SP8HR), anion exchange (Mono Q), anion exchange (DEAE), reverse phase (C18 column), and size exclusion (Superdex HR10/30). Fig. 3 B shows the chromatogram of the final size exclusion column. The purified sample (peak A) was first characterized by determination of its UV spectrum and by its sensitivity to protease digestion and phosphatase digestion. The purified substance was found to have the following properties. First, it binds to an anion exchange column, indicating it has negative charges; second, it has an absorption peak at 258 nm; finally, it cannot be inactivated by protease K digestion but can be inactivated by nucleotide phosphatase digestion (data not shown). These results suggest that the purified substance is a small molecule and is likely to be a nucleotide. The purified substance was then subjected to mass spectrum analysis in negative ion mode. Three major peaks at 227.0, 249.0, and 426.1 m/z were detected (Fig. 3 C). As the data were acquired in negative ion mode, the molecular weight of the substance analyzed should be 1 Da larger than that shown in the spectrum. Further fragmentation of the ions suggest that the ion atm/z 426.1 is consistent with the structure of 5′-ADP, the ion at m/z 227.0 is a dimer of trifluoroacetic acid (trifluoroacetic acid, formula weight = 114), and them/z 249.0 peak is an adduct of the trifluoroacetic acid dimer and a sodium ion. Since the sample was purified by reverse phase HPLC in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid, it is not surprising to observe the adduct peaks at m/z 270.0 and 249.0 peaks. Trifluoroacetic acid has been shown to be inactive at SP1999 (data not shown); thus, 5′-ADP appears to be the active component in the sample. When commercially available 5′-ADP was compared with the purified sample, the activities were shown to be identical. Using the CHO cells cotransfected with SP1999 and chimeric Gαq/i3, the dose response to ADP was examined, and an EC50 of 330 nm was observed (Fig.4 A). However, ADP also caused significant Ca2+ mobilization in pCDNA and Gαq/i3-transfected CHO cells, with an EC50 of 14 μm (Fig. 4 A). The same Ca2+mobilization response was also observed in untransfected, wild type CHO cells (data not shown). To avoid the Ca2+ response to ADP inherent in the CHO cells, the activity of ADP was tested on several cell lines. It was found that NIH3T3 cells were devoid of endogenous ADP responses in the FLIPR assay. However, when transiently transfected with SP1999 and chimeric Gαq/i3, ADP potently stimulated Ca2+ mobilization with an EC50 of 74 nm (Fig. 4 B). The discrepancy in the EC50 values for ADP in the two cell lines is likely due to the addition of the endogenous ADP response observed in the CHO cells.Figure 4ADP dose response. Dose-response curves are from a representative experiment. A, ADP dose response in CHO-DHFR− cells. SP1999 or the vector pCDNA3.1 was cotransfected with chimeric Gαq/i3 into CHO-DHFR−, and Ca2+ mobilization of transfected cells in response to increasing doses of ADP was measured by FLIPR. B, ADP dose response in NIH3T3 cells. SP1999 or the vector pCDNA3.1 was cotransfected with or without chimeric Gαq/i3 into NIH3T3 cells, and ADP dose response was measured as described.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the G protein coupling specificity of SP1999, single chimeric G proteins were cotransfected with SP1999 into NIH3T3 cells, and the response to 300 nm ADP was then measured by FLIPR. As shown in Fig.5 A, strong Ca2+flux signals were observed for cells transfected with SP1999 and Gαq/i, Gαq/i3, or Gαq/o, while much weaker signals were observed for cells transfected with SP1999 and all other chimeric G proteins. These results suggest that SP1999 should normally couple to Gα proteins of the Gαi/o class (10Saito Y. Nothacker H.P. Wang Z. Lin S.H. Leslie F. Civelli O. Nature. 1999; 400: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 11Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The coupling between SP1999 and the Gαi/o proteins also suggests that ADP should act to inhibit the activity of adenylyl cyclase in SP1999-transfected cells (11Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 15Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). To confirm this prediction, a cAMP assay was performed using CHO-DHFR−cells stably transfected with SP1999. To measure cAMP, the cells were first labeled with [3H]adenine, then the [3H]cAMP generated after ADP stimulation was purified by column chromatography and quantitated by scintillation spectrometry (13Harden T.K. Scheer A.G. Smith M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 21: 570-580PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 B, ADP caused a dose-dependent decrease in forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in SP1999-transfected cells, but had no effect on nontransfected cells. The EC50 of this response was 60.7 nm. The pharmacological profile of SP1999 was further characterized in both the FLIPR assay and the cAMP assay. Using SP1999- and Gαq/i3-cotransfected NIH3T3 cells, a variety of nucleotides were screened by FLIPR assay. Fig.6 shows the dose-response curves for ADP, ADPβS, 2-MeS-ADP, and 2-MeS-ATP for SP1999 in this assay. TableI lists the EC50 values for all the compounds tested at SP1999. The rank order of potency is 2-MeS-ATP = 2-MeS-ADP > ADP=ADPβS > 2-Cl-ATP > ATPγS. Table II lists the nucleotides that were not active at SP1999 at concentrations up to 8 μm or 1 mm. The nucleotides ATP, UTP, ITP, and Ap4A exhibited activity in wild-type NIH3T3 cells, and with EC50 value of about 15 μm. The ability of the compounds active at SP1999 to inhibit cAMP in SP1999-transfected CHO cells was also examined. With the exception of ATPγS, the rank order of EC50 values is comparable to those determined using the FLIPR assay. Three compounds were also identified that were able to antagonize the activity of ADP at SP1999: reactive blue-2, suramin, and 2′,5′-ADP. The K i for reactive blue-2, suramin, and 2′,5′-ADP in the presence of 200 nm ADP were 1.3, 3.6, and 10 μm, respectively. Reactive blue-2 and suramin have been shown to be nonselective antagonists for P2Y receptors (2Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar).Table IPotency of SP1999 LigandsCompoundEC50 by FLIPR assayEC50 by cAMP assaynmnmADP74 ± 1060.7 ± 10ADPβS89 ± 15191 ± 202-MeS-ADP2.3 ± 0.314.1 ± 22-MeS-ATP3.4 ± 0.33.4 ± 0.52-Cl-ATP470 ± 100636 ± 100ATPγS1200 ± 200110 ± 100The FLIPR assays were performed using SP1999- and Gαq/i3-cotransfected NIH3T3 cells, and cAMP assays were performed using SP1999 stably transfected CHO-DHFR− cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The dose response of each compound was fitted by Prism software, and the EC50 value was obtained.

The values represent mean ± S.D. withn = 3. The results of the present study clearly indicate that SP1999 is a high affinity receptor for ADP, despite the fact that SP1999 does not possess a particularly high degree of homology with the known purinergic receptors. It is unlikely that the results presented here are due to the unsuspected expression of a known purinergic receptor, since the profile of activity observed exhibits several properties that distinguish it from the previously cloned P2 purinergic receptors. Notably, the responses presented exhibit a unique pharmacological and second messenger profile and are only observed in conjunction with expression of transfected SP1999. Although the previously cloned P2 receptors are all capable of coupling through Gαq to activation of phospholipase C and Ca2+ mobilization, SP1999 couples only to the Gαi class of G proteins to inhibit adenylyl-cyclase activity. In NIH3T3 cells, Ca2+mobilization in response to ADP is only observed when the cells are transfected with both SP1999 and a chimeric G protein of the Gαq/i,o class (Gαq/i,i3, or o). Pharmacologically, SP1999 differs from the P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, and P2Y11 receptors in that ADP is the most potent of the naturally occurring nucleotides examined, whereas the most potent nucleotides for P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, and P2Y11 receptors are ATP, UTP, or UDP (2Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). Although ADP is also the most potent of the naturally occurring nucleotides at the P2Y1 receptor, P2Y1 couples to Gαq while SP1999 couples to Gαi. Although we currently cannot rule out an interaction of ATP, UTP, ITP, or Ap4A at SP1999 (UDP was found to be inactive), these interactions must be of low affinity (EC50 > 10 μm) as their background EC50 values in NIH3T3 cells are larger than 10 μm. Despite the overall low sequence homology with the known nucleotide receptors, SP1999 does contain several amino acid residues that are conserved in the P2Y family, and which have previously been implicated in nucleotide binding. Amino acids Phe-105, Tyr-106, Tyr-110, Phe-198, His-253, Arg-256, and Ser-288 are identical to residues highly conserved among the P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, and P2Y6 receptors (16Jiang Q. Guo D. Lee B.X. Van Rhee A.M. Kim Y.C. Nicholas R.A. Schachter J.B. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Hoffmann C. Moro S. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14639-14647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Through the use of molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, these residues have been shown to be involved in the binding of purinergic ligands to the P2Y1 receptor. Although several residues found to be absolutely required for ligand interaction at the P2Y1 receptor (Arg-128 and Arg-310 in P2Y1) are not strictly conserved in SP1999, it is highly possible that ligands bind to SP1999 in an orientation different from P2Y1, allowing other residues present in SP1999 to become involved in the binding site (16Jiang Q. Guo D. Lee B.X. Van Rhee A.M. Kim Y.C. Nicholas R.A. Schachter J.B. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Hoffmann C. Moro S.

Further studies involving molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis of SP1999 will be required to specifically define the ligand binding pocket of this receptor. Nevertheless, the conserved nature of the residues mentioned above supports the finding that ADP can act as a ligand at this receptor. ADP receptors have been identified in both C6 glioma cell lines and blood platelets but have not been cloned (5Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Ashby B. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2024-2029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 6Boyer J.L. Lazarowski E.R. Chen X.H. Harden T.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 267: 1140-1146PubMed Google Scholar). In rat C6 glioma cells, an ADP receptor has been described to couple to Gαi. The order of its agonist potency was 2-MeSATP > = 2-MeS-ADP > ADPβS > 2-Cl-ATP = ADP = ATPγS > ATP > UTP (6Boyer J.L. Lazarowski E.R. Chen X.H. Harden T.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 267: 1140-1146PubMed Google Scholar), which was very similar to that of SP1999. There are also two different G protein-coupled ADP receptors identified in blood platelets. One ADP receptor, P2TAC, couples to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase; another ADP receptor, P2Y1, couples to mobilization of intracellular calcium stores through inositol phosphate production (5Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Ashby B. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2024-2029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Since SP1999 couples to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and the pharmacological profiles between SP1999 and P2TAC are also very similar and, moreover, SP1999 mRNA was found in platelets, SP1999 may also be a candidate for the uncloned P2TAC receptors. However, to confirm whether SP1999 is the ADP receptor identified in C6 cells or blood platelets, further experiments must be done.

https://openalex.org/W2122117766,"We analyzed the ability of a diverse set of mammalian secreted phospholipase A2(sPLA2) to release arachidonate for lipid mediator generation in two transfected cell lines. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, the heparin-binding enzymes sPLA2-IIA, -IID, and -V promote stimulus-dependent arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin E2 production in a manner dependent on the heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican. In contrast, sPLA2-IB, -IIC, and -IIE, which bind weakly or not at all to heparanoids, fail to elicit arachidonate release, and addition of a heparin binding site to sPLA2-IIC allows it to release arachidonate. Heparin nonbinding sPLA2-X liberates arachidonic acid most likely from the phosphatidylcholine-rich outer plasma membrane in a glypican-independent manner. In rat mastocytoma RBL-2H3 cells that lack glypican, sPLA2-V and -X, which are unique among sPLA2s in being able to hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine-rich membranes, act most likely on the extracellular face of the plasma membrane to markedly augment IgE-dependent immediate production of leukotriene C4 and platelet-activating factor. sPLA2-IB, -IIA, -IIC, -IID, and -IIE exert minimal effects in RBL-2H3 cells. These results are also supported by studies with sPLA2mutants and immunocytostaining and reveal that sPLA2-dependent lipid mediator generation occur by distinct (heparanoid-dependent and -independent) mechanisms in HEK293 and RBL-2H3 cells. We analyzed the ability of a diverse set of mammalian secreted phospholipase A2(sPLA2) to release arachidonate for lipid mediator generation in two transfected cell lines. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, the heparin-binding enzymes sPLA2-IIA, -IID, and -V promote stimulus-dependent arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin E2 production in a manner dependent on the heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican. In contrast, sPLA2-IB, -IIC, and -IIE, which bind weakly or not at all to heparanoids, fail to elicit arachidonate release, and addition of a heparin binding site to sPLA2-IIC allows it to release arachidonate.

Group IID (sPLA2-IID) and IIE (sPLA2-IIE) sPLA2s are structurally most related to sPLA2-IIA, and the genes for these three isozymes as well as those for group IIC, IIF, and V sPLA2s map to the same chromosome locus (4Tischfield J.A.

Compared with other group II sPLA2s, group IIF sPLA2 has a relatively long, proline-rich C-terminal extension containing a single cysteine residue and is acidic (8Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H.

Because the sPLA2 family is diverse and the tissue distribution of each enzyme is unique, these enzymes are likely to have distinct physiological functions. In an effort to clarify the role of sPLA2s in the regulation of arachidonic acid (AA) release from membrane phospholipids, we have found that sustained expression of sPLA2-IIA or sPLA2-V by forcible gene transfer or by de novo induction following cytokine stimulation leads to efficient stimulus-dependent but not spontaneous AA release (24Kuwata H.

In such cells, endogenously produced sPLA2-IIA is captured by the heparan sulfate chains of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteoglycan glypican and is transferred to punctate and perinuclear compartments that colocalize with caveolin (39Murakami M.

Such compartmentalization may allow sPLA2-IIA to become in contact with its suitable substrates and to be more efficiently coupled to downstream AA-metabolizing enzymes. On the other hand, mammalian cells are generally highly resistant to exogenous sPLA2-IIA, with very high concentrations (greater than or equal to 10 μg/ml) usually being required to elicit AA release (41Murakami M.

To better understand the regulatory functions of sPLA2s in lipid mediator biosynthesis, we have extended our gain-of-function studies by transfecting human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and rat mastocytoma RBL-2H3 cells with a variety of sPLA2s. Studies using sPLA2 mutants with altered heparanoid and interfacial binding properties provide additional data that help us to formulate models for the mechanisms of action of sPLA2s in these mammalian cells. Moreover, using RBL-2H3 cells, we have demonstrated, for the first time, the functional coupling between specific sPLA2s and the leukotriene (LT) and platelet-activating factor (PAF) biosynthetic pathways.

To further investigate the effects of IFN-γ on fat cells, we examined the effects of this cytokine on the expression of adipocyte transcription factors in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Although IFN-γ regulated the expression of several adipocyte transcription factors, IFN-γ treatment resulted in a rapid reduction of both peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) protein and mRNA. A 48-h exposure to IFN-γ also resulted in a decrease of both CCAAT/enhancer-binding α and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP-1) expression. The short half-life of both the PPARγ mRNA and protein likely contributed to the rapid decline of both cytosolic and nuclear PPARγ in the presence of IFN-γ. Our studies clearly demonstrated that the IFN-γ-induced loss of PPARγ protein is partially inhibited in the presence of two distinct proteasome inhibitors. Moreover, IFN-γ also inhibited the transcription of PPARγ, which was accompanied by a decrease in PPARγ mRNA accumulation. In addition, exposure to IFN-γ resulted in a substantial increase in STAT 1 expression and a small increase in STAT 3 expression. IFN-γ treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (48–96 h) resulted in a substantial inhibition of insulin-sensitive glucose uptake. These data clearly demonstrate that IFN-γ treatment results in the development of insulin resistance, which is accompanied by the regulation of various adipocyte transcription factors, in particular the synthesis and degradation of PPARγ.

The recent consideration of adipose tissue as an endocrine organ that secretes a variety of unrelated bioactive molecules has broadened our understanding of adipocyte function to exceed its previously considered passive role in lipid metabolism. A number of cell lines are available for studying adipocytes. The 3T3-L1 cell line differentiates under the controlled conditions of cell culture from fibroblasts, or preadipocytes, to cells with the morphological and biochemical properties of adipocytes (1Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 2Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). The 3T3-L1 adipocytes are comparable with native adipocytes as they have the ability to accumulate lipid, respond to insulin, and secrete leptin. The major transcription factors involved in adipocyte gene regulation include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, proteins belonging to the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family, and adipocyte determination and differentiation-dependent factor 1, also known as sterol regulatory element-binding protein (reviewed in Refs. 3Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; Suppl. 32–33: 59-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 4Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have also suggested that the signaltransducer and activator oftranscription (STAT)1 family of transcription factors may also be important in fat cells. The STAT family of transcription factors is comprised of seven family members (STATs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5A, 5B, and 6) that, in response to the stimulation of various receptors, mainly those for cytokines, are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, which causes their translocation to the nucleus. Each STAT family member shows a distinct pattern of activation by cytokines and upon nuclear translocation can regulate the transcription of particular genes in a cell- or tissue-specific manner (5Darnell J.E.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). In fat cells, the expression of STATs 1, 5A, and 5B is highly induced during differentiation and correlates with lipid accumulation (6Stephens J.M. Morrison R.F. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10441-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 7Stewart W.C. Morrison R.F. Young S.L. Stephens J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The regulation of STAT expression has also been investigated in NIH 3T3 cells ectopically overexpressing C/EBPs β and δ, a condition that results in adipogenesis (8Wu Z. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies, the expression of STATs 1, 5A, and 5B was induced in a PPARγ ligand-dependent fashion during adipogenesis (9Stephens J.M. Morrison R.F. Wu Z. Farmer S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). STATs 3 and 6 are also expressed in adipocytes, but the expression of these proteins does not change during differentiation. However, the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 3 occurs following the induction of differentiation, and studies with antisense STAT 3 suggest that this protein may be important in adipogenesis (10Deng J. Hua K. Lesser S.S. Harp J.B. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although the functions of STATs in fat cells have not been identified, numerous studies suggest that these transcription factors may be important regulators of adipocyte gene expression. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is primarily known for its roles in immunological responses but also has been shown to affect fat metabolism and adipocyte gene expression. In adipocytes, IFN-γ treatment results in a decrease of lipoprotein lipase activity and increased lipolysis (11Doerrler W. Feingold K.R. Grunfeld C. Cytokine. 1994; 6: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In 3T3-F442 adipocytes, exposure to IFN-γ results in a decreased expression of lipoprotein lipase and fatty acid synthase. Also in various rodent preadipocyte cell lines, IFN-γ inhibits the differentiation of preadipocytes (12Gregoire F. De Broux N. Hauser N. Heremans H. Van Damme J. Remacle C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Keay S. Grossberg S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have recently shown that acute IFN-γ treatment of cultured and native adipocytes results in a dose- and time-dependent activation of STATs 1 and 3 (15Stephens J.M. Lumpkin S.J. Fishman J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31408-31416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Exposure of adipocytes to IFN-γ results in the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STATs 1 and 3 in fat cells. Because IFN-γ has effects on adipocyte gene expression, we examined the effects of this cytokine on the expression of a variety of adipocyte transcription factors. Although we observed that IFN-γ affected the expression of a number of adipocyte transcription factors, the most profound effect of IFN-γ was on the expression of PPARγ. PPARγ is a member of the nuclear hormone superfamily and exists as two isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, which are transcribed from the same gene by the use of alternative promoters (16Zhu Y. Qi C. Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Noya D. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7921-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). PPARγ2 is 30 amino acids longer than PPARγ1 and is largely adipocyte-specific. Although expressed in a variety of other tissues, PPARγ1 is also predominately expressed in fat (17Chawla A. Schwarz E.J. Dimaculangan D.D. Lazar M.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are high affinity synthetic ligands of PPARγ and have recently been shown to affect the degradation of this transcription factor (18Hauser S. Adelmant G. Sarraf P. Wright H.M. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18527-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Our studies with IFN-γ also indicate that PPARγ is targeted to the proteasome for degradation, but this is not the only mechanism for the substantial effect that IFN-γ has on PPARγ expression. Our findings indicate that a newly identified inhibitor of PPARγ expression, IFN-γ, results in a substantial loss of PPARγ expression by regulating two cellular events as follows: 1) targeting PPARγ to the proteasome for degradation and 2) inhibiting the synthesis of PPARγ. Prolonged IFN-γ treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes also results in the development of insulin resistance and regulation of other adipocyte transcription factors and supports the hypothesis that PPARγ is involved in conferring insulin sensitivity. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Bovine and fetal bovine serum was obtained from Sigma and Life Technologies, Inc., respectively. Murine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Actinomycin D was purchased from Calbiochem. Cycloheximide was purchased from Sigma. The nonphospho STAT antibodies were either monoclonal IgGs purchased from Transduction Laboratories or polyclonal IgGs from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. A highly phospho-specific polyclonal antibody for STAT 1 (Y701) was provided by Quality Controlled Biochemicals. PPARγ was a mouse monoclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. SREBP-1, C/EBPα, and ERK1/ERK2 were rabbit polyclonal antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were plated and grown to 2 days postconfluence in DMEM with 10% bovine serum. Medium was changed every 48 h. Cells were induced to differentiate by changing the medium to DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 μmdexamethasone, and 1.7 μm insulin. After 48 h this medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and cells were maintained in this medium until utilized for experimentation. Monolayers of 3T3-L1 adipocytes were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested in a nondenaturing buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 50 trypsin inhibitory milliunits of aprotinin, 10 μmleupeptin, and 2 mm sodium vanadate. Samples were extracted for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. Supernatants containing whole cell extracts were analyzed for protein content using a BCA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell monolayers were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested in a nuclear homogenization buffer (NHB) containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, and 3 mmMgCl2. Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.15%, and cells were homogenized with 16 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. Supernatants were saved as cytosolic extract, and the nuclear pellets were resuspended in 0.5 volume of NHB and centrifuged as before. The pellet of intact nuclei was resuspended again in 0.5 of the original volume of NHB and centrifuged again. A small portion of the nuclei was used for trypan blue staining to examine the integrity of the nuclei. The majority of the pellet (intact nuclei) was resuspended in an extraction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 25% glycerol. Nuclei were extracted for 30 min on ice and then placed at room temperature for 10 min. Two hundred units of DNase I were added to each sample, and tubes were inverted and incubated an additional 10 min at room temperature. Finally, the sample was subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. Supernatants containing nuclear extracts were analyzed for protein content. Proteins were separated in 5, 7.5, or 12% polyacrylamide (acrylamide from National Diagnostics) gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) according to Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. Following the transfer, the membrane was blocked in 4% milk for 1 h at room temperature. Results were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Total RNA was isolated from cell monolayers with TriZOL (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction with minor modifications. For Northern blot analysis, 20 μg of total RNA was denatured in formamide and electrophoresed through a formaldehyde-agarose gel. The RNA was transferred to Zeta Probe-GT (Bio-Rad), cross-linked, hybridized, and washed as previously described (20Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13580-13584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Probes were labeled by random priming using the Klenow fragment (Promega) and [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The assay of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose was performed as previously described (21Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21839-21845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to the assay, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-deprived for 2–4 h. Uptake measurements were performed in triplicate under conditions where hexose uptake was linear, and the results were corrected for nonspecific uptake and absorption determined by 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake in the presence of 5 μm cytochalasin B (Sigma). Nonspecific uptake and absorption were always less than 10% of the total uptake. Following exposure of fully differentiated adipocytes to IFN-γ for 1 h, the cell monolayers (six 10-cm plates per time point) were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and nuclei were isolated, and run-on transcription assays were performed as we have previously described (20Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13580-13584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of adipocyte transcription factors was examined following a time course of IFN-γ treatment on fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 1, immunoblotting of whole cell extracts demonstrated that IFN-γ treatment resulted in a significant decrease in PPARγ2 (upper band) and -γ1(lower band) within 24 h and resulted in a notable decline in C/EBPα. The expression of STATs 1 and 3 increased following a 24-h IFN-γ treatment. The expression of STATs 5A, 5B, and 6 was not regulated by exposure to IFN-γ treatment. Also, the expression of SREBP-1 decreased after a 48-h treatment. The spliced 67-kDa form of SREBP-1 was similarly decreased with IFN-γ treatment (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, a 24-h treatment of IFN-γ resulted in a substantial loss of PPARγ2 and -γ1 protein expression. Therefore, we examined the effects of IFN-γ over a 24-h time course. Whole cell extracts were isolated from fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes that were treated with IFN-γ for the various times indicated in Fig.2. Interestingly, IFN-γ resulted in a substantial loss of PPARγ2 and -γ1 expression within 6 h. In addition, we observed a striking increase in STAT 1 expression between 8 and 12 h and a small increase in STAT 3 during this time period. There was no change in STAT 5A during this time course. JAK 1, the kinase that activates STAT 1 in adipocytes, increases slightly with IFN-γ treatment. In addition, fatty acid synthase expression decreased with IFN-γ treatment. Clearly, an analysis of whole cell extracts reveals a substantial loss of PPARγ2 and -γ1 expression in adipocytes following IFN-γ treatment. However, it was unclear whether IFN-γ had any effect on the amount of PPARγ proteins present in the adipocyte nucleus. To further examine the inhibition of PPARγ by IFN-γ, we performed another time course in which adipocytes were fractionated to isolate cytosolic and nuclear extracts. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 3, the majority of PPARγ2 and -γ1 protein was present in the nucleus, and the amount of nuclear PPARγ protein was substantially reduced after 6 h. A darker exposure of this blot indicates the presence of PPARγ proteins in the cytosol in untreated adipocytes and cells that were exposed to IFN-γ for 30 min. However, following a 6-h or greater IFN-γ treatment, there was no detectable PPARγ2 or -γ1 in the cytosol and a significant loss of both PPARγ isoforms in the nucleus. We also observed an increase in STAT 1 in the cytosol between 6 and 12 h and the presence of activated STAT 1 in the nucleus following a 30-min treatment with IFN-γ. Detection of the phosphorylated form of STAT 1 was performed with an antibody specific for phosphorylation on tyrosine 701 (STAT 1 Y701). Analysis with either one of these STAT 1 antibodies demonstrates the presence of STAT 1 in the nucleus following a 30-min IFN-γ stimulation. However, the STAT 1 Y701antibody is more sensitive, and we observed this protein in the nucleus even after a 12-h IFN-γ treatment. We have previously reported that STAT 5A is present in the nucleus of adipocytes under basal conditions (15Stephens J.M. Lumpkin S.J. Fishman J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31408-31416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and IFN-γ treatment does not cause a redistribution of this protein. Therefore, STAT 5A (Fig. 3, bottom panel) is shown to indicate the even loading of both cytosolic and nuclear samples. The rapid loss of PPARγ1 and -γ2 proteins in the presence of IFN-γ suggested that the PPARγ proteins may be labile. Therefore, we examined the decay of PPARγ and STATs in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Whole cell extracts were isolated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes at various times following the addition of 5 μm cycloheximide (+CH) or ethanol (−CH), a vehicle control. As shown in Fig. 4, the inhibition of protein synthesis resulted in the loss of PPARγ by 12 h with over half of the protein decayed by 6 h. A log plot of the remaining protein versus time was used to estimate the half-life of PPARγ and of adipocyte-expressed STAT proteins. The estimated half-life of these proteins is indicated in Fig. 4 and is an average calculation of three independent experiments. PPARγ1 and -γ2 are labile compared with the STAT proteins, which have half-lives at least twice as long as the PPARγ proteins. We also investigated the effect of IFN-γ on PPARγ in the presence of cycloheximide. Because of experimental variability, it was difficult to quantitate the decrease in the half-life of the PPARγ proteins in the presence of IFN-γ. However, in each experiment, the decay of the PPARγ was quicker in the presence of IFN-γ, as shown in Fig.5. Adipocytes were treated with 5 μm cycloheximide in the presence or absence of IFN-γ, and whole cell extracts were isolated at 0, 1, and 4 h. As shown in Fig. 5, the decay of both PPARγ2 and -γ1 is increased in the presence of IFN-γ with a complete loss of PPARγ1 at 4 h.Figure 5PPAR γ turnover is increased in the presence of IFN-γ. Whole cell extracts were prepared from 3T3-L1 adipocytes following various periods of treatment with 5 μm cycloheximide or ethanol in the presence or absence of IFN-γ. One hundred μg of each extract was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to Western blot analysis. Samples were processed and results were visualized as described in the legend to Fig. 1. This is a representative experiment independently performed three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TZD treatment has also been shown to decrease PPARγ expression. Therefore, we compared the effects of IFN-γ and englitazone (ENG), a TZD, on the expression of PPARγ in adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 6, fully differentiated adipocytes were exposed to IFN-γ or ENG alone or in combination. In the first combination, adipocytes were treated with IFN-γ 1 h prior to the addition of englitazone. In the second combination, adipocytes were treated with englitazone 1 h prior to the addition of IFN-γ. For each combination, whole cell extracts were isolated 5 h after initiation of the experiment. These results demonstrate that the combination of both inhibitors of PPARγ expression resulted in an even greater decrease in PPARγ expression than one agonist alone. The results of the cycloheximide experiments in Fig. 5 suggest that the decay of PPARγ2 and -γ1 is increased in the presence of IFN-γ. Therefore, we examined PPARγ expression in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 7, a 6-h treatment of either epoxomicin or lactacystin had little effect on the levels of PPARγ2 or -γ1 protein. A 6-h IFN-γ treatment resulted in a substantial loss of PPARγ protein, but the IFN-γ-induced loss of PPARγ2 and -γ1 was inhibited in the presence of either epoxomicin or lactacystin. Notably, the presence of these two different proteasome inhibitors did not restore PPARγ2 and -γ1 to the levels found in untreated adipocytes, suggesting that protein degradation is only one manner in which IFN-γ regulates PPARγ expression. In the presence of the two proteasome inhibitors, there were no differences in the levels of any STATs or ERK1/ERK2. Interestingly, the IFN-γ-induced increase in STAT 1 was blunted in the presence of epoxomicin or lactacystin, suggesting that the IFN-γ-induced increase in STAT 1 may be dependent on the degradation of some protein(s). These experiments indicate that, in addition to having an effect on the turnover of the PPARγ proteins, there is presumably another means by which IFN-γ causes a decrease in PPARγ expression. Therefore, we examined the effect of IFN-γ on PPARγ mRNA accumulation. As shown in Fig. 8, a 2-h IFN-γ treatment resulted in a substantial loss of PPARγ mRNA. Northern blot analysis cannot distinguish between the two forms of PPARγ. A decrease in C/EBPα and GLUT4was also observed following a 20-h IFN-γ treatment. In addition, we observed an increase in the levels of both C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ following an IFN-γ treatment. A notable decrease in aP2/422was observed after a 12-h treatment with IFN-γ. The expression of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD), a gene whose expression is elevated in adipocytes, was substantially decreased following a 20-h treatment with IFN-γ. Following a 24-h IFN-γ treatment, there was also a slight decline in adipsinmRNA. The hybridization of β-actin is shown to represent the even loading of the samples. Because the IFN-γ-induced loss of PPARγ mRNA was relatively rapid, we predicted that the decay of the PPARγ mRNA would be brief compared with C/EBPα. Therefore, we investigated the turnover of these two transcription factor mRNAs. Total RNA was isolated from cells at various times after treatment with actinomycin D. As shown in Fig. 9 A, the PPARγ mRNA decayed rapidly compared with the C/EBPα mRNA. We estimated the half-life of the PPARγ mRNA to be less than 3 h. We also examined the decay of PPARγ in the presence of IFN-γ to determine whether this growth factor had any effect on the stability of the PPARγ mRNA. We found that the decay of PPARγ mRNA was not altered in the presence of IFN-γ as indicated in Fig.9 B. These results strongly suggested that IFN-γ would have an effect on the transcription of PPARγ. To determine whether the IFN-γ-induced changes in PPARγ and C/EBPα mRNA accumulation shown in Fig. 8 were attributable to the effects on synthesis, we measured the transcription rates of these genes in nuclei isolated from control and IFN-γ-treated adipocytes. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to cycloheximide (±IFN-γ) for 1 h. As shown in Fig.10, a substantial suppression of both PPARγ and C/EBPα was observed following IFN-γ treatment, indicating that the effect of IFN-γ on the transcription of these genes was independent of new protein synthesis. IFN-γ had no effect on β-actin transcription (data not shown). IFN-γ is known to have effects on both lipolysis and lipogenesis, so we investigated the effect of this growth factor on basal and insulin-sensitive glucose uptake. As shown in TableI, serum-deprived 3T3-L1 adipocytes had a 6.7-fold increase in glucose uptake following a 10-min treatment of 100 nm insulin. After a 24-h treatment of IFN-γ, cultured adipocytes were still responsive to insulin (6.13-fold increase). However, following a 48-h treatment of IFN-γ, when both PPARγ and C/EBPα were substantially decreased (Fig. 1), there was a discernible decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (4.42-fold increase). Exposure to IFN-γ for 72 and 96 h had no effect on basal glucose uptake but resulted in a substantial decrease in insulin-sensitive glucose uptake. Following a 96-h IFN-γ exposure, there was only a 2.2-fold increase following insulin treatment. IFN-γ treatment for more than 96 h did not result in a further decline of insulin-sensitive glucose uptake (data not shown). The IFN-γ-induced effects on insulin sensitivity do not appear to be a result of any significant lipid loss as there were no distinguishable differences in Oil Red O staining from control and IFN-γ-treated (96 h) adipocytes (data not shown).Table IThe effect of IFN-γ on insulin-sensitive glucose transportBasalInsulin-stimulated-Fold increasepmol/min/mg proteinControl67 ± 12449 ± 386.7024-h IFN-γ64 ± 4392 ± 406.1348-h IFN-γ66 ± 10292 ± 284.4272-h IFN-γ56 ± 6212 ± 203.8096-h IFN-γ53 ± 8117 ± 132.20 Open table in a new tab IFN-γ affected the expression of many adipocyte transcription factors, including PPARγ2 and -γ1, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, SREBP-1, STAT 1, and STAT 3. However, the most profound effect of IFN-γ was on PPARγ expression. These studies have also revealed that both the PPARγ mRNA and protein are labile compared with other adipocyte transcription factors. IFN-γ treatment of adipocytes leads to a decrease in PPARγ that is the result of the inhibition of transcription coupled with an increase in the degradation of PPARγ2 and -γ1. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that thiazolidinedione treatment of the 3T3-F442A adipocytes results in a reduction of PPARγ protein that is distinct from mRNA regulation (18Hauser S. Adelmant G. Sarraf P. Wright H.M. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18527-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In that study, the data indicated that the TZD treatment of adipocytes resulted in the ubiquitination of PPARγ and subsequent degradation that was dependent on the proteasome complex (18Hauser S. Adelmant G. Sarraf P. Wright H.M. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18527-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). These results are comparable with the effects we observed with IFN-γ. In our studies, two distinct proteasome inhibitors affected PPARγ2 and -γ1 protein levels in the presence of IFN-γ but had little effect in adipocytes lacking cytokine stimulation. In summary, both TZD and IFN-γ treatments of adipocytes appear to target PPARγ to the proteasome for degradation. Moreover, our observations on the lability of PPARγ proteins suggest that PPARγ turnover is an important event. The inhibition of proteasome activity in the presence of IFN-γ did not restore the PPARγ proteins to normal cellular levels, and we observed a potent effect of IFN-γ on PPARγ transcription and mRNA accumulation. These results have led us to hypothesize that IFN-γ-induced STAT 1 activation in fat cells may be responsible for the transcriptional suppression of PPARγ. Cross-talk between STATs and PPARs has been demonstrated in liver cells (22Zhou Y.C. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2672-2681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We are currently initiating studies to identify the IFN-γ-sensitive element in the PPARγ promoters and determine whether STAT 1 is directly involved in the transcriptional suppression of PPARγ. Although STATs are generally thought to be transcriptional activators, there is evidence that this family of transcription factors can also act as repressors of transcription (23Luo G. Yu-Lee L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26841-26849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These studies have led us to hypothesize that IFN-γ-induced STAT 1 dimers directly bind to the PPARγ promoters and result in an inhibition of transcription. The effects of IFN-γ on PPARγ degradation are less expected. Numerous studies have shown that serine phosphorylation of PPARγ on Ser112 by mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1/ERK2 and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase) results in a strong suppression of PPARγ activity (24Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 25Zhang B. Berger J. Zhou G. Elbrecht A. Biswas S. White-Carrington S. Szalkowski D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), which in part appears to involve ligand binding (28Shao D. Rangwala S.M. Bailey S.T. Krakow S.L. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Our previous studies in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes have demonstrated that IFN-γ resulted in both STAT 1 and STAT 3 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation (15Stephens J.M. Lumpkin S.J. Fishman J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31408-31416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, unlike other cytokines, IFN-γ did not result in the activation of ERK1/ERK2 in adipocytes. Therefore, it does not appear that ERK1/ERK2-induced serine phosphorylation of PPARγ could be involved in the effects of IFN-γ that we observed on PPARγ degradation. Our results are supported by the findings of Spiegelman and co-workers (18Hauser S. Adelmant G. Sarraf P. Wright H.M. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18527-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), which indicate that the phosphorylation of PPARγ on Ser112 is not required for its down-regulation. However, we have not examined the role of serine phosphorylation in the IFN-γ-induced PPARγ degradation or the effect of IFN-γ on the activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase in adipocytes. Although the mechanism by which IFN-γ directs PPARγ to the proteasome for degradation is not known, it is clear that the turnover of PPARγ is further increased when both IFN-γ and a PPARγ ligand are present. Perhaps IFN-γ could either modulate the phosphorylation state of PPARγ or have an effect on the synthesis of an endogenous PPARγ ligand. Alternatively, IFN-γ-induced PPARγ degradation could occur via a pathway that is independent of ligand-induced degradation. It is interesting to note that the analysis of PPARγ mutants by the Spiegelman laboratory demonstrated that the TZD-induced PPARγ decay was not strictly dependent on its transcriptional activity but was dependent upon the ligand-gated activation function (AF-2) domain. In these studies, ligand binding and the activation of the AF-2 domain not only increased the transcriptional function of PPARγ but also induced ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Unlike TZDs, which are insulin sensitizers, IFN-γ treatment of adipocytes resulted in a condition of insulin resistance, as measured by insulin-sensitive glucose uptake and a decrease in the expression of adipocyte genes, such as GLUT4, aP2/422,GPD, and adipsin. PPARγ has been implicated in the regulation of systemic insulin sensitivity, and some PPARγ mutations are associated with severe insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus (29Barroso I. Gurnell M. Crowley V.E. Agostini M. Schwabe J.W. Soos M.A. Maslen G.L. Williams T.D. Lewis H. Schafer A.J. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. Nature. 1999; 402: 880-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). In our studies, the most profound effect of IFN-γ was on PPARγ expression, which was significantly decreased after only 6 h. Interestingly, we did not observe any substantial effects on insulin-sensitive glucose uptake even after a 24-h treatment of IFN-γ despite the dramatic loss of PPARγ expression. Following a 48-h treatment, we did observe a substantial inhibition of insulin-sensitive glucose uptake. At this time, there was also a marked effect on C/EBPα expression. These studies suggest that the loss of PPARγ may be insufficient to confer insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, the low levels of PPARγ observed after a 24- and 48-h IFN-γ treatment may be sufficient levels of PPARγ expression to account for the insulin responsiveness of these cells. Alternatively, the primary role of PPARγ may be to regulate the expression of other transcription factors, such as C/EBPα. Nonetheless, the increase in PPARγ turnover and the inhibition of PPARγ synthesis induced by IFN-γ are prominent because of the relatively rapid decay of both the PPARγ mRNA and the protein. Because the regulation of PPARγ is the first observed effect of IFN-γ on adipocyte transcription factor expression, this event is likely very important in the development of IFN-γ-induced insulin resistance. IFN-γ treatment also results in a decrease of GLUT4, aP2, GPD, andadipsin expression in adipocytes. However, there is no notable difference in the morphology of the cells, and there is no observable difference in Oil Red O staining from untreated 3T3-L1 fully differentiated adipocytes and those that have been treated for 96 h with IFN-γ (data not shown). In conclusion, the tightly controlled regulation of PPARγ synthesis and degradation that we observed in the presence of IFN-γ suggests that the cellular levels of PPARγ are a meaningful effector of gene expression."

Olfactory sensory neurons have a half-life of about 90 days and are continually renewing. This poses the problem of how this precise spatial map is maintained throughout the life of the organism. We have developed a genetic approach to effect the synchronous ablation of subpopulations of neurons expressing a given receptor. The axons of newly generated neurons can then be followed as they enter the brain and converge on glomerular targets during adult life. The observation that following neuronal cell killing, the spatial map is faithfully restored, demonstrates that the information necessary for the establishment of the sensory map persists throughout the life of the organism."

Significantly, the rdgB-PITP region, comprising 266 amino acids, can be expressed as a soluble protein that exhibits both PtdIns and PtdCho transfer activities. We have solved the structure of rat PITPα bound to phosphatidylcholine using x-ray diffraction techniques. The results provide a framework for understanding the interactions of PITPs with lipid molecules and membrane surfaces in lipid transport processes and with other cellular proteins during signaling and trafficking events. There were two criteria that guided all crystallization experiments: use of unmodified protein and maintenance of a protein-bound ligand of physiological significance. Considerable biochemical data have accumulated indicating that the C-terminal residues of PITP exhibit a conformational change upon binding to membranes. We therefore avoided the use of truncated or tagged proteins, particularly at the C-terminus. To improve the likelihood that a bound phospholipid would be observed in the x-ray data, no detergents of any kind were employed in any step of purification or crystallization. Cells of Escherichia coliB834(DE3), a methionine auxotroph containing plasmids for expression of groELS and rat PITPα (21Tremblay J.M. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Yarbrough L.R. J. Biol.

A three-wavelength MAD x-ray data set was collected, with one wavelength at the selenium absorption edge, one at the absorption peak, and one at a low energy remote (TableI).

The β-sheet is antiparallel, except for the orientation of strands 1 and 7, which are parallel. There are three long α-helices, composed of 5 to 7 turns (A, F, and G), and four shorter α-helices, each with less than two complete turns (B, C, D, and E). Helices A and F are oriented on the interior side of the β-sheet, with helix A aligned coincident with strand 2 and helix F oriented diagonally across the β-sheet. The phospholipid is clearly visible in the electron density map (Fig.3), with the binding site between the interior side of the β-sheet and α-helices A and F.Figure 3A stereo diagram of the electron density map in the vicinity of the choline group in the lipid-binding core.

These areas consisted of residues 239–242 connecting helix F to G (containing one of the undetected selenium sites at Met241) and residues 263–271 at the C terminus. The solvent-exposed side chain density of residues on helix G is somewhat weak, although the interior, buried sidechain density is unambiguous. The solvent-exposed Met247 has very weak side chain density and is one of the undetected selenium sites from the MAD data. The last undetected selenium site is residue 1, for which no electron density is observed. We designate the dominant region of the PITP structure as the lipid-binding core. This region, a cavity in which the phospholipid molecule binds, is formed by α-helices A and F and the β-sheet. Limited segments of helices A and F and strands 4 and 5 are amphipathic and provide excellent hydrophobic interaction with the phospolipid molecule (Fig.4). The lipid-binding core comprises residues 1–118 and 191–232. Examination of the PITP structure reveals that the intervening residues 119–190 form an extensive loop region between strands 7 and 8. Postulating that this loop is likely required for the association of PITP with a wide variety of lipid- and protein-modifying enzymes, we refer to this region as the regulatory loop. The recent identification of Ser166 as a site for limited protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation (32van Tiel C.M. Westerman J. Paasman M. Wirtz K.W.A. Snoek G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21532-21538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) supports this hypothesis. All PITPs and rdgBs studied to date contain a regulatory loop region; only Caenorhabditis elegans PITP lacks the equivalent Ser166 phosphorylation site. The remaining residues in the structure comprise the C-terminal residues 233–271. Consisting of the long α-helix G as the principal secondary structural element and an additional 11 residues that limit access to the lipid-binding cavity, we call this region the C-terminal region and suggest its critical participation in membrane association and dissociation. The C-terminal region is the least conserved region among the cytosolic PITPs and is replaced in the rdgB proteins by up to 1000 additional amino acids, some of which appear to be transmembrane. Our functional region designation correlates reasonably well to the location of conserved amino acid residues in the PITP family (Fig. 1). The majority (nearly 75%) of the absolutely conserved amino acids are located in the lipid-binding core. Most of the others are part of the regulatory loop. Consistent with their proposed functions, both the regulatory loop and the C-terminal region were predicted to exhibit significant polypeptide backbone flexibility (33Karplus P.A. Schultz G.E. Naturwissenschaften. 1985; 72: 212-213Crossref Scopus (939) Google Scholar), a structural feature corroborated by specific B factors from the x-ray data. The residues in close proximity to the PtdCho head group are shown in Figs. 3 and4. The majority of these interacting residues are highly conserved in all PITP and rdgB proteins. Nine water molecules are within 3.2 Å of the phospholipid or an amino acid residue lining the phospholipid cavity. The phosphate oxygen O1P forms hydrogen bonds with the NZ atom of the conserved Lys195 and a water molecule, and oxygen O2P hydrogen bonds with the OG1 atom of the conserved Thr97 and another water molecule. The solvent-accessible volume of the phospholipid-binding cavity (calculated with a 1.4 Å probe) is 670 Å3, whereas the molecular-surface volume is 2725 Å3. The van der Waals volume of the PtdCho molecule is 671 Å3. Of the 271 residues in the protein, 72 residues (27%) have atoms contributing to the lipid cavity. Characteristics of the interactions between PITP and the hydrophobic region of PtdIns and PtdCho molecules have been described (34van Paridon P.A. Gadella Jr., T.W.J. Somerharju P.J. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6208-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35Kasurinen J. van Paridon P.A. Wirtz K.W.A. Somerharju P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8548-8554Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Using lipids with defined fatty acyl species at theirsn-1 and sn-2 positions, combined with one or more fluorescent acyl derivatives (pyrenylacyl, parinaroyl), both binding to PITP and protein-catalyzed transfer from a vesicle surface were measured. For the sn-1 group a broad range of structures could be accommodated, with preference for 14- and 16-carbon saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids; nevertheless, 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids were still bound and transferred. In contrast, the sn-2 group exhibits a more restricted range, preferring 16- and 18-carbon mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids whose double bonds were toward the methyl-end of the lipids. PtdCho molecules containing arachidonate (20:4n-6) or docosahexaenoate (22:6n-3) in the sn-2 position bind weakly to PITP. It was suggested that the sn-2 binding site in PITP was “bottle-shaped,” with the neck toward the ester linkage. Little difference was observed for acyl chain preferences between the PtdIns and PtdCho class of phospholipids. In the PITP structure reported here, the PtdCho ligand contains two oleate (18:1n−9) acyl groups. The conformation of the sn-2 acyl chain is more extended than the sn-1 chain, such that the sn-2 group extends almost to the surface of the protein. The lipid cavity follows the contour of the sn-2 acyl chain closely, but the cavity around the sn-1 chain is less confining. These features may explain the poor binding of phospholipid molecules with sn-2 acyl moieties longer than 18 carbons and the less restrictive range of groups accommodated in thesn-1 acyl region of the cavity. PITP preferentially binds PtdIns and PtdCho. Whereas PtdCho was used in the experimental protocol, inositol can be readily modeled into the electron density for the choline moiety (except for the sugar hydroxyls). There are numerous charged or polar amino acid residues in the region that may be potential hydrogen bonding partners to the inositol hydroxyls (Fig. 5). Nevertheless, the tertiary structure of the model does not completely explain polar head group specificity of PITP, for which further studies are needed. To transfer a phospholipid, PITP must first bind to the membrane, exchange its bound lipid for a membrane lipid, and then dissociate from the membrane. Previous studies have shown that there are significant conformational changes in the C-terminal residues when PITP binds to lipid membranes (21Tremblay J.M. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Yarbrough L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21075-21080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although cytosolic PITP is highly resistant to trypsin digestion, protein bound to membranes is rapidly cleaved at Arg253 and Arg259. In the crystal structure these two sites are part of helix G in the C-terminal region. Studies have shown that generally sites that are subject to limited proteolytic cleavage by trypsin assume a loop-like structure with a conformation similar to that of trypsin inhibitors (36Hubbard S.J. Eisenmenger F. Thornton J.M. Prot. Sci. 1994; 3: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Thus, this helix must “melt” prior to cleavage by trypsin, a process facilitated by interaction with a membrane surface. The relative instability of portions of this helix is supported by the highB factors calculated for residues 243–250. Residues 260–271 also appear to be important for maintaining a tight compact structure. PITPs truncated at residues 253 or 259 have more relaxed conformations than full-length PITP, defined by increased quenching of Trp fluorescence by acrylamide, increased Tyr exposure, increased reactivity of Cys, and increased anilino-naphthalene sulfonate binding (37Voziyan P.A. Tremblay J.M. Yarbrough L.R. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12526-12531Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Inspection of the native structure shows that such changes cannot be caused by removal and exposure of residues without a conformational change in the remainder of the protein. Several studies have shown that removal of one or a few amino acids from the N- or C-terminus of a protein may have a significant effect on protein stability and/or dynamics without producing major changes in conformation (38Trevino R.J. Gliubich F. Berni R. Cianci M. Chirgwin J.M. Zanotti G. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13938-13947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39de Prat Gay G. Ruiz-Sanz J. Neira J.L. Corrales F.J. Otzen D.E. Ladurner A.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Our data on the conformation and biological activity of truncated PITPs are consistent with a critical role of the C-terminus in the complete packing of the hydrophobic core and folding and stabilization of the native structure. The ability of PITP to bind phospholipid substrates is necessary but not sufficient for subsequent phospholipid transfer. Removal of up to 20 C-terminal residues greatly reduces phospholipid transfer, yet these truncated proteins produced in E. coli contain PtdGro, or less commonly, phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) with a near normal 1:1 stoichiometry (37Voziyan P.A. Tremblay J.M. Yarbrough L.R. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12526-12531Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 40Hara S. Swigart P. Jones D. Cockcroft S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14908-14913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hence, residues 254–271 are dispensable for lipid binding, although they are important in conferring selectivity for PtdIns and for efficient transfer of phospholipids. It is not immediately obvious from the PITP structure why phospholipids such as PtdEtn and phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) are bound and/or transferred so poorly. We had earlier reported that residues 260–271 could be eliminated with variable effects on transfer activity that reflected the composition of the membranes employed in the assay system (41Tremblay J.M. Voziyan P.A. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Yarbrough L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1389: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). With membranes containing only PtdCho, the truncated PITP (1) has transfer activity identical to the full-length protein. However, with as little as 2% PtdOH in the donor and/or acceptor membranes, transfer activity decreases to 0–20% relative to that observed with PtdCho membranes. Such concentrations have minimal effect on transfer by native PITP. We demonstrated that this and the more extensively truncated PITP (1) have greatly enhanced affinities for membrane binding, which would result in inefficient lipid transfer activity. We suggest that the C-terminal region of PITP acts to maintain a low affinity of the full-length protein for membranes, especially those containing acidic phospholipids. Structural perturbations within the C-terminal region lead to enhanced electrostatic interactions and increased membrane affinity (41Tremblay J.M. Voziyan P.A. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Yarbrough L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1389: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the tertiary structure of PITP provides an opportunity to evaluate studies describing and characterizing the random mutagenesis of the cDNA encoding rat PITPα (42Alb Jr., J.G. Gedvilaite A. Cartee R.T. Skinner H.B. Bankaitis V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8826-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mutations of amino acids Ser25, Thr59, Pro78, and Glu248 were, in general, observed to abolish PtdIns transfer, whereas PtdCho transfer was not affected. With the exception of Ser25, all are absolutely conserved among PITPs and rdgBs. Our data support a role of the Thr59 hydroxyl group in a putative hydrogen bonding interaction with the inositol moiety (Fig. 5) and place Ser25 in the vicinity of the fatty acid-glycerol ester linkages. Glu248 makes a salt bridge with the conserved Lys61 in a region close to the choline and inositol polar head group moieties. Pro78 is near the end of the portion of the cavity that accommodates the sn-2 acyl chain. Why mutations of these residues impact selectively and variably on PtdIns binding and transfer remains unresolved. Mutations to Glu6 and Pro12, two absolutely conserved residues, yield poor expression of recombinant mammalian PITP in a yeast host (42Alb Jr., J.G. Gedvilaite A. Cartee R.T. Skinner H.B. Bankaitis V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8826-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Based on our structure, these residues likely stabilize the association between the lipid-binding core and the regulatory loop. Glu6 participates in salt bridges with the conserved Arg8 and with His127; similarly, Pro12 packs tightly against the conserved Leu174. Analysis of the exterior features of PITP, such as charge distribution and hydrophobicity, provided little insight into what region might constitute the membrane-binding surface. We presently favor a model in which the C-terminal region is a part of this surface. In the interaction between protein and membrane, most if not all of the C-terminal region must be displaced from helix A in the lipid-binding core and acquire increased backbone flexibility sufficient to melt a portion of helix G and become sensitive to proteolytic digestion. We further envision that the refolding and reassociation of the C-terminal region with the bulk protein provides a driving force for eventual dissociation of PITP from the membrane surface. The detailed mechanism by which PITP releases its bound lipid, exchanges it for another present in the membrane surface and dissociates from the membrane remains to be elucidated. A plausible model is one in which the C-terminal region of the protein binds to the membrane and the lipid-binding core opens, somewhat like a clam shell, exposing its bound lipid to the membrane surface. The protein-bound lipid is absorbed into the membrane and replaced by a membrane lipid. Subsequently, the C-terminal region refolds and reassociates with the body of the protein, i.e. the clam shell closes, and the protein dissociates from the membrane surface. The affinity for the membrane surface and the affinity for a specific phospholipid must not be too great, otherwise dissociation and transfer would be too slow and inefficient. As suggested above, the decreased rate of membrane dissociation, at least in part, makes C-terminal-truncated PITP derivatives weak catalysts of lipid exchange with membranes containing acidic phospholipids. To account for other biological activities of PITP, we suggest that the protein-bound phospholipid becomes accessible to phosphorylation following interaction of a lipid kinase with a complementary site on PITP, perhaps on the regulatory loop. One-third of the residues within this 72-amino acid segment are identical or >90% conserved among all PITP and rdgB proteins (Fig. 1). Protein-protein interactions are proposed to alter the conformation of PITP at the head group region of the lipid-binding core (Fig. 6). This could lead to either the presentation of PtdIns to the active site of a membrane-bound PtdIns 4-kinase or the exposure of the inositol moiety of a PITP-bound PtdIns to the action of a soluble PtdIns 3-kinase or 4-kinase (43Balla T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 44Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Evidence supporting such a function of PITP in substrate presentation to a PtdIns 3-kinase has been reported (10Panaretou C. Domin J. Cockcroft S. Waterman M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2477-2485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Following modification of the inositol 3- or 4-hydroxyl function, the affinity of the product for PITP would likely decrease so significantly that it would remain with the kinase or return to the lipid surface. Consistent with this mechanism is the inability of PITP to bind and transfer PtdIns (4Swigert P. Insall R. Wilkins A. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 837-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)P (45Schermoly M.J. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Brain Res. 1983; 268: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Using the DALI algorithm (30Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3561) Google Scholar) to search for proteins structurally similar to PITP, the recently described START (StAR-related lipid-transfer) domain (46Ponting C.P. Aravind L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 130-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) was identified as sharing significant tertiary structure. MLN64 (PDB:1EM2), a protein associated with some human breast carcinomas, has served as a prototype for structure determination and mechanistic studies of the START domain (47Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The MLN64 START domain contains a hydrophobic tunnel that extends the length of the protein with small openings on both ends. A nine-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and two α-helices form an interior hydrophobic chamber that is believed to be just large enough to accommodate a single molecule of cholesterol. Cholesterol was not included in the crystallization solutions, but docked into the finished protein model. START domain proteins are proposed to bind lipids and interact with membranes, properties also common to PITPs. Steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, whose function is to deliver cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane and cytochrome P450scc, contains a START domain near its C-terminus. Nearly the entire sequence of PtdCho transfer protein (PCTP), another cytosolic lipid transfer protein, constitutes a single START domain. In contrast to PITP, PCTP has a marked specificity for PtdCho and highly restricted tissue expression in mammals (2Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although not identified by the DALI search, the recently reported structure of sterol carrier protein-2 (PDB 1QND, Ref. 48Garcia F.L. Szyperski T. Dyer J.H. Choinowski T. Seedorf U. Hauser H. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) is another example of a protein with a lipid-binding core similar to that observed in MLN64 and PITP. Despite reasonable similarity at the secondary and tertiary levels of structure (Fig. 7), there is no primary structure homology between members of the PITP family and proteins with a START domain. It should be noted that the lipid cavity in PITP is larger than the cavity in MLN64. Upon superposition, one of the α-helices comprising the putative lipid-binding cavity of MLN64 clashes with the sn-1 acyl chain of the bound PtdCho in the PITP structure. This is not surprising in that PITP binds diacyl phospholipids, whereas MLN64 binds the more compact cholesterol molecule. The START and PITP protein families represent an excellent example of functional evolutionary convergence to generate comparable domain architecture and related biological function from apparently unrelated genetic information. Fungi and plants contain Sec14p, a cytosolic protein that transports PtdIns and PtdCho (13Cockcroft S. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 49Kearns B.G.

Recently, the three-dimensional structure ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae Sec14p, one member of this conserved family, was reported (53Sha B. Phillips S.E. Bankaitis V.A. Luo M. Nature. 1998; 391: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). PITP and Sec14p are similar in size, exhibit similar in vitro lipid-binding specificity and transport abilities and display significant and highly complementary interspecies activity. However, the two proteins have little structural similarity. In contrast to the PITPα·PtdCho structure, Sec14p structure has no bound phospholipid molecule. Elucidation of the PITPα·PtdCho structure reveals a complex amphipathic lipid completely enclosed within a folded polypeptide cavity. The three functional regions of the protein provides a molecular framework for understanding the details of protein-lipid interactions on several levels. Within its lipid-binding core, PITP has been shown to sequester phospholipids from the aqueous environment. Lipid ligand specificity, whereas not completely explained by the tertiary structure, is dictated by extensive noncovalent interactions. The C-terminal region of PITP is proposed to promote the transient association to and dissociation from lipid surfaces. Through its regulatory loop, PITP is thought to present lipid substrates to kinases for subsequent phosphorylation. Further mutagenic and structural studies of PITP and other members of the PITP-rdgB family are required to test these and other hypotheses. Detailed analyses of PITP interactions with membranes and kinases are needed to gain a more meaningful understanding of the role of PITP in cellular phospholipid metabolism."

Using activation-based and competition-based assays, we are able to quantitatively evaluate the contributions that residues/regions within MKP3 make to ERK2 binding and ERK2-induced MKP3 activation. Our results show that recognition and activation of MKP3 by ERK2 involves multiple regions of MKP3. Thus, the kinase interaction motif (KIM; residues 61–75) in MKP3 plays a major role (135-fold) for high affinity ERK2 binding. The most important residue in the KIM sequence of MKP3 is Arg65, which probably interacts with Asp319 in ERK2. In addition to KIM, a unique sequence conserved in cytosolic MKPs (residues 161–177 in MKP3) also contributes to ERK2 binding (15-fold). However, these two regions are not essential for ERK2-induced MKP3 activation. A third ERK2 binding site is localized in the C terminus of MKP3 (residues 348–381).

There are three major MAP kinase cascades: the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway, which responds to stimuli that induce proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenic transformation; the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase pathway; and the p38 kinase pathway, the last two of which are activated in response to environmental stresses and cytokines that mediate inflammation. MAP kinase activity is tightly regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Activation of MAP kinase activity requires dual phosphorylation of both Thr and Tyr residues in the activation loop motif TXY. One mechanism for MAP kinase inactivation involves the action of MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs). The MKPs are dual specificity phosphatases that are capable of catalyzing the removal of the phosphoryl group from Tyr(P) as well as Thr(P). MKPs are unrelated to the serine/threonine protein phosphatases but belong to the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) superfamily (4Zhang Z.-Y. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). At least nine mammalian MKPs have been identified (5Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB. J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 6Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). These MKPs share two common structural features: a conserved catalytic domain that contains the PTPase active site signature motif (H/V)CX5R(S/T) and an N-terminal domain containing two conserved motifs that are also found in the cell cycle regulator Cdc25 phosphatases. Interestingly, however, each MKP appears to have distinct specificity for its substrate MAP kinase. For example, MKP3 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and is highly specific in dephosphorylating and inactivating ERK1/2 (7Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R. Martinou J.C. Martinou I. Camps M.

Gillieron C. Smith A. Chabert C. Camps M. Boschert U. Rodrigues N. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9323-9329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and purified recombinant ERK2 stimulates the phosphatase activity of MKP3 (12Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). We sought to understand how these findings contribute to the specificity of MKP3 to ERK2. To gain insight into the mechanism of ERK2-induced MKP3 activation, we have carried out a detailed kinetic analysis of the MKP3-catalyzed aryl phosphate hydrolysis both in the absence and presence of ERK2 (13Zhou B. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35526-35534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that, like PTPases, MKP3 can exist either in a general acid loop open or closed conformation. Normally, MKP3 is in the open state in which the active site residues (Cys293 and Arg299) are misaligned and the general acid (Asp262) is positioned away from the active site (14Stewart A.E. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. McDonald N.Q. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For PTPases, the loop that contains the general acid is brought into the active site as a result of the interactions between the phosphoryl moiety in the substrate and the side chain of the active site Arg, which in turn enables the Arg residue to interact with a hinge residue in the general acid loop (15Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Stuckey J.A. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1904-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Keng Y.-F. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism for loop closure could also occur in MKP3 that allows the repositioning of catalytic groups and the reorienting of the electrostatic environment at the active site. However, unlike PTPases, the rate of this substrate-induced conformational change in MKP3 depends on the nature of the substrates. It appears that with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as a substrate, the interaction between the substrate and MKP3 is not sufficient to allow the attainment of optimal alignment of active site residues with respect to the substrate. Because ERK2 is a physiological substrate of MKP3, it can engage in specific protein-protein interactions with MKP3 and elicit full activation of MKP3 activity by facilitating the repositioning of active site residues and general acid loop closure in MKP3 (13Zhou B. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35526-35534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Fjeld C.C. Rice A.E. Kim Y. Gee K.R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6749-6757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Catalytic activation by MAP kinases has also been observed with other MKPs. In addition, catalytic activation mirrors the substrate selectivity of MKPs; an MKP is only activated by its physiological substrates (5Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB. J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 6Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 12Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a general mechanism by which all members of the MKP family are regulated; the MKPs exist in latent, inactive states, and upon association with specific MAP kinase substrates, the MKPs are activated, leading to selective inactivation of MAP kinases. The molecular basis for the specific MKP activation by MAP kinases is not understood. Our hypothesis is that molecular determinants responsible for the specific MAP kinase-MKP interactions are contained within the interacting proteins themselves. The goal of the current study is to determine the structural features in MKP3 that are important for ERK2 binding as well as ERK2-induced activation. Our results provide a molecular basis by which MKP3 recognizes ERK2 showing how specific interactions between ERK2 and MKP3 modulate the intrinsic catalytic activity and possibly the substrate specificity of MKP3. The coding sequence for the wild type MKP3 with a C-terminal His6 tag was produced by PCR using the oligonucleotides GGCCATATGATAGATACGCTCAGACCCG (NdeI site underlined) and GCCGAATTCTCAGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCGTAGATTGCAGGGAGTC (EcoRI site and His6 tag underlined) as the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively, using pGEX-4T3-MKP3 (a generous gift from Dr. Marco Muda, University of Michigan) as a template. The PCR product, containing a 5′ NdeI site and 3′ EcoRI site and nucleotides encoding MKP3 and a His6 tag immediately before the stop codon, was subcloned into the pET21a vector (Novagen). MKP3/C293S was produced by the same procedure using pGEX-4T3-MKP3/C293S as the PCR template. To produce C-terminal truncations of MKP3, the oligonucleotide GGCCATATGATAGATACGCTCAGACCCG (NdeI site underlined) was used as the 5′ primer, and GCCGAATTCTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCAGGGTCCTTTCAAAGTC (for MKP3/1–347), GCCGAATTCTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGAGAGTCCTTGGCACAGC (for MKP3/1–222), and GCCGAATTCTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCTGGCTGTTGGACAG (for MKP3/1–203) were used as the 3′ primers (EcoRI site and His6 tag underlined). To produce the N-terminal truncations of MKP3 by PCR, the oligonucleotides GCCCATATGGGCTCGTGCAGCAGCAGCT (for MKP3/152–381), GCCATATGTCCTTCCCGGTGGAGATTTTG (for MKP3/204–381) were used as the 5′ primers (NdeI site underlined), and GCCGAATTCTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCGTAGATTGCAGGGAGTC was used as the 3′ primer (EcoRI site and His6tag underlined). To produce MKP3/204–347, the oligonucleotides GCCATATGTCCTTCCCGGTGGAGATTTTG (NdeI site underlined) and GCCGAATTCTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCAGGGTCCTTTCAAAGTC (EcoRI site and His6 tag underlined) were used as the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. The coding sequence of these truncated versions of MKP3, containing a 5′ NdeI site and 3′ EcoRI site and nucleotides encoding a His6 tag immediately before the stop codon, were amplified by PCR from pGEX-4T3-MKP3 and were subcloned into the pET21a vector. To produce MKP3/ΔKIM, in which amino acids 61–75 were deleted from the MKP3 sequence, oligonucleotides GCCCGGGTCTATTCACGCGCTGCGAGGA (SmaI site underlined), and GCCGAATTCTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCGTAGATTGCAGGGAGTC (EcoRI site and His6 tag underlined) were used to PCR-amplify the MKP3 sequence from residue 76 to 381 from pGEX-4T3-MKP3 and to introduce SamI and EcoRI restriction sites and a C-terminal His6 tag immediately flanking the stop codon at the C terminus. Then the DNA fragment encoding the sequence of MKP3 from 76–381 amino acids was ligated into the plasmid pET21a-MKP3-His6 fragment containing residues 1–60 of MKP3 after digesting with SmaI andEcoRI. The point mutations of MKP3 were generated by PCRs according to the standard procedure of the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the pET21a-MKP3-His6plasmid (or pET21a-MKP3/152–381-His6, pET21a-MKP3/ΔKIM-His6) as a template. All MKP3 mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Full-length MKP3 with a C-terminal His6 tag was expressed and purified using standard procedures of rapid affinity purification with the pET His tag system (Novagen) with minor modifications. Briefly, pET21a-MKP3-His6 was transformed into BL21(DE3) competent cells by standard procedure. A single colony was selected and grown in LB medium (supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin) at 37 °C overnight. A 10-ml overnight culture was transferred to 1 liter of LB medium (supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin) and allowed to grow at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm was between 0.6 and 0.8. Following the addition of isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, the culture was incubated at room temperature with shaking for an additional 6 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm (Sorvall Centrifuge, SS-34 rotor) for 5 min. The cell pellets from 1 liter of culture were resuspended in 30 ml of lysate buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole). The cells were lysed by passage through a French pressure cell press at 1,200 p.s.i. twice. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 30 min. A 4-ml 50% slurry of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen; preequilibrated by lysate buffer) was added to the supernatant. After incubating with gentle agitation at 4 °C for 2 h, the matrix was transferred to a column and washed by 20 bed volumes of lysate buffer and 20 bed volumes of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole. The His6-tagged protein was eluted by washing the column with 10 bed volumes of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mmNaCl, 100 mm imidazole. The elute was concentrated with a Centriprep-30 filtration unit (Amicon), and the buffer was changed to 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The mutants of MKP3 were expressed and purified by the same procedures as the wild-type MKP3. Protein concentration of MKP3 and its mutants was determined using the Bradford dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) diluted according to the manufacturer's recommendations with bovine serum albumin as standard. pGEX-2T-ERK2 (a generous gift from Dr. Chris Marshall of the Institute of Cancer Research, London) was used to transform BL21(DE3). GST-ERK2 fusion protein was expressed and purified as described (18Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). After thrombin cleavage at room temperature for 1 h, ERK2 was eluted from the GST-ERK2-bound glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin. The elute was concentrated with a Centriprep-30 filtration unit (Amicon). Protein concentration of ERK2 was determined using the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.10 ml mg−1 cm−1. All of the purified proteins were made to 20% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. The phosphatase activity of MKP3 or its mutants was assayed using pNPP as a substrate at 30 °C in 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA with an ionic strength of 0.15m adjusted by the addition of NaCl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme to a reaction mixture (0.2 ml) containing various concentrations of pNPP and quenched after 60 min by the addition of 0.05 ml of 5 n NaOH. The range of substrate concentration used was 0.2–5 Km. The nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by measuring the control without the addition of enzyme. After quenching, 0.2 ml of reaction mixture was transferred to a 96-well plate. The amount of product p-nitrophenol was determined from the absorbance at 405 nm detected by a Spectra MAX340 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) using a molar extinction coefficient of 18,000m−1 cm−1. The Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters were determined from a direct fit of the velocity versus substrate concentration data to Michaelis-Menten equation using the nonlinear regression program KinetAsyst (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA). The dissociation constants of MKP3 and its mutants for ERK2 were determined by the activation assay or competitive binding assay at 30 °C and pH 7.0, in 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate buffer, containing 1 mm EDTA with an ionic strength of 0.15 madjusted by the addition of NaCl. For MKP3 and its mutants possessing phosphatase activity, the activation assay was used to determine the binding affinity of MKP3 or its mutants for ERK2. In this assay, the reaction was initiated by the addition of MKP3 in a reaction mixture (0.2 ml) containing 40 mm pNPP and various concentration of ERK2 and quenched after 60 min by the addition of 0.05 ml of 5 n NaOH. The enzymatic and nonenzymatic hydrolysis of pNPP were measured as described above. The dissociation constant Kd was calculated by fitting the absorbance at 405 nm versus ERK2 concentration data to Equation 1, A=A0−(A0−A∞)×(CM+CE+Kd)−(CM+CE+Kd)2−4×CM×CE2×CMwhere A is the absorbance at 405 nm of the sample in the presence of ERK2; A0 is the absorbance at 405 nm in the absence of ERK2; A∞ is the absorbance at 405 nm when the concentration of ERK2 is infinite;CM is the MKP3 concentration, which is fixed at 0.1 μm; CE is the ERK2 concentration during titration; and Kd is the dissociation constant for ERK2 binding to MKP3. For peptides corresponding to the kinase interaction motif (KIM) and the N-terminal fragments of MKP3, which lack phosphatase activity, the competitive binding assay was used to determine the binding affinity for ERK2. In this assay, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 μm MKP3 in a mixture (0.2 ml) containing 20 mm pNPP, 1.2 μm ERK2, and various concentration of the KIM peptide or the MKP3 mutant. The reaction was stopped after 60 min by the addition of 0.05 ml of 5 nNaOH. The enzymatic and nonenzymatic hydrolysis of pNPP were measured as described above. The data were fitted to Equation 2 (19Zhang Y.-L. Keng Y.-F. Zhao Y. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab All experiments were performed at 30 °C and pH 7.0. All isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed using an MCS Isothermal Titration Calorimetry System from Microcal Inc. (Northampton, MA). Experiments at pH 7.0 were conducted at 25 °C, in 50 mm3,3-dimethylglutarate buffer. The ionic strength of the buffer was adjusted to 0.15 m by the addition of NaCl. The ERK2 concentration in the cell of the calorimeter was 90 μm, while the KIM peptide in the syringe was 1 mm. High concentration stock solutions were prepared for the peptides with 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate buffer. The stock was diluted to 1 mm with the buffer before titration. The binding data were analyzed using the Origin software (20Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). The binding constantK and the enthalpy change ΔH were used to calculate the free energy change ΔG and the entropy change ΔS according to −RTlnK = ΔG = ΔH −TΔS, where R is the gas constant andT is the absolute temperature. The binding interactions between ERK2 and MKP3 or its mutants were examined by GST pull-down and Western blot assay. GST-ERK2 (10 μg) in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 2 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.3) was immobilized on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by incubating with gentle agitation at 4 °C for 2 h. MKP3 or its mutants (1 μg) in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline were incubated with 20 μl of GST-ERK2 bound beads with gentle agitation at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing the beads with phosphate-buffered saline buffer, 25 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer was added to the beads. The proteins were released by boiling the beads for 5 min. The sample was microcentrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant (10 μl) was loaded on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. When the electrophoresis was complete, the proteins on the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using a Trans-Blot SD semidry electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 150 mA and room temperature for 1 h. After blocking in 15 ml of 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6) for 1 h at room temperature, the membrane was incubated with mouse anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (sc-8036; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) with gentle agitation overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed three times with TBS-T and incubated with goat anti-mouse monoclonal antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (sc-2005; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T with gentle agitation for 1 h at room temperature. The immunocomplexes were detected by chemiluminescence upon incubation with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was immediately exposed to Kodak BioMax Light Film for 10 s to 2 min to visualize the bound MKP3. Peptides were synthesized on Rink amide resin (Advanced Chemtech, Louisville, KY) using a standard protocol for 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/N-hydroxybenzotriazole/N-methylmorpholine activation of Fmoc-protected amino acid derivatives (Advanced Chemtech, Louisville, KY). Side chains of Asp, Glu, Ser, and Thr weretert-butyl-protected; Asn, Gln, and His were trityl-protected; Lys was tert-butyloxycarbonyl-protected; and Arg was protected with the 4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethyl-benzenesulfonyl group. The coupling reaction was performed inN,N-dimethylformamide for 1.5 h using a 3-fold excess of amino acid. Fmoc removal was performed with 20% piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide. The N terminus of the peptides was acetylated with 2.5% acetic anhydride and 5% N,N-diisopropylethylamine inN,N-dimethylformamide for 15 min. Final cleavage and side chain deprotection was achieved with 1 mtrimethylsilyl bromide, 1 m thioanisole in trifluoroacetic acid with 5% 1,2-ethanedithiol and 1% m-cresol for 15 min under a blanket of nitrogen at 0 °C. The resin was removed by filtration, and the remaining trifluoroacetic acid solution was concentrated under nitrogen flow. Dry diethyl ether was added, and the precipitated peptides were collected by centrifugation. The peptides were resuspended, washed twice with ether, dissolved in water, and purified by semipreparative reverse phase HPLC. All peptides were obtained in high yield (>80%) and in high purity (>95%, as analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry and analytical HPLC). The catalytic activity of MKP3 againstpNPP increases when it binds to ERK2 (12Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). To determine the stoichiometry of MKP3 binding to ERK2, the dependence of the MKP3-catalyzed pNPP hydrolysis on the ratio of MKP3 to ERK2 was measured, while keeping the total concentration of MKP3 and ERK2 constant. Fig. 1 shows that maximumpNPP hydrolysis is reached at an MKP3 to ERK2 ratio of 1:1, indicating a 1:1 binding stoichiometry between MKP3 and ERK2. We have found that the activation of MKP3 by ERK2 is dose-dependent and saturable (13Zhou B. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35526-35534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). From the concentration dependence of ERK2 on the kinetic parameters kcat/Km(determined at low [pNPP], e.g. 0.1 mm, ∼0.08 Km) orkcat (determined at saturating [pNPP], e.g. 40 mm, ∼31Km) for the MKP3-catalyzed reaction, we can determine the dissociation constant (Kd) for ERK2-MKP3 and ERK2-MKP3·pNPP complexes, respectively. The Kd value of ERK2 for the MKP3·pNPP complex determined by this activation-based assay is 0.17 ± 0.04 μm at pH 7.0 and 30 °C (Fig. 2), which is similar to the affinity of ERK2 for free MKP3 (data not shown). In addition, we can also determine the maximal level of MKP3 activation upon the addition of ERK2. The kcat increases 9-fold and theKm decreases 8-fold for the MKP3-catalyzedpNPP hydrolysis, resulting in a nearly 70-fold increase in the second order rate constant,kcat/Km (TableI). Thus, the concentration dependence of activation of MKP3 pNPP phosphatase activity by ERK2 provides a powerful means to quantitatively assess the importance of structural features in MKP3 for ERK2 recognition, both in terms of binding affinity for ERK2 and the ability to be activated by ERK2.Figure 2Concentration dependence of ERK2 on the MKP3-catalyzed pNPP reaction. The concentration of pNPP was 40 mm, and the concentration of MKP3 was 0.10 μm. The absorbance at 405 nm monitored the amount of p-nitrophenol produced. The data were fitted to Equation 1 to determine the Kd value of ERK2 for the MKP3·pNPP complex (13Zhou B. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol.

Considering that mitochondria are the main intracellular source of oxygen radicals, and based on the recently documented production of NO⋅ by intact mitochondria, we investigated whether NO⋅, produced by the mitochondrial nitric-oxide synthase, could affect the generation of oxygen radicals. Toward this end, changes in H2O2production by rat liver mitochondria were monitored at different rates of endogenous NO⋅ production. The observed changes in H2O2 production indicated that NO⋅affected the rate of oxygen radical production by modulating the rate of O2 consumption at the cytochrome oxidase level. This mechanism was supported by these three experimental proofs: 1) the reciprocal correlation between H2O2production and respiratory rates under different conditions of NO⋅ production; 2) the pattern of oxidized/reduced carriers in the presence of NO⋅, which pointed to cytochrome oxidase as the crossover point; and 3) the reversibility of these effects, evidenced in the presence of oxymyoglobin, which excluded a significant role for other NO⋅-derived species such as peroxynitrite. Other sources of H2O2 investigated, such as the aerobic formation of nitrosoglutathione and the GSH-mediated decay of nitrosoglutathione, were found quantitatively negligible compared with the total rate of H2O2 production.

Lancaster Jr., J. Nitric Oxide: Principles and Actions. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 1-71Crossref Google Scholar and references therein). Decreases in the rate of oxygen free radical production are often attributed to the diffusion-controlled reaction between O⨪2 and NO⋅, which yields peroxynitrite. Increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are usually associated with the damage and/or inactivation of mitochondrial components by peroxynitrite or peroxynitrite-like species. Considering that under physiological conditions mitochondria constitute the main intracellular source of oxygen free radicals (2Boveris A. Oshino N. Chance B. Biochem.

The accurate documentation of the rates of production of nitrogen and oxygen radicals is an essential step to understanding the role of these interactions in different, more complex pathophysiological situations and underlines the relevance of studying the mechanisms behind these processes in relatively simpler models. Furthermore, transient changes in ROS production have become an area of intense research given the growing interest in the role of ROS as mediators of signal transduction pathways, organ preconditioning (9Van den Hoek T.L.

In this study, we examined the rates of O2 free radical production by intact mitochondria under various conditions of endogenous NO⋅ production; different mechanisms underlying the NO⋅-O⨪2 interactions were quantitatively investigated. Herein, we demonstrated that mitochondria could generate O⨪2and NO⋅; however, unlike other biological systems, no irreversible damage to mitochondrial components was observed. The enhanced ROS production detected under NO⋅-producing conditions was attributed to an increase in the steady-state level of reduced components of the respiratory chain, whereas a small contribution was attributed to the aerobic decay of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) in the presence of GSH. Finally, the implications of these results were discussed in terms of the ability of NO⋅ to modulate the rates of oxygen free radical production and/or consumption and the pathophysiological consequences associated with this process. EDTA, EGTA, sodium succinate, sodium malate, sodium glutamate, mannitol, sucrose, HEPES, bovine serum albumin (fatty acid free), l-arginine, antimycin, 2× crystallized scopoletin, and desferrioxamine mesylate were purchased from Sigma. Catalase and horseradish peroxidase (Grade I) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Oxymyoglobin was obtained as described before (5Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol.

Liver mitochondria were isolated from adult Wistar rats by differential centrifugation and purified through Percoll centrifugation (5Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). This procedure yielded intact mitochondria minimally contaminated with other subcellular compartments (5Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Essentially, male rats (body weight of 180–220 g) were anesthetized using a CO2 chamber. The livers were quickly removed; washed with 0.22 m mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm Hepes, and 0.1% defatted bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4 (Buffer A); and homogenized in a 10:1 buffer to liver w/w ratio. Large cell debris and nuclei were pelleted by centrifuging at 600 × g for 5 min in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. This supernatant was filtered through two layers of cheesecloth to remove fat. Mitochondria were pelleted by centrifuging the supernatant for 10 min at 10,300 × g in the same rotor. After suspending the pellet in 5 ml of the previous buffer, the mitochondrial fraction was loaded on 20 ml of 30% (v/v) Percoll, 0.225m mannitol, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm Hepes, and 0.1% defatted bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, and spun for 30 min at 95,000 × g in a Beckman 60Ti rotor. Mitochondria, collected from the lowest band, were washed once with Buffer A and twice with 0.15 m KCl. Mitochondrial pellets were gently suspended in a small volume of ice-cold Buffer A. The respiratory control and phosphate to oxygen ratios of these purified mitochondria were 6.5 ± 0.2 and 2.8 ± 0.1, respectively, assessed in 0.225 m sucrose, 5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, and 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4 (reaction medium) supplemented with 10 mm succinate and 0.25 mmADP. The oxygen uptake of mitochondria was measured using a Clark-type O2 electrode from Hansatech (King's Lynn, UK) at 30 °C (5Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 7Giulivi C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Intact, purified mitochondria (0.5–2 mg of protein/ml) were maintained in 1 ml of reaction medium in the presence of 10 mm succinate as substrate and, where indicated, different amounts of l-Arg orN G-monomethyl-l-arginine (NMMA). The production of NO⋅ by mitochondria (1–2 mg/ml) was evaluated as the change in the absorbance at 581–592 nm at 22 °C using a dual wavelength, double beam SLM-Aminco DW-2C UV-visible spectrophotometer. The sample cuvette contained 2 ml of reaction medium, 0.1–0.3 mmoxymyoglobin, 10 mm succinate, and 0.1 mml-arginine under constant stirring. When NMMA was used in the incubation, the protein concentration was 3–5 mg/ml. Ten μm catalase and superoxide dismutase were also present in the reaction medium to avoid unspecific side reactions (namely, the reaction of NO⋅ with the superoxide anion or of oxymyoglobin with peroxynitrite/hydrogen peroxide); however, no significant changes were found with or without these enzymes. The rates of NO⋅production were taken during the first 4–5 min when the ratios of myoglobin:catalase (in heme):NO⋅ were 28:6:1, thereby avoiding a significant, if any, inhibition of catalase by NO⋅. Thel-citrulline production was monitored by a modified colorimetric technique from Prescott and Jones (11Prescott L.M. Jones M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The rate of H2O2 production by intact mitochondria (0.12–0.15 mg of protein/ml) was measured in reaction medium with 5 μm horseradish peroxidase and 1 mm scopoletin (12Boveris A. Martino E. Stoppani A.O.M. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 80: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This high concentration of scopoletin was required to compete with GSH for the horseradish peroxidase-H2O2complex (data not shown). The recovery of H2O2was 80–90% assayed with glucose/glucose oxidase. Sample preparation proceeded as follows. Aliquots of the reactions were withdrawn at different time points. The aliquots were treated to avoid thiol oxidation or thiol-disulfide exchange, to terminate any metabolic process, and to prevent any artifactual GSNO production. To satisfy these criteria, the samples were kept on ice protected from light during the duration of the procedure and promptly precipitated with perchloric acid in the presence of a metal chelator, desferrioxamine mesylate. The samples (0.8 ml) were treated with 20 μl of 10 mm desferrioxamine mesylate and 36 μl of 70% perchloric acid, kept on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were treated with 1 volume of 0.15m K2HPO4, 10 mm sodium citrate, and 5 mm EDTA (phosphate-citrate-EDTA). The samples were kept on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were filtered through a 2-μm filter and kept at −80 °C until HPLC analysis, usually performed during the same day. The samples were analyzed by HPLC using a modified method from Stamler and Feelisch (13Stamler J.S. Feelisch M. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996: 521-539Google Scholar). The separation and detection of GSNO were performed by using a C18 Aqua HPLC column (column specifications: length and inner diameter, 250 mm × 4.6; particle size, 5 μm) (Phenomenex™, Torrance, CA) connected with a SecurityGuard™ column from the same manufacturer (4 × 3 mm C18 cartridge). The different components were eluted with an isocratic gradient of 99% 0.1 m monochloroacetic acid, 0.125 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm sodium octyl sulfate, pH 2.8, and 1% acetonitrile. The mobile phase was purged with helium, and the flow rate was set at 0.8 ml/min. The chromatography equipment consisted of a Class-VP Shimadzu HPLC system equipped with two high pressure LC10ADvp pumps and an automatic injector Sil-10ADvp. The chromatograms were analyzed using the software provided with the system (version 5.03). The peaks were monitored by a photodiode array detector (215 and 336 nm) and an electrochemical detector (L-ECD-6A from Shimadzu set at −300 mV) connected in series. The identification of the derivatives was performed by comparison with synthetic GSNO. This latter compound was prepared according to Hart (14Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2016Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar) by acid-catalyzed nitrosation of GSH (Elemental analysis: Found, C, 34.5; H, 4.9; N, 15.2; S, 9.0; H2O, 0.94; C10H16N4O7S· H2O requires C, 34; H, 5.1; N, 15.8; S, 9.1; H2O, 5.1%). Fresh solutions of GSNO were prepared immediately before each experiment, and the concentrations were confirmed spectrophotometrically at 334 nm. Protein concentration was determined by biuret assay (15Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the modifications introduced by Yonetani (16Yonetani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1680-1686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. and were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The addition of increasing concentrations ofl-Arg to intact, coupled mitochondria in State 4 (using either glutamate-malate or succinate) stimulated the production of NO⋅ (Fig. 1 A). The initial velocity plotted versus l-Arg concentration represented a right rectangular hyperbola; theV max and K m values were 1.5 nmol of NO⋅ × (min · mg protein)−1 and 5 μm, respectively. Comparable results were obtained by measuring l-citrulline, cosynthesized with NO⋅ by NOS (V max = 1.2 ± 0.2 nmol ofl-citrulline/min × mg of protein andK m = 8 μm). The rate of NO⋅production was negligible at l-Arg concentrations of 50–100 × K m. This effect was accompanied by an increase in the rate of oxygen consumption (3–5 times), found to be resistant to ADP stimulation, and comparable with the increase obtained in the presence of carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. These experimental observations indicated that the lack of NO⋅ production at high concentrations of l-Arg was attributed to the uncoupling of mitochondria by this amino acid. The rates of NO⋅ production in mitochondria, maintained in State 4, were decreased significantly when NMMA was included in the reaction mixture (Fig. 1 A). The addition of this compound did not affect the V max but increased the apparent K m values (15 and 30 μm, respectively). These results indicated that this compound is acting as a competitive inhibitor of mitochondrial NOS, as has been shown by other reports (17Feldman P.L. Griffith O.W. Hong H. Stuehr D.J. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Olken N.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9677-9685Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 19Olken N.M. Osawa Y. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14784-14791Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). TheK I was calculated from the slope of a plot ofK m(app) versus [NMMA] (Fig.1 B), resulting in a value (15 μm) similar to that reported for mouse-inducible NOS (13 μm) (18). Even at high concentrations of NMMA (0.5 mm), a slow rate of NO⋅ was detectable (0.02 nmol of NO⋅ × (min · mg protein)−1) not accompanied byl-citrulline production. This slow rate has been attributed to the nonenzymatic release of NO⋅ from GSNO in the presence of reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase. 2M. Steffen, T. Sarkela, A. A. Gybina, T. W. Steele, N. J. Traaseth, D. Kuehl, and C. Giulivi, Biochem. J., in press. To examine whether endogenous NO⋅ affected the mitochondrial production of oxygen free radicals, the production of H2O2 and the oxygen consumption of intact mitochondria were assessed under different conditions of NO⋅ generation. Mitochondria were supplemented with either malate-glutamate or succinate during the experiments to ensure a nonlimiting pool of NADPH, required for the activity of NOS. The addition of l-Arg to intact, coupled substrate-supplemented mitochondria increased the rate of H2O2 production in a dose-response manner (Fig.2 A). The concentrations ofl-Arg required for the half-maximal effect were 29.6 μm (glutamate-malate) and 34 μm(succinate). At saturating concentrations of l-Arg, the rate of H2O2 production increased by 42% (glutamate-malate) and 58% (succinate), whereas the respiratory rates decreased 33% (glutamate-malate) and 27% (succinate) (Fig.2 B). The concentrations of l-Arg required for the 50% inhibition of the respiratory rates were 24.7 μm(glutamate-malate) and 31.5 μm (succinate). The effects observed on the respiratory rates and H2O2production were completely reversed by adding 0.2–1 mmoxymyoglobin to the reaction mixture (not shown). These latter experiments might wrongly indicate that the rate of H2O2 production was decreased by the reaction of H2O2 with oxymyoglobin via its pseudocatalatic/peroxidatic activity, without the participation of NO⋅. This possibility seemed unlikely based on the following evidence. First, the rate constants for the reaction of oxymyoglobin or oxyhemoglobin with H2O2 in their peroxidatic and catalatic activities are 4–5 orders of magnitude smaller than those corresponding to the reaction of oxymyoglobin with NO⋅(21Giulivi C. Hochstein P. Davies K.J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 16: 123-129Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 22Saunders B.C. Holmes-Siedle A.G.

Inorg. Biochem. 1981; 14: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), indicating that this molecule will preferentially react with oxymyoglobin rather than with H2O2. Second, the addition of NMMA, which blocks the production of NO⋅ by mitochondrial NOS (independently of the presence of oxymyoglobin) decreased the rate of H2O2production, excluding the role of oxymyoglobin in the modulation of H2O2 production by NO⋅-producing mitochondria (see below). The addition of NMMA to l-Arg- and succinate-supplemented mitochondria decreased the rate of H2O2production and increased the respiratory rates in a dose-response manner (Fig. 3, A andB, respectively). The concentrations of NMMA required for the half-maximal rate of H2O2 production were 13.9 (glutamate-malate) and 13.8 μm (succinate); at saturating concentrations of NMMA, the rate of H2O2 production was decreased 42% (malate-glutamate) and 37% (succinate). The concentrations of NMMA required for the half-maximal respiratory rates were 15.7 (glutamate-malate) and 10.2 μm (succinate); at saturating concentrations of NMMA, the respiratory rates were increased by 85% (malate-glutamate) and 39% (succinate). The effects observed on the respiratory rates and H2O2 production mediated by NMMA were completely reversed by adding increasing amounts ofl-Arg (not shown). The reciprocal association between ROS and NO⋅ production with the O2 uptake (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, TableI) and the similar concentrations of NMMA and l-Arg required for the half-maximal effects for the NO⋅ production, respiratory rates, and H2O2 production (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) indicated that these events were biochemically linked, acting at a common site. The involvement of NO⋅ in these effects was supported by the reversibility of the effects observed with NMMA (upon the addition ofl-Arg) and l-Arg (upon the addition of oxymyoglobin). These results also precluded a significant role for peroxynitrite because this species causes irreversible damage of respiratory chain components (24Radi R. Rodrı́guez M. Castro L. Telleri R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the fact that oxymyoglobin reversed the modulation of the O2 uptake and ROS production not only excluded ONOO− but also the involvement of other NO⋅-derived species, such as nitrate, also produced in the presence of oxymyoglobin (23Doyle M.P. Hoekstra J.W. J. Inorg.

Although the association between respiratory rates, hydrogen peroxide production, and NO⋅ generation was apparent from these results, no quantitative correlation was demonstrated. Moreover, given the fact that mitochondria are endowed with a pool of GSNO2and that its synthesis (25Gow A.J. Buerk D.G. Ischiropoulos H. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) at rates that may be significant, we sought to explore these processes using quantitative strategies. The major mitochondrial thiol is constituted by glutathione (about 10 mm) (27Giulivi C. Cadenas E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Glutathione is synthesized in the cytosol, imported to the mitochondria, and involved in a protective role against oxidative stress (28Meister A. Science. 1983; 220: 470-477Crossref Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Thiols react with NO⋅ and/or its metabolites, resulting in the formation of stable NO⋅ donors or nitrosothiols (29Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Jaraki O. Osborne J.A. Francis S. Mullins M. Singel D. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8087-8091Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Recent reports suggest that the formation of GSNO in vivomay include the production of O⨪2 via the oxidation of the intermediate GSNO⨪ (25Gow A.J. Buerk D.G. Ischiropoulos H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2841-2845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) (Equations 1 and 2). GS−+NO⋅→[GSNO⨪−]Equation 1 [GSNO⨪−]+O2→GSNO+O⨪2Equation 2 If this mechanism had been active in mitochondria, assuming oxygen is the only suitable electron acceptor for Equation 2, increases in NO⋅ production would have been followed by increases in the rates of O⨪2 and GSNO production. Studies were undertaken to explore the occurrence of this mechanism in mitochondria and to explore whether the increase in oxygen radical production observed in NO⋅-producing mitochondria could be associated with the formation of GSNO. In addition, the decay of GSNO, which includes a complex chemistry of homolytic and heterolytic mechanisms (26Singh S.P. Wishnok J.S. Keshive M. Deen W.M. Tannenbaum S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 30Wong P.S.-Y. Hyun J. Fukuto J.M. Shirota F.N. DeMaster E.G. Shoeman D.W. Nagasawa H.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5362-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), could also result in the production of hydrogen peroxide. Toward this end, the rates of the production and decay of GSNO were evaluated in terms of their potential to contribute to the rate of hydrogen peroxide produced by mitochondria.The concentration of GSNO from intact mitochondria (analyzed and quantified by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures”) was 0.37 ± 0.03 nmol/mg of protein, and its rate of production (under optimal conditions for NO⋅production) was 10–20 pmol of GSNO (min mg · protein)−1. According to the mechanism outlined before, if this rate were equivalent to that of O⨪2 production (see Equation 2), it would have represented a small fraction (3–5%) of the rate of hydrogen peroxide obtained with NO⋅-producing mitochondria (Table I), constituting a minor contribution to the total rate of H2O2 production. The decay of GSNO may result in H2O2 production if the pathway indicated in Fig.4 is operative. To evaluate the contribution to the rate of H2O2 by GSNO decay, the rate of H2O2 generation was evaluated in a control (mitochondria treated with NMMA for 30 min) and in GSNO-depleted mitochondria (mitochondria incubated with NMMA at 25°C for 3–4 h until the concentration of GSNO was not detectable by HPLC). No significant difference was found in the rates of H2O2 production between GSNO-depleted and control mitochondria (98 ± 30 and 137 ± 30 μm/min, respectively; mean ± S.E.; n=3), indicating that the decay of GSNO did not contribute significantly to the H2O2 generation by mitochondria; however, it did not precludein vivo situations in which higher concentrations of GSNO may be achieved, and its decay may have a substantial contribution to the rate of H2O2production. We investigated whether the modulation of ROS by NO⋅-producing mitochondria was the result of the interaction between NO⋅ and certain electron carriers of the respiratory chain. This hypothesis is based on the high affinity of NO⋅ for metallo-containing proteins (31Cleeter M.W.J. Cooper J.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Moncada S. Moncada A.H.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar, 32Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) and on the fact that certain inhibitors of the respiratory chain (those that increase the steady-state reduction level of electron carriers at the NADH dehydrogenase and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase segments) enhance the production of ROS. Toward this end, the steady-state reduction of the carriers of the respiratory chain was evaluated in NO⋅-producing mitochondria by visible spectroscopy (Fig. 5). Under these conditions, 77% of cytochromes b and c was reduced, whereas 50% of cytochrome oxidase was reduced. The steady-state reduction of cytochrome oxidase (in percentage) was found within the experimental range of the inhibition of the oxygen consumption under identical conditions. This result agreed with those previously obtained in which changes in the respiratory rates correlated with those in cytochrome oxidase activity under identical conditions of NO⋅production (7Giulivi C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence for the association between the increased reduced state of the respiratory chain carriers and H2O2 production in NO⋅-producing mitochondria was provided by evaluating the steady-state reduction of the respiratory chain carriers and the rate of ROS production under a variety of conditions, including those that entailed changes in NO⋅ production (Fig. 6). A significant correlation was found between the reduction level of cytochrome b (Fig. 6) or other components of the respiratory chain (not shown) and the production of H2O2(Fig. 6) (r = 0.958), indicating that an increased reduction of these carriers under a variety of conditions (including those in which NO⋅ is produced) leads to an increased rate of ROS production. Based on our results, it seemed that the modulation of ROS production was accomplished through the reversible inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory rate by NO⋅ at the cytochrome oxidase level. The transient decrease (or inhibition, depending on the concentration of NO⋅ and oxygen) in the respiratory rate leads to an increased steady-state reduction of the respiratory chain carriers, which in turn by reacting with oxygen resulted in the production of ROS. It is likely that cytochrome oxidase represents the crossover point in NO⋅-producing mitochondria (Fig. 5), excluding a significant interaction of NO⋅ with other available components of the respiratory chain (cytochromes c orb) under these experimental conditions. However, if cytochrome oxidase were the crossover point in this process, it would have been fully reduced. This apparent discrepancy can be bridged by considering that the interaction of NO⋅ with cytochrome oxidase is complex, constituted by the reversible binding of NO⋅ to the heme a3 of cytochrome oxidase and by the reduction of NO⋅ to N2O by this oxidase (7Giulivi C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Considering the results presented in this study, it could be wrongly surmised that the effect of NO⋅ on the respiratory chain is not different from that of other xenobiotics used to enhance ROS production in mitochondria (e.g. NADH-supplemented mitochondria plus rotenone or FADH2-supplemented mitochondria plus antimycin). Nitric oxide has two distinctive properties from the aforementioned inhibitors; it is endogenously produced (4Giulivi C. Proceedings of the 3rd Annual Meeting of The Oxygen Society , Abstr. 33.

This latter property, based on its cytochrome c oxidase-mediated catabolism, allows a slow but continuous flow of electrons through the chain, even when a complete suppression of the O2consumption has been accomplished. This type of modulation of the respiratory chain has the advantage of avoiding a complete reduction of the components of the respiratory chain and the subsequent burst of ROS when lower ratios of [NO⋅]/[O2] are encountered. The mitochondrial production of ROS has been considered as a side process of the normal oxidative metabolism, its rate ranging between two levels determined by the mitochondrial metabolic states, namely States 4 (maximum) and 3 (minimum) (2Boveris A. Oshino N. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). This study demonstrated that the mitochondrial production of ROS is not limited to these two values and may exhibit a degree of values modulated by endogenous NO⋅. Cellular conditions that would affect the availability of either l-Arg or other cofactors required for NOS activity would generate variable amounts of NO⋅and O⨪2. Although further studies need to be performed to fully understand the implications of these observations, two different groups of reports may support the importance of our observations. First, some studies support the important role of manganese superoxide dismutase in a system that produces both O⨪2 and NO⋅ in preventing the formation of the powerful oxidant peroxynitrite and the deleterious effect that the inactivation/lack of this enzyme may cause (20Williams M.D. Van Remmen H. Conrad C.C. Huang T.T. Epstein C.J. Richardson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28510-28515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Second, some studies examine the role of mitochondrial ROS, and that of endogenous agents that modulate their concentrations, as activators of intracellular signaling cascades involved in a variety of responses."

Base loss can occur by spontaneous hydrolysis of the N-glycosylic bond or by the action of DNA glycosylases on damaged bases. It has been estimated that a mammalian cell loses up to 10,000 purines/day from its genome (1Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3610-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, AP sites are efficiently repaired by excision repair processes (2Ramotar D. Popoff S.C. Gralla E.B. Demple B. Mol. Cell.

Thus, to maintain the continuity of DNA during replication, AP sites encountered by the replication machinery have to be bypassed. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genes in the RAD6 epistasis group promote replication through DNA lesions (5Prakash L. Mol. Gen.

The REV1, REV3, andREV7 genes of this epistasis group are essential for damage-induced mutagenesis (8Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Cancer Surv. 1996; 28: 21-31PubMed Google Scholar), including mutagenesis induced by AP sites (3Johnson R.E. Torres-Ramos C.A. Izumi T. Mitra S. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3137-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The Rev1 protein has a deoxycytidyltransferase activity that can incorporate a dCMP residue opposite an abasic site (9Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), and the Rev3 and Rev7 proteins associate to form DNA polymerase ζ (10Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C.

Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The yeast RAD30 gene, which belongs to the RAD6epistasis group, encodes a DNA polymerase, Polη, that has the unique ability to efficiently replicate through a cis-synthymine-thymine (T-T) dimer; it does so correctly by inserting two A residues across from the T-T dimer (11Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 12Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Consistent with the error-free bypass of the T-T dimer, inactivation of yeast and human Polη causes UV hypermutability (7McDonald J.P. Levine A.S. Woodgate R.

Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar), and as a consequence, they suffer from a high incidence of UV-induced skin cancers. In addition to the T-T dimer, yeast and human Polη are able to bypass the 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) lesion efficiently and accurately (18Haracska L., Yu, S.-L. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In contrast to eukaryotic polymerases α, δ, and ε, which preferentially incorporate an A opposite the 8-oxoG lesion, Polη predominantly inserts a C opposite the 8-oxoG lesion (18Haracska L., Yu, S.-L. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Also, yeast and human Polη are able to bypass the O6-methylguanine (m6G) lesion, and they incorporate a C or a T residue opposite this lesion (19Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8001-8007Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For DNA polymerases lacking the proofreading 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity, the fidelity for nucleotide insertion depends upon the requirement of the polymerase active site for correct Watson-Crick base pairing geometry and upon the ability of bases to form proper hydrogen (H) bonding. Most DNA polymerases are highly sensitive to geometric distortions in DNA (20Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), and their fidelity is affected more severely by the disruption of optimal geometry than by H bonding between base pairs (21Moran S. Ren R.X.-F. Kool E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10506-10511Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 22Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10493-10495Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). As a consequence, they are unable to incorporate nucleotides opposite lesions that distort the DNA helix. Previously, we suggested that the ability of Polη to bypass lesions, such as the T-T dimer, 8-oxoG, and m6G, results from an unusual tolerance of its active site for the distorted template geometries of these lesions. To further assess the range of template lesions tolerated by Polη, here we examine the bypass of an abasic site, a prototypical noninstructional lesion. We find that Polη inserts nucleotides opposite the AP site very poorly, and it also extends from the inserted nucleotide very inefficiently. These results suggest that Polη requires the presence of template bases opposite both the incoming nucleotide and the primer terminus to catalyze efficient nucleotide insertion. Standard DNA polymerase reactions (10 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 20 nm 5′32P-labeled oligonucleotide primer annealed to an oligonucleotide template, and dNTP in the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were initiated by adding yeast or human Polη at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. After incubation for 5 min at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 40 μl of loading buffer containing 20 mmEDTA, 95% formamide, 0.3% bromphenol blue, and 0.3% cyanol blue. The reaction products were resolved on 10 or 20% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea and were dried before autoradiography at −70 °C with intensifying screens. A Molecular Dynamics STORM phosphorImager and ImageQuant software were used for quantitation. DNA substrates S-1 and S-2 were generated by annealing the 75-nt oligomer template (N75AP, 5′-AGCTACCATGCCTGCCTCAAGAGTTCGTAA0ATGCCTACACTGGAGTACCGGAGCATCGTCGTGACTGGGAAAAC-3′), which contained an AP site (a tetrahydrofuran moiety; Midland Co.) at the underlined 0at position 31 or a nondamaged G residue at this position, respectively, to the 32-nt 5′ 32P-labeled oligomer primer (N4456, 5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGATGCTCCGGTACTC-3′). For steady-state kinetic analysis, DNA substrates S-3, S-4(G), S-4(A), S-4(T), and S-4(C) were generated by annealing a 52- nt oligomer template (5′-TTCGTATAATGCCTACACT0GAGTACCGGA GCATCGTCGTGACTGGGAAAAC-3′), which contained an AP residue at the underlined position 20 to the 32-nt and four different 33-nt 5′ 32P-labeled oligomer primers (N4456 or oligonucleotides that contain N4456 with one additional G, A, T or C residue at its 3′-end, respectively). DNA substrates S-5(G), S-5(A), S-5(T), and S-5(C) were generated by annealing the N75AP oligomer template to four different 45-nt 5′32P-labeled oligomer primers that contain oligomer N4309 (5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGATGCTCCGGTACTCCAGTGTAGGCAT-3′) with one additional G, A, T, or C residue at its 3′-end. In nondamaged control DNA substrates the complementary bases were used instead of the AP site. The sequence of the DNA substrate containing the 18-nt template oligomer annealed to the 12-nt primer is shown in the figures. Steady-state kinetic analysis for each deoxynucleotide incorporation opposite the AP site was done as described previously (23Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 24Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Analyses of primer extension from this lesion were carried out in a similar manner, except that only the correct incoming deoxynucleotide was added to the reaction and the primer varied at the 3′ primer end. Briefly, Polη was incubated with increasing concentrations of a single deoxynucleotide (0–1000 μm) for 1 min under standard reaction conditions. Gel band intensities of the substrates and products were quantitated by PhosphorImager. The percentage of primer extended was plotted as a function of dNTP concentration, and the data were fit by nonlinear regression using SigmaPlot 5.0 to the Michaelis-Menten equation describing a hyperbola, v = (Vmax × [dNTP]/(Km + [dNTP]). Apparent Km andVmax steady-state parameters were obtained from the best fit. To determine whether yeast Polη replicates past an abasic site in template DNA, we used a running start DNA substrate containing a single AP site in a 75-nt template DNA in which the DNA polymerase must synthesize 12 nt before encountering the lesion. DNA synthesis reactions were carried out in the presence of a 4-fold excess of DNA substrate over Polη and from low to higher dNTP concentrations (0.5–50 μm). yPolη replicated through the AP site very poorly, and even at 50 μm dNTP, only ∼5% translesion synthesis occurred (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5–8) compared with synthesis on a template containing a normal G residue (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–4). Furthermore, yPolη exhibits two strong stall sites, one right before the lesion and the other opposite the lesion, indicating an inhibition of insertion across from the AP site as well as an inhibition of extension from the nucleotide inserted opposite the lesion. A stall site at the position just after the AP site indicates that elongation opposite the 5′ residue next to the AP site is also inhibited. To identify the deoxynucleotide inserted opposite the AP site, we assayed yPolη on an 18-nt template having either a G or an AP site at position 13 from the 3′ end in the template, primed with a 12-nt primer (Fig. 1 B) in the presence of a single or all four nucleotides. As markers, we used the 13- and 18-nt oligomers representing a primer extended by one nucleotide and full-length products, respectively, and containing a C, A, T, or G residue at position 13, which can be distinguished by their relative electrophoretic mobility on 20% polyacrylamide gels (Fig.1 B, lanes 1–4). To facilitate bypass, we used high yPolη as well as high dNTP concentrations, which on the undamaged G template resulted in 100% synthesis to the end of the template DNA (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). Even under these forcing conditions, yPolη carried out almost no AP bypass, and only nucleotide incorporation opposite the AP site without further extension was observed (Fig. 1 B, lane 6). In the presence of all four dNTPs, yPolη inserted primarily a G residue (95%) across from the AP site (Fig. 1 B, lane 6). With only a single nucleotide present besides a G residue, yPolη also incorporated an A, and T was inserted very weakly opposite the AP site (Fig. 1 B, lanes 7–10). Next we measured the kinetics of nucleotide insertion and extension during DNA synthesis past the AP site. To determine the frequency of nucleotide incorporation by yPolη, we measured the Km andVmax steady-state kinetic parameters (23Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 24Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 25Mendelman L.V. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2338-2346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for all four incoming dNTPs opposite a template AP site. For purposes of comparison, the kinetic parameters opposite nondamaged template residues were measured as well. yPolη was incubated with the DNA substrate and with increasing concentrations of one of the four deoxynucleotides. The pattern of deoxynucleotide incorporation by yPolη opposite an AP site is shown in Fig.2 A. The Kmand Vmax parameters were determined and used to calculate the percentage of each nucleotide incorporated opposite the AP site (Table I). yPolη incorporated 59% G, 31% A, 7% T, and 3% C opposite the AP site. This analysis indicates that yPolη incorporates a G opposite the AP site with a 2-fold higher efficiency than A. Importantly, however, yPolη inserts a G opposite the AP site about 1,000-fold less efficiently than the insertion of G opposite C (Table I). The other nucleotides were inserted even less efficiently (Table I). The substantially lower efficiency of nucleotide incorporation opposite an AP site relative to a nondamaged template residue results from a 1,000–10,000-fold increase in the Km for dNTP (Table I).Table IKinetic parameters of insertion reactions catalyzed by yeast PolηSitedNTP addedKmVmaxVmax/KmInsertion 1-aCalculated by dividing the efficiency (Vmax/Km) of insertion for each dNTP by the sum of the insertion efficiencies of all four dNTPs.Relative efficiency 1-bCompares the efficiency of dNTP insertion opposite the template AP site to the efficiency of dNTP insertion opposite the complementary template base.μm%/min%Insertion opposite abasic site1-c0indicates an AP site.5′- - - -CTCdGTP51 ± 4.126 ± 1.80.51591 /878- - - - -GAG0T- -5′- - - -CTCdATP77 ± 4.521 ± 0.80.27311 /1988- - - - -GAG0T- -5′- - - -CTCdTTP194 ± 3712 ± 1.10.06271 /12790- - - - -GAG0T- -5′- - - -CTCdCTP248 ± 227.3 ± 0.80.02931 /66931- - - - -GAG0T- -Insertion opposite nondamaged site5′- - - -CTCdGTP0.058 ± 0.0226 ± 2.4448- - - - -GAGCT- -5′- - - -CTCdATP0.067 ± 0.0136 ± 1.8537- - - - -GAGTT- -5′- - - -CTCdTTP0.029 ± 0.0123 ± 1.5793- - - - -GAGAT- -5′- - - -CTCdCTP0.017 ± 0.00533 ± 1.91941- - - - -GAGGT- -1-a Calculated by dividing the efficiency (Vmax/Km) of insertion for each dNTP by the sum of the insertion efficiencies of all four dNTPs.1-b Compares the efficiency of dNTP insertion opposite the template AP site to the efficiency of dNTP insertion opposite the complementary template base.1-c 0indicates an AP site. Open table in a new tab For lesion bypass to occur, it is important that, after incorporating a nucleotide opposite the lesion, a polymerase extend the primer beyond the lesion. To examine the efficiency of extension past the AP site, the steady-state kinetic parameters of the addition of the next correct deoxynucleotide by yPolη on substrates in which the 3′ terminus of the primer is paired with an AP site were measured. Fig. 2 Bpresents the pattern of extension from G, A, T, or C when paired with an AP site. From the pattern of extension from these different 3′ termini, the Km and Vmaxparameters were obtained and used to calculate the efficiency (Vmax/Km) of extension. The ratio of extension opposite from the AP site was: G:A:T:C = 49:37:9:5 (Table II), which indicates that yPolη extends from a G or an A opposite the AP site about equally well. yPolη, however, extends from G or A quite inefficiently, as the efficiency (Vmax/Km) of extension in both cases was reduced by almost 1000-fold that from the opposite nondamaged complementary bases (Table II). The lower efficiency of extension from bases opposite an AP site relative to the extension from bases opposite a nondamaged residue was also because of a 500–2000-fold increase in the Km for dNTP (TableII). Hence, yPolη is very inefficient in inserting nucleotides across from an AP site as well as in extending from the nucleotide inserted.Table IIKinetic parameters of extension reactions catalyzed by yeast PolηSitedNTP addedKmVmaxVmax/KmExtension 2-aCalculated by dividing the efficiency (Vmax/Km) of each extension by the sum of the efficiencies of all four extensions.Relative efficiency 2-bCompares the efficiency of extension from a nucleotide placed opposite the template AP site to the efficiency of extension from the nucleotide opposite from the complementary template base.μm%/min%Extension from G, A, T, or C opposite abasic site2-c0indicates an AP site.5′- - - -TCGdATP85 ± 7.411 ± 0.60.129491 /906- - - - -AG0TC- -5′- - - -TCAdATP114 ± 2111 ± 1.60.096371 /885- - - - -AG0TC- -5′- - - -TCTdATP182 ± 374.5 ± 1.10.02591 /3480- - - - -AG0TC- -5′- - - -TCCdATP257 ± 463.3 ± 0.80.01351 /9769- - - - -AG0TC- -Extension from G, A, T, or C opposite nondamaged site5′- - - -TCGdATP0.18 ± 0.0421 ± 2.4117- - - - -AGCTC- - -5′- - - -TCAdATP0.21 ± 0.0218 ± 0.5385- - - - -AGTTC- -5′- - - -TCTdATP0.24 ± 0.0221 ± 2.687- - - - -AGATC- -5′- - - -TCCdATP0.15 ± 0.0419 ± 1.1127- - - - -AGGTC- -2-a Calculated by dividing the efficiency (Vmax/Km) of each extension by the sum of the efficiencies of all four extensions.2-b Compares the efficiency of extension from a nucleotide placed opposite the template AP site to the efficiency of extension from the nucleotide opposite from the complementary template base.2-c 0indicates an AP site. Open table in a new tab We also examined the ability of the human DNA polymerase η (hPolη) to bypass the AP site. Like yPolη, hPolη bypasses the AP site very inefficiently. hPolη also exhibits two stall sites, one right before the AP site and the other opposite the lesion, indicating that there is inhibition of deoxynucleotide insertion opposite the AP site as well as inhibition of extension from this lesion (data not shown). The extremely restricted ability of hPolη to bypass an AP site is further reflected in its steady-state Km andVmax kinetic values. The kinetics of insertion of a single deoxynucleotide opposite an AP site and the kinetics of addition of the next correct nucleotide to various 3′-primer termini situated across from the AP site were determined as a function of deoxynucleotide concentration. hPolη also inserts a G somewhat better than an A opposite the AP site. However, hPolη inserts these nucleotides opposite the AP site ∼103-fold less efficiently than opposite the nondamaged complementary base, because of a 600–2,500-fold increase in the Km for dNTP (TableIII). The order and the ratio of deoxynucleotide insertion opposite the AP site by hPolη were G:A:C:T ∼ 13:10:1.5:1 (Table III). hPolη also extends inefficiently from the nucleotide inserted opposite the AP site, and the order and the frequency of extension from different 3′-terminal deoxynucleotides paired with the AP site were A:G:C:T ∼ 5:2:2:1 (Table IV). Thus, human Polη inserts G slightly better than A opposite the AP site, but it is 2.5-fold more efficient at extending from an A opposite the AP site than from a G opposite this lesion. The poor extension efficiency of hPolη is again because of a 500–1500-fold increase in the Km for dNTP (Table IV).Table IIIKinetic parameters of insertion reactions catalyzed by human PolηSitedNTP addedKmVmaxVmax/KmInsertion 3-aCalculated by dividing the efficiency (Vmax/Km) of insertion for each dNTP by the sum of the insertion efficiencies of all four dNTPs.Relative efficiency3-bCompares the efficiency of dNTP insertion opposite the template AP site to the efficiency of dNTP insertion opposite the complementary template base.μm%/min%Insertion opposite abasic site3-c0indicates an AP site.5′- - - -CTCdGTP33 ± 6.719 ± 10.54511 /825- - - - -GAG0T- -5′- - - -CTCdATP39 ± 4.516 ± 1.30.41391 /1414- - - - -GAG0T- -5′- - - -CTCdTTP253 ± 2311 ± 0.80.04341 /3953- - - - -GAG0T- -5′- - - -CTCdCTP106 ± 126.3 ± 1.60.05961 /4338- - - - -GAG0T- -Insertion opposite nondamaged site5′- - - -CTCdGTP0.056 ± 0.00825 ± 2.15446- - - - -GAGCT- -5′- - - -CTCdATP0.062 ± 0.00736 ± 0.53580- - - - -GAGTT- -5′- - - -CTCdTTP0.1 ± 0.0217 ± 1.6170- - - - -GAGAT- -5′- - - -CTCdCTP0.082 ± 0.00321 ± 0.8256- - - - -GAGGT- -3-a Calculated by dividing the efficiency (Vmax/Km) of insertion for each dNTP by the sum of the insertion efficiencies of all four dNTPs.3-b Compares the efficiency of dNTP insertion opposite the template AP site to the efficiency of dNTP insertion opposite the complementary template base.3-c 0indicates an AP site.

Both yeast and human Polη incorporate As opposite the two Ts of the T-T dimer with the same efficiency and accuracy as opposite undamaged Ts (12Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3094-3099PubMed Google Scholar, 13Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7447-7450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In contrast with eukaryotic replicative polymerases α, δ, and ε, which all bypass 8-oxoG by incorporating an A opposite the lesion, Polη bypasses 8-oxoG by inserting predominantly a C opposite the lesion (18Haracska L., Yu, S.-L. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These and other observations (19Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8001-8007Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) have suggested that Polη is refractory to geometric distortions conferred upon DNA by these lesions. Here we examine the ability of Polη to bypass an AP site. An abasic site is a prototypical noninstructional DNA lesion. NMR studies have indicated that DNA containing an A opposite the AP site retains all aspects of B-form DNA, and the unpaired A and the abasic residue lie inside the helix (33Cuniasse P. Sowers L.C.

Biol. 1990; 213: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The A is held well in the helix as if paired with T, and the melting temperature of the A· AP site is the same as that of the A·T base pair (33Cuniasse P. Sowers L.C. Eritja R. Kaplan B. Goodman M.F.

Biol. 1990; 213: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). At low temperatures, a G opposite the AP site is also predominantly intrahelical (35Cuniasse P. Fazakerley G.V. Guschlbauer W. Kaplan B.E. Sowers L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, when a pyrimidine is positioned opposite the AP site, both the pyrimidine and the abasic sugar are extrahelical, and the helix collapses (35Cuniasse P. Fazakerley G.V. Guschlbauer W. Kaplan B.E. Sowers L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Many DNA polymerases insert an A opposite the AP site (36Strauss B.S. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), presumably because the geometry of an A opposite an AP site closely resembles an A·T base pair. As revealed from steady-state kinetic analyses of nucleotide insertion and extension, both yeast and human Polη incorporate nucleotides opposite the AP site very inefficiently, and they are also highly inefficient in subsequent extension of the primer. This suggests that Polη requires the presence of template bases opposite both the incoming nucleotide and the primer terminus to catalyze efficient nucleotide incorporation. In the absence of either of these template bases, either the enzyme or the enzyme-bound DNA substrate may adopt a conformation that is not conducive to nucleotide incorporation. Such a conformational alteration could then result in weaker dNTP binding to the enzyme-DNA complex resulting in the substantial increase in theKm for dNTP observed in both the incorporation opposite an AP site and the extension from bases opposite the AP site. Although the results reported here provide no compelling evidence for a role of Polη in AP bypass, they do not exclude the possibility that association with accessory factors modifies the damage bypass ability of this polymerase. In Escherichia coli, RecA stimulates the DNA synthesis efficiency of the UmuCD′ complex (PolV) 15,000-fold, and the increased efficiency is reflected mainly in theKm reduction for dNTPs (37Tang M. Pham P. Shen X. Taylor J.-S. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2000; 404: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). By reducing theKm for dNTPs, accessory factors may facilitate AP bypass by promoting nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion by Polη."

By using this approach, we have found that a three-amino acid stretch within the transmembrane domain is necessary and sufficient to confer specificity of control of activation kinetics by KCNE1 and KCNE3.

Tapper and George (16Tapper A.R. George A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), using KCNE1 deletions and chimeras with a sodium channel β-subunit, showed that the KCNE1 C terminus alone cannot modify the KvLQT1 channel but rather that the presence of the KCNE1 transmembrane domain is also needed for this function. Recently, a novel KCNE family member, KCNE3, was shown to interact with KvLQT1 to produce a potassium current with a constitutive component (2Schroeder B.C. Waldegger S. Fehr S. Bleich M. Warth R. Greger R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). This current resembles that seen in colonic epithelia, where both KCNE3 and KvLQT1 are expressed. Here we have exploited the marked differences in the regulation of KvLQT1 by these two proteins to investigate which regions of these two proteins mediate the differences in effects on KvLQT1. The approach of KCNE1/KCNE3 chimeras has the advantage of placing structural portions of KCNE1 in a homologous environment, but one that can modulate KvLQT1 function quite differently from KCNE1. By using this approach, we find that a three-amino acid segment within the transmembrane domain of KCNE1 is sufficient and necessary to determine the specificity of KCNE control of channel activation. Additionally, our results show a physical separation of determinants of activation and deactivation. We detected human ESTs with homology to KCNE1 via TBLASTN search. By overlapping the ESTs we constructed the full-length cDNA. Forward and reverse primers from the 5′- and 3′-ends of the predicted coding region (5′-ATGGAGACTACCAATGGAACGGAG and 3′-TTAGATCATAGACACACGGTTCTT) were used in 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR using the Marathon Ready cDNA kit (CLONTECH) and human stomach cDNA. Several rapid amplifications of cDNA end clones were sequenced and assembled to get the full-length cDNA. The sequence has been reported to GenBankTM under accession number AF302494. Chimeras were constructed using a PCR-based approach. Briefly, using PCR withPfu turbo (Stratagene) and 5′-phosphorylated primers, we produced blunt-ended PCR fragments that corresponded to the regions of interest from KCNE1 and KCNE3. Blunt-ended fragments from KCNE1 were gel-purified, ligated overnight to a blunt-ended PCR product corresponding to the appropriate region of KCNE3, and re-amplified by PCR for subcloning into PCR Blunt II TOPO (Invitrogen). Chimera cDNAs were digested using HindIII and EcoRI and ligated into the mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Nomenclature of the primers and chimeras corresponds to the order of fragments (M is minK (KCNE1) and K is KCNE3), followed by the splice site in human KCNE1 when the sequences are aligned as shown in Fig. 1 b. Thus, a chimera corresponding to the N-terminal 47 residues of KCNE1 followed by KCNE3 residues for the remainder of the protein is named M(1–47)K. All primers used are in Fig. 1 a. Primers below the shaded gray line are complementary to fragments of both KCNE1 and KCNE3 and were used to generate swaps of short (<7) amino acids.

Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15069) Google Scholar). An Axopatch 1D patch clamp amplifier was used, and protocols were controlled via PC using pCLAMP8. Data were filtered using an 8-pole Bessel filter at 1 kHz and sampled at 4 kHz. For the protocol in Fig.3 c, lower trace, sampling was at 40 kHz. Activation curves are derived from tail currents at 0 mV following a series of 2 s. depolarizations and fitted to a Boltzmann curve using the equation, I = 1/(1 + exp((Vh − V)/k)), where I is the measured tail current; V is the applied membrane voltage; Vh is the voltage at half-maximal activation; and k is the slope factor. Whole cell current amplitudes were compared daily to a KCNE1/KvLQT1 control and normalized to this value to control for variations in transfection efficiency. Fig.2 shows whole cell current recordings from CHO cells transfected with KvLQT1 cDNA alone or in combination with either KCNE3 or KCNE1. As previously reported, coexpression with KCNE1 results in an increase in whole cell current amplitude (2.2-fold, see Table I) and the kinetics of both activation and deactivation are slowed (Fig. 2, a andb, and Table I) (4Barhanin J.

Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Coexpression of KCNE3/KvLQT1, as previously reported (2Schroeder B.C. Waldegger S. Fehr S. Bleich M. Warth R. Greger R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), resulted in a current with a constitutively active component (Fig. 2 c), as viewed on faster time scales and hyperpolarizations to −150 mV (Fig. 2 c, inset). We also observed a distinct time voltage-dependent component of activation and deactivation for the KvLQT1/KCNE3 current (Fig. 2,c, e, and f). The voltage-dependent component had altered activation (KvLQT1, 24.2 ± 2.3 ms, and KCNE3, 21.1 ± 1.9 ms) and deactivation kinetics (KvLQT1, 39 ± 1.1 ms, and KCNE3, 16 ± 2.1 ms) with a shift inVh (KvLQT1, −15.2 ± 0.52 mV, and KCNE3, 52.2 ± 2.15 mV), and lacked obvious voltage-dependent inactivation (Fig. 2 c), indicating that it too was a consequence of the association of KvLQT1 with KCNE3. Whole cell current amplitudes were also augmented relative to KvLQT1 alone, to a similar extent as KCNE1 (KCNE1, 2.13 ± 0.14-fold, and KCNE3, 2.22 ± 0.09-fold, relative to KvLQT1, 1.00). Expression of KCNE3 alone did not yield currents (Fig. 2 d).Table IQuantitative analysis of currents from KCNE1/KCNE3 chimerasChannelRelative currentRise timeτdeactVhSlope factornConstitutive componentkvlqt alone1.0024.2 ± 2.339 ± 1.1−15.2 ± 0.5213.1 ± 0.558NDminK2.13 ± 0.14704 ± 27.5146 ± 13.530.5 ± 1.6520.1 ± 1.120NDKCNE32.22 ± 0.0921.1 ± 1.916 ± 2.152.2 ± 3.9736.2 ± 1.590.30 ± 0.03N termini swappedK(1–47)M1.587 ± 0.12442 ± 15203 ± 187.16 ± 5.4327 ± 1.7310NDM(1–47)K0.23 ± 0.0627 ± 1.647 ± 6.633.0 ± 10.245 ± 7.350.18 ± 0.08C termini swappedK(1–63)M2.30 ± 0.1614.3 ± 0.58618.3 ± 3.4340.7 ± 4.8240.5 ± 1.33100.24 ± 0.07M(1–63)K0.48 ± 0.04591 ± 70112 ± 5.567.8 ± 12.611.4 ± 5.97NDInterposed segmentsKM(48–63)K2.09 ± 0.07825 ± 81.8182 ± 15.513.0 ± 3.6524.5 ± 2.75NDKM(48–59)K2.83 ± 0.176.91 ± 34.9116 ± 10.649.2 ± 2.5918.2 ± 1.110NDKM(57–59)K0.86 ± 0.13633 ± 26.239 ± 1.0260.8 ± 1.5218.1 ± 1.89NDKM(48–56)K2.52 ± 0.4342.5 ± 3.2228.5 ± 3.5Not measuredNot measured80.75 ± 0.17MK(48–59)M1.13 ± 0.1544 ± 2.524 ± 1.442.4 ± 2.5630.2 ± 1.850.12 ± 0.07MK(57–59)M0.30 ± 0.0781 ± 3.13123 ± 4.775.0 ± 9.932.4 ± 4.350.17 ± 0.03MK(57–63)M0.28 ± 0.3557.2 ± 1.4817 ± 3.210.4 ± 2.133.1 ± 2.380.18 ± 0.02Vh, k, and current magnitudes were derived as described under “Materials and Methods.” Activation rise time was determined as the time to ½ max following an 80 mV depolarization.

Open table in a new tab Vh, k, and current magnitudes were derived as described under “Materials and Methods.” Activation rise time was determined as the time to ½ max following an 80 mV depolarization. Deactivation time constant was measured by fitting current at −120 mV following depolarization using a single exponential. The ratio of constitutive component to total current was determined by taking the height of the instantaneous rise in current following depolarization to 100 mV to the total steady-state current after voltage-activated current had reached a plateau. To determine the regions of KCNE1 and KCNE3 that are responsible for the different effects on KvLQT1 function, we swapped various segments of each to produce recombinant chimera cDNAs. We then coexpressed the chimerical cDNA with KvLQT1 for functional analysis of the resulting currents. Fig.3, a and b, shows the results of swapping the N-terminal 46 residues of KCNE1 with the corresponding segment of KCNE3, a stretch encompassing the extracellular domain as well as four residues of the outer transmembrane domain. Kinetics of both activation and deactivation of chimeras K(1–47)M and M(1–47)K (rise times: K(1–47)M, 442 ± 15 ms, and M(1–47)K, 27 ± 1.6 ms) resemble KCNE1 and KCNE3, respectively (rise times: 704 ± 27.5 and 21.1 ± 1.9 ms, see also Fig. 3, a and b, and Fig. 5). Chimeras that exchanged the intracellular domains plus 4 amino acids of the transmembrane domain, M(1–63)K (rise time: 591 ± 70 ms) and K(1–63)M (rise time: 14.3 ± 0.6 ms), resembled KCNE3 and KCNE1, respectively (Fig. 3, c and d, and Fig. 5). These chimeras thus define the transmembrane region of KCNE1 from Val-48 to Leu-63 (corresponding to KCNE3 residues Leu-62 to Leu-77) that appears to mediate the specific effects of these proteins, a hypothesis that we confirmed with chimera KM(48–63)K (Table I and Figs.3 e and 5). To examine the transmembrane region in finer detail, we subdivided it by constructing chimeras KM(48–56)K that had a clear constitutive component present and activated with a rise time of 42.5 ± 3.2 ms (Fig.4 c), and KM(48–59)K (Fig.4 a) which, like KCNE1, showed no constitutive component and slow activation (rise time 691 ± 34.9 ms). These chimeras showed that activation kinetics follow amino acids 57–59 in the KCNE1 transmembrane domain (KCNE3 amino acids 71–73). This result indicated that a region of only three residues was potentially responsible for the activation differences seen in KvLQT1-KCNE1 complexes. We confirmed this hypothesis by constructing three amino acid-swapped chimeras KM(57–59)K and MK(57–59)M. As seen in Fig. 4, d ande, and Fig. 5, kinetics of activation of KM(57–59)K (rise time: 633 ± 26.2 ms), a chimera with 3 KCNE1 amino acids inserted into KCNE3, approximate those of KCNE1. Activation kinetics of MK(57–59)M (rise time: 65 ± 6.4 ms), in turn, resemble those of KCNE3. A constitutively active current was detected for MK(57–59)M; however, it composed a smaller fraction of the total than that seen with wild-type KCNE3 (Table I), indicating that additional residues outside this region may be involved in generating the constitutive component. In contrast to currents seen with KCNE1 or other Iks-like chimeras (Table I and Figs. 5 and6 b), the kinetics of deactivation of KM(57–59)K are greatly accelerated (39 ± 1.0 msversus 146 ± 13.5 ms for KvLQT1/KCNE1 currents). The voltage-dependent current of chimera MK(57–59)M shows activation kinetics that are somewhat slower than the KCNE3 voltage-dependent current alone (MK(57–59)M, 65 ± 6.4 ms, KCNE3, 21.1 ± 1.9 ms, and Fig. 6 a) but nonetheless are ∼9-fold faster than the rise time of KvLQT1/KCNE1(704 ± 27.5 ms). Deactivation kinetics with this chimera (123 ± 4.8 ms) are nearly as slow as that of KCNE1 (146 ± 13.5 ms), however. Comparison of deactivation rates for chimeras KM(48–59)K and KM(57–59)K implicates a role for KCNE1 residues 48–56, lying N-terminal to this stretch, in determining the slow kinetics of deactivation seen with Iks. In contrast, incorporation of KCNE3 residues either N-terminal (MK(48–59)M) or C-terminal (MK(57–63)M) to this stretch resulted in fast kinetics of deactivation, similar to KCNE3 (Table I). A possible explanation is that residues 48–56 of KCNE1 confer slow deactivation, whereas in KCNE3, C-terminal residues (60) control fast deactivation. When both segments are present in the same protein, however, the KCNE3 residues may act in a dominant fashion, but only when residues 57–59 are present as well (compare KM(48–56)K and MK(57–63)M, Table I). We determined the presence of a constitutively active component to KCNE3 currents by looking for the appearance of an instantaneous current following depolarization, manifested as sharp corner before the onset of voltage-activated current (see Figs. 2 c, 3, and 4). From the height of this step we estimated the fraction of total current that was attributable to the constitutive component (Table I, last column). The presence of constitutively active current was also seen using very fast sampling rates and membrane hyperpolarizations to eliminate the possibility of a very fast-activating voltage-dependent current (Figs. 2 c and 4 e). All chimeras containing KCNE3 amino acids 71–73 exhibited such a current. In contrast, chimera KM(57–59)K which consists essentially of KCNE3 with amino acids 71–73 replaced with KCNE1 residues 57–59 does not exhibit any observable constitutive component to its current, demonstrating that these residues are necessary for generating the constitutive component (Fig. 4, d and e) The fraction of total current provided by this constitutive component, however (0.18 ± 0.03), was smaller for chimeras containing these and surrounding residues than for KCNE3 (constitutive component is 0.302 ± 0.03 of total current). Thus, although residues 71–73 are necessary for constitutive activation, they are not sufficient for its full expression. Our results suggest that full control of the constitutively active component may be more complex than kinetics of voltage activation. Interestingly, Cd2+ treatment of a T59C KCNE1 mutant (T58 in human KCNE1) leads to currents with a constitutively active component (14Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The equivalent residue of KCNE3 is a valine, a substitution that like T59C abolishes the hydrogen bonding potential of the threonine hydroxyl group and introduces a larger residue in its place. Our work has determined that small regions within the transmembrane domain of KCNE family members control the activation and deactivation rates of KvLQT1. Specifically, a three-mino acid stretch is sufficient and necessary to confer specificity of activation kinetics to KvLQT1, but neighboring regions appear to control the rates of deactivation. These same three amino acids also appear sufficient and necessary for at least partial generation of the constitutive component of current seen with KCNE3/KvLQT1 complexes. Several groups have provided evidence that the KCNE1 C terminus is a region critical for its function (12Takumi T. Moriyoshi K. Aramori I. Ishii T. Oiki S. Okada Y. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1998; 112: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Most recently, Tapper and George (16Tapper A.R. George A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have shown that the C-terminal domain alone is not sufficient for slow activation when placed in a chimera with a sodium channel β-subunit and that the C-terminal half of the transmembrane domain was also necessary. Our work defines that portion of the transmembrane domain that is sufficient and necessary to confer functional specificity to KCNE1 and -3. Our results do not, however, rule out a role for the C terminus in KCNE1 function. The greatest homology between KCNE1 and KCNE3 resides in the previously determined critical C-terminal amino acids (Fig. 1). This region may be needed for anchoring, binding, or positioning the transmembrane domain that we now identify as the effector. This would explain the results of earlier mutagenesis studies that showed the C-terminal region to be relatively intolerant to amino acid substitutions, as well as an analysis of KvLQT1 mutations that affect KvLQT1 function only in association with KCNE1 (22Chouabe C.N.N. Richard P. Denjoy I. Hainque B. Romey G. Drici M.D. Guicheney P. Barhanin J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Our results indicate a separation of structural determinants of activation and deactivation kinetics. Thermodynamics can help elucidate the mechanism of KCNE control of channel activity by relating experimentally determined rates to energy states of the channel as it opens and closes. Changes in the voltage dependence of activation (Vh) are indicators of changes in the relative free energy of the closed and open states of the channel (ΔGindicates change in Gibbs' free energy). Rates of opening and closing of K channels, in contrast, reflect changes in the activation energy (ΔG ‡). This is the energy required to reach the transition state, the least stable intermediate conformation along the reaction coordinate of a molecule undergoing a physical change. KCNE1 and KCNE3 affect the rates of both opening and closing of the channel and the voltage dependence of activation. Our results provide a physical basis for each of these effects. That we observed nearly identical kinetics of activation between KCNE1 and chimera KM(57–59)K suggests that this region is necessary and sufficient to modulate the slow gating of activation seen with KvLQT1-KCNE1 complexes. We observed a ∼30-mV difference in theVh between the two, however. This result indicates that the substitution of the KCNE1 residues 57–59 in KCNE3 was able to confer the KCNE1-like kinetics of activation of KvLQT1 (by increasing ΔG ‡) independently of theVh (ΔG). The implication therefore is that KCNE1 residues 57–59 interact with the transition state of the channel during the closed → open transition but do so somewhat independently of the relative free energy of the closed and open states (ΔG). In addition, our results have dissected the region of KCNE1 controlling activation rate from that controlling deactivation rate. This result is not consistent with a view of KCNE1 acting simply as an “enzyme,” modulating the activation energy of a reversible reaction. If that were true, we would expect the regions controlling activation and inactivation to be identical. Our observations imply that KCNE1 modulates the kinetics of KvLQT1 by interacting with different transition states during activation (the closed → open transition) and deactivation (the open → closed transition). While such a scenario is impossible in simple chemical equilibria, in the case of voltage-gated ion channels the two transitions take place under conditions of different electric field across the membrane. Channel structure is expected to be different during activation (depolarization) and deactivation (repolarization). Thus, the transition states for each process are also expected to be different. Our data are consistent with a model in which the conformation of KvLQT1, when altered by the change in voltage across the membrane, presents different regions of the channel for interaction with KCNE1 and KCNE3. Following a depolarization, it appears that KCNE1 residues 57–59 (KCNE3 residues 71–73) are available to interact with a transition state to modulate the activation kinetics. Upon repolarization, the different conformations of KvLQT1 and KCNE1/3 allow other neighboring transmembrane regions of the proteins to interact. This interaction then modulates the stability of the reverse transition state (ΔG ‡rev). Our study has thus elucidated structural components of KCNE1 and KCNE3 that are necessary and sufficient to modulate the gating kinetics of KvLQT1 by interacting with several transition states. The technique of perturbing specific structural components by moving them into a homologous environment can serve to complement results from gating charge (23Seoh S.A. Sigg D. Papazian D.M.

However, deletion of the C-terminal RING domains of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 restored antiapoptotic activity, indicating that this region negatively regulates the antiapoptotic function of the N-terminal BIR domain. This finding is consistent with the observation by others that the spacer region and RING domain of c-IAP1 functions as an E3 ligase, promoting autoubiquitination and degradation of c-IAP1. In addition, we found that c-IAP1 is cleaved during apoptosis to 52- and 35-kDa fragments. Both fragments contain the C-terminal end of c-IAP1 including the RING finger. In vitro cleavage of c-IAP1 with apoptotic cell extracts or with purified recombinant caspase-3 produced similar fragments. Furthermore, transfection of cells with the spacer-RING domain alone suppressed the antiapoptotic function of the N-terminal BIR domain of c-IAP1 and induced apoptosis. Optimal death-inducing activity of the spacer-RING required both the spacer region and the zinc-binding RING domain of c-IAP1 but did not require the caspase recruitment domain located within the spacer region.

D-IAP1 was consistently retrieved in a genetic screen for caspase inhibitors (11Hawkins C.J. Wang S.L. Hay B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2885-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and both D-IAP1 and D-IAP2 overexpression inhibits apoptosis in the Drosophila retina (12Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Human c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 are less potent inhibitors of apoptosis compared with XIAP, correlating with the observation that XIAP is a more potent caspase inhibitor (∼100-fold) than c-IAP1 or c-IAP2in vitro (3Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). Both biochemical and structural data support a model where the individual BIR motifs of XIAP are specific inhibitors of different caspases. That is, the second BIR motif (BIR-2) and adjacent sequences of XIAP interact directly with activated caspase-3 and are sufficient to inhibit caspase-3 (13Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P.

However, NMR structure analysis predicts that the mechanism of caspase inhibition by BIR-3 will be distinct from that of BIR-2 (15Sun C. Cai M. Meadows R.P. Xu N. Gunasekera A.H. Herrmann J. Wu J.C.

(1999) EMBO J. 5242–5251.Google Scholar). The role of the C-terminal RING finger seems to be cell type- and/or death stimulus-dependent. In some situations the RING is required for antiapoptotic activity, but in others the RING inhibits the antiapoptotic function of IAP proteins. Although the RING finger of Op-IAP is required for protection of insect cells from apoptosis induced by actinomycin D treatment or baculovirus infection, this domain is not required for inhibition of Hid-induced apoptosis in the same insect cell line (16Clem R.J.

Partial inhibition of cell death induced by HID as well as Reaper and Grim is conferred by BIR-2 of Op-IAP (most equivalent to BIR-3 of c-IAP1) plus a critical carboxyl-proximal flanking sequence. However, BIR-2 plus the RING finger is a more potent protector than BIR-2 (with proximal sequences) alone, implying that the RING finger contributes to the antiapoptotic function of Op-IAP (19Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33915-33921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The RING fingers of a number of proteins including c-IAP1 and XIAP were recently shown to function as E3 ubiquitin ligases in proteosome-dependent protein degradation (20Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). This activity may predominantly facilitate self-destruction as shown for c-IAP1 and XIAP, resulting in cell death. Alternatively, the antiapoptotic function of IAP proteins may be explained by ubiquitination and degradation of caspases as suggested for the RING finger of c-IAP2 (21Huang H. Joazeiro C.A.P. Bonfoco E. Kamada S. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26661-26664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RING finger domains of XIAP, D-IAP1, and D-IAP2 also were shown to interact with signaling factors for the bone morphogenetic protein kinase receptors and may participate in these signal transduction pathways as well (22Yamaguchi K. Nagai S. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nishita M. Tamai K. Irie K. Ueno N. Nishida E. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Earlier work in mammalian cells had suggested that the RING finger of full-length c-IAP1 does not interfere with its antiapoptotic activity in mammalian cells. That is, in a variety of stably or transiently transfected cells, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 were reported to inhibit apoptosis induced by different death stimuli including serum withdrawal, menadione, staurosporine, caspase-1, Bak, or K+depolarization (23Liston P. Roy N. Tamai K. Lefebvre C. Baird S. Cherton-Horvat G. Farahani R. McLean M. Ikeda J.-E. MacKenzie A. Korneluk R.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 24Uren A.G.

Robertson G.S. Weller M. Schulz J.B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In contrast to these reports using mammalian cells, full-length human c-IAP1 failed to inhibit Reaper-induced cell death in a Drosophila eye model unless the RING finger was deleted (12Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Thus, in insect cells, the RING finger appears to negatively regulate the antiapoptotic function of human c-IAP1. Consistent with this finding, expression of the spacer-RING region of D-IAP1 in transgenic flies resulted in a small eye phenotype caused by excessive cell death in the eye disc. Furthermore, the RING finger regions of baculovirus Cp-IAP and Drosophila D-IAP1 can induce apoptosis in the lepidopteran cell line SF-21 (17Harvey A.J. Soliman H. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We found that like the Drosophila system, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 failed to protect mammalian cells unless the RING finger domain was deleted. Furthermore, c-IAP1 was cleaved during apoptosis to release the C-terminal spacer-RING domain that was capable of killing cells in transient transfections. The human IAPs were identified in an expressed sequence tag data base (Human Genome Sciences) by searching with a BLAST program for homology to baculovirus IAP. Expressed sequence tag clones were used as probes to identify full-length cDNAs from the libraries that contained the expressed sequence tag of interest. These clones were essentially identical to previously published c-IAP1 and c-IAP2. C-terminal truncations were generated by insertion of oligonucleotides containing stop codons in all three reading frames into restriction sites at the codon positions indicated in Fig. 2. The CARD1 deletion mutant lacks an internal MunI restriction fragment. The RING mutant was generated by recombinant polymerase chain reaction mutating Cys586, His588, and Cys592 to alanines. ΔBIR-1 initiates at a naturally occurring Met at position 131. IAPs and derivatives were cloned into the BstEII site of the Sindbis virus vector (dsTE12Q), and recombinant viruses were generated as previously reported (27Cheng E.H.Y. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 28Hardwick J.M. Levine B.

C-terminal c-IAP1 fragments and HA-tagged fragments of c-IAP1 were generated by polymerase chain reaction and expressed from a modified pSG5 vector for expression in transfected cells. All clones were verified by DNA sequencing. Mycoplasma-free BHK and CHO cells were plated at 1 × 104 or 2.5 × 105 cells/well in a 24- or 6-well dish, respectively, and infected the following day with recombinant Sindbis viruses at a multiplicity of 10 plaque forming units/per cell. Cell viability was determined at ∼30 h postinfection by trypan blue exclusion which was previously shown to accurately reflect the apoptotic death induced by Sindbis virus (27Cheng E.H.Y. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 30Levine B. Huang Q. Isaacs J.T. Reed J.C. Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Transfected CHO (10 μl LipofectAMINE; Life Technologies, Inc.), BHK (10 μl of LipofectAMINE), 293 (10 μl of GenePorter; Gene Therapy Systems), MCF-7 (10 μl of LipofectAMINE), and Rat-1 (2.5 μl of LipofectAMINE) cells were fixed and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) 22–24 h later unless indicated otherwise. DNA concentrations were held constant within each experiment. Cell viability was determined by counting 200–600 live/nonapoptotic blue cells/sample and calculated as indicated in the legends. MCF7 Fas cells (provided by Vishva Dixit) were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of green fluorescent protein plasmid and 2 μg of the plasmid of interest, using 2 μl of Lipofectin. Medium containing 200 units/ml TNF was added 24 h after transfection, and cell viability was determined 18 h later by counting green fluorescent protein-positive cells showing apoptotic morphology relative to the total number of green fluorescent protein-positive cells. GST fused to amino acids 87–618 of c-IAP1 was purified from Escherichia coli, cleaved from GST with thrombin and used to immunize rabbits (HRP, Inc., Denver, PA) to generate anti-c-IAP1 antibody. Cell lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer and a mixture of protease inhibitors at 8–24 h postinfection with recombinant viruses or 16–24 h post-transfection and separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis was performed with anti-c-IAP1 (1:1000 dilution) or anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (1:1000 dilution; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). [35S]Met-labeled c-IAP1 protein and derivatives were produced by in vitrotranslation (TnT T7 Quick System, Promega). 1.5 μl of each translation mix was incubated with 10 μl of 293 cell extract prepared as previously described (31Fearnhead H.O. McCurrach M.E. O'Neill J. Zhang K. Lowe S.W. Lazebnik Y.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and 1 mm ATP at 37 °C for ∼15 h in the absence or presence of 100 μm caspase inhibitor DEVD-CHO or zVAD-fmk. Cleavage with recombinant caspase-3 (Merck) was performed as previously described (32Clem R.J. Cheng E.H.Y. Karp C.L. Kirsch D.G. Ueno K. Takahashi A. Kastan M.B. Griffin D.E. Earnshaw W.C. Veliuona M.A. Hardwick J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were purified fromE. coli using glutathione-bound resin and dialyzed extensively against phosphate buffered saline to remove unbound zinc. Protein samples of known concentration (determined by BCA protein assay) were subjected to atomic absorption spectroscopy, and the absorbance at 214 nm (specific for incinerated zinc) was compared with a standard curve of known ZnSO4 concentrations to determine the molar ratio of zinc to protein in each sample. To compare the antiapoptotic activities of IAP family proteins, human c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 were inserted into the Sindbis virus vector and tested for their ability to inhibit Sindbis virus-induced cell death. Sindbis virus triggers classic apoptotic death in many cell types, providing a quantitative analysis of the function of a variety of cell death regulators (30Levine B. Huang Q. Isaacs J.T. Reed J.C. Griffin D.E. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Mammalian XIAP/hILP and baculovirus Op-iap were previously reported to potently protect cells in this assay (33Duckett C.S. Nava V.E. Gedrich R.W. Clem R.J. Van, Dongen J.L. Gilfillan M.C. Shiels H. Hardwick J.M. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2685-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), and both the pro- and antiapoptotic functions of several Bcl-2 family members have been assessed in this manner (27Cheng E.H.Y. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). BHK and N18 murine neuroblastoma cells were infected with recombinant viruses encoding human c-IAP1, c-IAP2, or XIAP, and cell viability was assessed by dye exclusion. Although Bcl-xL and XIAP protected cells from virus-induced cell death, both c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 failed to protect cells compared with Sindbis virus vector controls encoding the same cDNAs in reverse orientation (Fig. 1,A and B). It is possible that Sindbis virus triggers a cell death pathway that is impervious to c-IAP1. In an alternate assay, c-IAP1 was tested for the ability to inhibit apoptosis induced by mBax or hBak in transiently transfected MCF-7 cells. Although Bcl-xL protected cells from apoptotic death induced by cotransfected Bax or Bak, c-IAP1 failed to protect in contrast to earlier work in the same assays (Fig.1 C). To determine whether the RING finger could interfere with antiapoptotic activity, stop codons were inserted into c-IAP1, c-IAP2, or XIAP coding sequences within the Sindbis virus vector to generate truncated proteins lacking the C-terminal RING finger or lacking both the spacer region and RING (Fig. 2 A). CHO cells were infected with recombinant viruses expressing wild type or truncated IAPs, and cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Removing the spacer-RING or RING domains of XIAP had no effect on antiapoptotic function. This result with virus-induced apoptosis is consistent with the observation by others that neither the RING nor the spacer region of XIAP is required for inhibition of TNFα-induced cell death in MCF7-Fas cells (34Duckett C.S. Li F. Wang Y. Tomaselli K.J. Thompson C.B. Armstrong R.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and that the BIR domain of XIAP is sufficient to inhibit caspases (10Takahashi R. Deveraux Q. Tamm I. Welsh K. Assamunt N. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). However, the C-terminal truncations of c-IAP1 conferred a gain of antiapoptotic activity, indicating that the BIR domain was sufficient to inhibit cell death in this assay and that the antiapoptotic function of the BIR domain was suppressed by the RING domain (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were observed in BHK cells (data not shown). The RING deletion mutant was also expressed at slightly higher levels, perhaps contributing to its activity (Fig. 2 C), but expression of the BIR domain alone was problematic and difficult to detect (see below). Thus, changes in protein expression levels may not fully account for the gain-of-function by C-terminal truncations. A time course experiment in CHO cells further demonstrated that deletion of the C-terminal RING finger of c-IAP1 restores the antiapoptotic function of the BIR domain against Sindbis virus (Fig.2 D). In contrast to c-IAP1, deletion of the C-terminal spacer-RING of c-IAP2 failed to confer antiapoptotic activity on c-IAP2 in the Sindbis virus assay (Fig. 2 B). Both full-length and C-terminal truncated c-IAP2 proteins were consistently difficult to detect by immunoblot analysis in Sindbis virus-infected cells, and further analyses of c-IAP2 in this model were abandoned. However, c-IAP2 lacking the spacer-RING region was capable of inhibiting apoptosis induced by TNF treatment of MCF-7 cells, whereas full-length c-IAP2 was inactive in this assay (Fig. 2 E). Deletion of the C-terminal spacer-RING domain of c-IAP2 significantly stabilized c-IAP2 in transfected 293 cells, although respectable levels of c-IAP1 still failed to protect (Fig. 2 F). Taken together, the RING domains of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 but not XIAP were capable of suppressing the antiapoptotic functions of their BIR domains in the assays tested here, which may in part be due to protein stabilization. To further investigate the fate of c-IAP1 protein during apoptosis, lysates prepared from 293 cells infected with recombinant viruses encoding wild type or mutant c-IAP1 were immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum generated against recombinant c-IAP1. The 68-kDa c-IAP1 expressed from recombinant Sindbis virus comigrated with endogenous c-IAP1 (compare c-IAP1 lanes with the 68-kDa band in BIR and ΔCARD lanes in Fig. 3 A). Overexpression increased c-IAP1 protein levels only 3–5-fold over endogenous levels. In addition to full-length protein, an immunoreactive polypeptide of 52 kDa and a less stable 35-kDa polypeptide (open circles in Fig. 3 A) were detected following infection with virus encoding full-length c-IAP1, suggesting that c-IAP1 may be cleaved during apoptosis. Similar results were obtained in COS-1 cells (data not shown). The BIR domain alone (lanes 5–8) was only detected on longer exposures (not shown). Longer exposures also detected the 52-kDa fragment of endogenous c-IAP1 in control virus-infected cells, but the less stable 35-kDa fragment was below detection limits (Fig. 3 B,lanes 1 and 2). Deletion mutants of c-IAP1 were analyzed to determine which portion of c-IAP1 is contained in these apparent cleavage fragments. Deletion of most of the CARD motif (amino acids 471–561) within the spacer region produced a c-IAP1 protein that was 10-kDa smaller as expected (open triangle in Fig. 3 A). This deletion also shifted the 52-kDa fragment to 41 kDa (solid circle in Fig.3 A) and shifted the smaller 35-kDa fragment to 25 kDa (Fig.3 A, inset). In general, the cleavage fragments increased in abundance with time after infection (Fig. 3, A-C). Therefore, both fragments appear to be cleavage products of c-IAP1, and both contain the CARD motif. Both fragments also contain the C-terminal RING finger. Deletion of the 6-kDa RING reduced the size of the 52-kDa cleavage fragment (Fig. 3 B), whereas further deletion of BIR-1 had no effect on the size of the cleavage fragment. Deletion of the RING abolished formation of the 35-kDa fragment, perhaps by destabilizing the polypeptide (Fig. 3 C). This possibility is consistent with our difficulty in detecting the spacer region when expressed alone (see Fig. 6 below). Taken together, these data indicate that c-IAP1 is cleaved during apoptosis to yield 52- and 35-kDa fragments that are both derived from the C terminus. The 35-kDa fragment is likely to consist of the spacer and RING domains because the predicted size of this region is 31.3 kDa and expression of an engineered spacer-RING fragment migrates at ∼35 kDa on SDS gels (see below). The 52-kDa fragment probably contains BIR-2 through the C terminus based on size estimations. The corresponding N-terminal fragments of c-IAP1 could not be identified among the cleavage fragments and may be degraded. To determine whether the 52- and 35-kDa fragments of c-IAP1 are generated by caspase cleavage, in vitro translated35S-labeled c-IAP1 was treated with 293 cell extracts that contain activated caspases (31Fearnhead H.O. McCurrach M.E. O'Neill J. Zhang K. Lowe S.W. Lazebnik Y.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 35Kirsch D.G. Doseff A. Chau B.N. Lin D.-S. de Souza-Pinto N.C.

Hardwick J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 31-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Cleavage of c-IAP1 by the apoptotic cell extract produced a 35-kDa fragment approximately the same size as that observed in apoptotic cells. This cleavage was inhibited by a pan caspase inhibitor zVAD and a caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD (Fig.4A) but was not inhibited by the caspase-1 inhibitor YVAD (data not shown). c-IAP1 was also cleaved to produce a 35-kDa fragment by purified recombinant caspase-3 that was inhibited by zVAD (Fig.4 A). The larger 52-kDa cleavage fragment observed in virus-infected cells was not detected in this in vitro assay unless the CARD domain was deleted, perhaps stabilizing the intermediate cleavage product. Consistent with our observations in apoptotic cells, 293 cell extracts cleaved the in vitrotranslated ΔCARD mutant to the expected 41- and 25-kDa fragments (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). This result confirms that thein vitro cleavage fragments also contain the C-terminal region of c-IAP1. Consistent with our results in apoptotic cells (Fig.3 A), the ΔCARD mutant of c-IAP1 was more stable in thein vitro translation mix compared with wild type full-length c-IAP1 (Fig. 4 B). Cleavage of the ΔCARD mutant of c-IAP1 was detectable as early as 1 h after addition of caspase-3, and densitometry of the uncleaved protein indicated that 72% was cleaved by 4 h (Fig. 4 C). To map the cleavage site responsible for producing the smaller 35/25-kDa fragment, several Asp residues near the beginning of the spacer region were mutated individually in the ΔCARD mutant of c-IAP1. Mutation of Asp372 to Ala abolished formation of the smaller cleavage fragment, whereas mutation of Asp346, Asp364, and Asp387 had no effect on generation of this fragment (Fig. 4 D and data not shown). Surprisingly, mutation of Asp372 also impaired generation of the larger 41-kDa fragment. Mutation of Asp372 may impair subsequent cleavage at a second site, but we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the larger fragment is a post-translationally modified form of the smaller fragment. Because the RING finger squelched the antiapoptotic activity of full-length c-IAP1 and because a C-terminal fragment of c-IAP1 containing the RING finger is generated by caspases in vitroand in apoptotic cells, we tested the possibility that the C terminus of c-IAP1 has proapoptotic function. Transfection of BHK cells with a construct expressing the spacer-RING region of c-IAP1 (amino acids 342–618) induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 A). Similar results were obtained with a fragment containing amino acids 373–618 (data not shown). To determine which portion of the spacer-RING construct was responsible for the induction of apoptosis, several mutants were tested in transfected BHK cells. Deletion of the CARD domain from the spacer-RING (SR-ΔCARD) enhanced proapoptotic activity and correlated with higher protein expression levels, again suggesting that the CARD domain contributes to the instability of the spacer-RING region (Fig.5 B). Similar results were obtained with HA-tagged constructs in CHO and 293 cells (Fig. 5, D and F) and Rat-1 (not shown), except that the ΔCARD mutant of HA-spacer-RING was generally a more potent killer in these cell types, again correlating with increased protein expression compared with the CARD-containing construct (Fig. 5 E). The spacer or RING regions alone lacked pro-death activity compared with control vector (Fig. 5, B,D, and F). The RING domain alone was not detected by the polyclonal anti-c-IAP1 antibody (Fig. 5 B) but was likely to be expressed efficiently based on results with an HA-tagged version (Fig. 5 E). The spacer region alone was consistently present at lower levels even when detected via an HA tag (Fig. 5,B and E). Thus, these experiments do not eliminate the possibility that the spacer region was sufficient for proapoptotic function. However, mutation of three conserved Cys/His residues in the RING (RING*) abolished proapoptotic activity of spacer-RING, verifying that the RING was required for pro-death activity (Fig. 5 C). The pro-death activity of spacer-RING (lacking the CARD domain) in 293 cells was abolished by cotransfection with the caspase inhibitor P35, suggesting that caspases mediate apoptosis induced by the spacer-RING. Higher molecular mass species of the spacer, RING, and spacer-RING domains were frequently observed, suggesting that these proteins are post-translationally modified in cells (plus signs, Figs. 2 F and 5,A–C). To confirm that the spacer-RING domain of c-IAP1 can interfere with the antiapoptotic activity of the BIR domain, we asked whether spacer-RING could impair protection by the BIR domain from Bax-induced cell death. Viability of cells cotransfected with Bax and the BIR domain confirmed that BIR suppressed Bax-induced cell death. Furthermore, cotransfection with spacer-RING abolished the protective activity of BIR in CHO and 293 cells (Fig. 6). To formally demonstrate that the predicted RING domain of c-IAP1 indeed binds zinc, a GST-RING protein was purified from E. coli and tested for its ability to liberate zinc during combustion. Consistent with the fact that RING fingers of other proteins are known to bind 2 mol of zinc, GST-RING bound the same molar ratio of zinc as two BIR domains (GST-BIR2–3) that each coordinate one zinc atom (Fig.7). BIR domains each contain a single zinc finger, confirmed in the recently determined structure of several BIR domains (13Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P. Wang H. Chen J. Zhang H. Wu W. Xu N. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 812-818Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 15Sun C. Cai M. Meadows R.P. Xu N. Gunasekera A.H. Herrmann J. Wu J.C. Fesik S.W. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 6: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This result also suggests that the lack of cell killing activity by the RING finger alone (with or without an HA-tag) is probably not due to defects in protein folding. In contrast to XIAP, full-length c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 failed to protect cells from apoptosis induced by one or more death stimuli including Bax overexpression, virus infection, and TNFα treatment. However, deletion of the C-terminal spacer-RING domains of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 restored the latent antiapoptotic function of the N-terminal BIR domains (Fig. 2). This finding suggests that the C terminus of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 can negatively regulate the antiapoptotic activity of the BIR domains. Interestingly, deletion of the C-terminal spacer-RING of c-IAP2 occurs as the result of a chromosome translocation event commonly found in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas (38Dierlamm J. Baens M. Wlodarska I. Stefanova-Ouzonova M. Hernandez J.M. Hossfeld D.K. De Wolf-Peeters C. Hagemeijer A. Van den Berghe H. Marynen P. Blood. 1999; 93: 3601-3609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps this translocation produces a constitutively antiapoptotic c-IAP2 protein. However, the MALT1 gene to which cIAP-2 is fused in the t(11;18) MALT lymphoma translocations was recently found to encode a paracaspase that is also likely to contribute to disease (39Uren A.G. O'Rouke K. Aravind L. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Konin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion effectively deletes the prodomain of the paracaspase in many of these translocation events (40Baens M. Maes B. Steyls A. Geboes K. Marynen P. De Wolf-Peeters C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1433-1439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), linking it to the BIR domain of c-IAP2. Our results in mammalian cells are consistent with those obtained in aDrosophila eye model where deletion of the RING finger domain of D-IAP1 significantly enhanced its antiapoptotic function against Reaper overexpression and during Drosophila eye development (12Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Similarly, deletion of the c-IAP1 RING was required to protect the third instar eye disc from Reaper-induced cell death. However, in some situations the RING finger may be required for protective function. Full-length c-IAP1 was reported to protect human MCF7 cells from Reaper-induced apoptosis (41McCarthy J.V. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24009-24015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and deletion of the RING finger of D-IAP1, D-IAP2, and MIHA (murine XIAP) impaired their ability to inhibit caspase-1-induced apoptosis in mammalian cells (42Hawkins C. Ekert P. Uren A. Holmgreen S. Vaux D. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the RING of baculovirus Cp-IAP is required for antiapoptotic activity and to inhibit caspase-9 (5Huang Q. Deveraux Q.L. Maeda S. Salvsen G.S. Stennicke H.R. Hammock B.D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1427-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Taking all of these studies together, the RING finger of IAP proteins may positively or negatively modulate the function of IAP proteins, and this modulatory function is presumably dependent in part on cell type-specific factors. At least two factors appear to contribute to the lack of antiapoptotic activity by full-length c-IAP1 during virus-induced apoptosis, protein instability, and susceptibility to caspase cleavage. Deletion of the RING of c-IAP1 was reported to prevent autoubiquitination and degradation of c-IAP1 (20Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Deletion of the RING appeared to stabilize c-IAP1 in virus-infected cells but the observed increase in protein levels may not fully explain the gain of antiapoptotic function. c-IAP1 was also cleaved to 52- and 35-kDa fragments by recombinant caspase-3, by apoptotic cell extracts, and in cells undergoing apoptosis. Furthermore, the 35-kDa spacer-RING fragment was capable of inducing apoptosis and was capable of inhibiting the antiapoptotic function of the BIR domain when expressed on separate plasmids. No function has been attached to the CARD of c-IAPs, and it is not required for direct binding to caspases (7Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar) nor for the proapoptotic function of the spacer-RING fragment. To the contrary, the CARD of c-IAP1 appears to destabilize both the full-length and cleaved fragments of c-IAP1, although the mechanism is not known. Perhaps through dimerization or recruitment to a protein complex the CARD promotes degradation of c-IAP1, or maybe one or more of several Lys residues in the CARD serve as ubiquitination sites. However, both the spacer and RING domains of c-IAP1 appear to be post-translationally modified to produce larger, ∼7–8-kDa immunoreactive bands (marked + in Fig. 5). This size shift is consistent with monoubiquitination, although other possibilities remain. Cleavage of c-IAP1 in apoptotic cells appears to be accomplished by caspases as the same size fragments were generated with caspase-3in vitro, and a caspase inhibitor blocked cleavage of c-IAP1 by apoptotic cell extracts. Deletion analyses indicate that the 35-kDa caspase cleavage product of c-IAP1 contains the spacer-RING domain. This domain of c-IAP1 induces apoptosis in transfected cells, consistent with the finding that the analogous region of D-IAP1 induces cell death when overexpressed in the Drosophila eye (12Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The generation of proapoptotic cleavage products of c-IAP1 during cell death is reminiscent of the finding that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xLare also converted from antiapoptotic to proapoptotic factors by caspase cleavage (32Clem R.J. Cheng E.H.Y. Karp C.L. Kirsch D.G. Ueno K. Takahashi A. Kastan M.B. Griffin D.E. Earnshaw W.C. Veliuona M.A. Hardwick J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 43Cheng E.H.Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). However, the in vivo function of the c-IAP1 spacer-RING fragment that is generated during apoptosis is not known. This fragment of c-IAP1 could potentially decrease cell survival via an independent function perhaps involving ubiquitination of cIAP-1, the BIR domain, or possibly heterologous targets (presumably antiapoptotic factors). The RING domain (without spacer) of cIAP-2 was found to be sufficient for in vitro E3 ligase activity that selectively promoted ubiquitination of caspases 3 and 7 but not caspase 1 (21Huang H. Joazeiro C.A.P. Bonfoco E. Kamada S. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26661-26664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding seems inconsistent with the proapoptotic function of spacer-RING in cells but may imply a role for the spacer region in directing the proapoptotic function of spacer-RING inside cells. Alternatively, spacer-RING could function as a dominant negative inhibitor of c-IAP1, perhaps preventing degradation of caspases. Consistent with this idea, deletion of the N-terminal BIR domain of survivin results in a C-terminal fragment that appears to interfere with endogenous survivin by competing for microtubule binding (44Li F.

https://openalex.org/W2085043108,"Two isoforms of DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) have been identified in mammalian cells. While topo IIα is essential for chromosome segregation in mitotic cells, in vivofunction of topo IIβ remains to be clarified. Here we demonstrate that the nucleoplasmic topo IIβ, highly expressed in differentiating cerebellar neurons, is the catalytically competent entity operating directly on chromatin DNA in vivo. When the cells reached terminal differentiation, this in vivo activity decreased to a negligible level with concomitant loss of the nucleoplasmic enzyme. Effects of topo II-specific inhibitors were analyzed in a primary culture of cerebellar granule neurons that can mimic thein vivo situation. Only the β isoform was expressed in granule cells differentiating in vitro. ICRF-193, a catalytic topo II inhibitor, suppressed the transcriptional induction of amphiphysin I which is essential for mature neuronal activity. The effect decreased significantly as the cells differentiate. Expression profiling with a cDNA macroarray showed that 18% of detectable transcripts were up-regulated during the differentiation and one-third of them were susceptible to ICRF-193. The results suggest that topo IIβ is involved in an early stage of granule cell differentiation by potentiating inducible neuronal genes to become transcribable probably through alterations in higher order chromatin structure.

DNA topoisomerase II external germinal layer phosphate-buffered saline DNA topoisomerase II (topo II)1 is essential for cell proliferation since some mitotic events such as condensation and segregation of daughter chromosomes are entirely dependent on its activity. It is also likely to be involved in other DNA transactions like DNA replication, transcription, and recombination (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar). The enzyme, in a heart-shaped dimer form (2Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), catalyzes topological transformations of DNA by transient cleavage of DNA double strands forming an enzyme-operated gate, followed by passing a second double-stranded DNA segment through the gate (3Liu L.F.

Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Only one form of topo II is present in lower eukaryotes and invertebrates whereas in mammalian cells two isoforms, the 170-kDa topo IIα and the 180-kDa topo IIβ, that are encoded by separate genes have been identified (5Drake F.H. Zimmerman J.P. McCabe F.L. Bartus H.F. Per S.R. Sullivan D.M. Ross W.E. Mattern M.R. Johnson R.K. Crooke S.T. Mirabelli C.K. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 231-234PubMed Google Scholar). These isoforms may share their roles in different cellular functions although they show similar catalytic properties in vitro. From the following observations, topo IIα is considered to be the main isoform involved in the mitotic processes. First, there is a positive correlation between the cellular concentration of topo IIα and the rate of cell proliferation (8Heck M.M. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2569-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 9Drake F.H. Hofmann G.A. Bartus H.F. Mattern M.R. Crooke S.T. Mirabelli C.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8154-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Second, the expression of mRNA for topo IIα is higher in tissues containing proliferating cells (10Capranico G. Tinelli S. Austin C.A. Fisher M.L. Zunino F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and is localized in brain regions enriched with mitotic cells (11Tsutsui K. Tsutsui K. Okada S. Watanabe M. Shohmori T. Seki S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19076-19083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Watanabe M. Tsutsui K. Tsutsui K. Inoue Y. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 19: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Third, the level of topo IIα protein peaks at G2/M phase during the cell cycle (9Drake F.H. Hofmann G.A. Bartus H.F. Mattern M.R. Crooke S.T. Mirabelli C.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8154-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 13Woessner R.D. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K. Johnson R.K. Drake F.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 209-214PubMed Google Scholar) and finally, high affinity binding of topo IIα with chromatin at mitosis is essential for chromosome condensation/segregation and topo IIβ cannot be substituted for topo IIα (14Grue P. Grasser A. Sehested M. Jensen P.B. Uhse A. Straub T. Ness W. Boege F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33660-33666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast to topo IIα, functional aspect of topo IIβ remains obscure (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 15Austin C.A. Marsh K.L. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrated a significant level of topo II activity in isolated nuclei from post-mitotic neuronal cells (16Tsutsui K. Tsutsui K. Sakurai H. Shohmori T. Oda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 1116-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Tsutsui K. Tsutsui K. Oda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7644-7652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that was shown later to be attributable to the β isoform (11Tsutsui K. Tsutsui K. Okada S. Watanabe M. Shohmori T. Seki S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19076-19083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of topo IIβ was also shown in other nonproliferative or fully differentiated tissues at both the transcript (10Capranico G. Tinelli S. Austin C.A. Fisher M.L. Zunino F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and the protein levels (18Bauman M.E. Holden J.A. Brown K.A. Harker W.G. Perkins S.L. Mod. Pathol. 1997; 10: 168-175PubMed Google Scholar, 19Turley H. Comley M. Houlbrook S. Nozaki N. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Gatter K. Harris A.L. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 1340-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cell cycle analysis in cultured cells showed that the level of topo IIβ was not altered significantly and, in a sharp contrast to topo IIα, it rather increased slightly as cells reached a plateau phase (9Drake F.H. Hofmann G.A. Bartus H.F. Mattern M.R. Crooke S.T. Mirabelli C.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8154-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 13Woessner R.D. Mattern M.R. Mirabelli C.K. Johnson R.K.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24523-24526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of topo IIβ in these immortalized cell lines, however, is probably deregulated. Topo IIβ is even dispensable for cell proliferation and survival in vitro since in some cell lines the enzyme is not expressed at all (21Chen M. Beck W.T. Oncol. Res. 1995; 7: 103-111PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that topo IIβ is not required for maintenance of general cellular activities but rather involved in more specific processes in vivo. The cerebellar cortex has a unique structure with laminar arrangement of cells that is formed during the development in early postnatal period. A number of mRNAs were identified to be expressed specifically at distinct stages of cerebellar development (22Hatten M.E. Heintz N. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 385-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 23Hatten M.E. Alder J. Zimmerman K. Heintz N. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We have shown previously using in situ hybridization that in the first two postnatal weeks the signal levels for topo IIβ mRNA increased on the cerebellar granule cells actively differentiating in the granular layer, suggesting a link between the topo IIβ expression and the cerebellar development (12Watanabe M. Tsutsui K. Tsutsui K. Inoue Y. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 19: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cerebellar system also appears to be ideal in elucidating the physiological function of topo IIβ since the control of its expression in cultured cell lines may well be aberrant. Parenthetically, there have been no detailed studies on temporo-spatial expression of topo II isoforms in living tissues. In the present study, we discriminated the catalytically competent entity of topo II isoforms that is acting on chromatin DNA in the developing cerebellar tissue. Postnatal expression levels and intranuclear localization of topo IIβ were also traced in the cerebellar neuronal lineages, Purkinje cells and granule cells. We finally assessed the requirement of topo IIβ activity in the expression of neuronal genes in a primary culture of differentiating granule cells by use of topo II-specific inhibitors. Our results are consistent with the defects in embryonic neural development identified recently in topo IIβ knockout mice (24Yang X. Li W. Prescott E.D. Burden S.J. Wang J.C. Science. 2000; 287: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Full-length cDNA for human topo IIα was expressed in Escherichia coli, and mice were immunized with purified protein to prepare monoclonal antibodies as described previously (25Kimura K. Nozaki N. Enomoto T. Tanaka M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21439-21445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). One of the isolated clones, 4E12, recognized a NH2-terminal fragment (residues numbers 1–40), and was cross-reactive to rodent topo IIα (26Tohda H. Takao M. Kikuchi A. Yasumoto T. Yasui A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Full-length cDNA for human topo IIβ was expressed and mouse monoclonal antibodies were prepared as above. One of the isolated clones, 3B6, was also reactive to rodent topo IIβ (26Tohda H. Takao M. Kikuchi A. Yasumoto T. Yasui A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), recognizing a COOH-terminal fragment (residues numbers 1178–1273). IgG was purified from the serum of a breast cancer patient with anti-amphiphysin I autoantibodies and paraneoplastic sensory neuropathy (27Floyd S. Butler M.H. Cremona O. David C. Freyberg Z. Zhang X. Solimena M. Tokunaga A. Ishizu H. Tsutsui K. De Camilli P. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 29-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A mouse monoclonal antibody to the rat neurofilament proteins (160 K/210 K) was purchased from IBL (Gunma, Japan). Nuclei were prepared from cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and thymus of male Wistar rats as described previously (28Tsutsui K. Tsutsui K. Muller M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7235-7241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear samples were pretreated with 50 μg/ml DNase I at room temperature for 30 min prior to electrophoresis. Topo II-enriched fraction was extracted from the purified nuclei with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 m NaCl, and 140 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Cultured granule cells were directly lyzed in the loading buffer with a brief sonication. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 1 min in a loading buffer and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Separated proteins in gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting and processed for immunodetection according to a standard procedure. Secondary antibodies were peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies (Bio-Rad) and the peroxidase activity was visualized with 4-methoxy-1-naphthol and hydrogen peroxide. Male Wistar rats under deep anesthesia were perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4). The brain was dissected out, post-fixed with the same solution, and cryoprotected with 20% sucrose in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4). After trimming, the brain blocks were frozen rapidly and sectioned at a thickness of 10 μm on a cryostat. Frozen sagittal sections were thaw-mounted on glass slides precoated with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, followed by washing with PBS (150 mm NaCl in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4), blocking with PBS containing 10% goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100, and incubation for 15 h with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (TPBS). The incubation was performed either at 37 °C (monoclonal antibodies against topo II isoforms) or at room temperature (all the other antibodies). After washing with TPBS, the sections were incubated successively at room temperature with biotinylated goat secondary antibodies (Vector Labs) and with the ABC reagent (Vectastain ABC Kit, Vector Labs). The peroxidase reaction was visualized with diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide. Cultured granule cells that were grown on coverslips precoated with poly-l-lysine were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 15 min. The fixed cells were immunostained as described above for tissue sections. The brain tissue was perfused as described above except that the solution did not contain picric acid. Frozen sagittal sections (14 μm) were mounted on glass slides as mentioned, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 10% goat serum and 10% horse serum in TPBS. After incubation with various primary antibodies diluted in TPBS containing 3% horse serum for 15 h, sections were washed with PBS, followed by incubation with fluorescent conjugates of goat secondary antibodies in PBS at room temperature for 30 min. DNA was then stained with 0.25 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in PBS. Stained sections were mounted in an antifade solution (Prolong Antifade Kit, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and examined under an OLYMPUS epifluorescence microscope (BX60-FLB) coupled to a cooled monochromatic CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) or OLYMPUS laser scanning microscope (FLUOVIEW-BX50). Recorded digital images were processed later using Adobe Photoshop software. From male Wistar rats of P10, the cerebellum was dissected out under deep anesthesia and immediately cut into 1-mm thick slices on ice (about 10 sagittal slices), submerged in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 with or without 100 μm etoposide, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in a CO2 incubator. The slices were homogenized with 3 ml of 1% (v/v) Sarkosyl in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA (TE buffer), and then fractionated by centrifugation on a CsCl step gradient (2-ml layers of CsCl solutions in TE buffer with densities of 1.82, 1.72, 1.50, and 1.37 g/cm3) according to Muller and Mehta (29Muller M.T. Mehta V.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3661-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Density of the gradient fractions (0.5 ml) was calculated from the refractive index of each fraction. DNA concentration was estimated by a spectrophotometric method based on the Warburg-Christian equation. Aliquots (47 μl for topo IIα detection and 12 μl for topo IIβ detection) of each fraction were diluted 1:3 with TE buffer and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using a slot blotting apparatus (Bio-Dot SF, Bio-Rad). The membranes were then processed for immunostaining with topo II isoform-specific monoclonal antibodies according to the procedure described above. Stains on the membrane were scanned on a scanner and topo II isoforms in each fraction were quantified using a densitometric software, Intelligent Quantifier (Bio Image). Cerebellar granule cells were prepared from the cerebellum of P8 Wistar rats and processed for culture as described previously (30Sakurai H. Kurusu R. Sano K. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The tissue was treated briefly with trypsin and DNase I and the dispersed cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 25 mm KCl, and 60 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate. The cell suspension from one cerebellum was dispensed into 6 plastic culture dishes (60 mm in diameter) precoated with poly-l-lysine. After 24 h in culture, proliferation of non-neuronal cells was prevented by replacing the medium with that containing 10 μm cytosine arabinoside. The medium was refreshed at the end of day 3. Cells remained viable under these conditions for at least 8 days in culture. Total cellular RNA was prepared from the cultured cells by using a commercial kit (RNeasy, Quiagen). RNA samples (17 μg/lane) were electrophoresed and blotted as described previously (11Tsutsui K. Tsutsui K. Okada S. Watanabe M. Shohmori T. Seki S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19076-19083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA clones encoding the neuronal markers (amphiphysin I, amphiphysin II, synaptophysin, and γ-aminobutyric acid receptor α6) were first obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a rat brain cDNA library (Uni-Zap XR, Stratagene) with unique primer sets designed to amplify 500–1500-base pair regions of the cDNAs. Products were cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and verified by nucleotide sequencing. Hybridization probes were prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the cloned cDNA fragments with the same primer sets. The purified products were labeled by a random-primed synthesis with [α-32P]dCTP. Hybridization was carried out under standard conditions at 42 °C overnight in a solution containing 50% (v/v) formamide. A cDNA macroarray system (Atlas Rat 1.2 Array, Clontec) was used for determination of relative levels of mRNAs that are expressed in granule neurons differentiating in vitro. Total cellular RNA was isolated from untreated granule cells at day 1, at day 5, and ICRF-treated cells at day 5 as described above. The following procedures were performed according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Briefly, RNA preparations were first treated with DNase I, followed by enrichment of poly(A)+ RNA on streptoavidin magnetic beads. RNA templates bound to the beads were subjected to cDNA synthesis with rat CDS primer mixture and [α-32P]dATP. Purified cDNA probes (>6.5 × 106 cpm) were hybridized to the arrayed rat cDNA membranes under recommended conditions. Washed membranes were exposed against the imaging plate for 12 h at room temperature and hybridization signals were quantified on the BAS 2000 analyzer using an array-analysis software ArrayGauge (Fuji Film). As we have shown previously, mRNAs of both topo IIα and topo IIβ were detected by in situ hybridization in the P10 rat cerebellum (11Tsutsui K. Tsutsui K. Okada S. Watanabe M. Shohmori T. Seki S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19076-19083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the expression of these enzymes at the protein level, nuclei isolated from rat tissues were first subjected to Western blot analysis. A monoclonal antibody, 3B6, raised against human topo IIβ specifically recognized a 180-kDa polypeptide in rat cerebellum (Fig.1, lane 5). A band with the same mobility was also detected in cerebral cortex (lane 6) but not in P14 rat thymus (lane 4) unless the color development was prolonged. In contrast to topo IIβ, Western blot signals were quite low when total nuclear proteins were probed with a monoclonal antibody, 4E12, raised against human topo IIα. However, when nuclear salt extracts enriched with topo II were used for the analysis, the antibody detected an immunoreactive band of 170 kDa, the molecular mass expected for canonical topo IIα, in both thymus and cerebellum (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2), but still failed to detect any reactive bands in cerebral cortex (lane 3). These results are consistent with the levels of transcripts estimated previously by Northern blot analysis and further support the idea that the expression of topo IIα is tightly associated with cell proliferation whereas that of topo IIβ is not (11Tsutsui K. Tsutsui K. Okada S. Watanabe M. Shohmori T. Seki S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19076-19083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results also confirmed that both isoforms of topo II are expressed in P10 rat cerebellum and that the monoclonal antibodies, 4E12 and 3B6, can be used as a specific probe for topo IIα and topo IIβ, respectively. The results presented above or simple immunohistochemical detection methods with specific antibodies do not provide information on the abundance of catalytically active topo II molecules. Although it is possible to measure topo II activities in tissue extracts, this in vitroactivity on naked DNA does not reflect the topo II enzyme acting on DNAin situ, since their accessibility is largely restrictedin vivo by local chromatin structures (31Udvardy A. Schedl P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4973-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Kas E. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The way to circumvent this problem is to take advantage of the unique property of topo II enzymes. A class of topo II inhibitors, sometimes referred to as “topo II poisons,” such as etoposide (VP-16) binds specifically to the enzyme and stabilizes the topo II-DNA covalent complex (cleavable complex) by preventing the religation of transiently cleaved DNA strands (33Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6157-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Upon addition of strong detergents, the complex is disrupted to liberate DNA fragments with denatured topo II protein covalently attached to the 5′ termini. For quantitative estimation of functional topo II isoforms in the developing rat cerebellum, cerebellar slices were incubated with etoposide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The tissue was then homogenized in Sarkosyl, and the functioning topo II molecules cross-linked to DNA were separated from the free enzyme by CsCl step gradient centrifugation. Gradient fractions were blotted onto membranes and probed with the monoclonal antibodies to topo IIα or topo IIβ, thus enabling the isoform-specific detection. Fig. 2 shows a representative result obtained with P10 rat cerebellum. When the tissue was incubated in the absence of etoposide, both topo IIα and topo IIβ were completely recovered in fractions with a density of typical proteins (Fig. 2,A and C). In the presence of etoposide, however, 55% of topo IIα and 22% of topo IIβ were recovered in the DNA peak fractions at around 1.69 g/cm3 (Fig. 2, Band D). The immunoreactive material in the DNA peak fractions represents the topo II-DNA complexes accumulated during the incubation with etoposide, and thus reflects an in vivoactivity of enzymes that are accessible to chromatin DNA. The density of these complexes is comparable to that of bulk DNA because of the small topo II versus DNA mass ratio. When the lysate DNA was fragmented by sonication before loading the gradient, the peak of topo II-DNA complexes shifted toward the right depending on the extent of sonication and became separated from the DNA peak. By estimating the average length of DNA fragments, it was calculated that under these conditions one or two topo II monomers are cross-linked to a few kilobase pairs of DNA. In rodents, the gross organization of cerebellar tissue initiates after birth and is completed within 3 weeks. During this period, the precursor for granule cells, the most abundant neurons in central nervous system, proliferate in the outmost layer (external germinal layer, EGL), then migrate inward through the molecular layer and the Purkinje cell layer to form the granular layer, where they continue to differentiate establishing neuronal connections (34Altman J. Bayer S.A. Development of the Cerebellar System in Relation to Its Evolution, Structure, and Functions. CRC Press, New York1997Google Scholar). Using the cross-linking technique, we next assessed the in vivoactivity of topo II isoforms and their total protein levels during the postnatal development of rat cerebellum (Fig.3). The difference in the densitometric levels indicated on the ordinate roughly reflects the relative abundance of topo II isoforms in the cerebellum. Topo IIα linked to DNA increased rapidly during the first 5 days after birth, reaching a peak at P9, and sharply decreased thereafter in the second week to a negligible level at P20 (Fig. 3 A). More than 50% of topo IIα was cross-linked to DNA between P5 and P10 when its expression level was also high. At P27, topo IIα was no longer detectable in both the DNA peak fractions and free protein fractions. On the other hand, topo IIβ showed a triphasic time course during the postnatal development (Fig. 3 B). In both its total amount and the DNA-linked forms, the enzyme gave a high signal already at P1 and after a transient decrease at P5, turned to increase again (second phase). The topo IIβ-DNA complex stayed at a high level during the first 2 weeks, decreased gradually in the third week, and became almost undetectable at P27. Interestingly, the peak of granule cell differentiation in the second week coincides with the period when topo IIβ is most active on chromatin. The total amount of topo IIβ was also maintained at an elevated level during the first 2 weeks, then decreased to about half the maximum level at P20, and in contrast to topo IIα, this level was maintained at P27 (third phase) and even in adulthood. The time course of topo IIβ expression was also confirmed by a conventional Western blotting of tissue lysates (Fig. 3 B, open triangles). To identify what cell populations contribute to the levels of total enzyme and their in vivo activities, spacial distribution of topo II isoforms in the developing cerebellar cortex was visualized by immunostaining (Fig. 4). The topo IIα-positive cells in EGL were already present at P1, increased in number to peak at P10, and decreased to disappear at P25 (Fig.4 A). This changing pattern closely parallels the monophasic time course of its in vivo activity (Fig. 3 A), which can thus be ascribed to the granule cell progenitors proliferating in the mitotic zone of EGL. Topo IIα signal was not detected in Purkinje cells throughout the postnatal period, being consistent with the fact that their final cell division occurs in an embryonic stage. With respect to the in vivo activity of topo IIβ (Fig. 3 B), the initial phase is likely due to the multilayered Purkinje cells that constitute the major population of topo IIβ-positive cells at P1 (Fig. 4 A). The fluorescence and confocal microscopy at a higher magnification revealed that both nucleoplasm and nucleolus are brightly stained in P1 Purkinje cells (Fig. 4 B). As they mature, the topo IIβ signal decreased significantly in nucleoplasm but persisted in nucleoli. Granule cells should contribute little to the topo IIβ activity at P1 since its population size is still small and granular layer is not generated yet. However, the second phase of the topo IIβ activity that peaks around P9 is clearly accounted for by the growing population of differentiating granule cells. Granule cell nuclei in the granular layer were highly labeled with anti-topo IIβ antibody at P10 but the signal was attenuated significantly at P25 when granule cells reach maturity (Fig. 4 B). After the completion of cerebellar architecture, there is an intriguing discrepancy between the amount of topo IIβ expressed in nuclei and that actually acting on DNA. At this stage, a large proportion of the enzyme appears to be localized in nucleoli (Fig. 4 B). The topographical and chronological analyses on the levels of topo IIβ expression and its in vivo activity suggested that the isoform β may play a critical role in the differentiation process of cerebellar neurons. To further investigate this possibility, we used a primary culture system for cerebellar granule cells that has been well established and used successfully in many studies. Expression of various genes required for neuronal maturation was shown to be tightly regulated in the course of culture, mimicking the in vivo situation (35Beattie C.E. Siegel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1784-1792"
https://openalex.org/W2090560369,"The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR2 possess extended intracellular C-terminal domains by which they can directly interact with a large number of postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins involved in synaptic clustering and signaling. We have previously shown that PSD-associated alpha-calmodulin kinase II (alphaCaMKII) binds with high affinity to the C-terminal domain of the NR2A subunit. Here, we show that residues 1412-1419 of the cytosolic tail of NR2A are critical for alphaCaMKII binding, and we identify, by site directed mutagenesis, PKC-dependent phosphorylation of NR2A(Ser(1416)) as a key mechanism in inhibiting alphaCaMKII-binding and promoting dissociation of alphaCaMKII.NR2A complex. In addition, we show that stimulation of PKC activity in hippocampal slices either with phorbol esters or with the mGluRs specific agonist trans-1-amino-1,3- cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (t-ACPD) decreases alphaCaMKII binding to NMDA receptor complex. Thus, our data provide clues on understanding the molecular basis of a direct cross-talk between alphaCaMKII and PKC pathways in the postsynaptic compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2001840006,"Acrolein is produced extensively in the environment by incomplete combustion of organic materials, and it arises endogenously in humans as a metabolic by-product. Acrolein reacts with DNA at guanine residues to form the exocyclic adduct, 8-hydroxypropanodeoxyguanosine (HOPdG). Acrolein is mutagenic, and a correlation exists between HOPdG levels in <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> treated with acrolein and a resultant increase in mutation frequency. Site-specifically modified oligonucleotides were used to explore the mutagenic potential of HOPdG in <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains that were either wild-type for repair or deficient in nucleotide excision repair or base excision repair. Oligonucleotides modified with HOPdG were inserted into double-stranded bacteriophage vectors using the gapped-duplex method or into single-stranded bacteriophage vectors and transformed into SOS-induced <i>E. coli</i> strains. Progeny phage were analyzed by oligonucleotide hybridization to establish the mutation frequency and the spectrum of mutations produced by HOPdG. The correct base, dCMP, was incorporated opposite HOPdG in all circumstances tested. In contrast, <i>in vitro</i> lesion bypass studies showed that HOPdG causes misincorporation opposite the modified base and is a block to replication. The combination of these studies showed that HOPdG is not miscoding <i>in vivo</i> at the level of sensitivity of these site-specific mutagenesis assays."

Hence, CD4 has been termed a coreceptor (21Janeway Jr., C.A. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 234-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of CD4 is noncovalently associated with p56lck, a Src-like tyrosine kinase, and also contains membrane proximal palmitoylation sites that direct CD4 to lipid rafts enriched in additional signaling molecules (22Rudd C.E.

Littman D.R. Cell. 1993; 74: 633-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To date, biophysical parameters of CD4 interaction with pMHCII and TCR ectodomain components have not been measured. Attempts to quantitate TCR-independent binding between CD4 and pMHCII in human and mouse systems using cell-based assays and soluble CD4 ectodomain constructs have suggested a weak interaction (K d > 100 μm) (15Sakihama T. Smolyar A. Reinherz E.L. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 581-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27Hussey R.E. Richardson N.E. Kowalski M. Brown N.R. Chang H.C. Siliciano R.F.

Immunol. 1993; 5: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the precise affinity and kinetics of binding are unknown. Furthermore, whether CD4 ectodomain interaction with pMHCII is modulated by the TCR or, alternatively, whether prior CD4-pMHCII interaction alters the MHC antigen-presenting platform, augmenting subsequent TCR affinity for its ligand is uncertain. In the present study, we have utilized highly purified recombinant TCR, pMHCII, and CD4 ectodomains to address these questions. The results offer insight into the fundamental nature of CD4-pMHCII interaction, further elucidate the role of CD4 in class II MHC-restricted TCR recognition, and indicate that if an interaction exists between CD4 and TCR extracellular segments it must involve components other than or in addition to the TCR αβ heterodimer. Plasmids pEE14-D10αB and pEE14-D10βA were used as polymerase chain reaction templates to generate cDNAs encoding the extracellular domains of D10 α and β subunits. The 5′ polymerase chain reaction primers contained a XbaI restriction site, a ribosome binding site, and a methionine initiation codon proximal to the first amino acid residue of each mature subunit. The 3′ primers encoded a stop codon (TAA) and a BamHI restriction site. To avoid cysteine mispairing and incorrect disulfide bond formation, both α and β subunit sequences were terminated before their respective most-C-terminal cysteines utilized to form an interchain disulfide bond in the native protein. Moreover, the unpaired cysteine at position 109 in the α chain was changed to serine (TGC to TCC) by overlapping polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment replacement. The α and β subunit genes were inserted individually betweenXbaI and BamHI sites within the expression vector pET-11a (Novagen). After DNA sequences were confirmed, the expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) separately. Protein expression and inclusion body preparation of D10 α and β subunits were performed by the Cell Production and Recovery Facility, Rutgers University. Briefly, bacterial cells transformed with either pET-D10α or pET-D10β expression vectors were grown in a 50-liter bioreactor at 37 °C in 4 × YT medium (32 g/liter bactotryptone, 20 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 2% glycerol. 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce protein expression at A 600 = 8–12, and cells were harvested 4 h after the induction. Cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 10 ml/g cell wet weight and lysed. Lysate was then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 5 μg/ml DNaseI and 4 mm MgCl2 added. Inclusion bodies were spun down and washed twice with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 followed by two washes with washing buffer alone. The inclusion body pellets were frozen at −80 °C and used for subsequent purification. D10 TCR αβ heterodimer was refolded as described previously (29Garboczi D.N. Utz U. Ghosh P. Seth A. Kim J. Van Tienhoven E.A. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5403-5410PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. The α and β inclusion bodies were dissolved separately in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 10 mm EDTA and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol and centrifuged at high speed. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. The denatured α and β inclusion bodies (1 μmol of each) were added together to 10–12 ml of 6 mguanidine-HCl, 10 mm sodium acetate, and 10 mmEDTA, pH 4.2. The mixture was then diluted dropwise into 1 liter of cold refolding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mml-arginine-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm reduced glutathione, 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with vigorous stirring. After the refolding solution was incubated at 4 °C with slow stirring for 6–12 h, another α/β mixture was added. A third mixture was added 6–12 h later, and a further 24-h incubation was performed. The refolded material was filtered (Corning, 0.22 μm) and immunoaffinity-purified using mAb 3D3 covalently coupled γ bind plus Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 5 mg of mAb/ml of beads. The correctly refolded TCR protein was eluted with low pH buffer (0.5 m acetic acid, 10% glycerol, pH 3.0) and adjusted to pH 5.0–6.0 immediately using 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. The protein was then concentrated using a Centriprep-10 concentrator (Amicon) and sized on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate/acetic acid, pH 5.0, and 100 mm NaCl. The purified protein was finally concentrated, and the buffer was changed to 20 mm sodium acetate/acetic acid, pH 5.0. The scD10 TCR consists of 237 residues and is organized from N to C terminus as follows: Vβ8.2 (residues 3–116)-linker (GSADDAKKDAAKKDG)-Vα2 (residues 1–117), with a mutation at C235S. Bacterial expression and inclusion body purification were the same as that of the D10 TCR (described above). An efficient refolding was achieved by diluting rapidly into a refolding buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mm arginine, 2 m urea, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.4 mm oxidized glutathione). The refolded material was then applied to a 3D3 affinity column followed by gel filtration on Superdex 75, and buffer was changed to 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, with 0.025% sodium azide. The human CD4 ectodomain (residues 1–371) was expressed in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary-derived Lec3.2.8.1 cells (30Stanley P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) using the glutamine synthetase vector pEE14 (31Liu J. Tse A.G.D. Chang H.-C. Liu J.-H. Wang J. Hussey R.E. Chishti Y. Reinhold B.

To this end, 20 μg of linearized plasmid DNA pEE14-hCD4 was transfected into Lec3.2.8.1 cells by a calcium phosphate precipitation method using a transfection MBS kit (Stratagene) as described (32Kern P. Hussey R.E. Spoerl R. Reinherz E.L. Chang H.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27237-27243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). 48 h later, the transfected cells were harvested and cultured on 96-well plates in Glasgow minimal essential medium supplemented with 25 μm methionine sulfoximine. After feeding the cells for 4 weeks, the growing clones were selected and assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 4 μg/ml anti-D1 domain of hCD4 mAb, 19Thy5D7, was coated onto Immulon plates (Dynatech) overnight at 4 °C and blocked by 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. Then 50 μl of supernatant from individual clones was added to each well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The reaction was followed by adding 0.1 mg/ml biotinylated mAb OKT4 (anti-D3 domain of hCD4) and developed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Once identified, positive clones were transferred to 24-well plates and then to 6-well plates and rescreened. Subsequently, the highest-expressing clone was picked and amplified for large scale production as described previously (31Liu J. Tse A.G.D. Chang H.-C. Liu J.-H. Wang J. Hussey R.E. Chishti Y.

Yields averaged 40 mg/liter culture supernatant. After each expression, the supernatant was filtered (Corning, 0.22 μm) and immunoaffinity-purified by mAb 19Thy5D7-coupled Affi-Gel 10 beads (Bio-Rad). The hCD4 protein was eluted by 0.5 m acetic acid, pH 3.5, and neutralized to pH 7.0 immediately by adding 1m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. For BIAcore assay, the protein was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column and concentrated to 20–50 mg/ml. The mature I-Ak β chain was fused at its N terminus via a flexible linker with a 13-residue hen egg conalbumin (CA) peptide (residues 153–165) that is recognized by D10 TCR. The 37-residue leucine zipper (LZ) sequences were appended to both C termini of the α (residues -3–192) and β (residues 3–198) chains by flexible thrombin-cleavable spacers. The cDNA constructions were subcloned into the pEE14 vector and expressed in Lec3.2.8.1 cells as described above. The screening of secreted recombinant protein in the culture supernatant was performed by both Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and BIAcore using antibodies specific for either the CA/I-Ak (10.2.16) or the LZ epitope (2H11 or 13A12). The yield was ∼0.7 mg of CA/I-Ak/liter of supernatant. Protein in production supernatant was purified by 2H11 affinity chromatography followed by Superdex 75 gel filtration. Protein concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry at 280 nm using factors of 1.2 (scD10), 1.4 (D10), 1.5 (CA/I-Ak), and 1.4 ml/mg/cm (hCD4), respectively. The factors were acquired from extinction coefficients that were calculated based on the tryptophan, tyrosine, and cysteine contents of each protein (33Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequence was performed on each protein after blotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a 120A sequencer (Applied Biosystems). All binding studies were performed on a BIAcore1000 surface plasmon resonance biosensor (BIAcore) in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant p-20, pH 7.4) at 25 °C. For indirect binding assay, an anti-LZ mAb, 13A12 (34Chang H.-C. Bao Z.-Z. Yao Y. Tse A.G.D. Goyarts E.C. Madsen M. Kawasaki E. Brauer P.P. Sacchettini J.C. Nathenson S.G. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11408-11412Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), was coupled to the CM5 sensorchip using a standard amine coupling kit (BIAcore), resulting in ∼8,000 RU coupled. 30 μl of 1 μm CA/I-Ak-LZ was injected over the surface at a flow rate of 10 μl/min and followed by a dissociation period of 3 min. Different analytes (D10 or scD10 TCRs or hCD4) were then passed through the13A12-CA/I-Ak-LZ surface either at a high flow rate (50 μl/min for kinetic studies) or at a low flow rate (5 μl/min for equilibrium studies). The specific binding was taken after subtracting the response on a control surface (the same 13A12 immobilized surface but without any CA/I-Ak-LZ captured). CD4 protein was coupled on the CM5 chip directly using an amine coupling kit, ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 RU, and analytes were then injected over the flow cell at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for affinity studies. An irrelevant anti-gp140 mAb 116 Fab fragment was immobilized at the same level as a control surface. BIAevaluation 3.0 software (BIAcore) was used for data analysis. Kinetic data fitting was performed using a Langmuir 1:1 binding model (BIAcore), and equilibrium data were analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting or Scatchard plotting RU/concentration versus RU followed by linear regression (Cricket-Graph software). The COS-7 cell transfection of human CD4 and the inhibition effect of CD4 on human MHC class II B-lymphoblastoid Raji cells binding were performed as described previously (15Sakihama T. Smolyar A. Reinherz E.L. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 581-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 104 COS-7 cells were plated into each well of Falcon 6-well plates and transfected by a calcium phosphate/chloroquine method (35Landau N.R. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5110-5113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 5 μg of either full-length hCD4 DNA (residues 1–435 cloned in the CDM8 vector) or CDM8 vector DNA alone as a control. Two days later, the cell binding assay was performed. 3 × 106 Raji cells were pre-incubated in 1 ml of medium containing various concentrations of affinity-purified hCD4 protein or bovine serum albumin (as negative control) at 37 °C for 30 min and then added to transfected COS-7 cells. The 6-well plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the rosettes formed by B Raji cell-COS-7 cell binding were counted under microscopic magnification. As a positive control for inhibition, 15 μg of 19Thy5D7 was added to transfected COS-7 cells and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before adding the B cells. The inhibition percentage was calculated as 100 × [(R c −R I)/ R c], whereR c and R I represent the rosette numbers in the absence or presence of inhibitor, respectively. To study the interaction between a MHC class II-restricted TCR, its ligands, and CD4 coreceptor, recombinant ectodomains corresponding to each were expressed and purified. An αβ TCR heterodimer derived from the mouse T cell clone D10 (D10 TCR), specific for the hen egg CA foreign peptide (residues 153–165) associated with the self-MHC class II I-Ak molecule (pMHCII), was constructed (Fig.1 a). The α and β subunits of the D10 TCR were truncated at residues 200 and 238 within their respective extracellular segments proximal to the cysteines involved in the interchain disulfide bond formation. Furthermore, to avoid cysteine mispairing, α chain cysteine 109 was replaced by a serine. The α and β subunits were expressed separately as inclusion bodies inE. coli and refolded together at a 1:1 molar ratio as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The refolded αβ TCR was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the 3D3 anti-D10 TCR clonotypic mAb followed by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column. A yield of 6–8 mg of purified protein/liter of starting material (∼150 mg of inclusion bodies) was obtained. The purified protein can be stored at 4 °C at high concentration (up to 1 mm) with little tendency to form aggregates. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified protein shows that the α and β chains are present in equal molar amounts (Fig. 1 b,lane 1 and 2). Since the interchain disulfide bond was mutated, no covalently linked heterodimer band is seen under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1 b, lane 2). The faster mobility of the α and β bands on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing relative to reducing conditions (Fig. 1 b, lane 2 versus 1; 23 versus 26 kDa for α and 27 versus 30 kDa for β) is a consequence of the two intra-chain disulfide bonds in each subunit leading to a more compact structure. Expected N-terminal sequences of both α and β chains were confirmed by Edman degradation after transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. To assess the integrity of the α and β constant domains, the TCR protein was immunoprecipitated with TCR Cα-specific mAb H28 and Cβ-specific mAb H57. SDS-PAGE showed that the TCR was precipitated by both mAbs. The TCR-mAb complexes were readily observed by native gel and equivalent to D10 expressed in the mammalian Chinese hamster ovary derivative Lec 3.2.8.1 cells as a glycosylated protein with the intact interchain disulfide bonds (data not shown). Given that the 3D3 mAb used for purification recognizes a conformational epitope dependent on the proper juxtaposition of Vα and Vβ domains, the above results indicate that the purified D10 TCR assumes a correctly folded conformation in both V- and C-region modules. To investigate any possible function of the C module in antigen recognition or CD4 interaction, we compared the above D10 αβ TCR heterodimer with a scD10 TCR VαVβ module. As shown in Fig.1 a, the latter contains the D10 TCR Vβ domain connected from its C terminus by a flexible linker, a 15-amino acid residue peptide (GSADDAKKDAAKKDG), to the N terminus of the D10 TCR Vα domain. Like the D10 TCR, the scD10 protein was expressed in E. coli, refolded in vitro, and purified by 3D3 affinity column followed by gel filtration on Superdex 75. The scD10 protein appears as a single band migrating at 31 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 1 b, lane 3). A cDNA encoding the four extracellular domains of human CD4 (Fig.1 a) in the pEE14 plasmid was transfected and expressed in the glycosylation mutant Lec3.2.8.1 derivative of Chinese hamster ovary cells, which produce glycoproteins with homogenous sugar adducts. In these cells, N-linked carbohydrates are of the Man5 form, and O-linked carbohydrates are truncated to a single GalNac (30Stanley P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The yield of hCD4 was more than 40 mg/liter culture supernatant, and the protein was readily purified by affinity chromatography on an anti-CD4 D1 mAb 19Thy5D7-coupled Affi-Gel 10 column followed by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column. The protein shows high purity as well as size and charge homogeneity on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 b, lane 5 and 6) and native gel (data not shown), respectively. As with the TCR constructs, the faster mobility of the protein under nonreducing conditions (45 kDaversus 47 kDa) indicates the formation of the expected intrachain disulfide bonds. The ability of other mAbs such as OKT4 (a CD4 D3-specific mAb) to react with the protein was verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). The peptide-bound murine MHC class II molecule CA/I-Ak, the D10 ligand, was produced in recombinant form from Lec3.2.8.1 cells as well. This pMHCII protein consists of the extracellular domains of the noncovalently associated α and β subunits, with a 13-residue peptide corresponding to residues 153–165 of hen CA attached to the N terminus of the β chain and the leucine zipper sequences appended to the C termini of both chains (Fig. 1 a). Although the linkage of the peptide to the class II MHC is distinct from that found under natural circumstances, crystallographic analysis of the pMHCII protein demonstrates a native structure (36Reinherz E.L. Tan K. Tang L. Kern P. Liu J.-H. Xiong Y. Hussey R.E. Smolyar A. Hare B. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Chang H.-C. Wagner G. Wang J.-H. Science. 1999; 286: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The yield of the CA/I-Ak is ∼0.7 mg/liter culture supernatant after affinity purification. On SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 b, lane 4), the purified CA/I-Ak migrates as two closely spaced bands, with apparent molecular masses of ∼35 kDa. N-terminal amino acid sequence determination verified that the upper band is the α chain and the lower one is the CA peptide fused β chain. Unlike with the other recombinant proteins, the apparent molecular mass mobility on SDS-PAGE of the I-Ak subunits is inconsistent with those predicted from amino acid sequences (α = 27,295 daltons and β = 30,908 daltons). These differences are due to post-translational modification (there are two N-linked glycosylation sites in the α chain and one in the β chain) as well as the highly charged leucine zipper sequences, resulting in anomalous migration on SDS-PAGE (32Kern P.

All four proteins can be concentrated to 1–2 mm with no aggregates observed by either light scattering or gel filtration (data not shown). Surface plasmon resonance was used to examine the binding affinity between the D10 TCR αβ heterodimer and CA/I-Akand, as a comparison, between the scD10 TCR and CA/I-Ak. To this end, the anti-LZ mAb 13A12 was immobilized on a CM5 sensorchip to a level of ∼8000 RU. The CA/I-Ak protein was captured (∼800 RU) through binding of the C-terminal LZ appended to the pMHCII, facilitating an orientation that exposes the pMHCII antigen-presenting platform to the TCR. pMHCII accessibility to immune recognition was first verified by injecting 0.5 μmanti-I-Ak mAb 10.2.16 (data not shown). Subsequently, the D10 αβ TCR and scD10 were individually injected as the analyte over the pMHC surface (Fig. 2, aand b, insets). Sensorgrams of the indicated concentrations of D10 and scD10 TCR binding to captured CA/I-Ak are shown in Fig. 2, a and b(main plots), respectively. For kinetic studies, data were fitted using a Langmuir 1:1 binding model, and similar dissociation constants (K d) of the two D10 TCRs binding to CA/I-Ak were acquired (see below). Moreover, consistent results were obtained independently by equilibrium studies (Fig. 2,c and d). Both direct nonlinear curve fitting and Scatchard plot analysis gave similar K d values. Fig.2 e summarizes the fitted kinetic and equilibrium data. Both D10 and scD10 TCRs show relatively fast association and dissociation rates when binding to CA/I-Ak. D10 binds to CA/I-Ak with a K d of 6.7 μm and a half-life of about 17.5 s. scD10 TCR shows a similar binding affinity to CA/I-Ak with aK d of 7.8 μm and a half-life of 12.5 s. The similarities in these binding parameters imply that the V domain module of the TCR alone is sufficient for pMHCII recognition. These values are within the range of those reported for other TCR-pMHCI and pMHCII interactions at 25 °C (37Davis M.M. Boniface J.J. Reich Z. Lyons D. Hampl J. Arden B. Chien Y. Annu. Rev.

To determine whether CD4 could influence the binding between the D10 TCR and its pMHCII ligand, the D10 TCR αβ heterodimer protein was mixed with different concentrations of soluble hCD4 and incubated overnight at 4 °C. In these experiments, the concentration of D10 TCR αβ protein was constant (20 μm), whereas the hCD4 concentration was varied from 0 to 100 μm, generating a series of “D10/CD4” molar ratios. The individual D10 or hCD4 components or alternatively, a mixture of the two at a given molar ratio was injected separately over the same 13A12 mAb-captured CA/I-Ak surface as described above.

We cloned and characterized cDNA encoding cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), which is a key enzyme of transsulfuration pathway, from a hemoflagellate protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. T. cruzi CBS, unlike mammalian CBS, lacks the regulatory carboxyl terminus, does not contain heme, and is not activated by S-adenosylmethionine. T. cruzi CBS mRNA is expressed as at least six independent isotypes with sequence microheterogeneity from tandemly linked multicopy genes. The enzyme forms a homotetramer and, in addition to CBS activity, the enzyme has serine sulfhydrylase and cysteine synthase (CS) activities in vitro. Expression of the T. cruzi CBS in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli demonstrates that the CBS and CS activities are functional in vivo. Enzymatic studies on T. cruzi extracts indicate that there is an additional CS enzyme and stage-specific control of CBS and CS expression. We also cloned and characterized cDNA encoding serine acetyltransferase (SAT), a key enzyme in the sulfate assimilatory cysteine biosynthetic pathway. Dissimilar to bacterial and plant SAT, a recombinant T. cruzi SAT showed allosteric inhibition by l-cysteine, l-cystine, and, to a lesser extent, glutathione. Together, these studies demonstrate the T. cruzi is a unique protist in possessing both transsulfuration and sulfur assimilatory pathways."

Two major isoforms of human merlin have been documented. Isoform I has 595 residues, resulting from translation of exons 1–15 and 17, and isoform II has 590 residues and is a translation of exons 1–16, replacing the last 16 residues from exon 17 of isoform I with 11 residues from exon 16 (4, 5). Insight into the possible roles of merlin have come in part from studies of mice and flies lacking merlin, as well as from the identification of merlin-binding proteins.

The three ERM family members are ∼580 residues long and share ∼75% sequence identity.

Among the proteins known to bind the N-terminal domain of ezrin in a regulated fashion is the PSD-95/DlgA/Z0-1-like domain-containing scaffolding protein EBP50 (an ERM-binding phosphoprotein of 50 kDa) (17Reczek D.

Activation of ERM proteins to unmask binding sites involves dissociation of the intramolecular N-/C-ERMAD, which can be achieved by phosphorylation of a threonine 20 residues from the C terminus in combination with specific inositol phospholipids (31Nakamura F.

The possibility that merlin might be subject to a similar regulatory mechanism has been investigated in a number of studies. In support of this possibility is the finding that the N-terminal half of merlin can associate in vitro with the C-terminal half of isoform I but not isoform II (6Sherman L. Xu H.M. Geist R.T.

Heiska L. Vaheri A. Carpen O. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 895-904PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, EBP50/human Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor binds better to merlin isoform II than to isoform I, suggesting that the C terminus is important in this intramolecular association (20Gonzalez-Agosti C. Wiederhold T. Herndon M.E. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34438-34442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the idea that merlin might be regulated by a mechanism equivalent to the N-/C-ERMAD associations was initially considered unlikely, as isoform I shares only 24% sequence identity with the ERMs over the region corresponding to the C-ERMAD. Therefore, we set out to determine whether the regions in the N- and C-terminal halves of merlin described above might be functionally analogous to the N- and C-ERMADs of the ERM proteins. Concurrently, the availability of the atomic structure of the moesin N-/C-ERMAD complex allowed us to use sequence alignments with merlin to examine whether isoform I was likely to have N- and C-ERMADs. Remarkably, the alignment showed that residues potentially on the N- and C-ERMAD interface were strongly conserved between merlin and the ERM proteins, thereby predicting a similar interaction for merlin (38Pearson M. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). During the completion of the present work, affinity coelectrophoresis studies reported a high affinity interaction between the N- and C-terminal halves of merlin and between the N-terminal half of merlin and the C-terminal half of moesin (20Gonzalez-Agosti C. Wiederhold T. Herndon M.E. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34438-34442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Analyses of homo- and heterotypic associations, as well as interactions involving the scaffolding proteins EBP50 and E3KARP, identify hierarchies of binding reactions between domains of these proteins. These studies allow us to demonstrate regulated interactions between merlin, ezrin, and their ligands that need to be integrated into any model for tumor suppression by merlin. Rabbit antisera to ezrin have been described (39Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Antisera to N-terminal domain (residues 1–313) of merlin were raised against purified recombinant protein in rabbits at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY). cDNA for full-length merlin was a kind gift from Dr. J. F. Gusella. MBP-E3KARP was a kind gift from Dr. C. H. Yun. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and fast protein liquid chromatography instrumentation was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The cloning of full-length ezrin (residues 1–586) and Ez-1–297 has been described (30Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The cDNA for merlin N-terminal domain was purchased from Genome Systems Inc. (St. Louis, MO). This cDNA was subcloned into expression vector pQE50 (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) by polymerase chain reaction amplification and restriction digest. The full cDNA for human merlin isoform I (JJR-1) in BlueScript II/SK– plasmid from Dr. J. F. Gusella was used to generate the full-length subclone of full-length merlin for inducible overexpression in E. coli. Briefly, the 1.2-kilobase pair fragment from the partial digest of clone JJR-1 with BamHI and HindIII, which contains the C-terminal half of merlin, was spliced to the N-terminal half of merlin in pQE50 at the 865 HindIII site of the coding sequence of merlin, and the 3′-end backbone of BSII/SK– was spliced to pQE50 at the BamHI site. The subclone, named JJRR-4 (JJR-1 recloned, colony 4), was checked by restriction digest and found to be free of errors by DNA sequencing. All pQE50-derived plasmids were propagated in JM109 strain of E. coli (Qiagen). The cloning and expression of the COOH-terminal GST fusion constructs of ezrin, GST-Ez-475–586 and GST-Ez-475–584, have been described (26Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal GST fusion constructs of merlin, GST-Mr-359–595ci (isoform I), GST-Mr-359–590cii (isoform II), GST-Mr-477–595, GST-Mr-477–593, GST-Mr-477–588, and GST-Mr-502–595 were made by polymerase chain reaction amplification of JJRR-4 plasmid at appropriate sites with 5′-BamHI and 3′-EcoRI overhangs and cloned into vector pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Polymerase chain reaction products were inserted into pCRII Topo TA vector (Invitrogen Inc., San Diego, CA), and fidelity was confirmed by sequencing. These merlin C-terminal polymerase chain reaction products were inserted into pGEX-3X vector at the BamHI and EcoRI sites. All pGEX-derived plasmids were propagated in DH5α. The cloning of GST-EBP50 (30Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and MBP-E3KARP (40Yun C.H. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) has been described. For expression, untagged full-length and NH2-terminal constructs of ezrin and merlin, Ez-1–586, Ez-1–297, Mr-1–595, and Mr-1–313 were propagated in E. coli strain M15[pREP4] (Qiagen). Bacteria were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. Freshly saturated overnight cultures were diluted 1:20 or 1:30 and grown with vigorous shaking at 37 °C for 90–120 min until A 595reached 0.6–0.8, at which point the culture was induced with 1.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) and allowed to grow for another 2–3 h. pGEX-derived plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21, grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Growth condition was the same as in M15 strain, except protein expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g and washed with 4 °C phosphate-buffered saline, and pellets were quick-frozen on dry ice/ethanol for later use. Full-length ezrin (Ez-1–586), Ez-1–297, Mr-1–595 and Mr-1–313 were purified from total bacterial extracts by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) over hydroxyapatite (HA-Ultragel; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) then S (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) Sepharose columns. Methods for purifying full-length ezrin and Ez-1–297 have been described (30Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Because expression level is ∼ 120 lower for full-length merlin and Mr-1–313, two bacteria pellets each from a 3-liter culture were used per preparation. One 3-liter pellet weighing ∼10 g was resuspended in 30 ml of lysozyme solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mg/ml lysozyme) by vortexing and was allowed to stand at room temperature for 10–15 min, after which time HA buffer B (0.8 mKH2PO4, pH 6.7, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 150 μg/ml benzamidine, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, lot 67H4105)) was added to a final concentration of 0.3 m KH2PO4. Cells were lysed by sonication (Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT), cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 27,000 ×g for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was loaded over a 10-ml bed volume of HA resin. The two pellets were processed and loaded sequentially. The column was developed using a 50-ml linear gradient of 0.3–0.8 m KH2PO4. Full-length merlin eluted at ∼0.6 mKH2PO4, and Mr-1–313 at ∼0.5 m. Peak HA fractions of full-length merlin or Mr-1–313 were pooled and dialyzed for 5 h against 60 volumes of Q (20 mmBis-Tris-propane, pH 6.7, 40 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) or S (20 mm MES, pH 6.7, 150 mmNaCl) buffer, respectively. Full-length merlin was eluted from the Q Sepharose column with a linear gradient of Q buffer containing 40–1000 mm NaCl, coming off at ∼0.5 m NaCl, and Mr-1–313 was eluted from an S Sepharose column with a linear gradient of S buffer containing 150–1000 mm NaCl, coming off at ∼0.7 m NaCl. Proteins purified off the ion exchange columns were dialyzed into coupling buffer (0.1 mNaHCO3, pH 8.3, 0.5 m NaCl) for covalent coupling to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol and as described (17Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding assays were performed in BA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 or 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% TX-100). 10 μl of beads, with 1–2 mg of protein coupled per ml, were used per reaction. The beads were equilibrated with 0.5 ml of BA buffer prior to the addition of normalized amounts of crude bacterial extract. BA buffer was added to each reaction tube to normalize the final volume to 0.5 ml. The beads were incubated in extract for 30–60 min, pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g, and washed 4–5 times in BA buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 30–50 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer for 2 min, and 10–20 μl were loaded for analysis by gel electrophoresis. For the mixing competition assays, bacterial extracts of the proteins of interest, normalized to contain equal amount of the induced proteins, were incubated together with protein coupled beads for 30–60 min. The beads were then pelleted and washed 4–5 times in BA buffer. One-third of the bound fraction was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For the challenge competition assays, beads were first incubated with a saturating amount of the first protein for 30–60 min, washed 4–5 times in BA buffer, and then challenged with the same amount of a second protein. All samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer and analyzed on 10 or 12% gels following standard protocols (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205478) Google Scholar). For Western blots, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) with a semidry transfer system (Integrated Separation Systems, Hyde Park, MA). Blots were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in rinse buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, incubated with 1:5,000 rabbit antisera in 1% milk followed by 1:10,000 peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) in 1% milk. Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Full-length merlin or ezrin was loaded onto a Superose 6 HR 10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 or 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min; 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The column was calibrated with conventional gel filtration standards (Sigma). Blue dextran was used to determine the void volume. Ezrin is regulated by an intramolecular association between the N- and C-ERMADs, and these domains have been mapped to residues 1–297 and 475–586, respectively (Fig.1 A) (26Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To determine whether merlin has analogous domains, and whether domains of ezrin can interact with domains of merlin, a number of ezrin and merlin constructs were utilized (Fig. 1 B). We have described several ezrin constructs that were used to define the N- and C-ERMADs as well as to demonstrate that the intramolecular interaction masks the F-actin and EBP50 binding sites in the full-length dormant molecule (26Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 30Reczek D. Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Among these (Fig. 1 B) were untagged ezrin N-ERMAD (Ez-1–297) and GST fusion proteins containing the ezrin C-ERMAD (GST-Ez-475–586) and the mutated C-ERMAD (GST-Ez-475–584) missing the last two residues. Equivalent and additional constructs for merlin were generated based on an alignment of the ERM and merlin protein sequences (38Pearson M. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Constructs were made to express untagged full-length merlin isoform I (Mr-1–595) and the N-terminal domain equivalent to the ezrin N-ERMAD, Mr-1–313. In addition, we generated constructs to express GST fusion proteins with the C-terminal regions of merlin isoforms I and II in which similarity to the ERMs significantly declines (GST-Mr-359–595ci and GST-Mr-359–590cii), as well as regions of merlin isoform I corresponding to the ezrin C-ERMAD (GST-Mr-477–595), ones lacking the last two residues (GST-Mr-477–593) or seven residues (GST-Mr-477–588), and a shorter C-terminal construct (GST-Mr-502–595). Expression of all of these constructs in bacteria resulted in readily identifiable bands corresponding to the induced proteins (Fig.1 C, asterisks), except for expression of full-length merlin (Mr-1–595) and Mr-1–313. These proteins were detected in immunoblots using antibodies directed against the N-terminal domain of merlin (Fig.1 D). Ezrin, but not merlin, runs anomalously slowly on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, and the region responsible is contained within the ezrin C-ERMAD (26Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Thus, although the GST-Ez-475–586 construct is seven residues shorter than GST-Mr-477–595, it runs with a much slower mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (compare Fig. 1 C, lanes 3 and 9, respectively). The purification of full-length natural or recombinant merlin has not been reported, and therefore the intact protein has not yet been characterized biochemically. To aid our studies, we developed methods for the purification of both untagged recombinant full-length merlin and its free NH2-terminal domain (Fig.2). Like ezrin (42Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 43Bretscher A. Gary R. Berryman M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16830-16837Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), merlin and its NH2-terminal domain bind to hydroxyapatite resins with high affinity. Immunoblot analysis revealed that full-length merlin in crude bacterial extracts bound quantitatively to this resin (data not shown) and could be eluted using a potassium phosphate gradient. Subsequent chromatography on Q Sepharose yielded the purified full-length protein (Fig.2 A). Likewise, the NH2-terminal domain (Mr-1–313) bound tightly to hydroxyapatite and could be obtained in a highly purified form after chromatography over S Sepharose (Fig.2 B), in a manner previously described for the ezrin N-ERMAD (17Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and shown in Fig. 2 C. The yield for each merlin construct was ∼0.5 mg/liter of bacterial culture, whereas for the ezrin N-ERMAD it was ∼10 mg/liter bacterial culture. To determine whether the C-terminal domain of merlin binds either the merlin or ezrin N-ERMAD, purified Ez-1–297 and Mr-1–313 were coupled to beads and used in pull-down assays. Beads were incubated with total soluble bacterial extracts expressing various constructs (shown in the summary diagram in Fig.3 D) and washed extensively, and bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. In all of these experiments, the same molar concentration of the ezrin or merlin N-terminal domain was immobilized on the beads and the bacterial extracts contained a large excess of recombinant protein to allow for the recovery of both tight and relatively weak interactions as a starting point for our analysis (Fig. 3 A). Both sets of beads bound the ezrin C-ERMAD (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1, GST-Ez-475–586), the C-terminal half of merlin isoform I (lanes 3, GST-Mr-359–595ci), and the C-terminal region of merlin corresponding to the ezrin C-ERMAD (GST-Mr-477–595). The C-terminal half of merlin isoform II (lanes 4,GST-Mr-359–590cii) and the merlin constructs lacking the last two or seven residues (GST-Mr-477–593 and GST-Mr-477–588) did not bind either set of beads (lanes 6 and 7). Thus, the C-terminal region of merlin isoform I, but not of isoform II, binds the N-terminal domains of ez"

Here we characterize the effect of GR DNA binding domain (DBD) mutations, previously analyzed for changes in the ability to activate gene expression or transrepress AP-1. We have identified a GR mutant capable of distinguishing between transrepression of NF-κB and AP-1. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that this mutation does not appreciably alter GR DBD conformation, suggesting that functional differences between the mutant and wild type protein are the result of an alteration of a specific interaction surface. These data suggest that transrepression of NF-κB and AP-1 occurs through distinct protein-protein interactions and argue against the hypothesis that transrepression occurs through competition for a single coactivator protein. Introduction of these mutations into GC-resistant CEM lymphoblastic T cells restored dexamethasone (DEX)-mediated apoptosis as did wild type GR regardless of whether these mutants were transrepression or activation defective. Thus, DEX-mediated apoptosis in transformed T cells is more complex than originally appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2010645034,"A nonhistone chromosomal protein, high mobility group (HMG) 1, is ubiquitous in higher eukaryotic cells and binds preferentially to cisplatin-modified DNA. HMG1 also functions as a coactivator of p53, a tumor suppressor protein. We investigated physical interactions between HMG1 and p53 and the influence of p53 on the ability of HMG1 to recognize damaged DNA. Using immunochemical coprecipitation, we observed binding of HMG1 and p53. Interaction between HMG1 and p53 required the HMG A box of HMG1 and amino acids 363–376 of p53. Cisplatin-modified DNA binding by HMG1 was significantly enhanced by p53. An HMG1-specific antibody that recognized the A box of this protein also stimulated cisplatin-modified DNA binding. These data suggest that an interaction with either p53 or antibody may induce conformational change in the HMG1 A box that optimizes DNA binding by HMG1. Interaction of p53 with HMG1 after DNA damage may promote activation of specific HMG1 binding to damaged DNAin vivo and provide a molecular link between DNA damage and p53-mediated DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W2009064016,"The protein specified by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear gene PET111 specifically activates translation of the mitochondrially coded mRNA for cytochromec oxidase subunit II (Cox2p). We found Pet111p specifically in mitochondria of both wild-type cells and cells expressing a chromosomal gene for a functional epitope-tagged form of Pet111p. Pet111p was associated with mitochondrial membranes and was highly resistant to extraction with alkaline carbonate. Pet111p was protected from proteolytic digestion by the mitochondrial inner membrane. Thus, it is exposed only on the matrix side, where it could participate directly in organellar translation and localize Cox2p synthesis by virtue of its functional interaction with the COX2 mRNA 5′-untranslated leader. We also found that Pet111p is present at levels limiting the synthesis of Cox2p by examining the effect of alteredPET111 gene dosage in the nucleus on expression of a reporter gene, cox2::ARG8 m, that was inserted into mitochondrial DNA.

Myers A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 249-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 2Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the activity of mitochondrial genetic systems must be coordinated with cellular gene expression and adapted for efficient delivery of hydrophobic proteins to the inner membrane. Translation of at least five of the seven major Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrially coded mRNAs is under the control of mRNA-specific activator proteins encoded by nuclear genes (4Fox T.D. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 733-758Google Scholar). Genetic analysis has revealed that the activator proteins functionally interact with the 5′-UTLs1 of their target mRNAs and probably mediate productive interactions between those mRNAs and ribosomes (4Fox T.D. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 733-758Google Scholar, 5Green-Willms N.S. Fox T.D. Costanzo M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1826-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As discussed below, several of the activator proteins have been found to be associated with mitochondrial membranes, suggesting that they could function to localize the synthesis of hydrophobic mitochondrial gene products to their sites of insertion in the inner membrane (3Grivell L.A.

This hypothesis is strongly supported by the fact that the untranslated regions of the COX2 and COX3 mRNAs contain information that facilitates correct targeting of the Cox2p and Cox3p cytochrome oxidase subunits (8Sanchirico M.E. Fox T.D. Mason T.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5796-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The translational activator proteins themselves are present at low levels (9Fox T.D. Experientia. 1996; 52: 1130-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and have therefore been difficult to study. In no case have they been shown to be localized within mitochondria isolated from wild-type (nonoverproducing) cells such that they could participate directly in organellar protein synthesis. Cbs1p and Cbs2p, activators required for translation of the cytochrome b mRNA (10Rödel G. Curr. Genet. 1986; 11: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), were detectable at normal levels in wild-type cells. They were found associated with the total mitochondrial membrane fraction. Cbs1p behaved like an integral membrane protein, whereas Cbs2p was peripherally associated, but they were not further localized within the organelle (6Michaelis U. Körte A. Rödel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Pet309p, required for Cox1p translation (11Manthey G.M. McEwen J.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4031-4043Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), could only be detected as an epitope-tagged species in cells overproducing the protein (12Manthey G.M. Przybyla-Zawislak B.D. McEwen J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Under these conditions it fractionated as an integral inner membrane protein, partially exposed on the outer surface (intermembrane space side). Mss51p, also required for Cox1p synthesis, was peripherally associated with mitoplast (mitochondria with ruptured outer membranes) membranes when expressed from a low-copy plasmid (13Siep M. van Oosterum K. Neufeglise H. van der Spek H. Grivell L.A. Curr. Genet. 2000; 37: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Synthesis of Cox3p requires three interacting proteins, Pet54p, Pet122p, and Pet494p (14Costanzo M.C. Fox T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2677-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Brown N.G. Costanzo M.C. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Only Pet54p could be detected immunologically in wild-type cells and was found to be peripherally associated with the inner membrane (16McMullin T.W. Fox T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11737-11741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pet122p and Pet494p, when overproduced, fractionated as integral inner membrane proteins (16McMullin T.W. Fox T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11737-11741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mRNA-specific activators could regulate expression of mitochondrial genes in addition to targeting synthesis on the membrane if they were present at levels limiting translation. Alternatively, the activators could be present in excess, with regulation of mitochondrial gene expression controlled at some other step. This has been examined to date only in the case of COX3 expression using the synthetic reporter gene ARG8 m inserted into mtDNA at COX3 (17Steele D.F. Butler C.A. Fox T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5253-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Reduction of the gene dosage ofPET494 caused reduced expression of the mitochondrial reporter, although increased dosage of PET494 caused only a modest increase in reporter expression. In this study we have focussed on Pet111p, the only known translational activator for the COX2 mRNA (18Poutre C.G. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1987; 115: 637-647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mulero J.J. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1993; 133: 509-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pet111p is known to be mitochondrially located (20Strick C.A. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2728-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and to interact functionally with the COX2 mRNA 5′-UTL (21Mulero J.J. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1327-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although the amino acid sequence of Pet111p is not highly conserved among budding yeasts, its function in specifically activating translation of the COX2mRNA has been conserved, indicating an important role in the production of cytochrome c oxidase (22Costanzo M.C. Bonnefoy N. Williams E.H. Clark-Walker G.D. Fox T.D. Genetics. 2000; 154: 999-1012PubMed Google Scholar). Here we study the submitochondrial localization of Pet111p in cells expressing thePET111 gene at normal levels and examine the effect of altered PET111 gene dosage on expression of the mitochondrial COX2 gene. Our results are consistent with a direct role for Pet111p in localization of mitochondrial translation and demonstrate that it is a rate-limiting factor in the expression of the COX2 gene. S. cerevisiaestrains used in this study are listed in TableI. All strains are congenic to the wild-type strain D273–10B (ATCC 25657) except DFS160rho0, HMD122, and NSG175, which were derived from DBY947 (23Neff N.F. Thomas J.H. Grisafi P. Botstein D.

Tokiwa G. Nash R. Futcher B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1773-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) at its 3′ end using the plasmid pCS124 (obtained from C. Shamu and J. Nunnari), an integrative plasmid carrying three copies of the HA sequence and the TRP1 gene. The downstream 556 base pairs of PET111 were inserted as anEcoRI-NcoI fragment into pCS124 such that the epitope-coding sequence was in-frame with PET111. The resulting plasmid, pNSG30, was cut at a unique HpaI site within PET111 and used to transform strain PTY11 to Trp+. In the resulting integrative transformant, NSG91, the only complete copy of PET111 was the tagged allele,PET111-HA. Correct integration was confirmed by Southern analysis. Mitochondria were prepared from cells grown to late exponential phase in complete medium (yeast extract/peptone) containing 2% galactose as described (29Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), except that spheroplasts were disrupted using a Parr-Bomb (Parr Instrument Co., Moline, IL) as described previously (30Dake E. Hofmann T.J. McIntire S. Hudson A. Zassenhaus H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7691-7702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crude mitochondria were purified by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation on 5–25% Nycodenz (5-(N-2,3-dihydroxypropylacetamido)-2,4,6-triiodo-N,N′-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl) isophthalimide; Sigma) step gradients as described (29Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were separated into membrane and soluble fractions as described (31Glick B.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and alkaline carbonate extractions of membranes in 0.1 mNa2CO3, pH 11.5, were as described (32Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Soluble fractions were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Mitochondria were converted to mitoplasts by diluting 10-fold into 20 mmK+-HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin containing either 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or 100 μg/ml proteinase K and incubated on ice for 30 min (31Glick B.S.

Fractions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels and Western-blotted as described (34Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The C-terminal 542-amino acid fragment of Pet111p was isolated as a GST-Pet111p fusion protein encoded by pJAM6 (35Mulero J.J. Studies on the Translation of the Yeast Mitochondrial COX2 mRNA with Emphasis on Its Translational Activator PET111.Ph.D. thesis. Cornell University, 1993Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies were isolated after induction in Escherichia coli (BL21) with 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-μ-d-galactopyranoside, and the GST-Pet111p fusion protein was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Rabbits were immunized and serum-prepared as described previously (34Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Immune serum (5-165) was treated with acetone powder from a pet111Δ strain (34Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), purified on a DEAE Affi-Gel blue column (Bio-Rad), and used at a 1:1000 dilution.

Mitochondria were purified from cells with the chromosomally integrated PET111-HA gene (NSG91), grown to late logarithmic phase in complete galactose medium (“Experimental Procedures”) and 50-μg aliquots of total mitochondrial protein (T), and submitochondrial fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Mitochondria were separated into soluble (S) and membrane (M) fractions (“Experimental Procedures”). Membranes were further extracted with alkaline carbonate (“Experimental Procedures”) to separate peripheral membrane proteins (PM) from integral membrane proteins (IM). The Western blots were probed with anti-HA to detect Pet111p-HA as well as antisera against inner membrane-bound Cox2p and the soluble matrix enzyme Arg8p (encoded by the wild-type nuclearARG8 gene in this strain).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Pet111p is an inner membrane protein facing the matrix. Mitochondria (M) were purified from thePET111-HA strain NSG91 and converted to mitoplasts (MP) by osmotic shock in the absence or presence of proteinase K, as indicated for each lane (“Experiment Procedures”). Mitochondria were also treated with proteinase K in the presence of the detergent octyl glucoside (1%) to solubilize membranes. Treated samples were analyzed by Western blots probed with anti-HA to detect Pet111p-HA as well as antisera against the soluble matrix enzyme α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (αKDH) , the inner membrane-bound protein Yme1p exposed on the outer surface, and the soluble intermembrane space protein cytochrome (cyt)b2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For quantitative Western analysis, cells were harvested at mid-log phase, and total protein was isolated as described (37Yaffe M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis in 12% polyacrylamide and then transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 5% ECF blocking compound (Vistra) in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Tween 20, washed in Tris-buffered saline, and then incubated with the primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Tween 20 either at 25 °C for 1 h or overnight at 4 °C. The filters were next washed in Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with secondary antibody in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at 25 °C. The secondary antibody was fluorescein-linked donkey anti-rabbit Ig (Vistra) diluted 1:250 for anti-Arg8p and 1:125 for anti-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The membranes were then washed in Tris-buffered saline and allowed to dry at room temperature for at least 20 min before scanning on a Molecular Dynamics STORM 840 PhosphorImager (Blue Fluorescence/Chemi-fluorescence screen, 100 μm, photomultiplier tube voltage 650). Membranes were probed first with anti-Arg8p antiserum (17Steele D.F. Butler C.A. Fox T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5253-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) that had been purified on a DEAE Affi-Gel Blue column (Bio-Rad) and treated with acetone powder (34Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) derived from anarg8Δ yeast strain. After scanning, blots were stripped with 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 62.4 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.7 at 50 °C for 30 min, washed extensively with Tris-buffered saline, dried at room temperature, and scanned to check for removal of the Arg8p antibody. Blots were then reprobed with anti-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase polyclonal antiserum (Sigma) diluted 1:125. Scanned images were analyzed using ImageQuant version 1.1 software from Molecular Dynamics. Area, the summation of pixel intensity times the number of pixels, was quantitated for the desired bands. Each Arg8p signal was normalized to the corresponding G6PD signal. The plasmid pHD6 was constructed in the vector pTZ18u (Bio-Rad). It contains the ARG8 m sequence (17Steele D.F. Butler C.A. Fox T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5253-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) (see GenBankTM accession U31093) flanked by 0.57 kilobases of mitochondrial DNA upstream of the COX2 reading frame and 0.81 kilobases of mitochondrial DNA downstream of the COX2reading frame. The sequence immediately downstream of theARG8 m stop codon contains an artificialBamHI site for cloning purposes. In addition, pHD6 contains a 0.75-kilobase PacI-MboI COX3fragment inserted between the BamHI and HincII site of the polylinker to serve as an additional mitochondrial genetic marker. The sequence of pHD6 is available upon request. pHD6 was introduced into the ρ0 mitochondria of strain DFS160rho0 (17Steele D.F. Butler C.A. Fox T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5253-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) by microprojectile bombardment as described (38Wiesenberger G. Costanzo M.C. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3291-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 39Bonnefoy, N., and Fox, T. D. (2001) Methods Cell Biol., 65, in press.Google Scholar), and mitochondrial transformants were identified by their ability to marker rescue the cox3–10 mutation (40Costanzo M.C. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4806-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). One such transformant, HMD122, was isolated and used to transfer pHD6 into ρ+ mitochondria by mating to appropriate strains and selecting Arg+ haploid cytoductants. Pet111p is expressed at very low levels (9Fox T.D. Experientia. 1996; 52: 1130-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and we have previously not been able to detect the protein in wild-type cells (21Mulero J.J. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1327-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Yeast cells overproducing Pet111p accumulate it in mitochondria, associated with membranes. 2C. A. Strick and T. D. Fox, unpublished data. However, firm conclusions regarding localization of a protein cannot be drawn from analysis of cells overproducing it. We therefore sought to improve the sensitivity of Pet111p detection. A new rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against a fusion protein bearing the C-terminal 542 Pet111p amino acid residues and glutathioneS-transferase, expressed in E. coli(“Experimental Procedures”). This serum was used to probe subcellular fractions from a wild-type strain (PTY11) on a Western blot. It reacted with a protein of the size expected for Pet111p (94 kDa) that was highly enriched in gradient-purified mitochondria and absent from post-mitochondrial supernatant (Fig.1 A). This protein was not detected in fractions isolated from a pet111 deletion mutant (Fig. 1) nor in wild-type fractions probed with pre-immune serum (not shown). Furthermore, the level of this protein was increased severalfold relative to total mitochondrial protein in the wild-type strain containing the multicopy plasmid pJM20, which carries a genomic fragment including the PET111 promoter and transcription terminator (26Mulero J.J. Fox T.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Cross-reacting species of ∼56 kDa, which may include Pet111p degradation products, were also detected (not shown). In addition, we were able to detect Pet111p as a tagged protein bearing three copies of the HA epitope, expressed from its chromosomal locus. Such strains were fully Pet+, demonstrating that Pet111p-HA is a functional protein. Mitochondria were purified from a strain expressing Pet111p-HA and from a wild-type strain and were probed with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody and with anti-Pet111p (Fig.1 B). The anti-HA antibody reacted with a protein of the appropriate size in the tagged mitochondria but not in the corresponding wild-type mitochondria. The anti-Pet111p reacted with the same protein in both samples, confirming that the species in question is indeed Pet111p. To determine the location of Pet111p within the mitochondria, submitochondrial fractions were prepared from a strain expressing Pet111p-HA (NSG91). Purified mitochondria were disrupted by osmotic shock and sonication, then fractionated by centrifugation to separate soluble and membrane-associated proteins. The membrane fraction was then extracted with alkaline sodium carbonate to separate peripheral membrane proteins from integral membrane proteins. The resulting fractions were then analyzed by Western blots probed with anti-HA to determine the distribution of Pet111p-HA. Most of the Pet111p-HA was recovered in the membrane pellet after sonication (Fig.2). Most of the membrane-associated Pet111p-HA remained with the integral membrane protein fraction after alkaline extraction, indicating that Pet111p is firmly membrane-bound. The known integral membrane protein Cox2p was completely associated with membranes in this experiment, whereas the soluble matrix protein Arg8p was not. Protease protection experiments were used to determine the submitochondrial location of Pet111p-HA (Fig.3). Proteinase K treatment of mitochondria solubilized by detergent eliminated detectable Pet111p-HA, showing that the epitope is not protected by a stable protein complex. However, Pet111p-HA in both whole mitochondria and in mitoplasts (osmotically shocked to rupture the outer membrane only) was protected from digestion by proteinase K. Thus, the C-terminal epitope appears to be on the inside of the inner membrane. Furthermore, since no shorter species were detected, it appears that the entire Pet111p-HA protein is protected from protease by the inner membrane. The same behavior was observed for the soluble matrix marker α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (Fig. 3). Yme1p is an integral inner membrane protein exposed on the outer surface of the inner membrane (41Leonhard K. Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Mannhaupt G. Neupert W. Langer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4218-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and is not protected from protease by mitoplasts, as expected (Fig. 3). Taken together, these data indicate that Pet111p is tightly associated with the inner surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Expression of the mitochondrialCOX2 gene could be limited at the level of translation by the activity of Pet111p. To examine this possibility, we constructed acox2::ARG8 m reporter gene that had the second codon of ARG8 m fused to theCOX2 translation initiation codon and lacked all otherCOX2 codons (“Experimental Procedures”). This reporter was inserted into mitochondrial DNA, cleanly replacing theCOX2 open reading frame with ARG8 m. The resulting chimeric gene specifies an mRNA with the Pet111p target in the COX2 5′-UTL, upstream of theARG8 m-coding sequence, followed by theCOX2 3′-untranslated region. Expression of this mitochondrial reporter gene fully complemented the Arg− growth phenotype caused by a nuclear arg8 mutation. This complementation was abolished by a pet111 nuclear mutation, demonstrating that cox2::ARG8m expression is Pet111p-dependent. As expected, the pet111mutation prevented accumulation of immunologically detectable Arg8p encoded by the mitochondrial reporter (not shown). To ask whether the level ofcox2::ARG8 m mRNA translation was limited by the level of Pet111p, we constructed strains containing the mitochondrial reporter with different dosages of thePET111 nuclear gene. We then measured the relative steady-state levels of Arg8p in whole cell extracts by quantitative Western blotting (“Experimental Procedures”). Measurements of Arg8p were internally controlled by normalization to the similarly measured steady-state level of the cytoplasmic enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Expression of the gene encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, ZWF1, appears to be relatively constant under different growth conditions (42DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3673) Google Scholar, 43Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene. 1990; 96: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). First, the dosage of PET111 was halved by constructing a diploid strain heterozygous for a pet111 mutation. The level of Arg8p reporter protein in this pet111/PET111 strain was approximately half that of a control strain homozygous for wild-type copies of PET111, as would be expected if Pet111p levels limit COX2 mRNA translation (Fig.4). As a control for mRNA specificity, we also examined the effect oncox2::ARG8 m expression of lowering the gene dosage of PET494, which encodes a subunit of theCOX3 mRNA-specific translational activator (15Brown N.G. Costanzo M.C. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and is limiting for cox3::ARG8 m expression (17Steele D.F. Butler C.A. Fox T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5253-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Arg8p levels were not decreased in thepet494Δ/PET494 heterozygous diploid relative to the homozygous wild-type strain but instead appeared to be slightly increased (Fig. 4). We next examined the effect of increasing PET111 gene dosage on the expression of the cox2::ARG8 mreporter gene. The multicopy PET111 plasmid pJM20 (26Mulero J.J. Fox T.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was transformed into a homozygous wild-type diploid strain. The steady-state level of Arg8p present in this transformant was determined relative to that of the same strain transformed with the empty vector YEp352 (44Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). The presence of extra copies of PET111 caused the steady-state level of Arg8p to increase by ∼2.8-fold (Fig.5), confirming that Pet111p activity is a limiting factor in the expression of the mitochondrial COX2gene. S. cerevisiae Pet111p is synthesized in the cytoplasm as an 800-amino acid protein, which may be processed upon entry into mitochondria. It is largely hydrophilic and has a net positive charge. Previous genetic data have argued for a close functional interaction between Pet111p and the COX2 mRNA in the mitochondrial matrix, where translation occurs. Here, we have detected Pet111p in mitochondria of cells expressing it at normal levels and demonstrated that it is tightly associated with the inner membrane. Pet111p is protected by the inner membrane from added protease, indicating that its hydrophilic domains must be exposed on the matrix side where they could interact with the COX2 mRNA and components of the organellar translation system. Thus, Pet111p is very likely to be the membrane component that recognizes targeting information in the untranslated portions of the COX2 mRNA, promoting efficient cytochrome c oxidase assembly (8Sanchirico M.E. Fox T.D. Mason T.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5796-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Pet111p was largely resistant to removal from mitochondrial membranes by extraction with alkaline carbonate, suggesting that it is an integral membrane protein (32Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). However, it was not as firmly bound as the known integral membrane protein Cox2p. Although analysis of theS. cerevisiae Pet111p sequence using the algorithm TMAP suggests two possible transmembrane helical domains (125 - 146 and 548–564), the more robust analysis, with the same program, of aligned Pet111p homologs from three budding yeasts (22Costanzo M.C. Bonnefoy N. Williams E.H. Clark-Walker G.D. Fox T.D. Genetics. 2000; 154: 999-1012PubMed Google Scholar) does not suggest any such domains (45Persson B. Argos P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 46Persson B. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The Pet122p subunit of the COX3mRNA-specific activator behaves as an integral membrane protein both when overproduced (16McMullin T.W. Fox T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11737-11741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and when expressed from a single chromosomal gene. 3C. A. Butler and T. D. Fox, unpublished data. Yet Pet122p also lacks apparent transmembrane helical domains and residues exposed to proteolysis on the outer surface of the inner membrane.3 This behavior contrasts with that of overproduced Pet309p, the COX1 mRNA-specific activator, that spans the inner membrane and is accessible to protease from the outside (12Manthey G.M. Przybyla-Zawislak B.D. McEwen J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The amount of Pet111p appears to limit expression of the mitochondrial gene COX2 at the level of translation, since the level of Arg8p encoded by a cox2::ARG8 mreporter gene varied with PET111 gene dosage. The reduction of Arg8p was clearly proportional to PET111 dosage when we reduced the number of PET111 genes by half. The Arg8p level increased 2.8-fold when PET111 was introduced into cells on a multicopy vector that caused an approximately similar increase in the level of Pet111p. This result is consistent with a previous report that the COX2 mRNA level is not limiting for gene expression since overexpression of that mRNA does not lead to increased synthesis of Cox2p (47Pinkham J.L. Dudley A.M. Mason T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We conclude that modulation of the level of Pet111p and/or its translational activation activity could regulate the level of Cox2p synthesis within mitochondria. Increased activity of a limiting translational activator will increase translation of the target mitochondrial mRNA up to the point that some other component (mRNA, ribosomes, etc.) becomes limiting. We cannot be certain whether this point was reached in our overproduction experiments. However, we did not greatly exceed it since the increase in Pet111p levels in mitochondria from cells with increasedPET111 dosage was approximately similar to the 2.8-fold increase in reporter gene expression. In a previous study ofcox3::ARG8 m expression we found that overproduction of the limiting activator subunit, Pet494p, increased the mitochondrial reporter expression only by ∼65% (17Steele D.F.

The possibility of competition between translational activators for low levels of some general translation component is suggested by the apparent slight increase incox2::ARG8 m expression in a diploid heterozygous for a pet494 deletion, but this effect may not be significant. The PET111 mRNA has an unusually long 5′-UTL of 470 nucleotides that contains four overlapping open reading frames upstream of the Pet111p-coding sequence (20Strick C.A. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2728-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility thatPET111 expression itself might be controlled at the level of cytoplasmic translation (48Hinnebusch A.G. Liebman S.W. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Genome Dynamics, Protein Synthesis, and Energetics. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 627-735Google Scholar). Such an mRNA structure could serve either as a target for regulation that limits gene expression independently of mRNA levels via feedback, or it could simply reduce the translational efficiency of the PET111 mRNA. The fact that increased copy number of the PET111 gene causes an increase in Pet111p levels and activity demonstrates Pet111p synthesis is not translationally limited independently of the mRNA level. However, we have not established whether the protein and mRNA levels vary proportionately.

Our results show that Pet111p is very likely to play roles in both regulating the rate of Cox2p synthesis and localizing that synthesis on the surface of the inner membrane. Thus, Pet111p could participate in a feedback mechanism coupling Cox2p translation with its assembly into the cytochrome c oxidase complex. We gratefully thank T. L. Mason, B. Glick, and G.

Despite strong evolutionary conservation of the globular domains of glypicans, no function has yet been attributed to them. By using a novel quantitative approach for assessing proteoglycan glycosylation, we show here that removal of the globular domain from rat glypican-1 converts the proteoglycan from one that bears ∼90% heparan sulfate (HS) to one that bears ∼90% chondroitin sulfate. Mutational analysis shows that sequences at least 70 amino acids away from the glypican-1 GAG attachment site are required for preferential HS assembly, although more nearby sequences also play a role. The effects of the glypican-1 globular domain on HS assembly could also be demonstrated by fusing this domain to sequences representing the GAG attachment sites of other proteoglycans or, surprisingly, simply by expressing the isolated globular domain in cells and analyzing effects either on an exogenously expressed glypican-1 GAG attachment domain or on endogenous proteoglycans. Quantitative analysis of the effect of the globular domain on GAG addition to proteoglycan core proteins suggested that preferential HS assembly is achieved, at least in part, through the inhibition of chondroitin sulfate assembly. These data identify the glypican-1 globular domain as a structural motif that potently influences GAG class determination and suggest that an important role of glypican globular domains is to ensure a high level of HS substitution of these proteoglycans.

Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). In most cases, the biological activities of PGs depend on the molecular interactions of their covalently attached glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. The major GAGs that are found on PGs, heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), 2In this report we treat dermatan sulfate as a subset of CSs, since the former is simply a highly epimerized variant of the latter, and epimerization takes place at a later biosynthetic stage than the ones considered here. are both synthesized via similar routes, involving the stepwise addition of monosaccharides to the side chain of a Ser residue N-terminal to a Gly residue. HS and CS both begin with the same tetrasaccharide moiety, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-Ser. To the terminal GlcUA is attached either α-GlcNAc or β-GalNAc, depending on whether HS or CS, respectively, is to be synthesized. Subsequently, copolymerases elongate HS or CS backbones through the repetitive addition of GlcUA and the appropriate N-acetylhexosamine, and other modification reactions, sulfation and epimerization, add complexity and functionality to the chains (1Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar, 2Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. Lyon M. Int. J.

As HS and CS have divergent structures and distinct biochemical properties, it is important that cells appropriately regulate which GAGs they attach to different PG core proteins. Based on the biosynthetic scheme just described, whether a PG carries HS or CS should be governed by either the accessibility or activity of the two enzymes, termed α-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I and β-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase I (β-GalNAc-TI), that are capable of adding the fifth sugar onto the common GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1 “linkage” tetrasaccharide (4Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Rohrmann K. Niemann R. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Clearly, much of the information that regulates this step must be encoded in the PG core protein, since cells that are capable of making both types of GAGs reliably place the correct ones onto appropriate core proteins. For example, cores that bear HS include glypicans, syndecans, perlecan, and agrin; cores that bear CS include members of the aggrecan and decorin families, among others. Some PGs, such as syndecan-1, commonly possess both HS and CS at different sites on the protein (6Inki P. Gomez M. Quintanilla M. Cano A. Jalkanen M. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 225-233PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kokenyesi R. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12304-12309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas others, such as serglycin, bear either CS or HS, depending upon the cell type in which they are expressed (8Uhlin-Hansen L. Kusche-Gullberg M. Berg E. Eriksson I. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3200-3206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,9Toyama-Sorimachi N. Kitamura F. Habuchi H. Tobita Y. Kimata K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26714-26719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Finally, some core proteins may be produced as a mixture of molecules possessing and lacking GAGs, or may lack GAGs entirely in some cell types. Recent data suggest that such “naked” core proteins actually possess the GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1 linkage tetrasaccharide at their GAG attachment sites (10Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33728-33734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Accordingly, they may be referred to as glycosylated but not glycanated (i.e. not GAG-extended). Attempts to elucidate signal elements in PG core proteins that regulate glycanation have focused attention on amino acid sequences close to GAG attachment sites. Zhang and co-workers (11Zhang L. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19295-19299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zhang L. David G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27127-27135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) fused short segments (typically <30 amino acids) of the core proteins of various PGs to the IgG-binding domain of protein A and expressed these constructs, and various mutant and chimeric forms of them, in mammalian cells. The secreted fusion proteins were then isolated and analyzed for their proportion of HS versus CS. From these studies it was concluded that particular sequence elements act as important enhancers of HS biosynthesis, such that in the absence of such elements glycanation with CS greatly predominated. The elements that favored HS formation included having two or more Ser-Gly dipeptides in close proximity to each other, having a nearby (within 10 amino acids) cluster of acidic amino acids, and having a tryptophan residue immediately following a Ser-Gly GAG attachment site. Some of the same HS-enhancing elements have also been reported by others (e.g. see Ref. 13Dolan M. Horchar T. Rigatti B. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4316-4322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although it is likely that the motifs elucidated by such studies play important roles in enhancing HS assembly on intact PGs, it is noteworthy that such elements are not sufficient to drive efficient glycanation with HS. In the studies of Zhang and co-workers (11Zhang L. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19295-19299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zhang L. David G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27127-27135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), for example, even the fusion proteins with the most favorable sequences rarely carried more than 60% of their GAG as HS. In contrast, several types of PGs are often glycanated exclusively with HS in vivo. A particularly striking example is the cell surface PG glypican-1. It appears to carry purely HS in vivo (14Litwack E.D. Ivins J.K. Kumbasar A. Paine-Saunders S. Stipp C.S. Lander A.D. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 211: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Lories V. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1116-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yet a protein A fusion containing a 24-amino acid fragment derived from the glypican-1 GAG attachment region carried only 20% HS (12Zhang L. David G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27127-27135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This result was obtained despite the fact that this 24-amino acid region contains three consecutive Ser-Gly dipeptides and two nearby clusters of acidic amino acids. Such findings imply that PG core proteins must contain, outside of their immediate GAG attachment sites, information that regulates glycanation. In the case of glypican-1, such information must be particularly important for determining whether HS or CS is produced. Glypican core proteins, of which six have been identified in vertebrates, two in Drosophila, and one inCaenorhabditis elegans (17Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar), share a unique, highly conserved structure, in which a large N-terminal globular domain containing 14 cysteine residues is followed by a GAG attachment domain that includes multiple Ser-Gly dipeptide sites and finally a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor that tethers the molecule to the plasma membrane. To date, no binding properties or biochemical activities have been attributed to the N-terminal globular domain of glypicans, despite the fact that these domains display a high degree of sequence conservation both among animal species and between glypican family members. In the present study we demonstrate that the N-terminal globular domain of glypican-1 is a potent enhancer of preferential HS glycanation, capable of driving the glypican-1 GAG attachment domain to assemble HS almost exclusively. We further show that the glypican-1 globular domain can shift the balance of HS glycanation on other GAG attachment domains to which it is experimentally fused and, surprisingly, even on PGs to which it is not fused but is simply coexpressed. Finally, we provide data suggesting that the mechanism by which the globular domain promotes HS assembly involves inhibition of the initiation of CS chains. COS-7 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL-61, Manassas, VA). COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Salt Lake City, UT), and CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 7.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Both cell types were grown with penicillin G (100 units/ml) and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were passaged every 3–4 days. The vectorAPtag-6His was produced by transferring theHindIII to XbaI fragment from theAPtag-2 vector (18Cheng H.J. Nakamoto M. Bergemann A.D. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 1995; 82: 371-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) containing the AP coding sequence followed by the APtag-2 polylinker sequence into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Next, a segment encoding the peptide sequence RGSHHHHHH, followed by a termination codon, was produced by annealing the oligonucleotides 5′-ATCGTGGTTCTCATCACCATCACCATCACTAACTCGAG-3′ and 5′CTCGAGTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGAGAACCACGAT-3′. This fragment was inserted into the unique HpaI site at the end of the AP coding sequence. This insertion interrupts the native AP termination codon and thus allows translation through the polyhistidine tag. This construct and all subsequent constructs were sequenced to confirm their identity. The plasmid encoding GPC(N1/N2/G)-AP was produced by isolating nucleotides 9–1459 of rat glypican-1 cDNA (see Ref. 19Litwack E.D. Stipp C.S. Kumbasar A. Lander A.D. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3713-3724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession number L34067) with BamHI and NarI. The segment containing nucleotides 1459–1641 was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-1449CGTTTACGTGGCGCC-3′ and 5′-1641CGGGATCCGGTCTTCTGTCCCTC-3′. The PCR product was digested with NarI and BamHI. The released glypican-1 fragment and the PCR fragment were subsequently inserted, in the proper orientation, into the BglII site ofAPtag-6His. The plasmid encoding GPC(N1/N2)-AP was generated with two PCR products amplified from APtag-6His/GPC(N1/N2/G)-AP. The first PCR product was generated with 5′-1300TGGAATGGGATTTCCAA-3′ and 5′-ATCGCCACCGTAGGCGCCACG-3′(the fourth nucleotide of this sequence corresponds to position 1473 of native glypican-1) and digested with KpnI. The second PCR product was generated from the AP coding sequence with 5′-ATCAGATCTATCATCCCAGTTGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-GGAAAATCCTAGGACCGT-3′ and digested with BamHI. Both fragments, when joined at their blunt ends, generate anEcoRV site at the junction between glypican-1 and AP. The digested PCR products were ligated withAPtag-6His/GPC(N1/N2/G)-AP that had previously been cut withKpnI and BamHI. The plasmid encoding GPC(G)-AP was constructed by replacing theNotI to NarI segment from the glypican-1 coding region of APtag-6His/GPC(N1/N2/G)-AP with an adapter sequence, generated by annealing 5′-GGCCGCCGCGCTAGTCGCCTGCGCCCGCGGGGACCCCGCCAGCAAGGG-3′ and 5′-CGCCCTTGCTGGCGGGGTCCCCGCGGGGCGCAGGCGACTAGCGCGGC-3′. This adapter sequence replaces a small part of the signal peptide that was excised in the NotI to NarI digest and connects the signal peptide directly to region G. The plasmid encoding AP-GPC(G) was constructed by amplifying the glypican-1 cDNA with 5′-CGGGATCCGGCGCCTACGGTGGCAAT-3′ (the ninth nucleotide of this sequence corresponds to position 1459 of native glypican-1) and 5′-1641CGGGATCCGGTCTTCTGTCCCTC-3′, digesting the PCR product with BamHI, and ligating it to the APtag-4 (18Cheng H.J. Nakamoto M. Bergemann A.D. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 1995; 82: 371-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) vector that had been pre-digested withBamHI in the proper orientation. The plasmid encoding GPC(N2/G)-AP was made by replacing theNotI to KpnI segment from the glypican-1 coding region of APtag-6His/GPC(N1/N2/G)-AP with an adapter sequence generated by annealing 5′-GGCCGCCGCGCTAGTCGCCTGCGCCCGCGGGGACCCCGCCAGCAAGTGGAATGGGATTTCCAAGGGCCGGTAC-3′ and 5′-CGGCCCTTGGAAATCCCATTCCAGCACTTGCTGGCGGGGTCCCCGCGGGGCGCAGGCGACTAGCGCGGC-3′. This adapter sequence replaces a small part of the signal peptide that was excised in the NotI to KpnI digest and connects the signal peptide directly to region N2. Region N2 mutants N2A, N2B, and N2E were prepared for mutagenesis by subcloning the KpnI to NarI fragment of the glypican-1 cDNA into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The segment containing the N2A mutation was generated by replacing the native KpnI to BalI fragment with an adapter sequence consisting of 5′-CTTCCGGAGATCGAGGGGCGCGGGCTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGCCCGCGCCCCTCGATCTCCGGAAGGTAC-3′. This manipulation changes the original amino acid sequence, VMGD, to IEGR. The segment containing the N2B mutation was made by replacing the nativeKpnI to BalI fragment with an adapter sequence consisting of 5′-CGGTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAACCGGTAC-3′. This manipulation replaces the original amino acid sequence, LPEVMGDG, with an Arg residue. The segment containing the N2E mutation was generated first by removing the BalI to KasI fragment, then DNA polymerase I blunting of the overhanging KasI end, followed by blunt-ended ligation. This series of treatments deletes 35 amino acids from region N2. Following mutagenesis, the mutagenized fragments were released from pBluescript with KpnI and NarI then subsequently used to replace the native sequence flanked byKpnI and NarI sites in GPC(N1/N2/G)-AP. The plasmid encoding N2C was constructed with two PCR products amplified from the glypican-1 cDNA, the first with 5′-1300TGGAATGGGATTTCCAA-3′ and 5′-CCGAATTCACGTAAACGGTTGGTCA-3′ (the ninth nucleotide of this sequence corresponds to position 1458 of native glypican-1) and the second with 5′-CCGAATTCTACGGTGGCAATGAT-3′ (the ninth nucleotide of this sequence corresponds to position 1465 of native glypican-1) and 5′-1641CGGGATCCGGTCTTCTGTCCCTC-3′. The first and second PCR products were digested with EcoRI followed byKpnI and BamHI, respectively. These two PCR fragments, when joined, replace the native NarI site in glypican-1 with an EcoRI site. A third fragment containing the remaining N-terminal glypican-1 coding sequence was released withHindIII and KpnI fromAPtag-6His/GPC(N1/N2/G)-AP. These three DNA fragments were simultaneously ligated into APtag-6His vector previously treated with HindIII and BglII. The plasmid encoding N2D was constructed with a PCR product made from the primers 5′-1455ACGTGGCGCCTACGGTGGCATCGAGGGGCGCAATGATGTGGACTTC-3′ and 5′-1641CGGGATCCGGTCTTCTGTCCCTC-3′. This PCR product was intended to replace the native AYGG amino acid sequence with IEGR. However, because of a PCR error the same native sequence was replaced with the tripeptide EGR. This PCR product was digested withNarI and BamHI. Together with a fragment flanked by HindIII and NarI fromAPtag-6His/GPC(N1/N2/G)-AP, the fragments were ligated intoAPtag-6His vector pretreated with HindIII andBglII. The plasmid encoding secreted AP was generated with an adapter sequence made with 5′-GGCCGCCGCGCTAGTCGCCTGCGCCCGCGGGGACCCCGCCAGCAAGAGCGAT-3′ and 5′-ATCGCTCTTGCTGGCGGGGTCCCCGCGGGCGCAGGCGACTAGCGCGGC-3′. The adapter sequence was ligated with APtag-6His/GPC(N1/N2)-AP that had been pretreated with NotI and EcoRV. The resultant coding sequence contains the glypican-1 N-terminal signal peptide followed by AP, with an EcoRV site between the coding regions. The segment encoding a rat betaglycan GAG attachment domain (amino acids 524–545; GenBankTM accession number M77809) was made with two self-annealing primers 5′-ATCATTGTGGTGCAGGCTCCGTCCCCTGGGGATAGCAGTGGCTGG-3′ and 5′-CCGGATCCCTCGAGGTCTTCATAGCCATCAGGCCAGCCACTGCT-3′. Complementary strands were synthesized using DNA polymerase I. The DNA fragment possesses half of the EcoRV site at the 5′ end and aBamHI site at the 3′ end. After synthesis the fragment was digested with BamHI, and the resultant product was ligated into APtag-6His/GPC(N1/N2)-AP and APtag-6His/AP, both of which had been pretreated with EcoRV andBglII, to produce vectors encoding GPC(N1/N2)-B-AP and B-AP, respectively. The segment encoding the human decorin GAG attachment domain (amino acids 23–46; GenBankTM accession number M14219) was created with the primers 5′-ATCGGCTTATTTGACTTTATGCTAGAAGATGAGGCTTCTGGG-3′ and 5′-CCGGATCCGAAGTCGCGGTCATCAGGAACTTCTGGGCCTATCCCAGA-3′. Fragment synthesis, digestion, and insertion into plasmids were performed in a manner similar to the betaglycan fragment, producing vectors encoding GPC(N1/N2)-D-AP and D-AP. 5 × 105 COS cells or CHO cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes in 5 ml of the appropriate growth medium for 24 h. Prior to transfection, cells were washed in 5 ml of HBSS followed by 5 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were then transfected with 5 μg of plasmids encoding AP-tagged protein. In experiments in which multiple plasmids were cotransfected into COS cells, 10 μg of AP or GPC(N1/N2)-AP was used and mixed, where indicated, with 1 μg of GPC(G)-AP. Transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in Opti-MEM medium and an incubation time of 12 h. Next, the transfection medium was replaced with 10 ml of the appropriate growth medium, and this medium was allowed to remain in contact with COS cells for 5 days or CHO cells for 3 days. The conditioned medium was then collected, centrifuged, passed through a 0.45-μm filter, supplemented with 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.05% sodium azide, and stored at 4 °C. AP fusion proteoglycans were purified by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (20Herndon M.E. Lander A.D. Neuron. 1990; 4: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), except that detergents and formate- and urea-containing wash buffers were omitted. The AP concentrations of starting and eluted materials were determined from their enzymatic activities (21Cheng H.J. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 1994; 79: 157-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), and samples were stored at −80 °C with protease inhibitors (2 mm N-methylmaleimide, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol prior to analysis. Heparitinase was prepared fromFlavobacterium heparinum by hydroxyapatite chromatography as described by Linker and Hovingh (22Linker A. Hovingh P. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC (100330, Seikagaku America, Falmouth, MA) treatments (1 unit/ml) were carried out in 50 mm Tris phosphate (pH 7.0) containing protease inhibitors for 2 h with 1 pmol/ml DEAE-purified fusion proteoglycans as substrates. Incubation temperatures were 37 °C for chondroitinase and 43 °C for heparitinase. Heparitinase/chondroitinase combination treatments were carried out at 37 °C. Samples were mixed 4:1 with 5-fold concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected (without heating) to electrophoresis in 6% Laemmli gels for 200 V-h. MgCl2 (1 mm) was added to all buffers to stabilize AP activity. Gels were subsequently washed for 5 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm MgCl2and for 5 min in 100 mm diethanolamine (pH 9.8) containing 1 mm MgCl2. Gel staining was carried out in 20 ml of Sigma FAST BCIP/NBT (Sigma B-5655) which consisted of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.4), 0.15 mg/ml BCIP, 0.3 mg/ml NBT, 5 mm MgCl2 for 30–90 min at 37 °C. After staining, gels were washed with deionized water for 2 h to remove excess substrate and photographed with a digital camera and analyzed using Kodak Digital Science 1D software, version 2.0.2 (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems). The GAG composition of fusion proteins was quantified using a modification of a dot blot assay originally developed for studying molecules with 35SO4-labeled GAG chains. DEAE-purified fusion protein samples treated with no enzyme, heparitinase, chondroitinase, or both heparitinase and chondroitinase were blotted individually onto cationic nylon (Zeta-Probe, Bio-Rad) according to the protocol of Rapraeger and Yeaman (23Rapraeger A. Yeaman C. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) except that the binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 8 murea, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa2SO4) contained 1 mmMgSO4 instead of Na2SO4. Also, to preserve AP activity, samples were not boiled. After binding, the blot was washed twice in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2, and once in 50 ml of 100 mm diethanolamine (pH 9.8), 1 mm MgCl2. For detection of bound fusion proteins, disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan}-4-yl)phenyl (CSPD) AP chemiluminescent substrate solution (Tropix, Foster City, CA) was applied per manufacturer's instructions. The blot was drained, wrapped in plastic, and exposed to HyperFilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The exposed film was then digitally scanned, and the image was analyzed with NIH Image software. Multiple sample dilutions and exposure times were used to verify that all measurements were taken within the linear range of detection. Under these blotting conditions, only molecules containing GAG chains should remain associated with the blotting membrane (23Rapraeger A. Yeaman C. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In practice, some AP activity does associate even when fusion proteins that are unglycanated, or have had their GAG chains digested to completion (as confirmed by SDS-PAGE), are examined. Consequently, in determining the reduction in binding of any fusion protein produced by digestion with either heparitinase or chondroitinase, the signal obtained when both enzymes were used together was subtracted from values obtained when a single enzyme or no enzyme was used. After applying this correction, the fraction of any fusion protein that was taken to be glycanated with HS alone was calculated as the fractional decrease in binding produced by heparitinase. The fraction taken to be glycanated with CS alone was calculated as the fractional decrease in binding produced by chondroitinase. The difference, if any, between the sum of these two fractions and unity, was taken to reflect the fraction of molecules glycanated with both HS and CS, i.e. hybrid PGs. Quantification of glycanation by this method depends upon the assumption that the specific activity of AP fusion proteins is not influenced by the presence of nearby GAG chains. This assumption was validated by control experiments in which the specific activities of AP fusion proteins bearing HS (GPC(N1/N2/G)-AP) and CS (GPC(G)-AP) were tested before and after exposure to GAG lyases and were found not to change (data not shown). Control experiments also supported the assumption that the protein components to which AP is fused also have little if any effect on AP-specific activity. For example, equivalent molar amounts of GPC(N1/N2)-AP and unfused AP (as determined from Coomassie-stained gels) were found to have identical AP activity (data not shown). This observation agrees with experiences of investigators (21Cheng H.J. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 1994; 79: 157-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 24Flanagan J.G. Leder P.

For transfection and selection of cells stably expressing either AP or GPC(N1/N2)-AP, CHO cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells in a 100-mm diameter culture dish in complete Ham's F-12 medium. After 1 day, cells were transfected with 5 μg of APtag-6His/AP or APtag-6His/GPC(N1/N2)-AP with LipofectAMINE in Opti-MEM medium. The medium was changed after 12 h to complete Ham's F-12 medium, and cells were incubated an additional 3 days. Next, the medium was changed to growth medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 and was replaced every 3–4 days for 2 weeks. Cells were then cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates in the continued presence of 200 μg/ml G418. Clones were tested for GPC-AP expression by assaying conditioned media for AP activity. This involved heating 50 μl of conditioned medium to 65 °C for 10 min (to inactivate endogenous phosphatase activity) and mixing with an equal volume of 1 m diethanolamine (pH 9.8), 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 12 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma 104–105) for 10 min, and measuring absorbance at 405 nm (26Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Colonies with the highest AP expression were split into duplicate 35-mm dishes. At confluence, one of the two duplicate dishes of cells was processed for histochemical detection of AP (24Flanagan J.G. Leder P.

The major component of the amyloid deposits is a 39–43-residue peptide, amyloid-β (Aβ).1Aβ fibrillogenesis in vitro is a nucleation-dependent process consisting of a slow lag phase for nucleation followed by faster propagation of fibrils (1Lomakin A. Chung D.S. Benedek G.B. Kirschner D.A. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 2Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury P.T.

However, in vivo fibrillogenesis is likely a complex pathway involving many factors that modulate the aggregation of Aβ. Two mechanisms have been proposed for the nucleation of Aβ fibrils. The first involves the self-assembly of Aβ monomers, which undergo a conformational change to become the fibril nucleus. The second involves an alternative pathway of heterogenous nucleation, which results from outgrowth of fibrils from non-Aβ seeds (1Lomakin A. Chung D.S. Benedek G.B. Kirschner D.A. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Many proteins are associated with amyloid plaques; their presence may result in heterogeneous nucleation of Aβ (4Bohrmann B. Tjernberg L. Kuner P. Poli S. Levet-Trafit B. Näslund J. Richards G.

Although heparan sulfate proteoglycans have been extensively correlated with plaque formation, in Alzheimer's disease at least four types of proteoglycans are associated with amyloid plaques (12Dewitt D.A.

Aβ-proteoglycan interactions are mediated predominantly through Aβ-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding with GAGs acting as a scaffold for the assembly of the fibrils. The scaffold may function by enhancing the structural features that favor a β-sheet conformation thereby increasing the number of nucleation seeds, as demonstrated by a virtually instantaneous structural transition in Aβ upon addition of GAGs (18McLaurin J. Franklin T. Zhang X. Deng J. Fraser P.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In the later stages of the amyloid pathway, GAGs also act by enhancing lateral aggregation of small fibrils to confer insolubility and protection from proteolysis (18McLaurin J. Franklin T. Zhang X. Deng J. Fraser P.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 19McLaurin J. Fraser P.E. Eur. J.

Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2147-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A structure-activity relationship for Aβ-GAG interactions is slowly emerging based on the affinities of various GAGs. In vitro studies have shown that the chondroitin sulfates are more effective at both nucleation and lateral aggregation of Aβ fibrils than the heparin GAGs (18McLaurin J. Franklin T. Zhang X. Deng J. Fraser P.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Chondroitin sulfates are sulfated on a single face of the polymer and may represent an ideal distribution of charge for Aβ interactions. Therefore, these GAGs were used as the prototype to determine Aβ binding and potentially to develop compounds that could compete with all identified proteoglycans associated with plaques. The GAG binding site on the Aβ peptide has been investigated using amino acid substitution of the Aβ1–28 peptide and as a function of aggregation state (22Castillo G.M. Ngo C. Cummings J. Wight T.N. Snow A.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2452-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 23Gupta-Bansal R. Brunden K.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated that although electrostatic interactions through basic amino acids contribute to GAG binding, nonionic interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals packing, play a role in GAG-induced Aβ folding and aggregation (22Castillo G.M. Ngo C. Cummings J. Wight T.N. Snow A.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2452-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GAG-Aβ interactions are more sensitive to the conformation and aggregation state of Aβ rather than the primary sequence (22Castillo G.M. Ngo C. Cummings J. Wight T.N. Snow A.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2452-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 23Gupta-Bansal R. Brunden K.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Together these results suggested that inhibition of Aβ-GAG interactions through targeting of the GAG binding site on Aβ may not provide a viable therapeutic. Alternatively, the Aβ-GAG interaction may be mediated by a unique binding site on the GAG backbone that could serve as a target for inhibition of amyloid formation. This therapeutic strategy is supported by in vitro studies, which demonstrated that polysulfated compounds could inhibit binding of heparan sulfate to Aβ (24Levengle B. Scanameo A. Ding W. Fillit H. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 1389-1392PubMed Google Scholar). Also using an in vivo model of splenic amyloidosis, small sulfonated or sulfated molecules have been shown to be active inhibitors of amyloid deposition (25Kisilevsky R. Lemieux L.J. Fraser P.E. Kong X. Hultin P.G. Szarek W. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Alternatively, small GAG-derived saccharides may have the alternate effect of enhancing Aβ precipitation into nontoxic plaques and thereby decreasing the presence of toxic Aβ species. To develop more specific therapeutics directed toward Aβ fibrillogenesis, we determined the minimum GAG unit necessary for Aβ binding, fibrillogenesis, and lateral aggregation. Here, we examine the interaction of chondroitin sulfate-derived monosaccharides and disaccharides with Aβ40 and Aβ42. Fluorescence spectroscopy and electron microscopy demonstrate a potent effect of both monosaccharides and disaccharides on the formation and structure of Aβ fibrils. In addition, competitive inhibition ELISAs demonstrate that the binding of both monosaccharides and disaccharides to Aβ inhibits interaction with the polymeric chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate GAGs. Aβ40 and Aβ42 were synthesized by solid phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry by the Hospital for Sick Children's Biotechnology Center (Toronto, ON). Peptides were isolated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a C18 μbondapak column, and purity was determined using mass spectrometry and amino acid analyses. Peptides were initially dissolved in 0.5 ml of 100% trifluoroacetic acid (Aldrich), diluted in distilled H2O, and immediately lyophilized (26Jao S. Ma K. Talafous J. Orlando R. Zagorski M.G. Amyloid Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1997; 4: 240-252Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Peptides were then dissolved in 40% trifluoroethanol (Aldrich) in H2O and stored at −20 °C until use. Alternatively, the lyophilized peptides were dissolved in distilled H2O at 2.5 mm concentration and used immediately. Chondroitin-4-sulfate (bovine trachea, 8000 Da), dermatan sulfate (bovine mucosa, 16,000 Da), chondroitin-6-sulfate (shark cartilage), heparin (porcine intestinal mucosa), heparan sulfate (bovine kidney), and keratan sulfate (bovine cornea) were purchased from Sigma. Chondroitin sulfate-derived disaccharides ΔUA-GlcNAc, ΔUA-GalNAc, ΔUA-GalNAc-4S, ΔUA-GalNAc-6S, and ΔUA-GalNAc-4S,6S were purchased from Dextra Laboratories (Reading, United Kingdom), and ΔUA-2S-GalNAc, ΔUA-2S-GalNAc-4S, ΔUA-2S-GalNAc-6S, and ΔUA-2S-GalNAc-4S,6S were purchased from Calbiochem. Monosaccharidesd-GalNAc,d-GlcNAcd-GalNAc-4S,d-GalNAc-6S, andd-GalNAc-4S,6S were purchased from Sigma. All GAGs and saccharides were dissolved in distilled H2O at 10 mg/ml and stored at −20 °C until use. Tyrosine emission spectra from 290 to 340 nm were collected (excitation wavelength 281 nm, 0.5 s/nm, band pass = 4 nm). A cuvette with a 1-cm path length was used. For the centrifugation studies, 1 μm Aβ40 or Aβ42 was incubated in the presence or absence of chondroitin sulfate subunits at a 1:1 ratio for 24 h. Samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 15,600 × g to sediment aggregates and fibrils as described previously (27Huang T.H.J. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Mol.

The relative amount of tyrosine in the supernatant was then determined. The fluorescence of the noncentrifuged sample was used as a measure of the total tyrosine fluorescence. For negative staining, carbon-coated pioloform grids were floated on aqueous solutions of peptides (100 μg/ml). After grids were blotted and air-dried, the samples were stained with 1% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.0. The peptide assemblies were observed in a Hitachi H-7000 operated with an accelerating voltage of 75 kV (28McLaurin J. Franklin T. Chakrabartty A. Fraser P.E. J. Mol.

Samples were incubated at a 1:1 ratio by weight with a final Aβ concentration of 200 μm for 3 days. Samples were vortexed and 40-μl aliquots were added to 960 μl of 10 μm Thioflavin T in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.0. Steady state fluorescence was measured at 20 °C using a Photon Technology International QM-1 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with excitation intensity correction and magnetic stirrer. Thioflavin T emission spectra from 475 to 495 nm were collected (excitation wavelength 437 nm, 0.5 s/nm, band pass = 4 nm). A cuvette with a 1-cm path length was used. Nunc Immunosorp plates were coated with 100 μl of GAGs (5 μg/ml) and incubated overnight, 4 °C. Simultaneously, Aβ40 and Aβ42 were incubated with chondroitin sulfate-derived monosaccharides and disaccharides at a 1:1 or 1:10 ratio by weight. The plates were rinsed twice with water and blocked with 100 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffered saline. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the plates were washed 3 times with 0.05% Tween 20/phosphate-buffered saline and twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Aβ was then added to the plates and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with shaking. Plates were washed as above before the addition of monoclonal antibody against Aβ, 6F/3D (Dako), 6E10, or 4G8 (Senetek, Carpinteria, CA). The reaction with 50 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG 1:2000 was performed at room temperature for 1 h. Color development was achieved with 100 μl of 2,2′azino-di(3-ehtyl-benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) in 0.1m acetate buffer, pH 4.2. The absorbance was monitored at 415 nm on a Bio-Rad Benchmark microtiter plate reader. We have previously shown that the chondroitin sulfate GAGs are the most efficient at inducing a β-structural transition in Aβ and subsequent fibrillogenesis (18McLaurin J. Franklin T. Zhang X. Deng J. Fraser P.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have used the chondroitin sulfate-derived monosaccharides and disaccharides (Fig.1) to elucidate the minimum sugar moiety necessary for Aβ binding and fibrillogenesis. Chondroitin sulfate subunits are derived by enzymatic cleavage of the GAG chain by chondroitinases ABC, AC-I, -B, or -C. The saccharides used in this study represent repeat disaccharides present in chondroitin-4-sulfate, chondroitin-6-sulfate, and dermatan sulfate, which retain the charge distribution present in the intact GAG (Fig. 1). The monosaccharides are generated by removal of uronic acid from and desulfation of the disaccharides. To investigate the effect of chondroitin sulfate-derived saccharides on Aβ nucleation, the intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence of Aβ40 and Aβ42 was used to monitor the amount of soluble peptide after incubation in the presence and absence of the disaccharides. After 24 h of incubation, soluble Aβ was separated from aggregated and fibrillar peptide by centrifugation (23Gupta-Bansal R. Brunden K.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24Levengle B. Scanameo A. Ding W. Fillit H. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 1389-1392PubMed Google Scholar). Different chondroitin sulfate-derived saccharides had variable effects on the amount of pelletable aggregates detected with greater effects seen for Aβ42 (Fig. 2) over Aβ40 (data not shown). At 24 h, the disaccharides ΔUA-GalNAc-4S, ΔUA-GalNAc-6S, and ΔUA-GalNAc-4S,6S significantly increased the amount of aggregated Aβ40/42 with ΔUA-GalNAc-4S,6S being the most effective (Fig.2 C). It is interesting to note that all disaccharides and in particular ΔUA-GalNAc-4S,6S induced the same extent of fluorescence loss as the intact GAG, dermatan sulfate (Fig. 2 D). These results demonstrate that the presence of chondroitin sulfate-derived disaccharides can be correlated with an increased amount of aggregated Aβ. The characteristics of Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibrils in the presence and absence of chondroitin sulfate-derived saccharides were examined by electron microscopy. Previous investigations indicated that GAG promoted morphological changes in the fibrous structures formed by Aβ40 and Aβ42 (18McLaurin J. Franklin T. Zhang X. Deng J. Fraser P.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Unseeded samples of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 were incubated in the presence of chondroitin sulfate-derived disaccharides, intact chondroitin sulfate GAGs, and alone for up to 96 h. Negative stain electron microscopy demonstrated that Aβ42 fibrils were 50–70 Å in diameter with an average length of 750 Å (Fig.3 A). These were indistinguishable from those of Aβ42 in the presence of the desulfated ΔUA-GalNAc (Fig. 3 B) or ΔUA-GlcNAc (data not shown). The monosulfated disaccharides, ΔUA-GalNAc-6S and ΔUA-GalNAc-4S, induced fibrils of similar size but with increased lateral aggregation as compared with control (Fig. 3 C). The bundles of fibers were similar to those seen in the presence of polymeric chondroitin sulfate GAGs (18McLaurin J. Franklin T. Zhang X. Deng J. Fraser P.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In the presence of ΔUA-GalNAc-4S,6S, Aβ42 formed many fibers displaying extensive lateral aggregation as illustrated by the heavily stained clusters of fibrils (Fig. 3 D). These results demonstrate that the sulfated disaccharides derived from chondroitin sulfate are representative of the intact GAG chains in terms of activity. The extent of lateral aggregation induced by the disaccharides reflects that of the intact GAGs, with 4-sulfate < 6-sulfate < 4/6-sulfate. Another major component of polymeric GAGs are the 2-sulfated iduronic acid disaccharides, which are present predominantly in heparan sulfate GAGs. Certain repeating disaccharide motifs containing sulfated iduronic acid are also present as part of the chondroitin and dermatan sulfate backbones. Many studies have demonstrated that charge distribution across small molecules represents the limiting factor for Aβ binding (28McLaurin J. Franklin T. Chakrabartty A. Fraser P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Tomiyama T. Shoji A. Kataoka K. Suwa Y. Asano S. Kaneko H. Endo N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6839-6844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Therefore, the introduction of a sulfate group onto the iduronic acid may present a more favorable or deleterious surface for Aβ binding. To investigate these possibilities, we examined the effect of 2-sulfated iduronic acid-containing disaccharides on fibril assembly and morphology. Negative stain electron microscopy demonstrated that the extra sulfate on the ΔUA-2S-GalNAc had no effect on the Aβ42 fibers formed in comparison to Aβ42 alone or in the presence of ΔUA-GalNAc (data not shown). In the presence of ΔUA-2S-GalNAc-4S and ΔUA-2S-GalNAc-6S, many short fibers could be detected displaying limited aggregation. (Fig.3 E). Incubation of Aβ42 with ΔUA-2S-GalNAc-4S,6S results in the development of thick aggregated fibers displaying a helical twist (Fig. 3 F). Close examination of the fibers reveal a length of 300–500 Å with a diameter of 100 Å, which correspond to mature amyloid fibers. These results demonstrate that the sulfate group on the second position of the iduronic acid does not effect the morphology of Aβ fibrils formed in the presence of sulfated GalNAc disaccharides. Furthermore, these data suggest that using a disaccharide with a sulfated iduronic acid does not contribute to the minimal unit necessary for Aβ binding and enhanced fibrillogenesis. GAGs also laterally aggregate preformed Aβ fibrils into large masses characteristic of insoluble plaques. To evaluate this phenomenon as induced by chondroitin sulfate-derived disaccharides, we incubated the saccharides with preformed Aβ40 fibrils and examined the morphology by negative stain electron microscopy. Preincubated Aβ40 forms long fibers that are nonaggregated (Fig.4 A). In contrast, dermatan sulfate induced a consistent lateral aggregation of Aβ40 fibrils with apparent helical twisting (Fig. 4 B). The fiber bundles had a cumulative diameter of up to 200 Å, but the average length of the fibers remained unaffected. In the presence of chondroitin sulfate-derived disaccharides, Aβ40 lateral aggregation was similar to that of an extended GAG polymer, with the disulfated ΔUA-GalNAC-4S,6S being the most effective (Fig. 4 C). The fibers were aligned in large bundles rather than a haphazard distribution across the grid. These data indicate that the binding of chondroitin sulfate-derived disaccharides to Aβ fibrils is sufficient to stabilize the macromolecular structure of pre-existing fibers by lateral aggregation and represent the smallest unit responsible for interfiber stabilization. Similar to polymeric GAGs, all data taken together demonstrate that the extent of sulfation on the disaccharide backbone defines the extent to which the disaccharide interacts with and stabilizes Aβ. Furthermore, these small GAG-derived saccharides demonstrate the potential use of these molecules to decrease the soluble pool of Aβ in situ by enhancing the precipitation of nontoxic fibers. The effect of chondroitin sulfate-derived monosaccharides on the induction of Aβ42 fibrillogenesis was investigated. To investigate the effect of chondroitin sulfate-derived saccharides on Aβ nucleation, the intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence of Aβ40 and Aβ42 was used to monitor the amount of soluble peptide after incubation in the presence and absence of the monosaccharides. At 24 h, no significant difference could be detected in the amount of Aβ40/42 pelleted in the presence and absence of the monosaccharidesd-GalNAc,d-GalNAc-4S, andd-GalNAc-6S, whereas a slight increase in the amount of Aβ42 pelleted in the presence ofd-GalNAc-4S,6S could be detected (Fig. 2 B). The morphology of Aβ fibrils in the presence of chondroitin sulfate-derived monosaccharides was investigated using negative stain electron microscopy. Similar to Aβ42 alone (Fig.5 A), the presence of nonsulfatedd-GalNAc andd-GlcNAc induced fibers similar to mature amyloid fibers (Fig. 5 B). In the presence ofd-GalNAc-4S ord-GalNAc-6S (Fig.5 C), the fibers were less abundant and of varying lengths but exhibited some aggregation as demonstrated by the uneven, heavily stained distribution of fibers across the grid. Alternatively, in the presence ofd-GalNAc-4S,6S andd-galacturonic acid, Aβ42 formed many protofibrils characterized by short flexible fibrils (Fig. 5 D). This suggests that binding of the sulfated monosaccharide d-GalNAc-4S,6S ord-galacturonic acid to Aβ enhances the nucleation stage of fibrillogenesis resulting in the formation of many protofibrils. The ability ofd-galacturonic acid but notd-GalNAc to nucleate Aβ may not be surprising because of the differences in charge distribution across the sugar backbone.d-Galacturonic acid is derived by removal of theN-acetylamine group from position 4 of the sugar backbone, and the resultant charge distribution may represent a preferential binding motif. These data further suggest that monosaccharides can inhibit the formation of mature amyloid fibers by blocking the self-association of protofibrils. Further evidence to support this hypothesis is derived from the lack of lateral aggregation of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 preformed fibrils by all monosaccharides (data not shown). Thioflavin T specifically stains amyloid deposits in vivoand has been shown to bind both Aβ fibers and aggregates in vitro (30Tjernberg L.O. Callaway D.J.E. Tjernberg A. Hahne S. Lilliehook C. Terenius L. Thyberg J. Nordstedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12619-12625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). We investigated the binding of Thioflavin T to chondroitin sulfate-derived saccharide-Aβ complexes to further characterize the nature of these fibers. Thioflavin T fluorescence intensity increased for both Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the presence of intact chondroitin sulfate GAGs (Fig. 6). In the presence ofd-GalNAc, the Thioflavin T fluorescence was indistinguishable from Aβ42 alone, which is consistent with our electron microscopy data. Thioflavin T fluorescence increased in the presence ofd-GalNAc-6S but to a lesser extent than chondroitin-6-sulfate. When incubated withd-galacturonic acid ord-GalNAc-4S,6S, Aβ42 demonstrated a morphology similar to protofibrils and exhibited a Thioflavin T fluorescence greater than Aβ42 alone. These results demonstrate that the protofibrils induced by chondroitin sulfate-derived monosaccharides have characteristics similar to typical amyloid fibers. In summary, our data demonstrate that chondroitin sulfate-derived monosaccharides bind Aβ and induce fibrillogenesis without lateral aggregation. To compare the specificity of chondroitin sulfate-derived saccharide binding, we used competitive inhibition ELISAs to determine whether the chondroitin sulfate-derived saccharides could compete with intact GAG chains for Aβ40 and Aβ42 binding (TableI). Concentration-dependent studies were used to determine both the specificity of competition and the relative binding strengths of each component. The chondroitin sulfate-derived monosaccharides and disaccharides were preincubated with Aβ40 and Aβ42 before incubation with chondroitin-4-sulfate, chondroitin-6-sulfate, or dermatan sulfate. The amount of Aβ bound to the intact GAG chain on the microtiter plate was determined using the anti-Aβ antibodies 6E10, 4G8, or 6F/3D. All antibodies demonstrated similar concentration-dependent inhibition profiles indicating that the detection antibody was not a determining factor.d-GalNAc and ΔUA-GalNAc were unable to compete with the chondroitin sulfate GAGs for Aβ binding, which is in agreement with our electron microscopy data in which Aβ40/42 fibrils were indistinguishable in the presence and absence ofd-GalNAc and ΔUA-GalNAc. The monosaccharidesd-galacturonic acid,d-GalNAc-6S, andd-GalNAc-4S,6S were all effective at competing with all chondroitin sulfate GAGs for Aβ binding at a 1:10 ratio (by weight). These results suggest that the alterations in fibrous structure detected by electron microscopy and fluorescence studies can be attributed to the binding of these monosaccharides to the GAG binding site on Aβ40 and Aβ42. These observations further suggest that the monosaccharidesd-galacturonic acid,d-GalNAc-6S, andd-GalNAc-4S,6S are sufficient to induce Aβ binding and structural transitions associated with Aβ-GAG interactions. It was not surprising to find thatd-GalNAc-4S competed poorly with all GAGs for Aβ binding because the intact chondroitin-4-sulfate is the least effective of all the chondroitin sulfate GAGs at inducing the structural transitions necessary for fibril formation and aggregation (18McLaurin J.

The switch from short- to long-term facilitation requires activation of CREB1, derepression of ApCREB2, and induction of ApC/EBP. In search for genes that act downstream from CREB1, we have identified a transcription activator, ApAF, which is stimulated by protein kinase A and can dimerize with both ApC/EBP and ApCREB2. ApAF is necessary for long-term facilitation induced by five pulses of serotonin, by activation of CREB1, or by derepression of ApCREB2. Overexpression of ApAF enhances the long-term facilitation further. Thus, ApAF is a candidate memory enhancer gene downstream from both CREB1 and ApCREB2."
https://openalex.org/W2104566554,"Ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K1), through phosphorylation of the 40 S ribosomal protein S6 and regulation of 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract mRNAs, is an important regulator of cellular translational capacity. S6K1 has also been implicated in regulation of cell size. We have recently identified S6K2, a homolog of S6K1, which phosphorylates S6 in vitroand is regulated by the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways in vivo. Here, we characterize S6K2 regulation by PI3-K signaling intermediates and compare its regulation to that of S6K1. We report that S6K2 is activated similarly to S6K1 by the PI3-K effectors phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1, Cdc42, Rac, and protein kinase Cζ but that S6K2 is more sensitive to basal activation by myristoylated protein kinase Cζ than is S6K1. The C-terminal sequence of S6K2 is divergent from that of S6K1. We find that the S6K2 C terminus plays a greater role in S6K2 regulation than does the S6K1 C terminus by functioning as a potent inhibitor of activation by various agonists. Removal of the S6K2 C terminus results in an enzyme that is hypersensitive to agonist-dependent activation. These data suggest that S6K1 and S6K2 are similarly activated by PI3-K effectors but that sequences unique to S6K2 contribute to stronger inhibition of its kinase activity.

Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). S6 phosphorylation up-regulates translation of mRNAs with 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tracts, many of which encode ribosomal proteins and translation elongation factors (2Jefferies H.B. Fumagalli S. Dennis P.B. Reinhard C. Pearson R.B. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). S6K1 activation thus up-regulates ribosome biosynthesis and enhances the translational capacity of the cell.Deletion of S6K1 in Drosophila and mice has implicated S6K1 in regulation of cell size. The Drosophila knockout has a high incidence of embryonic lethality, but surviving flies exhibit a marked reduction in size that is cell autonomous (3Montagne J. Stewart M.J. Stocker H. Hafen E. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 1999; 285: 2126-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Mice lacking S6K1 through targeted disruption also exhibit a small animal phenotype (4Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, S6 phosphorylation and 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract mRNA translation were found to be normal in fibroblasts derived from mice lacking S6K1, suggesting a compensatory mechanism for these S6K1 functions. Our lab and others have recently identified S6K2, a homolog of S6K1 that phosphorylates S6 in vitro (4Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5115-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Elevated S6K2 mRNA levels have been reported in the S6K1 knockout mice (4Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Drosophila are thought to express only S6K1, which may account for the more severe S6K1 knockout phenotype in flies. S6K2 is a good candidate kinase that may supply some but not all of the functions of S6K1 in the knockout mouse, because the small animal phenotype persists despite the presence of S6K2, S6 phosphorylation, and 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract mRNA translation.There are two isoforms of both S6K1 and S6K2 derived from alternative splicing at the N terminus. The p70S6K1αII isoform is cytosolic, whereas p85 S6K1αI is nuclear (8Reinhard C. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4052-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast, both isoforms of S6K2 (p54 S6K2βII, p60 S6K2βI) (5Gout I. Minami T. Hara K. Tsujishita Y. Filonenko V. Waterfield M.D. Yonezawa K. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5108-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) are primarily nuclear, because of the presence of a C-terminal putative nuclear localization signal sequence (NLS) (7Koh H. Jee K. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D. Yun Y.H. Kim J.W. Choi H.S. Chung J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5115-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) not found in S6K1. Point mutation of the putative NLS (K474M) results in cytosolic immunolocalization of S6K2βII (7Koh H. Jee K. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D. Yun Y.H. Kim J.W. Choi H.S. Chung J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5115-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The S6K2 βI and βII isoforms may reside in distinct nuclear compartments based on subcellular fractionation studies (6Lee-Fruman K.K. Kuo C.J. Lippincott J. Terada N. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5108-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).S6K1 and S6K2 are highly homologous overall, with the greatest sequence homology in the kinase domain and adjacent regulatory linker domain. A schematic diagram of S6K1 and S6K2 outlining regions of homology, features unique to S6K2, and regulatory phosphorylation sites is provided in Fig. 1. Seven of eight mitogen-stimulated regulatory phosphorylation sites identified in S6K1 are conserved in human S6K2. There are interesting differences in S6K2 primary structure that may confer differential regulation and functions to this kinase. There are regions of sequence divergence between S6K1 and S6K2 in the N- and C-terminal domains. In addition to the nuclear localization signal, the C terminus of S6K2 also contains a proline-rich domain not found in S6K1.In both S6K1 and S6K2, the conserved core catalytic and linker domains are flanked by regulatory N- and C-terminal domains. For S6K1, it is thought that interaction between N-terminal acidic residues and C-terminal basic residues inhibits the kinase by allowing a C-terminal pseudosubstrate region to occlude the kinase domain. Mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation of the C-terminal Ser/Thr-Pro motifs is believed to disrupt these interactions, relieving autoinhibition of S6K1 and exposing other regulatory sites, including the major rapamycin-sensitive site, T389, and the catalytic activation loop site, Thr229 (9Cheatham L.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).The PI3 kinase (PI3-K) and mTOR signaling pathways mediate multiple mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation events that lead to S6K1 activation. Consistent with the important roles of these pathways in S6K1 regulation, S6K1 activation is inhibited by pharmacological inhibitors of these pathways (11Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 12Chung J. Grammer T. Lemon K. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The immunosuppressant rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, leads to rapid and complete dephosphorylation and inactivation of S6K1 (11Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). The role of mTOR in S6K1 activation may be suppression of an S6K1 phosphatase (13Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). There is also evidence suggesting that mTOR may directly phosphorylate S6K1 (14Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). S6K2 activation is also sensitive to rapamycin, and the analogous rapamycin-sensitive mitogen-stimulated S6K1 phosphorylation sites are conserved in S6K2 (Thr388, Ser410, Ser417, and Ser423) (4Shima H.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5115-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Multiple PI3-K effectors provide distinct inputs to S6K1 activation. Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) is a constitutively active kinase whose access to many substrates is regulated by PI3-K-derived phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (15Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr229 in the S6K1 catalytic domain activation loop by PDK1 is a critical activating input (15Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 16Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). PDK1 may also phosphorylate Thr389 (17Balendran A. Currie R. Armstrong C.G. Avruch J. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37400-37406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The PI3-K- and PDK1-regulated atypical PKC isoforms ζ and λ have also been implicated in S6K1 regulation (18Romanelli A. Martin K.A. Toker A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Akimoto K. Nakaya M. Yamanaka T. Tanaka J. Matsuda S. Weng Q.P. Avruch J. Ohno S. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These atypical PKCs interact with S6K1, but it is not yet known whether they directly phosphorylate S6K1. We have reported growth factor-independent coimmunoprecipitation of PDK1, PKCζ, and S6K1, suggesting the existence of preassembled complexes of PI3-K-regulated signaling molecules (18Romanelli A. Martin K.A. Toker A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our lab has also demonstrated association of the PI3-K-regulated Rho family G proteins Cdc42 and Rac with S6K1 and has shown that these G proteins contribute to S6K1 activation (20Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Cdc42 and PKCζ or PKCλ have recently been shown to associate (21Coghlan M.P. Chou M.M. Carpenter C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Cdc42/Rac activation of S6K1 is not yet known but requires isoprenylation of the G protein, suggesting that membrane targeting is important (20Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).Preliminary studies using pharmacological inhibitors suggest that, like S6K1, S6K2 is regulated by the PI3-K and mTOR signaling pathways (4Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gout I. Minami T. Hara K. Tsujishita Y. Filonenko V. Waterfield M.D. Yonezawa K. J.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5115-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have shown that a constitutively active PI3-K p110 subunit activates S6K2 and that S6K2 is activated by PDK1 (6Lee-Fruman K.K. Kuo C.J. Lippincott J. Terada N. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5108-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Others have found that S6K2, like S6K1, can be regulated by the PI3-K effector Akt/PKB (7Koh H. Jee K. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D. Yun Y.H. Kim J.W. Choi H.S. Chung J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5115-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, further characterization of the signaling intermediates that regulate S6K2 has not yet been addressed. Given the differences in subcellular localization and primary sequence and the lack of complete functional redundancy between these homologs in the S6K1 knockout mice (4Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we aimed to examine in detail the regulation of S6K2. Here, we report that although S6K2 is regulated similarly to S6K1 by PI3-K effectors, the C terminus of S6K2 exerts a more potent inhibitory effect on the kinase.RESULTSS6K2, like S6K1, is regulated by the PI3-K pathway. S6K2 is activated by constitutively active p110 PI3-K and inhibited when cells are treated with wortmannin (6Lee-Fruman K.K. Kuo C.J. Lippincott J. Terada N. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5108-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Wortmannin-sensitive phosphorylation sites found in S6K1 are conserved in S6K2 and S6K1. Multiple PI3-K pathway effectors have been implicated in S6K1 activation. Given the differences in primary structure and subcellular localization between S6K2 and S6K1, we sought to determine whether S6K2 is regulated by the same downstream PI3-K effectors known to regulate S6K1 and to investigate the roles of divergent S6K2 C-terminal sequences.Rho Family G Proteins Regulate S6K2Evidence suggests that PI3-K regulates the Rho family G proteins Cdc42 and Rac through activation of their guanine nucleotide exchange factors, such as Dbl and Vav (23Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr Opin Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Cdc42 and Rac regulate S6K1; cotransfection of GTPase-deficient constitutively active point mutants of Cdc42 and Rac (G12V) activates HA-S6K1, and dominant negative point mutants (T17N) with high GDP affinity (which sequester guanine nucleotide exchange factors) antagonize growth factor activation of S6K1 (20Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Similarly, transient cotransfection of HEK293 cells with HA-S6K2 and GST-Cdc42V12 or GST-RacV12 enhanced basal (2–5-fold) and insulin-stimulated (2–3-fold) activity as measured in immune complex kinase assays (Fig.2 A). Consistent with a role for Rho family G proteins in regulation of S6K2, cotransfection of HA-S6K2 with the dominant negative GST-Cdc42N17 mutant inhibits insulin stimulation of HA-S6K2, as well as HA-S6K1, activity (Fig.2 B). PDK1 activates S6K1 by phosphorylating Thr229 in the catalytic activation loop (15Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr.

It is likely that Cdc42 contributes an S6K-activating function distinct from that of PDK1, because cotransfection of submaximally activating levels of Myc-PDK1 and GST-Cdc42V12 cooperatively activate S6K2. We demonstrate here for the first time that this is also the case with S6K1 (Fig. 3).Figure 2Rho family G proteins regulate S6K2. A, constitutively active mutants of Cdc42 or Rac activate HA-S6K2. HEK293 cells were transfected with 1.0 μg of HA-S6K2/pcDNA3 and the indicated amounts of GST-Cdc42V12/pEBG, GST-RacV12/pEBG, or pEBG vector as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transfected cells were quiesced in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to 30 min of stimulation with 100 nminsulin. Cells were lysed as described, and protein expression levels were assayed by immunoblotting with anti-HA or -GST antibodies. HA-S6K2 expression levels were normalized by quantitative immunoblotting using a Bio-Rad FluorS MultiImager prior to immune complex kinase assay. Kinase activity in anti-HA immunoprecipitates was quantitated with a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). These results are representative of at least two experiments. B, a dominant negative Cdc42 mutant inhibits HA-S6K2 activity. HEK293 cells were transfected with 1.0 μg of HA-S6K2/pcDNA3 or 0.5 μg of HA-S6K1/pRK7 and the indicated amounts of GST-Cdc42N17/pEBG or pEBG vector and starved, insulin-stimulated, and lysed as above.

Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This suggests that membrane targeting of Cdc42 may be required. An attractive hypothesis is that association with Cdc42 may transiently target S6K1 to a cellular membrane in the course of its activation. This membrane targeting may be important for access to other membrane-associated S6K1 activators such as PDK1 and PKCζ. Because S6K2 is thought to be primarily nuclear, it is notable that the cytosolic proteins Cdc42 and Rac can regulate this kinase. We determined that isoprenylation of GST-Cdc42V12 is required for this effect, because GST-Cdc42V12,C189S fails to activate HA-S6K2 when cotransfected (Fig. 4). These data suggest that despite localization primarily to the nucleus, S6K2 is regulated by cytosolic, isoprenylated low molecular weight G proteins. We hypothesize therefore that S6K2 may shuttle in and out of the nucleus and target to a membrane during the course of its activation.Figure 4A prenylation-deficient mutant Cdc42V12 fails to activate HA-S6K2. HEK293 cells were transfected with 1.0 μg of HA-S6K2/pcDNA3 with 2 μg of GST-Cdc42V12/pEBG, GST-Cdc42V12/C189S/pEBG, or pEBG vector. Cells were starved, insulin-stimulated, and lysed as in Fig. 2.

Martin K.A. Toker A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKCζ is activated by binding PI3-K-derived phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and by interaction with and phosphorylation by PDK1 (22Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.-S.

Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Although PKCζ is not sufficient to activate S6K1 under basal conditions, when coexpressed with PDK1, a strong S6K1 activation is observed (18Romanelli A. Martin K.A. Toker A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation of S6K1, PDK1, and PKCζ suggests their participation in a PI3-K-regulated signaling complex (18Romanelli A. Martin K.A. Toker A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address whether PKCζ can regulate S6K2 in vivo, we cotransfected a constitutively active FLAG-tagged, myristoylated PKCζ (myr-PKCζ) construct with HA-S6K2, which resulted in basal and insulin-stimulated HA-S6K2 activation (Fig. 5 A). There was a notable difference between S6K1 and S6K2, because HA-S6K1 was activated only modestly (up to 2-fold) by cotransfection of myr-PKCζ in quiescent cells (Fig. 5 A) and (18Romanelli A. Martin K.A. Toker A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas HA-S6K2 was activated 5–30-fold under basal conditions (Fig.5 A), suggesting that S6K2 may be more sensitive to regulation by atypical PKCs. Further supporting a role for PKCζ in activation of HA-S6K2 was the observation that insulin-stimulated activity was inhibited by cotransfection of the dominant negative FLAG-PKCζK281W (PKCζK/W) (Fig. 5 B), as is the case with S6K1 (18Romanelli A. Martin K.A. Toker A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, HA-S6K2 is cooperatively activated by combined cotransfection of submaximally activating levels of myr-PKCζ and PDK1 (Fig. 6). Under these conditions, the constitutively active myr-PKCζ is not further activated by PDK1 (22Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.-S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the modest overexpression of both activators results in synergistic activation of S6K2. Although both S6K1 and S6K2 are inhibited by dominant negative PKCζ(K/W) and cooperatively activated by PDK1 and myr-PKCζ, only S6K2 basal activity is substantially activated by myr-PKCζ alone. These data provide the first evidence that S6K1 and S6K2 can be differentially regulated.Figure 5Atypical PKC ζ regulates HA-S6K2. A, myristoylated PKCζ activates HA-S6K2.

Because the C-terminal domain is a region of divergence between S6K1 and S6K2, we sought to determine the effect of deletion of this domain on regulation of S6K2. Amino acids 399–482 encoding the pseudosubstrate and proline-rich regions, as well as the NLS, were deleted from HA-S6K2 (Fig. 1), and the activity of the resulting mutant (HA-S6K2-ΔCT) was assayed in transfected HEK293 cells. Surprisingly, deletion of the C terminus resulted in enhanced basal and insulin-stimulated activity (Figs. 7 and 8). By contrast, the analogous truncation mutant of S6K1 is mitogen-regulated but is less active than the full-length kinase and is not more sensitive to insulin (9Cheatham L. Monfar M. Chou M.M.

The S6K2 C-terminal truncation did not significantly alter sensitivity of the kinase to wortmannin (Fig. 7 B), suggesting that essential inputs from the PI3-K pathway are primarily integrated in regions upstream of amino acid 399.Figure 7C-terminal truncation potentiates HA-S6K2 activation.

No other regions of sequence similarity aside from the J-domain exist between DjlA and the known DnaK (Hsp70) co-chaperones DnaJ (Hsp40) and CbpA. In this study, we explored whether and to what extent DjlA possesses DnaK co-chaperone activity and under what conditions a DjlA-DnaK interaction could be important to the cell. We found that the DjlA J-domain can substitute fully for the J-domain of DnaJ using various in vivo functional complementation assays. In addition, the purified cytoplasmic fragment of DjlA was shown to be capable of stimulating DnaK ATPase in a manner indistinguishable from DnaJ, and, furthermore, DjlA could act as a DnaK co-chaperone in the reactivation of chemically denatured luciferase in vitro. DjlA expression in the cell is tightly controlled, and even its mild overexpression leads to induction of mucoid capsule. Previous analysis showed that DjlA-mediated induction of the wca capsule operon required the RcsC/RcsB two-component signaling system and that wcainduction by DjlA was lost when cells contained mutations in either thednaK or grpE gene. We now show using allele-specific genetic suppression analysis that DjlA must interact with DnaK for DjlA-mediated stimulation of capsule synthesis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that DjlA is a co-chaperone for DnaK and that this chaperone—co-chaperone pair is implicated directly, or indirectly, in the regulation of colanic acid capsule.

In E. coli, DnaJ has long been recognized as a partner protein and key regulator of DnaK ATPase activity, together with the nucleotide exchange factor, GrpE (1Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The general mechanism of the Hsp70 chaperones, including DnaK, is that binding and release of protein substrates is tightly coupled to their ATPase cycle (2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3120) Google Scholar, 3Bukau B. Howich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). The Hsp40 family of molecular chaperones is defined by a short, ∼70-amino acid residue signature sequence, termed the J-domain, which helps direct interaction with partner Hsp70 chaperones (4Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 5Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem.

Indeed, the J-domain of DnaJ is absolutely essential for its interaction with DnaK and is specifically required for stimulation of the ATPase activity (1Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C.

A highly conserved HPD tripeptide, located in an exposed loop of the J-domain, is critical for co-chaperone function because mutations in these residues severely compromise the stimulation of ATP hydrolysis, not only in E. coli, but in many other organisms (5Kelley W.L.

The E. coli genome codes for two Hsp40 proteins, DnaJ and CbpA, and two putative J-domain proteins, DjlA and Hsc20. DnaJ and its close orthologs are characterized by four domains: an N-terminal J-domain, a region rich in glycine and phenylalanine, a zinc finger domain, and a C-terminal domain thought to be involved in substrate binding (4Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 5Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). CbpA is 39% identical to DnaJ at its entire length and 55% at its J-domain (12Ueguchi C. Kakeda M. Yamada H. Mizuno T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CbpA is a multicopy suppressor ofdnaJ mutations and is thus a functional ortholog of DnaJ (13Yamashino T. Kakeda M. Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A cbpA null mutation shows a synthetic phenotype with a dnaJ null mutation, the doubly mutant strain becoming hypersensitive for growth above 37 °C and below 16 °C (14Ueguchi C. Shiozawa T. Kakeda M. Yamada H. Mizuno T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3894-3896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hsc20 possesses only 20% sequence similarity to the DnaJ J-domain and is unable to interact productively with DnaK (15Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 16Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By sequence alignment methods, DjlA possesses a J-domain signature sequence at its extreme C terminus with 31% sequence identity (17Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 913-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) but otherwise possesses no sequence similarity to other regions of DnaJ and CbpA. Many Hsp70 co-chaperones have only the J-domain signature in their sequence (5Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Thus, DjlA could represent a third DnaK co-chaperone inE. coli, but under what circumstances is unclear. A clue to a potential role for DjlA in the cell emerged in previous studies when we and others (17Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 913-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 18Zuber M. Hoover T.A. Court D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4238-4244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Clarke D.J. Jacq A.

Microbiol. 1997; 25: 933-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) showed that DjlA overexpression could trigger the synthesis of a colanic acid polysaccharide capsule. In E. coli, a colanic acid capsule can be induced by environmental stress such as osmotic shock, low temperature, and desiccation (21Ophir T. Gutnick D.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 740-745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sledjeski D.D. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1204-1206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Because a colanic acid capsule is not normally observed at 37 °C, or under physiological conditions prevailing within the host intestinal tract, it has been suggested that this adaptive response may help cells to survive conditions outside the host (24Gottesman S. Stout V. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1599-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no link has been shown between colanic acid capsule production and pathogenicity (25Allen P.M. Fisher D. Saunders J.R. Hart C.A. J. Med. Microbiol. 1987; 24: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Russo T.A. Sharma G. Weiss J. Brown C. Microb. Pathog. 1995; 18: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), although a recent study suggests a role for colanic acid in the architecture of biofilms (27Danese P.N. Pratt L.A. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3593-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The major structural genes for colanic acid synthesis in E. coli K-12 are found in the wcaABCDE locus, formerly called cps (28Reeves P.R. Nobbs M. Valvano M.A. Skurnik M. Whitfield C. Coplin D.

Detailed analysis of colanic acid induction has demonstrated that the wza-wcaoperon (hereby referred to as wca) is regulated by the RcsC/RcsB two-component histidine kinase signaling system (24Gottesman S. Stout V. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1599-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 31Stout V. Res. Microbiol. 1994; 145: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Parkinson J.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 857-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Induction of wca by DjlA is dependent on both RcsC and RcsB, suggesting that DjlA modulated the activity of this phosphorelay sensor. Previous genetic analyses of parameters affecting capsule induction revealed that activation of a wcaB-lacZ reporter by DjlA was abrogated in strains containing mutations in genes encoding the molecular chaperones DnaK and GrpE but was not adversely affected by null mutations in genes encoding DnaJ, CbpA, HtpG (Hsp90), or Hsc66 (Hsp70 homolog) (17Kelley W.L.

In the present work, we have used both biochemical and genetic analyses to address whether DjlA is abona fide DnaK co-chaperone and whether direct DjlA-DnaK interaction is necessary for wca activation.

The wild typednaK + version of pWCS19, pKG9, was prepared by the QuickchangeTM method (Stratagene) using the primers 5′-CTGGAAGTAAAACGTATCATCAACGAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTCGTTGATGATACGTTTTACTTCCAG-3′. The dnaK +wild type sequence was verified and tested for functional complementation of the dnaK103 mutant strain CG800, which is otherwise unable to form colonies at 42 °C and cannot support growth of bacteriophage λ at any temperature. The wild type and mutantdnaK genes were re-engineered for DnaK expression using a p15A-derived replicon that is compatible in cells harboring the ColE1-derived pBAD vectors (38Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3951) Google Scholar). Briefly, pACYC184 (39Chang A.C.Y. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with HincII, and the 3,178-base pair fragment was purified and self-ligated in the presence of NsiI linkers (5′-CATGCATG-3′). The resulting plasmid, pWKG59, was then digested withHindIII and NsiI, and the 2,556-base pairori p15A-cam r fragment, containing the ori of replication, was ligated with the 3,509-base pairHindIII-NsiI fragment containinglacI q, pTrc promoter, and downstreamdnaK sequence from pWCS19, or pKG9, to yield plasmid pKG7 (dnaKR167H) or pKG8 (dnaK +), respectively.

The resulting plasmid, pWKG55, was sequence verified. Plasmids pWKG90 and pWKG100 (33Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plasmids pWKG90 and pWKG100 were digested withEcoRI-KpnI to remove the E. coliJ-domain and then exchanged with a 220-base pair polymerase chain reaction fragment derived from the plasmid templates pWKG50 (djlA), pWKG54 (djlAH233Q), or pWKG55 (djlAD235N) (17Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 913-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) that had been digested with the same enzymes. Primer sets 5′-GGGAATTCACCATGGAAGATGCCTGTAATG-3′, and 5′-CCGGTACCTTTAAACCCTTTCTGCTGCTT-3′ were used to amplify the djlA J-domains and introduced the appropriateEcoRI and KpnI restriction sites. All constructs were sequence verified using appropriate primers. Plasmids pKG1, pKG2, and pKG3 contain djlA, djlA(H233Q), anddjlA(D235N) J-domains, respectively, in the pWKG90 vector background. Plasmids pWKG4, pWKG5, and pWKG6 contain the same respective djlA J-domains in the pWKG100 vector background. Bacteriophage laboratory stocks λb2cI−, a clear plaque former, and λdnaJ+ transducing phage were prepared from liquid lysates following infection of the host strain MC4100 using Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with 50 mmMgSO4. 5-ml lysates were treated with chloroform to ensure cell lysis and debris removed by low speed centrifugation. Bacteriophage were serially diluted in SM buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl). Plaque forming assays and spot test viability assays were performed essentially as described previously (33Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). E. coli DnaJ protein was prepared from lysates of strain WGK190 containing pWKG90, al-arabinose inducible promoter vector driving expression of wild type DnaJ (33Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Proc.

E. coliGrpE was prepared from strain DA262 containing plasmid pOD1, al-arabinose inducible promoter vector driving expression of wild type GrpE, and using methods essentially as described (42Deloche O.

J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli DjlA soluble cytoplasmic fragment was purified from strain WKG190 harboring the vector pWKG52 (17Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 913-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), in which the DNA segment encoding the N-terminal 31-amino acid transmembrane-spanning region had been removed. The use of a host strain devoid of both DnaJ and CbpA assured that no other J-domain-containing protein will contaminate the DjlA preparation. Full-length DjlA encoded by the chromosomal copy of djlA is expressed poorly in this genetic background, in addition to being membrane-associated, and thus not detectable by immunoblot analysis in the soluble fraction (17Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 913-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For purification of DjlA cytoplasmic fragment, a fresh overnight culture of pWKG52 in WKG190 was diluted 1:100 into 12 liters of LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 30 °C with vigorous shaking. At anA 600 = 1.0, l-arabinose inducer was added to a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v) and shaking continued for an additional 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested at 10,000 rpm for 10 min in a Sorvall GSA rotor and resuspended in a minimal volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10% (w/v) sucrose. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were lysed with 250 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mmDTT,1 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme) for 60 min on ice. To aid lysis and to reduce viscosity, the cell suspension was briefly heat shocked in a 45 °C immersion bath for 3 min then sonicated with 20 2-s pulses. The lysate was then centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 1 h 45 min in a Beckman 35 Ti rotor. Ammonium sulfate (0.226 g/ml) was added slowly with stirring to the cleared supernatant, and the precipitate was collected after centrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 1 h in a 35 Ti rotor. The pellet was resuspended and dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 30 min in a 35 Ti rotor. The supernatant was then applied to a fast flow Q Sepharose column (2.5 × 20 cm) that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer B. The void volume was collected, and DjlA fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer C (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol). The dialysate was applied to a P-11 phosphocellulose column (2.5 × 20 cm) that had been pre-equilibrated in buffer C. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of buffer C, then developed with a 0.15–0.6m KCl linear gradient in buffer C (800 ml). The 27-kDa DjlA cytoplasmic fragment eluted first, whereas the truncated 25-kDa fragment was well separated, eluting at higher KCl. The two peak fractions were pooled separately, dialyzed against buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol), and concentrated separately by application on an HTP hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) column (1.5 × 15 cm) pre-equilibrated in buffer D. Bound proteins were eluted with a 0–300 mm linear potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, gradient. Peak fractions were pooled, dialyzed against storage buffer E (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol), then quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. For N-terminal protein sequencing, sample aliquots were resolved in 12% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and bands were visualized by staining with 0.1% Amido Black in 25% (v/v) 2-propanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid. Bands were excised, rinsed in sterile water, dried, and applied directly to an Applied Biosystems model 473 Sequencer equipped with a blot cartridge. Protein concentrations were determined using published or derived molar extinction coefficients (45Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 46Gill S.G. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar) or by Bio-Rad dye reagent assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The assay was performed essentially as described previously (1Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The standard reaction conditions were 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 300 μm disodium ATP, 1 μm DnaK, 1 μm GrpE, and DnaJ or DjlA titrated over the range 0–1 μm. [γ-32P]ATP, specific activity of 3,000 Ci/mmol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as tracer in the reaction mixture. Aliquots were removed from the reaction at the specified times, spotted on polyethyleneimine thin layer chromatography plates (Merck), and resolved with a 1:1 solvent mixture 1 m formic acid, 1 m LiCl. Plates were dried and autoradiographed, and the region corresponding to spots was excised and counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Pilot assays were used to determine ATP concentrations necessary for the concentration of DnaK used in the standard assay. For determination of kinetics, linear regression analysis was applied and data points accepted only when correlation coefficients exceeded 0.98. In the analysis presented, all data were obtained in the linear range of the assay, and each data point represents the average rate derived from regression lines compiled from five independent experiments. Data points shown at the zero time point should be considered as subject to a relatively large experimental error because of the sample preparation time. Reactivation of denatured firefly luciferase was performed essentially as described (47Szabo A. Langer T. Schröder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, luciferase (Promega) at a concentration of 2.5 μm was denatured for 90 min at 22 °C in a solution containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 6 mguanidinium hydrochloride, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm KCl, and 15 mm MgCl2. The denatured luciferase was diluted to a final concentration of 80 nm into a reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 50 mmKCl, 5 mm DTT, 15 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 0.015% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm ATP, 1 μm GrpE, and 1 μm DnaK. All components were assembled on ice. Renaturation was initiated by adding either DnaJ or DjlAΔTM (0.4 μm each). The resulting luciferase activity was measured at different time points after incubation at 22 °C by withdrawing aliquots and using the Promega luciferase assay kit (E1500) followed by liquid scintillation counting. The kinetics of luciferase aggregation were followed by measuring light scattering at 320 nm with a Uvikon 940 spectrophotometer using a thermostated cell holder essentially as described (48Goffin L. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Anti-DjlA antibodies, the kind gift of Dr. David Clarke and Dr. I. B. Holland (Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie, Université de Paris Sud), were used at a dilution of 1:20,000. Goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:10,000. Blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescent reagents according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Inspection of DjlA J-domain sequence alignment of residues 208–271 (the native C terminus) revealed 31% identity and 44% similarity to the DnaJ J-domain, including the highly conserved HPD tripeptide (17, Fig. 1). To determine whether the J-domain of DjlA was capable of functional interaction with DnaK, we first constructed plasmids coding for chimeric DnaJ proteins. Conditional expression of the DnaJ chimeras in a dnaJ cbpAdouble null strain permits measurement of J-domain activity (33Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The djlA region encoding the putative DjlA J-domain corresponding to amino acids 206–271 (the native C terminus) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and chimeras were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The plasmids were transformed into strain WKG190 at the permissive temperature of 30 °C, then tested in a colony forming assay. The results are shown in Fig. 2. We observed that the chimeric plasmid pKG1 complemented for bacterial growth at 14 °C or 40 °C as efficiently as wild type DnaJ in the presence, but not in the absence, of the l-arabinose inducer. In contrast, the vector alone did not complement for bacterial growth nor did either of the chimeric plasmids encoding for mutant DjlA J-domains, pKG2 and pKG3. Similar results were observed using plasmids pKG4, pKG5, and pKG6, which encode the truncated DnaJ12 derivatives (data not shown). The failure of the DjlA H233Q and D235N mutant J-domain chimeras to complement was not caused by altered steady-state protein expression levels or stability, as judged by immunoblot analysis or inspection of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels. We observed that the levels of the DjlA J-domain replacement chimeras were about 10-fold lower than DnaJ but were of comparable level when compared with each other (compare the second and fourth lanes from theleft, Fig. 3). We conclude that the mutations in DjlA altering the highly conserved HPD tripeptide were disrupting the otherwise productive J-domain interaction with DnaK. As a second, independent assay of J-domain function, we exploited the dependence of bacteriophage λ upon the host bacterial chaperones DnaK, GrpE, and DnaJ for plaque formation. TableI shows the results of a bacteriophage λ plaque forming assay performed on strain WKG190, harboring the indicated dnaJ or dnaJ12 expression plasmids. The λdnaJ + transducing bacteriophage served as a control because it was expected to form plaques with or withoutl-arabinose, whereas λb2cI−was expected to grow only on plates where both thel-arabinose inducer and a complementing plasmid encodingdnaJ or dnaJ12 were present. We observed that pKG1 and pKG4 could complement as efficiently as pWKG90 or pWKG100 as a source of DnaJ for bacteriophage λ plaque formation. Plasmids pKG2 and pKG5 could not complement for bacteriophage λ plaque formation in this assay, consistent with the observation that the well characterized analogous dnaJ259 mutation (encoding for the corresponding H33Q change) cannot support bacteriophage λ growth either when in single chromosomal copy or when expressed from anl-arabinose-inducible vector (7Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In contrast, pKG3 but not pKG6 allowed the formation of small turbid plaques in the presence of the l-arabinose inducer, indicating partial complementation for bacteriophage λ growth. It should be noted that the λb2cI− bacteriophage employed in this study forms very clear plaques on the wild type host, thus the appearance of very small turbid plaques is most likely caused by extremely low bacteriophage progeny yields. Control experiments using a pBAD expression plasmid carrying dnaJ encoding the equivalent mutation (D35N) did not support the growth of λb2cI− bacteriophage under any conditions tested (data not shown). Taken collectively, these results show that DjlA harbors a bona fide J-domain that is capable of replacing the J-domain of DnaJ in two independent in viv"

The cross-linked or unplatinated 20-base pair duplexes were investigated with the aid of differential scanning calorimetry, temperature-dependent UV absorption, and circular dichroism. The cross-link of both platinum isomers increases the thermal stability of the modified duplexes by changing the molecularity of denaturation. The structural perturbation resulting from the interstrand cross-link of cisplatin increases entropy of the duplex and in this way entropically stabilizes the duplex. This entropic cross-link-induced stabilization of the duplex is partially but not completely compensated by the enthalpic destabilization of the duplex. The net result of these enthalpic and entropic effects is that the structural perturbation resulting from the formation of the interstrand cross-link by cisplatin induces a decrease in duplex thermodynamic stability, with this destabilization being enthalpic in origin. By contrast, the interstrand cross-link of transplatin is enthalpically almost neutral with the cross-link-induced destabilization entirely entropic in origin. These differences are consistent with distinct conformational distortions induced by the interstrand cross-links of the two isomers. Importantly, for the duplex cross-linked by cisplatin relative to that cross-linked by transplatin, the compensating enthalpic and entropic effects almost completely offset the difference in cross-link-induced energetic destabilization. It has been proposed that the results of the present work further support the view that the impact of the interstrand cross-links of cisplatin and transplatin on DNA is different for each and might also be associated with the distinctly different antitumor effects of these platinum compounds.

In addition, agents of biological significance that modify DNA may also affect its thermal and thermodynamic stability, which may be associated with the mechanism underlying biological activity of such agents. Thus, the studies of thermal and thermodynamic stability of DNA modified by various agents are of great interest. It is well established that platinum coordination complexes exhibit antitumor effects (1Rosenberg B. Lippert B. Cisplatin. Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug.

Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug. Wiley-VCH, Zürich1999: 479-496Google Scholar). The success of platinum complexes in killing tumor cells results from their ability to form on DNA various types of covalent adducts that are capable of terminating DNA synthesis (5Comess K.M. Burstyn J.N. Essigmann J.M. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3975-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 6Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2467-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar) and the cellular processes triggered by the presence of those adducts on DNA (7Eastman A. Lippert B. Cisplatin. Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug. Wiley-VCH, Zürich1999: 111-134Google Scholar). The first platinum complex introduced in the clinic iscis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin)1 (1Rosenberg B. Lippert B. Cisplatin. Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug. Wiley-VCH, Zürich1999: 3-30Google Scholar). Although the antitumor effects of cisplatin were discovered more than 30 years ago, the mechanism of its antitumor activity has not yet been fully understood. It has been shown (8Eastman A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1987; 34: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 9Fichtinger-Schepman A.M.J. Van der Veer J.L. Den, H.artog J.H.J. Lohman P.H.M. Reedijk J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar) that this bifunctional platinum complex mainly forms intrastrand cross-links on DNA between neighboring purine residues (∼90%). Other minor adducts are intrastrand cross-links between two purine nucleotides separated by one or more nucleotides; few adducts remain monofunctional. Importantly, cisplatin also forms interstrand cross-links (∼6% in cell-free media in linearized plasmid DNA (10Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 11Vrana O. Boudny V. Brabec V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3918-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)). Transplatin (the transisomer of cisplatin) is clinically ineffective, so that both isomers have been used frequently in studies of the structure-pharmacological activity relationship of platinum complexes. Transplatin-DNA adducts are also intrastrand cross-links but between nonadjacent nucleotides (12Eastman A. Jennerwein M.M. Nagel D.L. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1988; 67: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Transplatin also forms in DNA interstrand cross-links (∼12%) (10Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and a relatively large portion of the adducts remains monofunctional even after long periods of DNA modification (13Eastman A. Barry M.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3303-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It has been postulated (6Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Chem.

Nature. 1999; 399: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) that the antitumor properties of cisplatin are mediated by damaged DNA-binding proteins (for instance those containing a HMG (high mobility group) domain). It has been also shown (15Pilch D.S. Dunham S.U. Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Breslauer K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that the recognition of adducts formed on DNA by platinum complexes is dependent on the extent of thermal or thermodynamic destabilization imposed on the duplex by the adduct. The increase of the thermodynamic destabilization results in the reduced recognition and binding of HMG domain proteins to platinated DNA. In addition, the thermal stability of DNA modified by various platinum compounds, which differ in their antitumor effects, has been also studied. These studies have revealed (16Zaludova R.

Despite great effort devoted to the understanding of how cisplatin modifies DNA and how these modifications are associated with the antitumor effects of cisplatin, the relative efficacy of its intrastrand and interstrand cross-links is unknown. Whereas the thermal and thermodynamic properties of DNA duplexes containing intrastrand cross-link of cisplatin or its analogues have already been studied in detail (15Pilch D.S. Dunham S.U.

It is so despite the fact that DNA interstrand cross-links of platinum complexes could play a very significant role in the biological activity of these compounds because these covalent cross-links preventing separation of the two strands of DNA could block DNA replication markedly more efficiently than intrastrand adducts (23Brabec V. Kelland L.R. Farrell N.P. Platinum Based Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 37-61Google Scholar). In addition, it has been also suggested that nucleotide excision repair may reduce antitumor effects of platinum complexes. Thus, the fact that nucleotide excision repair of interstrand cross-links in general is much more difficult than that of intrastrand cross-links (24Zamble D.B. Mu D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A.

Here we examine the effect of the single, site-specific interstrand cross-link formed by cisplatin or transplatin on the thermal stability and energetics of a 20-base pair (bp) DNA duplex. The differential scanning calorimetric (DSC), temperature-dependent UV absorption, and circular dichroism (CD) properties of the platinated or unplatinated 20-bp duplex were investigated. Cisplatin and transplatin were from Sigma. The synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides d(TGCT) and d(AGCA) (Fig. 1) were purchased from IDT, Inc. (Coralville, IA) and purified as described previously (10Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 27Brabec V. Reedijk J.

Molar extinction coefficients for the single-stranded oligonucleotides were determined by phosphate analysis (21Poklar N. Pilch D.S. Lippard S.J. Redding E.A. Dunham S.U. Breslauer K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7606-7611Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The following extinction coefficients at 260 nm and 25 °C were obtained: 148,000 for unmodified d(TGCT) and 189,000 for unmodified d(AGCA). Isothermal mixing experiments (21Poklar N. Pilch D.S. Lippard S.J. Redding E.A. Dunham S.U. Breslauer K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dimethyl sulfate was from Sigma. The single-stranded oligonucleotide d(TGCT) (the top strand in Fig. 1) at a concentration of 125 μm was reacted with a monoaquamonochloro derivative of cisplatin or transplatin generated by allowing these complexes to react with 0.9 molar equivalent of AgNO3 at an input platinum to strand molar ratio of 3:1 or 3.9: 1, respectively, in 10 mm NaClO4(pH 5.2) at 37 °C. The mixture with cisplatin was incubated for 13 min and the mixture with transplatin for 15 min. Then, the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 0.1 m, and the platinated oligonucleotides were again purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). Using platinum flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS) and measurements of the optical density, it was verified that the modified oligonucleotide contained one platinum atom. It was also verified using dimethyl sulfate footprinting of platinum on DNA (10Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) that in the platinated top strands the N7 position of the central G was not accessible for reaction with dimethyl sulfate, which implies that this G residue was platinated. The platinated strands were allowed to anneal with unplatinated complementary strand d(AGCA) in 0.4 m NaCl (pH 7.4) at 25 °C for 24 h, precipitated by ethanol, dissolved in 0.1 mNaClO4 and incubated for 48 h in the dark at 37 °C. The resulting products were still purified by FPLC in an alkaline gradient. Using this denaturing gradient, non-interstrand cross-linked strands were eluted as 20-nucleotide single strands, whereas the interstrand cross-linked strands were eluted later in a single peak as a higher molecular mass species. This single peak was only collected so that the samples of the interstrand cross-linked duplexes contained no single-stranded molecules. Alternatively, the duplexes containing the interstrand cross-links were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide, 8m urea denaturing gel, and the single bands corresponding to interstrand cross-linked duplexes were cut off from the gel, eluted, precipitated by ethanol, and dissolved in a solution consisting of 10 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Both procedures of the purification of interstrand cross-linked duplexes provided products of which subsequent analysis (see below) gave identical results. The yields of these interstrand cross-linking reactions were ∼15 and 30% for cisplatin and transplatin, respectively. The duplexes were still further analyzed for platinum content by FAAS. Additional quantitation of cross-linked duplex by UV absorption spectrophotometry was used to ascertain that 1:1 adducts (one Pt/duplex) had formed. The sites involved in interstrand cross-links were deduced in the same way as described earlier (10Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar,27Brabec V. Reedijk J. Leng M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12397-12402Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 28Brabec V. Sip M.

It was verified in this way that the interstrand cross-link of cisplatin was formed between guanine residues in neighboring base pairs in the 5′-GC·5′-GC central sequence, whereas the interstrand cross-link of transplatin was formed between central guanine residue in the top strand of the d(TGCT)·d(AGCA) duplex and its complementary cytosine residue. FPLC purification and FAAS measurements were carried out on an Amersham Biotech FPLC system with MonoQ HR 5/5 column and a Unicam 939 AA spectrometer equipped with a graphite furnace, respectively. The concentration of the purified and characterized duplexes containing the interstrand cross-link of cisplatin and transplatin was further estimated by determining the platinum concentration by means of FAAS. Other details can be found in previously published papers (10Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 28Brabec V. Sip M.

Excess heat capacity (ΔCp) versus temperature profiles for the thermally induced transitions of d(TGCT)·d(AGCA) duplex, unmodified or containing a unique interstrand cross-link of cisplatin or transplatin, were measured using a VP-DSC calorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, MA). In these experiments, the heating rate was 60 °C/h and a maximum temperature was 95 °C. Enthalpies (ΔHcal) and entropies (ΔScal) of duplex formation were calculated from the areas under the experimental ΔCp versus T and the derived ΔCp/T versus T curves, respectively, using ORIGIN version 5.0 software (Microcal). The free energy of duplex formation at 25 °C (ΔG25) was calculated using the standard thermodynamic relationship given in Equation 1 and the corresponding values of ΔH and ΔS. ΔG25=ΔH−(298.15)ΔSEquation 1 The oligonucleotide duplexes at the concentration of 10 μm were dialyzed against the buffer containing 10 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The samples were vacuum-degassed before the measurement. It was also verified in the same way as described in the previous paper (21Poklar N. Pilch D.S. Lippard S.J. Redding E.A. Dunham S.U.

A. 1996; 93: 7606-7611Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) that the melting transition of both the platinated and unmodified duplexes were fully reversible. UV absorbance measurements were conducted on a Beckman DU-7400 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermoelectrically controlled cell holder and quartz cells with a path length of 1 cm. Absorbance versus temperature profiles were measured at 260 nm. The temperature was raised using linear heating rate of 1.0 °C/min. For each optically detected transition, the melting temperature (Tm) was determined as described previously (16Zaludova R. Kleinwächter V. Brabec V. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 60: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The DNA solutions ranged from 0.2 to 10 μm in duplex and contained 10 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA. CD spectra were recorded using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermoelectrically controlled cell holder. The cell path length was 1 cm. Isothermal CD spectra were recorded from 220 to 320 nm in 1-nm increments with an averaging time of 5 s. The DNA concentration was 6 μm in duplex, and buffer conditions were 10 mm sodium cacoldylate (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements were conducted to characterize the thermally induced denaturation of the 20-bp duplex with the specific goal of elucidating the thermal and thermodynamic consequences of modifying and constraining DNA via a single, site-specific interstrand cross-link of antitumor cisplatin or its clinically ineffective trans isomer (Fig.1). The cross-links were formed in the center of these duplexes between the nucleotide residues preferentially involved in these adducts when high molecular mass DNA is globally modified by cisplatin or transplatin, i.e. between guanine residues in neighboring base pairs in the sequence 5′-GC·5′-GC in the case of cisplatin cross-link (30Lemaire M.A. Schwartz A. Rahmouni A.R. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1982-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) or between guanine and complementary cytosine of the same duplex in the case of the cross-link formed by transplatin (10Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The results of these studies are shown in Fig.2 with the associated data listed in Table I. Denaturation (heating) and renaturation (cooling) curves for the unmodified and the platinated duplex were superimposable, which is consistent with the reversibility of this melting equilibrium. Thus, meaningful thermodynamic data from our calorimetric and spectrophotometric measurements described below could be obtained. In addition, the pre- and post-base lines coincide for both unmodified and platinated duplexes, which suggests no differential heat capacity change resulting from the presence of the cross-link. Comparing the calorimetrically determined melting temperatures (Tm) for the cross-linked duplexes and for the unconstrained (unplatinated) duplex reveals that formation of either cross-link results in a substantial increase in the thermal stability of the duplex (ΔTm (defined as the difference between Tm values of the cross-linked and unplatined duplex) was +8.7 or +5.0 °C for the cross-link of cisplatin or transplatin, respectively).Table ICalorimetrically derived thermodynamic parameters for the formation of the 20-mer duplex d(TGCT)·d(AGCA), unplatinated or containing a single, site-specific interstrand cross-link of cisplatin or transplatinUnplatinated duplexDuplex cross-linked by cisplatin1-aThe interstrand cross-link of cisplatin was formed between guanine residues contained in the adjacent base pairs in the central sequence 5′-GC·5′-GC.Duplex cross-linked by transplatin1-bThe interstrand cross-link of transplatin was formed between central guanine residue in the top strand and its complementary cytosine residue.Tm(°C)1-cTm denotes the temperature corresponding to the maximum in the DSC melting profile.

Open table in a new tab The Tm, ΔHcal and ΔScal values are averages derived from three independent experiments. The unconstrained (unplatinated) duplex denatures in a bimolecular reaction to form two single strands. As a consequence, melting of the unplatinated duplex was dependent on the overall oligonucleotide concentration. For instance, increasing the duplex concentration from 0.2 to 10.0 μm increased the Tm of the unplatinated duplex from 61.5 to 68.8 °C. In contrast, the duplexes containing the interstrand cross-link of cisplatin or transplatin melted in a concentration-independent manner to a single-stranded state, which is consistent with the expectation that the molecularity had been reduced from bimolecular to monomolecular. Thus, the observed ΔTm differences could also result from the change in molecularity. To support this assumption, we performed a “correction” for the concentration dependence of theTm in the bimolecular unplatinated duplex following the general procedure outlined by Marky and Breslauer (31Marky L.A. Breslauer K.J. Bioploymers. 1987; 26: 1601-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Using this approach and our calorimetrically determined enthalpy (Table I), we estimated a reduced concentration-independent Tm of our unplatinated duplex as 88.1 °C. This “reduced”Tm value of the unplatinated duplex is significantly different from the Tm values of the cross-linked duplexes. Hence, the overall impact of the single interstrand cross-link of cisplatin or transplatin should not be associated only with the change in molecularity of the duplex system but another mechanism affecting the thermal stability of the duplex also has to be involved (32Osborne S.E. Völker J. Stevens S.Y. Breslauer K.J. Glick G.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11993-12003Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The transition entropy for a bimolecular complex depends on strand concentration. To eliminate the effect of different molecularities of the unplatinated and interstrand cross-linked oligomer systems, we also performed a correction for this concentration dependence again using the general procedure outlined by Marky and Breslauer (31Marky L.A. Breslauer K.J. Bioploymers. 1987; 26: 1601-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar) to calculate a reduced entropy (ΔS*) (TableI) from the observed ΔScal values. A comparison of the calorimetrically obtained enthalpy (ΔHobs) and reduced entropy (ΔS*) values for unplatinated duplex with those measured for the duplex containing the interstrand cross-link of cisplatin revealed a significant decrease of the change of enthalpy of duplex formation by 18 kcal/mol and an increase in the reduced duplex entropy (ΔΔS* = 37 cal/K · mol so thatTΔΔS* = 11 kcal/mol at 25 °C). In other words, the structural perturbation resulting from the interstrand cross-link of cisplatin increases entropy of the duplex and in this way entropically stabilizes the duplex. Thus, the 18 kcal/mol en"

So far, only the atrial natriuretic peptide and α-cardiac actin genes have been identified as cardiac-specific targets of Nkx2.5 (8Grepin C. Dagnino L. Robitaille L. Haberstroh L. Antakly T. Nemer M.

Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). This protein is highly expressed in the embryonic heart and, similar to Nkx2.5, knockout of the calreticulin gene is lethal during embryogenesis (14.5–16.5-day-old embryos) because of impaired cardiac development (12Mesaeli N.

These findings suggest the existence of well defined mechanism(s) for activation and repression of the calreticulin gene in the developing heart. The mechanisms that control the expression of calreticulin in the developing heart are not known. However, it is known that the promoter of the mouse calreticulin gene includes putative binding sites for NKx2.5 (13Waser M. Mesaeli N. Spencer C. Michalak M. J.

Here we show that the transcription factor Nkx2.5 activates expression of the calreticulin gene in the heart. We also show that binding of COUP-TF1 to the Nkx2.5 binding site suppresses transcription from the calreticulin promoter. Nkx2.5 and COUP-TF1 may play antagonistic roles in regulating the expression of calreticulin during cardiac development. pLC1 and calreticulin promoter deletion/mutation plasmids were generated as described by Waser et al. (13Waser M. Mesaeli N. Spencer C. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The 1 × CRT1 site 2- and 4 × CRT site 2-luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed by inserting synthetic deoxyoligonucleotides upstream of the minimal calreticulin promoter (13Waser M. Mesaeli N. Spencer C. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was purified by Qiagen column chromatography. Primary myocyte cultures were prepared from neonatal Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (14Moor A.N. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22985-22992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Primary cardiomyocytes or NIH3T3 cells were transfected with appropriate plasmid DNA, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity assays were carried out as described previously (13Waser M. Mesaeli N. Spencer C. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the CRT sites 2 and 3 was carried out using a mutagenesis kit from CLONTECH. The AAGTG nucleotide sequence in the CRT site 2 or site 3 was changed to a CCCCG sequence. An 11-day mouse embryo Matchmaker cDNA library (CLONTECH) was screened for interactions with the CRT site 2 response element. Three tandem repeats of the CRT site 2 element (5′-CTCAAGTGT-3′) were cloned intoEcoRI and XbaI restriction sites of pHISi, and into EcoRI and SalI sites of pLacZi, generating pHIS-Nkx and pLacZ-Nkx, respectively. Screening of the library was carried out as recommended by the manufacturer. Full-length COUP-TF1, Nkx2.5, and luciferase proteins were synthesized using a coupled transcription and translation reticulolysate system. Plasmids pRC-CMV/COUP-TF1, encoding recombinant COUP-TF1 (15Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), and pSPUTK/Nkx2.5, encoding recombinant Nkx2.5, were used. The two complementary deoxyoligonucleotides were labeled with [γ32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4 polynucleotide kinase. EMSA was carried out as described (16Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Mouse heart tissue was homogenized, and solubilized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with goat anti-calreticulin or mouse anti-Nkx2.5 antibodies (17Michalak M. Burns K. Andrin C. Mesaeli N. Jass G.H. Busaan J.L. Opas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29436-29445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was detected with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by a standard ECL development reaction. Fig. 1 shows that Nkx2.5 (18Komuro I. Izumo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8145-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and calreticulin (12Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.-H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) are both highly expressed in embryonic hearts (day 13 (E13) and 15 (E15)) and that the expression of both proteins decreases dramatically after birth (Fig. 1 A). We did note, however, that in embryonic hearts from 13-day-old embryos (Fig. 1, E13) the expression of calreticulin was significantly higher than that of the Nkx2.5 transcription factor. Western blot analysis also shows that COUP-TF1 was expressed in both embryonic and postnatal hearts, and the relative level of COUP-TF1 did not change significantly during cardiogenesis (Fig. 1 A). Relatively high expression of Nkx2.5 and calreticulin in embryonic hearts is consistent with suggestions that these proteins play a role in cardiac development (7Lyons I. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Li R. Andrews J.E. Robb L. Harvey R.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1654-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 12Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.-H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). These finding also indicate that Nkx2.5 might be responsible for activation of the calreticulin gene during development of the embryonic heart. To test this, we cotransfected NIH3T3 cells or rat primary cardiomyocytes with an Nkx2.5 expression vector and a vector (pLC1) containing the luciferase reporter gene. In pLC1, expression of the luciferase reporter gene is controlled by 1.8 kilobases of the calreticulin promoter region. pSVβ-galactosidase was used as an internal control. Fig.1 B shows that this cotransfection resulted in significant induction of luciferase activity in both NIH3T3 cells and in cardiomyocytes. Cells transfected with promoterless control plasmids showed no detectable luciferase activity (data not shown). Thus, it appears that Nkx2.5 can activate transcription from the calreticulin promoter, in vivo, in both NIH3T3 cells and in cardiomyocytes. Calreticulin has not previously been described as a gene target for the Nkx2.5 transcription factor. The expression of Nkx2.5 is restricted to the heart and heart progenitor cells from very early on in embryonic development (18Komuro I. Izumo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8145-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Therefore, Nkx2.5 is one transcription factor that probably plays a critical role in activating the calreticulin gene in the embryonic heart. Comparison between the Nkx2.5 response element in the calreticulin promoter (5′-CTCAAGTGT-3′ (antisense 5′-GAGTTCACA-3′)) and the consensus sequence for COUP-TF1 binding to DNA (5′-(A/G)G(G/T)TCA-3′) (Fig.2 A) (15Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) indicates that the Nkx2.5 response element is also likely a COUP-TF1 binding site. In the heart, the expression of calreticulin is down-regulated after birth (12Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.-H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms responsible for this repression are not known. It has been shown previously that COUP-TF1 can inhibit the action of nuclear receptors by binding competitively to their DNA binding sites (15Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 19Liu Y. Yang N. Teng C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1836-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Leng X. Cooney A.J.

To test whether COUP-TF1 affects transcriptional activity of the calreticulin promoter, we cotransfected NIH3T3 cells with the pLC1 vector (the luciferase gene controlled by the calreticulin promoter) and with increasing amounts of a COUP-TF1 expression vector. Fig. 2 B shows that COUP-TF1 repressed transcription from the calreticulin promoter, and this repression was concentration-dependent. When cells were transfected with 1 or 3 μg of the COUP-TF1 expression vector there was greater than 70% repression of calreticulin promoter activity (Fig. 2 B). Because the COUP-TF1 and Nkx2.5 binding sites in the calreticulin promoter overlap, we investigated whether COUP-TF1 and Nkx2.5 exhibit cooperation in regulating transcription of the calreticulin gene. First, we cotransfected cells with the pLC1 vector and the COUP-TF1 expression vector. Fig. 2 C shows that, as before, coexpression of COUP-TF1 decreased the activity of the calreticulin promoter. However, when we transfected cells with the pLC1 vector, the COUP-TF1 expression vector, and the Nkx2.5 expression vector, it was evident that Nkx2.5 abolished the COUP-TF1-dependent suppression of calreticulin promoter activity (Fig. 2 C). We also carried out a converse experiment. Cells were transfected with pLC1 vector, a constant amount of the Nkx.25 expression vector, and increasing amounts of COUP-TF1 expression vector. Fig. 2 Cshows that under these conditions Nkx2.5 also exhibited a dominant effect on the calreticulin promoter. Fig. 3 shows a schematic representation of the calreticulin promoter and the position of 3 putative Nkx2.5 elements, designated CRT sites 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Deletion analysis revealed that COUP-TF1 effectively repressed transcriptional activity when all three sites (1, 2, and 3) were present in the promoter (Fig. 3). Deletion of sites 1 and 3 did not affect the repression, whereas the deletion of site 2 effectively abolished it (Fig. 3). The highest activation of the calreticulin promoter by Nkx2.5 was also dependent on the presence of the site 2 (not shown). We conclude that COUP-TF1 represses transcription from the calreticulin promoter and that it does this via interaction with the calreticulin promoter at a putative binding site termed CRT site 2. To demonstrate specific binding of COUP-TF1 to the Nkx2.5 response element, we carried out an EMSA. We used recombinant COUP-TF1 and a [32P]-labeled synthetic deoxyoligonucleotide corresponding to the 3 tandem repeats of the CRT site 2. Fig.4 A shows that COUP-TF1 bound to the [32P]-labeled deoxyoligonucleotide (lanes 1–3). It also shows that this binding was competed out in the presence of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled the CRT site 2 deoxyoligonucleotide (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). Luciferase, which was synthesized in vitro with a coupled transcription and translation system, did not bind to the element. We conclude that COUP-TF1 binds specifically to the CRT site 2 in the calreticulin promoter. COUP-TF1 recognizes the consensus sequence (5′-(A/G)G(G/T)TCA-3′). It binds with highest affinity as a homodimer to a direct repeat of 5′-AGGTCA-3′ separated by a single base space, termed the DR1 element (15Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). To determine whether COUP-TF1 binds to the CRT site 2 element as a homodimer we carried out an EMSA. We compared binding of COUP-TF1 to the CRT site 2 (Fig. 4 B, lane 1) and to DR1 (Fig.4 B, lane 2). We expected that if COUP-TF1 binds to the CRT site 2 element as a homodimer, then the COUP-TF1·CRT site 2 complex would have a similar electrophoretic mobility to the COUP-TF1·DR1 complex. Fig.4 B shows that the electrophoretic mobility of the COUP-TF1·CRT site 2 complex (lane 1) was identical to that of the COUP-TF1·DR1 (lane 2). This result indicates that the COUP-TF1 protein binds to the CRT site 2 response element as a homodimer. To further investigate the role of the CRT site 2 in COUP-TF1-dependent repression of calreticulin promoter activity, we constructed plasmids with the luciferase reporter gene under the control of either 1 or 4 copies of the CRT site 2 response element (5′-CTCAAGTGT-3′). In both cases, the element(s) were placed upstream of a minimal calreticulin promoter (−173 to +40 encompassing the TATA and SP1 sites) (13Waser M. Mesaeli N. Spencer C. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We then cotransfected NIH3T3 cells with a COUP-TF1 expression vector and one of the luciferase reporter constructs. When COUP-TF1 was cotransfected with a reporter construct containing 1 copy of the CRT site 2 element, 36% inhibition of calreticulin promoter activity was observed (Fig. 4 C). When COUP-TF1 was cotransfected with a reporter construct containing 4 copies of the element, 50% inhibition of calreticulin promoter activity was observed (Fig. 4 C). To demonstrate that COUP-TF1 binds to the CRT site 2 in the calreticulin promoter in vivo, we carried out a yeast one-hybrid screen. We screened an embryonic (11-day) mouse cDNA library, fused to a GAL4 activation domain, using the CRT site 2 response element (5′-CTCAAGTGT-3′) as bait. A total of 1.2 × 106 yeast transformants were screened. We isolated 18 positive clones, which grew on His−/Leu− plus 15 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole over 5 days at 30 °C. Two of the 18 positive clones encoded the N-terminal region of COUP-TF1, indicating that COUP-TF1 bound to the CRT site 2 response element in vivo. Our results suggest that cooperation may occur, between COUP-TF1 and Nkx2.5, at the calreticulin promoter. To study this further, we used an EMSA to measure the binding of COUP-TF1 to the synthetic CRT site 2 in the presence of Nkx2.5. As expected, both COUP-TF1 (Fig.5, lane 1) and Nkx2.5 (Fig. 5,lane 5) bound to the CRT site 2. However, the CRT site 2·COUP-TF1 complex was significantly larger than the CRT site 2·Nkx2.5 complex (Fig. 5, compare lanes 1 and5). Recombinant Nkx2.5, in increasing amounts, efficiently competed with COUP-TF1 for the DNA binding site, favoring formation of the faster migrating CRT site 2·Nkx2.5 complex (Fig. 5, lanes 2–4). In contrast, although COUP-TF1 was able to compete with Nkx2.5 to some extent, it did so with a much lower affinity (Fig. 5,lanes 6–7). COUP-TF1 can form heterodimers with other nuclear receptors and inhibit their activity (19Liu Y. Yang N. Teng C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1836-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To determine whether COUP-TF1 and Nkx2.5 interact directly with each other, in vivo, we performed coimmunprecipitation experiments. We cotransfected NIH3T3 cells with HA-tagged Nkx2.5 and with COUP-TF1. We then immunoprecipitated nuclear extracts with anti-HA antibodies and immunoblotted the precipitates. Our Western blot analysis, with anti COUP-TF1 antibodies, revealed that Nkx2.5 and COUP-TF1 did not coimmunoprecipitate (data not shown), indicating that these two transcription factors do not form a heterodimer. During cardiogenesis there is a requirement for high expression of Nkx2.5, to activate cardiac-specific genes. In this study we demonstrate that, in the heart, the calreticulin gene is also a target for the transcription factor Nkx2.5. We also show that COUP-TF1 suppresses transcription of the calreticulin gene and that Nkx2.5 and COUP-TF1 bind to a common element in the calreticulin promoter. Apparently, these transcription factors exhibit cooperation in regulating transcription of the calreticulin gene. Calreticulin gene knockout is embryonic-lethal, resulting from impaired cardiac development (12Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.-H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 24Rauch F. Prud'homme J. Arabian A. Dedhar S. St-Arnaud R. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of calreticulin in the newborn heart leads to severe pathology and death. 2K. Nakamura and M. Michalak, submitted for publication. Together, these observations indicate that cardiomyocytes are sensitive to changes in the abundance of calreticulin. Therefore, transcription of the calreticulin gene in cardiac cells is presumably tightly and specifically controlled. In particular, the evidence indicates a need for elevated expression of calreticulin during the early stages of cardiac development. However, this high level of expression must be reversed, because postnatal pathology is observed in mice overexpressing this protein.2 The present study indicates that the COUP-TF1 may be one transcription factor responsible for a postnatal repression of the calreticulin gene. Similar to calreticulin cardiac overexpresser mice, COUP-TF1-deficient mice die postnatally, indicating that COUP-TF1 is essential for postnatal survival (25Qiu Y. Pereira F.A. DeMayo F.J. Lydon J.P. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1925-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These animals display defects in development of the ninth cranial ganglion and nerve (25Qiu Y. Pereira F.A. DeMayo F.J. Lydon J.P. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1925-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Presently, there is no information on cardiac function and development and/or the expression pattern of calreticulin in COUP-TF1-deficient mice. We propose that Nkx2.5 plays a central role in activating calreticulin expression in the developing heart (Fig.6) by binding to CRT site 2. As we show in this study, binding of COUP-TF1 to the calreticulin promoter results in suppression of promoter activity. The presence of elevated Nkx2.5, during early cardiac development, minimizes the interaction of calreticulin promoter to COUP-TF1. Progressive down-regulation of Nkx2.5 expression, which occurs as cardiac development progresses and following birth, exposes the CRT site 2 binding site in the calreticulin promoter, permitting the interaction with COUP-TF1 (Fig.6). It is likely that other transcription factors may play an important role in the activation and suppression of the calreticulin gene during cardiogenesis. This work, however, implicates COUP-TF1 as one transcription factor contributing to the decline in calreticulin levels seen in the newborn/mature heart compared with those seen in the developing heart. We thank R. Rachubinski (University of Alberta) for a generous gift of anti-COUP antibodies."

Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 443-478Crossref Google Scholar). An effort to identify the evolutionary origin of leghemoglobins led to the discovery of plant nonsymbiotic hemoglobins (nsHbs)1 in several plant species (2Taylor E.R. Nie X.Z. Alexander W.M.

Homologous hemoglobins have also recently been discovered in bryophytes, which leads to the conclusion that these proteins are ubiquitous in the plant kingdom (8Arredondo-Peter R. Ramirez M. Sarath G. Klucas R.V. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1458Google Scholar). The discovery of nonsymbiotic hemoglobins was slowed by the fact that they are present in very low concentrations inside plants. The details of their in vivo expression and function are currently under investigation (9Arredondo-Peter R. Hargrove M.S. Moran J.F. Sarath G. Klucas R.V.

The biophysical properties of several nsHbs have been characterized and have provided important clues about possible physiological functions for this family of proteins (4Arredondo-Peter R.

Hexacoordination results from two His residues that bind the heme iron at the fifth and sixth coordination sites; one coordinates the proximal side of the heme iron, which is characteristic of all hemoglobins, and a second coordinates the distal side, which is traditionally the binding site for oxygen and other ligands. Hexacoordination has been observed in hemoglobins from bacteria; protozoa; several animal species, including humans; and an oxygen-sensing heme protein from Escherichia coli (12Scott N. Lecomte J.

Therefore, the mechanism of using displaceable coordination for regulating heme protein function has been established. Despite this potential inhibition of ligand binding, nsHbs reversibly bind oxygen and other ligands with very high affinities (9Arredondo-Peter R. Hargrove M.S. Moran J.F. Sarath G. Klucas R.V.

This structure reveals a homo-dimeric protein in the asymmetric unit, indicating that it can form a specific dimer independent of crystal packing. A ribbon model and details of the rHb1 dimer interface are shown in Fig.1. The interface is composed of the amino acid residues at the beginning of the CD helix region and the G helix. The interaction between the two subunits consists of a hydrogen bond between the side chain of Glu119 of one subunit and Ser49 on the other. These two polar interactions surround a hydrophobic core consisting of the side chains of Val46, Val120, and Phe123 of each subunit. The amino acid residues that make up this interface region are relatively conserved among the nsHbs (9Arredondo-Peter R. Hargrove M.S. Moran J.F. Sarath G. Klucas R.V. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1121-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17Hargrove M. Brucker E. Stec B. Sarath G. Arredondo-Peter R. Klucas R. Olson J. Phillips G. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1005-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (163) Google Scholar), indicating that the quaternary structures of other members of this family could be similar to rHb1. Quaternary structure plays an important role in the function of many hemoglobins by facilitating allostery and cooperativity for regulation of ligand binding. However, the solution quaternary structures of nsHbs have not yet been characterized in detail. Barley nsHb was reported by Duff et al. (11Duff S.M.G. Wittenberg J.B. Hill R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16746-16752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) to be dimeric, whereas rHb1 was initially reported to be monomeric (4Arredondo-Peter R. Hargrove M.S. Sarath G. Moran J.F. Lohrman J. Olson J.S. Klucas R.V. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The quaternary structures of other nsHbs have not yet been investigated. The discrepancy between the quaternary structure of rHb1 in crystals and in solution and between the solution quaternary structures of the nsHbs from barley and rice are the rationale for the characterization of rHb1 described here. In this work, the solution quaternary structure of rHb1 was investigated along with its effects on the rate and affinity constants for ligand binding and the rate constants characterizing hexacoordination by the distal His. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis of several conserved amino acids that make up the subunit interface was used to determine their effect on quaternary structure and ligand binding. These structural and biophysical characteristics of nsHbs are important for developing an understanding of the function of these proteins in vivo. All proteins were expressed and purified using the methods described by Arredondo-Peter et al. (4Arredondo-Peter R. Hargrove M.S. Sarath G. Moran J.F. Lohrman J. Olson J.S. Klucas R.V. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed in BL21(λDE3) E. coli cells using the pET system from Novagen without amino- or carboxyl-terminal tagging. This procedure results in bright red cell pellets and a red supernatant following cell lysis. All mutant proteins were generated using the Quickchange mutagenesis procedure available from Stratagene. Extinction coefficients for different ligated forms of wild type rHb1 were determined using the pyridine hemochromogen method described by Riggs (18Riggs A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 5-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Size exclusion analysis was performed at room temperature with a TSK-GEL G2000SWXL HPLC column from TOSOHAAS and a Varian Prostar HPLC system. 20-μl protein samples at concentrations ranging from 1 to 800 μm were analyzed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and retention time was defined as the midpoint of the absorbance chromatogram observed at 410 nm. The buffer used for all analyses was 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 100 mm NaCl. The ligated states were prepared using previously described methods (19Hargrove M.S. Barry J.K. Brucker E.A. Berry M.B. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Arredondo-Peter R. Dean J.M. Klucas R.V. Sarath G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Olson J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 631-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), except for the Fe(III)CN− sample that was in the above buffer and 5 mm NaCN−. Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed at 25 °C with a Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge using absorption optics. Sedimentation profiles were collected for samples at 25,000 and 30,000 rpm, and over protein concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 μm. Each sample was loaded into all three sectors of an equilibrium centerpiece, and all three sedimentation profiles contributed to data analysis. Apparent molecular mass at each concentration was determined by combining data from each sector of the centerpiece and each angular velocity using the Multi Fit global analysis software available from Beckman. Solvent density and partial specific volume were calculated using previously described methods that have been summarized by Beckman (21Durshlag H. Thermodynamic Data for Biochemistry and Bio/Technology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986Google Scholar, 22Johnson M.L. Frazier S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (510) Google Scholar). These values for our buffer system and rHb1 were 1.0126 g/ml and 0.7488 ml/g, respectively. All other graphic analyses, fitting of data, and figure preparation were carried out with the program Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Inc.). Estimates of error for final equilibrium dissociation constants were obtained from the absolute percent variation in at least three independent experiments. Oxygen and carbon monoxide association rate constants and oxygen dissociation rate constants were determined using previously described methods (19Hargrove M.S. Barry J.K. Brucker E.A. Berry M.B.

Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 631-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Measurement of the rate constants for the association and dissociation of the distal His and the flash photolysis apparatus used in all experiments have been described by Hargrove (23Hargrove M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2733-2738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Accurate analysis of the concentration dependence of association requires absorption extinction coefficients specific to each ligated state of rHb1. Fig. 2 shows these absorbance spectra with the extinction coefficients plotted on the ordinate axis, and Table I lists specific extinction coefficients used for concentration determination at different wavelengths. The extinction coefficients for the ferric and deoxy proteins were identical to those previously reported (4Arredondo-Peter R. Hargrove M.S. Sarath G. Moran J.F. Lohrman J. Olson J.S. Klucas R.V. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These extinction coefficients are slightly smaller than other ferric hemoglobins but comparable in the reduced forms (24Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in their Reactions with Ligands.

Extinction coefficients in parentheses are in units of mm−1 cm−1. Fig. 3 A shows the concentration dependence of size exclusion HPLC retention time for ferric rHb1. The retention time at a low protein concentration (∼ 1 μm) was comparable to that of myoglobin (data not shown). As protein concentration was increased, retention time dropped to a value much smaller than that expected for monomeric rHb1 (18,418 Da). For a homodimer, the concentration dependence of the fraction of monomeric protein obeys the following equation, whereKd is the equilibrium dissociation constant,PT is the total protein concentration, andfm is the fraction of protein that is monomeric. fm=−KD+KD2+8KDPT4PTEquation 1 Assigning a retention time to the monomer and dimer and assuming rapid exchange in the reaction, the following equation can be used to describe the size exclusion HPLC results in Fig. 3 A;Sobs is the observed retention time,Sm is the retention time of the monomer,SD is the dimer retention time, andfm is the fraction of monomers as defined in Equation 1. Sobs=fmSm+(1−fm)SDEquation 2 The HPLC data were fit to Equation 2, yielding a retention time of 8.42 min for the monomeric protein and 7.66 min for dimeric protein. Although this analysis confirms dimerization, the equilibrium dissociation constant extracted from this fit (900 μm) is not accurate because the protein concentrations on the abscissa of Fig.3 A cannot easily be corrected for dilution of the samples on the HPLC column. Having established that rHb1 is a partially associated homodimer at micromolar concentrations, analytical ultracentrifugation was used to determine the concentration dependence of the fraction of monomeric protein. Using absorption to detect equilibrium sedimentation profiles limits the absorbance of the sample to ∼ 0.1–1.2A. For nsHbs, if both the Soret and visible absorption bands are exploited, experiments can be carried out between ∼1 and 50 μm in the Beckman equilibrium centerpiece. Fig. 3 B shows the dependence of apparent molecular mass on protein concentration for ferric rHb1. At very low concentrations, the protein appears monomeric, but the apparent molecular mass increases throughout the concentration range accessible in this experiment. The fitted curve in Fig. 3 B is a nonlinear least squares fit to Equation 2 with molecular mass substituted for retention time. From these data, fitted values for the equilibrium dissociation constant and the molecular masses for the monomeric and dimeric proteins were 80 μm (±10‥), 17,700 Da, and 35,200 Da, respectively. Fig.3 C shows the same data as Fig. 3 B, but with the fitted curve extrapolated to higher protein concentrations, indicating the concentration range over which fractional subunit association occurs for ferric rHb1. Analytical ultracentrifugation was also used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constants of several different ligated and oxidation states of wild type rHb1. These values for the O2, CO, and Fe(III)CN− forms of the protein are listed in Table II. Equilibrium dissociation constants for O2-, CO-, and CN-bound rHb1 were slightly larger than that of the ferric protein. However, deoxy rHb1 associates with a Kd >6-fold higher than that of ferric rHb1, indicating a much weaker dimerization interaction.Table IIEquilibrium dissociation constants for different ligated and oxidation states of rHb1Dissociation constants for rHb1μmnsrHb(III)80nsrHb(III)CN−110nsrHb(II)deoxy610nsrHb(II)CO140nsrHb(II)O2180The oxidation states are listed in Roman numerals along with the bound ligand (if present).

Open table in a new tab The oxidation states are listed in Roman numerals along with the bound ligand (if present). Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined using equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation. In an effort to test the importance of the amino acid side chains in the dimer interface, several of these interface residues were replaced by different amino acids using site-directed mutagenesis. The Ser49 to Ala49 (S49A), Glu119 to Val119 (E119V), and double substitution (S49A/E119V) mutant proteins were used to determine the role in dimerization of the symmetric electrostatic interactions at each end of the subunit interface. The substitutions V46N, V120N, and V46N/V120N were used to determine the importance of the hydrophobic core in dimerization. The quaternary structures of the resulting mutant proteins were analyzed, and rate constants for oxygen and carbon monoxide binding were measured to test the impact of any quaternary structural changes on ligand binding. Table III lists the observed molecular masses for the mutant proteins as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation. Each protein was assayed over a total protein concentration range of ∼10 to ∼50 μm. At these concentrations, the wild type protein exhibits a molecular mass significantly larger than that expected for monomeric protein. However, each of the interface disruption mutant proteins has the molecular mass expected for its respective monomers at all measured protein concentrations (Table III).Table IIIApparent molecular masses and rate and equilibrium constants for ligand binding to rHb1 and several dimer interface mutant proteinsProteinmwobsk′O2k′COkO2KO2kDaμm−1s−1s−1μm−1Wild type rice nsHb24.2686.00.0381800S49A18.7795.80.0561400E119V18.7825.70.0551500S49A/E119V18.71056.40.0651600V46N18.9627.90.0441400V120N18.7726.90.0282500V46N/V120N17.7655.70.0441500mwobs is the molecular weight value determined from analytical ultracentrifugation at a protein concentration of 50 μm(a monomer of any of these proteins has a molecular mass of ∼ 18.4 kDa). k′O2 and k′CO are the bimolecular rate constants for oxygen and carbon monoxide binding, respectively, and kO2 is the dissociation rate constant for oxygen.

Open table in a new tab mwobs is the molecular weight value determined from analytical ultracentrifugation at a protein concentration of 50 μm(a monomer of any of these proteins has a molecular mass of ∼ 18.4 kDa). k′O2 and k′CO are the bimolecular rate constants for oxygen and carbon monoxide binding, respectively, and kO2 is the dissociation rate constant for oxygen. KO2 is the association equilibrium constant for oxygen binding (the ratio ofk′O2 to kO2). Each mutation prevents subunit association but has little effect on rate constants for ligand binding. Rate constants for O2 and CO binding are given in Table IIIfor each of the dimer interface mutant proteins. There are no substitutions resulting in rate constants that deviate more than 2-fold from those of the wild type protein for any of the reactions measured. In addition, the reactions with wild type rHb1 were measured over a concentration range of 1–50 μm with no effect on rate constants for oxygen or carbon monoxide binding (data not shown). Laser flash photolysis as a function of CO concentration can be used to determine the rate constants for binding and dissociation of the hexacoordinating His73 side chain (23Hargrove M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2733-2738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The rate constants extracted from a two-exponent fit of CO rebinding after photolysis were used to extract these values using the following equations (where γ1 and γ2 are the two rate constants associated with rebinding). γ1+γ2=k−H+kH+kCO′[CO]Equation 3 γ1γ2=k−HkCO′[CO]Equation 4 Plots of the sum and product of γ1 and γ2 versus CO concentration are shown in Fig.4 for the S49A mutant protein, which, as indicated in Table III, is completely monomeric at the protein concentration used in this experiment (30 μm). Thesolid lines in Fig. 4 are linear least squares fits to these data. The slope of Fig. 4 A (obeying Equation 3) is the bimolecular rate constant for CO binding. Dividing this value into the slope of Fig. 4 B (obeying Equation 4) yieldsk–H. Subtracting k–H from they intercept of Fig. 4 A returnskH (as indicated in Equation 3). These values for the S49A mutant protein are 5.8 (± 6‥) μm−1s−1(k ′CO), 590 (± 10‥) s−1 (kH), and 1950 (± 10‥) s−1 (k–H). The values for wild type rHb1 are 6.0 μm−1s−1, 520 s−1, and 1910 s−1, respectively (23Hargrove M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2733-2738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). rHb1 is a partially associated homodimer in the concentration range in which absorption spectroscopy is used for experimentation (∼ 1–1000 μm; Fig. 3 C). At a concentration of 0.8 mm, the protein is 90‥ associated, but at concentrations between 0.8 mm and ∼ 5 μm, significant variation in apparent molecular mass is observed. If the nsHb from barley has a similar equilibrium dissociation constant, the data presented here explain the difference between the quaternary states initially assigned to it and rHb1. It is likely that the higher concentrations of barley nsHb used for size exclusion chromatography indicated a molecular mass closer to that expected for the dimeric protein (11Duff S.M.G. Wittenberg J.B. Hill R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16746-16752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For example, if a protein concentration of 1 mm was used in these experiments, the apparent molecular mass would be ∼ 32,000 Da. The first examination of rHb1 quaternary structure used analytical ultracentrifugation, which requires much lower protein concentrations (∼ 3 μm). This experiment provided an apparent molecular mass of ∼ 19,000 Da, suggesting a monomeric protein (4Arredondo-Peter R. Hargrove M.S. Sarath G. Moran J.F. Lohrman J. Olson J.S. Klucas R.V. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A similar situation has recently been observed forVitreoscilla hemoglobin. The crystal structure reveals a dimeric protein to which had been attributed the ability to bind ligands cooperatively (25Tarricone C. Galizzi A. Coda A. Ascenzi P. Bolognesi M. Structure. 1997; 5: 479-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, a recent investigation of the solution properties of this protein using analytical ultracentrifugation indicates that it is monomeric when present in micromolar concentrations (26Giangiacoma L. Mattu M. Ascenzi P. Bolognesi M. Boffi A. Toulmond A. Lallier F.H. International Conference on Invertebrate Dioxygen Binding Proteins, Roscoff, France. Station Biologique de Roscoff, 2000: 51Google Scholar). These experiments have important implications with respect to cooperative ligand binding and potential protein function. The results presented here for rHb1 indicate that it could not possibly bind ligands cooperatively unless it is present at concentrations >1 mm inside plant tissue. It is unlikely that this is the case, as very little nsHb has ever been extracted from plant tissue (9Arredondo-Peter R. Hargrove M.S. Moran J.F. Sarath G. Klucas R.V. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1121-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to completely rule out the possibility of high local concentrations of protein compartmentalized in small intracellular areas. Understanding the physiological function of the nsHbs has been the focus of much research over the past several years. Current hypotheses result from the roles of hemoglobins in other systems in combination with biophysical and structural data for nsHbs that limit some of these possibilities. It has been suggested that extremely high oxygen affinities and low dissociation rate constants preclude the nsHbs from facilitating the diffusion of oxygen in the absence of some factor that could increase the dissociation rate constant at least 100-fold (5Trevaskis B. Watts R.A. Andersson C.R. Llewellyn D.J. Hargrove M.S. Olson J.S. Dennis E.S. Peacock W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Des. 2000; 8: 1005-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The results of the work presented here indicate that quaternary structural changes do not significantly affect ligand binding kinetics or rate constants associated with hexacoordination. Therefore, a change in quaternary structure is not a factor that could implicate the nsHbs as oxygen transport proteins. Table IV is a sequence alignment of the interface region of rHb1 with several other plant hemoglobins, including Parasponia hemoglobin, which is dimeric (27Appleby C.A. Tjepkema J.D. Trinick M.J. Science. 1983; 220: 951-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Gibson Q.H. Trinick M.J. Appleby C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13624-13631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and soybean leghemoglobin (Lba), which is monomeric. The residues which create the dimer interface in rHb1 are also found in the nsHbs from soybean, barley, corn, Arabidopsis nsHb1, andParasponia Hb. However, Arabidopsis contains a second nsHb that is predicted to be incapable of dimerization with respect to the criteria established here for rHb1 because it contains an Ala residue at position 49. The mutation creating a similar interface in rHb1 (S49A) results in a monomeric protein. Presumably Lba dimerization is prevented by the presence of hydrophobic residues at positions 49 and 119.Table IVThe rHb1 dimer interface regions aligned with homologous regions from several other plant hemoglobinsSequence alignments for plant hemoglobinsB helix and CD regionG helix45464-aThe indicated columns are the amino acids that create the dimer interface in the crystal structure of rHb1.

Open table in a new tab The phylogenetic conservation of the dimer interface in nsHbs indicates that it probably has some physiological role. It is possible that,in vivo, the interface serves as a binding site for another molecule and that the low affinity interaction resulting in dimerization is simply the consequence of the single, symmetric binding site on each protein molecule. This would explain why the interface residues are conserved among the nsHbs, but dimerization is a physiologically unlikely event. The plant nsHbs must undergo conformational change upon ligand binding (17Hargrove M. Brucker E. Stec B. Sarath G. Arredondo-Peter R. Klucas R. Olson J. Phillips G. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1005-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and are probably capable of binding a partner molecule via the interface region investigated in this work. Therefore, it is possible that nsHbs are molecular sensors that use heme ligation to trigger other physiological events. There are many examples of heme proteins that use coordination and redox properties to affect the behavior of partner molecules. Many of these proteins are heme-based sensors of small diatomic ligands like oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide (29Rodgers K.R. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). FixL, CooA, soluble guanylate cyclase, andECDos are examples of heme proteins that undergo a distal ligand displacement that produces conformational changes that affect covalently bound partner molecules (16Delgado-Nixon V. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 29Rodgers K.R. Curr. Opin. Chem.

A. 1997; 94: 11216-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). There is little change in association equilibrium for Fe(III)CN−, CO, and O2, but there is a 6-fold increase in the Kd of the Fe(II)deoxy protein compared with the ferric form. This could indicate that the interface region of deoxy rHb1 is less likely to interact with another protein and that ligation of the deoxy protein might trigger binding of a partner molecule. A similar redox and ligand-dependent quaternary structure has also been observed in the hemoglobin fromCaudina arenicola, one form of which exhibits reversible hexacoordination (32Mitchell D.T. Kitto G.B. Hackert M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33Galick R.L. Miller B.J. Riggs A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The possibility of forming heterodimeric nsHbs has not yet been investigated but is a potentially very important direction of research. If the α and β subunits of human hemoglobin had first been identified genetically and studied individually as recombinant proteins, quaternary structure and cooperativity would not have been observed until the subunits were studied together. This limitation of working with recombinant proteins must be considered when trying to identify physiological roles of the nsHbs."

The examples presented here may serve as a paradigm for enzyme targeting in other systems. myosin heavy chain bovine serum albumin glutathioneS-transferase myosin heavy chain kinase protease inhibitor cocktail polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]- amino}ethanesulfonic acid Complex cellular processes such as cytokinesis, cell migration, and receptor capping depend on the ability of myosin II (conventional myosin) to bring about contraction at specific locations within the cell (1Spudich J.A. Finer J. Simmons B. Ruppel K. Patterson B. Uyeda T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium, myosin II undergoes a dynamic assembly/disassembly process that permits its specific spatial and temporal localization within the cell (2Tan J.L. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In response to extracellular chemoattractants such as cAMP or folic acid, myosin II is recruited from the cytoplasm to the cell cortex in a process that involves myosin II bipolar filament assembly (3Yumura S. Cell Struct. Funct. 1994; 19: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Yumura S. Cell Struct. Funct. 1993; 18: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 5Newell P.C. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 445-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). MHC1 phosphorylation is the major route by which myosin filament assembly is controlled inDictyostelium. Phosphorylation of mapped sites at threonine residues 1823, 1833, and 2029 of MHC leads to disassembly of filaments both in vitro and in vivo (6Kuczmarski E.R. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7292-7296Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 7Vaillancourt J.P. Lyons C. Côté G.P. J. Biol.

The importance of these target sites in controlling myosin filament assembly has been demonstrated from studies showing that conversion of these threonines to aspartic acid residues creates a “pseudophosphorylated” myosin that is unable to assemble into the cytoskeleton. Conversely, myosin overassembles into the cytoskeleton if these regulatory sites are either removed by truncation of MHC (10Egelhoff T.T. Brown S.S. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or converted to nonphosphorylatable alanine residues (9Egelhoff T.T. Lee R.J. Spudich J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). MHC phosphorylation appears to be regulated in Dictyosteliumthrough the combined activities of at least one MHC phosphatase (11Murphy M.B. Egelhoff T.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 582-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and a group of MHC kinases (2Tan J.L. Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev.

Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 460-464Google Scholar). Dictyostelium MHC kinase (MHCK) A was the first of the heavy chain kinases to be purified. Subsequent characterization of purified MHCK A revealed that its catalytic activity can drive myosin filament disassembly in vitro by phosphorylating MHC (13Côté G.P. Bukiejko U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning and sequence analysis of the MHCK A gene has revealed that the catalytic domain of MHCK A is unrelated to any of the conventional protein kinases. As a result, MHCK A has become the prototype defining a new family of protein kinases (14Futey L.M. Medley Q.G. Côté G.P. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 523-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Ryazanov A.G. Ward M.D. Mendola C.E. Pavur K.S. Dorovkov M.V. Wiedmann M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

A structurally related kinase, MHCK B, has been identified and cloned from Dictyostelium via sequence homology to the catalytic domain of MHCK A. Although native MHCK B has not yet been purified, a bacterially expressed truncation of MHCK B phosphorylates MHC preferentially at the mapped regulatory sites discussed above (16Clancy C.E. Mendoza M.G. Naismith T.V. Kolman M.F. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11812-11815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Another Dictyostelium homologue of MHCK A that has been identified by cDNA and genomic sequencing has been named MHCK C, although it has not yet been characterized at the protein level (GenBankTM accession number AF079447). The MHCK A group of kinases in Dictyostelium share a conserved domain structure consisting of the novel kinase catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain containing seven tandem copies of the WD repeat motif. The WD repeat is a conserved amino acid motif that recurs four to sixteen times and is found in a large and heterogeneous family of proteins. The general makeup of the repeating unit, although not absolutely conserved among WD repeats, begins with a pair of GH residues followed by a variable core of about 36–46 amino acids and ends with the WD residues (17Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the β-subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex (Gβ) has revealed that its seven WD repeats fold into a ring-like β-propeller structure consisting of seven “blades” with each blade folded into a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet structure (18Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Although no structural information is available for the WD repeat domains of MHCK A, B, and C, the conservation of their seven repeats with those of the Gβ subunit indicates that the seven-bladed β-propeller structure is also likely to occur in theseDictyostelium proteins. Functionally, the WD repeat class of proteins has been implicated in the regulation of a number of cellular functions such as signal transduction, RNA processing, gene regulation, vesicular traffic, and cytoskeletal assembly; however, no common function or interaction has been attributed to the WD repeat domain specifically (17Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Insight on the function of the WD repeat domain of MHCK A has been gained from a previous study showing that a Dictyostelium-expressed truncation of MHCK A lacking its WD repeat domain (MHCK A-ΔWD) was unable to phosphorylate myosin II in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, MHCK A-ΔWD phosphorylated a soluble myosin-based peptide (MH-1) just as well as full-length MHCK A (19Kolman M.F. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16904-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the current report, we describe results from experiments exploring the structure/function relationship between the conserved WD repeat domains of MHCK A and MHCK B and the kinase activity of each enzyme. For these studies, the catalytic domains of MHCK A and MHCK B, either with or without their WD repeat domains, were expressed in bacteria as recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and then assayed for kinase activity toward several different substrates, including Dictyostelium myosin II. We found that the WD repeat domains of both MHCK A and MHCK B stimulate kinase activity toward myosin II substrate but not toward the other substrates tested. These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that MHCK B, like MHCK A, functions physiologically as an MHC kinase. Binding experiments presented here reveal that the mechanism by which the WD repeats promote kinase activity toward myosin substrate is likely to involve a direct interaction with myosin II. To our knowledge, this represents the first time a WD repeat domain has been shown to physically target an attached kinase domain to its substrate. All DNA manipulations were carried out using standard methods. For the MHCK A constructs, an intermediate plasmid (pMEX) containing the entire MHCK A DNA coding region was used to generate the inserts for the GST fusion vector. The numbers corresponding to the restriction sites are derived from the MHCK A DNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number P42527). For the pGST-A-CAT construct, pMEX was digested with HindIII (base pair 1493) and BstXI (base pair 2529), and the resultant 1036 base pair fragment was treated with Klenow polymerase (New England Biolabs) to yield blunt ends. The pGST-A-CAT construct was completed by ligating the 1036-base pair fragment into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then digesting with SmaI to generate an in phase fusion with GST. The pGST-A-CATWD construct was made in a similar manner, but the fragment was released from pMEX by digesting only withHindIII and then treating the fragment with Klenow polymerase to yield blunt ends. The upstream end is contained within a bacterial polylinker downstream of the native MHCK A termination codon. The 2.0-kilobase insert fragment was then ligated into pGEX-2T cut withSmaI. MHCK B constructs were made from an intermediate plasmid, pMM3.1, which contains the full-length cDNA-coding region of MHCK B (GenBankTM accession number P90648). pMM3.1 contains the entire downstream end of MHCK B and has an EcoRI linker inserted next to codon 13 at the upstream end of the MHCK B coding region. For the pGST-B-CAT construct, a 1.4-kilobase insert fragment was isolated from pMM3.1 using an internal EcoRV site (nt1391) that lies 3′ of the catalytic domain of MHCK B and anXbaI site in the upstream polylinker of pMM3.1. TheXbaI site was made blunt by treatment with Klenow polymerase and then ligated into pGEX-2T vector that had been digested withEcoRI and made blunt. This ligation recreated the upstream vector EcoRI site (junction of blunt EcoRI ligated with blunt XbaI). This plasmid insert also contains the EcoRI site that lies adjacent to codon 13 of the MHCK B coding region. Digestion of this intermediate with EcoRI was performed to cut at the upstream vector EcoRI site and at the internal EcoRI site. Subsequent recircularization yielded pGST-B-CAT, which has codon 13 of MHCK B fused directly to the upstream GST domain encoded by the vector and an artificial stop codon following residue 459 of MHCK B. This stop codon lies at a position ∼110 amino acids downstream of the conserved catalytic domain portion of the native protein. The pGST-B-CATWD construct was prepared in a similar fashion. pMM3.1 was digested with EcoRI, releasing a 2.2-kilobase restriction fragment that has the entire downstream end of the MHCK B coding region and an upstream EcoRI site adjacent to codon 13 of MHCK B. This fragment was ligated into pGEX-2T to yield pGST-B-CATWD. A GST fusion protein containing a 15-kDa segment of theDictyostelium myosin II heavy chain was expressed inEscherichia coli from the plasmid pGST2029. Construction of pGST2029 involved the subcloning of a segment of myosin II tail centered on the MHCK A target site mapped to position 2029 (7Vaillancourt J.P. Lyons C. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10082-10087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) expression plasmid. An 80-amino acid region of the myosin II gene spanning residues 1985–2064 was amplified using primers that introduced upstream and downstreamEcoRI restriction sites. The polymerase chain reaction product was cut with EcoRI and ligated into pGEX-3X vector digested with EcoRI. The resulting plasmid, pGST2029, was then electroporated into E. coli cells (strain BL21-DE3, Novagen) for expression. The four GST fusion proteins were purified in a similar manner. A 100-ml culture ofE. coli (BL21-DE3 strain, Novagen) containing each plasmid was grown overnight in a 37 °C shaker incubator. This culture was then used to inoculate (1:50 dilution) 1–2 liters of LB (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the cultures were grown at 37 °C to log phase (A600 of 0.6–1.0). At this time, cultures were cooled to 25 °C, and then 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to induce fusion protein synthesis. Induced cultures were incubated for 15–20 h at 25 °C on a rotating platform. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 5 min, and the resulting cell pellet was washed in 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, and then centrifuged again. The cell pellet was resuspended (5 ml/g of pellet weight) with Buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 175 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2× concentration of the protease inhibitor mixtures, PIC-I and PIC-II. PIC-I was added from a 1,000 × stock containing 2 mg/ml antipain, 10 KIU/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml benzamidine, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 5 mg/ml Pefabloc, and 10 mg/mll-1-chloro-3[4-tosylamido]-7-amino-2-heptanone-HCl N-α-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone in ddH2O. PIC-II (1,000×) contains 1 mg/ml chymostatin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, and 5 mg/mll-1-chloro-3-[4-tosylamido]-4-phenyl-2-butanone tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone in ethanol. All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Lysozyme (100 μg/ml, Sigma) was added to the resuspended cells. The cell mixture was sonicated in an ice water bath, and the resulting lysate was spun at 150,000 × g for 15 min to remove insoluble material. The cleared lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 to 5 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed several times with buffer A to remove unbound material. For samples used in autophosphorylation experiments, a dephosphorylation step was added by incubating (12 h at 4 °C) bead-bound fusion protein in Buffer A containing 50 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After incubation, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was removed by washing the beads with Buffer A. Bound fusion protein was then eluted with buffer A containing 30 mm glutathione (Sigma), and the eluate was dialyzed against 12.5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, in 40% glycerol. Aliquots were frozen on dry ice and then stored at −80 °C until used in assays. The GST-2029 fusion protein was prepared as described above but with the following modifications. A 1-liter culture of E. coli(BL21-DE3) cells containing the pGST2029 plasmid was grown to log phase at 37 °C, and then expression of the GST-2029 fusion protein was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. The culture was grown for 3 h at 37 °C, and then cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in Tris-buffered saline containing 175 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mg/ml pepstatin. The cell slurry was frozen in a dry ice/methanol bath and stored overnight in a −80 °C freezer. The following components were added after thawing the cells for purification of GST-2029: 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 100 μg/mll-1-chloro-3-[4-tosylamido]-4-phenyl-2-butanone tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 50 μg/mll-1-chloro-3[4-tosylamido]-7-amino-2-heptanone-HClN-α-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml lysozyme. After a 10-min incubation on ice, Sarkosyl was added to 1.5%, and the cells were sonicated until fully lysed. Triton X-100 (2%) was added prior to centrifuging the sonicate and the cleared supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 45 min at 4 °C. Unbound material was removed by washing the beads with buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Fusion protein was eluted from the washed beads using 10 mm glutathione in wash buffer. The peak of eluted protein was determined by Bradford assay (Pierce), and pooled fractions were treated with aquacide (CalBiochem) to concentrate. The resulting concentrate was dialyzed into 10 mm TES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and then stored in aliquots at −80 °C until used. Myosin was purified by a modification of the method of Aguado-Velasco,et al. (20Aguado-Velasco M. Aguado-Velasco C. Kuczmarski E.R. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), as has been described (11Murphy M.B. Egelhoff T.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 582-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, an initial actomyosin precipitate was subjected to several assembly/disassembly cycles followed by a final gel filtration step to remove residual actin. All kinase assays were performed at 25 °C in 10 mm TES, pH 7.0, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (250–400 Ci/mol), using recombinant kinases at 20–80 nm, as noted for each experiment. The substrates used in this study were MH-1 peptide, GST-2029 (38 kDa), and myosin (243 kDa). The peptide substrate MH-1 (RKKFGESEKTKTKEFL-amide) has been described previously (21Medley Q.G. Gariepy J. Côté G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8992-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and corresponds to the mapped MHCK A target site in the myosin II tail at residue 2029 (underlined in peptide above). For kinetic analysis of kinase activity, each of the substrates was used over a range of concentrations as noted for each experiment. For determination of MHC phosphorylation stoichiometry, myosin II was included in the reaction mix at a concentration of 0.42 μm. For myosin substrate specificity experiments, rabbit skeletal muscle myosin II (Sigma) and chicken gizzard myosin II (Sigma) were dialyzed againstDictyostelium myosin II storage buffer (5 mmTris pH 7.0 buffer containing 20% sucrose) prior to their addition to kinase reaction mixes. Unless indicated otherwise, each kinase was allowed to auto-phosphorylate for 10 min at 25 °C before starting the kinase reaction with the addition of substrate. Kinase reactions containing MH-1 peptide substrate were terminated by blotting a fraction of the reaction mixture onto P-81 filter paper (Whatman) and then processing the filter for scintillation counting (22Medley Q.G. Lee S.F. Côté G.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For reactions in which the substrate was either GST-2029 or myosin II, the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer at each time point, boiling for 2 min, and then performing SDS-PAGE on the samples. The resulting gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and protein bands of interest were excised for scintillation counting to quantify phosphate incorporation. Analysis of fusion protein autophosphorylation was performed by incubating the kinase constructs (200 nm) in the kinase reaction described above and then blotting a fraction of the reaction mix to P-81 filter paper as described for the peptide assay. Purified kinase constructs were subjected to SDS-PAGE with a series of known amounts of BSA on the same gel. After Coomassie Blue staining, the protein bands were quantified by scanning densitometry, and the concentration of each purified fusion protein was determined by comparing the densitometry values for the purified kinases with those of the BSA standards in the same gel. Centrifuge tubes used throughout these experiments were pretreated with Sigmacote (Sigma) and 3% BSA in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Kinase fusion proteins used in cosedimentation assays were precleared by centrifugation at 95,000 × g for 10 min in a Beckman Ti Tabletop Ultracentrifuge in a TLA 100.3 rotor. The resulting supernatants were transferred to clean centrifuge tubes and then mixed with the other binding assay components to give 40-μl reaction mixes containing 0.3 μm kinase fusion protein, 1.0 μm Dictyostelium myosin II, 0.1% BSA, 2.5 mm TES, pH 7.0, 40 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5% sucrose. Under these conditions, greater than 80% of the myosin II is in filaments (25Kuczmarski E.R. Tafuri S.R. Parysek L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2989-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After incubation for 10 min at 4 °C, the binding reactions were centrifuged for 10 min at 95,000 ×g, and equal volumes of pellet and supernatant fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The myosin II and BSA were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining of gels. The distribution of kinase fusion proteins in pellets and supernatants was determined from Western blots probed with anti-GST antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, NY). The relative amounts of kinase fusion protein in the pellet and supernatant fractions were quantified by densitometric analysis of the developed Western blots. In earlier studies, domain truncations of MHCK A were generated for expression inDictyostelium cells. Biochemical analysis of the purified constructs revealed that the WD repeat domain of MHCK A was necessary for efficient phosphorylation of intact myosin II but not for phosphorylation of a myosin-based peptide (MH-1) substrate (19Kolman M.F. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16904-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the current study, we explored further the role of WD repeat domains in defining the kinase activities of both MHCK A and its recently identified homologue, MHCK B. For this study, truncated forms of both kinases were constructed, expressed, and purified as GST fusion proteins either lacking or containing their WD repeat domains (Fig.1). The GST-A-CAT fusion protein construct contains the minimal region of MHCK A that is necessary for basal kinase catalytic activity (23Côté G.P. Luo X. Murphy M.B. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6846-6849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The GST-A-CATWD fusion protein encompasses this segment and the C-terminal WD repeat domain of MHCK A. In contrast to MHCK A, the catalytic properties of MHCK B have not been studied thoroughly, and nothing is known of the WD repeat domain contribution to MHCK B kinase activity. Although a fine level mapping of the catalytic domain of MHCK B has not been performed, comparison with the MHCK A sequence suggests that the region of MHCK B necessary for basal kinase catalytic activity is probably contained within residues 100–340 (16Clancy C.E. Mendoza M.G. Naismith T.V. Kolman M.F. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11812-11815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The GST-B-CAT fusion protein used in this study encompasses this region, and the GST-B-CATWD construct includes this region as well as the more distal WD repeat domain of native MHCK B. All of the constructs described above were expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1). The GST-A-CAT and GST-A-CATWD constructs were assayed for kinase activity toward intact myosin II. Initial experiments determining the time course of MHC phosphorylation by each of the GST fusion proteins revealed that only the GST-A-CATWD construct phosphorylated myosin efficiently (Fig.2 A). The GST-A-CAT construct exhibited kinase activity that was barely detectable above background levels. Similar results were obtained when GST-A-CAT and GST-A-CATWD activities were analyzed over a range of myosin II concentrations (Fig.2 B). Although kinetic parameters for MHC phosphorylation could not be determined because of the insolubility of myosin II substrate at higher concentrations (≥ 2 μm), these results clearly show that the presence of the WD repeat domain is required for efficient phosphorylation of myosin II by MHCK A. The recombinant GST-A-CAT and GST-A-CATWD fusion proteins were tested next for kinase activity toward the MH-1 peptide. MH-1 is a previously described (21Medley Q.G. Gariepy J. Côté G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8992-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) 16-residue peptide corresponding to the mapped MHCK A target site at residue 2029 of MHC. Both GST-A-CAT and GST-A-CATWD phosphorylated MH-1 substrate efficiently (Fig. 2 C and TableI) and exhibited specific activities within an order of magnitude to those reported previously for both native MHCK A (13Côté G.P. Bukiejko U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and recombinant MHCK A catalytic domain expressed as a His6-tagged fusion protein (Table I) (23Côté G.P. Luo X. Murphy M.B. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6846-6849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our results showing a lack of difference between the activities of GST-A-CAT and GST-A-CATWD toward MH-1 demonstrate that the presence or absence of the WD repeat domain does not affect the basic catalytic activity of MHCK A. Moreover, these results, together with the myosin II phosphorylation results described above, demonstrate unequivocally that the recombinant WD repeat domain is necessary and sufficient to stimulate MHCK A catalytic activity toward Dictyostelium myosin II.Table IMH-1 kinetics constants for GST fusion proteinsKinaseKmVmaxμmmol Pi/mol kinase/sNative MHCK A105 ± 104.8GST-A-CAT107 ± 150.81 ± 0.04GST-A-CATWD59 ± 6.20.62 ± 0.09GST-B-CAT75 ± 6.50.49 ± 0.06GST-B-CATWD60.6 ± 6.50.42 ± 0.02Kinetics constants (± S.E.) were estimated by fitting data of Lineweaver-Burk plots by linear regression analysis using the SigmaPlot program.

The lack of WD repeat targeting to the MH-1 peptide suggests that a larger structural target, perhaps filamentous myosin II, is needed for the WD repeat domain stimulatory effect. To characterize further the specificity and possible structural requirements for the WD repeat domain effect on kinase activity, the GST-A-CAT and GST-A-CATWD fusion proteins were tested for kinase activity toward a novel substrate, GST-2029. This substrate contains a GST domain fused to a 15-kDa segment of the Dictyostelium myosin II tail that is centered on the mapped MHCK A phosphorylation site at residue 2029 of MHC. GST-2029 lacks regions of the myosin tail necessary for bipolar filament assembly (24Lee R.J. Egelhoff T.T. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2875-2886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, previous studies ofDictyostelium myosin II, along with structure prediction analysis of the GST-2029 sequence, indicate that this construct, unlike the MH-1 peptide, is likely to form a coiled-coil dimer.

https://openalex.org/W2044203754,"Persistent c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation induces cell death. Different mechanisms are ascribed to JNK-induced cell death. Most of the JNK-apoptosis studies employ stress stimuli known to activate kinases other than JNK. Here we used overexpression of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) to activate selectively JNK in T lymphoma Jurkat cells. Similar to that reported previously, Fas ligand (FasL) expression was up-regulated by JNK activation. Dominant negative-FADD and caspase-8 inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp effectively inhibited MKK7-induced cell death, supporting a major involvement of FADD cascade. However, MKK7-induced cell death was not prevented by antagonist antibody ZB4 and Fas-Fc, indicating that Fas-FasL interaction is minimally involved. Confocal microscopy revealed that persistent JNK activation led to clustering of Fas. Our results suggest that, in contrast to that reported previously, JNK alone-induced death in Jurkat cells is FADD-dependent but is not triggered by Fas-FasL interaction. Persistent c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation induces cell death. Different mechanisms are ascribed to JNK-induced cell death. Most of the JNK-apoptosis studies employ stress stimuli known to activate kinases other than JNK. Here we used overexpression of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) to activate selectively JNK in T lymphoma Jurkat cells. Similar to that reported previously, Fas ligand (FasL) expression was up-regulated by JNK activation.

The critical role of JNK is also supported by the lack of apoptosis on hippocampal neurons in JNK3-deficient and in JNK1/JNK2 double knockout mice (15Yang D.-D. Kuan C.-Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M.

Different apoptotic molecules have also been attributed to JNK-triggered cell death. Activation of c-Jun by JNK seems to mediate part of the apoptotic events (17Leppa S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). MEKK1 or c-Jun induces FasL expression and the subsequent FasL-Fas interaction and cell death (6Faris M. Kokot N. Latinis K.

Alternatively, apoptosis could be induced by translocation of JNK into mitochondria followed by phosphorylation and inactivation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (20Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell.

In addition, the UV-induced mitochondrial death pathway is abrogated in the absence of JNK, further supporting mitochondria as the target of JNK (22Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.-D. Xu J. Turner T.K.

Most of JNK-inducing signals such as UV and cytotoxic drugs activate signals other than JNK. Even for the selective expression of MEKK1, Cdc42, or apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, activation of JNK is accompanied by stimulation of p38 and/or IκB kinase. In addition, the contribution of p38 to stress-activated apoptosis has been demonstrated (5Lee L.-F. Li G. Templeton D.J. Ying J.P.-Y. J. Biol.

We confirmed the previous notion that JNK activation leads to increased FasL expression in Jurkat cells. Blockage of FADD-initiated apoptotic pathway effectively prevented JNK-induced cell death. However, blockage of FasL-Fas interaction by antagonizing antibody or Fas-Fc did not affect MKK7-induced apoptosis, suggesting that FasL is minimally involved in JNK-mediated cell death. Our results clearly suggest that JNK induces apoptosis by a FADD-dependent but FasL-independent mechanism in Jurkat cells.

Jurkat T cells (1 × 107) were washed and resuspended in 0.6 ml of RPMI medium containing 1% glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, and 10–20 μg of plasmid DNA. The electroporation was performed in Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II at 260 mV and 975 microfarads. The cuvette was left on ice for 15 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for the indicated time for cell death and biochemical analysis. Jurkat T cells were transfected with pcDNA3, ΔMEKK1, or pcDNA3-MKK7α. Cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection, and 100–200 μg of lysate was precipitated with 1 μl of anti-JNK1 antibody 101 (31Meyer C.F. Wang X. Chang C. Templeton D. Tan T.H. J. Biol.

The kinase activity of the immune complexes was determined by using GST-c-Jun-(1–79) or myelin basic protein as substrates. The reaction mixtures were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography, and quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Apoptosis in bulk population was determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining. At the indicated times after treatment, cells were harvested and washed in phosphate-buffered saline twice and resuspended in hypotonic fluorochrome solution (50 μg/ml PI, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100) (33Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4401) Google Scholar). Cells were placed at 4 °C in the dark overnight, and DNA content was analyzed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). The fraction of cells with sub-G1 DNA content was assessed using the CELLFIT program (Becton Dickinson). For apoptosis in cells transiently transfected with MKK7α or ΔMEKK1, green fluorescence protein expression vector pGreen Lanten-1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was cotransfected. Cells were harvested at the indicated times, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and terminal dUTP nick-end labeling reaction was performed using FlowTACS kit (R & D Systems). The incorporated biotin-dUTP was labeled with Tri-Color-streptavidin (Caltag, Burlingame, CA). The green cells (GFP-positive) were then gated on FACScan, and the fraction of cell stained with Tri-Color was quantitated. Alternatively, PI staining was also used to determined the fraction of subdiploid cells in GFP-positive population. Jurkat cells were transfected with active MKK7α or MEKK1 by electroporation. We chose electroporation because the transfection efficiency was close to 30% as determined by cotransfection with GFP (Fig.1 A, R1). To assess the cell death induced by JNK activation, the population expressing GFP was gated in fluorescence-activated cell sorter, and the fraction of apoptotic cells labeled with biotin-dUTP was quantitated (Fig.1 A). Activation of JNK by MKK7α and MEKK1 in Jurkat cells led to 50% death 24 h after transfection (Fig. 1 B). We next examined whether the cell death observed was JNK-dependent. MKK7α and MEKK1 were equally effective in the JNK induction (Fig. 2 A). The specificity of MKK7α was further confirmed by its inability to activate p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, in contrast to the effective induction of p38 by MEKK1 and MKK3 (Fig. 2 B). The activation of JNK by MEKK1 or MKK7α was prevented by cotransfection of SEK-AL (Fig. 2 A). The exact mechanism how SEK-AL prevents MKK7α-induced activation of JNK is not completely clear. Presumably, the binding of SEK-AL with JNK (34Xia Y. Wu Z. Su B. Murray B. Karin M. Gene Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) would compete with the interaction of JNK with MKK7α. Inhibition of JNK activation by SEK-AL prevented MKK7α- or MEKK1- induced cell death (Fig. 2 C), indicating that the observed cell death is JNK-specific. Because MKK7α is a more specific activator of JNK, in the following experiments mainly the results of MKK7α transfection are shown. In all the criteria evaluated, MEKK1-induced apoptosis displayed an identical character.Figure 2JNK-dependent cell death induced by active MKK7 α. Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation with 3 μg of pGreen Lanten-1, with active pcDNA3-MKK7α, ΔMEKK1, or MKK3 (each 5 μg), with or without 10 μg of SEK-AL. Cell extracts were prepared 18 h after transfection. A, JNK activities were determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-JNK1 (31Meyer C.F. Wang X. Chang C. Templeton D. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8971-8976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun-(1–79). B, p38 activities were determined by precipitation with anti-p38 (32Jiang Y. Gram H. Zhao M. New L. Gu J. Feng L. Padova F.D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30122-30128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP). C, apoptosis was determined 24 h after transfection as described in Fig. 1.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5414-5424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there was a significant increase of FasL expression after transfection of MKK7α and MEKK1 as determined by immunoblots (Fig. 3 A). Despite a similar degree of JNK activation (Fig. 2), the extent of FasL expression was higher for MEKK1 transfection than MKK7α transfection. A likely cause is because MEKK1 also activates NF-κB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and both contribute to activation of the FasL promoter (35Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L.

Despite the increase of total cellular FasL, there was little increase in the surface FasL expression after MKK7α expression (Fig. 3 B, dark curve). As a positive control, TPA/A23187 treatment significantly promoted the surface FasL expression (Fig. 3 B, light curve). The expression of Fas is already high in Jurkat cells. Expression of active MEKK1 or MKK7α added little to the surface Fas expression (not shown). Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway is initiated by recruitment of FADD, followed by cleavage and activation of caspase-8 (39Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4526) Google Scholar). To examine whether MKK7α-induced cell death was indeed Fas-dependent, we used Fas-specific inhibitor DN-FADD, FLIP, and Z-IETD. DN-FADD competes with wild-type FADD (40Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E.

Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar); FLIP specifically antagonizes Fas-dependent cell death at the stage of FADD and caspase-8 (42Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schnedier P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.-L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar), and Z-IETD selectively inhibits caspase-8. Cotransfection with DN-FADD effectively inhibited MKK7α-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4). The expression of FLIP similarly inhibited MKK7α-induced apoptosis (not shown). The efficacy of caspase-8-specific inhibitor Z-IETD (50 μm) was first confirmed by blockage of CH11-induced apoptosis (not shown). The addition of Z-IETD 2 h after MKK7α transfection abrogated MKK7α-triggered apoptosis (Fig. 4). The inhibition of MKK7α-induced apoptosis by FLIP, DN-FADD, and Z-IETD supports the notion that FADD-mediated apoptotic pathway plays a major role in JNK-triggered cell death in Jurkat cells. To determine the role of Fas-FasL engagement in MKK7α-induced cell death, the antagonistic anti-Fas antibody ZB4 was used. Preincubation with ZB4 (250 ng/ml) effectively suppressed CH11-induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells (Fig.5 A). In contrast, the extent of Jurkat cell death resulting from MKK7α overexpression was indistinguishable in the presence or absence of ZB4 (Fig.5 B). We also used soluble Fas-Fc fusion protein to block the interaction of Fas and FasL. Fas-Fc (200 ng/ml) prevented FasL-induced cell death (Fig. 5 A), yet Fas-Fc failed to interfere with MKK7α-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells (Fig. 5 B). Because ΔMEKK1 induced higher expression of FasL (Fig. 3), we further examined whether ΔMEKK1-induced cell death could be inhibited by Fas-Fc or ZB4. Neither Fas-Fc nor ZB4 prevented apoptosis induced by ΔMEKK1 (not shown). The observations that Fas-Fc and ZB4 did not protect Jurkat cells from apoptosis suggest that the apoptosis induced by JNK is not mediated through Fas-FasL interaction. Stress stimuli such as UV, cycloheximide, cisplatin, etoposide, vinblastine, and doxorubicin may induce cell death by triggering Fas clustering in a FasL-independent manner (43Bennett M. McDonald K.

We also examined the surface Fas distribution on a macroscopic level before and after JNK activation using confocal laser scanning microscope. Fas was evenly distributed on the surface of the untransfected Jurkat cells (Fig.6 A). Treatment with sFasL led to increased aggregation of Fas on the surface of Jurkat cells (Fig.6 B). For cells transfected with MKK7α, as those marked by GFP expression (Fig. 6 C), there was a similar increased clustering of Fas on the surface of Jurkat cells as compared with the nearby untransfected cells (Fig. 6 D). Therefore, constitutive MKK7α expression promotes the aggregation of the surface Fas. JNK has been implicated as the major mediator of cell death induced by stress (1Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H.

We have also demonstrated, likely for the first time, that JNK-induced cell death in Jurkat cells is FasL-independent (Fig. 5). Our observations that Fas-Fc and ZB4 were unable to prevent MKK7α-induced cell death (Fig. 5) are in direct contradiction to the report of Faris et al. (6Faris M. Kokot N. Latinis K. Kasiblhatla S. Green D.R. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 134-144PubMed Google Scholar) that inducible expression of MEKK1 led to cell death which was prevented by soluble Fas and Fas antagonist antibody. We speculate the difference between their study and ours is likely due to the levels of Fas and FasL expression. In the study of Faris et al. (6Faris M. Kokot N. Latinis K. Kasiblhatla S. Green D.R. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 134-144PubMed Google Scholar), the inducible activation of MEKK1 in Jurkat led to an increase of surface FasL levels by 50-fold. This was accompanied by a 10-fold increase of surface Fas (see Fig. 5 in Ref. 6Faris M. Kokot N. Latinis K. Kasiblhatla S. Green D.R. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 134-144PubMed Google Scholar). With such high levels of Fas and FasL, Fas-FasL interaction would inevitably become the dominant process to trigger cell death. However, the levels of Fas and FasL induced by MEKK1 in their study are highly unphysiological, as judged from their report that there was a mere 50% increase of surface FasL with a 20% increase of surface Fas expression when Jurkat cells were activated with TPA/A23187 (6Faris M. Kokot N. Latinis K. Kasiblhatla S. Green D.R. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 134-144PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, despite an induction of total FasL content, surface FasL levels in Jurkat cells were minimally altered by JNK activation (Fig.3), and cell death proceeded in the absence of FasL binding. Fas-FasL interaction apparently is not essential for JNK-induced cell death in Jurkat cells. We have also repeated our observation in another T lymphoma EL4 (not shown) and reached an identical conclusion. FADD-dependent but FasL-independent cell death is triggered by UV, cycloheximide, cisplatin, etoposide, vinblastine, and doxorubicin through induced clustering of Fas (43Bennett M. McDonald K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7245-7252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), leading to the association of FADD with Fas and the subsequent activation of caspase-8. Fas aggregation-induced cell death is suppressed by DN-FADD or FADD antisense (44Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 45Micheau O. Solary E. Hammann A. Dimanche-Boitrel M.-T. J. Biol.

Similarly, MKK7-induced apoptosis is sensitive to inhibition by DN-FADD, FLIP, and Z-IETD (Fig. 4) and MKK7 overexpression triggered Fas clustering (Fig. 6), suggesting that JNK-activated apoptosis is mediated by Fas aggregation. We do not know the exact cellular process between the JNK activation and Fas clustering. Changes in the microtubule cytoskeleton may activate MEKK1 and JNK activation (47Yujiri T. Fanger G.R. Garrington T.P. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12605-12610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but whether persistent JNK activation could induce reorganization of the microtubule cytoskeleton that promotes Fas association remains to be determined. It may also be noted that our results on JNK-induced Fas oligomerization are compatible with the recent observation that Fas receptor is in trimer status before FasL binding (48Siegel R.M. Frederiksen J.K. Zacharias D.A. Chan K.K. Johnson M. Lynch D. Ysien R.Y. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2354-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). This is supported by the observation that the engagement of Jurkat cells by FasL led to a visible aggregation of Fas under the microscope (Fig. 6 D) as compared with untreated cells, supporting that the Fas aggregation observed by others and us (43Bennett M. McDonald K. Chan S.W. Luzio J.P. Simari R. Weissberg P. Science. 1998; 282: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 44Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A.

Therefore, Fas is trimerized in resting Jurkat cells but further aggregation is induced by stress stimuli or JNK activation. Our results may also help resolve the controversy on the involvement of FasL in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Despite the earlier reports that DNA-damaging agent-induced cell death is inhibited by Fas antagonizing antibody or Fas-Fc (32Jiang Y. Gram H. Zhao M. New L. Gu J. Feng L. Padova F.D. Ulevitch R.J.

Our demonstration that JNK triggers FADD-dependent apoptosis through induction of Fas aggregation, which does not require FasL in Jurkat cells, suggests one of the FasL-independent mechanisms that may be involved in the killing of Fas-sensitive cancer cells by chemotherapeutic agents is known to activate JNK. Our observation on JNK-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells, however, is not necessarily applicable to all types of cells. In neuronal cells, with the well established role of JNK and c-Jun in apoptosis induction (15Yang D.-D. Kuan C.-Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.-S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), Fas-FasL interaction mediates part of JNK-activated apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal (12Le-Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The difference in the degree of the FasL participation in JNK-induced cell death could be due to the different nature between T lymphocytes and cerebella granule neurons. Notably, a pivotal role of FADD in JNK-triggered apoptosis does not exclude other apoptotic mechanisms. MKK7-induced cell death was largely inhibited by FADD and Z-IETD (Fig. 4), yet a small fraction of death could still be detected even in the excess of DN-FADD and Z-IETD (not shown), suggesting the presence of apoptotic pathway not mediated by caspase-8. JNK is known to induce apoptosis in Fas-independent manner by phosphorylation and inactivation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (20Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 21Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Yoshida K. Pandey P. Kaneki M. Wang Q. Cheng K. Chen Y.-N. Campbell A. Sudha T. Yuan Z.-M. Narula J.

Together with the results from the present study, persistent activation of JNK is capable of triggering apoptotic pathways initiated by both mitochondria (22Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.-D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar) and death receptor. We speculate that the exact contribution from mitochondria and Fas pathway in JNK-mediated apoptosis would be determined by variables such as type of stress, type of cell, expression of Fas, and cellular sensitivity to Fas. Further characterization will help understand the exact molecular process triggered by JNK apoptotic signal in different cells.

Major processes regulated by phytochromes are seed germination, morphological changes of seedlings upon emergence from the soil (de-etiolation), growth rates of adult plants, and induction of flowering (1Neff M.M. Fankhauser C. Chory J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 257-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies using mutants revealed that the five phytochromes (phy1A–phyE) in the model plant Arabidopsis have both overlapping and distinct physiological functions (2Whitelam G.C. Devlin P.F. Plant Cell Environ. 1997; 20: 752-758Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Higher plant phytochromes are homodimers of subunits of about 120 kDa. Each subunit consists of two major domains. The N-terminal half is required for spectral integrity, whereas the C-terminal half mediates dimerization and interactions with signaling partners (3Quail P.H. Plant Cell Environ. 1997; 20: 657-665Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain has distant homology to histidine kinases of two component signaling systems. Phytochromes are, however, not histidine kinases but serine/threonine kinases (4Yeh K.-C. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13976-13981Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Several substrates for phytochrome kinase activity have been determined, but the involvement of phosphorylation in signal transduction remains to be proven. Phytochrome apoproteins incorporate the linear tetrapyrrol phytochromobilin, a reaction catalyzed by an intrinsic chromophore lyase activity (3Quail P.H. Plant Cell Environ. 1997; 20: 657-665Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The chromophore is bound via a thioester bond to a conserved cysteine in the N-terminal domain. Phycocyanobilin (PCB) of cyanobacteria can be incorporated to form a chromoprotein with a hypsochromic shift of about 10 nm and similar kinetic parameters to native phytochromes (5Braslavsky S.E. Gärtner W. Schaffner K. Plant Cell Environ. 1997; 20: 700-706Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The holoprotein can adopt two major conformations: the red-absorbing Pr form and the far red-absorbing Pfr form. Newly synthesized phytochrome is in the biologically inactive Pr form. Upon absorption of light, Pr will be converted into biologically active Pfr. Because the absorption spectra of Pr and Pfr overlap, irradiation with light establishes a photoequilibrium (ϕ), which is highest (∼0.8) around 660 nm and drops to 0.03 at 720 nm (6Mancinelli A.L. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg H.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluver Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1994: 211-270Crossref Google Scholar). Beside the light reactions, Pfr also converts thermally back into Pr by a process called dark reversion. Dark reversion has been suggested to attenuate phytochrome signaling because it reduces the amount of active Pfr when no light stimuli are present (7Elich T.D. Chory J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 2271-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Importantly, a mutant form of phyB (phyB101) with accelerated dark reversion has greatly reduced signaling abilities (7Elich T.D. Chory J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 2271-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The extent and rate of dark reversion vary widely between species and different phytochromes (8Eichenberg K. Bäurle I. Paulo N. Sharrock R.A. Rüdiger W. Schäfer E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9Kendrick R.E. Hillman W.S. Am. J. Bot. 1971; 58: 424-428Google Scholar). Especially, phyA of monocotyledonous plants appears not to undergo dark reversion at all (10Kunkel T. Speth V. Büche C. Schäfer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20193-20200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Remberg A. Ruddat A. Braslavsky S.E. Gärtner W. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9983-9990Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this case, like for other light labile phytochromes, signal attenuation is achieved by rapid degradation of the activated Pfr form (12Clough R.C. Vierstra R.D. Plant Cell Environ. 1997; 20: 713-721Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Using a yeast expression system for domain swapping experiments, it could be shown that the entire molecule is required to prevent spontaneous dark reversion (13Eichenberg K. Kunkel T. Kretsch T. Speth V. Schäfer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 354-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Previously, it was observed that dark reversion is often incomplete; therefore, Brockmann et al. (14Brockmann J. Rieble S. Kazarinova-Fukshansky N. Seyfried M. Schäfer E. Plant Cell Environ. 1987; 10: 105-111Google Scholar) suggested that Pfr-Pfr homodimers are stable and do not undergo dark reversion. However, the rapid degradation upon irradiation of the major phytochromes in plants greatly complicates further investigations. In this study, we used dimeric phytochrome heterologously expressed in yeast to biochemically study the structural requirements for the stability of active Pfr. Arabidopsis phyA cDNA in pKS (plasmid pbpA7) was kindly provided by P. Quail. For expression in yeast the vectors pAA7 (15Abe A. Wada T. Handa H. Nogi Y. Fukasawa T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1988; 52: 2035-2042Google Scholar) and pAA7b were used. 2L. Hennig; the plasmid will be described elsewhere. These plasmids allow GAL7 promoter-driven protein expression in yeast based on uracil or leucine auxotrophic selection. The cDNA was subcloned into pAA7 using DraI and SalI, yielding plasmid pAAt3. This cloning strategy eliminated an additional ATG followed by a short open reading frame upstream of the start codon, which caused very low expression levels in yeast (data not shown). Plasmid p-malc2 (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) harboring malE, the gene coding for MBP, and pbpA7 were used as templates for polymerase chain reaction to generate an in-frame fusion of the MBP cDNA to the 3′ end of the phyA cDNA in pKS (plasmid pbpA12) and in pAA7b (pAbAt3). A mutated phyA·MBP fusion cDNA encoding the C323S phyA polypeptide was constructed by polymerase chain reaction. The construct was subcloned into pKS (plasmid pbpA13) and pAA7b (pAbAt4). Expression and affinity purification of phyA was carried out as described previously (16Hennig L. Schäfer E. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, strain KN380 (17Morishima N. Nakagawa K. Yamamoto E. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15189-15197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was transformed with appropriate plasmid(s). Cotransformation with pAA7- and pAA7b-derived plasmids allowed coordinated, inducible expression of two polypeptides at similar levels. Single colonies were used to inoculate 100 ml of selective minimal medium (18Kunkel T. Tomizawa K.-I. Kern R. Furuya M. Chua N.H. Schäfer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and grown for 1 day at 30 °C. This culture was diluted with 500 ml of noninducing complete medium (18Kunkel T. Tomizawa K.-I. Kern R. Furuya M. Chua N.H. Schäfer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and grown overnight at 30 °C. At anA 600 of ∼1, protein expression was induced with 2% (w/v) solid galactose. After an additional 5–8 h of cultivation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. This procedure usually yielded 0.9–1.2 g of wet weight cells per 100 ml of culture. Cells were resuspended in 2 volumes of Buffer A (100 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.7), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 28 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain) and disrupted in an SLM Aminco French pressure cell with 120 MPa. The extract was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Affinity purification on amylose resins (New England Biolabs) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after washing with several volumes of Buffer A, bound material was eluted with 10 mm maltose in Buffer A. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and Western blotting using MAC3/289 antiserum directed against mustard phyA (kindly provided by B. Thomas, Wellesbourne, Warwick, UK). In this paper, we refer to Arabidopsis phyA-PCB holoproteins as PHY, toArabidopsis phyA·MBP fusions assembled with PCB as PHY-MBP, and to the C323S mutant protein, which cannot incorporate PCB, as PHY(C323S)-MBP. PCB preparation and assembly were carried out as described in Ref. 16Hennig L. Schäfer E. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar. For spectrophotometric studies, PCB was added to the crude extract from a stock solution in Me2SO to a final concentration of 4 μm and incubated at 0 °C under a green safelight for 1 h prior to further analysis. Difference spectra were recorded using an HP8452A spectrophotometer with the possibility of external irradiation and a temperature-controlled cuvette jacket. Light sources, acquisition of spectra, and data handling were described in Ref. 18Kunkel T. Tomizawa K.-I. Kern R. Furuya M. Chua N.H. Schäfer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar. Briefly, phytochrome was converted into Pr by a far-red light pulse (730 nm, 90 s, 6 W m−2), and a blank scan was obtained. Conversion to Pfr was achieved by a pulse of red light (666 nm, 30 s, 50 W m−2). The difference spectrum was recorded immediately afterward. For dark reversion kinetics of purified phytochrome in solution, the absorbance difference, ΔA, between the maximum of the difference spectrum (704 nm) and the isosbestic point (674 nm) was measured every 30 s after the end of the R pulse using the HP8452A spectrophotometer. Control experiments revealed that the measuring beam did not influence the obtained dark reversion kinetics (data not shown). Alternatively, a custom-built dual wavelength ratiospectrophotometer was used to measure Pfr after incubation of the irradiated cuvettes for various times in a temperature-controlled water bath in the dark. Measurements were carried out at 5 °C using Ca2CO3 as the scattering agent. Concentration of photoreversible phytochrome was calculated from the difference spectra as described (20Li L. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19204-19210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by an Amido Black incorporation method (21Popov N. Schmitt M. Schulzeck S. Matthies H. Acta Biol. Med. Ger. 1975; 34: 1441-1446PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis and presentation of experimental data were performed using SigmaPlot Scientific Graphing System version 4.0 (Jandel Corp., Chicago, IL). Dark reversion kinetics were fitted by nonlinear regression to Equation 1, which was obtained using standard principles of chemical kinetics (22Gutfreund H. Kinetics for the Life Sciences. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1995Crossref Google Scholar). [Pfr](t)=2A exp(−kDR,1t)+B exp(−kDR,2t)+2AkDR,1/Equation 1 (kDR,2−kDR,1)(exp(−kDR,1t)−exp(kDR,2t)) [Pfr] is the amount of Pfr; A and B are the fractions of phytochrome present in homodimers and heterodimers, respectively; andk DR,1 and k DR,2 are dark reversion rate constants of Pfr subunits present in Pfr-Pfr homodimers and Pfr-Pr heterodimers, respectively (see also Fig.4 B). Previously, we showed that tobacco phyB·MBP fusion proteins can be purified efficiently on an amylose column without compromising the spectral properties of the phytochrome (16Hennig L. Schäfer E. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A shows that theArabidopsis phyA·MBP fusion (PHY-MBP) heterologously expressed in yeast also bound, and could be affinity-eluted from, amylose. In contrast, heterologously expressed phytochrome without an MBP moiety did not bind amylose (Fig. 1 B). To analyze the role of the individual subunits on phytochrome properties, we produced heterodimers of wild-type phytochrome polypeptides and phytochrome bearing a C323S mutation that cannot incorporate the chromophore. Consequently, only one subunit of such heterodimers could adopt the active Pfr form. To this end, we coexpressed PHY and PHY(C323S)-MBP in yeast. Fig. 1 C shows that when coexpressed with PHY(C323S)-MBP, PHY could also be eluted from amylose, although in less than stoichiometrical amounts. Obviously, this eluate contains PHY(C323S)-MBP, PHY(C323S)-MBP homodimers, and PHY PHY(C323S)-MBP heterodimers. Because the homodimers without a chromophore are spectroscopically inactive, the eluate can be used to characterize the heterodimers in more detail. Alternatively, we expressed PHY and PHY(C323S)-MBP in separate cultures and mixed the crude extracts. After incubating the mixture with amylose, only PHY(C323S)-MBP (but no PHY) could be eluted (Fig. 1 D). TableI summarizes amylose-based affinity purification of PHY, PHY-MBP, and PHY coexpressed with PHY(C323S)-MBP. Like the immunoblots, the spectroscopic detection of phytochrome in solutions shows that PHY-MBP could be affinity-eluted from amylose. In contrast, PHY was affinity-eluted only when coexpressed with PHY(C323S)-MBP. Yield (5–10%) and purification (about 60-fold) were slightly lower than previous results with tobacco phyB (15% and 120-fold, respectively (16Hennig L. Schäfer E.

Open table in a new tab Protein expression and purification was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Hallmarks of the structural integrity of phytochromes are difference spectra. Fig. 2 shows the essentially identical difference spectra of PHY, PHY-MBP in crude extract, affinity-purified PHY-MBP, and PHY PHY(C323S)-MBP heterodimers. The difference spectra have minima at 660 nm, isosbestic points at 674 nm, and maxima at 704 nm, closely resembling published data (8Eichenberg K. Bäurle I. Paulo N. Sharrock R.A. Rüdiger W. Schäfer E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, PHY(C323S)-MBP did not yield any photoreversible signal. Arabidopsis phyA undergoes considerable dark reversion in living yeast cells (8Eichenberg K. Bäurle I. Paulo N. Sharrock R.A. Rüdiger W. Schäfer E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Likewise, purified PHY-MBP showed dark reversion in solution (Fig.3 A). Subsequently, we used a different detection system with higher sensitivity and a better signal-to-noise ratio, which is based on a custom-built dual wavelength ratiospectrophotometer. Dark reversion kinetics of PHY-MBP at 25 °C were essentially identical using either assay (Fig. 3, A andB), proceeding with a half-life of 50–60 min and leaving about 40% Pfr after 4 h. In contrast, at 5 °C, no dark reversion of PHY-MBP was detectable within 5 h. Fig. 3 Cshows dark reversion kinetics of PHY at 5 and 25 °C, which are very similar to those of PHYA-MBP. Using purified PHY PHY(C323S)-MBP heterodimers, which can form only Pfr-Pr heterodimers upon irradiation, we obtained the results shown in Fig. 3 D. Strikingly, in this case, a monophasic, fast, and complete dark reversion occurred. An alternative means to produce high amounts of Pfr-Pr heterodimers is irradiation with light of longer wavelengths, e.g. around 700 nm. For the blue-shifted PCB-phyA holoprotein, we determinedϕ as 0.11 at 701 nm (data not shown), corresponding to 9.8% Pfr-Pr heterodimers and only 1.2% Pfr-Pfr homodimers. Fig.4 A shows dark reversion kinetics observed after irradiation of PHY with light of 701 nm. As for the PHY PHY(C323S)-MBP heterodimers, a fast and nearly complete dark reversion was observed. We conclude from the results of Figs. 3 and 4 A that Pfr-Pr heterodimers undergo a fast dark reversion, whereas Pfr-Pfr homodimers are stabilized. Therefore, dark reversion kinetics can be described quantitatively with two rate constants, k DR,1and k DR,2 (Fig. 4 B). The experimental results of Figs. 3 and 4, as well as previously published data (8Eichenberg K. Bäurle I. Paulo N. Sharrock R.A. Rüdiger W. Schäfer E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Kunkel T. Speth V. Büche C. Schäfer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20193-20200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), were analyzed by nonlinear regression using Equation 1. TableII contains the determined rate constants. Concerning Arabidopsis phyA, purified PHY-MBP behaves very similar to PHY in yeast extracts. Almost no dark reversion was detectable at 5 °C; at 25 °C Pfr-Pfr homodimers reverted with a half-life of about 6 h, whereas Pfr-Pr heterodimers reverted with a half-life of 30–40 min. Furthermore, both assay systems yielded similar results for purified PHY-MBP. Likewise, the rate constants of dark reversion after irradiation with 701 nm matched the other results closely. Moreover, purified PHY PHY(C323S)-MBP heterodimers were stable at 5 °C but reverted rapidly at 25 °C (t 12 = 40 min). Re-analysis of published data revealed that other phytochromes fromArabidopsis and tobacco also show a much slower dark reversion of Pfr-Pfr homodimers than Pfr-Pr heterodimers (TableII).Table IIRate constants of dark reversion for various phytochromesPhytochromeSampleAssayTemperaturek DR,1k DR,2k DR,1/kDR,2Ref.AtPHYA-MBPPurifiedaDual-wavelength ratiospectrophotometer (irradiation with 660 nm).5 °C>12 h>12 hn.d. bNot determined.This workAtPHYA-MBPPurifiedcHP8452A spectrophotometer (irradiation with 660 nm).25 °C8.2 h44 min11This workAtPHYA-MBPPurifiedaDual-wavelength ratiospectrophotometer (irradiation with 660 nm).25 °C5.7 h30 min11This workHeterodimersPurifiedaDual-wavelength ratiospectrophotometer (irradiation with 660 nm).5 °C>12 hThis workHeterodimersPurifiedaDual-wavelength ratiospectrophotometer (irradiation with 660 nm).25 °C44 minThis workAtPHYAYeast extractaDual-wavelength ratiospectrophotometer (irradiation with 660 nm).5 °C>12 h>12 hn.d.This workAtPHYAYeast extract2-aDual-wavelength ratiospectrophotometer (irradiation with 660 nm).25 °C5.5 h41 min8This workAtPHYAYeast extractdDual-wavelength ratiospectrophotometer (irradiation with 701 nm).25 °C5.4 h33 min10This workAtPHYAYeast cellsaDual-wavelength ratiospectrophotometer (irradiation with 660 nm).4 °C5.7 h19 min188Eichenberg K.

Subsequently, we obtained dark reversion kinetics of PHY at temperatures between 5 and 30 °C (data not shown). Fig.5 shows an Eyring plot using the resulting rate constants k DR,1 andk DR,2. The data reveal a strong temperature dependence of the reactions. Activation enthalphies are 22.2 and 17.8 kcal/mol for Pfr-Pfr homodimers and Pfr-Pr heterodimers, respectively. These values correspond to a 3–4-fold increase of dark reversion rates with a temperature increase of 10 °C. The role of dimerization in the biological functions of phytochromes has been controversial for several years (6Mancinelli A.L. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg H.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluver Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1994: 211-270Crossref Google Scholar, 14Brockmann J. Rieble S. Kazarinova-Fukshansky N. Seyfried M. Schäfer E.

Main arguments in this debate were based on indirect, physiological data of whole plants. Here, we chose a direct, biochemical approach to analyze the influence of dimerization on phytochrome dynamics. We used MBP fusions for affinity purification of Arabidopsis phyA from yeast extracts, a system that was previously described for tobacco phyB (16Hennig L. Schäfer E. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus, both phyA- and phyB-like phytochromes can be purified as MBP fusions. For Arabidopsis phyA, yield and purification were slightly lower than reported for tobacco phyB. However, phyA nonfused to MBP (PHY) does not bind to amylose resins at all (Fig. 1, Table I). The system therefore is well suited for copurification experiments. Indeed, PHY can be detected in amylose resin eluates when coexpressed with PHY-MBP. This observation was confirmed by spectroscopy when photoreversible PHY and nonphotoreversible PHY(C323S)-MBP were coexpressed and copurified. Interestingly, when PHY and PHY-MBP were expressed separately, and the mixed extracts were incubated with amylose, only PHY-MBP could be affinity-eluted. Therefore, the exchange of subunits between phytochrome dimers appears to be very slow. Possibly, dimerization occurs cotranslationally, leading to large fractions of homodimers. Data of our group suggest that instead of the expected 50%, only 10–20% of phyA is present as mixed dimers. 3L. Hennig and E. Schäfer, unpublished results. Nonetheless, this fraction is large enough to allow spectroscopic analysis. The MBP moiety was fused to the C terminus of phyA, whereas the spectral integrity is determined by its N terminus. Therefore, in agreement with other observations (16Hennig L. Schäfer E. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 24Murphy J.T. Lagarias J.C. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 65: 750-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the difference spectrum was not altered by fusion of Arabidopsis phyA to MBP and affinity purification (Fig. 2). More important, PHY PHY(C323S)-MBP heterodimers also had an unaltered difference spectrum. Because interactions of the C terminus with the N terminus differ considerably between Pr and Pfr (25Song P.S. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 32: 215-225Google Scholar), our results indicate that interactions between the subunits are only of minor importance for absorbance maxima ofArabidopsis phyA per se. The role of intra-subunit interactions varies. The difference spectra of monomeric, N-terminal fragments are blue-shifted for pea phyA but are unaltered for oat phyA and potato phyB (11Remberg A. Ruddat A. Braslavsky S.E. Gärtner W. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9983-9990Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Song P.S. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 32: 215-225Google Scholar). Dark reversion in vitro apparently depends strongly on sample integrity and conditions (26Ruddat A. Schmidt P. Gatz C. Braslavsky S.E. Gärtner W. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The two assay systems for dark reversion applied in this study yielded identical results, largely excluding artifacts in the measurements. Moreover, several independent sample preparations yielded similar results (data not shown). Fusion to MBP and affinity purification did not alter the dark reversion of phyA when compared with PHY in crude yeast extracts (Fig. 3). In contrast, analysis of PHY PHY(C323S)-MBP heterodimers revealed a fast, monophasic, and complete dark reversion. Consequently, the retarded dark reversion of a large fraction of PHY is due to its ability to form Pfr-Pfr homodimers. Apparently, additional inter-subunit contacts are formed in such homodimers, leading to a much higher thermal stability. After irrradiation with 701 nm, which forms mainly Pfr-Pr homodimers, PHY also underwent a fast and nearly complete dark reversion, confirming our conclusions. Analysis of reaction kinetics of dimeric phytochromes (this work and re-evaluation of data from previous reports (8Eichenberg K. Bäurle I. Paulo N. Sharrock R.A. Rüdiger W. Schäfer E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Kunkel T. Speth V. Büche C. Schäfer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20193-20200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)) demonstrated that in cases in which dark reversion occurred, Pfr-Pr heterodimers of all phytochromes reverted much faster than Pfr-Pfr homodimers (Table II). Interestingly, Arabidopsis phyA rapidly reverted from Pfr to Pr when assayed in living cells at 4 °C (8Eichenberg K. Bäurle I. Paulo N. Sharrock R.A. Rüdiger W. Schäfer E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, no detectable dark reversion of extracted or purifiedArabidopsis phyA occurred during 12 h at this temperature. We got identical results as reported previously (8Eichenberg K. Bäurle I. Paulo N. Sharrock R.A. Rüdiger W. Schäfer E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) when assaying both PHY and a PHY-S-Tag (Novagen, Madison, WI) fusion in living yeast cells (data not shown). Consequently, dark reversion ofArabidopsis phytochrome is facilitated in yeast cells. Because this acceleration was not observed in crude extracts, the yeast factor responsible must depend on intact cellular metabolism and/or is extremely protease-sensitive. The former alternative is favored by our observation that phytochrome was occasionally completely stable for several hours even in living yeast cells (data not shown). Dark reversion of phytochrome is controlled by intramolecular properties; additionally, it appears to be modulated by external factors in plants (11Remberg A. Ruddat A. Braslavsky S.E. Gärtner W. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9983-9990Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Eichenberg K. Kunkel T. Kretsch T. Speth V. Schäfer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 354-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that some of these factors are also present in yeast and are not exclusively specific to plants. It would be interesting to test whether chaperone-like activities are involved in the acceleration of conformational changes connected to dark reversion. Dark reversion rates of Pfr-Pfr homodimers are about one order of magnitude lower than those of Pfr-Pr heterodimers (Table II). WhereasArabidopsis and tobacco phyB Pfr-Pr heterodimers revert extremely rapidly (t 12 = 1–4 min at 4 °C), Pfr-Pr heterodimers of phyA revert much slower (t 12= 20 min). Heterodimers of rice phyA are even more stable. In contrast, Pfr-Pfr homodimers revert with half-lives of at least several hours for all analyzed phytochrome molecules. To evaluate relative stabilities of hetero- and homodimers, we calculated the ratio ofk DR,1 to k DR,2 (TableII). This ratio is 100–300 for B-type phytochromes, 10–20 for phyA, and has intermediate values for phyC and phyE. Therefore, Pfr-Pr heterodimers are relatively short-lived in the evolutionarily ancient phyB, whereas they are considerably stabilized in the more recently evolved phyA (27Mathews S. Sharrock R.A. Plant Cell Environ. 1997; 20: 666-671Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Because rice phyA, which displays barely any dark reversion, is further stabilized compared with ArabidopsisphyA, the stability of Pfr-Pr heterodimers has been enhanced selectively during evolution. Intriguingly, physiological studies indicated that the biological activity of Pfr-Pr heterodimers is closely connected to phyA. In contrast, phyB seems to be active only as a Pfr-Pfr homodimer (23Furuya M. Schäfer E. Trends Plant. Sci. 1996; 1: 301-307Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). This would lead to a strict requirement of dimerization for phyB function to stabilize the active Pfr form. The generation of Pfr-Pr heterodimers in vitro comprises an effective tool to test this hypothesis. By measuring dark reversion at various temperatures, we determined the activation enthalpies of this reaction as 22 and 18 kcal/mol for Pfr-Pfr homodimers and Pfr-Pr heterodimers, respectively (Fig. 5). Therefore, additional subunit interactions in Pfr-Pfr homodimers confer a stabilization of about 4 kcal/mol. Both activation enthalpies are relatively high values, corresponding to a 3–4-fold increase of dark reversion rates with a temperature increase of 10 °C. Obviously, such a strong temperature dependence imposes a serious problem on plants, which, being sessile organisms, are often subjected to large temperature variations imposed by the environment. It is of major importance for plants to respond adequately to the light environment under all conditions. Therefore, we assume that dark reversion is regulated in vivo, largely buffering temperature variations. Several reports confirmed that activation enthalpies are a widespread target of evolution (22Gutfreund H. Kinetics for the Life Sciences. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1995Crossref Google Scholar); the reaction of metarhodopsin-I to metarhodopsin-II, for instance, has a very large temperature dependence in bovine rhodopsin but only a moderate one in frog retina (28Liebman P.A. Jagger W.S. Kaplan M.W. Bargoot F.G. Nature. 1974; 251: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to test whether some of the identified interaction partners, which preferentially bind Pfr, can also stabilize this active form of phytochrome. Importantly, indications of control of dark reversion by plant factors were found (11Remberg A. Ruddat A. Braslavsky S.E. Gärtner W. Schaffner K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9983-9990Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 4K. Eichenberg and E. Schäfer, unpublished results. In summary, subunit interactions are largely dispensable for correct absorption maxima of phytochromes. However, to assure a long-lasting presence of active Pfr required for efficient generation of biological signals, inter-subunit contacts can extend the half-life of Pfr up to 300 times. In addition, signals have to be attenuated; thus, the ability to control dark reversion by intramolecular and extramolecular mechanisms evolved differentially for individual phytochromes depending on their biological functions.

Here, we investigated the presence of sorting signal(s) in proneurotensin/neuromedin N.

Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar, 2Gumbiner B. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1982; 28: 51-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 3Kelly R.B. Science. 1985; 230: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in neuroendocrine cells, neuropeptides and peptide hormones are generally synthesized as part of large precursors in which they are flanked by processing sites, usually pairs of basic residues. The precursors must be cleaved at processing sites by PCs (for review, see Ref. 4Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) to yield the biologically active peptides that will be secreted under stimulation. Sorting between the constitutive and the regulated secretory pathway is thought to occur in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and/or in immature secretory granules (IG) that originate from the TGN (for review, see Ref. 5Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), ultimately leading to the packaging and storage of regulated proteins and peptides into mature secretory granules. Despite considerable advancement in our understanding of the regulated secretion machinery in specialized cells, the sorting mechanisms into the RSP remain unclear. Moore and Kelly (6Moore H.H. Kelly R.B. Nature. 1986; 321: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a constitutive protein can be re-routed to the RSP when fused with a regulated protein. This result led to the idea that the targeting of proteins into the RSP is an active process, whereas constitutive secretion occurs by default. Furthermore, it was recognized early that aggregation of secreted proteins occurs in a late Golgi compartment (1Palade G. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar), and this led Kelly to suggest that specific aggregation of regulated proteins could direct their sorting to the RSP (3Kelly R.B. Science. 1985; 230: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). At least two nonexclusive mechanisms have been proposed to account for the sorting of proteins or protein aggregates to the RSP. The first mechanism, designated sorting-for-entry (5Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), postulates that upon reaching the TGN, regulated proteins or aggregates are actively directed to IGs by a process that would involve their specific binding to components of the TGN membrane. Thus, because of the homologies between exocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis, Orci (7Orci L. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 538-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) suggested the existence of TGN receptor(s) that would bind regulated proteins and lead to their RSP sorting. The second mechanism, termed sorting-by-retention (5Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), hypothesizes that both regulated and constitutive proteins can enter IGs and that regulated proteins are retained in the maturing granule while constitutive proteins are eliminated (8Arvan P.

The first one, recently reviewed (5Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), proposes that constitutive proteins exit IGs via an active mechanism that leads to their entry in constitutive-like vesicles budding from IG membrane. In this model, regulated rather than constitutive secretion would be the default pathway. It is not excluded, however, that retention of regulated proteins in the granules may be facilitated by their ability to aggregate or associate with other proteins in the maturing secretory granules (5Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The second hypothesis, also recently reviewed and discussed (12Glombik M.M. Gerdes H.H. Biochimie. 2000; 82: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), considers that retention of regulated proteins in the IGs is achieved through basically the same mechanism as that proposed to operate in the sorting-for-entry model, i.e. aggregation and/or binding to a sorting receptor in the granule membrane. In this case, constitutive proteins could be passively excluded from the granules (12Glombik M.M. Gerdes H.H. Biochimie. 2000; 82: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Whatever the sorting 2Throughout this paper, the term “sorting” is used in a broad sense and is intended to mean that, at some point in the cell, regulated proteins are separated from constitutive proteins and ultimately stored in mature secretory granules. No assumption, unless explicitly indicated, is made as to the mechanisms underlying the different fate of regulated and constitutive proteins. In this line, a “sorting signal” could be simply defined as any sequence, motif or conformational element whose deletion from a regulated protein leads the protein to the constitutive pathway and, conversely, whose fusion to a constitutive protein leads the fusion protein to the regulated pathway, whatever the underlying sorting mechanism. 2Throughout this paper, the term “sorting” is used in a broad sense and is intended to mean that, at some point in the cell, regulated proteins are separated from constitutive proteins and ultimately stored in mature secretory granules.

In this line, a “sorting signal” could be simply defined as any sequence, motif or conformational element whose deletion from a regulated protein leads the protein to the constitutive pathway and, conversely, whose fusion to a constitutive protein leads the fusion protein to the regulated pathway, whatever the underlying sorting mechanism.mechanism, interactions of regulated proteins with other proteins or membrane components in the TGN or in the IGs are thought to play a crucial role in sorting between the constitutive and the regulated pathways. This has led to the search for sequences or structural elements (sorting signal) in regulated proteins that would direct or facilitate their storage in mature secretory granules. However, the nature of these elements is still a matter of debate (recently reviewed in Ref. 12Glombik M.M. Gerdes H.H. Biochimie. 2000; 82: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). No consensus amino acid sequence was revealed by sequence alignments of hormone precursors (13Halban P.A. Irminger J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Comparison between hydropathic profiles of regulated proteins suggested that a N-terminal hydrophobic domain might represent a possible sorting signal for some regulated proteins (14Gorr S.U. Darling D.S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, experimental evidence to support this hypothesis are lacking. In vitro studies demonstrated the ability of granins to aggregate in the TGN (15Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Further studies indicated that a disulfide bond-stabilized loop in the N-terminal region of chromogranin B (CgB) was necessary for its secretion through the RSP (16Chanat E. Weiss U. Huttner W.B. Tooze S.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2159-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17Kromer A. Glombik M.M. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1331-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Glombik M.M. Kromer A. Salm T. Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1059-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A disulfide bond-delimited sequence in the N-terminal region of POMC was also found to be essential for addressing this precursor to the RSP (19Cool D.R. Fenger M. Snell C.R. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8723-8729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this case, the disulfide-bonded sequence was shown to bind to carboxypeptidase E (CPE), an enzyme involved in late steps of precursor processing, and it was proposed that CPE might be a sorting receptor in the TGN for several hormone precursors (20Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). This view, however, is in contradiction with earlier studies showing that the N-terminal domain of POMC was not required for its sorting to the RSP but, rather, that cooperation between different internal POMC domains might be involved (21Roy P. Chevrier D. Fournier H. Racine C. Zollinger M. Crine P. Boileau G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 82: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the proposal of CPE as a sorting receptor for hormone precursors was recently challenged (22Irminger J.C. Verchere C.B. Meyer K. Halban P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27532-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,23Thiele C. Gerdes H.H. Huttner W.B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R496-R500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Attention was also paid to the dibasic sequences that are usually numerous in prohormone precursors as possible sorting signals. Thus, although initial studies suggested that the N-terminal domain of prosomatostatin may play a role in precursor targeting to the RSP (24Sevarino K.A. Stork P. Ventimiglia R. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Cell. 1989; 57: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), further work indicated that the somatostatin 28-containing C-terminal region might also be involved in sorting (25Sevarino K.A. Stork P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18507-18513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that a single mutation of the Arg-Lys dibasic that is normally processed to yield somatostatin 14 prevented prosomatostatin from entering the RSP (26Brakch N. Cohen P. Boileau G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Similarly, following initial studies suggesting that in prorenin no signal was present in the prodomain that may be involved in its routing to the RSP (27Nakayama K. Nagahama M. Kim W.S. Hatsuzawa K. Hashiba K. Murakami K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Reudelhuber T.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1905-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Chidgey M.A. Harrison T.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 30Nagahama M. Nakayama K. Murakami K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), a more recent work showed that mutation of the dibasic that is normally processed in prorenin to produce renin prevented sorting of the protein to the RSP (31Brechler V. Chu W.N. Baxter J.D. Thibault G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20636-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to look for structural elements that could be responsible for the routing of proneurotensin/neuromedin N (pro-NT/NN) into the RSP. This molecule is the common precursor of two bioactive neuropeptides, neurotensin (NT) and neuromedin-N (NN) (32Dobner P.R. Barber D.L. Villa-Komaroff L. McKiernan C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Pro-NT/NN is mainly expressed in the gut, brain, and adrenals. The organization of the precursor is depicted in Fig. 1. NT and NN are located near the C terminus of the precursor, where they are flanked and separated by three dibasic sequences. A fourth dibasic site preceding an NN-like sequence is present in the N-terminal region of pro-NT/NN and a fifth dibasic site is found within the NT sequence. Processing studies demonstrated that PC1, PC2, and PC5-A differentially process pro-NT/NN at the three dibasic sites that flank and separate NT and NN with patterns that reproduce those observed in the gut, the brain, and the adrenals, respectively (33Rovere C. Barbero P. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11368-11375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34Barbero P. Rovere C. De Bie I. Seidah N. Beaudet A. Kitabgi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25339-25346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In contrast, the dibasic site upstream of the NN-like sequence and the one within NT are not normally cleaved by any of these PCs. As indicated above, disulfide bond-delimited domains were reported to be essential for the sorting of both chromogranin B and POMC. As two cysteine residues are present in the N-terminal region of pro-NT/NN, we first demonstrated the existence of an intramolecular disulfide bridge in the precursor and investigated its function by mutating the cysteine residues or deleting the sequence in between (Fig. 2). Then, the role of the long N-terminal region upstream of NN and of the short C-terminal tail downstream of NT was studied with deletion. Finally, deletions and mutations were also made in the region that contains the dibasic sites and the active peptide sequences. All the constructs were transiently transfected in beta TC7 cells, an insulinoma cell line able to process endogenous insulin and to sort it to the RSP (35Efrat S. Leiser M. Surana M. Tal M. Fusco-Demane D. Fleischer N. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We then studied the intracellular processing pattern of wild type and mutated pro-NT/NN and determined the secretion pathway of the maturation products. Our results demonstrate that neither the disulfide bridge nor the N- and C-terminal flanking domains are necessary for the correct routing of the precursor to the RSP. In contrast, the neuropeptide-encoding region of pro-NT/NN was shown to contain structural elements that are critical for sorting to the RSP and those elements were identified as the dibasic sequences within this region. That the C-terminal domain of pro-NT/NN contains sorting motifs was further demonstrated by fusing this domain to the C terminus of β-lactamase, a bacterial protein that is constitutively secreted when expressed in eukaryotic cells (36Harrison T.M. Chidgey M.A. Uff S. Cell Biol. Int. 1996; 20: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and showing that the fusion protein was redirected to the RSP in beta TC7 cells. Pro-NT/NN contains two cysteine residues in positions 39 and 88. To see if they form a disulfide bond, large E6I, 3Precursor peptide fragments are designated as K6L, E6I, and H10P, in which the first letter corresponds to the single-letter code of the first amino acid, the middle number corresponds to the number of amino acids residues in the peptide, and the final letter corresponds to the single-letter code of the last amino acid. the 1–117 pro-NT/NN fragment (Fig. 1), was partially purified from rMTC 6–23 cells as reported previously (37Bidard J.N. de Nadai F. Rovere C. Moinier D. Laur J. Martinez J. Cuber J.C. Kitabgi P. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and 70 pmol of this material were submitted to Arg-directed cleavage using the citraconylation, trypsin digestion, and unblocking methods (CT procedure) described previously (37Bidard J.N. de Nadai F. Rovere C. Moinier D. Laur J. Martinez J. Cuber J.C. Kitabgi P. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The CT-treated material was divided in two portions, one of which was reduced with 3% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. This generates several peptides, among them the 9–56 and the 65–89 pro-NT/NN fragments, each of which contains one of the Cys residues. If a disulfide bond links the Cys, both fragments should migrate as a single entity on reverse phase HPLC prior to reduction, whereas they should elute as two peaks after reduction. Unreduced or reduced CT-treated large E6I (30 pmol) was injected onto a 4.6 × 250-mm reverse phase C-18 column (5 μm, 100 Å). Elution was carried out in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.05% triethylamine. The column was equilibrated in 10% acetonitrile, and 10 min after sample injection three linear gradients were run sequentially from 10% to 40%, 40% to 50%, and 50% to 90% acetonitrile in 42, 30, and 10 min, respectively, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. One-ml fractions were collected and assayed for the presence of the 9–56 and 65–89 pro-NT/NN fragments. The 65–89 pro-NT/NN fragment was assayed directly in each HPLC fraction using a previously described K6L radioimmunoassay (RIA) (37Bidard J.N. de Nadai F. Rovere C. Moinier D. Laur J. Martinez J. Cuber J.C. Kitabgi P. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) specific for the free N terminus of the KLPLVL (K6L) peptide that corresponds to sequence 65–70 of pro-NT/NN. To detect the 9–56 pro-NT/NN fragment, a RIA directed against the 19–28 sequence of pro-NT/NN (HASKVSKGSP, H10P) was developed. For this purpose, a peptide corresponding to H10P with a C-terminal Cys (H11C) was synthesized by Dr. Solange Lavielle (Université Paris VII) and C-terminally coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanine according to previously published procedures (38de Nadai F. Rovere C. Bidard J.N. Cuber J.C. Beaudet A. Kitabgi P. Neuroscience. 1994; 60: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Immunization of rabbits with the conjugate led to the production of an antiserum that was used at a 1:65,000 dilution in a RIA that employed125I-H11C as the tracer and unlabeled H11C as the standard. H11C was iodinated on the His1 residue using the lactoperoxidase method and the labeled peptide was purified on reverse phase HPLC. The EC20, EC50, and EC80 of the assay were (in fmol/tube) 24, 122, and 625, respectively. The RIA was specific for H11C, i.e. it did not cross-react with a number of synthetic pro-NT/NN fragments unrelated to H10P. In addition, large E6I was not recognized in the RIA, indicating that the H10P motif had to be exposed to react with the antiserum. The H10P sequence in pro-NT/NN (and large E6I) is preceded by a Met residue and can therefore be freed by CNBr cleavage. Portions of the HPLC fractions (see above) were lyophilized and dissolved in 200 μl of 70% (v/v) formic acid to which were added 50 μl of 2% (w/v) cyanogen bromide in 70% formic acid under argon, and the mixtures were kept for 6 h in darkness. After addition of 1 ml of water and lyophilization, the samples were reconstituted in H10P RIA buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.6) containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and assayed for immunoreactive H10P. Wild-type (WT) prepro-NT/NN cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. P. R. Dobner (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). Deletions within the N-terminal domain of pro-NT/NN (Δ39–88, Δ14–88, Δ14–117, Δ71–117) (Fig. 2) were performed using the Ex-site method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Point mutations, apart from C39S and C88S performed with the USE mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), were done with the Quickchange kit from Stratagene (C39S/C88S, K118Q, R127Q, R136Q, and combination of dibasic mutations) (Fig.2). This kit was also used to obtain the C-terminal truncations (Δ118–147, Δ126–147, Δ141–147) by turning a codon into a stop codon. All kits were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. PCR products were transfected into BMH bacteria (USE) or into XL1 bacteria (Quickchange). Bacteria were grown in LB + ampicillin (50 μg/ml). Plasmids were purified using the Wizard protocol (Promega, Madison, WI), and pro-NT/NN mutants were subcloned into the EcoRl restriction site of the eukaryotic expression pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Leeks, The Netherlands). The correct insertion of pro-NT/NN DNA fragment was checked by restriction mapping with XbaI. Plasmids were used to transform TOP 10F bacteria. The mutations were checked by sequencing the pro-NT/NN cDNAs using a dideoxy method (Prism Dye Deoxy terminator kit; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and primers, either outside the pro-NT/NN sequence (T7, Sp6 primers) or inside. β-Lactamase sequence (ampicillinase) was obtained by PCR amplification of the ampicillin resistance gene (TEM-1) from pcDNA3. We used a 36-mer oligonucleotide (oligo 1), the first 24 5′ nucleotides identical with the 3′ end sequence of β-lactamase, and the other 12 identical with the sequence encoding for the 109–112 domain of pro-NT/NN. Another 36-mer oligonucleotide was used (oligo 2), the first 24 5′ nucleotides of which are reverse complementary to the sequence encoding for the 109–116 domain of pro-NT/NN and the other 12 reverse complementary to the 3′ end of the β-lactamase nucleotide sequence. The β-lactamase sequence was PCR-amplified with oligo 1 and an oligonucleotide identical with the 5′ end of the β-lactamase sequence (apart from a punctual mutation giving rise to aHindIII restriction site). The 109–147 sequence of pro-NT/NN was amplified with Sp6 oligo (3′ end of the polylinker) and oligo 2 from the WT pro-NT/NN-encoding plasmid. The 109–125-encoding sequence was obtained with the same oligos on the previously obtained Δ126–147-encoding plasmid as matrix. The β-lactamase fragment and the C-term pro-NT/NN segment were purified, mixed at a 1:1 molecular ratio, and a PCR amplification (with the Sp6 oligo and the oligonucleotide specific for the 5′ of the β-lactamase sequence) allowed the obtention of the β-lactamase/pro-NT/NN sequence. This product was purified and subcloned inHindIII/NotI-digested pcDNA3. Beta TC7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Biomedia). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Culture media were changed every other day, and cells were passed once a week. The day before transfection, cells were plated in 35-mm dishes (1 × 106 cells/dish). Beta TC7 cells were transfected with polyethyleneimine (800 kDa; Fluka) with few modifications to the protocol described (39Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5526) Google Scholar). For each plate, DNA (2 μg) was diluted in 100 μl of OptiMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 100 μl of OptiMEM containing 15 μl of polyethyleneimine (0.9 mg/ml). Mix was then complemented with 800 μl of OptiMEM and added to the cells. After 5 h, 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% serum was added. 18–20 h later, the supernatant was replaced with 2 ml of fresh complete culture medium. Transiently transfected cells were analyzed 48 h after transfection. To obtain stably transfected cell lines, beta TC7 were passed into 150-mm dishes with the addition of 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the medium, 2 days after transfection. Medium was changed every other day. After 2–3 weeks, clones were picked and expanded in medium complemented with 0.25 mg/ml G418. Expression of the constructs was checked by RIA and Western blot assays. Mock-transfected clones (transfection with pcDNA3 alone) give no signal whatever the technique. All clones were maintained in selection medium throughout, until the begining of the experiments. For regulated secretion studies, the cells were incubated first with 500 μl of OptiMEM (30-min basal), then with 500 μl of OptiMEM containing 46 mm KCl and 4.4 mm CaCl2 (30-min stimulation) and the incubation media were kept frozen until further use. Finally, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS from Eurobio) and extracted in 500 μl of cold 0.1 n HCl. The extracts were incubated for 10 min at 95 °C, centrifuged, and the supernatants were kept frozen. Protein amounts were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent under the manufacturer's conditions. HPLC and RIA procedures have been described previously (37Bidard J.N. de Nadai F. Rovere C. Moinier D. Laur J. Martinez J. Cuber J.C. Kitabgi P. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 40Rovere C. De Nadai F. Bidard J.N. Cuber J.C. Kitabgi P. Peptides. 1993; 14: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, the NT 29G and NT 28H antisera (kind gifts of Jean-Claude Cuber, INSERM U 45, Lyon) react with the C terminus and N terminus of NT, respectively, the NN antiserum with the N terminus of NN, and the K6L antiserum with the N terminus of the K6L sequence (see above). These antisera recognize their respective antigen only when the adjacent dibasic sequence in the precursor has been cleaved. Both the NN and K6L sequence start with a Lys residue which itself is preceded by a Lys-Arg doublet in pro-NT/NN. To detect cryptic NN and K6L sequences in large pro-NT/NN fragments, Arg-directed trypsin cleavage was performed following protection of Lys residues by citraconylation (hence the abbreviation CT for citraconylation-trypsin digestion). The CT procedure was applied to media and cell extracts, and the CT-treated samples were assayed for their immunoreactive NN and K6L contents. The intracellular CT immunoreactive NN (CTiNN) contents thus measured represent the total amount of precursor (processed + unprocessed) stored in the cells at the time of cell extraction. As NN immunoreactivity corresponds to processed precursor, we determine the amount of unprocessed large forms by subtracting iNN (processed) from CTiNN (processed + unprocessed). Bet"

Classic cadherins are characterized by a highly conserved intracellular domain that interacts with the actin-containing cytoskeleton, an interaction essential for function. This interaction is mediated by α- and β-catenin (1Aberle H. Schwartz H. Kemler R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 2Gumbiner B.M. McCrea P. J.

Biol. 1997; 35: 161-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of the interaction of β-catenin with N-cadherin is mediated by the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on β-catenin (13Balsamo J. Leung T.-C. Ernst H. Zanin M.K.B. Hoffman S. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 14Balsamo J. Arregui C. Leung T.-C. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In embryonic chick neural retina cells, hyperphosphorylation of β-catenin is correlated with loss of its association with N-cadherin and loss of cadherin function (13Balsamo J. Leung T.-C. Ernst H. Zanin M.K.B. Hoffman S. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 14Balsamo J. Arregui C. Leung T.-C. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Enhanced phosphorylation of β-catenin has also been correlated with loss of E-cadherin function (15Matsuyoshi N.

These data suggest that tyrosine kinases and/or phosphatases must play a critical role in maintaining β-catenin association with cadherin and/or its ability to mediate the cytoskeletal linkage. We have reported that the nonreceptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B binds to the cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin and regulates its function by dephosphorylating β-catenin (13Balsamo J. Leung T.-C. Ernst H. Zanin M.K.B. Hoffman S. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 14Balsamo J. Arregui C. Leung T.-C. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transfection of mouse L-cells constitutively expressing N-cadherin with a catalytically inactive PTP1B (substitution of cysteine 215 for serine) abolishes the ability of these cells to form N-cadherin-mediated adhesions. The mutant PTP1B associates with N-cadherin displacing endogenous PTP1B, resulting in dissociation of the cadherin-actin connection and accumulation of cadherin-free tyrosine-phosphorylated β-catenin (14Balsamo J. Arregui C. Leung T.-C. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). PTP1B is targeted to many distinct cellular locations based on specific residues or domains in the molecule. The largest single pool is localized to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum through a carboxyl-terminal domain (20Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). PTP1B also interacts with the insulin receptor and the EGF receptor and is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to receptor stimulation (21Seely, B. L., Staubs, P. A., Reichart, D. R., Berhanu, P., Milarski, K. L., Saltiel, A. R., Kusari, J., and Olefsky, J. M. (1996) 45, 1379–1385.Google Scholar, 22Bandyopadhyay D. Kusari A. Kenner K.A. Liu F. Chernoff J. Gustafson T.A.

J. 1997; 327: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We have also reported that PTP1B is physically and functionally associated with focal adhesion complexes (24Arregui C. Balsamo J. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This association may depend on binding to p130cas through a proline-rich site (25Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Binding of PTP1B to N-cadherin requires that PTP1B itself be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (13Balsamo J. Leung T.-C. Ernst H. Zanin M.K.B. Hoffman S. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 14Balsamo J. Arregui C. Leung T.-C. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In this study we show that the in vitro and in situ interaction between PTP1B and N-cadherin depends on phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 152. Monoclonal mouse anti-PTP1B antibody was purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-N-cadherin antibodies were NCD-2, a rat monoclonal specific to chick N-cadherin (grown in our laboratory from a culture provided by M. Takeichi, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan), and polyclonal anti-pan-cadherin (Sigma). Monoclonal rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-HA antibody was from Babco, Richmond, CA). HRP1-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rat secondary antibodies were from Organon Teknika Co. (Durham, NC). Goat-HRP anti-rabbit antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgG were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Antibodies conjugated to magnetic beads, used in immunoprecipitations, were from PerSeptive Biosystems (Farmingham, MA). All mutant forms of PTP1B were generated using recombinant PCR. For bacterial expression in pGEX-KG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), we added a SmaI and anXhoI restriction site at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The oligonucleotide primers were as follows: forward primer, 5′-TCCCCCGGGGGACATGGAGATCGAGAAGGAGTTCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGCCATCAATGAAAACATACCCTG-3′. Theunderlined bases indicate the start and stop codon. For expression in eukaryotic cells, the forward primer included aKpnI restriction site and an HA tag at the 5′ end, and the reverse primer contained an XhoI restriction site at the 3′ end to facilitate cloning into the pcDNA3.1(+)zeo mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The oligonucleotide primers used were as follows: 5′ primer with a KpnI restriction site, 5′-GGGGTACCGCCACCATGGCATACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTGAGATCGAGAAGGAGTTCCA-3′; 3′ primer with an XhoI restriction site, 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGCCATCAATGAAAACATACCCTG-3′. Theunderlined bases indicate the start and stop codon. The oligonucleotide primers designed to introduce the C215S point mutation were as follows (the underlined bases indicate the changes from the naturally occurring nucleotides): forward C215S, 5′-GAGTATGGACCTGTTGTGGTGCACTCCAGTGCAGGAATTGGAAGATCAGG-3′; reverse C215S, 5′-CCTGATCTTCCAATTCCTGCACTGGAGTGCACCACAACAGGTCCATACTC-3′. In addition, three tyrosine residues (Tyr-66, Tyr-152, and Tyr-153) were replaced with phenylalanine in different combinations. The oligonucleotide primers used were as follows: forward Y66F, 5′-GGTGACAATGACTTTATCAATGC-3′; reverse Y66F, 5′-GCATTGATAAAGTCATTGTCACC-3′; forward Y152F, 5′-GATATAAAATCATTTTACACAGTACG-3′; reverse Y152F, 5′-CGTACTGTGTAAAATGATTTTATATC-3′; forward Y153F, 5′-GATATAAAATCATATTTCACAGTACG-3′; reverse Y153F, 5′-CGTACTGTGAAATATGATTTTATATC-3′; forward Y152F/Y153F, 5′-GATATAAAATCATTTTTTCACAGTACG-3′; reverse Y152F/Y153F, 5′-CGTACTGTGAAA AATGATTTTATATC-3′. To achieve high fidelity PCR products, Elongase (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) was used for recombinant PCR. All PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T TA cloning vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. PTP1B cDNA constructs were subcloned in pGEX-KG as SmaI/XhoI fragments. The resulting plasmids were transformed into Epicurian coli TKB1 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that constitutively express a tyrosine kinase. Cultures were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and allowed to express GST-PTP1B fusion proteins for 3 h. Induced cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × gfor 10 min, and the bacterial pellets were stored at −70 °C until ready for use. The frozen bacterial pellets were resuspended in B-PER bacterial protein extraction reagent (Pierce) containing 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma). The suspended cultures were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. Soluble proteins were separated from insoluble residue by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 15 min and stored at −70 °C for future use. Expression of GST-PTP1B was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The cDNA fragment corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin (cyt-N-cad) was generated by PCR and subcloned as aSmaI/XbaI fragment into pGEX-KG. The oligonucleotide primers used were as follows (the underlinedbases are nucleotides corresponding to the 5′ or 3′ end of the cytoplasmic sequence of N-cadherin cDNA): forward, 5′-TCCCCCGGGGGACTTCGTAGTATGGATGAAGCG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCTCTAGAGCGTCAGTCACTCAGTCATCACCTCCACC-3′. The GST fusion protein of cyt-N-cad was prepared as described above and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified GST fusion protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Purified GST-cyt-N-cad was biotinylated using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce), and biotinylation was confirmed by immunoblot using streptavidin-HRP. Biotinylated cyt-N-cad (30 μg/well in PBS) was applied to a streptavidin-coated 96-well plate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with PBS, blocked with 2% BSA (Sigma) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and washed again with PBS. Aliquots of GST-PTP1B mutants (50 μg/well in PBS) were added to the wells, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After several washes in PBS, anti-PTP1B antibody (in 0.5% BSA, PBS) was added to the wells, followed by a 1-h incubation at room temperature and three washes with TBST (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20). Polyclonal anti-mouse HRP antibody (in 0.5% BSA, TBST) was then added, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with TBST. O-Phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) was used as substrate, and absorbance was measured at 492 nm. Mouse fibroblast cells constitutively expressing N-cadherin (LN-cells) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 100 μg/ml Geneticin (G418; Life Technologies, Inc.). 24 h prior to transfection, cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at 1 × 105 cells per well and allowed to reach 80% confluence. Cells were transfected in OptiMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's directions. Stable colonies were selected with 1 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). 6 to 12 stable colonies were selected for each transfection and used within 2 weeks. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 30 min on ice with lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) in PBS). Cells were harvested by scraping, and the cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Aliquots containing equivalent amounts of protein were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μl of rabbit anti-HA tag antibody (1 mg/ml). 10 μl of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to magnetic beads were then added to the supernatant, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with mixing. The magnetic beads were collected using a magnetic stand, washed one time with lysis buffer and three times with PBS, dissolved in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were immunoblotted with anti-PTP1B, anti-HA, and anti-N-cadherin antibodies as described (14Balsamo J. Arregui C. Leung T.-C. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To analyze the precipitation of endogenous PTP1B with N-cadherin, anti-N-cadherin antibody NCD-2 was covalently linked to protein G-agarose beads (Pierce) and incubated with neutral detergent extracts of cells prepared as described above. Bound protein was eluted, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibodies and developed as described. 96-well plates coated with protein L (Pierce) were incubated with anti-N-cadherin antibody NCD-2 (20 μg/ml in PBS; 50 μl/well) overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed three times with PBS and blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Cells in semiconfluent monolayers were washed in serum-free medium and incubated overnight in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 μCi/ml3H-methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cells were then washed twice in HBSGKCa (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2), released from the plate with a 0.002% trypsin solution prepared in the same buffer, washed, and resuspended in the same buffer containing 0.1% BSA, 10 μg/ml DNase, and 0.4 mm AESBF (Calbiochem). Approximately 4 × 104 cells were added to each well. The plate was incubated for 45 min at 37 °C and washed 4 times with HBSGKCa. The cells remaining on the wells were solubilized in 0.5% SDS, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation. The amino acid sequence of chick PTP1B has eleven tyrosine residues; however, only three of those fit the consensus substrate site for most protein-tyrosine kinases (26Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). To determine the residues essential for interaction between N-cadherin and PTP1B we used the catalytically inactive C215S PTP1B mutant to create point mutations substituting phenylalanine for tyrosine residues 66, 152, and 153. This substitution is the most conservative, maintaining the structure and size of the amino acid, but eliminating the phosphorylation site. A diagram of all the constructs is shown in Fig.1. The mutated PTP1B cDNAs were subcloned into pGEX-KG and expressed as GST fusion proteins in the bacterial strain TKB, which expresses a tyrosine kinase with broad specificity, able to phosphorylate a variety of proteins. The GST fusion proteins were analyzed for reactivity with anti-PTP1B and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig.2 A). All PTP1B fusion proteins migrate as multiple bands on SDS-PAGE, with apparent molecular masses between ∼60 and 76 kDa (Fig. 2 A), reflecting the added masses of GST (∼26 kDa) and PTP1B (∼50 kDa). The multiple bands do not appear to reflect differential phosphorylation, as immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody reveals only two major bands. The triple mutant, Y66F/Y152F/Y153F, does not show any reactivity with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, demonstrating that these tyrosine residues are indeed the only substrate sites for Src-like tyrosine kinases. The wild-type enzyme also shows minimal tyrosine phosphorylation as compared with the C215S mutants because of its phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity.Figure 2Immunoblots of PTP1B and N-cadherin fusion proteins. A, Western transfers of SDS-PAGE of wild-type PTP1B (WT), catalytically inactive PTP1B (CS), and catalytically inactive PTP1B containing single, double (indicated by residue numbers), and triple (Tp) mutations at tyrosine residues were blotted with anti-PTP1B (top) and anti-phosphotyrosine (bottom). GST indicates fusion produced from vector lacking an insert.

The labeled cyt-N-cad was further purified to eliminate free biotin and bound to neutravidin-coated 96-well plates. The amount of bound biotin-cyt-N-cad was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an antibody to the carboxyl terminus of N-cadherin. Wells coated with saturating amounts of N-cadherin or BSA were then incubated with the various GST-PTP1B fusions, as well as with GST only, as a control. After washing and blocking the wells with BSA, the amount of PTP1B bound was determined using anti-PTP1B antibody, which recognizes all the PTP1B mutants equally well (see Fig. 2 A), followed by an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Optimal binding of PTP1B to immobilized N-cadherin depends on phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Fusion proteins lacking phosphorylated tyrosine residues, the C215S triple mutant (Y66F/Y152F/Y153F), and the wild-type bind minimally, showing only about 25% that of the C215S mutant with no substituted tyrosine residues (Fig. 3 A). Among the C215S mutants bearing one Tyr → Phe substitution, only the Y152F shows a significant reduction in binding, suggesting that residue 152 is the most critical determinant of PTP1B binding to N-cadherin in vitro. In agreement with this, the C215S double mutants containing a 152 mutation (Y66F/Y152F and Y152F/Y153F) also show reduced binding, whereas the C215S Y66F/Y153F double mutant binds as well as the unsubstituted C215S (Fig. 3). These results are true over a wide concentration range (Fig. 3 B); concentrations of C215S PTP1B that show saturation binding still fail to show binding of the Y152F mutant. It is interesting to note that the Y66F mutant actually facilitates binding. To determine the interaction of the PTP1B mutants with N-cadherin in cells, the several PTP1B cDNA constructs were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(+)zeo vector and transfected into LN-cells (14Balsamo J. Arregui C. Leung T.-C. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A 9-amino acid sequence coding for the hemagglutinin sequence was added to the amino terminus of the PTP1B sequence to facilitate detection of the transfected enzyme. Stable cell clones were established by culturing in the presence of Zeocin and Geneticin (for stable N-cadherin expression). Cells were grown to near confluency, lysed with nonionic detergent in the presence of tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Immunoprecipitated material was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes, and the membranes were probed with anti-N-cadherin antibody (NCD-2) and anti-PTP1B antibody (Fig.4 A). In agreement with what we observed in the in vitro binding assays, the Y152F mutation alone is enough to eliminate binding to N-cadherin (Fig.4 A). Furthermore, all combinations of mutant tyrosine residues that include Tyr-152 behave identically (not shown), whereas mutation at tyrosine residues 66 and 153 alone (Fig. 4 A) or in combination (not shown) have no effect on binding of PTP1B to N-cadherin. As in embryonic chick retina cells (13Balsamo J. Leung T.-C. Ernst H. Zanin M.K.B. Hoffman S. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), endogenous PTP1B is associated with N-cadherin in control LN-cells (transfected with vector alone) and is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (Fig. 4 B). Expression of the dominant-negative C215S mutant PTP1B in LN-cells prevents the association of endogenous PTP1B with N-cadherin (see Fig. 4 Band Ref. 14Balsamo J. Arregui C. Leung T.-C. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of PTP1B carrying both the C215S and the Y152F mutations does not alter the association of endogenous PTP1B with N-cadherin. Thus tyrosine 152 is critical for in situ binding and displacement of endogenous PTP1B from cadherin. The catalytically inactive C215S PTP1B mutant acts as a dominant-negative when introduced into LN-cells, inhibiting N-cadherin-mediated cell interaction (14Balsamo J. Arregui C. Leung T.-C. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). By introducing a mutation that eliminates binding to N-cadherin in the C215S PTP1B, the dominant-negative effect should be abolished; this is indeed the case (Fig. 5). N-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion is abolished in the C215S mutants but restored in the C215S mutants that also have a Y152F mutation. In comparison, mutations in tyrosine residues 66 and 153 alone or in combination have no effect (Fig. 5). This effect on N-cadherin-mediated adhesion is reflected in the cells phenotype; LN-cells grow in clusters of tightly adherent cells because of expression of N-cadherin (Fig.6 A; see also Ref. 14Balsamo J. Arregui C. Leung T.-C. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the dominant-negative C215S mutant this phenotype is lost because of inactivation of N-cadherin (compare Fig. 6, A andB) but recovered in the C215S mutant bearing the Y152F mutation (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, mutation of either tyrosine 66 or 153 has little or no effect on the dominant-negative phenotype.Figure 6Morphology and localization of N-cadherin among LN-cells transfected with catalytically inactive PTP1B mutated at key tyrosine residues and visualized with anti-N-cadherin antibody. WT, wild-type; C215S, catalytically inactive; Y66F, Y152F,Y153F, and Y6/2/3F (triple mutant), catalytically inactive forms containing mutations at the indicated tyrosine residues. Note that among the forms bearing mutations at tyrosine residues, only cells transfected with forms mutated at Tyr-152 revert to a tightly adherent population with N-cadherin present at cell-cell boundaries.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our laboratory has demonstrated that PTP1B interacts directly with N-cadherin and that phosphorylation of PTP1B on tyrosine residues is necessary for this association (13Balsamo J. Leung T.-C. Ernst H. Zanin M.K.B. Hoffman S. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 14Balsamo J. Arregui C. Leung T.-C. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We now identify tyrosine residue 152 in PTP1B as the critical residue for PTP1B-N-cadherin interaction. PTP1B mutants that have tyrosine 152 replaced by phenylalanine do not interact with N-cadherin in in vitrobinding assays. Moreover, in L-cells expressing N-cadherin and HA-tagged PTP1B carrying the Y152F and C215S double mutation, HA-PTP1B does not coimmunoprecipitate with N-cadherin, indicating a lack of association between the two molecules in situ. This is also reflected in the loss of the dominant-negative effect on adhesion of the C215S mutation on N-cadherin function. Furthermore, in LN-cells expressing the Y152F mutation endogenous PTP1B is associated with N-cadherin, and it is tyrosine- phosphorylated. The multiple intracellular roles played by PTP1B require interactions with many different intracellular partners. The needed binding specificity appears to be achieved by compartmentalization or by targeting mediated by specific domains. The carboxyl terminus of PTP1B directs its localization to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum, thus restricting the number of potential interactors (20Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). In platelets and activated T-cells, proteolytic cleavage in the ER targeting domain results in translocation of PTP1B to the cytoskeletal/membrane fraction (27Frangioni J.V. Oda A. Smith M. Salzman E. Neel B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4843-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 28Ezumi Y. Takayama H. Okuma M. J. Biol.

This cleavage is dependent on integrin engagement, resulting in increased Ca2+ levels and, consequently, activation of calpain. We also find that PTP1B associated with N-cadherin in vivo migrates faster on SDS-PAGE than the intact ∼50-kDa enzyme, suggesting cleavage (13Balsamo J. Leung T.-C. Ernst H. Zanin M.K.B. Hoffman S. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar,14Balsamo J. Arregui C. Leung T.-C. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The N-cadherin-associated PTP1B represents a small fraction of the total and colocalizes with N-cadherin in sites of cell-cell contacts and at the tips of growing neurites (14Balsamo J. Arregui C. Leung T.-C. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30Pathre, P., Arregui, C., Wampler, T., Kue, I., Leung, T.-C., Lilien, J., and Balsamo, J. (2001) J. Neurosci. Res., in press.Google Scholar). Elimination of the ER localization signal does not alter the interaction of PTP1B with N-cadherin, suggesting that targeting of PTP1B to the N-cadherin complex does not depend on prior targeting to the ER. Furthermore, targeting to specific plasma membrane locations does not appear to depend on cleavage of the ER targeting sequence, as the PTP1B associated with focal adhesion complexes (24Arregui C. Balsamo J. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and the insulin receptor (22Bandyopadhyay D. Kusari A. Kenner K.A. Liu F. Chernoff J. Gustafson T.A. Kusari J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1639-1645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) have an apparent molecular mass of ∼50 kDa. Phosphorylation on tyrosine residues is important for targeting of PTP1B to at least two of its interacting partners. As we demonstrate here, phosphorylation of tyrosine 152 is critical for binding to N-cadherin. Additionally, interaction of PTP1B with the insulin receptor results in phosphorylation of tyrosine residues 66 and 152/153. Phosphorylation of these residues further promotes binding to the receptor. Tyrosine 66 is the major target for phosphorylation of PTP1B by the insulin receptor, creating a site essential for downstream signaling (22Bandyopadhyay D. Kusari A. Kenner K.A. Liu F. Chernoff J. Gustafson T.A. Kusari J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1639-1645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation on PTP1B does not appear to play a role in the binding of PTP1B to p130cas (25Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This interaction, which probably mediates targeting of PTP1B to the integrin complex, is mediated by a proline-rich, SH3-binding domain in PTP1B (25Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These differences highlight the fact that even though PTP1B is a ubiquitous enzyme, it plays a pivotal role in regulating many cellular functions through specific protein-protein interactions."

In strains with a <i>psd1Δ</i> allele for the mitochondrial PtdSer decarboxylase, the conversion of nascent PtdSer to PtdEtn can serve as an indicator of lipid transport to the locus of PtdSer decarboxylase 2 (Psd2p) in the Golgi/vacuole. We have followed the metabolism of [<sup>3</sup>H]serine into PtdSer and PtdEtn to study lipid transport in permeabilized <i>psd1Δ</i> yeast. The permeabilized cells synthesize <sup>3</sup>H-PtdSer and, after a 20-min lag, decarboxylate it to form [<sup>3</sup>H]PtdEtn. Formation of [<sup>3</sup>H]PtdEtn is linear between 20 and 100 min of incubation and does not require ongoing PtdSer synthesis. PtdSer transport can be resolved into a two-component system using washed, permeabilized<i>psd1Δ</i> cells as donors and membranes isolated by ultracentrifugation as acceptors. With this system, the transport-dependent decarboxylation of nascent PtdSer is dependent upon the concentration of acceptor membranes, requires Mn<sup>2+</sup> but not nucleotides, and is inhibited by EDTA. High speed membranes isolated from a previously identified PtdSer transport mutant, <i>pstB2</i>, contain normal Psd2p activity but fail to reconstitute PtdSer transport and decarboxylation. Reconstitution with permutations of wild type and <i>pstB2Δ</i> donors and acceptors identifies the site of the mutant defect as the acceptor side of the transport reaction."

The sedimentation and translational diffusion coefficients as well as the molecular weight and buoyant density of rat mitochondrial ribosomes were determined. Sedimentation coefficients were established using the time-derivative algorithm (Philo, J. S. (2000) Anal. Biochem. 279, 151–163). The sedimentation coefficients of the intact monosome, large subunit, and small subunit were 55, 39, and 28 S, respectively. Mitochondrial ribosomes had a particle composition of 75% protein and 25% RNA. The partial specific volume was 0.688 ml/g, as determined from the protein and RNA composition. The buoyant density of formaldehyde-fixed ribosomes in cesium chloride was 1.41 g/cm3. The molecular masses of mitochondrial and E. coli ribosomes determined by static light-scattering experiments were 3.57 ± 0.14 MDa and 2.49 ± 0.06 MDa, respectively. The diffusion coefficient obtained from dynamic light-scattering measurements was 1.10 ± 0.01 × 10−7 cm2s−1 for mitochondrial ribosomes and 1.72 ± 0.03 × 10−7 cm2s−1 for the 70 S E. coli monosome. The hydration factor determined from these hydrodynamic parameters were 4.6 g of water/g of ribosome and 1.3 g/g for mitochondrial andE. coli ribosomes, respectively. A calculated hydration factor of 3.3 g/g for mitochondrial ribosomes was also obtained utilizing a calculated molecular mass and the Svedberg equation. These measurements of solvation suggest that ribosomes are highly hydrated structures. They are also in agreement with current models depicting ribosomes as porous structures containing numerous gaps and tunnels.

Int. Rev. Cytol. 1985; 93: 93-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Mitochondria DNA deletions or mutations of mitochondrial tRNAs can lead to impairment of polypeptide synthesis and defects in energy production (2Fromenty B. Grimbert S. Mansouri A. Beaugrand M. Erlinger S. Rotig A. Pessayre D. Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 3Chinnery P.F. Turnbull D.M. Lancet. 1999; 354: S117-S121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Likewise, in animal models of alcoholic liver disease, chronic ethanol consumption decreases the mitochondrial synthesis of ATP due to lowered concentrations of all 13 polypeptides encoded by the mitochondrial genome (4Coleman W.B. Cunningham C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, in this latter case, the depressed functioning of the oxidative phosphorylation system is due to alterations in mitochondrial ribosome function and structure (5Coleman W.B. Cunningham C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1058: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Cahill A. Baio D.L. Ivester P. Cunningham C.C. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1996; 20: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These observations provide another type of mitochondrial disorder that may play a role in pathologies associated with alterations in the mitochondrial protein synthesizing mechanism. Our previous studies demonstrated the need to characterize rat liver mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes)1 more rigorously to determine whether alterations in function are accompanied by changes in the physical properties, i.e. molecular weight and overall shape. In the present study, a combination of approaches have been employed to determine the physiochemical properties of rat liver mitoribosomes. These included sedimentation velocity measurements with an analytical ultracentrifuge, light-scattering analyses, and electron microscopy. In previous studies of rat liver mitoribosomes (7O'Brien T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3409-3417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sacchi A. Cerbone F. Cammarano P. Ferrini U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 308: 309-403Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 9Cahill A. Baio D.L. Cunningham C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the sedimentation coefficient was determined on a sucrose density gradient utilizing Escherichia coli ribosomes as a standard. In the present investigation, we have applied a rigorous approach in determining the sedimentation coefficient, namely the time-derivative algorithm as described by Stafford (10Stafford III., W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) and Philo (11Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This procedure has been used to determine the distribution of sedimenting species from sedimentation velocity data obtained in an analytical ultracentrifuge. The time derivative has several advantages when compared with conventional analyses, including a higher signal-to-noise ratio, and the ability to resolve the components of a mixture (10Stafford III., W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). This latter characteristic was useful in the present study in evaluating whether the intact ribosome dissociated during sedimentation velocity measurements. Static and dynamic light scattering were employed to measure the molecular weight and translational diffusion coefficient for the rat liver mitoribosomes. The latter parameter can be utilized to determine the Stokes radius of a particle and was employed with electron microscopic analyses to estimate the shape and water content of rat liver mitoribosomes. The light-scattering analyses were particularly useful in this study because measurements can be carried out quickly under conditions that precluded ribosome dissociation. To validate the techniques employed to characterize the rat liver mitoribosomes, we applied the same procedures to characterize the physiochemical properties of the well described E. coli ribosome (12Svergun D.I. Burkhardt N. Pederson-Skov J. Koch M.H.J. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Merrwink W. Stuhrmann H.B. Diedrich G. Nierhaus K.H. J. Mol.

Biol. 1998; 280: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The sedimentation velocity analyses and the light-scattering measurements revealed a molecular weight for rat liver mitoribosomes that is higher than that reported previously for either rat liver (8Sacchi A. Cerbone F. Cammarano P. Ferrini U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 308: 309-403Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) or beef liver (14Hamilton M.G. O'Brien T.W. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5400-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This difference in mass between rat and beef liver mitoribosomes is consistent with the earlier finding that only 15% of mitoribosomal proteins had conserved electrophoretic properties (15Pietromonaco S.F. Hessler R.A. O'Brien T.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 24: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and also with the suggestion that mitoribosomal proteins have a high evolutionary rate (15Pietromonaco S.F. Hessler R.A. O'Brien T.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 24: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the present investigation yielded a diffusion coefficient for mitoribosomes, which had not been reported previously. From this parameter an estimation of the solvation was determined, which indicated that these ribosomes are highly hydrated particles. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Zivic Miller Laboratories, Inc. (Zelienople, PA). Rats were allowed 1 week to acclimatize prior to experimental studies. Ultrapure sucrose was obtained from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Aurora, OH). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. The isolation of ribosomes was as described by Cahill et al. (9Cahill A. Baio D.L. Cunningham C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), except that a mixture of protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (40 μg/ml), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), pepstatin A (7 μg/ml), and aprotonin (5 μg/ml)) was added to the buffers used in the isolation. After fractionation by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (9Cahill A. Baio D.L. Cunningham C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the fraction exhibiting the highest absorbance at 260 nm was collected for subsequent analyses by analytical ultracentrifugation and light-scattering measurements. This fraction typically exhibited a 260 nm/280 nm absorbance ratio of 1.4–1.5. The concentration of ribosomes was determined utilizing an E 0.1%,1cm260= 7.5 (see “Results” for extinction coefficient determination). The activity of purified mitochondrial 55 S ribosomes was measured using a poly(U) directed [3H]phenylalanine polymerization assay as described previously (9Cahill A. Baio D.L. Cunningham C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), with the exception that activity was measured using ribosomes obtained from the peak maxima of sucrose density gradients. The purified ribosomes were analyzed for possible contamination with the α-ketoglutarate (OGDC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes (PDC) by monitoring for dehydrogenase activities (16Fahien L.A. Teller J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10411-10422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dehydrogenase complex subunits by immunoblotting technology (17Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44841) Google Scholar) employing the Pierce SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit. Antibody against the E1 subunit of PDC and purified PDC E1 subunit were kindly provided by Dr. M. S. Patel (State University of New York, Buffalo, NY). Dr. G. Lindsay (University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland) generously provided purified OGDC and the antiserum against OGDC. E. coliribosomes were prepared according to Rheinberger et al. (18Rheinberger H.J. Geigenmuller U. Wedde M. Nierhaus K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 658-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) utilizing E. coli strain MRE600 (an RNase I−strain) to minimize ribonuclease levels. Ribosomes were shock-frozen and stored at −80 °C until utilized. For sedimentation velocity analysis in buffer A (30 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol), ribosomes were thawed on ice, diluted with buffer A to give absorbances of 0.7–1.2 units/ml, and subsequently used for analytical ultracentrifugation. For sedimentation velocity analysis in sucrose, ribosomes were immediately loaded onto a 10–30% sucrose gradient prepared in buffer A and centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 14 h in a Beckman SW27 rotor. The gradients were fractionated and absorbances monitored at 260 and 280 nm. Peaks corresponding to purified E. coli ribosomes were subsequently used for analytical ultracentrifugation and light-scattering analyses. The concentration of ribosomes was determined utilizing an E 0.1%,1cm260= 14.5 (19Tissieres A. Watson J.D. Schlessinger D. Hollingworth B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1959; 1: 221-233Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar,20Hill W.E. Rossetti G.P. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 44: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The published value of 0.639 ml/g was used for the partial specific volume (ν̄) (19Tissieres A. Watson J.D. Schlessinger D. Hollingworth B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1959; 1: 221-233Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 21Allen S.H. Wong K.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The purified 55 S peak fraction from the sucrose density gradient was dialyzed overnight in buffer B (100 mm KCl, 20 mmMgCl2, 20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), containing 1% formaldehyde. The refractive index of the sample was measured to ensure no sucrose was present. Buoyant density measurements of formaldehyde-fixed ribosomes in cesium chloride were carried out in buffer B according to Spirinet al. (22Spirin A.S. Belitsina N.V. Lerman M.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 14: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This procedure reliably stabilizes ribosomes by fixing the particles with formaldehyde. Inadequate fixation results in loss of ribosomal proteins and artificially high buoyant density values (22Spirin A.S. Belitsina N.V. Lerman M.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 14: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Centrifugation at 187,000 × g in a Beckman SW41 Ti rotor was carried out at 4 °C for 48 h. Fractions were collected, and the density was determined according to Ifft et al. (23Ifft J.B. Voet D.H. Vinograd J. J. Phys. Chem. 1961; 65: 1138-1145Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Absorbance readings of the fractions were measured at 260 nm. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 4 °C using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Bovine serum albumin samples with an absorbance at 280 nm of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 were utilized to determine the linearity of the XL-A's optical system. Ribosome boundary movements at a rotor speed of 21,000 rpm, and at fixed time intervals (3 min) as a function of the radius (0.003 radial step size), were obtained over a period of 5 h. Ribosome sample concentrations between 0.05 and 0.16 mg/ml were sufficiently dilute such that they behaved as ideal, noninteracting species. Data were analyzed by several software applications. First, DCDT+ version 1.02 (Dr. John S. Philo, Thousand Oaks, CA) was applied using the time-derivative algorithm (11Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This software was used to analyze sequential files selected to conform to the criteria defined by Stafford (10Stafford III., W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) to obtain apparent g(s*) distribution plots of sedimenting species (i.e. uncorrected for diffusion). This analysis can also resolve more than one species by fitting the data to a Gaussian function. Second, the Fujita-MacCosham function based on the Lamm equation (24Philo J.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (212) Google Scholar) using the software SVEDBERG, version 6.23 (Dr. John S. Philo, Thousand Oaks, CA) was also employed. This analysis can resolve sedimentation coefficients of more than one species and can fit data obtained over a long time range. Third, the van Holde-Weischet procedure (25van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) using the software UltraScan 4.1 (Dr. Borries Demeler, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX) was used to determine the sedimentation coefficient distribution of the sample corrected for diffusion and to provide information on the homogeneity of the sample. Experimentally determined sedimentation coefficients were corrected for the effects of temperature, solvent density (buffer A, 0.9997 g/cm3; buffer B, 1.008 g/cm3) and viscosity (buffer A, 1.57 centipoise; buffer B, 1.57 centipoise). Sedimentation coefficients of samples in sucrose were corrected for solvent density and viscosity as a function of concentration and temperature using standard tables (26Sober H.A. CRC Handbook of Biochemistry. 1st Ed. Chemical Rubber Co., Cleveland, OH1968Google Scholar). Sedimentation coefficients obtained with the software described above were converted from 4 °C to water at 20 °C to obtain s20,w values (27Holladay L.A. Rivier J. Puett D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4895-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the intact ribosome was calculated from the Svedberg equation (28Svedberg T. Peterson K.O. Fowler R.H. Kapitza P. The Ultracentrifuge. Clarendon Press, Oxford1940Google Scholar) utilizing thes20,w and the translational diffusion coefficient (Dt) corrected to water at 20 °C (i.e. D20,w). TheD20,w was obtained from dynamic light-scattering analysis (see below). The molecular weight of purified 55 S ribosomes was determined by static light scattering, using a Brookhaven Instrument BI-2030AT correlator, operated together with a BI-200SM light-scattering goniometer/photon counting detector (Brookhaven Instruments, Holtsville, NY) and a Spectra Physics 127 helium-neon laser (35 milliwatts, equipped with a vertical polarization rotator; Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CT) (29Hantgan R.R. Braaten J.V. Rocco M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3935-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Hantgan R.R. Paumi C. Rocco M. Weisel J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14461-14474Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The fraction with maximal absorbance at 260 nm obtained from the sucrose density gradient was used for molecular weight determinations. Light-scattering measurements were made at an angle of 90o in specially formulated microcuvettes (Hellma Cells, Inc., White Plains, NY) maintained at 15 °C in a refractive index matching bath (containing 50% glycerol). Samples were passed through a 0.2-μm filter, with the filtrate collected into acid-washed, dust-free microcuvettes. Intensity measurements from duplicate or triplicate runs were averaged and used for molecular weight calculations. An aliquot of the sample was also utilized for sedimentation velocity studies to provide information on the intactness of the particle. As a consequence, only preparations showing no dissociation were utilized in all analyses. The viscosity and concentration of sucrose in the ribosome sample was determined from the refractive index of sucrose using an Abbe refractometer. Corrections for solvent (i.e. sucrose) scattering were obtained by subtracting the intensity measurement determined of blank samples (which had the same sucrose concentration as the ribosome sample) obtained from a control 10–30% sucrose gradient. Sample scattering intensities were expressed relative to a benzene standard (29Hantgan R.R. Braaten J.V. Rocco M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3935-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Hantgan R.R. Paumi C. Rocco M. Weisel J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14461-14474Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Ribosome concentrations were determined from 260 nm absorbance measurements using an extinction coefficient of mitoribosomes determined from the protein and RNA composition (Ref. 31Hamilton M.G. Ruth M.E. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar; see “Results”). The published refractive index increment (dn/dc) for E. coli ribosome particles (30, 50, and 70 S) of 0.20 cm3/g (32Scafati A.R. Stornaiuolo M.R. Novaro P. Biophys. J. 1971; 11: 370-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was used in molecular weight calculations. Weight-average molecular weights were determined from the solvent corrected relative scattering intensity (at 90o) using Rayleigh-Gans-Debye theory (33Johnson C.S. Gabriel D.A. Bell J.E. Spectroscopy in Biochemistr. II. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1981: 177-272Google Scholar). Dynamic light scattering was carried out simultaneously with the same sample used for static light scattering. Measurements were carried out with the detector aperture set at 0.4 or 0.8 mm to optimize the signal to noise ratio (which ranged from 0.13 to 0.25). The intensity-normalized photocount autocorrelation function was used to determine the translational diffusion coefficient Dt by cumulants analysis (33Johnson C.S. Gabriel D.A. Bell J.E. Spectroscopy in Biochemistr. II. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1981: 177-272Google Scholar, 34Koppel D.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1972; 57: 4814-4820Crossref Scopus (2714) Google Scholar, 35Berne B.J. Pecora R. Dynamic Light Scattering with Applications to Chemistry, Biology and Physics. R. E. Krieger Publishing Co., Malabar, FL1990Google Scholar). The Dt was corrected for temperature and solvent viscosity to water at 20 °C (i.e.D20,w) (36Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry; Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1980Google Scholar). TheD20,w was subsequently employed to determine the particle size (Stokes radius) utilizing the Einstein-Sutherland equation (37Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley & Sons, New York1961: 356-365Google Scholar). Data analysis of the autocorrelation function also provided an index of the homogeneity of each sample (see “Results”). Additional information about sample heterogeneity was obtained by CONTIN analysis (38Provencher S.W. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 229-242Crossref Scopus (2519) Google Scholar) to obtain plots of the distribution of scattering components. Ribosomes obtained from the peak maxima of sucrose gradients were utilized for electron microscopy. Aliquots of particles were placed on carbon-coated grids and negatively stained with uranyl acetate (39Haschemeyer R.H. Meyers R.J. Hayat M.A. Principles and Techniques of Electron Microscopy: Biological Applications. II. University Park Press, Baltimore, MD1981: 110-143Google Scholar). Micrographs were taken at a magnification of 70,800 with a Phillips 400 transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kev. Particle diameter measurements were randomly recorded from digitized images of 70–100 ribosomes. The length and width of particles were also assessed when ribosomes were orientated in the frontal view. Unless otherwise stated, results from all experiments are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of six observations. The rat liver mitochondrial ribosomes utilized in this study displayed a sucrose density gradient sedimentation profile identical to that reported by Cahill et al. (9Cahill A. Baio D.L. Cunningham C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The peak absorbance fraction gave a 260:280 ratio of between 1.4–1.5, which is in good agreement with previous observations (9Cahill A. Baio D.L. Cunningham C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Since OGDC and PDC complexes have sedimentation coefficients of 36 and 70 S, respectively, the preparation was checked for possible contamination. No pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was detected. Measurement of OGDC activity indicated that 1.4% of the protein in the ribosomal preparation could be this enzyme complex. Analyses of immunoblots were also carried out using purified OGDC and purified E1 subunits of PDC as standards. These analyses suggested that no more than 0.05% and 1.2% of the total protein in the ribosome preparation could be PDC and OGDC, respectively. This indicates that the ribosome preparation is not significantly contaminated with these enzyme complexes, an observation also substantiated by the residual analyses of sedimentation velocity and light-scattering measurements (see below). The translation activity of the purified ribosome, measured by polymerization of phenylalanine, was 0.02 pmol of phenylalanine polymerized/min/pmol of ribosomes. These preparations demonstrated no activity in the absence of soluble translation factors. The sedimentation properties of ribosome samples taken from the peak maxima at 260 nm of the sucrose gradient were analyzed by various algorithms. Using the time-derivative method, sedimentation data were transformed into an overall distribution of sedimenting species to obtain the g(s*) plot shown in Fig.1 A. Fig. 1 B shows data from E. coli ribosomes that will be discussed in a subsequent section. Fig. 1 Ademonstrates the application of the DCDT+ analysis, which shows the monosome fitted to a one-species Gaussian distribution centered at 54.0 S with no detectable amounts of its 39 and 28 S subunits. The peak sedimentation coefficient determined by this procedure was 55.1 S (Table I). The ribosome sample in sucrose showed very little dissociation, which was verified with the SVEDBERG analysis that resulted in a single species fit (55 S) from six out of eight preparations. In addition, from the SVEDBERG analysis, the residuals of this typical fit resulted in a root-mean-square deviation of 0.02 absorbance units. A summary of the sedimentation coefficients of ribosomes utilizing the DCDT+ and SVEDBERG software procedures is shown in Table I. In all preparations, the sedimentation coefficient was independent of concentration over the range of 0.05–0.16 mg/ml.Table ISummary of sedimentation coefficients of mitochondrial and E. coli ribosomes determined by various software analysesAnalysesMitoribosomesE. coliDCDT+ one-species, peak s20,wvalue55.1 ± 0.6 (8)66.7 ± 0.4 (4)SVEDBERG one-species,s20,w54.9 ± 0.4 (8)66.3 ± 0.4 (4)DCDT+ (dissociated, first species, peaks20,w value)28.4DCDT+ (dissociated, second species, peaks20,w value)38.9The numbers in parentheses are the numbers of preparations analyzed.

To further validate the DCDT+ analysis procedure, sedimentation velocity data were also analyzed using the van Holde-Weischet method. Fig. 2 A illustrates absorbance scans taken at fixed time intervals to monitor the movement of sample through the cell. From the extrapolation plot observed in Fig.2 B, the convergence of apparent sedimentation coefficients on the y intercept indicates that the mitoribosome sample is nearly homogeneous. This finding was reflected in the integral distribution of s-values plot (Fig. 2 C), where 94% of the sample sedimented at ∼54–55 S. A small amount of sample (6%) corresponded to dissociated ribosome particles, as verified from the SVEDBERG analysis. There was no evidence of any other particle sedimenting higher than the 55 S monosome. This procedure therefore confirms the findings obtained from the DCDT+ and SVEDBERG analyses. Two of eight preparations showed the presence of a small fraction sedimenting at 39 S. This was attributed to a minor amount of dissociation in these two preparations. The effect of dissociating the mitochondrial monosome by increasing the potassium and decreasing the magnesium concentrations resulted in two overlapping peaks, with peak sedimentation coefficients of 39 S (large subunit) and 28 S (small subunit) (data not shown). This dissociation pattern is similar to that obtained with bovine liver mitochondrial ribosomes (7O'Brien T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3409-3417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

RuvAB is a branch migration complex that stimulates heterologous strand exchange. Previous studies indicate that RuvAB increases the rate at which heteroduplex products are formed by RecA, that RuvA and RuvB are required for this stimulation, and that RuvAB does not stimulate homologous strand exchange. This study indicates that MutS,L inhibit the formation of full-length heteroduplex DNA between M13-fd DNA in the presence of RuvAB, such that less than 2% of the linear substrate is converted to product. Inhibition depends on the time at which MutS,L are added to the reaction and is strongest when MutS,L are added during initiation. The kinetics of the strand exchange reaction suggest that MutS,L directly inhibit RuvAB-dependent branch migration in the absence of RecA. The inhibition requires the formation of base-base mismatches and ATP utilization; no effect on RuvAB-promoted strand exchange is seen if an ATP-deficient mutant of MutS (MutS501) is included in the reaction instead of wild-type MutS. These results are consistent with a role for MutS,L in maintaining genomic stability and replication fidelity.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3614-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have shown that sequence divergence acts as a potential barrier to recombination and that this barrier is enhanced by the action of MR proteins. Specifically, in conjugational crosses between E. coli andSalmonella typhimurium, whose sequences are 80% identical, mutations in the E. coli MR genes mutH,mutL, mutS, and mutU increase recombination rates 50- to 3000-fold (1Rayssiguier C. Thaler D.S. Radman M. Nature. 1989; 342: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the antirecombinational activity of MutS and MutL modulates recombination between diverged sequences (9Shen P. Huang H.V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 358-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and between large chromosomal duplications that differ by as little as 1% at the nucleotide level (1Rayssiguier C. Thaler D.S. Radman M. Nature. 1989; 342: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 22Alani E. Reenan R.A. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1994; 137: 19-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Borts R.H. Leung W.Y. Kramer W. Kramer B. Williamson M. Fogel S. Haber J.E. Genetics. 1990; 124: 573-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antirecombinational activity associated with key components of MR presumably stems from their ability to recognize and bind mismatched base pairs in newly formed heteroduplex DNA. However, the precise mechanism by which MutS and MutL modulate homeologous recombination has not been defined. In principle, the following potential roles for MR are envisioned in this process. (1Rayssiguier C. Thaler D.S. Radman M. Nature. 1989; 342: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) Functioning as a mismatch-sensing system, MutS,L modulate the extent of exchange by testing for the presence of mismatched base pairs during DNA exchange. In addition, or alternatively, (2Rayssiguier C. Dohet C. Radman M. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) mimicking replication fidelity, MR signals downstream components and ultimately resolves/aborts newly formed heteroduplex DNA in response to the presence of mismatches. Worth et al. (24Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3238-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) have shown that MutS inhibits the RecA-catalyzed in vitro three-strand transfer reaction between M13 and fd DNA, whose sequences are diverged by 3%. MutL enhances the MutS-dependent inhibition of strand exchange. That MutL was without effect in the absence of MutS suggests that the role of MutL in homeologous recombination is similar in nature to its role in replication error repair. MutS and MutL have no effect on homologous strand exchange using M13-M13 (or fd-fd) DNA, indicating that MutS,L-dependent inhibition of strand exchange requires the presence of base-base mispairs in newly formed heteroduplex DNA. In support of a mechanism in which recombination is regulated by MR, it has been demonstrated that the enhanced block by MutL is coupled to MutS and ATP (25Worth Jr., L. Bader T. Yang J. Clark S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23176-23182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). E. coli RuvA and RuvB proteins are involved in repair of UV damage and form a two-component multimer that facilitates branch migration through regions of heterology during later stages of recombination (26Iype L.E. Wood E.A. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24967-24978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Iype L.E. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19473-19480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Indeed, genetic studies suggest that theruvA and ruvB gene products are largely responsible for bypass of DNA heterology during conjugative recombination or interspecies DNA exchange (28Matic I. Radman M. Rayssiguier C. Genetics. 1994; 136: 17-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Stambuk S. Radman M. Genetics. 1998; 150: 533-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is highly probable that the role of RecA is somewhat diminished during this type of recombination, especially when sequence divergence is encountered. Biochemical studies have shown that RuvAB binds specifically to three- and four-stranded junctions, promotes DNA exchange, bypasses regions of DNA heterology, and when divergence is high, actually reverses the polarity of branch migration in vitro (27Iype L.E. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19473-19480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 30Adams D.E. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 582-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This latter observation leads to the idea that RuvAB could act as an anti-recombinase when DNA heterology is encountered. Studies by Bianchi and Radding (31Bianchi M.E. Radding C.M. Cell. 1983; 35: 511-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) show that RecA promotes branch migration through regions of imperfect homology (Fig.1); however, as little as 3% heterology between DNA substrates interferes with the efficiency of strand exchange in vitro (24Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3238-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 31Bianchi M.E. Radding C.M. Cell. 1983; 35: 511-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Larger heterologies (i.e. 200 bp and up) are not bypassed by RecA alone but require RuvAB in addition to RecA. This result is consistent with the suggestion that RuvAB plays a role in recombination, specifically after strand invasion (26Iype L.E. Wood E.A. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24967-24978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The goal of this work is to examine the influence of RuvAB on M13-fd strand exchange initiated by RecA in the absence and presence of MutS,L. The results show that RuvAB enhances the rate of formation of open circular heteroduplex DNA between M13-fd DNA by 2- to 3-fold. Addition of MutS,L to the reaction abrogates the ability of RuvAB to enhance the rate of RecA-catalyzed product formation. Because M13-M13 exchange is not affected by the presence of RuvAB, it is likely that this block is a mismatch-dependent event. Sequence divergence inhibits branch migration in the presence of MutS,L, suggesting that the MR proteins recognize heterology and destabilize the RecA-DNA and/or RuvAB-DNA complexes on heterologous DNA. E. coli proteins MutL and 6x-His-tagged wild-type MutS and MutS501 were purified as described previously (24Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recombinant nontagged wild-type MutS was constructed by inserting theBamHI-HindIII fragment from pLW10 into theBamHI-HindIII site of pQE51 expression vector (Qiagen) to yield pLW40. M15pREP4 cells transformed with pLW40 were grown in 6 × 2L Luria Broth to an A595 of 0.6, chilled, and induced as described previously (24Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal.

SSB protein was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Restriction endonuclease SnaBI and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from New England Biolabs, Inc. RecA protein, proteinase K, phosphocreatine kinase, and phosphocreatine were purchased from Sigma. Single-stranded circular M13 and fd bacteriophage DNA was prepared as described (24Worth L.J.

Replicative forms of M13 and fd bacteriophage DNA were linearized with SnaBI restriction endonuclease. For experiments with branched intermediates, linear DNA (50 pmol of 5′-ends) was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified as previously described (24Worth L.J.

RuvA, RuvB, and MutS were purified to greater than 95% homogeneity (Fig. 2) and characterized (26Iype L.E. Wood E.A. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol.

A standard reaction was carried out in a total volume of 60 μl containing 50 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 12 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm ATP, 6 mm phosphocreatine, 140 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 10.6 μm single-stranded circular fd DNA (M13), 3.5 μm RecA, 8.4 μm linear double-stranded M13 DNA (fd), 0.4 μm SSB protein, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Preincubation of RecA and single-stranded circular DNA was for 10 min at 37 °C followed by linear duplex DNA and an additional 10 min at this same temperature. Reactions were initiated by the addition of SSB and ATP. Aliquots (14.5 μl) were removed at indicated times, quenched with a final concentration of 0.1% SDS, 25 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 153 μg/ml proteinase K, and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. After deproteinizing, 2 μl of load buffer (20% Ficoll 400, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.0% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol) was added, and samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel for 18 h at 2 V/cm. DNA was visualized with ethidium bromide, photographed using the FOTO/Analyst documentation system from Fotodyne, and quantified by NIH Image 1.61. Reactions in the presence of RuvA (60 nm) and RuvB (200 nm) were performed in a similar manner. Initially, a time course of 0, 15, 30, and 45 min was performed to examine the effect of RuvAB on both M13-M13 and M13-fd incubations. RuvAB inhibited the reaction when added before branched intermediates could form (data not shown); therefore, RuvAB was added at 10–15 min (M13-M13) or 35–40 min (M13-fd) after ATP was added to initiate the reaction. Branched intermediate formation was relatively steady during these times. Controls were supplemented with RuvA and RuvB diluent buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol). Reactions were carried out as described previously, except that MutS (90 nm) and MutL (90 nm) were added just prior to SSB and ATP. Control reactions were supplemented with MutS and MutL dilution buffers (20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). To test the effects of mismatch recognition on the strand exchange process, both MutS and MutL were premixed on ice and then added at different times during the incubation (65 min). Reactions were carried out as described above, and the times of MutS,L additions are indicated in Figs. 4 B and5 B. Analysis was performed as described following formation of open circular product (full-length heteroduplex).Figure 5Strand exchange between M13-fd in the presence of only RuvAB or MutS,L and RuvAB.

Reactions were quenched after 15 min at 37 °C for M13-M13 strand exchange and after 30 min for M13-fd strand exchange with 40 μl of 0.1% SDS, 25 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 153 μg/ml proteinase K and incubated an additional 15 min at 37 °C. The samples were applied to a Sepharose CL-2B column (3.5 ml) at room temperature as described (36Tsaneva I.R. Muller B. West S.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Sample aliquots were collected (250 μl), and the concentration was determined by quantitation of 32P-labeled DNA. Detection of branched intermediates (10 μl) was accomplished with ethidium bromide staining on agarose gel (0.8%), and those fractions were combined and concentrated using Microcon 30 (Amicon, Inc.) to a final volume of 50 μl. Branched intermediates generated by RecA between either M13-M13 or M13-fd DNA (2 μm) were supplemented with 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 12 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 3 mm ATP, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin followed by a 20-min incubation at 37 °C with RuvA (60 nm), RuvB (0.2 μm), and/or MutS (20 nm) and MutL (20 nm). Reactions were quenched and deproteinized, and the products were separated on 0.8% agarose as described. Gels were dried under vacuum followed by exposure to Kodak Biomax MR film and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 PhosphorImager. RuvAB plays an integral role in recombination and acts on intermediates formed by RecA protein (37Iwasaki H. Takahagi M. Nakata A. Shinagawa H.

The goal of this study is to investigate the ability of RuvAB to drive branch migration between closely related M13 and fd DNA in the absence and presence of MutS,L. Thus, reaction kinetics were followed in the presence of RecA and M13-M13 or M13-fd DNA with or without addition of RuvAB at different points of the reaction. M13-M13 branched intermediates formed and reached a peak level ∼10–15 min after addition of ATP, and M13-fd branched intermediates reached their highest level 40–45 min after addition of ATP (Fig. 3). RuvAB was added when branched intermediates reached their highest level. Two different branched intermediate species accumulated during the strand exchange reaction. The extent of strand exchange was evaluated by quantification of these two species. RecA-catalyzed branch migration between homologous M13 single-stranded and M13 linear duplex DNA is not subject to the energetic barrier associated with heterologous strand exchange between M13 and fd DNA (24Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3238-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 31Bianchi M.E. Radding C.M. Cell. 1983; 35: 511-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, it is expected that RuvAB does not affect M13-M13 exchange (Fig. 4). The rate at which RecA forms open circular homoduplex DNA is essentially unchanged by addition of RuvAB (Fig. 4 A, compare left and right top panels). Approximately 50% of the linear DNA was converted to branched intermediates, and ∼95% of the intermediates were converted to product after 60 min, indicating that there is little energetic barrier to DNA exchange (Fig.4 A). This corroborates the findings of Iype et al. (26Iype L.E. Wood E.A. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24967-24978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, in those experiments the ratio of RuvAB to RecA and ssDNA was ∼2.5-fold higher than in the experiments described here. Fig. 4 B shows that E. coli MutS,L do not block RecA-promoted strand exchange between homologous DNA, and the kinetic profile for formation of branched intermediates and open circular homoduplex DNA is similar in both the presence and absence of MutS,L (Fig. 4 B and as published previously (24Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3238-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 25Worth Jr., L. Bader T. Yang J. Clark S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23176-23182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)). The addition of RuvAB to RecA reactions with MutS,L had no effect on strand exchange between M13-M13 DNA (Fig. 4 B, lower panels). RecA-promoted heterologous strand exchange between M13-fd was also carried out in the presence and absence of RuvAB (Fig.5 A). Two reaction intermediates (intermediate I and intermediate II) were detected ∼15–40 min after initiation of the reaction. A third, less abundant intermediate was not detected until after 40 min (intermediate III). The kinetic profile of intermediates I and II is shown in Fig.5 A (left lower panel). The amount of intermediates I and II is similar until the reaction reaches ∼42 min. Intermediate I is constant from 42–55 min and only begins to decline during the last 10 min of the reaction. During this same time intermediate II accumulates rapidly and remains constant over the final 10 min. Intermediate III also accumulates late in the strand exchange process (50–65 min). However, less intermediate III forms than does intermediate II, and the levels of intermediate III coincide closely with the formation of full-length open circular product. The kinetics of strand exchange differ during homologous and heterologous strand exchange with M13-M13 or M13-fd DNA substrates. During homologous strand exchange, a small amount of intermediate III is observed after formation of open circular homoduplex DNA (i.e. later than 30 min). Most of intermediate I is resolved prior to the formation of product. With heterologous M13-fd substrates, product begins to accumulate before the level of intermediate I begins to decline. This result is consistent with the idea that sequence divergence acts as a barrier to strand exchange. Thus, the accumulation of intermediates I and II may be due to stalling of the branch point (11Zahrt T.C. Maloy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9786-9791Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3238-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 25Worth Jr., L. Bader T. Yang J. Clark S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23176-23182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and intermediate III might form during heterologous strand exchange due to secondary loading of RecA onto a linear duplex. As indicated above (Fig. 3), the greatest fraction of branched intermediates between M13-fd occur after 40 min in strand exchange reactions with RecA. Consequently, RuvAB was added after 42 min, and incubations were allowed to continue an additional 23 min. As shown in Fig. 5, open circular heteroduplex product is detected ∼2 min after addition of RuvAB, and a similar amount or product forms after 10 min in the absence of RuvAB. Thus, as shown previously, RuvAB stimulates the rate of heterologous strand exchange by RecA. In addition, Fig. 5 shows that the distribution of reaction intermediates is altered in the reaction to which RuvAB is added after 42 min. Intermediate II is depleted within 20 min after RuvAB is added to the reaction (Fig. 5 A). During this same time intermediate I remains at a constant level. Thus, in the presence of RuvAB, the relative amount of intermediate I increases, the relative amount of intermediate II decreases ∼3-fold, and the rate of product formation is accelerated. However, RuvAB does not increase the amount of product formed by RecA during M13-fd strand exchange. In fact, RuvAB limits uptake of substrate, because more than 50% of the linear duplex remains after incubation for 65 min. MutS,L inhibit RecA-promoted formation of open circular heteroduplex DNA between M13 and fd DNA, but MutS,L do not inhibit homologous strand exchange (Fig. 4 B and5 B) (25Worth Jr., L. Bader T. Yang J. Clark S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23176-23182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The majority of the branched molecules are intermediate I, which accumulates slightly between 40–65 min; a small amount of intermediate II is produced after 65 min. In the presence of RuvAB and MutS,L, formation of open circular heteroduplex DNA is almost completely abolished; <2% product is generated after 65 min, and the reaction kinetics are similar to a reaction with RecA and MutS,L. The relatively low level of open circular heteroduplex DNA probably reflects the small amount of intermediate II present when RuvAB was added to the reaction. Intermediate I was the only species present when RuvAB was added and is the only substrate for RuvAB. It is likely that intermediate I forms when RecA encounters DNA heterology in the presence of MutS,L, and intermediate I may persist because of an energetic barrier to strand exchange. Thus, the amount of intermediate II is reduced in the presence of MutS,L, and RuvAB has to compete with MutS,L to bind the branched molecule. To better understand the interaction between MutS,L, RecA, and RuvAB, the order and time of addition of these activities to heterologous strand exchange reactions were varied. Fig. 6 shows the kinetics of strand exchange when MutS,L were added at different time points. The level of inhibition by MutS,L is reduced almost 4-fold when these activities are added 40 min after initiation, as compared with reactions when MutS,L are present throughout the incubation. This is consistent with previous studies (24Worth L.J. Clark S. Radman M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3238-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the notion that the number of mismatched base pairs increases as heterologous strand exchange proceeds, such that the capacity of MutS,L to bind mismatches could be saturated as heteroduplex product accumulates. If this explanation is true, then it is expected that a higher amount of MutS,L could block strand exchange when added in the later phase of the reaction. As shown in Fig. 6, a 2-fold higher concentration of MutS,L blocks strand exchange when added after a 40-min reaction. The strand exchange reactions described above were carried out in the presence of RecA. Because RecA mig"

Chang L.S. Johnson L.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Transcriptional repression by p53 is likely due to protein·protein interactions with transcription factors such as TATA-binding protein (19Seto E. Usheva A. Zambetti G.P. Momand J. Horikoshi N. Weinmann R. Levine A.J. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12028-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), Sp1 (20Borellini F. Glazer R.I. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 259: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In other cases, p53 repression has been mapped to a p53-negative response element (14Wang Q. Zambetti G.P. Suttle D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most recently, histone deacetylases were implicated in transcriptional silencing of the p53 target genes,MAP4 (22Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and stathmin (23Ahn J. Murphy M. Kratowicz S. Wang A. Levine A.J. George D.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5954-5958Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), through the formation of “repression complexes” composed of the Sin3a corepressor, histone deacetylases, and p53. However, the extent to which these mechanisms of transcriptional repression by p53 can be generalized is unclear. Although one of the major roles of p53 is to stimulate apoptosis, the relationships between wild type p53 and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs are frequently complex and contradictory. A number of studies suggest that loss of wild type p53 function leads to resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy due to decreased susceptibility to apoptosis (24Lowe S.W. Bodis S. McClatchey A. Remington L. Ruley H.E. Fisher D.E. Housman D.E. Jacks T. Science. 1994; 266: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar), however, this has not always been found to be the case. For example, loss of wild type p53 has been reported to sensitize mammalian cells to taxol (25Wahl A.F. Donaldson K.L. Fairchild C. Lee F.Y. Foster S.A. Demers G.W. Galloway D.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and cisplatin (26Perego P. Giarola M. Righetti S.C. Supino R. Caserini C. Delia D. Pierotti M.A. Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Zunino F. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 556-562PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the anti-purine inhibitor, AG2034, was selectively cytotoxic toward cells with nonfunctional p53 that were lacking a functional G1 checkpoint (27Zhang C.C. Boritzki T.J. Jackson R.C. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 41: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In H35 rat hepatoma cells expressing a trans-dominant-negative p53, levels of P-glycoprotein and mdr1a transcripts were markedly elevated, resulting in resistance to P-glycoprotein substrates (16Thottassery J.V. Zambetti G.P. Arimori K. Schuetz E.G. Schuetz J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11037-11042Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Mtx sensitivity was reported to be increased in H35 cells characterized by loss of wild type p53 function (16Thottassery J.V. Zambetti G.P. Arimori K. Schuetz E.G. Schuetz J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11037-11042Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, the basis for this finding was not considered further. Mtx and related antifolates (Tomudex, 5,10-dideaza-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate) are transported into cells by the RFC (28Goldman I.D. Matherly L.H. Pharmacol. Ther. 1985; 28: 77-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 29Jansen G. Jackman A.L. Antifolate Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 293-321Crossref Google Scholar). For Mtx, RFC-mediated transport is a key element in antitumor activity, reflecting its role in generating intracellular unbound Mtx for complete inhibition of DHFR and for Mtx polyglutamate synthesis (28Goldman I.D. Matherly L.H. Pharmacol. Ther. 1985; 28: 77-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 29Jansen G. Jackman A.L. Antifolate Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 293-321Crossref Google Scholar). Given our interest in the mechanisms of transcriptional control of RFC, we began a systematic investigation to explore the possibility that wild type p53 may regulate RFC. Accordingly, we expressed wild type p53 in p53-null K562 cells under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. As described herein, in this system, wild type p53 acts as a potent repressor ofhRFC gene expression, via a mechanism that seems to be independent of its well-established effects on cell cycle progression. Rather, decreased hRFC levels and function upon p53 induction are likely due to an inactivation of transcription from the upstream hRFC-B promoter (30Zhang L. Wong S.C. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 31Tolner B. Roy K. Sirotnak F.M. Gene. 1998; 211: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Whetstine, J.

K562 human erythroleukemia cells and REH B-lymphoblastic leukemia cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). K562 and REH cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma Chemical Co.) containing 10% heat-inactivated iron-supplemented calf serum (Hyclone), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured in a 37 °C humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2/95% air. For cytotoxicity determinations, cells were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cell numbers were determined after equivalent numbers of doublings by direct microscopic counting with a hemacytometer. A commercial “Tet-on” (CLONTECH) kit was used to express wild type p53 in p53-null K562 cells under control of a tetracycline/Dox-inducible promoter (37Gossen M. Sabine F. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). The K562pTet-oncell line was developed from wild type K562 cells by transfection with the regulator pTet-on plasmid (5 μg) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.), as instructed by the manufacturer. Colonies were isolated in soft agar in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 (38Wong S.C. McQuade R. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). G418-resistant clones were expanded and screened by transient transfection with a pTRE-luc reporter plasmid. For reporter gene assays, cells were transfected with a 2.5 μg of pTRE-luc plasmid and treated with and without Dox (2 μg/ml) for 24 h, followed by additional incubation for 48 h. The cell lysates were prepared and tested for luciferase activity, as described below. To construct the pTRE/p53 plasmid, wild type p53 was cloned into a pTRE response plasmid at the BamHI site. The plasmid was then cotransfected into the K562pTet-on cell line with the pcDNA3.1/Zeo plasmid (0.25 μg, Invitrogen). Colonies were isolated in soft agar, expanded in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 and 150 μg/ml zeocin, and tested for p53 expression in the presence and absence of Dox (2 μg/ml) by Western blotting, as described below. A “double-stable” resistant clone (designated K562pTet-on/p53), which exhibited no background and a high level of Dox-induced p53 expression, was identified and used for further analysis. K562 pTRE “vector control” cells were generated by transfecting K562pTet-on cells with an empty pTRE vector. An analogous p15 “Tet-on”-inducible cell line (K562p15Tet-on-8) was prepared by transfecting p15- and p16-null K562pTet-on cells with a pTRE/p15 plasmid construct. 2S. Shah, J. Taub, T. L. Witt, J.

Soluble protein extracts were prepared by sonication in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0) containing 1% SDS and proteolytic inhibitors and subjected to SDS-PAGE (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). p53, p21, and DHFR proteins were electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes (DuPont (40Matsudaira P.

Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For hRFC protein expression, sucrose-gradient-purified plasma membranes were prepared as previously described (41Matherly L.H. Czajkowski C.A. Angeles S.M.

Aliquots (100 μg) were subjected to a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes followed by immunoblotting. hRFC proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (Lumi Light, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using protein A-purified glutathione S-transferase-hRFC antibody (43Wong S.C.

All antibody incubations were performed in Tween 20/Tris-buffered saline that was supplemented with 0.5% nonfat milk. Light emission was recorded on x-ray film with various exposure times, and the signal was quantitated on a Kodak Digital Science 440CF Image Station. Total RNAs were isolated from cells with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Equal amounts (20 μg) of total RNAs were loaded onto a 0.7% formaldehyde/agarose gel and transferred to nylon membranes (GeneScreen, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), followed by baking the membranes at 80 °C until dry. The32P-labeled probes (i.e. hRFC, p53, and p15) were prepared by random-priming (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using [α-32P]dCTP, and blots were autoradiographed after hybridization. Densitometry of autoradiographs on x-ray films was performed on the Kodak Digital Science 440CF Image Station. Equal loading of the RNAs was established by ethidium bromide staining of 28 S and 18 S RNAs or by probing with 32P-labeled GAPDH cDNA. Exponentially growing cells were treated with Dox over a range of concentrations. After 48 h of incubation, ∼1 × 107 cells were harvested for [3H]Mtx (0.5 μm) transport assays (41Matherly L.H.

Cells were incubated with [3H]Mtx at 37 °C for 180 s. The reactions were quenched with ice-cold D-PBS, and the cells were washed three times with D-PBS. The cell pellets were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.5 n NaOH. The levels of intracellular radioactivity were expressed in units of pmol/mg of protein, calculated from direct measurements of radioactivity and protein contents of the cell homogenates as determined by the method of Lowry et al. (45Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length hRFC-B (previously, Pro43; positions −2016 to −959) and the basal hRFC-B (positions −1088 to −960; numbering based on nonintron sequence relative to ATG translation start site) constructs were subcloned into pGL3-Basic plasmid (Promega) as previously described (30Zhang L.

K562pTet-on/p53 cells (∼2.5 × 106 cells per 6-well dish) were transfected with 5 μg of hRFC-B luciferase fusion gene constructs in pGL3-Basic, p53CON (5′-GGACATGCCCGGGCATGTCC-3′ (36Funk W.D. Pak D.T.

Lipofection treatments were for 24 h, followed by Dox induction and an additional incubation for 48 h in complete RPMI 1640 media containing 20% iron-supplemented calf serum. Cell lysates were assayed with a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) on a TD-2420 luminometer (Turner Designs), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The relative luciferase activity was obtained by normalizing to Renilla luciferase activity expressed from the pRL-SV40 construct. For certain experiments, cells were cotransfected with 2.5 μg of a TDN-p53 construct (16Thottassery J.V. Zambetti G.P. Arimori K. Schuetz E.G. Schuetz J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Approximately 1–2 × 106 of K562pTet-on/p53, K562p15Tet-on-8, or pTRE vector cells were harvested after treatment with and without Dox (2 μg/ml) for 48 h, washed twice with D-PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol. For DNA fluorescence staining, cells were stained in propidium iodide by the method of Crissman and Steinkamp (46Crissman H.A. Steinkamp J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 59: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and analyzed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson FACScan). Apoptosis was assayed by annexin V staining and flow cytometry using a commercial kit (R&D Systems). Total RNAs were isolated from K562pTet-on/p53 cells, treated with and without Dox, and used for the synthesis of cDNA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences RT-PCR kits). cDNAs were amplified with Taq polymerase (Promega) in the presence of GC-Rich reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and specific 5′-UTR primers and compatible coding sequence primers. Primer pairs for hRFC 5′-UTR were based on the DNA sequence for the 5′-untranslated exons (30Zhang L. Wong S.C. Matherly L.H. Biochem.

Three separate KS32 primers (designated KS32-1, -2, and -3) were employed to identify the different putative KS32 splice forms, as previously described (30Zhang L. Wong S.C. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A 194-bp fragment of the hRFC open reading frame (positions −46 to 148) was amplified as a measure of relative hRFC expression (RFC/P8, 5′-cagtgtcaccttcgtcccctccg-3′; and RFC/JW, 5′-gggtgatgaagctctcccctgg-3′). β-Actin was amplified with commercial primers (CLONTECH) as an additional control. For all primer sets, PCR conditions were: 1 cycle (95 °C for 4 min) and 32 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 67 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s). In separate control experiments, all primer sets were found to amplify from purified cDNA templates with similar efficiencies (not shown). Loss of functional wild type p53 was originally reported to lead to enhanced Mtx sensitivity in H35 rat hepatoma cells (16Thottassery J.V. Zambetti G.P. Arimori K. Schuetz E.G. Schuetz J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11037-11042Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although this was independent of changes in DHFR in this model (16Thottassery J.V. Zambetti G.P. Arimori K. Schuetz E.G. Schuetz J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11037-11042Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), it could involve any combination of other determinants of drug response (e.g. Mtx polyglutamylation, Mtx membrane transport by RFC, or levels of thymidylate synthase (28Goldman I.D. Matherly L.H. Pharmacol. Ther. 1985; 28: 77-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar)) and/or secondary effects on cell cycle progression, which manifest as decreased sensitivity to Mtx. To further explore the relationship between induction ofendogenous p53 and hRFC, we used the REH B-lymphoblastic leukemia subline, which expresses high levels of hRFC transcripts and protein, and wild type p53 (47Zhou M. Yeager A.M. Smith S.D. Findley H.W. Blood. 1995; 85: 1608-1614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). REH cells were treated with 0.5 μm daunorubicin to induce p53. p53 levels increased over time and were maximal by 6 h (Fig.1 A). Notably, hRFC transcripts also decreased in a time-dependent fashion (∼5-fold by 9 h; Fig. 1 B) and were accompanied by a similar loss of [3H]Mtx transport (not shown). However, there were no changes in the levels of transcripts for the housekeeping gene,GAPDH (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that the loss of hRFC in REH cells is comparatively specific. These data strongly suggest a suppression of hRFC levels and function by wild type p53. To better study the relationships between p53 and hRFC levels and function, we generated a double-stable transfectant (designated K562pTet-on/p53) in p53-null K562 cells, using a commercial Tet-on system (37Gossen M. Sabine F. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar) to express wild type p53 under control of a tetracycline/doxycycline-inducible promoter. We initially measured the time course induction of p53 expression following exposure to a maximum dose of Dox (2 μg/ml). In the absence of Dox, p53 was undetectable in K562pTet-on/p53 cells on Western (Fig.2 A) or Northern blots (not shown). Following Dox treatment, we found that p53 transcripts and protein were detectable as early as 6 h and that induction by Dox was maximal after 48 h of treatment. The induction of p53 protein was dose-dependent over a wide range of Dox concentrations (0.015–2 μg/ml; Fig. 2 A), and p21 expression paralleled the induction of p53 on Western blots (Fig. 2 B), indicating that p53 was transcriptionally active. At 2 μg/ml Dox, there was obvious G1 arrest with a 3-fold loss in the number of cells in S-phase (TableI) and an ∼30% decrease in growth rate (data not shown), compared with cells without Dox treatment. By annexin V staining and flow cytometry analysis, there was no detectable increase in the numbers of apoptotic cells after 48 h of Dox treatment (not shown), indicating that expression of high levels of p53 in K562pTet-on/p53 cells did not stimulate apoptosis. Collectively, our results establish the tightly regulated nature of p53 expression and downstream pathways in K562pTet-on/p53 cells treated with Dox.Table ICell cycle distribution of K562pTet-on/p53 and K562p15pTet-on-8 cellsCell linesDoxCell cycle d"
https://openalex.org/W2107167036,"The common plant regulatory factors (CPRFs) from parsley are transcription factors with a basic leucine zipper motif that bind to cis-regulatory elements frequently found in promoters of light-regulated genes. Recent studies have revealed that certain CPRF proteins are regulated in response to light by changes in their expression level and in their intracellular localization. Here, we describe an additional mechanism contributing to the light-dependent regulation of CPRF proteins. We show that the DNA binding activity of the factor CPRF4a is modulated in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and that cytosolic components are involved in the regulation of this process. Moreover, we have identified a cytosolic kinase responsible for CPRF4a phosphorylation. Modification of recombinant CPRF4a by this kinase, however, is insufficient to cause a full activation of the factor, suggesting that additional modifications are required. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the DNA binding activity of the factor is modified upon light treatment. The results of additional irradiation experiments suggest that this photoresponse is controlled by different photoreceptor systems. We discuss the possible role of CPRF4a in light signal transduction as well as the emerging regulatory network controlling CPRF activities in parsley.

We discuss the possible role of CPRF4a in light signal transduction as well as the emerging regulatory network controlling CPRF activities in parsley. basic leucine zipper motif common plant regulatory factor G-box binding factor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis electrophoretic mobility shift assay Light is probably the most important environmental stimulus for plants, controlling central developmental processes such as germination, deetiolation, and the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase (1Kendrick, R. E., and Kronenberg, G. H. M., eds. (1994) Photomorphogenesis in Plants, Kluwer, Dordrecht, NetherlandsGoogle Scholar). To monitor differences in the quality, intensity, and direction of light, plants have evolved different photoreceptor systems that control the expression of an enormous number of genes (2Batschauer A. Planta. 1998; 206: 479-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The analysis of some of these light-controlled genes has revealed several cis-acting elements that are involved in mediating light responsiveness. One of these elements, the so-called G-box, is a hexameric DNA-motif (CACGTG) that is frequently found not only in the promoters of light-regulated genes but also in promoters that respond to other environmental or endogenous stimuli, such as hormones, stress, or cell cycle-related signals (3Menkens A.E. Schindler U. Cashmore A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 506-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Screening of expression libraries with G-box probes has led to the identification of several G-box binding proteins that belong to the family of basic leucine zipper motif (bZIP)1 transcription factors, including the common plant regulatory factors (CPRFs) from parsley and the G-box binding factors (GBFs) fromArabidopsis (5Kircher S. Ledger S. Hayashi H. Weisshaar B. Schäfer E. Frohnmeyer H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Schindler U. Menkens A.E. Beckmann H. Ecker J.R. Cashmore A.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 7Menkens A.E. Cashmore A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2522-2526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bZIP motif is frequently found in eukaryotic transcription factors and mediates sequence specific DNA binding, as well the formation of either homo- or heterodimers (8Liu L. White M.J. MacRae T.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar).The results of previous studies suggest that several of the identified G-box binding proteins are involved in light signal transduction. For example, we recently reported that one member of the CPRF family, CPRF2, is exclusively localized in the cytosol in the dark and that light treatment causes an almost complete import of the factor into the nucleus (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, the factor CPRF1 is constitutively localized in the nucleus, whereas CPRF4a is found in the nucleus as well as in the cytosol under all conditions tested (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms leading to the regulation of the intracellular distribution of CPRF2 are not fully understood. However, we recently described that CPRF2 is phosphorylated in vivo in a light-dependent manner (10Wellmer F. Kircher S. Rügner A. Frohnmeyer H. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29476-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation reactions are frequently involved in the regulation of the intracellular distribution of transcription factors of yeast and animals (11Jans D.A. Hübner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 12Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of CPRF2 might play a role in triggering the nuclear import of the factor. This idea is supported by the fact that the import and the phosphorylation of CPRF2 are both strongly influenced by red light treatment, pointing to an involvement of the red light sensing phytochrome photoreceptors (10Wellmer F. Kircher S. Rügner A. Frohnmeyer H. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29476-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).In this report, we describe the role of phosphorylation in the regulation of the parsley transcription factor CPRF4a. We demonstrate that the DNA binding activity of the factor is modulated in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and that cytosolic components are involved in this process. In agreement with this result, we have identified a cytosolic CPRF4a-kinase. Phosphorylation of recombinant CPRF4a by this kinase, however, is not sufficient to cause a full activation of the factor, suggesting that additional modifications are required. Moreover, we found that light treatment of dark-grown parsley cells leads to an increased DNA binding activity of CPRF4a. This effect is accompanied by a change of the CPRF4a-specific DNA binding pattern observed in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The results of further irradiation experiments point to an involvement of different photoreceptor systems in the regulation of this process. We discuss the possible role of CPRF4a in light signal transduction, as well as the different mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of CPRF transcription factors.DISCUSSIONIn a previous report, we have studied the regulation of bZIP-like factors from parsley that are localized in the cytosol as well as in the nucleus (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here, we were able to show that these factors are identical with CPRF4a (Fig. 6). This finding allows us to integrate the previously reported data (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with the results presented in this study.We have demonstrated that the DNA binding activity of endogenous CPRF4a is affected by the kinase inhibitor H-89 as well as by two different phosphatase inhibitors (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These results implied that a kinase/phosphatase system contributes to the regulation of the factor. In agreement with this idea, the DNA binding activity of endogenous CPRF4a is strongly reduced by dephosphorylation (Figs. 4 and6 C) and the G-box binding activity of cytosolic CPRF4a after dephosphorylation can be restored in an ATP-dependent reaction (Fig. 6C). Taken together, the results presented in this study and elsewhere (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) indicate the important role of phosphorylation in the regulation of CPRF4a.As mentioned above, we were able to show that the DNA binding activity of cytosolic CPRF4a after dephosphorylation can be restored in an ATP-dependent reaction (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, in a similar experiment, the G-box binding activity of nuclear localized CPRF4a could not be restored (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These results imply that cytosolic components are necessary for the activation of the factor. The identification of a cytosolic CPRF4a-specific kinase (Fig. 2), as well as the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the DNA binding activity of CPRF4a, suggested that the kinase might directly activate the factor by changing its phosphorylation state. In accordance with this idea, we found similar effects of the kinase inhibitor H-89 on the activity of the CPRF4a-kinase (Fig. 3) and on the DNA binding activity of the factor (see above). However, compared with the nonphosphorylated factor, the DNA binding activity of recombinant CPRF4a changes only weakly after phosphorylation (Fig. 5). We conclude, therefore, that the phosphorylation of CPRF4a by the cytosolic kinase is not sufficient for a full activation of the factor and that additional modifications are therefore required. In this scenario, recombinant CPRF4a was not fully activated by ATP-containing cytosol because these additional modifications require either noncytosolic components (e.g. membrane proteins) and/or an intact cell structure. Accordingly, the ATP-dependent restoration of the DNA binding activity of cytosolic CPRF4a after dephosphorylation (Fig. 6 C) would indicate that the dephosphorylation process does not affect the additional modifications that are required for a full activation of the factor.CPRF4a contains a conserved nuclear localization sequence (5Kircher S. Ledger S. Hayashi H. Weisshaar B. Schäfer E. Frohnmeyer H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, a large pool of CPRF4a was found in the cytosol under all conditions tested (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that CPRF4a is partly retained in the cytosol by an unknown mechanism (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Intracellular distributions similar to those observed for CPRF4a have been described for the bZIP factors GBF1 from Arabidopsis and for G/HBF1 from soybean (21Terzaghi W.B. Bertekap R.L. Cashmore A.R. Plant J. 1997; 11: 967-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Dröge-Laser W. Kaiser A. Lindsay W.P. Halkier B.A. Loake G.J. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 726-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the DNA binding activities of both factors are regulated by phosphorylation. Whereas GBF1 is phosphorylated by a nuclear casein kinase II (23Klimczak L.J. Schindler U. Cashmore A.R. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24Klimczak L.J. Collinge M.A. Farini D. Giuliano G. Walker J.C. Cashmore A.R. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 105-115PubMed Google Scholar), G/HBF1 is rapidly phosphorylated in elicited soybean cells by a cytosolic kinase, leading to an enhancement of its DNA binding activity in vitro (22Dröge-Laser W. Kaiser A. Lindsay W.P. Halkier B.A. Loake G.J. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 726-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of G/HBF1 leads to a changed immunoreactivity of the factor, pointing to a major conformational change within the protein (22Dröge-Laser W. Kaiser A. Lindsay W.P. Halkier B.A. Loake G.J. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 726-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this conformational change leads to an unmasking of the nuclear localization signal of G/HBF1 allowing its nuclear import (22Dröge-Laser W. Kaiser A. Lindsay W.P. Halkier B.A. Loake G.J. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 726-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). An altered conformation might also explain the additional CPRF4a signal that appeared upon irradiation. Our results suggest that the appearance of this band is due to an increased number of factors that are bound to the tetrameric G-box probe (Fig. 6). This effect cannot be solely explained by an increase of the overall DNA binding activity of the cytosolic CPRF4a pool after irradiation because even high amounts of protein from dark-kept cytosolic extracts do not cause the formation of this band (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). An altered conformation, however, could facilitate binding to the different G-boxes of the tetrameric probe that are in close proximity by reducing steric hindrance between the factors.The appearance of the additional CPRF4a signal in cytosolic extracts is not only light-dependent but also ATP-dependent (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this effect is accompanied by an increase of the DNA binding activity of CPRF4a (Fig. 7). As a working hypothesis, we therefore suggest that the kinase/phosphatase system that is involved in controlling the DNA binding activity of CPRF4a is also involved in its light-dependent modification.Interestingly, a G-box binding pattern that is similar to that of cytosolic CPRF4a after irradiation has been observed for nuclear localized CPRF4a (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, a modification of CPRF4a might be a prerequisite for nuclear localization. Moreover, it has been demonstrated by cotranslocation assays using GBF1 antibodies that white light treatment resulted in an enhanced translocation of cytosolic bZIP-like factors to the nucleus (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because GBF1 antibodies strongly cross-react with CPRF4a,2 this result could indicate a light-induced nuclear import of CPRF4a. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that this effect is due to cross-reactions of the GBF1 antibodies with cytosolic bZIP factors others than CPRF4a. In supershift experiments, we failed to detect a major change of the cytosolic CPRF4a pool after light treatment (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, CPRF4a accumulates very rapidly upon irradiation (5Kircher S. Ledger S. Hayashi H. Weisshaar B. Schäfer E. Frohnmeyer H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This newly synthesized protein could replace those factors that are transported to the nucleus, leading to a relatively constant number of proteins in the cytosolic CPRF4a pool.The results of our irradiation experiments suggest that different photoreceptor systems contribute to the regulation of CPRF4a. The effect of red and far-red light on the DNA binding properties of CPRF4a implies the involvement of the red light sensing phytochrome photoreceptors (1Kendrick, R. E., and Kronenberg, G. H. M., eds. (1994) Photomorphogenesis in Plants, Kluwer, Dordrecht, NetherlandsGoogle Scholar, 2Batschauer A. Planta. 1998; 206: 479-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, compared with irradiation with white light, red light caused only minor effects. This result can be readily explained by the involvement of a second photoreceptor system that acts with phytochromes in an additive manner. Good candidates for such receptors are the UV-A/blue light sensing cryptochromes, which, like the phytochromes, play an important role in the development of plants (25Lin C. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 337-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by the fact that irradiation with UV and blue light causes a rapid accumulation of CPRF4a protein (5Kircher S. Ledger S. Hayashi H. Weisshaar B. Schäfer E. Frohnmeyer H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, further experiments have to be performed to confirm a role of cryptochromes in the regulation of CPRF4a.The important role of G-boxes in light-dependent gene regulation has been confirmed recently by the identification of the G-box binding factors HY5 and PIF3 from Arabidopsis(26Oyama T. Shimura Y. Okada K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2983-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 27Chattopadhyay S. Ang L.-H. Puente P. Deng X.-W. Wei N. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 28Ni M. Tepperman J.M. Quail P.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Reduced levels of these factors cause a decrease in the photoresponsiveness of their putative target genes (29Marinez-Garcia J.F. Huq E. Quail P.H. Science. 2000; 288: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been shown that these factors are not capable of inducing all light-regulated genes that contain functional G-boxes in their promoters, indicating that additional factors are required (29Marinez-Garcia J.F. Huq E. Quail P.H. Science. 2000; 288: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The results of this study suggest that CPRF4a could be such an additional G-box binding factor. A putative target gene for CPRF4a is the chalcone synthase gene from parsley that is induced by UV light. It has been recently suggested that a CPRF1-containing bZIP heterodimer is involved in the regulation of this gene (30Sprenger-Haussels M. Weisshaar B. Plant J. 2000; 22: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because CPRF4a can form heterodimers with CPRF1 (5Kircher S. Ledger S. Hayashi H. Weisshaar B. Schäfer E. Frohnmeyer H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it is a likely candidate for being the partner of CPRF1 in chalcone synthase regulation. In addition to its contribution in the formation of heterodimer complexes, CPRF4a might also compete with other G-box binding proteins (e.g. HY5 or PIF3) for binding sites and thereby may fine-tune the activities of these factors. It is remarkable that other CPRF factors that are regulated in response to light are controlled by mechanisms that are different to that of CPRF4a. For example, light treatment does not alter the DNA binding properties of CPRF2 (10Wellmer F. Kircher S. Rügner A. Frohnmeyer H. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29476-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, although CPRF2 is absent from the nucleus in the dark (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), light treatment leads to a nuclear import of the factor. These results imply that an activation of CPRF2 is achieved by its intracellular redistribution (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to CPRF4a, CPRF2 is efficiently modified in response to red light, whereas other light qualities have only minor effects (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Wellmer F. Kircher S. Rügner A. Frohnmeyer H. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29476-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These differences in light responsiveness and in the mechanisms regulating their activities suggest that CPRF2 and CPRF4a contribute to different aspects of light signal transduction and thereby act in a nonredundant manner. Light is probably the most important environmental stimulus for plants, controlling central developmental processes such as germination, deetiolation, and the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase (1Kendrick, R. E., and Kronenberg, G. H. M., eds. (1994) Photomorphogenesis in Plants, Kluwer, Dordrecht, NetherlandsGoogle Scholar). To monitor differences in the quality, intensity, and direction of light, plants have evolved different photoreceptor systems that control the expression of an enormous number of genes (2Batschauer A. Planta. 1998; 206: 479-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The analysis of some of these light-controlled genes has revealed several cis-acting elements that are involved in mediating light responsiveness. One of these elements, the so-called G-box, is a hexameric DNA-motif (CACGTG) that is frequently found not only in the promoters of light-regulated genes but also in promoters that respond to other environmental or endogenous stimuli, such as hormones, stress, or cell cycle-related signals (3Menkens A.E. Schindler U. Cashmore A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 506-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Screening of expression libraries with G-box probes has led to the identification of several G-box binding proteins that belong to the family of basic leucine zipper motif (bZIP)1 transcription factors, including the common plant regulatory factors (CPRFs) from parsley and the G-box binding factors (GBFs) fromArabidopsis (5Kircher S. Ledger S. Hayashi H. Weisshaar B. Schäfer E. Frohnmeyer H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Schindler U. Menkens A.E. Beckmann H. Ecker J.R. Cashmore A.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 7Menkens A.E. Cashmore A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2522-2526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bZIP motif is frequently found in eukaryotic transcription factors and mediates sequence specific DNA binding, as well the formation of either homo- or heterodimers (8Liu L. White M.J. MacRae T.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The results of previous studies suggest that several of the identified G-box binding proteins are involved in light signal transduction. For example, we recently reported that one member of the CPRF family, CPRF2, is exclusively localized in the cytosol in the dark and that light treatment causes an almost complete import of the factor into the nucleus (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, the factor CPRF1 is constitutively localized in the nucleus, whereas CPRF4a is found in the nucleus as well as in the cytosol under all conditions tested (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms leading to the regulation of the intracellular distribution of CPRF2 are not fully understood. However, we recently described that CPRF2 is phosphorylated in vivo in a light-dependent manner (10Wellmer F. Kircher S. Rügner A. Frohnmeyer H. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29476-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation reactions are frequently involved in the regulation of the intracellular distribution of transcription factors of yeast and animals (11Jans D.A. Hübner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 12Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of CPRF2 might play a role in triggering the nuclear import of the factor. This idea is supported by the fact that the import and the phosphorylation of CPRF2 are both strongly influenced by red light treatment, pointing to an involvement of the red light sensing phytochrome photoreceptors (10Wellmer F. Kircher S. Rügner A. Frohnmeyer H. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29476-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the role of phosphorylation in the regulation of the parsley transcription factor CPRF4a. We demonstrate that the DNA binding activity of the factor is modulated in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and that cytosolic components are involved in this process. In agreement with this result, we have identified a cytosolic CPRF4a-kinase. Phosphorylation of recombinant CPRF4a by this kinase, however, is not sufficient to cause a full activation of the factor, suggesting that additional modifications are required. Moreover, we found that light treatment of dark-grown parsley cells leads to an increased DNA binding activity of CPRF4a. This effect is accompanied by a change of the CPRF4a-specific DNA binding pattern observed in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The results of further irradiation experiments point to an involvement of different photoreceptor systems in the regulation of this process. We discuss the possible role of CPRF4a in light signal transduction, as well as the different mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of CPRF transcription factors. DISCUSSIONIn a previous report, we have studied the regulation of bZIP-like factors from parsley that are localized in the cytosol as well as in the nucleus (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here, we were able to show that these factors are identical with CPRF4a (Fig. 6). This finding allows us to integrate the previously reported data (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with the results presented in this study.We have demonstrated that the DNA binding activity of endogenous CPRF4a is affected by the kinase inhibitor H-89 as well as by two different phosphatase inhibitors (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These results implied that a kinase/phosphatase system contributes to the regulation of the factor. In agreement with this idea, the DNA binding activity of endogenous CPRF4a is strongly reduced by dephosphorylation (Figs. 4 and6 C) and the G-box binding activity of cytosolic CPRF4a after dephosphorylation can be restored in an ATP-dependent reaction (Fig. 6C). Taken together, the results presented in this study and elsewhere (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) indicate the important role of phosphorylation in the regulation of CPRF4a.As mentioned above, we were able to show that the DNA binding activity of cytosolic CPRF4a after dephosphorylation can be restored in an ATP-dependent reaction (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, in a similar experiment, the G-box binding activity of nuclear localized CPRF4a could not be restored (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These results imply that cytosolic components are necessary for the activation of the factor. The identification of a cytosolic CPRF4a-specific kinase (Fig. 2), as well as the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the DNA binding activity of CPRF4a, suggested that the kinase might directly activate the factor by changing its phosphorylation state. In accordance with this idea, we found similar effects of the kinase inhibitor H-89 on the activity of the CPRF4a-kinase (Fig. 3) and on the DNA binding activity of the factor (see above). However, compared with the nonphosphorylated factor, the DNA binding activity of recombinant CPRF4a changes only weakly after phosphorylation (Fig. 5). We conclude, therefore, that the phosphorylation of CPRF4a by the cytosolic kinase is not sufficient for a full activation of the factor and that additional modifications are therefore required. In this scenario, recombinant CPRF4a was not fully activated by ATP-containing cytosol because these additional modifications require either noncytosolic components (e.g. membrane proteins) and/or an intact cell structure. Accordingly, the ATP-dependent restoration of the DNA binding activity of cytosolic CPRF4a after dephosphorylation (Fig. 6 C) would indicate that the dephosphorylation process does not affect the additional modifications that are required for a full activation of the factor.CPRF4a contains a conserved nuclear localization sequence (5Kircher S. Ledger S. Hayashi H. Weisshaar B. Schäfer E. Frohnmeyer H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, a large pool of CPRF4a was found in the cytosol under all conditions tested (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that CPRF4a is partly retained in the cytosol by an unknown mechanism (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Intracellular distributions similar to those observed for CPRF4a have been described for the bZIP factors GBF1 from Arabidopsis and for G/HBF1 from soybean (21Terzaghi W.B. Bertekap R.L. Cashmore A.R. Plant J. 1997; 11: 967-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Dröge-Laser W. Kaiser A. Lindsay W.P. Halkier B.A. Loake G.J. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 726-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the DNA binding activities of both factors are regulated by phosphorylation. Whereas GBF1 is phosphorylated by a nuclear casein kinase II (23Klimczak L.J. Schindler U. Cashmore A.R. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24Klimczak L.J. Collinge M.A. Farini D. Giuliano G. Walker J.C. Cashmore A.R. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 105-115PubMed Google Scholar), G/HBF1 is rapidly phosphorylated in elicited soybean cells by a cytosolic kinase, leading to an enhancement of its DNA binding activity in vitro (22Dröge-Laser W. Kaiser A. Lindsay W.P. Halkier B.A. Loake G.J. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 726-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of G/HBF1 leads to a changed immunoreactivity of the factor, pointing to a major conformational change within the protein (22Dröge-Laser W. Kaiser A. Lindsay W.P. Halkier B.A. Loake G.J. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 726-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this conformational change leads to an unmasking of the nuclear localization signal of G/HBF1 allowing its nuclear import (22Dröge-Laser W. Kaiser A. Lindsay W.P. Halkier B.A. Loake G.J. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 726-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). An altered conformation might also explain the additional CPRF4a signal that appeared upon irradiation. Our results suggest that the appearance of this band is due to an increased number of factors that are bound to the tetrameric G-box probe (Fig. 6). This effect cannot be solely explained by an increase of the overall DNA binding activity of the cytosolic CPRF4a pool after irradiation because even high amounts of protein from dark-kept cytosolic extracts do not cause the formation of this band (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). An altered conformation, however, could facilitate binding to the different G-boxes of the tetrameric probe that are in close proximity by reducing steric hindrance between the factors.The appearance of the additional CPRF4a signal in cytosolic extracts is not only light-dependent but also ATP-dependent (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this effect is accompanied by an increase of the DNA binding activity of CPRF4a (Fig. 7). As a working hypothesis, we therefore suggest that the kinase/phosphatase system that is involved in controlling the DNA binding activity of CPRF4a is also involved in its light-dependent modification.Interestingly, a G-box binding pattern that is similar to that of cytosolic CPRF4a after irradiation has been observed for nuclear localized CPRF4a (13Harter K.

However, further experiments have to be performed to confirm a role of cryptochromes in the regulation of CPRF4a.The important role of G-boxes in light-dependent gene regulation has been confirmed recently by the identification of the G-box binding factors HY5 and PIF3 from Arabidopsis(26Oyama T.

Reduced levels of these factors cause a decrease in the photoresponsiveness of their putative target genes (29Marinez-Garcia J.F. Huq E. Quail P.H.

For example, light treatment does not alter the DNA binding properties of CPRF2 (10Wellmer F. Kircher S. Rügner A. Frohnmeyer H. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Biol.

This finding allows us to integrate the previously reported data (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with the results presented in this study. We have demonstrated that the DNA binding activity of endogenous CPRF4a is affected by the kinase inhibitor H-89 as well as by two different phosphatase inhibitors (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These results implied that a kinase/phosphatase system contributes to the regulation of the factor. In agreement with this idea, the DNA binding activity of endogenous CPRF4a is strongly reduced by dephosphorylation (Figs. 4 and6 C) and the G-box binding activity of cytosolic CPRF4a after dephosphorylation can be restored in an ATP-dependent reaction (Fig. 6C). Taken together, the results presented in this study and elsewhere (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) indicate the important role of phosphorylation in the regulation of CPRF4a. As mentioned above, we were able to show that the DNA binding activity of cytosolic CPRF4a after dephosphorylation can be restored in an ATP-dependent reaction (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, in a similar experiment, the G-box binding activity of nuclear localized CPRF4a could not be restored (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These results imply that cytosolic components are necessary for the activation of the factor. The identification of a cytosolic CPRF4a-specific kinase (Fig. 2), as well as the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the DNA binding activity of CPRF4a, suggested that the kinase might directly activate the factor by changing its phosphorylation state. In accordance with this idea, we found similar effects of the kinase inhibitor H-89 on the activity of the CPRF4a-kinase (Fig. 3) and on the DNA binding activity of the factor (see above). However, compared with the nonphosphorylated factor, the DNA binding activity of recombinant CPRF4a changes only weakly after phosphorylation (Fig. 5). We conclude, therefore, that the phosphorylation of CPRF4a by the cytosolic kinase is not sufficient for a full activation of the factor and that additional modifications are therefore required. In this scenario, recombinant CPRF4a was not fully activated by ATP-containing cytosol because these additional modifications require either noncytosolic components (e.g. membrane proteins) and/or an intact cell structure. Accordingly, the ATP-dependent restoration of the DNA binding activity of cytosolic CPRF4a after dephosphorylation (Fig. 6 C) would indicate that the dephosphorylation process does not affect the additional modifications that are required for a full activation of the factor. CPRF4a contains a conserved nuclear localization sequence (5Kircher S. Ledger S. Hayashi H. Weisshaar B. Schäfer E. Frohnmeyer H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, a large pool of CPRF4a was found in the cytosol under all conditions tested (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that CPRF4a is partly retained in the cytosol by an unknown mechanism (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Intracellular distributions similar to those observed for CPRF4a have been described for the bZIP factors GBF1 from Arabidopsis and for G/HBF1 from soybean (21Terzaghi W.B. Bertekap R.L. Cashmore A.R. Plant J. 1997; 11: 967-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Dröge-Laser W. Kaiser A. Lindsay W.P. Halkier B.A. Loake G.J. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 726-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the DNA binding activities of both factors are regulated by phosphorylation. Whereas GBF1 is phosphorylated by a nuclear casein kinase II (23Klimczak L.J. Schindler U. Cashmore A.R. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24Klimczak L.J. Collinge M.A. Farini D. Giuliano G. Walker J.C. Cashmore A.R. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 105-115PubMed Google Scholar), G/HBF1 is rapidly phosphorylated in elicited soybean cells by a cytosolic kinase, leading to an enhancement of its DNA binding activity in vitro (22Dröge-Laser W. Kaiser A. Lindsay W.P. Halkier B.A. Loake G.J. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 726-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of G/HBF1 leads to a changed immunoreactivity of the factor, pointing to a major conformational change within the protein (22Dröge-Laser W. Kaiser A. Lindsay W.P. Halkier B.A. Loake G.J. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 726-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this conformational change leads to an unmasking of the nuclear localization signal of G/HBF1 allowing its nuclear import (22Dröge-Laser W. Kaiser A. Lindsay W.P. Halkier B.A. Loake G.J. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 726-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). An altered conformation might also explain the additional CPRF4a signal that appeared upon irradiation. Our results suggest that the appearance of this band is due to an increased number of factors that are bound to the tetrameric G-box probe (Fig. 6). This effect cannot be solely explained by an increase of the overall DNA binding activity of the cytosolic CPRF4a pool after irradiation because even high amounts of protein from dark-kept cytosolic extracts do not cause the formation of this band (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). An altered conformation, however, could facilitate binding to the different G-boxes of the tetrameric probe that are in close proximity by reducing steric hindrance between the factors. The appearance of the additional CPRF4a signal in cytosolic extracts is not only light-dependent but also ATP-dependent (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this effect is accompanied by an increase of the DNA binding activity of CPRF4a (Fig. 7). As a working hypothesis, we therefore suggest that the kinase/phosphatase system that is involved in controlling the DNA binding activity of CPRF4a is also involved in its light-dependent modification. Interestingly, a G-box binding pattern that is similar to that of cytosolic CPRF4a after irradiation has been observed for nuclear localized CPRF4a (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, a modification of CPRF4a might be a prerequisite for nuclear localization. Moreover, it has been demonstrated by cotranslocation assays using GBF1 antibodies that white light treatment resulted in an enhanced translocation of cytosolic bZIP-like factors to the nucleus (13Harter K. Kircher S. Frohnmeyer H. Krenz M. Nagy F. Schäfer E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 545-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because GBF1 antibodies strongly cross-react with CPRF4a,2 this result could indicate a light-induced nuclear import of CPRF4a. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that this effect is due to cross-reactions of the GBF1 antibodies with cytosolic bZIP factors others than CPRF4a. In supershift experiments, we failed to detect a major change of the cytosolic CPRF4a pool after light treatment (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, CPRF4a accumulates very rapidly upon irradiation (5Kircher S. Ledger S. Hayashi H. Weisshaar B. Schäfer E. Frohnmeyer H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This newly synthesized protein could replace those factors that are transported to the nucleus, leading to a relatively constant number of proteins in the cytosolic CPRF4a pool. The results of our irradiation experiments suggest that different photoreceptor systems contribute to the regulation of CPRF4a. The effect of red and far-red light on the DNA binding properties of CPRF4a implies the involvement of the red light sensing phytochrome photoreceptors (1Kendrick, R. E., and Kronenberg, G. H. M., eds. (1994) Photomorphogenesis in Plants, Kluwer, Dordrecht, NetherlandsGoogle Scholar, 2Batschauer A. Planta. 1998; 206: 479-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, compared with irradiation with white light, red light caused only minor effects. This result can be readily explained by the involvement of a second photoreceptor system that acts with phytochromes in an additive manner. Good candidates for such receptors are the UV-A/blue light sensing cryptochromes, which, like the phytochromes, play an important role in the development of plants (25Lin C. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 337-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by the fact that irradiation with UV and blue light causes a rapid accumulation of CPRF4a protein (5Kircher S. Ledger S. Hayashi H. Weisshaar B. Schäfer E. Frohnmeyer H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, further experiments have to be performed to confirm a role of cryptochromes in the regulation of CPRF4a. The important role of G-boxes in light-dependent gene regulation has been confirmed recently by the identification of the G-box binding factors HY5 and PIF3 from Arabidopsis(26Oyama T. Shimura Y. Okada K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2983-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 27Chattopadhyay S. Ang L.-H. Puente P. Deng X.-W. Wei N. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 28Ni M. Tepperman J.M. Quail P.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Reduced levels of these factors cause a decrease in the photoresponsiveness of their putative target genes (29Marinez-Garcia J.F. Huq E. Quail P.H. Science. 2000; 288: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been shown that these factors are not capable of inducing all light-regulated genes that contain functional G-boxes in their promoters, indicating that additional factors are required (29Marinez-Garcia J.F. Huq E. Quail P.H. Science. 2000; 288: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The results of this study suggest that CPRF4a could be such an additional G-box binding factor. A putative target gene for CPRF4a is the chalcone synthase gene from parsley that is induced by UV light. It has been recently suggested that a CPRF1-containing bZIP heterodimer is involved in the regulation of this gene (30Sprenger-Haussels M. Weisshaar B. Plant J. 2000; 22: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because CPRF4a can form heterodimers with CPRF1 (5Kircher S. Ledger S. Hayashi H. Weisshaar B. Schäfer E. Frohnmeyer H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it is a likely candidate for being the partner of CPRF1 in chalcone synthase regulation. In addition to its contribution in the formation of heterodimer complexes, CPRF4a might also compete with other G-box binding proteins (e.g. HY5 or PIF3) for binding sites and thereby may fine-tune the activities of these factors. It is remarkable that other CPRF factors that are regulated in response to light are controlled by mechanisms that are different to that of CPRF4a. For example, light treatment does not alter the DNA binding properties of CPRF2 (10Wellmer F. Kircher S. Rügner A. Frohnmeyer H. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29476-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, although CPRF2 is absent from the nucleus in the dark (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), light treatment leads to a nuclear import of the factor. These results imply that an activation of CPRF2 is achieved by its intracellular redistribution (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to CPRF4a, CPRF2 is efficiently modified in response to red light, whereas other light qualities have only minor effects (9Kircher S. Wellmer F. Nick P. Rügner A. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Wellmer F. Kircher S. Rügner A. Frohnmeyer H. Schäfer E. Harter K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29476-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These differences in light responsiveness and in the mechanisms regulating their activities suggest that CPRF2 and CPRF4a contribute to different aspects of light signal transduction and thereby act in a nonredundant manner."
https://openalex.org/W2069044554,"The Kdp-ATPase of Escherichia coli is a four-subunit P-type ATPase that accumulates K+ with high affinity and specificity. Residues clustered in four regions of the KdpA subunit of Kdp were implicated as critical for K+binding from the analysis of mutants with reduced affinity for K+ (Buurman, E., Kim, K.-T., and Epstein, W. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 6678–6685). K+binding by this pump has been analyzed in detail by site-directed mutagenesis. We have examined 83 of the 557 residues in KdpA, from 11 to 34 residues in each of four binding clusters known to affect K+ binding. Amber mutations were constructed in a plasmid carrying the kdpFABC structural genes. Transferring these plasmids to 12 suppressor strains, each inserting a different amino acid at amber codons, created 12 different substitutions at the mutated sites. This study delineates the four clusters and confirms that they are important for K+ affinity but have little effect on the rate of transport. At only 21 of the residues studied did at least three substitutions alter affinity for K+, an indication that a residue is in or very near a K+ binding site. At many residues lysine was the only substitution that altered its affinity. The effect of lysine is most likely a repulsive effect of this cationic residue on K+ and thus reflects the effective distance between a residue and the site of binding or passage of K+ in KdpA. Once a crystallographic structure of Kdp is available, this measure of effective distance will help identify the path of K+ as it moves through the KdpA subunit to cross the membrane. The Kdp-ATPase of Escherichia coli is a four-subunit P-type ATPase that accumulates K+ with high affinity and specificity. Residues clustered in four regions of the KdpA subunit of Kdp were implicated as critical for K+binding from the analysis of mutants with reduced affinity for K+ (Buurman, E., Kim, K.-T., and Epstein, W.

Once a crystallographic structure of Kdp is available, this measure of effective distance will help identify the path of K+ as it moves through the KdpA subunit to cross the membrane. The high specificity of transport systems is believed to be governed by the structures of the sites where the transported substrate binds, just as substrate binding sites account for much of the specificity of enzymes. The large numbers of enzymes whose high resolution crystallographic structures and hence substrate binding sites are well known contrasts dramatically with the limited structural information available for integral membrane proteins. Instead, details related to substrate-binding sites have been inferred from mutations and from covalent modifications that alter transport or from the ability of substrates to block such covalent modification. These methods allow for the identification of residues involved in substrate binding. In this work, a genetic approach was used to analyze substrate binding by Kdp, a P-type ATPase in Escherichia coli and many other bacteria. Kdp consists of three large protein subunits: KdpA, 59 kDa; KdpB, 72 kDa; KdpC, 20 kDa; and the KdpF peptide, 3.2 kDa (1Altendorf K. Epstein W. Lee A.G. Biomembranes: ATPases. 5. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1996: 403-420Google Scholar, 2Altendorf K. Gassel M. Puppe W. Moellenkamp T. Zeck A. Boddien C. Fendler K. Bamberg E. Droese S. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 163 (Suppl. 643): 137-146Google Scholar). All but KdpF are required for transport. The KdpB subunit is the site of acylphosphorylation and is homologous to the large subunit of other P-type ATPases. KdpA and KdpC have no homologs other than Kdp genes in other bacteria. E. coli has four distinct K+transport systems: three saturable systems now referred to as Kdp, Trk (formerly TrkA or TrkG/TrkH), and Kup (formerly TrkD), and a low rate nonsaturable activity referred to as TrkF (3Rhoads D.B. Waters F.B. Epstein W. J. Gen Physiol. 1976; 67: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Recent work strongly suggests that TrkF activity is illicit transport of K+through a variety of other transport systems. 1E. T. Buurman, D. McLaggan, J. Naprstek, and W. Epstein, unpublished observations. In this study of Kdp, we have used mutants in which the other two saturable systems, Trk and Kup, are absent so the only activity besides Kdp is the low rate TrkF system. Residues involved in binding of K+ were previously identified from the analysis of mutants in which theKm for K+ had increased from the wild type value of about 2 μm to values from 0.2 to 90 mm (4Buurman E. Kim K.-T. Epstein W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6678-6685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Of the 36 mutants analyzed, 32 altered the KdpA subunit and retained high rates of transport with marked reductions in K+ affinity. The 32 mutants that altered KdpA represent 15 different mutations of 13 residues. These residues are in four clusters widely distributed in KdpA (Fig. 1). Clusters I, II, and IV were predicted by topologic analysis to face the periplasm, where they can form an initial K+-binding site. Cluster III, predicted to begin within a membrane span and extend into a rather hydrophobic cytoplasmic region of KdpA, may be the site where cations are occluded in the process of transport. Cation occlusion has been demonstrated for several other P-type ATPases but not yet for Kdp (5Beauge L.A. Glynn I.M. Nature. 1979; 280: 510-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 6Dupont Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Rabon E.C. Smillie K. Seru V. Rabon R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8012-8018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the four clusters was previously identified by only two to four residues, providing little information about the size of each cluster or which residues within a cluster were important for binding. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed 83 of the 557 residues in KdpA to identify those that are critical for substrate binding. To test comprehensively the importance of each residue, we examined at least 11 substitutions at each residue using the amber suppression technique (8Kleina L.G. Miller J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar,9Miller J.H. Coulondre C. Hofer M. Schmeissner U. Sommer H. Schmitz A. Lu P. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 191-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This technique creates up to 12 amino acid substitutions at an introduced amber stop codon. The results 1) confirm that each of the four clusters is critical in determining substrate binding; 2) better define the size of each cluster; and 3) highlight the unique effect of cationic substitutions in this high affinity cation transport system. The strain used in this work, TK2474 (F− thi nagA argEamlacZam Δ(kdpFAB)5 trkD1 trkA405) is defective for all saturable K+ transport systems, making it possible to score for the properties of the Kdp system expressed from a plasmid by growth tests (10Polarek J.W. Walderhaug M.O. Epstein W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 705-717Google Scholar). TheargEam mutation was introduced to select for and maintain the presence of an amber suppressor. A streptomycin-resistant (rpsL) derivative of TK2474, strain TK2497 made by transduction, served to examine the basis of weak suppression of some amber mutations by strain TK2474. The amber suppressing strains utilized are all derivatives of TK2474 carrying either a chromosomally encoded or a plasmid-encoded suppressor tRNA. Twelve strains, each carrying a different amber suppressor tRNA gene, were obtained as the Interchange Kit (Promega). The chromosomally encoded suppressors, supD, supE, supF,supG, and supP, were introduced into strain TK2474 by transduction, using P1 lysates made from the strains provided in the Interchange kit. Four of the suppressors also suppressed the amber lac mutation in the strain. Failure to do so bysupG suggests that Lys is not an acceptable substitution at the site of the lac mutation. The plasmid carrying the kdp genes has a colE1 replication origin and therefore is incompatible with the plasmid-borne suppressors in the interchange kit, which have the same replication origin. We therefore transferred the suppressors to a derivative of the p15 origin plasmid, pACYC184, which is compatible with pBR322. Included in the interchange kit was a pACYC184 derivative in which the gene encoding chloramphenicol transacetylase has an amber mutation. This plasmid was digested with the EcoRI and HindIII restriction enzymes, the ends were made blunt with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and then the PvuII restriction fragment of the suppressor plasmids (the fragment comprising the suppressor tRNA gene and its promoter) was inserted. The resulting plasmid carries the suppressor and lacks the tet gene, which mediates a low rate of K+ uptake that would have confounded accurate scoring (11Dosch D.C. Savacion F.F. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only six of the seven plasmid-borne suppressors in the interchange kit were functional. No functional Arg-inserting suppressor could be obtained because all constructs screened had multiple sequence alterations in the suppressor tRNA sequence. Instead, we used an Ala-inserting suppressor obtained from Jeffrey Miller. The plasmid carrying the wild typekdpFABC operon used for mutagenesis, pSD104, is a derivative of pBR322 from which most of the tet gene has been deleted, a f1 origin has been inserted, and kdp sequences beginning just upstream of the promoter of the kdpFABC operon and ending about 500 base pairs past the end of the kdpC gene are present. Thekdp genes in this construct are under physiological regulation, requiring the KdpD and KdpE regulatory proteins as well as a signal to express Kdp, which is believed to be a reduction in turgor pressure (12Laimins L.A. Rhoads D.B. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The kdpFAB5 deletion in host strain TK2474 ends near the border of the kdpB and kdpC genes and expresses the intact kdpD and kdpE genes (13Epstein W. Davies M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 836-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complex KML medium and minimal medium have been described (14Epstein W. Kim B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 639-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 0 mm K+ medium has no added K+ and generally contains about 20 μm K+ because of contamination of the sodium phosphates. The carbon and energy source in minimal medium was glucose, 0.2% in liquid cultures and 0.5–1% in solid medium. Ticarcillin, a stable penicillin, was used at 100 μg/ml, chloramphenicol at 15 μg/ml, and streptomycin sulfate at 200 μg/ml. Growth was at 37 °C except for transport experiments, for which cells were grown at 30 °C. Transductions with bacteriophage P1 and transformations were performed as described (14Epstein W. Kim B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 108: 639-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 74-84Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the method of Kunkel (16Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) on single-stranded DNA. Plasmid pSD104 was transformed into F′ ung dut strain CJ236, and single-stranded copies in phage coats were obtained by infecting with replication-impaired M13K07 helper phage (17Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). Mutant plasmids were created by using mutagenic primers of 23 bases in which the amber codon (TAG) is flanked by 10 wild type nucleotides on each side, T4 DNA polymerase and T4 ligase. The resulting plasmids were transformed into TK2474 with selection for resistance to ticarcillin. Mutagenesis efficiency was extremely variable in this work. Between 5 and 60% of the clones obtained were unable to grow on medium containing 1 mm K+. Putative mutants were screened by transformation into the set of TK2474 derivatives each carrying a different suppressor. Amber mutations were not introduced at six residues where mutagenesis failed on three independent attempts. Arg substitutions were made directly, starting with a plasmid already carrying an amber mutation at the residue to be mutated. The resulting constructs with the CGG codon for Arg were screened for growth properties under the expectation that they would resemble those of Lys substitutions. DNA sequence analysis showed that all 10 had the correct sequence. DNA sequencing was performed by the automated dye termination method with Applied Bioscience model 377 instruments. All colonies were tested by growth on solid medium. Master plates on which each mutant was either in the nonsuppressing parent or one of the suppressing strains were made on 115 and 1 mm K+ plates. These were replica plated, the former to 3, 5, and 10 mmK+ plates and the latter to 0, 0.1, and 0.3 mmK+ plates (scoring growth on 0 mmK+ would be unreliable using only the 115 mmK+ master plate, because there is some transfer of K+ in the process of replica plating). Growth was scored as positive if there was visible growth after 20 h of incubation at 37 °C. Kinetics of K+ uptake were measured by the rate of net increase in cell K+ produced by osmotic upshock (18Rhoads D.B. Epstein W. J. Gen.

Kdp was induced by growing cells in medium of a K+ concentration at which growth was 70% or less of the rate in high K+ medium (12Laimins L.A. Rhoads D.B. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Cells were centrifuged and transferred to 70 mmNaPO4 buffer (pH 7.1) containing 0.1% (w/v) glucose at a concentration of about 1.4 × 109 cells/ml. K+ uptake was produced by diluting 1 part cell suspension with 2 parts of buffer containing 0.5 m glucose and a mixture of K+ and Na-PO4 buffers to achieve the desired final K+ concentration. Good aeration was maintained by vigorous shaking. Where growth data indicated high affinity, uptake was measured at only two concentrations, 30 μm and either 2 or 5 mm. Where affinity was not high, uptake was measured at three well spaced K+concentrations in an attempt to bracket the Kmvalue. Collection and analysis of cell samples for measurement of K+ uptake and expression of the values per unit dry weight based on turbidity measurements have been described (3Rhoads D.B. Waters F.B. Epstein W. J. Gen Physiol. 1976; 67: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Initial rates of uptake were based on a visual best fit to the early part of the uptake curves, which were linear for at least 3 min. Kinetics of K+ uptake for the two strains tested that grew in 5 mm K+ medium in the absence of a suppressor and the Lys replacement at residue 110 were performed after K+depletion to increase accuracy in measuring the low rate of uptake in these strains. Kinetics in all cases are based on transport data after correction for the contribution of TrkF activity (3Rhoads D.B. Waters F.B. Epstein W. J. Gen Physiol. 1976; 67: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences were downloaded from GenBankTM, translated into protein sequences, and aligned using the Clustal method (DNASTAR software package). Accession numbers are K02670 (E. coli), AL123456(Mycobacterium tuberculosis), AL078610 (Streptomyces coelicolor), U44892 (Clostridium acetobutylicum),AJ243194 (Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius), AB001339(Synechocystis PCC6803), and AF213466 (unidentifiedAnabaena species). This system allows large scale and rapid phenotypic screening of a large number of changes at each amino acid residue. Identification of amber mutations can be done without DNA sequence analysis by simple growth tests in suppressing or nonsuppressing strains. For this study, we made amber mutations in 83 of the 557 amino acid residues of KdpA: 11 residues in cluster I, 25 in cluster II, 34 in cluster III, and 13 in cluster IV. Although suppression confirms the presence of these amber mutations, adjacent residues might also have been altered. To determine the frequency of such an event, the 21 amber mutations marked by footnotec in Table I were subjected to DNA sequencing of ∼400 base pairs spanning the site of the mutation. All sequenced constructs had the expected amber mutation and no other change.Table IGrowth screening of suppressed amber substitutionsCLUSTER IInserted amino

Each combination of mutation and suppressor was tested for growth on solid medium containing a range of K+ concentrations. Rapid growth of these strains in medium with K+ below about 20 mm depends on Kdp activity. Kdp activity is essential for visible growth below 12–15 mm K+. A summary of the results of screening substitutions by growth is presented in Fig.2. The height of each column indicates the number of substitutions affecting K+ binding. Effects of Lys substitutions on binding, a unique result of this study, are indicated by shaded boxes. The specific results summarized in Fig. 2 are based on detailed data shown in the Table I. Numeric entries in the Table I indicate the lowest K+ concentration on which the strain could grow; no entry in the table means that substitution restored the wild type phenotype (i.e. growth on 0 mm K+ medium). The criterion we have chosen to implicate residues in a binding site is a change in affinity by three or more different amino acid substitutions. Even subtle changes in a binding site should have significant effects on binding. By this criterion 21 of the residues studied are in binding sites: 113, 114, and 116 in cluster I, 220, 224, 231, 232, 233 in cluster II, 339, 340, 343, 348, 352, 354, and 355 in cluster III, and 461, 464, 469, and 471 in cluster IV. Six of these residues, 114, 231, 232, 352, 461, and 469, had been previously identified as sites of affinity mutations (4Buurman E. Kim K.-T. Epstein W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6678-6685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Only one of the residues tested was fastidious in its requirements; at residue 232 only Phe in addition to the restoration of the normal Gly by one of the suppressors resulted in wild type growth. The Lys substitution altered affinity at over 70% of the sites tested. At many sites, it was the only residue that did so. This effect appears to be due to its positive charge, because anionic, large neutral polar, and large hydrophobic residues were generally well tolerated at these residues. To confirm the effects of introducing a positive charge, we constructed Arg substitutions at 10 residues in clusters I and II (Table II). The results showed that Arg can be as disruptive as Lys. However, the effect of these two substitutions were somewhat different in that at some sites only one or the other abolished wild type growth. His tended to be disruptive at sites where Lys was disruptive (Table I).Table IIGrowth screening of arginine substitutionsInserted amino acidVal110Thr111Thr113Trp115Gln116Ser117Ser119Met227Leu228Gly229His00000.100000.1Arg001050.100303Lys0.10.153100.100.110Entries indicate lowest K+ concentration (mm) at which growth was observed. Open table in a new tab Entries indicate lowest K+ concentration (mm) at which growth was observed. At 53 of the 83 sites, one of the suppressors inserted the wild type residue. This resulted in wild type growth in all cases, shown by a + in Table I, providing a positive control. In seven cases, suppression created a mutation studied earlier (4Buurman E. Kim K.-T. Epstein W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6678-6685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and all of these substitutions had reduced affinity. In several cases the quantitative K+ requirement listed in Table Idiffers from that reported previously. These differences can be attributed to the different way growth dependence on K+concentration was quantified in this work and the effects of variable suppression at amber mutations. For negative controls we placed the construct in nonsuppressing hosts. The phenotype was no growth except in 115 mm K+medium. This phenotype was observed at most sites, but in several instances, growth persisted in 10 mm or even 5 mm K+ medium. This result suggested that amber mutations at some sites were weakly suppressed even in the absence of a known suppressor. Accordingly, we tested these in the rpsLmutant strain, TK2497, because rpsL mutations are known to increase ribosomal fidelity and hence reduce improper readthrough (19Strigini P. Gorini L. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 47: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). At most sites, growth on 10 mm K+ no longer occurred in transformants of rpsL strain TK2497 where it had occurred in strain TK2474. However, growth in 5–10 mmK+ persisted at 11 sites (Table I). To determine the basis for growth in 5 and 10 mmK+ in the absence of a known suppressor, we determined the kinetics of K+ uptake in two mutants, those at residues 344 and 464 in strain TK2299 (identical to TK2474 except that it is Arg+). The presence of the wild type rpsL locus in strain TK2299 should make it easier to detect leakiness than in therpsL mutant strain TK2497. Each mutant mediated only a very low rate of uptake at low K+ concentrations. After correcting for the contribution of the TrkF system, the results are consistent with a saturable component with aVmax of about 0.5 μmol g−1protein min−1 and a Km less than 0.5 mm. Growth in 5 mm K+ medium is therefore consistent with slight leakiness of the amber mutations at these loci. Several examples of how partial impairment of Kdp activity affects rates of transport, and thereby growth, are diagrammed in Fig. 3. In the strains used here, Kdp is the only saturable K+ uptake system, but the nonsaturable TrkF activity is present (3Rhoads D.B. Waters F.B. Epstein W. J. Gen Physiol. 1976; 67: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). When there is no Kdp activity (shown by curve A in Fig. 3), growth will only occur at K+ concentrations well above 10 mm. Kdp activity with wild type affinity but only 3% of the usual rate (shown by curve B in Fig. 3) is sufficient to allow growth at all K+ concentrations and hence to score as wild type. Thus, a reduction in rate of up to 97% with retention of normal affinity will not appea"

AF009781 hemopoietic stem cell embryonal stem embryoid body polymerase chain reaction leukemia inhibitory factor The hemopoietic stem cell (HSC)1 occupies a pivotal position within the hemopoietic hierarchy and it is at this cellular level that all hemopoietic function is ultimately regulated (1Graham G.J. Wright E.G. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1997; 78: 197-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is also at this level that dysfunctions involved in the pathogenesis of leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders frequently arise (2Bonnet D. Dick J.E. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (5345) Google Scholar). For these reasons, it is clear that a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating the generation and function of hemopoietic stem cells is central to our appreciation of physiological and pathological stem cell function. Unfortunately, a number of practical limitations associated with studies on adult HSC have precluded in depth analyses of genes of relevance to stem cell function. Foremost among these difficulties is the problem of purifying homogenous populations of stem cells for molecular analysis. To alleviate the problems associated with studies on adult HSC, we have recently turned our attention to the murine in vitroembryonal stem (ES) cell system and have been attempting to develop this as a tractable model of stem cell generation and function that may be more amenable to in depth molecular analyses. Embryonal stem cells are totipotent cells derived from the murine blastocyst at 3.5 days post-coitum and are maintained in an undifferentiated state by in vitro culture in the presence of the differentiation inhibiting agent leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (3Robertson E.J.

Upon removal of the LIF, ES cells when cultured as aggregates, or embryoid bodies (EBs) will spontaneously commit in vitro to a range of embryological tissues including epidermis (6Bagutti C. Wobus A.M. Fassler R. Watt F.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 184-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), neuronal and glial cells (7Fraichard A. Chassande O. Bilbaut G. Dehay C. Savatoer P. Samarut J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3181-3188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), muscle cells (8Maltsev V.A. Wobus A.M. Rohwedel J. Bader M. Hescheler J. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), and most notably hemopoietic cells (9Doetschman T.C. Eisetter H. Katz M. Schmidt W. Kemler R. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1985; 87: 27-45PubMed Google Scholar). Hemopoiesis in differentiated EBs is typically represented by regions of hemoglobinization which are referred to as blood islands and which are composed principally of erythrocytes with small numbers of macrophages (9Doetschman T.C. Eisetter H. Katz M. Schmidt W. Kemler R. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1985; 87: 27-45PubMed Google Scholar). This hemopoietic cell generation occurs in the absence of exogenous growth factors, however, addition of appropriate hemopoietic growth factors or use of supportive stromal cells during the differentiation process can lead to the generation of progenitor cells for all hemopoietic lineages in the developed embryoid body (10Burkert U. Von Ruden T. Wagner E.F. The New Biologist. 1991; 3: 698-708PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wiles M.V. Keller G. Development. 1991; 111: 259-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gutierrez-Ramos J.C.

This therefore suggests that at some point between being an ES cell with no direct hemopoietic potential and being a developed EB with the capacity to contain progenitors for all of the hemopoietic lineages, some of the ES cells within an EB must commit to the hemopoietic system, i.e. they must become hemopoietic stem cells. Indeed a number of studies has demonstrated the presence of cells at various stages of hemopoietic development, from hemangioblasts to primitive long-term and short-term repopulating stem cells as well as committed progenitors of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages, in the developing EBs (12Gutierrez-Ramos J.C.

We have used a range of in vitro and in vivoassays to demonstrate a reproducible temporal pattern of emergence of long-term repopulating and short-term repopulating HSC in EBs post-LIF removal in vitro. Thus, while at day 3 post-initiation of differentiation no HSCs are detectable in the developing EBs, by day 4 long-term repopulating stem cells, and by day 5 short-term repopulating stem cells are detectable (19Hole N. Graham G.J. Menzel U. Ansell J.D. Blood. 1996; 88: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This stem cell generation requires no exogenous growth factors and precedes the emergence of mature hemopoietic cells or blood islands. The reproducible time frame of HSC emergence in this in vitro system and the ease of generation of large numbers of EB-derived cells has prompted us to examine the usefulness of the day 3/day 5 time frame as a source of known and novel hemopoietic gene products. We now report the characterization of a subtracted library generated using cDNA from day 3 and day 5 embryoid bodies. Our results suggest that of the identifiable cDNAs within the subtracted library, ∼46% are predominantly associated with hemopoietic or hemopoietic supportive cells confirming the usefulness of the ES cell system as a source of known hemopoietic gene products. Characterization of a novel membrane encoding cDNA from the subtracted library has further emphasized the value of this system as a source of novel genes of relevance to hemopoiesis. In addition, analysis of the hemopoietic genes identified in the subtracted library is indicative of erythroid pre-conditioning of the primitive hemopoietic stem cell. The EFC-1 ES cell line was routinely passaged and maintained in an undifferentiated state as described previously (19Hole N. Graham G.J. Menzel U. Ansell J.D. Blood. 1996; 88: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Hole N. Smith A.G. Freshney R.I. Pragnell I.B. Freshney M.G. Culture of Hematopoietic Cells. Wiley-Liss, New York1994: 235-249Google Scholar). EBs were generated by hanging drop culture of 10 μl of ES cells at a concentration of 3 × 104/ml in the presence of LIF in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 2 days, the EBs were harvested into a Petri dish, washed clear of the LIF, and differentiation allowed to proceed in LIF-depleted medium at a concentration of 103 EBs/10-ml culture medium. At days 3 and 5 post-differentiation initiation, EBs were harvested and the presence of HSCs determined using the CFU-A assay as previously described (19Hole N. Graham G.J. Menzel U. Ansell J.D. Blood. 1996; 88: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining EBs were processed for mRNA and cDNA generation as described below. Large scale differentiation of EBs was carried out on a number of occasions until high level CFU-A generation was achieved between days 3 and 5 post-initiation of differentiation. EBs from this experiment were harvested and mRNA produced using a Stratagene Messenger RNA isolation kit. Aliquots (5 μg) of the mRNA samples were used to generate day 3 and day 5 full-length cDNA libraries in ZAP Express (Stratagene) according to manufacturers instructions. Subtractive hybridization was performed according to the method of Wang and Brown (21Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) which involves the use of alternative linkers on the driver and tracer cDNA populations thus minimizing driver cDNA carry-over which may complicate the analysis of the subtracted library. Briefly this method involved the preparation of mRNA from day 3 and day 5 EBs which was then converted to double-stranded cDNA using the Invitrogen Copy Kit. cDNA from the day 3 and day 5 EBs was then digested separately withAluI and with a mixture of AluI andRsaI and these two digests pooled for each time point. Both enzymes are “blunt end” cutters and have a four-base recognition site resulting in a reduction of the average size of the cDNA population to around 500 base pairs. At this stage, double-stranded linkers were generated according to the method of Balzer and Baumlein (22Balzer H.J. Baumlein H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used to generate these linkers were: (a) 5′-TAGTCCGAATTCAAGCAAGAGCACA-3′; (b) 5′-CTCTTGCTTGAATTCGGACTA-3′; (c) 5′-AGCCATTCTAGACGTGTAACTGATA-3′; (d) 5′-AGTTACACGTCTAGAATGGCT-3′. Oligonucleotides a, b, c, and d were phosphorylated and ab and cd pairs allowed to anneal to form double-stranded linkers. These linkers were ligated onto either the digested day 3 EB cDNA (ab linker pairing) or the day 5 EB-digested cDNA (cd linker pairing). These linkers serve both as PCR primer recognition site for amplification of the cDNA populations but also as restriction enzyme sites for cleaving prior to cloning into sequencing vectors, Thus, and as underlined above, the ab linker pairing is cleavable withEcoRI and the cd paring with XbaI. The linker ligated on day 3 and day 5 cDNA populations were separated from residual linkers and size fractionated on a 1.4% low melting point agarose gel. From this gel a slice corresponding to a size range of 200 base pairs to 2 kilobase pairs was cut out for the day 3 and day 5 cDNA populations. These low melting point-agarose cDNA preparations were used as templates for PCR amplification of the day 3 and day 5 cDNA populations using the shorter of the two primer pairs as PCR primer. Driver cDNAs were biotinylated using the Photobiotin reagent supplied by Vector Laboratories according to manufacturers instructions. The subtractive hybridization involved a combination of short and long hybridizations and a simultaneous generation of both day 5 and day 3 sequence-enriched libraries (see Ref. 21Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar for a detailed discussion of the subtractive strategy). For each, biotinylated driver and nonbiotinylated tracer were mixed at a 20:1 molar ratio and co-precipitated. The mixture was then resuspended in 20 μl of 10 nm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, and boiled for 3 min. This was then mixed with an equal volume of 2 × hybridization buffer (1.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, pH 7.5) overlaid with mineral oil and then boiled for a further 3 min to ensure denaturation. The denatured cDNA samples were then allowed to hybridize at 68 °C for 2 h (short hybridization) or 20 h (long hybridization) following which 9 volumes of 10 mm Hepes, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.5, prewarmed to 55 °C was added and the tubes incubated at 55 °C for 5 min. The aqueous phase was then transferred to a fresh tube to which 20 μl of streptavidin at 2 μg/μl (in 0.15m NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) was added and the mixture incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Protein and protein-DNA complexes were removed by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by four further streptavidin incubation and extractions. Finally the subtracted material was subjected to two more phenol/chloroform extractions and one extraction with chloroform. After 6 rounds of short and long subtractions (21Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), cDNA fragments were cloned into Bluescript (pSK+) and random clones selected for sequencing. Sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer. For Northern blotting, 1.4% formaldehyde/agarose gels were run with 2 or 20 μg of mRNA or total RNA, respectively, and blotted according to standard protocols onto Hybond-N. Similarly for Southern blots, agarose gels with 5 μg of cDNA per lane were run and blotted onto Hybond-N. All probes were labeled by random priming using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech “Ready to Go” labeling kit. The full-length JB542 cDNA was isolated from the day 5 EB cDNA library by PCR using two primers internal to the JB542 sequence and the flanking T3 and T7 sites in pBK-CMV which can be rescued for the Zap Express λ vector. The internal JB542 primers used were: 1) 5′-TTCCCAGCCATCTTCTGGTCTCGGGCC-3′; 2) 5′-GGCCCGAGACCAGAAGATGGCTGGGAA-3′. Following sequencing of the full-length cDNA, it was re-derived from murine FDCPmix RNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR using PFU Taq polymerase and three independent clones were analyzed to verify sequence. The murine FDCPmix cell line was maintained and induced to differentiate essentially as described previously (23Testa N.G. Molineux G. Haemopoiesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were maintained in Fischers medium with 10% donor horse serum and interleukin-3 and subcultured every 3–4 days. Neutrophilic differentiation was induced by addition of interleukin-3, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and the cells allowed to develop for 7 days. Monocytic/macrophage differentiation was induced by culturing cells in interleukin-3, granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and macrophage-colony stimulating factor for 10 days. Following completion of the differentiation program cells were harvested and total RNA prepared using Trizol. The success of the differentiation was confirmed by morphological analysis of the cells following cytospinning and staining with May Grunwald and Giemsa (data not shown). For generation of lineage-depleted cells, murine bone marrow cells were depleted of lineage marker-bearing cells using cell surface markers specific for B cells (B220), T cells (CD4 and CD5), macrophages/monocytes (Mac1), and granulocytes (Gr1). The residual subpopulation of cells that were negative for the above lineage markers were therefore enriched for primitive hemopoietic cells. This population is referred to in the text as the lin− population. mRNA was generated from bone marrow and the lin− population using the Invitrogen microfast track mRNA kit and cDNA produced using the Invitrogen copy kit. Each of the cDNA preparations were sheared with AluI and linkers were ligated on to allow PCR amplification of the cDNA populations. It is important to note that different linkers were used for each cDNA preparation to minimize the chances of carry-over or cross-contamination between the different cDNAs during PCR. The cDNAs were amplified by PCR and used in Southern blotting experiments to assess gene expression. Success of the sorting and cDNA generation exercise has been confirmed previously (24Nibbs R.J.B. Lowe S.M. Pragnell I.B. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12495-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Separately, individual lineages were enriched using specific anti-surface marker antibodies. The antibodies used were TER-119 for erythrocytes (PharMingen), CD41 for megakaryocytes (PharMingen), Gr-1 for granulocytes (Cambridge Bioscience), CD11b for monocytes and macrophages (PharMingen), and CD3 for T-lymphocytes (Cambridge Biosciences). Cells were isolated using Dynabeads according to the manufacturers instructions, the cells washed, lysed, and RNA prepared using Trizol. JB542 expression was analyzed by PCR using the following primers which are expected to yield a product of 386 base pairs: 5′-CACTTCATATCCCCGTGAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTCATCAAACTTGGTGCTG-3′. PCR was carried out for 30 cycles as described previously (24Nibbs R.J.B. Lowe S.M. Pragnell I.B. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12495-12504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Procedures for in situhybridization of EB sections were derived from hybridization protocols for mouse embryo sections (25Nichols J. Davidson D. Taga T. Yoshida K. Chambers I. Smith A. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Wilkinson D.G. Green J. Coop A.J. Cockroft D.L. Postimplantation Mammalian Embryos: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 155-171Google Scholar) and from whole mount in situ hybridization procedures on Ebs. 2U. Menzel, personal observations. Briefly, EBs allowed to differentiate in vitro for various periods of time were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded into paraffin wax, and cut into 7-μm sections. Hybridization conditions were as described (25Nichols J. Davidson D. Taga T. Yoshida K. Chambers I. Smith A. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Single-stranded riboprobes for α-globin were synthesized as run-off transcripts from linearized plasmid templates under standard conditions, essentially as described (27Rosen B. Beddington R.S.P. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Signal was visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibodies and NBT/BCIP color substrate. To investigate the usefulness of differentiating ES cells as a source of known and novel hemopoietic gene products we have performed subtractive hybridization using cDNA populations obtained from day 3 and day 5 embryoid bodies. We have used intact embryoid bodies as our cDNA source in an attempt to ensure inclusion of both hemopoietic and stromal/supportive cell gene products in the subtracted library. Prior to the initiation of the subtractive hybridization, the successful generation of HSCs within the EBs was confirmed by measurement of “transiently engrafting” CFU-A stem cell activity in the day 5 EBs as described previously (19Hole N. Graham G.J. Menzel U. Ansell J.D. Blood. 1996; 88: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subtractive hybridization was carried out using the “Gene Expression Screen” method of Wang and Brown (21Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The success of the subtractive hybridization is shown in Fig.1 a which demonstrates effective removal of common β-actin sequences after 4 rounds of subtraction and substantial up-regulation of hemopoietic specific α-globin gene sequences over the six rounds of subtraction. Slot-blot analysis (Fig. 1 b) of a number of cDNAs from the subtracted library has demonstrated only low numbers (less than 10%) of non-day 3/day 5 differentially expressed cDNAs, thus further confirming the success and completeness of the subtraction. Also shown in Fig. 1 b is differential expression of the primitive hemopoietic markers Scl (28Porcher C. Swat W. Rockwell K. Fujiwara Y. Alt F.W. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1996; 86: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 29Robb L. Elwood N.J. Elefanty A.G. Kontgen F. Harvey Li., R. Barnett L.D. Begley C.G.

Blood. 1994; 85: 159-167Google Scholar) confirming the usefulness of the day 3/day 5 time frame as a source of known genes of importance to hemopoietic stem cell generation and function. We have sequenced 474 cDNAs from this subtracted library and data base searching has demonstrated 132 of these sequences to be identical to cDNAs already deposited in the non-EST data bases. Of these 132 cDNAs, which are representative of 80 discrete gene products, 61 (representative of 31 discrete gene products) are known to be primarily expressed in, and to function in, hemopoietic or hemopoietic supportive cells (TableI). Among the hemopoietic cell-associated sequences is a number characteristic of primitive hemopoietic cells and these include the transcription factors Ikaros (31Nichogiannopoulou A. Trevisan M.

Guillemot J.C. Caput D. Lim B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1479-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, the transcription factorTel identified in the library has a known role in HSC migration during development and may functionally relate to the CXCR4 chemokine receptor in this context (36Whetton A.D. Graham G.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 233-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 37Wang L.C. Swat W. Fujiwara Y. Davidson L. Visvander J. Kuo F. Alt F.W. Gilliland D.G. Golub T.R. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2392-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The presence of these cDNAs in the subtracted library, along with the demonstration of differential expression of CD34 and Scl (Fig.1 b) further confirms the usefulness of the ES cell differentiation system as a source of known genes of importance to primitive hemopoietic cell function. The hemopoietic supportive cell-associated cDNAs include a number of sequences associated with bone marrow stromal cells such as the integrin ligands collagen, fibronectin, and laminin (34Simmons P.J. Levesque J-P. Zannettino A.C.W. Bailliere's Clin.

Blood. 2000; 95: 1993-1999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the adipocytic cDNAs Paf-1 and apolipoprotein-B. The remaining 71 (46 discrete gene products) identifiable sequences show no clear commonality in their tissue affiliations and appear to have little in common in either their known functions or expression patterns (Table II). Thus this preliminary sequencing data suggests that ∼46% of identifiable cDNAs in the subtractive library are of relevance to the process of hemopoiesis with 38% being of hemopoietic cell origin and 8% being derived from presumed hemopoietic supportive cells. The fact that there is no other major tissue-specific gene expression represented in the library indicates that hemopoiesis is the predominant developmental process occurring in the EBs between days 3 and 5 of differentiation.Table IList of known haemopoietic and haemopoietic related gene products in the subtracted library (for this and subsequent tables, numbers in brackets represent numbers of repeats of the individual sequences)Clone No.Accession No.DescriptionHaemopoieticJB536NM_001773MurineCD34JB287L03547Murine Ikarostranscription factorJB311AF017275MurineGfi-1B transcription factor (2)JB340L07918Murine GDP dissociation inhibitor (5)JB82U19617Murine Elf-1 transcription factorJB524Y07915Murine TEL transcription factorJB218P06802Plasma cell membrane glycoprotein (PC-1) (4)JB192P03979TCR γ-chain V region PT-gamma-½ precursorJB140X97399Murine Procathespsin EJB245L35933Murine erythrocyte membrane protein 4.2 (3)JB110X78709Murine NRF1transcription factorJB71P04919Band 3 anion exchange protein (MEB3)JB50X6459450-kDa Erythrocyte plasma membrane glycoproteinJB57NM_008816MurinePECAMJB48M15268Murine 5-aminolevulinic acid synthetase (2)JB6S76831Murine tropomodulin (4)JB442S32537Murine erythroid transcription factorNF-E2 (3)JB40M26897Murine ε-globin (4)JB29M26894Murine β-H1-globin (8)JB21S71555Murine β globin (2)JB532AF078905Murine ζ globinJB195U34627Murine α-4 integrinJB534AF026509Murine integrin β-3 subunitHaemopoietic relatedJB18M14423Murine pro-α-1 type 1 collagen (3)JB31M85212Murine tartrate resistant acid phosphataseJB65Q09163Preadipocyte factor-1JB70M14081Apolipoprotein BJB107X83930Murine VE-cadherinJB226U43541Murine laminin β-2 (2)JB342U82612FibronectinJB535AF125176Murine angiopoietin related Open table in a new tab Table IIList of known non-haemopoietic gene productsin the subtracted libraryClone No.Accession No.DescriptionJB1U75215Mouse neutral amino acid transporterJB2AJ006278Acetylglucosaminyltransferase-like protein (2)JB8U24674Mouse Mxi1JB22D67076MouseADAMTS-1JB24X03351Prealbumin (2)JB27U09816GM2 activator proteinJB53Y12582Mouse calpain-like proteaseJB69X95825Mono-ADP ribosyltransferaseJB76D49914Mouse seryl t-RNA synthaseJB112L25338Mouse folate-binding proteinJB113X52634tlm oncogeneJB123L05781Cytosolic epoxide hydrolaseJB147X07201H19 gene (2)JB153X84301MLE transposase (2)JB157P54729BS4 proteinJB181X98330Cardiac ryanodin receptorJB330U18869Mouse mitogen responsive phosphoprotein p96JB188J04970Carboxypeptidase M (2)JB201U49968Lipoma preferred partnerJB209AB004109Phosphatidylserine synthaseJB211U29726MAP kinaseJB215M80783Human B12 protein (TNFα induced)JB227U80040Human nuclear AconitaseJB240L09159Selenium-dependent/RHOA proto-oncogene (5)JB256AB004231Selenium-dep"
https://openalex.org/W1986805475,"The presence of two short signature sequence motifs (His-Ile-Gly-His (HIGH) and Lys-Met-Ser-Lys (KMSK)) is a characteristic of the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.

In particular, the second lysine of the KMSK motif (K2) is the crucial catalytic residue for stabilization of the transition state of the amino acid activation reaction (aminoacyl-adenylate formation).

At the first step, the aaRSs specifically bind the amino acid and ATP to activate the amino acid through the formation of an aminoacyl-adenylate. At the second step, the aminoacyl moiety is transferred to the 3′-terminal adenosine (A76) of the tRNA. The 20 aaRSs are divided into two classes (10 members each) on the basis of their evolutionarily distinct ATP-binding catalytic domains (1Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 2Cusack S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The class I aaRSs are characterized by the Rossman-fold architecture of the catalytic domain and by the two short conserved sequence motifs, His-Ile-Gly-His (HIGH) and Lys-Met-Ser-Lys (KMSK). These motifs, which are far apart in the primary sequence, come together in the three-dimensional structure to constitute a portion of the ATP-binding site. The second lysine in the KMSK motif (K2) plays a key role in the catalysis, as its mutation causes the most severe defect in the enzymatic activity (3Fersht A.R. Knill-Jones J.W. Bedouelle H.

In the crystal structure of the glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS)·tRNAGln·ATP complex, this lysine interacts with the α-phosphate of the ATP molecule (7Rould M.A. Perona J.J. Söll D. Steitz T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In the structures of the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase·Trp-AMP and GlnRS· tRNAGln·Gln-AMP analog complexes (8Doublié S.

Thus, it is now believed that K2 stabilizes the negatively charged transition state of the first reaction step in the class I synthetases (10Perona J.J. Rould M.A. Steitz T.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8758-8771Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In agreement with the proposed function, K2 is strictly conserved in the class I aaRSs, with only a few exceptions. Arginyl-tRNA synthetase (ArgRS) is the only class I enzyme for which many species lack the apparent KMSK motif and, subsequently, the K2 counterpart. Recently, the atomic structures of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (11Cavarelli J. Delagoutte B. Eriani G. Gangloff J. Moras D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5438-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and Thermus thermophilus 2A. Shimada, O. Nureki, and S. Yokoyama, unpublished result. ArgRSs have been determined. In both enzymes, the KMSK motif is degenerate, but 407GMST410 (yeast ArgRS) and394QMSG397 (T. thermophilus ArgRS) were shown to be its structural variants, in which the class I principle lysine (K2) residues are absent. As the ATP-bound structures are not available for both the yeast and T. thermophilus enzymes, the mechanism by which these ArgRSs compensate for the lack of K2 remains obscure. [32P]Sodium pyrophosphate andl-[14C]arginine were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The Pyrobest DNA polymerase for PCR and the restriction endonuclease Nde I were obtained from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. (Shiga, Japan). The restriction endonuclease Bbr PI was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Tokyo, Japan). T7 RNA polymerase was purified from an overproducing strain, kindly provided by Dr. W. Studier (Stonybrook, New York), according to Ref. 12Zawadzki V. Gross H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar. The wild-type T. thermophilus ArgRS was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells by using a T7-promotor-controlled expression vector. The protein was purified by a combination of heat treatment (70 °C for 30 min) and sequential chromatographies on DEAE-Sephacel (φ2.5 × 20 cm) and FPLC PhenylSuperose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, United Kingdom). The expression plasmid for the mutant T. thermophilus ArgRS (K116G) was generated from the vector for the wild-type enzyme. A 357-base pair-long DNA fragment (Nde I-Bbr PI sites) in the enzyme gene was replaced by a PCR-amplified fragment that contains the AAG to GGG mutation in the 116th codon (Lys → Gly). The target mutation and integrity of the gene outside of the mutation site were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant ArgRS was expressed in theE. coli cells and was purified according to the procedure used for the wild-type enzyme. The purified mutant ArgRS shows the same mobility on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as the wild-type enzyme. The wild-type and mutant ArgRSs exhibit the same circular dichroism (CD) spectra with the calculated α-helical content of 45%, which is consistent with the structural data. The two proteins are thermostable: the temperature profiles of the CD (222 nm) are linear and reversible in a wide temperature range (20–95 °C). T. thermophilus tRNAArg was synthesized by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase and was purified as described previously (13Nureki O. Niimi T. Muramatsu T. Kanno H. Kohno T. Florentz C.

The arginine (and tRNA)-dependent PPi-ATP isotopic exchange reaction was carried out at 65 °C in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.2) containing 20 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 2 mm arginine, 20 μmtRNAArg transcript, 4 mm ATP, 4 mm[32P]sodium pyrophosphate (1.8 TBq mol−1), and 50 nm (wild-type or mutant) ArgRS. After various incubation times, a 10-μl aliquot of the reaction was withdrawn, and the amount of the synthesized [32P]ATP was measured as described previously (15Calendar R. Berg P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The aminoacylation reaction was carried out at 65 °C in 100 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mmMgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 4 mm ATP, 100 μml-[14C]arginine, 20 μm tRNAArg transcript, and 100 nm(wild-type or mutant) ArgRS. At various incubation times, an 8-μl aliquot was removed, and the reaction was quenched by addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. It was washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid on a filter paper (Whatman 3MM, φ24 mm), and the radioactivity of the acid-insoluble fraction (the synthesized [14C]Arg-tRNAArg) was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. We have recently determined the structure of another class I synthetase, T. thermophilus glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS), bound to ATP, which is the first tRNA-free, ATP-bound structure of a class I synthetase. 3S. Sekine, O. Nureki, D. G. Vassylyev, and S. Yokoyama, unpublished result. In contrast to the ArgRSs, the overwhelming majority of GluRSs possess the highly conserved KMSK signature motif (243KISK246 forT. thermophilus GluRS). In the GluRS·ATP complex, the side chain of Lys246 (the class I K2) forms a salt bridge with the α-phosphate of ATP (Fig.1 A), which is consistent with its catalytic function. The structures of the catalytic domains are well conserved between the two ArgRSs (yeast and T. thermophilus) and T. thermophilus GluRS (the root mean square displacements are 1.92 and 1.88 Å for 75 and 74 Cα atoms, respectively), which suggests the similarity in the ATP binding mode. To identify the functional counterpart of K2 in the ArgRSs, the ATP-binding sites of the ArgRSs were compared with that of the ATP-bound GluRS (Fig. 1). To our surprise, the superpositions showed that the ζ ammonium groups of the lysine residues, Lys156in the yeast and Lys116 in the T. thermophilus ArgRSs, respectively, are located in close vicinity of the GluRS ATP α-phosphate (distances are 4.3 and 3.2 Å, respectively), without any modification of the synthetase structures (Fig. 1). These lysine residues protrude from the HIGH loops (the N-terminal loop of the HIGH motif) to form a putative contact with the ATP α-phosphate oxygen from the opposite direction of the GluRS KMSK lysine (K2). To investigate the functional significance of the HIGH-loop lysine residue, we prepared a T. thermophilus ArgRS with the mutation of Lys116 to Gly (K116G), and its catalytic activities were compared with those of the wild-type enzyme. The mutant ArgRS (K116G) exhibits considerably lower activity for the arginine (and tRNAArg)-dependent PPi-ATP isotopic exchange, which is the reverse reaction of Arg-AMP formation (first step of aminoacylation) (Fig.2 A). The initial rate catalyzed by the mutant ArgRS is reduced by a factor of >1000, as compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. Consistently, the arginine charging on tRNAArg catalyzed by the mutant ArgRS (K116G) is not detectable (Fig. 2 B). Thus, we conclude that this lysine residue plays a crucial role during the aminoacylation reaction, in particular at the first step. It probably compensates for the lack of the second lysine (K2) in the KMSK motif.Figure 2The effects of the mutation of HIGH-loop lysine on the ArgRS activities.

The distribution of ArgRSs with the HIGH-loop lysine extends to Eukarya, Archaea, and several taxons of Bacteria (Proteobacteria β/γ subdivision,Thermus-Deinococcus group, Cyanobacteria, and so on) (“HIGH group”). Remarkably, these ArgRSs do not possess a canonical KMSK motif (11Cavarelli J. Delagoutte B. Eriani G. Gangloff J. Moras D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5438-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), which suggests that in these enzymes, the HIGH-loop lysine is likely to play the role of the class I K2. In contrast, in several bacterial classes (Proteobacteria α/ε subdivision, most Gram-positive bacteria, and Aquificales), a glycine residue substitutes for the HIGH-loop lysine in the ArgRSs (Fig. 3). Consistently, these bacteria preserve the KMSK motif, suggesting that the canonical class I K2 lysine mediates the adenylate formation (“KMSK group”). Exceptionally, a few archaea lack both the HIGH-loop and KMSK lysines, which suggests a somewhat different architecture of the active center and/or mechanism of the catalysis (tentative group). As far as we see from the sequences of the class I synthetases, the HIGH-loop lysine is a unique characteristic of the ArgRSs, and the purpose of the drastic migration of the catalytic residue in the primary sequences is not clear. ArgRS is one of the three class I synthetases that possess a tRNA-dependent mechanism of amino acid activation (16Mitra K. Mehler A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5161-5162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mitra S.K. Mehler A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5490-5494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mehler A.H. Mitra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 242: 5495-5499Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Thereby, one possibility is that the appearance of the HIGH-loop lysine might be the result of the coevolution of the ArgRSs and tRNAArg molecules from the subsequent organisms. It is worth mentioning that some ArgRSs from the HIGH group contain KMSK-like sites (E. coli etc.) (Fig. 3). Although the lysines of these sites are shifted in sequence from their positions within the canonical KMSK motifs (Fig. 3) (11Cavarelli J. Delagoutte B. Eriani G. Gangloff J. Moras D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5438-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we cannot exclude here the possibility of their catalytic role. The aaRSs are known to be potential targets for antibiotics. Mupirocin is a natural catalytic inhibitor that is specific to the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases (IleRSs) from several Gram-positive and -negative bacterial pathogens. Several artificial Ile-AMP analogs have been developed to block the catalytic sites of the IleRSs of pathogens, but not to bind the human IleRS (reviewed in Ref. 19Schimmel P. Tao J. Hill J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1599-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Similarly, it might be possible to design Arg-AMP analogs that are sensitive to either the KMSK or HIGH-loop lysine in the ArgRSs. This would be especially useful, as the KMSK group includes the ArgRSs from many pathogens, such asRickettsia prowazekii, Helicobacter pylori,Mycobacterium, and Mycoplasma species, etc., whereas all of the eukaryotic enzymes (including human) belong to the HIGH group. Thus, the diversity of the catalytic mechanisms in the ArgRS family could be utilized for the development of new selective anti-infectives."

Recently, an interferon-stimulated response like element (ISRE) competent for binding of interferon-stimulated gene factor-3γ (p48) has been identified in the HBV enhancer I region. Mutation of this element was shown to abrogate IFNα-mediated reduction of HBV X-gene promoter-driven reporter gene expression. This suggested a role of the ISRE and of p48 in IFNα-induced antiviral activity against productive HBV infection. Here, we analyzed the antiviral effect of both IFNα and enhanced p48 expression on complete HBV genomes containing the wild-type or mutated ISRE. In human hepatoma cells transfected with both genomes, viral RNA and replicative intermediates were reduced by IFNα treatment to a similar degree. Enhanced p48 expression increased IFNα-induced suppression of HBV RNA significantly from 75 ± 22.5% to 46 ± 9.8%, but this was independent of the integrity of the ISRE-like region. These data imply that p48 neither mediates the antiviral activity of IFNα against HBV nor down-regulates enhancer I activity by binding directly to the HBV ISRE-like region, but rather argue for an indirect role of p48.

Mason W.S. Cell. 1982; 29: 403-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). From the cytoplasm, the nucleocapsids are either shuttled to the endoplasmic reticulum and converted to mature virions for transport out of the cell or to the nucleus for the establishment of a pool of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) (2Tuttleman J.S. Pourcel C. Summers J. Cell. 1986; 47: 451-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The cccDNA in the nucleus serves as template for transcription of the pregenomic/C mRNA and subgenomic RNAs. The designation pregenomic/C mRNA derives from the fact that it serves both for translation of the core protein and as template for the generation of the viral DNA genome by reverse transcription. Worldwide, more than 300 million people are chronically infected with HBV (3Yen T.S.B. Semin. Virol. 1998; 8: 319-326Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interferon-α (IFNα) treatment is one of the few effective therapies for chronic HBV carriers. However, it results in efficient reduction of the viral load only in 10–20% of treated patients and rarely, if at all, in complete virus elimination. So far, the mechanisms responsible for the IFNα-mediated reduction of the viremia in responding patients remain elusive. In vitro, IFNα-induced antiviral mechanisms against HBV have mostly been examined by using hepatoma cell lines expressing viral products from integrated or transiently transfected HBV DNA, since cell lines permissive for HBV infection are not available. Antiviral studies with IFNα in these systems led to intracellular inhibition of one or several HBV products depending on the type of cell line and system used (4Berthillon P. Crance J.M. Leveque F.

In the human hepatoma cell line Hep-HB107, which stably expresses HBV from a chromosomally integrated copy of the viral genome, IFNα treatment reduces the amount of intracellular replicative DNA intermediates, but affects neither viral polymerase activity within nucleocapsids nor the steady state levels of the viral RNAs (8Hayashi Y. Koike K. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2936-2940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that a posttranscriptional step of viral replication is targeted by IFNα-induced mechanisms, which might affect encapsidation of the pregenomic RNA or the stability of cytoplasmic nucleocapsids. On the other hand, IFNα-induced reduction of the viral RNA was observed in studies using a further stably transfected hepatoma cell line (HepG2.2.15) (5Caselmann W.H. Meyer M. Scholz S. Hofschneider P.H. Koshy R. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 166: 966-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the transiently transfected human hepatoma cell line HuH7 (12Rang A. Gunther S. Will H. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 791-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In HuH7 cells viral RNA levels were reduced posttranscriptionally by IFNα-induced mechanisms. The amount of replicative intermediates was more effectively reduced, suggesting that IFNα induces at least two independent antiviral activities acting on different levels (12Rang A. Gunther S. Will H. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 791-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IFNα was reported to suppress the rate of transcription by down-regulating the activity of the HBV core promoter (13Romero R. Lavine J.E. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 17-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and of the HBV enhancer I (14Tur-Kaspa R. Teicher L. Laub O. Itin A. Dagan D. Bloom B.R. Shafritz D.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as determined in reporter gene experiments with subgenomic HBV DNA fragments. Whether this also occurs in hepatoma cells producing complete HBV genomes has so far not been analyzed. Taken together, it is well established that IFNα can induce an antiviral state against HBV in vitro, but neither the cellular proteins nor the IFNα-sensitive HBV targets involved are clear. In general, induction of an antiviral state in a cell by IFNα starts with the activation of the cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases Tyk2 and Jak1, and phosphorylation of latent cytoplasmic transcription factor subunits called STATs (signal transducer and activator of transcription) (15Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar, 16Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). The STATs then assemble with interferon stimulated gene factor 3γ (p48) to form functional IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which translocates into the nucleus and binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) located within the promoter region of IFNα-inducible genes. Recently, in HuH7 cells treated with IFNα, a protein complex containing the transcription factor p48 was reported to interact with an ISRE-like region located within the enhancer I region of the HBV genome (11Nakao K. Nakata K. Yamashita M. Tamada Y. Hamasaki K. Ishikawa H. Kato Y. Eguchi K. Ishii N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28075-28078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Functional inactivation of the ISRE-like element that abrogated p48 binding in gel shift experiments abolished IFNα-induced suppression of HBV enhancer I activity in reporter gene expression experiments performed with subgenomic HBV DNA fragments. These results suggested that IFNα triggers direct binding of p48 to HBV DNA in concert with other proteins and thereby can modulate enhancer I activity. Since promoter and enhancer activities of HBV in part differ dramatically when full-length genomes or subgenomic fragments are tested (17Schaller H. Fischer M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 168: 21-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the relevance of these findings for IFNα-induced suppression of HBV propagation remains to be determined. This should be possible in hepatoma cells producing infectious virus when transfected with full-length HBV DNA. If IFNα treatment reduces the enhancer I activity also in this system and not only in reporter gene expression experiments, one should observe reduced levels of viral RNA and of other viral gene products (18Bock C. Malek N.P. Tillmann H.L. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2193-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Since the HBV enhancer I is known to support synthesis of all viral transcripts in these cell lines (19Su H. Yee J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), its modulation should affect all viral transcripts and subsequently all products synthesized from them. In the present study, we investigated whether the ISRE-like region and p48 contribute to the antiviral activity induced by IFNα on HBV when propagated in human hepatoma cells. We demonstrate that inactivation of the ISRE-like region has no detectable effect on the IFNα-induced response in this system. Furthermore, overexpression of p48 enhanced IFNα-induced suppression of the viral RNA levels irrespectively of the mutation introduced. These data indicate that neither the ISRE-like region of the HBV nor direct binding of p48 to this element, if occurring at all in the full-length genome context, play a detectable role in the IFNα-induced antiviral state against HBV in hepatoma cells. Plasmid pHBV(wt) contains the HBV-DNA of subtypeayw (20Galibert F. Mandart E. Fitoussi F. Tiollais P. Charnay P. Nature. 1979; 281: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) as head to tail linked dimer cloned via theEco RI site (12Rang A. Gunther S. Will H. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 791-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Plasmid pHBV ISRE(M) was produced by polymerase chain reaction-mediated oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The mutation was introduced into pHBV-1 (plasmid containing the HBV-DNA as monomer, cloned via the Eco RI site) by amplification with Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Deutschland Holding GmbH, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany) and the complementary primer pairs HBV ISRE(M) (5′-GCA GGC ccT CAC cTT CTC GC-3′, only sense strand is shown, mutations are indicated by lowercase letters). Correct mutagenesis was verified by sequencing. The mutated HBV full-length fragment was isolated after Eco RI digestion by elution from an agarose gel. Thereafter, the fragment was inserted as head to tail dimer into the Eco RI site of pUC19. Plasmid pCMV/p48, which codes for human p48 under the control of a CMV promoter, was kindly provided by David E. Levy. The human hepatoma cell line HuH7 was grown as monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmid DNAs used for transfection were purified by ion exchange chromatography and were transfected using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Deutschland Holding GmbH, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany) according to the protocol supplied. Cells (1.3 × 106 cells/5-cm plate) were transfected with 2 μg of the corresponding HBV expression plasmids and 0.25 μg of pCMV/SEAP, which codes for a secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP). Plasmid pCMV/SEAP was cotransfected as control to monitor transfection efficiency and potential IFNα-mediated cytotoxic effects. IFNα-2b (1,000 IU/ml, Intron A, Essex Pharma, Munich, Germany) was added to the medium 16 h after transfection, and cells were harvested for analysis 48 h later. The amount of SEAP activity secreted into the medium of transfected cells was determined as described previously (12Rang A. Gunther S. Will H. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 791-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For overexpression of p48 the pCMV/p48 expression plasmid was used, containing the p48 cDNA under control of a CMV promoter (21Veals S.A. Schindler C. Leonard D. Fu X.Y. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Isolation of intracellular HBV-DNA was performed as described recently (22Rang A. Will H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1120-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared by use of the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Deutschland Holding GmbH, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany) according to the protocol supplied. DNA isolated from cytoplasmic core particles were separated on an 1.2% agarose gel. Ten μg of total RNA were separated on an 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel. DNAs and RNAs were blotted onto “Hybond N” nylon membranes (Nycomed Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) and hybridized with a32P-labeled gel-purified full-length HBV DNA fragment. To standardize the loading, Northern blots were rehybridized with32P-labeled glycerolaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific or actin-specific probes. HBV- and actin-specific probes were generated using a random-primed labeling kit (Nycomed Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Glycerolaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific probes were generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase according to the manual supplied (Promega, Madison, WI). Blots were exposed to Fuji imaging screens, and signals were quantified by a Fujix BAS 2000 bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan) and by TINA software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). HuH7 cells were treated with 1,000 IU/ml IFNα for 3 h or left untreated. In addition, HuH7 cells were pretreated with 100 IU/ml IFNγ for 16 h and, thereafter, with 1,000 IU/ml IFNα for 30 min to increase the amount of activated ISGF3, as described previously (23Grötzinger T.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins were extracted as described previously (22Rang A. Will H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1120-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For EMSA, 15 μg of nuclear protein was preincubated for 5 min at room temperature with or without competitor in 25 μl of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 8% glycerol, 2 μg of poly[d(I-C)], and 0.1 ng of an unrelated single-strand oligonucleotide (5′-ATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGC-3′). For the supershift experiments 2 μg of the indicated antibodies were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature before addition of the labeled double stranded oligonucleotide probes. Polyclonal rabbit antisera against STAT 1 (p84/p91), STAT 2, ISGF-3γ (p48), IRF1, and IRF2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. After addition of the indicated 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes and incubation for 30 min at room temperature, DNA-protein complexes were analyzed on 4% polyacrylamide gels (29:1) containing 25 mm Tris borate and 0.25 mm EDTA. For competition unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were used in equimolar amounts, 10-fold, and 100-fold molar excess. The sequence of double-stranded oligonucleotides (only plus strand sequence indicated) used as probes and/or as competitors in EMSA were: HBV ISRE(wt), 5′-GCAGGCTTTCACTTTCTCGC-3′; ISG15, 5′-GGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC-3′; Sie m67, 5′-GTCGACATTTCCCGTAAATC-3′; control, 5′-GATATAGATTCTGATTTTGGAGAAGAGTCTCTCTTTGATCTGTTCCTCTCAGA-3′. HBV enhancer I activity was shown to affect expression of all viral products (19Su H. Yee J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and its IFNα-mediated suppression was reported to depend on binding of p48 to an ISRE-like region (11Nakao K. Nakata K. Yamashita M. Tamada Y. Hamasaki K. Ishikawa H. Kato Y. Eguchi K. Ishii N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28075-28078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). If p48 binding plays a major role in the antiviral activity of IFNα, as speculated previously, inactivation of the corresponding binding site should reduce IFNα-mediated suppression of HBV on the level of viral RNA and replicative intermediates in cells propagating HBV genomes (18Bock C. Malek N.P. Tillmann H.L. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2193-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To test this, we first wanted to confirm that specific mutations in the HBV ISRE-like region (Fig. 1 A) inactivate p48 binding in an EMSA, as described recently for the corresponding oligonucleotides (11Nakao K. Nakata K. Yamashita M. Tamada Y. Hamasaki K. Ishikawa H. Kato Y. Eguchi K. Ishii N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28075-28078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We used nuclear extracts from IFNα-treated HuH7 cells or untreated cells and32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides of the HBV ISRE-like region (HBV-ISRE wt), the mutated HBV ISRE-like region (HBV-ISRE(M)), the ISRE region of the IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), or the high affinity serum-inducible element sequence (Sie m67). As reported recently (11Nakao K. Nakata K. Yamashita M. Tamada Y. Hamasaki K. Ishikawa H. Kato Y. Eguchi K. Ishii N. J. Biol.

Increasing amounts of the unlabeled HBV-ISRE(wt) oligonucleotide reduced formation of this complex (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4–6). In contrast, addition of the same amounts of the unlabeled HBV ISRE oligonucleotide with mutations (HBV-ISRE(M)) or of a control oligonucleotide unrelated to the ISRE had no effect (Fig.1 B, lanes 7–10). When using the mutated HBV ISRE-like element (HBV-ISRE(M)) as labeled probe for EMSA, no IFN-activated DNA-protein complexes were detected (Fig. 1 B,lanes 16 and 17). As expected IFNα-activated DNA-protein complexes were detected using the ISRE of gene ISG15 (Fig.1 B, lanes 11 and 12) and the Sie m67 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 18 and 19) oligonucleotide probes as positive controls. To further characterize the DNA-protein complexes bound to the HBV ISRE-like region, supershift experiments were performed with antisera against STAT 1, STAT 2, and p48. In these experiments a supershift of DNA-protein complexes was detected only with the Sie m67 oligonucleotide probe after addition of antiserum against STAT 1 (data not shown). Since neither binding of p48 to the HBV ISRE-like region nor binding of the ISGF3 complex (STAT 1, STAT 2, and p48) to the ISG15 ISRE were detected when using these extracts, we performed analogous experiments with nuclear extracts from HuH7 cells pretreated with IFNγ for 16 h before addition of IFNα. This treatment is known to increase the activation of ISGF3 (23Grötzinger T. Jensen K. Will H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25253-25260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Levy D.E. Lew D.J. Decker T. Kessler D.S. Darnell Jr., J.E.

As expected, EMSA with these nuclear extracts showed supershifted signals with antibodies against STAT 1, STAT 2, p48, IRF1, and IRF2 when using the ISG15 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 12–16) or the Sie m67 probes (Fig. 1 C, lane 19), similar as published previously (23Grötzinger T.

When the mutated HBV-ISRE probe (HBV-ISRE(M)) was used in these experiments, neither the same nor other DNA-protein complexes were observed (Fig. 1 C, lanes 8 and 9). This rules out the possibility that binding of other transcription factors to the mutant oligonucleotide compensated for the IFN responsiveness of wt HBV ISRE. The IFN-induced protein-DNA complexes seen with the HBV-ISRE(wt) probe in our experiments did not contain p48 (Fig. 1 C, lane 5) but did contain IRF 1 (Fig. 1 C, lane 6). The latter result is consistent with a perfect IRF element (IRF-E) consensus sequence, known to bind IRF 1 and IRF 2, within the HBV ISRE-like region (Fig. 1 A). Taken together, in contrast to a previous publication (11Nakao K. Nakata K. Yamashita M. Tamada Y. Hamasaki K. Ishikawa H. Kato Y. Eguchi K. Ishii N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28075-28078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), in which binding of p48 to HBV ISRE wt sequence was claimed without including a specificity control for the anti-p48 antibodies used, our data indicate that p48 (although present and active in nuclear extracts from the same type of cells treated with IFNα or IFNγ plus IFNα) neither binds to the HBV-ISRE(wt) nor to the corresponding mutant oligonucleotide, while IRF 1 binds to the HBV-ISRE(wt), but not to the mutant oligonucleotide. For functional analysis of the ISRE-like region in the complete HBV sequence context, we used a plasmid-integrated head to tail dimer of a fully functional HBV genome (pHBV wt) and in parallel the analogous construct containing mutations in the ISRE-like region (see above) of HBV (pHBV ISRE(M)), which abrogated binding of IFN-activated proteins in EMSA. These constructs were transfected into HuH-7 cells together with a plasmid pCMV/SEAP, which codes for a SEAP. Expression of SEAP was measured to control transfection efficiency and to exclude potential cytotoxic effects of IFNα. Sixteen hours after transfection, cells were treated with 1,000 IU/ml IFNα or left untreated. Two days after addition of IFNα, the cell culture medium and the cells were harvested. Both DNA and RNA were extracted and analyzed by Southern and Northern blots. In untreated cells, Northern blots revealed only a minor difference in the levels of the viral RNA produced by HBV wt and the mutant genome, indicating that the mutations had no significant effect on the enhancer activity (Fig.2 B). The slight increase of viral RNA in cells transfected with ISRE mutant virus DNA visible on the Northern blot reflects the corresponding higher transfection efficiency obtained with the mutant genome DNA compared with HBV wt DNA, as evident from the higher levels of SEAP (Fig. 2 A). The amount of replicative DNA intermediates in pHBV ISRE(M)-transfected cells was about 5-fold lower than in cells producing wild-type HBV DNA, as determined by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2 C). This reduced replication efficacy is probably due to one of the three mutations introduced into the ISRE-like region causing an amino acid mutation (F656L) in the C-terminal end of the viral P-protein and the corresponding defect. In cells treated with IFNα, the levels of viral RNA produced by HBV wt and mutant HBV were both decreased (Fig. 2 B), indicating that inactivation of ISRE-like region did not abrogate the reduction of viral RNA levels by IFNα. Similarly, the amount of replicative DNA intermediates was also reduced by IFNα treatment both in the HBV wt and the HBV mutant genome transfected cells (Fig. 2 C). This was not due to a cytotoxic effect of IFNα, as SEAP expression levels were very similar in treated and untreated cells (Fig. 2 A). Independent of the functionality of the ISRE, the antiviral effect of IFNα was reproducibly weaker for viral RNA than for viral DNA (reduction to roughly 70% compared with 15%). This is consistent with our previously reported data, which suggested the existence of at least two antiviral mechanisms activated by IFNα, one acting on the RNA the other on the DNA level (12Rang A. Gunther S. Will H. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 791-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data argue against a significant role of the ISRE-like element in IFNα-induced reduction of viral RNA and replication in HBV producing hepatoma cells. One reason for the lack of a role of the ISRE-like region on replicating virus may be that the ISRE-like region is covered by proteins, which bind to adjacent regions not present in the reporter gene constructs used in previous studies (11Nakao K. Nakata K. Yamashita M. Tamada Y. Hamasaki K. Ishikawa H. Kato Y. Eguchi K. Ishii N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28075-28078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Tur-Kaspa R. Teicher L. Laub O. Itin A. Dagan D. Bloom B.R. Shafritz D.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another reason may be that in the full-length genome context efficient transcription of the HBV DNA from promoters located upstream of the ISRE-like region prevents binding of IFN-activated proteins to the ISRE-like region, while in the reporter gene constructs this region is not transcribed. The major differences in promoter and enhancer activities observed in many reported studies with subgenomic HBV fragments compared with full-length HBV DNA (17Schaller H. Fischer M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 168: 21-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) is consistent with these interpretations. Suppression of enhancer I activity by IFNα-induced p48 binding to the ISRE-like element in previous reporter gene experiments was enhanced by overexpression of p48 in HuH7 cells (11Nakao K. Nakata K. Yamashita M. Tamada Y. Hamasaki K. Ishikawa H. Kato Y. Eguchi K. Ishii N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28075-28078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether overexpression of p48 can increase IFNα-induced suppression of viral RNA and replicative DNA intermediates in the full-length genome context. HuH7 cells were cotransfected with pHBV(wt) and 0.5 or 2 μg of pCMV/p48, treated with IFNα or left untreated, and analyzed as described above. As determined by Northern blotting, IFNα treatment reduced the signal intensities for the viral RNA to about 75% compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3). Cotransfection of 0.5 or 2 μg of pCMV/p48 increased IFNα-induced suppression of the viral RNAs to about 59 and 46%, respectively (Fig.3), as evident from quantitative evaluation of the signals using a bioimager. The results indicate that enhanced expression of p48 increases the antiviral effect of IFNα on the RNA levels in human hepatoma cells. On the level of replicative DNA intermediates, an increase of IFNα-induced suppression was not observed with 0.5 μg of pCMV/p48 expression plasmid and only a modest, but significant, increase with 2 μg of pCMV/p48 compared with the antiviral activity induced by IFNα in the samples from cells not cotransfected with p48-DNA (Fig. 4). Taken together, these data suggest that p48 is present in limiting amounts in human hepatoma cells and contributes to the IFNα-induced antiviral response against HBV on the RNA and DNA level. To examine this further, and to find out whether this contribution depends on the ISRE-like region on HBV, we compared the IFNα-induced suppression on the RNA level of HBV wt and ISRE mutant HBV under conditions of enhanced p48 expression. HuH7 cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of pCMV/p48 and pHBV wt or pHBV ISRE(M), treated with IFNα or left untreated, and analyzed as described above. Independent of the type of HBV genome transfected, RNA levels were reduced to very similar levels by IFNα treatment (Fig.5). These data imply that even under nonlimiting concentrations of p48, the binding of proteins activated by IFNα to the ISRE-like region does not significantly contribute to IFNα-induced reduction of the levels of HBV transcripts in human hepatoma cells. However, our findings do not exclude a function of the ISRE in infected hepatocytes in which the template of transcription is cccDNA, which might allow binding of IRF-1 and/or ISGF3 to the ISRE-like region. A suitable animal system is required to investigate this further.Figure 4Effect of enhanced p48 expression on IFNα-induced reduction of HBV replication.HuH7 cells were treated as described in legend to Fig. 3.

https://openalex.org/W2069153517,"Complex neuronal functions rely upon the precise sorting, targeting, and restriction of receptors to specific synaptic microdomains. Little is known, however, of the molecular signals responsible for mediating these selective distributions. Here we report that metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 7a (mGluR7a) is polarized at the basolateral surface when expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells but is not polarized when expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons. Truncation of the mGluR7 cytoplasmic tail produces a protein that is restricted to a perinuclear intracellular compartment in both neurons and MDCK cells, where this protein colocalizes with a trans-Golgi network antigen. The mGluR7 cytoplasmic domain appended to the transmembrane portion of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein and the ectodomain of human placental alkaline phosphatase is distributed over the entire cell surface in cultured neurons. When expressed in MDCK cells, this construct remains in an intracellular compartment distinct from endosomes or lysosomes. Thus, the cytoplasmic tail domain of mGluR7 is necessary but not sufficient for polarized targeting in MDCK monolayers, whereas in neurons the cytoplasmic tail is sufficient for cell surface expression but not polarization. Additional mechanisms are likely required to mediate mGluR7 neuronal polarization and synaptic clustering."

Anionic phospholipid membranes modify the apparent kinetic parameters of coagulation reactions relative to kinetics in solution. The membrane effect is manifested by a large decrease in the apparentK m of substrates to values far below their respective plasma concentrations. The mechanisms by which this effect manifests itself during TF-mediated coagulation remain speculative. Achieving useful time resolutions has been one of the main obstacles to developing experimental systems to study the presteady-state transients of coagulation factor adsorption and activation on cell membranes. Blood clotting in vivo and in vitro can be completed faster than the sampling intervals of traditional batch systems used to measure membrane reactants. Measurements of fVIIa binding and fXa generation on intact cell membranes under steady-state conditions indicate that TF·fVIIa functional activity is fully expressed before the binding interaction between fVIIa and TF reaches equilibrium (24Dzung T.L. Rapaport S.I. Rao V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15447-15454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ploplis V.A. Edgington T.S. Fair D.S. J. Biol.

Furthermore, under steady-state conditions, the overall rate of coagulation substrate activation on membranes pre-equilibrated with enzyme was close to the theoretical collisional limit (27McGee M.P.

We show that the generation of fXa from plasma fX proceeds via an intermediate step within the membrane. For reactions initiated with fVIIa and fX, the rate of this step and of the overall reaction is limited by the transfer of fX from the adsorption sites to the catalytic sites on the cell's surface.

The cells expressed surface-TF constitutively and interacted functionally with human fVIIa and fX with apparent steady-state kinetic parameters similar to other procoagulant cells, as reported previously (29McGee M.P.

The TF activity of the monolayer suspension in the reaction chamber was equivalent to 6149 ± 847 fmol/ml recombinant TF reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. The chambers were perfused with medium (M-199, Life Technologies, Inc.), buffered with HEPES, and supplemented with 0.1 mm ovalbumin and 3 mm CaCl2. The overall geometrical parameters and TF content in the reaction chamber are summarized in Table I below.Table IReaction chamber parametersDimensions (length × diameter)0.8 cm × 1.4 cmVolume1.23 cm3Microcarriers/chamber6.7 ± 0.2 × 104Microcarrier radius7.5 × 10−3Microsphere area7.0 × 10−4 cm3Microcarrier/chamber volume fraction∼13%Total reactive surface S T1-aTotal surface estimated from microcarrier counts in samples from three different chambers.∼47 cm2TF antigen1-bTissue factor antigen was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in detergent-lysed monolayers.

Open table in a new tab Concentrations of reactants and products in the bulk, flowing, and aqueous phases and on the cell surface during fXa-generating reactions were measured using double- and triple-tracer techniques. These techniques were adapted from previously described and validated methods in perfused organs (32Crone C. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1963; 181: 103-113Google Scholar, 33Eaton B.M. Yudilevich D.L. Am. J.

Coagulation reactions were carried out at physiological concentrations, under flowing conditions. Reactions were initiated by injecting 48–500 ng of fVIIa and 3000–9000 ng of fX into a 1.23-ml reaction chamber. The reactants were rapidly (1–2 s) delivered via a 100-μl bolus and were quickly flow-dispersed in the 1.23-ml reaction chamber to attain maximal initial concentrations of ∼0.8–8 nm fVIIa and 45–135 nm fX. A control tracer of 14C-labeled ovalbumin (833 ng) was also included in the bolus injection yielding an initial maximal concentration of ∼14 nm. To measure membrane concentrations, 3H-labeled fVIIa was used as an adsorbing tracer. Reactants and tracers were in a perfusing medium containing 0.1 mm unlabeled ovalbumin and 3 mmCaCl2. After introducing reactants into the chamber via the inflow tubing, the effluent was collected in 72 samples of 46 ± 2.8 μl each at time resolutions ranging from 2 to 10 s per sample, depending on the perfusion rate. At a flow rate of 13 μl/s, the typical flow velocity in the reaction chamber was estimated at ≲0.2 mm/s. This value is within the ranges measured in rabbit microvasculature in vivo (38Schmid-Schoenbein G.W. Zweifach W. Microvasc. Res. 1975; 10: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Samples were collected in microtiter wells preloaded with Tris buffer solution, pH 8.3, containing 0.2 m EDTA and 0.8m NaCl. A final 5-ml sample was collected to complete the recovery of tracer and to determine perfusion rates. Standard curves for 14C and 3H tracers were constructed from serial dilutions of the solutions used in the bolus injection. Concentrations of control and test radioactive tracers in standard dilutions and effluent samples were measured by scintillation counting. The concentration of product, fXa, was measured by amidolytic assays (13McGee M.P. Foster S. Wang X. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 197: 1847-1854Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Rothberger H. McGee M.P.

Invest. 1984; 73: 1524-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with chromogenic substrate (methoxycarbonyl-d-cyclohexylglycil-arginine-p-nitroanilide acetate) before scintillation counting of radioactive tracers. Functional activity of TF was determined from fXa generation rates in purified systems using amidolytic assay and recombinant proteins as standard. Recombinant TF used to construct standard curves was relipidated into 30:70 phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine vesicles as done before (17McGee M.P. Teuschler H. Liang J. Biochem.

The molar ratio of TF/lipid in the standard TF-phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine preparations was 1/4100. The TF activity measured in intact monolayers was 68.5 ± 19% of that measured in monolayers lysed by freezing/thawing. The control tracer used to measure concentrations in bulk aqueous phase was 14C-labeled ovalbumin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) with a specific activity of 33 μCi/mg. The test tracer for adsorption measurements was fVIIa radiolabeled with tritium using the technique of Van Lenten and Ashwell (40Van Lenten L. Ashwell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1889-1894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with modifications (41Sanders N.L. Bajaj S.P. Zivelin A. Rapaport S.T. Blood. 1985; 66: 201-204Crossref Google Scholar). Labeled preparations had specific activities of 1.8×108 cpm/mg of fVIIa and a functional activity comparable to unlabeled factor in clotting tests and activating mixtures with purified components (29McGee M.P. Teuschler H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The surface reactions leading to fXa generation were analyzed according to the following scheme, fVIIa+TF⇄k+Ek−EEEquation 1 E+fX⇄k+ak−aE⋅fX−k+fXa+EEquation 2 where E ≡ fVIIa·TF is the fVIIa and TF complex (“enzyme”) that forms and dissociates with rate constantsk +E andk −E, respectively. The substrate·enzyme complex denoted byE·fX associates and dissociates with a second-order rate constant,k +a, and a first-order rate constant,k −a, respectively. The effective rate of product (fXa) formation from the complex and its irreversible release are denoted by the first-order rate constant,k +. Denoting the surface concentrations of each species by (Γ1, Γ2, Γ3, Γ4, Γ5, Γ6) ≡ (fVIIa, fX, TF, E, E·fX, fXa), the full kinetic equations consistent with Eqs. 1 and 2 are Γ1=−k+EΓ1Γ3+k−EΓ4−β1Γ1+α1C1(t)Equation 3 Γ2=−k+aΓ2Γ4+k−uΓ5−β2Γ2+α2C2(t)Equation 4 Γ3=−k+EΓ1Γ3+k−EΓ4Equation 5 Γ^4=k+EΓ1Γ3−k−EΓ4−k+aΓ2Γ4+k−a+k+Γ5Equation 6 Γ˙5=k+aΓ2Γ4−k−a+k+Γ5Equation 7 Γ^6=k+Γ5+α6C6−β6Γ6Equation 8 where Γ˙i(t) ≡dΓi(t)/dt, withi = (1Mcfarlane R.G.

The constantsk ±E andk ±acorrespond to effective rates of fVIIa- and fX-binding interactions with TF and E, respectively. These coefficients include the time delays of all intermediary processes on the membranes before the interactions. The time distributions of these unspecified processes are accounted for in our numerical predictions of the time course for the overall fX activating process. The possibility of inhibition or fX/fXa-destroying sinks is precluded from our data, because, within experimental error, all the absorbed fX is recovered as fXa. In the above nonlinear differential equations, βi and αi are desorption and adsorption rates, respectively. Because the total area fraction of adsorbed species is negligible under our experimental conditions, species adsorption from bulk is simply proportional to the bulk concentration,C i(t), at the surface of each microsphere. As the fluid passes through the ensemble of microcarriers, certain flow lines are faster or slower than the mean flow velocity, resulting in a distribution of reactant velocities. A “lagged normal density curve” (LNDC) has been successfully used to approximate the dispersion resulting from the combined effects of random velocity distribution and molecular diffusion in the human circulatory system (36Bassingthwaighte J.B. Goressky C.A. Renkin E.M. Michel C.C. A Handbook of Physiology, The Cardiovascular System, vol. IV: Microcirculation. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1984: 549-626Google Scholar, 37Bassingthwaighte J.B. Ackerman F.H. Wood E.H. Circulation Res. 1966; 18: 398-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We find good agreement between a fitted lagged density curve and the sequentially measured concentrations in the outflow of the reaction chamber (Fig. 3). Therefore, to simplify the modeling process, we assume that the dispersion and diffusion of all species are equal and use the LNDC to approximate the source,C i(t), surrounding each microcarrier. The parameters used in the lagged density curve will reflect chamber packing characteristics, bulk diffusion constants, and the imposed volume flow rate, J V. Additional details, analysis, and simplifications of Eqs. Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7, Equation 8 are provided under “.” The proportion of fX and fVIIa adsorbed from the flowing phase into the membrane was determined from the difference between the normalized concentrations of control, 14C-labeled ovalbumin, and3H-labeled fVIIa. Concentrations of factor VIIa adsorbed at time t were estimated using Γ1(t)≈14C(t)−3H(t)QTST−1Equation 9 where [14C(t)] and [3H(t)] are the fraction of the total nonadsorbed control and adsorbed test tracer, respectively, collected in the effluent. Q T (in femtomoles) is the total amount of fVIIa added, andS T is the total membrane surface area (≈41–47 cm2). Previous studies measuring adsorption of various coagulation factors, including fVIIa and fX, indicated that adsorption rates are proportional to their aqueous-phase concentration and not significantly different among vitamin K-dependent proteins (28Ellison E. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7997-8003Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 29McGee M.P. Teuschler H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Based on these data, the normalized concentration of 3H-labeled fVIIa was used to trace both fVIIa and fX adsorption. For substrate fX, the membrane concentration Γ2(t) was determined by Γ2(t)≈14C(t)−3H(t)−[fXa(t)]QTST−1Equation 10 where Q T is the total amount (fmol) of fX added, and [fXa(t)] is the fraction of that total released into the aqueous phase as fXa. Tissue factor antigen expressed by the cells was determined in cell lysates using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit with recombinant soluble TF as standard (American Diagnostics). Protein determinations were performed in the same cell lysates with a commercial reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Coagulation fVIIa was human recombinant, kindly donated by Dr. Ulla Hedner (Novo Nordisc, Denmark). Recombinant tissue factor (used as standard in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and functional TF determination in cells) was purchased from American Diagnostics. Human fX and fXa were purchased from Enzyme Laboratories. Data reduction, plotting, and statistical analyses were performed using StatView software (Brain Power, Inc.). Numerical solution of the nonlinear kinetic Eqs. Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7, Equation 8 was performed using adaptive Runge-Kutta method implemented through Matlab. The generation of fXa from fX on live procoagulant cell membranes was examined in reaction chambers filled with spherical cell monolayers. The geometrical and flow characteristics of these reaction chambers are summarized in Fig.1 and TableI, respectively. The distribution of concentrations of reactants in the flowing bulk aqueous phase was followed using control tracer [14C]ovalbumin. Reactions were initiated with fX and fVIIa, and the product, fXa, was measured by amidolytic assay. Reactions were followed until 70–90% of the nonreacting control tracer was recovered in the effluent. The amounts of 14C and 3H tracer collected and the amount of 3H adsorbed to the cell are shown as functions of time in Fig. 2 A. The time evolution of reactants inside the reaction chamber can be fairly well approximated by the LNDC, as shown in Fig.3. This agreement indicates that dispersion of reactants in the chamber due to the random flow distribution and diffusion is qualitatively similar to that encountered in human circulation (36Bassingthwaighte J.B.
