https://openalex.org/W2042520955,"Neuroinflammation and associated neuronal dysfunction mediated by activated microglia play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Microglia are activated by aggregated forms of amyloid-β protein (Aβ), usually demonstrated in vitro by stimulating microglia with micromolar concentrations of fibrillar Aβ, a major component of amyloid plaques in AD brains. Here we report that amyloid-β oligomer (AβO), at 5–50 nm, induces a unique pattern of microglia activation that requires the activity of the scavenger receptor A and the Ca2+-activated potassium channel KCa3.1. AβO treatment induced an activated morphological and biochemical profile of microglia, including activation of p38 MAPK and nuclear factor κB. Interestingly, although increasing nitric oxide (NO) production, AβO did not increase several proinflammatory mediators commonly induced by lipopolyliposacharides or fibrillar Aβ, suggesting that AβO stimulates both common and divergent pathways of microglia activation. AβO at low nanomolar concentrations, although not neurotoxic, induced indirect, microglia-mediated damage to neurons in dissociated cultures and in organotypic hippocampal slices. The indirect neurotoxicity was prevented by (i) doxycycline, an inhibitor of microglia activation; (ii) TRAM-34, a selective KCa3.1 blocker; and (iii) two inhibitors of inducible NO synthase, indicating that KCa3.1 activity and excessive NO release are required for AβO-induced microglial neurotoxicity. Our results suggest that AβO, generally considered a neurotoxin, may more potently cause neuronal damage indirectly by activating microglia in AD.

Aβ aggregates, especially those of the 42-residue Aβ42, are potent toxins to neurons. In addition, Aβ aggregates activate microglia, which clear Aβ, but in the process release inflammatory mediators that cause indirect neurotoxicity (1Cameron B. Landreth G.E. Neurobiol. Dis. 2010; 37: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). A commonly held view is that microglia react to fAβ deposited in amyloid plaques, which form a nidus for microglia-mediated neuronal damage. However, because the number of amyloid plaques correlates poorly with the degree of dementia (2Terry R.D. Masliah E. Salmon D.P. Butters N. DeTeresa R. Hill R. Hansen L.A. Katzman R. Ann. Neurol. 1991; 30: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3399) Google Scholar, 3Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11023) Google Scholar), it follows that plaque-associated microglia may not be a major player in cognitive impairment. Emerging evidence including two recent in vivo positron emission tomography studies indicates that microglia may respond to stimuli other than plaque fAβ (4Edison P. Archer H.A. Gerhard A. Hinz R.

Neurology. 2009; 72: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), suggesting that alternative ways to activate microglia must occur in AD. In addition to fibrillar forms, Aβ exists in various smaller assemblies in AD brains, which may mediate diverse toxic effects at different stages of the disease. Although these smaller aggregates, variously named as oligomers (AβO), protofibrils, amyloid pores, or AD diffusible ligands, have been considered transient or metastable intermediates in fibril formation (6Caughey B. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar), some of them may not be obligate intermediates in the fibril formation pathway and can be stable (7Necula M. Kayed R.

Importantly, recent in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that the build-up of soluble AβO may be an early and central event in the pathogenesis of AD (9Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K.

The strong and rapidly disruptive effect of AβO on synaptic plasticity and neuronal integrity is hypothesized to cause memory problems in AD and is generally attributed to their direct neuro- or synaptotoxicity (3Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11023) Google Scholar). However, one plausible but less studied possibility is that AβO activates microglia and causes indirect, microglia-mediated neuro- and synaptotoxicity. However, AβO, at micromolar concentrations, appeared no more potent than fAβ in activating microglia (13Takata K. Kitamura Y. Umeki M. Tsuchiya D. Kakimura J. Taniguchi T. Gebicke-Haerter P.J.

To examine microglia activators that are pathologically relevant to the development of AD, we investigated the ability of low levels of AβO to activate microglia. Here we report a previously unrecognized AβO effect in activating microglia at 5–50 nm, concentrations that are usually not sufficient to cause direct neurotoxicity. This effect follows a bell-shaped dose-response curve and tapers off at concentrations above 100 nm. Importantly, we show that AβO-activated microglia release NO to cause neuronal damage, and this mode of microglia activation and neurotoxicity is dependent on microglial KCa3.1. Therefore, our data suggest a significant contribution of AβO to microglial neurotoxicity in AD, which may even be more potent than its direct neurotoxicity. This mode of neurotoxicity could be alleviated by inhibitors of KCa3.1 channel activity and NO production. LPS, Congo red (CR), MTT, polyinosinic acid, [3,8-diamino-5-(3-(diethylmethylamino)propyl)-6-phenyl phenanthridinium diiodide (PI), apamin, doxycycline, N-iminoethyl-l-lysine (l-NIL), and N-[(3-aminomethyl)benzyl]acetamidine (1400W) were purchased from Sigma. The CD40 ligand, CD 154, was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The macrophage colony stimulatory factor was purchased from R & D Systems. The KCa3.1 inhibitor TRAM-34 (1-[(2-chlorophenyl)diphenylmethyl]-1H-pyrazole) was synthesized as described previously (20Wulff H. Miller M.J. Hansel W. Grissmer S. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 8151-8156Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). AβO solutions as well as the unaggregated and fibrillary Aβ were prepared as described (21Maezawa I. Hong H.S. Liu R. Wu C.Y. Cheng R.H. Kung M.P. Kung H.F. Lam K.S. Oddo S. Laferla F.M. Jin L.W. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Our preparation of AβO follows the procedure described by Lambert et al. (9Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K. Chromy B.A. Edwards C. Freed R. Liosatos M. Morgan T.E. Rozovsky I. Trommer B. Viola K.L. Wals P. Zhang C. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6448-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (3129) Google Scholar) except that the Aβ42 peptide was diluted with Opti-MEM culture medium instead of the F12 medium originally described, before incubation at 4 °C for 24 h to generate oligomers. This preparation of AβO has been extensively characterized in our laboratory (21Maezawa I. Hong H.S. Liu R. Wu C.Y. Cheng R.H. Kung M.P. Kung H.F. Lam K.S. Oddo S. Laferla F.M. Jin L.W. J.

Neurochem. 2006; 98: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To ensure consistency of quality, a random sample from each batch was chosen and imaged using electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy to characterize the size and shape of the aggregates (21Maezawa I. Hong H.S. Liu R. Wu C.Y. Cheng R.H. Kung M.P. Kung H.F. Lam K.S. Oddo S. Laferla F.M. Jin L.W. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 22Maezawa I. Hong H.S.

The biological activities of each batch were confirmed by determining for AβO the neurotoxic activity, synaptic binding activity, and ability to rapidly induce exocytosis of MTT formazan, as described previously (21Maezawa I. Hong H.S. Liu R. Wu C.Y. Cheng R.H. Kung M.P. Kung H.F. Lam K.S. Oddo S. Laferla F.M. Jin L.W. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 23Hong H.S. Maezawa I.

We obtained hippocampal tissues from three AD subjects and two cognitively and pathologically normal control subjects from the University of California Davis Alzheimer's Disease Center. The use of these samples has been approved by the University of California Davis Institutional Review Board Administration and was reported before (21Maezawa I. Hong H.S. Liu R. Wu C.Y. Cheng R.H.

All of the subjects had comparable postmortem intervals averaging 5.5 h. Soluble extracts from brain tissues were prepared as described (19Lacor P.N. Buniel M.C. Chang L. Fernandez S.J. Gong Y. Viola K.L. Lambert M.P. Velasco P.T. Bigio E.H. Finch C.E. Krafft G.A. Klein W.L. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10191-10200Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 21Maezawa I. Hong H.S. Liu R. Wu C.Y.

Molecular weight fractionation of oligomeric species was performed using Centricon YM-100 and YM-10 concentrators (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The relative abundance of AβO in the resulting solutions was determined by Western blots using the 6E10 antibody and dot blots using the A11 antibody (25Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). Although the AD samples contained various amounts of AβO, the two control samples showed no detectable AβO on Western blots and almost background levels on dot blots. To ensure accurate measurement of the total quantity of Aβ in the extract, we used two Aβ ELISA kits purchased from IBL America (Minneapolis, MN) and Wako Chemicals USA (Richmond, VA), respectively. The procedures were conducted according to manufacturer's protocols. Primary microglia cultures derived from newborn C57BL/6J mice were prepared from mixed glia cultures (1–2 weeks in vitro) with the “shaking off” method as described previously (26Maezawa I. Nivison M. Montine K.S. Maeda N. Montine T.J. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cultures were ≥99% pure for microglia as demonstrated by anti-IBA1 immunostaining. To obtain conditioned medium (CM) for treating neurons, microglia were first cultured in 24-well culture plates at a density of 1.3 × 105 cells/cm2 for 24 h in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (DMEM10). The cultures were washed extensively and changed to the neurobasal medium with B27 supplement (NB/B27; Invitrogen) without serum and cultured for another 24 h. The NB/B27-based microglia CMs were collected, briefly centrifuged, and used immediately or frozen for future uses. Hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from newborn wild type C57BL/6J mice according to the method of Xiang et al. (27Xiang H. Kinoshita Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The neurons were cultured in NB/B27 at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates or 8 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates for at least 14 days before they were treated with microglia CM. Hippocampal slice cultures (400 μm thick) were prepared from 7-day-old C57BL/6J mice as described previously (26Maezawa I. Nivison M. Montine K.S. Maeda N. Montine T.J. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and cultured for 10 days in vitro before use. Neuronal damage in the slices was monitored by PI uptake following Bernardino et al. (28Bernardino L. Xapelli S. Silva A.P. Jakobsen B. Poulsen F.R. Oliveira C.R. Vezzani A. Malva J.O. Zimmer J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6734-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). PI itself is not toxic to neurons (28Bernardino L. Xapelli S. Silva A.P. Jakobsen B. Poulsen F.R. Oliveira C.R. Vezzani A. Malva J.O. Zimmer J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6734-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampal slices were pretreated with or without doxycycline (20 μm), TRAM-34 (1 μm), 1400W (5 μm), or l-NIL (100 μm) for 1 h and then treated with medium containing PI (2 μm) and AβO of indicated concentration, with or without the above inhibitor compound. After 24 h, the slices were observed under a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope, and the red (630 nm) fluorescence emitted by PI taken up by damaged cells was photographed by a digital camera (SPOT RTke, SPOT Diagnostics, Sterling Heights, MI) with fixed exposure time. Microglia were plated onto 48-well culture plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in DMEM10 and incubated for 24 h. The cells were washed with serum-free Opti-MEM medium three times and treated with the indicated concentrations of AβO in Opti-MEM. After 5 h of incubation, 10 μm BrdUrd was added and allowed to be incorporated into DNA of proliferating cells during an additional 16 h of incubation. The cells with positive BrdUrd incorporation were determined by an immunocytochemical stain for BrdUrd using an anti-BrdUrd antibody conjugated with Alexa594 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol (Chemicon) and counted. The detection of cells with active NFκB was performed according to a previously published method (29Franciosi S. Ryu J.K. Choi H.B. Radov L. Kim S.U. McLarnon J.G. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11652-11664Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, microglia were plated as described above and treated with activators for 2 h. The cells were fixed and stained with anti-NFκBp65 antibody (1:250; Chemicon) and with the nuclear dye DAPI. Hippocampal neurons were prepared as described above and were plated onto 96-well plate at a density of 6 × 104 cells/well and cultured for 14 days. CM from microglia cultures was added onto neurons with indicated dilutions, and the cultures were incubated for 24 h. Neuronal viability was evaluated by the MTT assay and the lactate dehydrogenase release assay as described previously (22Maezawa I. Hong H.S. Wu H.C. Battina S.K. Rana S. Iwamoto T. Radke G.A. Pettersson E. Martin G.M. Hua D.H. Jin L.W. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Maezawa I. Nivison M. Montine K.S. Maeda N. Montine T.J. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescent staining of neurons, the cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-PSD95 (1:200; Cell Signaling), anti-MAP2 (1:500; Chemicon), and anti-acetylated α-tubulin (1:250; Zymed Laboratories Inc.). For immunofluorescent staining of microglia, cultures or hippocampal slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-IBA1 (1:500; Wako Chemicals USA), anti-SRA (E-20, 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-CD11b (1:200; AbD Serotec USA, Raleigh, NC). The fixed cells or hippocampal slices were incubated with antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by secondary Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse or Alexa568-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:700; Molecular Probes). Immunostained images were observed under a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope and photographed by a digital camera (SPOT RTke; SPOT Diagnostics, Sterling Heights, MI). For quantification of the PSD95-immunoreactive puncta along the dendrites, photomicrographs of PSD95 immunostained cultures were randomly taken from each culture condition. The images were transformed to 8-bit gray scale and analyzed with the Image J program. The number of puncta in each photomicrograph was counted and normalized by dendritic length. The photography and analysis were conducted in an investigator-blinded manner. To obtain lysates, cells or tissues were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated with a buffer containing 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 2% SDS, proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysates were briefly sonicated and cleared by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 10 min. Equivalent amounts of protein were analyzed by Tris-HCl gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with antibodies. Visualization was performed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The following primary antibodies (dilutions) were used: anti-p38 MAPK (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA), anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Synaptophysin (1:1000; Abcam), anti-PSD95 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-GRIP1 (1:1000; Upstate), anti-MAP2 (1:1000; Chemicon), anti-acetylated α-tubulin (1:2000; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and anti-β-actin (1:3000; Sigma). Secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-goat, or anti-mouse antibody (1:3000; Amersham Biosciences). Conditioned medium collected from microglia cultures (1 × 105/0.75 cm2) and hippocampal slices treated with AβO for 24 h were analyzed by a nitric oxide quantization kit according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). The data were normalized to the amount of total protein. Microglia derived from mixed glia cultures (1–2 weeks in vitro) were washed, attached to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, and then studied in the whole cell mode of the patch clamp technique with an EPC-10 HEKA amplifier. The pipette solution contained 145 mm K+ aspartate, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm K2EGTA, and 8.5 mm CaCl2 (1 μm free Ca2+), pH 7.2, 290 mOsm. To reduce chloride “leak” currents, we used a Na+ aspartate external solution containing 160 mm Na+ aspartate, 4.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 300 mOsm. K+ currents were elicited with voltage ramps from −120 to 40 mV of 200-ms duration applied every 10 s. Whole cell KCa3.1 conductances were calculated from the slope of the TRAM-34-sensitive KCa current between −80 and −75 mV, where KCa3.1 currents are not “contaminated” by Kv1.3 (which activates at voltages above −40 mV) or inward rectifier K+ currents (which activate a voltages more negative than −80 mV). Cell capacitance, a direct measurement of cell surface area, was continuously monitored during recordings. KCa3.1 current density was determined by dividing the TRAM-34-sensitive slope conductance by the cell capacitance. Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaPlot 11 software (Systat Software, Inc). Analysis of variance or repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare quantitative values from cultures across groups. Tukey's studentized range test was used to adjust for multiple comparisons in post hoc pairwise tests. Our AβO preparations affected viability of cultured hippocampal neurons at concentrations above 100 nm, consistent with previously published results (22Maezawa I. Hong H.S. Wu H.C. Battina S.K. Rana S. Iwamoto T. Radke G.A. Pettersson E. Martin G.M. Hua D.H. Jin L.W. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the same preparations induced proliferation of cultured microglia, starting at 5 nm (22.5 ng/ml) and maximizing at ∼50 nm (225 ng/ml) (Fig. 1, A and B). At 24 and 48 h post-stimulation, cell counts in cultures treated with 20 nm AβO were 184 ± 8.59% (mean ± S.E., n = 6, p < 0.001; Fig. 1D) and 330 ± 21.8% (n = 3, p < 0.001; Fig. 1B) of the values of solvent-treated controls, respectively. The identity of the proliferating cells was confirmed by their immunoreactivity to anti-ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA-1), a microglia-specific marker (Fig. 1A). The mitogenic effect was confirmed by BrdUrd incorporation. Proliferation measured by both cell counting and BrdUrd followed a bell-shaped curve (Fig. 1, B and C), which is very similar to the previously reported chemotactic activity of soluble Aβ for macrophages/microglia that also maximized at low nanomolar concentrations (30Davis J.B. McMurray H.F. Schubert D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The mitogenic effect was blocked by a neutralizing oligomer-specific antibody A11 (25Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar) and by CR, an amyloid ligand that neutralizes the activity of AβO (21Maezawa I. Hong H.S. Liu R. Wu C.Y. Cheng R.H. Kung M.P.

Because both A11 and CR recognize conformational features but not the primary sequence of Aβ, our results indicate that the conformation of AβO was responsible for the mitogenic effect. The unaggregated Aβ1–42 showed a mild although statistically not significant induction of proliferation (Fig. 1B), attributable to the small amount of AβO invariably formed in aqueous solution because this effect was also blocked by A11 and CR. Fibrillar Aβ and preparations of reverse sequence Aβ peptide (Aβ42–1) up to 500 nm showed no effect (supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that at concentrations lower than those required for direct neurotoxicity, AβO is mitogenic for microglia. To determine whether AβO derived from human brain would also promote microglia proliferation, we obtained soluble extracts from hippocampi of AD and age-matched nondemented control subjects. Using Centricon concentrators with molecular mass cut-off between 10 and 100 kDa, we prepared fractions containing AβO but excluding unaggregated Aβ and large aggregates.

https://openalex.org/W2034013894,"Background Muscle regeneration depends on satellite cells, myogenic stem cells that reside on the myofiber surface. Reduced numbers and/or decreased myogenic aptitude of these cells may impede proper maintenance and contribute to the age-associated decline in muscle mass and repair capacity. Endurance exercise was shown to improve muscle performance; however, the direct impact on satellite cells in aging was not yet thoroughly determined. Here, we focused on characterizing the effect of moderate-intensity endurance exercise on satellite cell, as possible means to attenuate adverse effects of aging. Young and old rats of both genders underwent 13 weeks of treadmill-running or remained sedentary. Methodology Gastrocnemius muscles were assessed for the effect of age, gender and exercise on satellite-cell numbers and myogenic capacity. Satellite cells were identified in freshly isolated myofibers based on Pax7 immunostaining (i.e., ex-vivo). The capacity of individual myofiber-associated cells to produce myogenic progeny was determined in clonal assays (in-vitro). We show an age-associated decrease in satellite-cell numbers and in the percent of myogenic clones in old sedentary rats. Upon exercise, there was an increase in myofibers that contain higher numbers of satellite cells in both young and old rats, and an increase in the percent of myogenic clones derived from old rats. Changes at the satellite cell level in old rats were accompanied with positive effects on the lean-to-fat Gast muscle composition and on spontaneous locomotion levels. The significance of these data is that they suggest that the endurance exercise-mediated boost in both satellite numbers and myogenic properties may improve myofiber maintenance in aging."
https://openalex.org/W2145136656,"Few studies have quantified regional variation in tree mortality, or explored whether species compositional changes or within-species variation are responsible for regional patterns, despite the fact that mortality has direct effects on the dynamics of woody biomass, species composition, stand structure, wood production and forest response to climate change. Using bayesian analysis of over 430,000 tree records from a large eastern US forest database we characterised tree mortality as a function of climate, soils, species and size (stem diameter). We found (1) mortality is U-shaped vs. stem diameter for all 21 species examined; (2) mortality is hump-shaped vs. plot basal area for most species; (3) geographical variation in mortality is substantial, and correlated with several environmental factors; and (4) individual species vary substantially from the combined average in the nature and magnitude of their mortality responses to environmental variation. Regional variation in mortality is therefore the product of variation in species composition combined with highly varied mortality-environment correlations within species. The results imply that variation in mortality is a crucial part of variation in the forest carbon cycle, such that including this variation in models of the global carbon cycle could significantly narrow uncertainty in climate change predictions."
https://openalex.org/W1967730128,"ZP3, a major component of the zona pellucida (ZP) matrix coating mammalian eggs, is essential for fertilization by acting as sperm receptor. By retaining a propeptide that contains a polymerization-blocking external hydrophobic patch (EHP), we determined the crystal structure of an avian homolog of ZP3 at 2.0 Å resolution. The structure unveils the fold of a complete ZP domain module in a homodimeric arrangement required for secretion and reveals how EHP prevents premature incorporation of ZP3 into the ZP. This suggests mechanisms underlying polymerization and how local structural differences, reflected by alternative disulfide patterns, control the specificity of ZP subunit interaction. Close relative positioning of a conserved O-glycan important for sperm binding and the hypervariable, positively selected C-terminal region of ZP3 suggests a concerted role in the regulation of species-restricted gamete recognition. Alternative conformations of the area around the O-glycan indicate how sperm binding could trigger downstream events via intramolecular signaling."

Trust in informal (interpersonal) information was negatively associated with perceived personal A/H1N1 susceptibility (β = -0.21), which was negatively associated with perceived self-efficacy (β = -0.42) but positively associated with influenza worry (β = 0.44). Trust in informal information was positively associated with influenza worry (β = 0.16) which was in turn associated with greater social distancing (β = 0.36). Multigroup comparisons showed gender differences regarding paths from trust in formal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, trust in informal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, and understanding of A/H1N1 cause to perceived self-efficacy.Trust in government/media information was more strongly associated with greater self-efficacy and handwashing, whereas trust in informal information was strongly associated with perceived health threat and avoidance behaviour.

The Newton hypothesis would be supported if the top-level research more frequently cites previously highly-cited work than that medium-level research cites highly-cited work. Our analysis is based on (i) all articles and proceedings papers which were published in 2003 in the life sciences, health sciences, physical sciences, and social sciences, and (ii) all articles and proceeding papers which were cited within these publications. The results show that highly-cited work in all scientific fields more frequently cites previously highly-cited papers than that medium-cited work cites highly-cited work.We demonstrate that papers contributing to the scientific progress in a field lean to a larger extent on previously important contributions than papers contributing little. These findings support the Newton hypothesis and call into question the Ortega hypothesis (given our usage of citation counts as a proxy for impact)."
https://openalex.org/W2006347607,"Background The pathogenesis of preeclampsia, a serious pregnancy disorder, is still elusive and its treatment empirical. Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) is crucial for placental development and early detection of aberrant regulatory mechanisms of HIF-1 could impact on the diagnosis and management of preeclampsia. HIF-1α stability is controlled by O2-sensing enzymes including prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH), and E3 ligases Seven In Absentia Homologues (SIAHs). Here we investigated early- (E-PE) and late-onset (L-PE) human preeclamptic placentae and their ability to sense changes in oxygen tension occurring during normal placental development. Methods and Findings Expression of PHD2, FIH and SIAHs were significantly down-regulated in E-PE compared to control and L-PE placentae, while HIF-1α levels were increased. PHD3 expression was increased due to decreased FIH levels as demonstrated by siRNA FIH knockdown experiments in trophoblastic JEG-3 cells. E-PE tissues had markedly diminished HIF-1α hydroxylation at proline residues 402 and 564 as assessed with monoclonal antibodies raised against hydroxylated HIF-1α P402 or P564, suggesting regulation by PHD2 and not PHD3. Culturing villous explants under varying oxygen tensions revealed that E-PE, but not L-PE, placentae were unable to regulate HIF-1α levels because PHD2, FIH and SIAHs did not sense a hypoxic environment. Conclusion Disruption of oxygen sensing in E-PE vs. L-PE and control placentae is the first molecular evidence of the existence of two distinct preeclamptic diseases and the unique molecular O2-sensing signature of E-PE placentae may be of diagnostic value when assessing high risk pregnancies and their severity."

https://openalex.org/W2156627613,"Situations requiring rapid decision-making in response to dynamic environmental demands occur repeatedly in natural environments. Neuromodulation can offer important flexibility to the output of neural networks in coping with changing conditions, but the contribution of individual neuromodulatory neurons in social behavior networks remains relatively unknown. Here we manipulate the Drosophila octopaminergic system and assay changes in adult male decision-making in courtship and aggression paradigms. When the functional state of OA neural circuits is enhanced, males exhibit elevated courtship behavior towards other males in both behavioral contexts. Eliminating the expression of the male form of the neural sex determination factor, Fruitless (Fru(M)), in three OA suboesophageal ganglia (SOG) neurons also leads to increased male-male courtship behavior in these same contexts. We analyzed the fine anatomical structure through confocal examination of labeled single neurons to determine the arborization patterns of each of the three Fru(M)-positive OA SOG neurons. These neurons send processes that display mirror symmetric, widely distributed arbors of endings within brain regions including the ventrolateral protocerebra, the SOG and the peri-esophageal complex. The results suggest that a small subset of OA neurons have the potential to provide male selective modulation of behavior at a single neuron level."
https://openalex.org/W2092604966,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a progressive lung disease that is punctuated by periods of exacerbations (worsening of symptoms) that are attributable to viral infections. While rhinoviruses are most commonly isolated viruses during episodes of exacerbation, influenza viruses have the potential to become even more problematic with the increased likelihood of an epidemic.This study examined the impact of current and potential pharmacological targets namely the systemic corticosteroid dexamethasone and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist pioglitazone on the outcome of infection in smoke-exposed mice. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to room air or cigarette smoke for 4 days and subsequently inoculated with an H1N1 influenza A virus. Interventions were delivered daily during the course of infection. We show that smoke-exposed mice have an exacerbated inflammatory response following infection. While smoke exposure did not compromise viral clearance, precision cut lung slices from smoke-exposed mice showed greater expression of CC (MCP-1, -3), and CXC (KC, MIP-2, GCP-2) chemokines compared to controls when stimulated with a viral mimic or influenza A virus. While dexamethasone treatment partially attenuated the inflammatory response in the broncho-alveolar lavage of smoke-exposed, virally-infected animals, viral-induced neutrophilia was steroid insensitive. In contrast to controls, dexamethasone-treated smoke-exposed influenza-infected mice had a worsened health status. Pioglitazone treatment of virally-infected smoke-exposed mice proved more efficacious than the steroid intervention. Further mechanistic evaluation revealed that a deficiency in CCR2 did not improve the inflammatory outcome in smoke-exposed, virally-infected animals.This animal model of cigarette smoke and H1N1 influenza infection demonstrates that smoke-exposed animals are differentially primed to respond to viral insult. While providing a platform to test pharmacological interventions, this model demonstrates that treating viral exacerbations with alternative anti-inflammatory drugs, such as PPAR-gamma agonists should be further explored since they showed greater efficacy than systemic corticosteroids."
https://openalex.org/W2076150020,"Although combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) initiated in the acute phase of HIV-1 infection may prevent expansion of the latent reservoir, its benefits remain controversial. In the current study, HIV-1 RNA transcription patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were monitored during acute cART to assess the effect of early treatment on cellular viral reservoirs.Acutely HIV-1 infected patients (n = 24) were treated within 3-15 weeks after infection. Patients elected to cease treatment after ≥1 year of therapy. HIV-1 DNA (vDNA), HIV-1 RNA species expressed both in latently and productively infected cells, unspliced (UsRNA), multiply spliced (MsRNA-tatrev; MsRNA-nef), and PBMC-associated extracellular virion RNA (vRex), expressed specifically by productively infected cells, were quantified in PBMC by patient matched real-time PCR prior, during and post cART. In a matched control-group of patients on successful cART started during chronic infection (n = 15), UsRNA in PBMC and vDNA were measured cross-sectionally. In contrast to previous reports, PBMC-associated HIV-1 RNAs declined to predominantly undetectable levels on cART. After cART cessation, UsRNA, vRex, and MsRNA-tatrev rebounded to levels not significantly different to those at baseline (p>0.1). In contrast, MsRNA-nef remained significantly lower as compared to pretreatment (p = 0.015). UsRNA expressed at the highest levels of all viral RNAs, was detectable on cART in 42% of patients with cART initiated during acute infection as opposed to 87% of patients on cART initiated during chronic infection (Fisher's exact test; p = 0.008). Accordingly, UsRNA levels were 105-fold lower in the acute as compared to the chronic group.Early intervention resulted in profound depletion of PBMC expressing HIV-1 RNA. This is contrary to chronically infected patients who predominantly showed continuous UsRNA expression on cART. Thus, antiretroviral treatment initiated during the acute phase of infection prevented establishment or expansion of long-lived transcriptionally active viral cellular reservoirs in peripheral blood."
https://openalex.org/W2077506711,"Uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) is known to suppress mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and is employed by drug-resistant cancer cells to mitigate oxidative stress. Using the drug-sensitive HL-60 cells and the drug-resistant MX2 subline as model systems, we show that genipin, a UCP2 inhibitor, sensitizes drug-resistant cells to cytotoxic agents. Increased MX2 cell death was observed upon co-treatment with genipin and different doses of menadione, doxorubicin, and epirubicin. DCFH-DA fluorimetry revealed that the increase in MX2 cell death was accompanied by enhanced cellular ROS levels. The drug-induced increase in ROS was linked to genipin-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial proton leak. State 4 and resting cellular respiratory rates were higher in the MX2 cells in comparison to the HL-60 cells, and the increased respiration was readily suppressed by genipin in the MX2 cells. UCP2 accounted for a remarkable 37% of the resting cellular oxygen consumption indicating that the MX2 cells are functionally reliant on this protein. Higher amounts of UCP2 protein were detected in the MX2 versus the HL-60 mitochondria. The observed effects of genipin were absent in the HL-60 cells pointing to the selectivity of this natural product for drug-resistant cells. The specificity of genipin for UCP2 was confirmed using CHO cells stably expressing UCP2 in which genipin induced an ∼22% decrease in state 4 respiration. These effects were absent in empty vector CHO cells expressing no UCP2. Thus, the chemical inhibition of UCP2 with genipin sensitizes multidrug-resistant cancer cells to cytotoxic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1982381273,"The A11 diencephalospinal pathway is crucial for sensorimotor integration and pain control at the spinal cord level. When disrupted, it is thought to be involved in numerous painful conditions such as restless legs syndrome and migraine. Its anatomical organization, however, remains largely unknown in the non-human primate (NHP). We therefore characterized the anatomy of this pathway in the NHP.In situ hybridization of spinal dopamine receptors showed that D1 receptor mRNA is absent while D2 and D5 receptor mRNAs are mainly expressed in the dorsal horn and D3 receptor mRNA in both the dorsal and ventral horns. Unilateral injections of the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold (FG) into the cervical spinal enlargement labeled A11 hypothalamic neurons quasi-exclusively among dopamine areas. Detailed immunohistochemical analysis suggested that these FG-labeled A11 neurons are tyrosine hydroxylase-positive but dopa-decarboxylase and dopamine transporter-negative, suggestive of a L-DOPAergic nucleus. Stereological cell count of A11 neurons revealed that this group is composed by 4002±501 neurons per side. A 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intoxication with subsequent development of a parkinsonian syndrome produced a 50% neuronal cell loss in the A11 group.The diencephalic A11 area could be the major source of L-DOPA in the NHP spinal cord, where it may play a role in the modulation of sensorimotor integration through D2 and D3 receptors either directly or indirectly via dopamine formation in spinal dopa-decarboxylase-positives cells."
https://openalex.org/W2073704799,"Background How do national-level actions overlap with global priorities for conservation? Answering this question is especially important in countries with high and unique biological diversity like Colombia. Global biodiversity schemes provide conservation guidance at a large scale, while national governments gazette land for protection based on a combination of criteria at regional or local scales. Information on how a protected area network represents global and national conservation priorities is crucial for finding gaps in coverage and for future expansion of the system. Methodology/Principal Findings We evaluated the agreement of Colombia's protected area network with global conservation priorities, and the extent to which the network reflects the country's biomes, species richness, and common environmental and physical conditions. We used this information to identify priority biomes for conservation. We find the dominant strategy in Colombia has been a proactive one, allocating the highest proportion of protected land on intact, difficult to access and species rich areas like the Amazon. Threatened and unique areas are disproportionately absent from Colombia's protected lands. We highlight six biomes in Colombia as conservation priorities that should be considered in any future expansion of Colombia's protected area network. Two of these biomes have less than 3% of their area protected and more than 70% of their area transformed for human use. One has less than 3% protected and high numbers of threatened vertebrates. Three biomes fall in both categories. Conclusions Expansion of Colombia's Protected Area Network should consider the current representativeness of the network. We indicate six priority biomes that can contribute to improving the representation of threatened species and biomes in Colombia."
https://openalex.org/W1966840077,"Vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption through the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) in renal collecting ducts maintains body water homeostasis. Vasopressin activates PKA, which phosphorylates AQP2, and this phosphorylation event is required to increase the water permeability and water reabsorption of the collecting duct cells. It has been established that the phosphorylation of AQP2 induces its apical membrane insertion, rendering the cell water-permeable. However, whether this phosphorylation regulates the water permeability of this channel still remains unclear. To clarify the role of AQP2 phosphorylation in water permeability, we expressed recombinant human AQP2 in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, purified it, and reconstituted it into proteoliposomes. AQP2 proteins not reconstituted into liposomes were removed by fractionating on density step gradients. AQP2-reconstituted liposomes were then extruded through polycarbonate filters to obtain unilamellar vesicles. PKA phosphorylation significantly increased the osmotic water permeability of AQP2-reconstituted liposomes. We then examined the roles of AQP2 phosphorylation at Ser-256 and Ser-261 in the regulation of water permeability using phosphorylation mutants reconstituted into proteoliposomes. The water permeability of the non-phosphorylation-mimicking mutant S256A-AQP2 and non-phosphorylated WT-AQP2 was similar, and that of the phosphorylation-mimicking mutant S256D-AQP2 and phosphorylated WT-AQP2 was similar. The water permeability of S261A-AQP2 and S261D-AQP2 was similar to that of non-phosphorylated WT-AQP2. This study shows that PKA phosphorylation of AQP2 at Ser-256 enhances its water permeability."

https://openalex.org/W2037158481,"Background The human visual system does not treat all parts of an image equally: the central segments of an image, which fall on the fovea, are processed with a higher resolution than the segments that fall in the visual periphery. Even though the differences between foveal and peripheral resolution are large, these differences do not usually disrupt our perception of seamless visual space. Here we examine a motion stimulus in which the shift from foveal to peripheral viewing creates a dramatic spatial/temporal discontinuity. Methodology/Principal Findings The stimulus consists of a descending disk (global motion) with an internal moving grating (local motion). When observers view the disk centrally, they perceive both global and local motion (i.e., observers see the disk's vertical descent and the internal spinning). When observers view the disk peripherally, the internal portion appears stationary, and the disk appears to descend at an angle. The angle of perceived descent increases as the observer views the stimulus from further in the periphery. We examine the first- and second-order information content in the display with the use of a three-dimensional Fourier analysis and show how our results can be used to describe perceived spatial/temporal discontinuities in real-world situations. Conclusions/Significance The perceived shift of the disk's direction in the periphery is consistent with a model in which foveal processing separates first- and second-order motion information while peripheral processing integrates first- and second-order motion information. We argue that the perceived distortion may influence real-world visual observations. To this end, we present a hypothesis and analysis of the perception of the curveball and rising fastball in the sport of baseball. The curveball is a physically measurable phenomenon: the imbalance of forces created by the ball's spin causes the ball to deviate from a straight line and to follow a smooth parabolic path. However, the curveball is also a perceptual puzzle because batters often report that the flight of the ball undergoes a dramatic and nearly discontinuous shift in position as the ball nears home plate. We suggest that the perception of a discontinuous shift in position results from differences between foveal and peripheral processing."
https://openalex.org/W2010411596,"Secretion of the Escherichia coli toxin hemolysin A (HlyA) is catalyzed by the membrane protein complex HlyB-HlyD-TolC and requires a secretion sequence located within the last 60 amino acids of HlyA. The Hly translocator complex exports a variety of passenger proteins when fused N-terminal to this secretion sequence. However, not all fusions are secreted efficiently. Here, we demonstrate that the maltose binding protein (MalE) lacking its natural export signal and fused to the HlyA secretion signal is poorly secreted by the Hly system. We anticipated that folding kinetics might be limiting secretion, and we therefore introduced the “folding” mutation Y283D. Indeed this mutant fusion protein was secreted at a much higher level. This level was further enhanced by the introduction of a second MalE folding mutation (V8G or A276G). Secretion did not require the molecular chaperone SecB. Folding analysis revealed that all mutations reduced the refolding rate of the substrate, whereas the unfolding rate was unaffected. Thus, the efficiency of secretion by the Hly system is dictated by the folding rate of the substrate. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusion proteins defective in export can be engineered for secretion while still retaining function.

We anticipated that folding kinetics might be limiting secretion, and we therefore introduced the “folding” mutation Y283D. Indeed this mutant fusion protein was secreted at a much higher level. This level was further enhanced by the introduction of a second MalE folding mutation (V8G or A276G). Secretion did not require the molecular chaperone SecB. Folding analysis revealed that all mutations reduced the refolding rate of the substrate, whereas the unfolding rate was unaffected. Thus, the efficiency of secretion by the Hly system is dictated by the folding rate of the substrate. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusion proteins defective in export can be engineered for secretion while still retaining function."
https://openalex.org/W2110569927,"Background Francisella tularensis is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen and the etiological agent of tularemia. The subspecies F. tularensis tularensis is especially virulent for humans when inhaled and respiratory tularemia is associated with high mortality if not promptly treated. A live vaccine strain (LVS) derived from the less virulent holarctica subspecies confers incomplete protection against aerosol challenge with subsp. tularensis. Moreover, correlates of protection have not been established for LVS. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study we compare molecular immune responses elicited by LVS and two defined deletion mutants of clinical subsp. tularensis strain, SCHU S4, that confer enhanced protection in a mouse model. BALB/c mice were immunized intradermally then challenged with an aerosol of SCHU S4 six weeks later. Changes in the levels of a selected panel of cytokines and chemokines were examined in the lungs, spleens, and sera of vaccinated and challenged mice. Mostly, increased cytokine and chemokine levels correlated with increased bacterial burden. However, after adjusting for this variable, immunization with either of the two Schu S4 mutants resulted in higher levels of several pulmonary cytokines, versus those resulting after LVS immunization, including IL-17. Moreover, treatment of mice immunized with ΔclpB with anti-IL-17 antibodies post-challenge enhanced lung infection. Conclusions/Significance This is the first report characterizing local and systemic cytokine and chemokine responses in mice immunized with vaccines with different efficacies against aerosol challenge with virulent F. tularensis subsp. tularensis. It shows that increases in the levels of most of these immunomodulators, including those known to be critical for protective immunity, do not superficially correlate with protection unless adjusted for the effects of bacterial burden. Additionally, several cytokines were selectively suppressed in the lungs of naïve mice, suggesting that one mechanism of vaccine action is to overcome this pathogen-induced immunosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W2111301221,"Background Abundant fossils from the Ediacaran and Cambrian showing cnidarian grade grossly suggest that cnidarian diversification occurred earlier than that of other eumetazoans. However, fossils of possible soft-bodied polyps are scanty and modern corals are dated back only to the Middle Triassic, although molecular phylogenetic results support the idea that anthozoans represent the first major branch of the Cnidaria. Because of difficulties in taxonomic assignments owing to imperfect preservation of fossil cnidarian candidates, little is known about forms ancestral to those of living groups. Methods and Findings We have analyzed the soft-bodied polypoid microfossils Eolympia pediculata gen. et sp. nov. from the lowest Cambrian Kuanchuanpu Formation in southern China by scanning electron microscopy and computer-aided microtomography after isolating fossils from sedimentary rocks by acetic acid maceration. The fossils, about a half mm in body size, are preserved with 18 mesenteries including directives bilaterally arranged, 18 tentacles and a stalk-like pedicle. The pedicle suggests a sexual life cycle, while asexual reproduction by transverse fission also is inferred by circumferential grooves on the body column. Conclusions The features found in the present fossils fall within the morphological spectrum of modern Hexacorallia excluding Ceriantharia, and thus Eolympia pediculata could be a stem member for this group. The fossils also demonstrate that basic features characterizing modern hexacorallians such as bilateral symmetry and the reproductive system have deep roots in the Early Cambrian."
https://openalex.org/W2160968456,"Cooperation is of utmost importance to society as a whole, but is often challenged by individual self-interests. While game theory has studied this problem extensively, there is little work on interactions within and across groups with different preferences or beliefs. Yet, people from different social or cultural backgrounds often meet and interact. This can yield conflict, since behavior that is considered cooperative by one population might be perceived as non-cooperative from the viewpoint of another. To understand the dynamics and outcome of the competitive interactions within and between groups, we study game-dynamical replicator equations for multiple populations with incompatible interests and different power (be this due to different population sizes, material resources, social capital, or other factors). These equations allow us to address various important questions: For example, can cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma be promoted, when two interacting groups have different preferences? Under what conditions can costly punishment, or other mechanisms, foster the evolution of norms? When does cooperation fail, leading to antagonistic behavior, conflict, or even revolutions? And what incentives are needed to reach peaceful agreements between groups with conflicting interests? Our detailed quantitative analysis reveals a large variety of interesting results, which are relevant for society, law and economics, and have implications for the evolution of language and culture as well."

Nature. 1955; 176: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain within the mitochondrial membrane was proposed a half-century ago. In this model, the respiratory complexes are assembled into multicomplex structures, supercomplexes. Supercomplexes are capable of substrate channeling and thus facilitate transfer of electrons from one complex to the next (2Bianchi C. Genova M.L. Parenti Castelli G. Lenaz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36562-36569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the random collision model (3Hackenbrock C.R. Chazotte B. Gupte S.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 331-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), which proposes that the complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane as separate entities. Individual complexes are functionally connected to each other by the small, mobile electron carriers, coenzyme Q, and cytochrome c. The random collision model became more generally accepted as kinetic studies demonstrated homogenous pool behavior of coenzyme Q (4Kröger A. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 39: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), rates of electron transfer that did not require substrate channeling, and the successful isolation of individual respiratory complexes that were enzymatically active (3Hackenbrock C.R.

From these findings, it has been suggested that fully assembled complex III, functional or not, is required for the assembly and stability of complex I. Notably, no structural mutations in ISP or cytochrome c1 have been reported in animals. However, complex III deficiencies in human patients are caused by mutations in BCS1L (23Fernandez-Vizarra E.

There are no reports that defects in complex III can affect the function of fully assembled complex I without decreasing the amount of complex I.In Caenorhabditis elegans, two different complex III mutants confer intriguing phenotypes. isp-1 changes a highly conserved amino acid (P225S) residue in the head domain of ISP. Hekimi and co-workers (28Feng J. Bussière F. Hekimi S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) reported that isp-1 exhibits low oxygen consumption, decreased sensitivity to reactive oxygen species, extended lifespan, and delayed embryonic development. A mutation (ctb-1) in a complex III subunit cytochrome b, A170V, was discovered as a suppressor of a delayed development phenotype of isp-1. isp-1;ctb-1 shows an improvement in the rate of development compared with isp-1 (28Feng J. Bussière F. Hekimi S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). However, the molecular cause of this improved phenotype is unknown.We show here that a structural defect of complex III, caused by a mutation in ISP, can reduce the amount of fully assembled complex I without a reduction in the amount of fully assembled complex III. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ctb-1 can decrease complex I function without decreasing either the amount of fully assembled complex I or the distribution of complex I in supercomplexes. In addition, we show that the improved whole animal phenotypes of isp-1;ctb-1 compared with isp-1 alone do not stem from improved complex III function. Rather salutary allosteric effects on complex I result from the introduction of a second mutated subunit into complex III. In addition, this double mutant heightens the weakened association of supercomplex I·II·IV such that the composition of supercomplexes is altered on BNGs. The detailed mechanisms of complex I and III interdependence seen in a model system indicate that supercomplexes play a major role in modulating intrinsic enzymatic activities of complexes I and III. The complexity of the interdependence between components of the ETC has important implications for the diagnosis of patients with defects in multiple complexes.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that, in the nematode, primary changes in complex III can significantly affect the function of complex I. This can occur without decreasing the amount of complex III (isp-1) or the amount or the distribution of complex I in supercomplexes (ctb-1).Originally, we hypothesized that in isp-1;ctb-1, ctb-1 would suppress the slow development of isp-1 (28Feng J. Bussière F. Hekimi S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) by restoring complex III activity. Surprisingly, compared with isp-1, complex III activity in isp-1;ctb-1 was not improved by the suppressor mutation ctb-1. Rather, complex I activity was improved, which was the only improvement in mitochondrial function that we could measure. Our results indicate that an allosteric interaction between complexes I and III is the basis of ctb-1 suppression of the severe developmental phenotype of isp-1.Development from L3 to L4 and L4 to adult is accompanied by a dramatic increase in mitochondrial DNA content (38Bratic I. Hench J. Henriksson J. Antebi A. Bürglin T.R. Trifunovic A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 39Tsang W.Y. Lemire B.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which has been linked to increased cellular energy expenditure (39Tsang W.Y. Lemire B.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). isp-1 and isp-1;ctb-1 spent twice the time in L3–L4 as did ctb-1 or wild type, implying that the mitochondrial deficiencies in isp-1 and isp-1;ctb-1 are each more severe than in ctb-1. These results were corroborated by decreased fecundity in isp-1 and isp-1;ctb-1. Interestingly, although ctb-1 developed at the same rate and laid a similar number of eggs as wild type, (supplemental Table 1), its maximum rate of egg laying was 1 day later than wild type. This was the only whole animal phenotype observed in ctb-1, which we interpret as a mild form of mitochondrial deficiency.The isp-1 allele we studied is a serine substitution of a highly conserved proline, which is located in the head domain of ISP (18Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). This proline residue has been shown to be crucial for the secondary structure of the [2Fe-2S] cluster, for it creates an inward folding of the backbone of the Rieske head domain immediately preceding strand β5 (40Iwata S. Saynovits M. Link T.A. Michel H. Structure. 1996; 4: 567-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Such an amino acid change could negatively affect redox properties of the ISP by altering the position of the [2Fe-2S] residues and significantly impede complex III activity. Furthermore, a P146L substitution (a position that is equivalent to the isp-1 allele of the worm in our study) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was found to alter the midpoint potential of the [2Fe-2S] cluster (41Gatti D.L. Meinhardt S.W. Ohnishi T. Tzagoloff A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was not unexpected to observe a large decrease in complex III activity of the isp-1 mutant. isp-1(qm150) is the first example of a defect in the ISP itself that affects complex III function in animals. All of the complex III deficiencies in animals, which are associated with the ISP, are reportedly caused by the mutations of BCS1L (23Fernandez-Vizarra E. Bugiani M. Goffrini P. Carrara F. Farina L. Procopio E. Donati A. Uziel G. Ferrero I. Zeviani M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 1241-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24de Lonlay P. Valnot I. Barrientos A. Gorbatyuk M. Tzagoloff A.

J. Med. Genet. A. 2003; 121A: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), a chaperone protein involved in ISP synthesis.The ctb-1 mutation is a conservative alanine to valine substitution at the N-terminal of helix αD of cytochrome b that is adjacent to the docking site (helix αC, helix αcd1, and loop EF) of the Rieske head domain during electron transfer (18Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The mutated alanine is not a highly conserved residue and may not significantly alter the conformation of cytochrome b. Thus, it is not surprising that the decrease in complex III activity in ctb-1 was not as dramatic as in isp-1. In addition, the locations of the ctb-1 and isp-1 mutations are not close (18Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 19Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar) and not predicted to directly interact. Therefore, it may not be surprising that the two mutations do not combine to repair complex III function. All complex III mutants had normal amounts of fully assembled complex III but decreased complex III activity, including the conservative change in ctb-1, which significantly affected complex III function.Only isp-1 decreased the amount of fully assembled complex I, which undoubtedly led to its decreased complex I activity compared with N2. Complex I activity in isp-1;ctb-1 is decreased relative to N2 despite having normal amounts of complex I. However, we have shown that complex I is normally more active in the I·III·IV supercomplex than in the I·III form, as in bovine heart (37Schäfer E. Seelert H. Reifschneider N.H. Krause F. Dencher N.A. Vonck J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15370-15375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, in the double mutant, the decreased amount of supercomplex I·III·IV relative to supercomplex I·III is likely responsible for the decreased complex I activity, as is the case for complex IV mutations in C. elegans (32Suthammarak W. Yang Y.Y. Morgan P.G. Sedensky M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6425-6435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It most likely represents a increase of the detrimental effect of ctb-1 on complex IV binding within the supercomplex (see below). Nevertheless, the increased amount of total complex I in the double mutant is sufficient to improve complex I function compared with isp-1 alone.ctb-1 has decreased complex I activity despite a wild type distribution of supercomplex I·III and I·III·IV and a normal amount of complex I. Therefore, ctb-1 negatively affected complex I in its most active form, the I·III·IV supercomplex. The simplest explanation may be that this mutation changes the conformation of the supercomplex I·III·IV such that complex IV is less tightly bound to the supercomplex, reducing complex I activity toward enzymatic rates of its I·III form. If so, the increased proportion of supercomplex I·III relative to I·III·IV in isp-1;ctb-1 may be a reflection of this effect of ctb-1 in the double mutant and the reason that the activity in the double mutant was approximately the same as in ctb-1.We hypothesized that if complex III altered interactions between components of the I·III·IV supercomplex in this manner, we could detect an increased vulnerability of the supercomplex to disassociation. Both complex III mutants lost complex IV from supercomplexes (S1–S4) more readily than the wild type. In addition, S4 was partially dissociated into smaller supercomplexes whose molecular weights were comparable to S3, S2, and S1 suggesting, as we originally inferred, that S4 was supercomplex I·III·IV4 containing four copies of complex IV. The wild type supercomplex resisted dissociation relative to either isp-1;ctb-1 and ctb-1, suggesting that these two mutations produce conformational changes that disrupt supercomplex integrity.How can we link the finding that complex III mutations alter supercomplexes such that complex IV loosens its grip on supercomplex I·III·IV and decreases complex I activity? According to a current three-dimensional map of supercomplex I·III·IV, complex III and IV saddle the membranous arm of complex I (37Schäfer E. Seelert H. Reifschneider N.H. Krause F. Dencher N.A.

NADH·coenzyme Q reductase in the matrix arm provides the driving force for proton pumping via conformational coupling (43Efremov R.G. Baradaran R. Sazanov L.A.

Mutations in the homologues of ND subunits in the membranous arm of complex I, which form a core of the proton-pumping machinery, result in decreased complex I activity but normal NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity (46Kao M.C.

The relaxed interaction between complex IV and other components of the supercomplexes in the mutants may lead to an imperfect conformation and dysfunction of the proton-pumping module, which then impedes NADH·coenzyme Q reductase in the matrix arm. A similar logic may explain how complex I in wild type supercomplex I·III is not as active as complex I in wild type supercomplex I·III·IV.As expected, complex III defects affected both complex I and complex II-dependent respiration; complex IV respiration was increased in all mutants, most dramatically in isp-1 and isp-1;ctb-1, even though the amount of complex IV appeared unchanged in these mutants. Cytochrome c oxidase controls mitochondrial energy metabolism (50Kadenbach B. Frank V. Rieger T. Napiwotzki J. Mol.

Biochem. 1998; 252: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A low ATP/ADP ratio, as is expected in the complex III mutants, may increase complex IV driven respiration. However, complex IV activity in ETC assays was not significantly increased in complex III mutants compared with wild type. Because the mitochondrial membranes are solubilized in ETC assays, ATP/ADP differences between strains are eliminated. A recent study by Yang and Hekimi (53Yang W. Hekimi S. Aging Cell. 2010; 9: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) demonstrated decreased enzymatic activities of complexes I–III and complexes II–III in isp-1, although rates of complexes II–III were depressed more than complexes I–III. This is qualitatively different than our data. They did not measure complex III activity per se or complex I activity, and all rates were normalized to citrate synthase. It is difficult to compare techniques between our studies and those of Yang and Hekimi (53Yang W. Hekimi S. Aging Cell. 2010; 9: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), so the differences between them are not fully interpretable.We also identified three unique bands in the BNGs of isp-1 that may represent intermediates in complex I assembly or degradation. A current model of supercomplex assembly proposes that the subcomplex Iβ of complex I associates first with the partially assembled complex III and IV, leading to a module upon which the mature supercomplex forms (36Lazarou M. Thorburn D.R. Ryan M.T. McKenzie M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). ISP-A represents a nearly complete subcomplex consisting of the P and Q modules already combined with ND4/ND5 intermediates and partially assembled complex III and IV. This suggests that the mutation in the ISP halted supercomplex maturation at the final step prior to incorporation of the NADH-oxidase module (N module). In turn, two smaller intermediates accumulate, ISP-B (an 830-kDa intermediate P/Q complex, with partially assembled complexes III and IV), and ISP-C (likely a 400-kDa intermediate consisting of the Q module and an early form of P, the membranous arm). Even though the bands we see correspond well to proposed assembly modules of complex I, we have not ruled out that they may represent steps in degradation of a supercomplex.The physical association between complexes I and III is thought to involve ISP of complex III and the NDUFS2 and NDUFS4 subunits of the Q module of complex I. Missense mutations in those complex I subunit decreased levels of complex III (54Ugalde C. Janssen R.J. van den Heuvel L.P. Smeitink J.A. Nijtmans L.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Because the mutation in isp-1(qm150) alters an amino acid in the highly mobile peripheral domain of the protein, it is difficult to envision how this might alter a complex I-III interaction. However, such a change could easily affect assembly or stability of the supercomplex resulting in misaligned complexes. The appearance of abnormal subcomplexes in the isp-1 BNGs supports this model.It is intriguing that ctb-1 improves complex I function in an isp-1 background without affecting complex III function. The effects of complex III subunits on complex I represent an allosteric mechanism wherein subunits of the catalytic core can regulate supercomplex assembly (isp-1), ratios of supercomplexes (isp-1;ctb-1) or complex I electron flow in the face of normal amounts and profiles of supercomplexes (ctb-1). This is the first report of a complex III mutation that can affect complex I in this manner.This study provides a new insight into the role of supercomplexes in ETC defects. Complexes I and III have intricate structural and allosteric interactions revealing a complicated inter-relatedness between different complexes of the mitochondrial respirasome (9Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 15Schägger H. de Coo R. Bauer M.F. Hofmann S. Godinot C. Brandt U. J. Biol.

Diagnosis of patients with mitochondrial disease, which is clearly problematic, must take into account the myriad of consequences in the ETC that may result from a single mutation. Clearly, a defect in a single subunit of the ETC can have wide ranging and unanticipated effects on mitochondrial function. IntroductionA solid-state model (1Chance B. Williams G.R. Nature. 1955; 176: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain within the mitochondrial membrane was proposed a half-century ago. In this model, the respiratory complexes are assembled into multicomplex structures, supercomplexes. Supercomplexes are capable of substrate channeling and thus facilitate transfer of electrons from one complex to the next (2Bianchi C. Genova M.L. Parenti Castelli G. Lenaz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36562-36569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the random collision model (3Hackenbrock C.R. Chazotte B. Gupte S.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 331-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), which proposes that the complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane as separate entities. Individual complexes are functionally connected to each other by the small, mobile electron carriers, coenzyme Q, and cytochrome c. The random collision model became more generally accepted as kinetic studies demonstrated homogenous pool behavior of coenzyme Q (4Kröger A. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Bio"

Vif functions to preserve viral infectivity by triggering the degradation of huA3F but not rhesus macaque A3F (rhA3F). Here, we use a combination of deletions, chimeras, and systematic mutagenesis between huA3F and rhA3F to identify Glu324 as a critical determinant of huA3F susceptibility to HIV-1 Vif-mediated degradation. A structural model of the C-terminal deaminase domain of huA3F indicates that Glu324 is a surface residue within the α4 helix adjacent to residues corresponding to other known Vif susceptibility determinants in APOBEC3G and APOBEC3H. This structural clustering suggests that Vif may bind a conserved surface present in multiple APOBEC3 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2114895218,"Background Regulatory T-cells (Tregs), characterized as CD4+CD25hi T-cells expressing FOXP3, play a crucial role in controlling healthy immune development during early immune maturation. Recently, FOXP3 demethylation was suggested to be a novel marker for natural Tregs in adults. In cord blood, the role and function of Tregs and its demethylation is poorly understood. We assessed FOXP3 demethylation in cord blood in relation to previously used Treg markers such as CD4+CD25hi, FOXP3 mRNA, protein expression, and suppressive Treg function. Methodology Cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) were isolated from 70 healthy neonates, stimulated for 3 days with the microbial stimulus lipid A (LpA), and allergen Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Derp1). Tregs (CD4+CD25hi, intracellular, mRNA FOXP3 expression, isolated cells), DNA methylation of the FOXP3-locus and suppressive Treg function were assessed. Principal Findings Demethylation of FOXP3 in whole blood was specific for isolated CD4+CD25hi Tregs. Demethylation of FOXP3 was positively correlated with unstimulated and LpA-stimulated FOXP3 mRNA-expression (p≤0.05), and CD4+CD25hi T-cells (p≤0.03). Importantly, increased FOXP3 demethylation correlated with more efficient suppressive capacity of Tregs (r = 0.72, p = 0.005). Furthermore, FOXP3 demethylation was positively correlated with Th2 cytokines (IL-5, IL-13) following LpA-stimulation (p = 0.006/0.04), with Th2 and IL-17 following Derp1+LpA-stimulations (p≤0.009), but not Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ). Conclusions FOXP3 demethylation reliable quantifies Tregs in cord blood. FOXP3 demethylation corresponds well with the suppressive potential of Tregs. The resulting strict correlation with functionally suppressive Tregs and the relative ease of measurement render it into a valuable novel marker for large field studies assessing Tregs as qualitative marker indicative of functional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2046584040,"Hepatic steatosis can progress to the clinical condition of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a precursor of more serious liver diseases. The novel PKC isoforms δ and ε are activated by lipid metabolites and have been implicated in lipid-induced hepatic disease. Using a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) dietary model of NASH, we addressed the question of whether hepatic PKCδ and PKCε are activated. With progression from steatosis to steatohepatitis, there was activation and increased PKCδ protein content coincident with hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress parameters. To examine whether similar changes could be induced in vitro, McA-RH 7777 (McA) hepatoma cells were used. We observed that McA cells stored triglyceride and released alanine aminotransferase (ALT) when treated with MCD medium in the presence of fatty acids. Further, MCD medium with palmitic acid, but not oleic or linoleic acids, maximally activated PKCδ and stimulated ER stress. In PKCδ knockdown McA cells, MCD/fatty acid medium-induced ALT release and ER stress induction were completely blocked, but triglyceride storage was not. In addition, a reduction in the uptake of propidium iodide and the number of apoptotic nuclei and a significant increase in cell viability and DNA content were observed in PKCδ knockdown McA cells incubated in MCD medium with palmitic acid. Our studies show that PKCδ activation and protein levels are elevated in an animal model of steatohepatitis, which was recapitulated in a cell model, supporting the conclusion that PKCδ plays a role in ALT release, the ER stress signal, and cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2092878622,"The bi-enzymatic system of cytochrome P450 (CYP, a hemoprotein) and cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR, a diflavoenzyme) mediate the redox metabolism of diverse indigenous and xenobiotic molecules in various cellular and organ systems, using oxygen and NADPH. Curiously, when a 1:1 ratio is seen to be optimal for metabolism, the ubiquitous CYP:CPR distribution ratio is 10 to 100:1 or higher. Further, the NADPH equivalents consumed in these in vitro or in situ assemblies usually far exceeded the amount of substrate metabolized. We aimed to find the rationale to explain for these two oddities. We report here that CPR is capable of activating molecular oxygen on its own merit, generating diffusible reduced oxygen species (DROS). Also, in the first instance for a flavoprotein, CPR is shown to deplete peroxide via diffusible radical mediated process, thereby leading to the formation of water (but without significant evolution of oxygen). We also quantitatively demonstrate that the rate of oxygen activation and peroxide depletion by CPR accounts for the major reactivity in the CYP+CPR mixture. We show unambiguously that CPR is able to regulate the concentration of diffusible reduced oxygen species in the reaction milieu. These findings point out that CPR mediated processes are bound to be energetically 'wasteful' and potentially 'hazardous' owing to the unavoidable nature of the CPR to generate and deplete DROS. Hence, we can understand that CPR is distributed at low densities in cells. Some of the activities that were primarily attributed to the heme-center of CYP are now established to be a facet of the flavins of CPR. The current approach of modeling drugs to minimize ""uncoupling"" on the basis of erstwhile hypothesis stands questionable, considering the ideas brought forth in this work."
https://openalex.org/W2102224038,"Background The emergence and rapid spread of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1pdm) in humans highlights the importance of enhancing the capability of existing influenza surveillance systems with tools for rapid identification of emerging and re-emerging viruses. One of the new approaches is the RT-PCR electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) technology, which is based on analysis of base composition (BC) of RT-PCR amplicons from influenza “core” genes. Combination of the BC signatures represents a “genomic print” of an influenza A virus. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, 757 samples collected between 2006 and 2009 were tested, including 302 seasonal H1N1, 171 H3N2, 7 swine triple reassortants, and 277 H1N1pdm viruses. Of the 277 H1N1pdm samples, 209 were clinical specimens (throat, nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal washes, blood and sputum). BC signatures for the clinical specimen from one of the first cases of the 2009 pandemic, A/California/04/2009, confirmed it as an unusual, previously unrecognized influenza A virus, with “core” genes related to viruses of avian, human and swine origins. Subsequent analysis of additional 276 H1N1pdm samples revealed that they shared the genomic print of A/California/04/2009, which differed from those of North American swine triple reassortant viruses, seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 and other viruses tested. Moreover, this assay allowed distinction between “core” genes of co-circulating groups of seasonal H1N1, such as clades 2B, 2C, and their reassortants with dual antiviral resistance to adamantanes and oseltamivir. Conclusions/Significance The RT-PCR/ESI-MS assay is a broad range influenza identification tool that can be used directly on clinical specimens for rapid and accurate detection of influenza virus genes. The assay differentiates the H1N1pdm from seasonal and other nonhuman hosts viruses. Although not a diagnostic tool, this assay demonstrates its usefulness and robustness in influenza virus surveillance and detection of novel and unusual viruses with previously unseen genomic prints."
https://openalex.org/W2043668845,"Several studies have shown the protective effects of dietary enrichment of various lipids in several late-onset animal models of Alzheimer Disease (AD); however, none of the studies has determined which structure within a lipid determines its detrimental or beneficial effects on AD. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) shows that saturated fatty acids (SFAs), upstream omega-3 FAs, and arachidonic acid (AA) resulted in significantly higher secretion of both Aβ 40 and 42 peptides compared with long chain downstream omega-3 and monounsaturated FAs (MUFA). Their distinct detrimental action is believed to be due to a structural template found in their fatty acyl chains that lack SFAs, upstream omega-3 FAs, and AA. Immunoblotting experiments and use of APP-C99-transfected COS-7 cells suggest that FA-driven altered production of Aβ is mediated through γ-secretase cleavage of APP. An early-onset AD transgenic mouse model expressing the double-mutant form of human amyloid precursor protein (APP); Swedish (K670N/M671L) and Indiana (V717F), corroborated in vitro findings by showing lower levels of Aβ and amyloid plaques in the brain, when they were fed a low fat diet enriched in DHA. Our work contributes to the clarification of aspects of structure-activity relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2027704646,"Background Malaria is one of the major human infectious diseases in many endemic countries. For prevention of the spread of malaria, it is necessary to develop an early, sensitive, accurate and conventional diagnosis system. Methods and Findings A cell microarray chip was used to detect for malaria-infected erythrocytes. The chip, with 20,944 microchambers (105 µm width and 50 µm depth), was made from polystyrene, and the formation of monolayers of erythrocytes in the microchambers was observed. Cultured Plasmodium falciparum strain 3D7 was used to examine the potential of the cell microarray chip for malaria diagnosis. An erythrocyte suspension in a nuclear staining dye, SYTO 59, was dispersed on the chip surface, followed by 10 min standing to allow the erythrocytes to settle down into the microchambers. About 130 erythrocytes were accommodated in each microchamber, there being over 2,700,000 erythrocytes in total on a chip. A microarray scanner was employed to detect any fluorescence-positive erythrocytes within 5 min, and 0.0001% parasitemia could be detected. To examine the contamination by leukocytes of purified erythrocytes from human blood, 20 µl of whole blood was mixed with 10 ml of RPMI 1640, and the mixture was passed through a leukocyte isolation filter. The eluted portion was centrifuged at 1,000×g for 2 min, and the pellet was dispersed in 1.0 ml of medium. SYTO 59 was added to the erythrocyte suspension, followed by analysis on a cell microarray chip. Similar accommodation of cells in the microchambers was observed. The number of contaminating leukocytes was less than 1 on a cell microarray chip. Conclusion The potential of the cell microarray chip for the detection of malaria-infected erythrocytes was shown, it offering 10–100 times higher sensitivity than that of conventional light microscopy and easy operation in 15 min with purified erythrocytes."

The assignment into pre-treatment weight bands leads to drug doses (milligram per kilogram) that are lower than current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for some patients. Objectives The main aim of our study was to describe the baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes reported under RNTCP for registered childhood (age <15 years) TB patients in Delhi. Additionally, we compared the reported programmatic treatment completion rates between children treated as per WHO recommended anti-TB drug doses with those children treated with anti-TB drug doses below that recommended in WHO guidelines. Methods For this cross-sectional retrospective study, we reviewed programme records of all 1089 TB patients aged <15 years registered for TB treatment from January to June, 2008 in 6 randomly selected districts of Delhi. WHO disease classification and treatment outcome definitions are used by RNTCP, and these were extracted as reported in programme records. Results and Conclusions Among 1074 patients with records available, 651 (61%) were females, 122 (11%) were <5 years of age, 1000 (93%) were new cases, and 680 (63%) had extra-pulmonary TB (EP-TB)—most commonly peripheral lymph node disease [310 (46%)]. Among 394 pulmonary TB (PTB) cases, 165 (42%) were sputum smear-positive. The overall reported treatment completion rate was 95%. Similar reported treatment completion rates were found in all subgroups assessed, including those patients whose drug dosages were lower than that currently recommended by WHO. Further studies are needed to assess the reasons for the low proportion of under-5 years of age TB case notifications, address challenges in reaching all childhood TB patients by RNTCP, the accuracy of diagnosis, and the clinical validity of reported programme defined treatment completion."

Pinewood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, is an important invasive plant parasitic nematode in Asia. To have a comprehensive knowledge about miRNAs of the nematode is necessary for further in-depth study on roles of miRNAs in the ecological adaptation of the invasive species.Five small RNA libraries were constructed and sequenced by Illumina/Solexa deep-sequencing technology. A total of 810 miRNA candidates (49 conserved and 761 novel) were predicted by a computational pipeline, of which 57 miRNAs (20 conserved and 37 novel) encoded by 53 miRNA precursors were identified by experimental methods. Ten novel miRNAs were considered to be species-specific miRNAs of B. xylophilus. Comparison of expression profiles of miRNAs in the five small RNA libraries showed that many miRNAs exhibited obviously different expression levels in the third-stage dispersal juvenile and at a cold-stressed status. Most of the miRNAs exhibited obviously down-regulated expression in the dispersal stage. But differences among the three geographic libraries were not prominent. A total of 979 genes were predicted to be targets of these authentic miRNAs. Among them, seven heat shock protein genes were targeted by 14 miRNAs, and six FMRFamide-like neuropeptides genes were targeted by 17 miRNAs. A real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the mRNA expression levels of target genes.Basing on the fact that a negative correlation existed between the expression profiles of miRNAs and the mRNA expression profiles of their target genes (hsp, flp) by comparing those of the nematodes at a cold stressed status and a normal status, we suggested that miRNAs might participate in ecological adaptation and behavior regulation of the nematode. This is the first description of miRNAs in plant parasitic nematodes. The results provide a useful resource for further in-depth study on molecular regulation and evolution of miRNAs in plant parasitic nematodes."
https://openalex.org/W1971082758,"Memory for action is enhanced if individuals are allowed to perform the corresponding movements, compared to when they simply listen to them (enactment effect). Previous studies have shown that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have difficulties with processes involving the self, such as autobiographical memories and self performed actions. The present study aimed at assessing memory for action in Asperger Syndrome (AS). We investigated whether adults with AS would benefit from the enactment effect when recalling a list of previously performed items vs. items that were only visually and verbally experienced through three experimental tasks (Free Recall, Old/New Recognition and Source Memory). The results showed that while performance on Recognition and Source Memory tasks was preserved in individuals with AS, the enactment effect for self-performed actions was not consistently present, as revealed by the lower number of performed actions being recalled on the Free Recall test, as compared to adults with typical development. Subtle difficulties in encoding specific motor and proprioceptive signals during action execution in individuals with AS might affect retrieval of relevant personal episodic information. These disturbances might be associated to an impaired action monitoring system."
https://openalex.org/W2016742269,"Aquifex aeolicus, a hyperthermophilic and microaerophilic bacterium, obtains energy for growth from inorganic compounds alone. It was previously proposed that one of the respiratory pathways in this organism consists of the electron transfer from hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) to molecular oxygen. H(2)S is oxidized by the sulfide quinone reductase, a membrane-bound flavoenzyme, which reduces the quinone pool. We have purified and characterized a novel membrane-bound multienzyme supercomplex that brings together all the molecular components involved in this bioenergetic chain. Our results indicate that this purified structure consists of one dimeric bc(1) complex (complex III), one cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), and one or two sulfide quinone reductases as well as traces of the monoheme cytochrome c(555) and quinone molecules. In addition, this work strongly suggests that the cytochrome c oxidase in the supercomplex is a ba(3)-type enzyme. The supercomplex has a molecular mass of about 350 kDa and is enzymatically functional, reducing O(2) in the presence of the electron donor, H(2)S. This is the first demonstration of the existence of such a respirasome carrying a sulfide oxidase-oxygen reductase activity. Moreover, the kinetic properties of the sulfide quinone reductase change slightly when integrated in the supercomplex, compared with the free enzyme. We previously purified a complete respirasome involved in hydrogen oxidation and sulfur reduction from Aquifex aeolicus. Thus, two different bioenergetic pathways (sulfur reduction and sulfur oxidation) are organized in this bacterium as supramolecular structures in the membrane. A model for the energetic sulfur metabolism of Aquifex aeolicus is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1971846680,"Background Recently, several studies have reported Yokukansan (Tsumura TJ-54), a traditional Japanese medicine, as a potential new drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD, particularly in neuronal death. Therefore, we examined the effect of Yokukansan on ER stress-induced neurotoxicity and on familial AD-linked presenilin-1 mutation-associated cell death. Methods We employed the WST-1 assay and monitored morphological changes to evaluate cell viability following Yokukansan treatment or treatment with its components. Western blotting and PCR were used to observe the expression levels of GRP78/BiP, caspase-4 and C/EBP homologous protein. Results Yokukansan inhibited neuronal death during ER stress, with Cnidii Rhizoma (Senkyu), a component of Yokukansan, being particularly effective. We also showed that Yokukansan and Senkyu affect the unfolded protein response following ER stress and that these drugs inhibit the activation of caspase-4, resulting in the inhibition of ER stress-induced neuronal death. Furthermore, we found that the protective effect of Yokukansan and Senkyu against ER stress could be attributed to the ferulic acid content of these two drugs. Conclusions Our results indicate that Yokukansan, Senkyu and ferulic acid are protective against ER stress-induced neuronal cell death and may provide a possible new treatment for AD."

The risk of preeclampsia is reduced in women who smoke during pregnancy. The objective of this study was to investigate whether smoking affects concentrations of angiogenic factors (sFlt1, PlGF, and sEng) in women at high risk for developing preeclampsia.We performed a secondary analysis of serum samples from 993 high-risk women (chronic hypertension, diabetes, multifetal gestation, and previous preeclampsia) in a preeclampsia prevention trial. sFlt1, sEng and PlGF were measured in serum samples obtained at study entry, which was prior to initiation of aspirin (median 19.0 weeks' [interquartile range of 16.0-22.6 weeks']). Smoking status was determined by self-report.sFlt1 was not significantly different in smokers from any high-risk groups compared to their nonsmoking counterparts. PlGF was higher among smokers compared to nonsmokers among diabetic women (142.7 [77.4-337.3] vs 95.9 [48.5-180.7] pg/ml, p = 0.005) and women with a history of preeclampsia (252.2 [137.1-486.0] vs 152.2 [73.6-253.7] pg/ml, p = 0.001). sEng was lower in smokers with multifetal gestations (5.8 [4.6-6.5] vs 6.8 [5.5-8.7] ng/ml, p = 0.002) and trended lower among smokers with diabetes (4.9 [3.8-5.6] vs 5.3 [4.3-6.3] ng/ml, p = 0.05). Smoking was not associated with a lower incidence of preeclampsia in any of these groups.In certain high-risk groups, smoking is associated with changes in the concentrations of these factors towards a pro-angiogenic direction during early pregnancy; however, there was no apparent association between smoking and the development of preeclampsia in our cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2074239088,"Background Coat protein complex I (COPI) vesicles, coated by seven coatomer subunits, are mainly responsible for Golgi-to-ER transport. Silkworm posterior silkgland (PSG), a highly differentiated secretory tissue, secretes fibroin for silk production, but many physiological processes in the PSG cells await further investigation. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, to investigate the role of silkworm COPI, we cloned six silkworm COPI subunits (α,β,β′, δ, ε, and ζ-COP), determined their peak expression in day 2 in fifth-instar PSG, and visualized the localization of COPI, as a coat complex, with cis-Golgi. By dsRNA injection into silkworm larvae, we suppressed the expression of α-, β′- and γ-COP, and demonstrated that COPI subunits were required for PSG tube expansion. Knockdown of α-COP disrupted the integrity of Golgi apparatus and led to a narrower glandular lumen of the PSG, suggesting that silkworm COPI is essential for PSG tube expansion. Conclusions/Significance The initial characterization reveals the essential roles of silkworm COPI in PSG. Although silkworm COPI resembles the previously characterized coatomers in other organisms, some surprising findings require further investigation. Therefore, our results suggest the silkworm as a model for studying intracellular transport, and would facilitate the establishment of silkworm PSG as an efficient bioreactor."

These include very long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent, an analysis of the network of clusters found in multiple high-temperature unfolding simulations and a complete characterization of free-energy surfaces carried out using a structure-based potential at atomistic resolution and a combination of metadynamics and parallel tempering. Our results confirm that the monomer in solution is stable toward unfolding and show that at least two unfolding pathways exist. In our scenario, the formation of a hydrophobic core is a milestone in the folding process which must occur along all the routes that lead this protein towards its native state. Furthermore, the ensemble of folding pathways proposed here substantiates a rational drug design strategy based on inhibiting the folding of HIV–1 protease."
https://openalex.org/W2036095774,"Tumor Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) is potentially a very important therapeutic as it shows selectivity for inducing apoptosis in cancer cells whilst normal cells are refractory. TRAIL binding to its cognate receptors, Death Receptors-4 and -5, leads to recruitment of caspase-8 and classical activation of downstream effector caspases, leading to apoptosis. As with many drugs however, TRAIL's usefulness is limited by resistance, either innate or acquired. We describe here the development of a novel 384-well high-throughput screening (HTS) strategy for identifying potential TRAIL-sensitizing agents that act solely in a caspase-8 dependent manner. By utilizing a TRAIL resistant cell line lacking caspase-8 (NB7) compared to the same cells reconstituted with the wild-type protein, or with a catalytically inactive point mutant of caspase-8, we are able to identify compounds that act specifically through the caspase-8 axis, rather than through general toxicity. In addition, false positive hits can easily be ""weeded out"" in this assay due to their activity in cells lacking caspase-8-inducible activity. Screening of the library of pharmacologically active compounds (LOPAC) was performed as both proof-of-concept and to discover potential unknown TRAIL sensitizers whose mechanism is caspase-8 mediated. We identified known TRAIL sensitizers from the library and identified new compounds that appear to sensitize specifically through caspase-8. In sum, we demonstrate proof-of-concept and discovery of novel compounds with a screening strategy optimized for the detection of caspase-8 pathway-specific TRAIL sensitizers. This screen was performed in the 384-well format, but could easily be further miniaturized, allows easy identification of artifactual false positives, and is highly scalable to accommodate diverse libraries."
https://openalex.org/W2101308812,"Background The neural system of our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, is a topic of increasing research interest. However, electrophysiological examinations of neural activity during visual processing in awake chimpanzees are currently lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present report, skin-surface event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were measured while a fully awake chimpanzee observed photographs of faces and objects in two experiments. In Experiment 1, human faces and stimuli composed of scrambled face images were displayed. In Experiment 2, three types of pictures (faces, flowers, and cars) were presented. The waveforms evoked by face stimuli were distinguished from other stimulus types, as reflected by an enhanced early positivity appearing before 200 ms post stimulus, and an enhanced late negativity after 200 ms, around posterior and occipito-temporal sites. Face-sensitive activity was clearly observed in both experiments. However, in contrast to the robustly observed face-evoked N170 component in humans, we found that faces did not elicit a peak in the latency range of 150–200 ms in either experiment. Conclusions/Significance Although this pilot study examined a single subject and requires further examination, the observed scalp voltage patterns suggest that selective processing of faces in the chimpanzee brain can be detected by recording surface ERPs. In addition, this non-invasive method for examining an awake chimpanzee can be used to extend our knowledge of the characteristics of visual cognition in other primate species."
https://openalex.org/W2153881712,"Catch force maintenance in invertebrate smooth muscles is probably mediated by a force-bearing tether other than myosin cross-bridges between thick and thin filaments. The phosphorylation state of the mini-titin twitchin controls catch. The C-terminal phosphorylation site (D2) of twitchin with its flanking Ig domains forms a phosphorylation-sensitive complex with actin and myosin, suggesting that twitchin is the tether (Funabara, D., Osawa, R., Ueda, M., Kanoh, S., Hartshorne, D. J., and Watabe, S. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 18015–18020). Here we show that a region near the N terminus of twitchin also interacts with thick and thin filaments from Mytilus anterior byssus retractor muscles. Both a recombinant protein, including the D1 and DX phosphorylation sites with flanking 7th and 8th Ig domains, and a protein containing just the linker region bind to thin filaments with about a 1:1 mol ratio to actin and Kd values of 1 and 15 μm, respectively. Both proteins show a decrease in binding when phosphorylated. The unphosphorylated proteins increase force in partially activated permeabilized muscles, suggesting that they are sufficient to tether thick and thin filaments. There are two sites of thin filament interaction in this region because both a 52-residue peptide surrounding the DX site and a 47-residue peptide surrounding the D1 site show phosphorylation-dependent binding to thin filaments. The peptides relax catch force, confirming the region's central role in the mechanism of catch. The multiple sites of thin filament interaction in the N terminus of twitchin in addition to those in the C terminus provide an especially secure and redundant mechanical link between thick and thin filaments in catch. Catch force maintenance in invertebrate smooth muscles is probably mediated by a force-bearing tether other than myosin cross-bridges between thick and thin filaments. The phosphorylation state of the mini-titin twitchin controls catch. The C-terminal phosphorylation site (D2) of twitchin with its flanking Ig domains forms a phosphorylation-sensitive complex with actin and myosin, suggesting that twitchin is the tether (Funabara, D., Osawa, R., Ueda, M., Kanoh, S., Hartshorne, D.

The peptides relax catch force, confirming the region's central role in the mechanism of catch. The multiple sites of thin filament interaction in the N terminus of twitchin in addition to those in the C terminus provide an especially secure and redundant mechanical link between thick and thin filaments in catch. Catch is a mechanical state present in some invertebrate smooth muscles in which force output and high resistance to muscle lengthening are maintained for long periods of time with very low energy utilization. In the catch state, intracellular [Ca2+] is close to basal concentration (1Ishii N. Simpson A.W. Ashley C.C. Science. 1989; 243: 1367-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and redevelopment of force following unloading of the muscle is absent (2Jewell B.R. J. Physiol. 1959; 149: 154-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A hypothesis to explain the long term maintenance of catch force was based on a slowing of cycling of myosin attached to actin when activation waned (see Lowy and Millman (3Lowy J. Millman B.M. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1963; 246: 105-148Crossref Google Scholar)). On the other hand, Ruegg proposed that catch was maintained by an independent linkage among thick filaments, possibly mediated by paramyosin (4Ruegg J.C. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1961; 154: 224-249Crossref Google Scholar, 5Rüegg J.C. Physiol. Rev. 1971; 51: 201-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). As will be discussed below, much of the recent evidence supports the idea that catch results from an independent linkage between thick and thin filaments. Catch force is rapidly relaxed by stimulation of serotonergic nerves (6Twarog B.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1954; 44: 141-163Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar) that results in an increase in cAMP (7Cole R.A. Twarog B.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Comp.

(8Castellani L. Cohen C. Science. 1987; 235: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The protein that is phosphorylated by PKA during relaxation of catch force is twitchin, and it is the phosphorylation state of this protein that determines the presence or absence of the catch state at basal [Ca2+] (9Siegman M.J. Mooers S.U. Li C. Narayan S. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Watabe S. Hartshorne D.J. Butler T.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 655-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10Siegman M.J.

Twitchin is so named because Caenorhabditis elegans mutants that lack the protein show nearly constant twitching of body wall muscles (11Benian G.M. Kiff J.E. Neckelmann N. Moerman D.G. Waterston R.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Twitchin is a mini-titin that is composed of Ig and fibronectin domains as well as a kinase domain near the C terminus (11Benian G.M. Kiff J.E. Neckelmann N. Moerman D.G. Waterston R.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The domain organization of twitchin from Mytilus (12Funabara D. Watabe S. Mooers S.U. Narayan S. Dudas C. Hartshorne D.J.

The central portion of the molecule shares domain homology with part of the A band portion of titin, and twitchin is known to be associated with thick filaments in catch muscle (13Yamada A. Ishii N. Shimmen T. Takahashi K. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 124-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14Vibert P. Edelstein S.M. Castellani L. Elliott Jr., B.W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In vitro, twitchin is phosphorylated by PKA with a stoichiometry of about 3 mol of phosphate/mol of twitchin (15Funabara D. Kinoshita S. Watabe S. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The D1 phosphorylation site is located between the 7th and 8th Ig domain in the N-terminal part of the molecule, and the D2 site is near the C terminus between the 21st and 22nd Ig domain (12Funabara D. Watabe S. Mooers S.U. Narayan S. Dudas C. Hartshorne D.J. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. J. Biol.

Another site of phosphorylation shares a seven-amino acid sequence with the D1 site, is located in the same Ig linker region, and is referred to as DX (16Butler T.M. Siegman M.J. J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2010; 2010: 725207Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Also present in the same linker region as D1 and DX is a DFRXXL actin-binding motif (17Smith L. Su X. Lin P. Zhi G. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29433-29438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) similar to those that mediate the binding of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase to the thin filament (18Smith L.

Using an in vitro motility assay, Yamada et al. (20Yamada A. Yoshio M. Kojima H. Oiwa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) showed that mechanical aspects of the catch state can be demonstrated using thick filaments reconstituted from purified myosin, F-actin, and twitchin. They found, however, that little if any binding of twitchin to actin occurred in co-sedimentation experiments. On the other hand, Shelud'ko et al. (21Shelud'ko N.S. Matusovskaya G.G. Permyakova T.V. Matusovsky O.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 432: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) described significant twitchin-actin interactions that were greatly decreased when twitchin was phosphorylated. Their results supported our previous suggestion (22Butler T.M. Mooers S.U. Li C. Narayan S. Siegman M.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1904-1914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that twitchin might provide a mechanical link between thick and thin filaments. The idea that catch force is maintained by a mechanical link not involving the high force myosin cross-bridge is also supported by studies showing that agents that block force output by myosin cross-bridges have no effect when added to permeabilized muscles in catch (23Galler S. Höpflinger M.C. Andruchov O. Andruchova O. Grassberger H. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 449: 372-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Butler T.M. Mooers S.U. Siegman M.J. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 3193-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and actually increase catch force when added to activated muscles (24Butler T.M. Mooers S.U. Siegman M.J. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 3193-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Also, there is no measurable turnover of the ADP bound to myosin when catch force is relaxed by phosphorylation of twitchin (25Franke A.S. Mooers S.U. Narayan S.R. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 554-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Insight regarding the portion of twitchin that is involved in possible tethering of thick and thin filaments was provided by the finding that a fragment of twitchin containing the D2 phosphorylation site and flanking Ig domains bound to both actin and myosin when D2 was unphosphorylated but not when phosphorylated (26Funabara D. Hamamoto C. Yamamoto K. Inoue A. Ueda M. Osawa R. Kanoh S. Hartshorne D.J. Suzuki S. Watabe S. J. Exp. Biol. 2007; 210: 4399-4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This and further studies (27Funabara D. Osawa R. Ueda M. Kanoh S. Hartshorne D.J. Watabe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18015-18020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) showed that this fragment of twitchin forms a phosphorylation-sensitive heterotrimeric complex with a portion of the myosin loop 2 region and actin subdomain 1. The implications of such a complex in mediating a connection of thick and thin filaments in catch are obvious. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are thick and thin filament binding regions in the twitchin molecule in addition to those identified in the C-terminal D2 region. The focus was on the N-terminal region containing the D1 and DX regulatory phosphorylation sites that also includes the DFRXXL actin binding motif. The specific portions of the twitchin molecule from Mytilus anterior byssus retractor muscle (ABRM) that were studied are shown in Fig. 1. Peptides ranging from 47 to 52 amino acids included the following: PEVK1, DX, D1, and D2. PEVK1 is from a PEVK-rich region of twitchin that is shorter and has a lower frequency of PEVK residues than titin from vertebrate muscle (12Funabara D. Watabe S. Mooers S.U. Narayan S. Dudas C. Hartshorne D.J. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29308-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This peptide was chosen because the PEVK domain from titin has been shown to interact with actin (28Yamasaki R. Berri M. Wu Y. Trombitás K. McNabb M. Kellermayer M.S. Witt C. Labeit D. Labeit S.

Biol. 2002; 137: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In addition to the DX phosphorylation site, the DX peptide contains the DFRXXL motif. The D1 and the D2 peptides include the D1 and D2 phosphorylation sites, respectively, and surrounding sequences. Recombinant proteins that were studied included IGDXD1IG, DXD1, and IGD2IG. DXD1 includes all of the residues in the linker region between Ig domains containing the DFRXXL motif and the DX and D1 phosphorylation sites, whereas IGDXD1IG includes this region plus the adjoining Ig domains that are the 7th and 8th from the N terminus of twitchin. IGD2IG contains the D2 phosphorylation site near the C terminus of twitchin as well as the flanking Ig domains. Peptides with an N-terminal fluorescein isothiocyanate label were synthesized, and gene synthesis, recombinant protein (with an N-terminal His6 tag) expression in Escherichia coli, and His tag protein purification using a nickel-iminodiacetic acid column were performed by GenScript Corp. (Piscataway, NJ). A peptide with the sequence Ac-AQNKEAETTGTHKKRKSSA-amide was obtained from New England Peptide, LLC (Gardner, MA). This peptide is based on the myosin loop 2 sequence and was shown by Funabara et al. (27Funabara D. Osawa R. Ueda M. Kanoh S. Hartshorne D.J. Watabe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18015-18020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) to inhibit the formation of a trimeric complex between actin, myosin, and the D2 portion of twitchin. All recombinant proteins were subjected to chromatography through a Sephadex G-25 column using an AKTA Prime Plus chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) to effect an exchange into the solution of choice. Fig. 2, A–C, shows SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing the recombinant proteins. Thick and thin filaments were isolated from Mytilus edulis ABRM by differential centrifugation using a modification of the method of Yamada et al. (13Yamada A. Ishii N. Shimmen T. Takahashi K. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 124-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, muscles were treated with Triton X-100 (25Franke A.S. Mooers S.U. Narayan S.R. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 554-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), minced, and then homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in a filament extraction solution containing 10 mm MgATP, 10 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 1 mm free Mg2+, 10 mm PIPES, and 50 μm leupeptin, pH 7.0. The mixture was centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed. This was repeated, and the supernatant was then spun at 5000 × g for 30 min. The thick filaments in the pellet were resuspended in the desired solution. The thin filament-containing supernatant was centrifuged at 134,000 × g for 5 min in an Airfuge (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA) to pellet any remaining thick filaments, and the supernatant was subsequently spun for 30 min at the same speed. The thin filament-containing pellet was subsequently resuspended. Fig. 2, D–E, shows SDS-polyacrylamide gels of the thin and thick filament preparations. The thin filaments consist predominantly of actin and a slightly lower molecular weight protein that shows about 20% of the staining of actin. Most of the tropomyosin was probably lost during purification (31Lehman W. Szent-Györgyi A.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1975; 66: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and as such, the thin filaments are similar to F-actin. The thick filaments consist mainly of myosin and paramyosin with only a very small actin component. All binding experiments were performed at 20 °C. Determination of IGDXD1IG and DXD1 binding to thin filaments was done using a modification of the co-sedimentation technique described by Shaffer et al. (32Shaffer J.F. Kensler R.W. Harris S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) for measuring binding of various fragments of myosin-binding protein C to F-actin. The assay solution was based on a relaxing solution used for permeabilized muscles (24Butler T.M. Mooers S.U. Siegman M.J. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 3193-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Franke A.S. Mooers S.U. Narayan S.R. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. Biophys.

It contained 30 mm PIPES, 20 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgATP, 3 mm free Mg2+, 1 mm DTT, and 21 mm 1,6-diaminohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (HDTA), pH 6.8. Ionic strength was 202 mm. Imidazole (100 mm) was included to help maintain recombinant protein solubility. Separate studies showed that 100 mm imidazole had no effect on active force, catch force, or relaxation of catch force with the addition of cAMP in permeabilized ABRM (data not shown). The thin filaments and different concentrations of the recombinant proteins were combined and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min. This was followed by centrifugation in an Airfuge at 134,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was carefully washed with a small volume of relaxing solution. The pellet was taken up in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels also contained known standards of the recombinant proteins. The protein stain (Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250) was quantified using a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics), and the molar ratio of recombinant protein to actin was determined for each sample. Kd and Bmax were estimated using the one-site saturation ligand binding regression program in the Systat software. In order to test the effect of phosphorylation of the recombinant proteins on the binding to the thin filament, proteins were phosphorylated by the addition of the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (Calbiochem) (150 kilounits/ml) for 1 h at 20 °C. Phosphorylation was confirmed using Pro Q Diamond phosphoprotein stain (Invitrogen), and the D1 phosphorylation-dependent antibody (12Funabara D. Watabe S. Mooers S.U. Narayan S. Dudas C. Hartshorne D.J. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29308-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) confirmed nearly 100% phosphorylation of the D1 site. IGDXD1IG and DXD1 were mixed with a relaxing solution containing thick filaments. After 1 h, the solution was centrifuged at 134,000 × g for 5 min. The pellets containing the thick filaments were carefully washed with relaxing solution and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The amount of recombinant protein was quantified with a His tag antibody and compared with a control in which the thick filaments were removed from the solution prior to the addition of the recombinant proteins. Even with imidazole present, it was difficult to maintain the solubility of IGD2IG for the duration of the co-sedimentation experiments described above. In order to confirm the binding of IGD2IG to the thin filament and to compare it with IGDXD1IG, a solid phase binding assay modified from that described by Funabara et al. (26Funabara D. Hamamoto C. Yamamoto K. Inoue A. Ueda M. Osawa R. Kanoh S. Hartshorne D.J. Suzuki S. Watabe S. J. Exp. Biol. 2007; 210: 4399-4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Funabara D. Osawa R. Ueda M. Kanoh S. Hartshorne D.J. Watabe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18015-18020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was used. In this case, wells in a plastic immunoplate were coated for 45 min with the recombinant proteins in a solution similar to that used for filament isolation except for the inclusion of 100 mm imidazole. The wells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (diluent/blocking solution, KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for 15 min and then washed in rigor solution used for permeabilized muscle experiments. It contained the following: 2 mm EGTA, 3 mm free Mg2+, 1 mm DTT, 30 mm PIPES, 43.2 mm HDTA, pH 6.8. Thin filaments were pelleted in an Airfuge and resuspended in rigor solution (∼1.6 μm actin). Rhodamine phalloidin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) was then added (0.3 μm). The rhodamine phalloidin-labeled thin filaments (50 μl) were added to the wells for 30 min. This was followed by several washes with rigor solution. Rhodamine fluorescence was measured in a Safire2 fluorometric plate reader (Tecan). Bovine serum albumin was used as a control in these experiments. In experiments that tested the effect of phosphorylation, the IGDXD1IG or IGD2IG in the wells was treated with the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in a solution similar to rigor solution but containing 3 mm MgATP. This was followed by washing in rigor solution before the addition of the rhodamine phalloidin-labeled thin filaments. The phosphorylation of the proteins in the wells was confirmed by performing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting followed by detection using the D1 and D2 phosphorylation-sensitive antibodies. The binding characteristics of the various peptides to thin filaments in relaxing solution were determined using a co-sedimentation assay similar to that described for the recombinant proteins. In this case, the peptide quantitation on the gel was determined by comparing the fluorescence of the peptide in a given sample on the gel (measured in a FluorChem imager, Alpha Innotech) with that from known amounts of the peptide run in the same gel. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue to determine the amount of actin in the sample, and the molar ratio of peptide to actin was calculated. The DX and D2 peptides were also synthesized with the DX site (Ser1011) and D2 site (Ser4316) phosphorylated. Synthesis of the D1 peptide with the D1 site (Ser1075) phosphorylated was not successful, so the peptide was phosphorylated by the addition (125 kilounits/ml to 0.16 μm peptide) of the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (Calbiochem) for 1 h. Mass spectrometry showed that this resulted in phosphorylation of two sites (data not shown). Use of a phosphorylation-dependent antibody to the D1 site as described (12Funabara D. Watabe S. Mooers S.U. Narayan S. Dudas C. Hartshorne D.J. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29308-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) confirmed phosphorylation of this site, and it is likely that the second phosphorylated site is another PKA consensus sequence in the peptide (Ser1067). It is not known if this second site is phosphorylated by PKA during the release of catch in the muscle. Detection of proteins on Western blots was accomplished using one of the following primary antibodies: His6 mouse monoclonal antibody (Clontech) (1:600 dilution), rabbit anti-unphosphorylated D1 site antibody (12Funabara D. Watabe S. Mooers S.U. Narayan S. Dudas C. Hartshorne D.J. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29308-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (1:2000 or 1:2500 dilution), and rabbit anti-phosphorylated D2 site antibody (12Funabara D. Watabe S.

Secondary antibodies included anti-mouse IgG peroxidase-linked whole antibody from sheep (GE Healthcare) (1:5000 dilution) and anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-linked whole antibody from donkey (GE Healthcare) (1:5000 dilution). The Amersham Biosciences ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare) was used along with a FluorChem imager. Muscles were dissected, permeabilized with Triton X-100, and subjected to mechanical measurements as described previously (24Butler T.M. Mooers S.U. Siegman M.J. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 3193-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The relaxing solution contained 3 mm MgATP, 5 mm phosphocreatine, 20 mm EGTA, 3 mm free Mg2+, 1 mm DTT, 30 mm PIPES, 15.6 mm HDTA, 1 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.5 mm leupeptin, pH 6.8. The [Ca2+] of the relaxing solution with no added calcium was considered to be pCa >8. The activating solution was similar to the relaxing solution, with the exception that pCa was adjusted to 6.3 by the addition of CaEGTA, whereas the total EGTA was maintained at 20 mm. In some cases, twitchin was thiophosphorylated as described (24Butler T.M. Mooers S.U. Siegman M.J. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 3193-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thiophosphorylated twitchin is resistant to dephosphorylation, so no catch force resulting from endogenous unphosphorylated twitchin is present during these experiments. Peptides were dissolved in the appropriate permeabilized muscle solution, and the pH of this solution was adjusted to match that of the control solution. The proteins to be tested were subjected to chromatography through a Sephadex G-25 column to effect an exchange into the permeabilized muscle solution. Imidazole (100 mm) was included in all protein-containing solutions. In some cases, the effects of peptides on catch force maintenance were tested. (±)-Blebbistatin (Calbiochem) treatment (25 μm) in pCa 6.3 was used to induce the catch state. We have previously shown that under these conditions, ATP usage by the muscle is very low, although much of the force developed before the addition of blebbistatin remains (24Butler T.M. Mooers S.U. Siegman M.J. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 3193-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All of this force is relaxed by phosphorylation of twitchin, and it is thus designated catch force. Statistical analyses were performed using the t test or analysis of variance programs in Sigmastat software. When necessary, two-way analysis of variance with pairwise comparisons were made using the Holm-Sidak method. The ability of the recombinant proteins IGDXD1IG and IGD2IG to bind to thin filaments was tested in a solid phase binding experiment. Fig. 3A shows the fluorescence from rhodamine phalloidin-labeled thin filaments present after washing as a function of the amounts of the recombinant proteins added to the wells. There is a similar concentration-dependent binding of thin filaments to both IGDXD1IG and IGD2IG. Further experiments showed that the sum of the fluorescence associated with thin filament binding to IGDXD1IG (2.8 pmol) and IGD2IG (3.2 pmol) individually (13,059 ± 2356 and 9577 ± 1014, respectively) is similar to that obtained when both are added together in the well (22,565 ± 1446). This means that each of these thin filament binding domains of twitchin act independently. The effect of phosphorylation of the proteins on thin filament binding was tested by adding the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase to the proteins in the wells. Fig. 3, B and C, shows Western blots of the recombinant proteins treated with antibodies that show phosphorylation-dependent binding. The D1 antibody binds only to the unphosphorylated D1 site, whereas the D2 antibody binds only to the D2 phosphorylated site (12Funabara D. Watabe S. Mooers S.U. Narayan S. Dudas C. Hartshorne D.J. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29308-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The results confirm the phosphorylation of both the D1 and D2 sites under the conditions used. The effects of these phosphorylations on thin filament binding are shown for IGDXD1IG and IGD2IG in Fig. 3, B and C, respectively. In both cases, there is a decrease in binding of the thin filaments as a result of protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation. These results strongly suggest that both ends of the twitchin molecule participate in the regulated tethering of twitchin from the thick to the thin filaments. Funabara et al. (12Funabara D. Watabe S. Mooers S.U. Narayan S. Dudas C. Hartshorne D.J. Siegman M.J. Butler T.M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2007462666,"Background Few data have been published on the associations of ferritin with trunk and leg fat depots. We aimed to investigate these associations in a Chinese population. Methodology Trunk fat mass and leg fat mass were determined in a cross-sectional sample of 1,150 Chinese (479 men and 671 women) aged 50–70 years by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan. Fasting plasma ferritin was measured. Principal Findings Plasma ferritin was positively correlated with waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, total body fat and trunk fat mass, but inversely correlated with leg fat mass in men (r = 0.16, 0.26, 0.19, 0.22 and −0.12, respectively, all P<0.05) and women (r = 0.16, 0.16, 0.08, 0.17 and −0.12, respectively, all P<0.05). Multivariate regression analysis showed that ferritin levels increased with larger trunk fat mass (β = 0.33 ± 0.08 for men and β = 0.21 ± 0.05 for women, both P<0.001) while decreased with larger leg fat mass (β = −0.12 ± 0.09, P = 0.15 for men; and β = −0.14 ± 0.05, P = 0.005 for women). Moreover, plasma ferritin levels decreased with increasing tertile of leg fat mass among each tertile of trunk fat mass. Conclusion This is the first study to report the opposite associations of trunk and leg fat depots with plasma ferritin levels."
https://openalex.org/W2117752270,"Congenital sensorineural deafness is an inherited condition found in many dog breeds, including Australian Stumpy-tail Cattle Dogs (ASCD). This deafness is evident in young pups and may affect one ear (unilateral) or both ears (bilateral). The genetic locus/loci involved is unknown for all dog breeds. The aims of this study were to determine incidence, inheritance mechanism, and possible association of congenital sensorineural deafness with coat colour in ASCD and to identify the genetic locus underpinning this disease.A total of 315 ASCD were tested for sensorineural deafness using the brain stem auditory evoked response (BAER) test. Disease penetrance was estimated directly, using the ratio of unilaterally to bilaterally deaf dogs, and segregation analysis was performed using Mendel. A complete genome screen was undertaken using 325 microsatellites spread throughout the genome, on a pedigree of 50 BAER tested ASCD in which deafness was segregating. Fifty-six dogs (17.8%) were deaf, with 17 bilaterally and 39 unilaterally deaf. Unilaterally deaf dogs showed no significant left/right bias (p = 0.19) and no significant difference was observed in frequencies between the sexes (p = 0.18). Penetrance of deafness was estimated as 0.72. Testing the association of red/blue coat colour and deafness without accounting for pedigree structure showed that red dogs were 1.8 times more likely to be deaf (p = 0.045). The within family association between red/blue coat colour and deafness was strongly significant (p = 0.00036), with red coat colour segregating more frequently with deafness (COR = 0.48). The relationship between deafness and coat speckling approached significance (p = 0.07), with the lack of statistical significance possibly due to only four families co-segregating for both deafness and speckling. The deafness phenotype was mapped to CFA10 (maximum linkage peak on CFA10 -log10 p-value = 3.64), as was both coat colour and speckling. Fine mapping was then performed on 45 of these 50 dogs and a further 48 dogs (n = 93). Sequencing candidate gene Sox10 in 6 hearing ASCD, 2 unilaterally deaf ASCD and 2 bilaterally deaf ASCD did not reveal any disease-associated mutations.Deafness in ASCD is an incompletely penetrant autosomal recessive inherited disease that maps to CFA10."
https://openalex.org/W2056021732,"To explore the gender difference of ALT elevation and its association with high hemoglobin levels.A cross-sectional study of 3547 adolescents (2005 females, mean age of 16.5?.3 years) who were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen received health checkups in 2006. Body mass index (BMI), levels of hemoglobin, ALT and cholesterol were measured. ALT >42 U/L was defined as elevated ALT. Elevated ALT levels were detected in 112 of the 3547 participants (3.3%), more prevalent in males than in females (5.4% vs. 1.4%, p<0.001). Hemoglobin levels had a significant linear correlation with ALT levels in both genders. Abnormal ALT started to occur if hemoglobin >11 g/dl in females or >13.5 g/dl in males, but the cumulative cases of elevated ALT increased more quickly in males. Proportion of elevated ALT increased as either the BMI or hemoglobin level rise, more apparent in male adolescents. Logistic regression modeling showed odds ratio (95% confidence interval) were 24.7 (15.0-40.6) for BMI ≥27 kg/m(2); 5.5 (2.9-10.4) for BMI 24-27 kg/m(2); 2.7 (1.3-5.5) for Q5 (top 20th percentile) hemoglobin level; and 2.6 (1.6-4.1) for male gender. Further separately fitting the logistic models for two genders, the significance of Q5 hemoglobin level only appeared in the males.High hemoglobin level is a significant risk factor of ALT elevation after control hepatitis B, obesity and gender. Males have greater risk of abnormal liver function which may be associated with higher hemoglobin levels."
https://openalex.org/W2073314544,"Terminal differentiation of skin keratinocytes is a vertically directed multi-step process that is tightly controlled by the sequential expression of a variety of genes. In this study, we investigated the role of the POU domain-containing transcription factor Brn2 in keratinocyte differentiation. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Brn2 is expressed primarily in the upper granular layer. Consistent with its epidermal localization, Brn2 expression was highly induced at 14 days after calcium treatment of cultured normal human epidermal keratinocytes. When Brn2 was overexpressed by adenoviral transduction, Brn2 led to increased expression of the differentiation-related genes involucrin, filaggrin, and loricrin in addition to inhibition of their proliferation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Brn2 bound to the promoter regions of these differentiation-related genes. We injected the purified Brn2 adenovirus into rat skin, which led to a thickened epidermis with increased amounts of differentiation related markers. The histopathologic features of adenovirus-Brn2 injected skin tissues looked similar to the features of lichen planus, a human skin disease showing chronic inflammation and well-differentiated epidermal changes. Moreover, Brn2 is shown to be expressed in almost all cell nuclei of the thickened epidermis of lichen planus, and Brn2 also attracts T lymphocytes. Our results demonstrate that Brn2 is probably a transcriptional factor playing an important role in keratinocyte differentiation and probably also in the pathogenesis of lichen planus lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2020610675,"Electronic clocks exhibit undesirable jitter or time variations in periodic signals. The circadian clocks of humans, some animals, and plants consist of oscillating molecular networks with peak-to-peak time of approximately 24 hours. Clockwork orange (CWO) is a transcriptional repressor of Drosophila direct target genes.Theory and data from a model of the Drosophila circadian clock support the idea that CWO controls anti-jitter negative circuits that stabilize peak-to-peak time in light-dark cycles (LD). The orbit is confined to chaotic attractors in both LD and dark cycles and is almost periodic in LD; furthermore, CWO diminishes the Euclidean dimension of the chaotic attractor in LD. Light resets the clock each day by restricting each molecular peak to the proximity of a prescribed time.The theoretical results suggest that chaos plays a central role in the dynamics of the Drosophila circadian clock and that a single molecule, CWO, may sense jitter and repress it by its negative loops."
https://openalex.org/W2064127487,"There remains debate about the screening strategies for albuminuria. This study evaluated whether a screening strategy in an apparently healthy population based on basic clinical and biochemical parameters could be more effective than a strategy where screening for albuminuria is performed unselectively.The Unreferred Renal Insufficiency (URI) Study is a cross-sectional study on the prevalence of metabolic risk factors in Belgian workers, volunteering to be screened during a routine yearly occupational check-up. Subjects (n = 295) with treated hypertension, known diabetes, treated dyslipidaemia, cardiovascular and renal disease were excluded. Among 1,191 apparently healthy subjects, 23% had unknown hypertension, 13% had impaired glucose tolerance, 15.4% had normoalbuminuria, 4.2% had microalbuminuria and 0.4% had macroalbuminuria. Subjects with resting heart rate ≥85 bpm, plasma glucose ≥5.6 mmol/L and blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg were associated with albuminuria of any degree. A strategy where only subjects with at least one of these risk factors (n = 431) were screened for albuminuria, would identify all subjects with macroalbuminuria (5/5), 64% of those with microalbuminuria (32/50), and less than half of those with normoalbuminuria (81/183). An alternative strategy whereby subjects were first screened for presence of albuminuria, and additional cardiovascular risk factors were only measured in subjects positive for albuminuria (n = 238), would identify only 27% (118/431) of the subjects with additional and potentially modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. On the other hand, half of the subjects in this study with albuminuria (120/238, of which 102 had normoalbuminuria), had no additional cardiovascular risk factor at all.Screening an apparently healthy population directly for albuminuria will result in a high percentage of false positives, mostly measured in the normal range. Screening for microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria based on presence of additional, potentially modifiable risk factors appears to be more beneficial. Trial registration 2006 NCT00365911."
https://openalex.org/W2163600279,"The Raf/ERK (Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase) signal transduction pathway controls numerous cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, cellular transformation and senescence. ERK activation is thought to involve complex spatial and temporal regulation, to achieve a high degree of specificity, though precisely how this is achieved remains to be confirmed. We report here that prolonged activation of a conditional form of c-Raf-1 (BXB-ER) leads to profound changes in the level and distribution of a heterochromatic histone mark. In mouse fibroblasts, the heterochromatic trimethylation of lysine 9 in histone H3 (H3K9Me3) is normally confined to pericentromeric regions. However, following ERK activation a genome-wide redistribution of H3K9Me3 correlates with loss of the histone modification from chromocentres and the appearance of numerous punctuate sites throughout the interphase nucleus. These epigenetic changes during interphase correlate with altered chromosome structure during mitosis, where robust H3K9Me3 signals appear within telomeric heterochromatin. This pattern of heterochromatinization is distinct from previously described oncogene induced senescence associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), which are excluded from telomeres. The H3K9Me3 histone mark is known to bind the major heterochromatin protein HP1 and we show that the alterations in the distribution of this histone epistate correlate with redistribution of HP1β throughout the nucleus. Interestingly while ERK activation is fully reversible, the observed chromatin changes induced by epigenetic modifications are not reversible once established. We describe for the first time a link from prolonged ERK activation to stable changes in genome organization through redistribution of heterochromatic domains involving the telomeres. These epigenetic changes provide a possible mechanism through which prolonged activation of Raf/ERK can lead to growth arrest or the induction of differentiation, senescence and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1984337288,"An optimization model is introduced in which proteins try to evade high energy regions of the folding landscape, and prefer low entropy loss routes during folding. We make use of the framework of optimal control whose convenient solution provides practical and useful insight into the sequence of events during folding. We assume that the native state is available. As the protein folds, it makes different set of contacts at different folding steps. The dynamic contact map is constructed from these contacts. The topology of the dynamic contact map changes during the course of folding and this information is utilized in the dynamic optimization model. The solution is obtained using the optimal control theory. We show that the optimal solution can be cast into the form of a Gaussian Network that governs the optimal folding dynamics. Simulation results on three examples (CI2, Sso7d and Villin) show that folding starts by the formation of local clusters. Non-local clusters generally require the formation of several local clusters. Non-local clusters form cooperatively and not sequentially. We also observe that the optimal controller prefers “zipping” or small loop closure steps during folding. The folding routes predicted by the proposed method bear strong resemblance to the results in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W1973465438,"RasC is required for optimum activation of adenylyl cyclase A and for aggregate stream formation during the early differentiation of Dictyostelium discoideum. RasG is unable to substitute for this requirement despite its sequence similarity to RasC. A critical question is which amino acids in RasC are required for its specific function. Each of the amino acids within the switch 1 and 2 domains in the N-terminal portion of RasG was changed to the corresponding amino acid from RasC, and the ability of the mutated RasG protein to reverse the phenotype of rasC− cells was determined. Only the change from aspartate at position 30 of RasG to alanine (the equivalent position 31 in RasC) resulted in a significant increase in adenylyl cyclase A activation and a partial reversal of the aggregation-deficient phenotype of rasC− cells. All other single amino acid changes were without effect. Expression of a chimeric protein, RasG1–77-RasC79–189, also resulted in a partial reversal of the rasC− cell phenotype, indicating the importance of the C-terminal portion of RasC. Furthermore, expression of the chimeric protein, with alanine changed to aspartate (RasG1–77(D30A)-RasC79–189), resulted in a full rescue the rasC− aggregation-deficient phenotype. Finally, the expression of either a mutated RasC, with the aspartate 31 replaced by alanine, or the chimeric protein, RasC1–78-RasG78–189, only generated a partial rescue.

The Ras subfamily proteins are monomeric GTPases that act as molecular switches, cycling between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound state (1.Mitin N. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R563-R574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Activation is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors that catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP, and inactivation is regulated by GTPase-activating proteins that stimulate the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP (1.Mitin N. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R563-R574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Activated Ras proteins stimulate numerous downstream signaling pathways that regulate a wide range of cellular processes, including proliferation, cytoskeletal function, chemotaxis, and differentiation (2.Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The diversity of signaling pathways and the complexity of their regulation is emphasized by the presence of a large number of mammalian Ras subfamily homologues with high levels of sequence identity (3.Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), and elucidation of the roles played by each Ras protein remains a formidable challenge. In particular, there is relatively little information about the amino acid sequences that determine Ras protein functional specificity. An important approach to this problem is the analysis of Ras protein function in organisms amenable to genetic manipulation. The Dictyostelium discoideum genome encodes 14 Ras subfamily members, an unusually large number for such a relatively simple organism (4.Eichinger L. Pachebat J.A. Glöckner G.

RasC and RasG are the best characterized of these proteins. Both are activated in response to cAMP during aggregation (9.Kae H. Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G.

There is, however, some overlap of signaling function between the two proteins in that a disruption of both the rasC and the rasG genes is necessary to generate a total loss of cAMP-mediated signaling (10.Bolourani P.

Thus, all cAMP signal transduction during early development appears to be partitioned between pathways that use either RasC or RasG. A simple quantitative assay for cAMP relay is the activation of the adenylyl cyclase, ACA, 2The abbreviations used are: ACAadenylyl cyclase2′-deoxy-cAMP2′-deoxyadenosine-monophosphate. as measured by the accumulation of cAMP in response to a pulse of 2′-deoxy-cAMP. In rasC− cells, ACA activation is reduced to a very low level, indicating the importance of RasC for relaying the cAMP signal. We used this assay to examine which amino acid residues in RasC are required for specific functions. adenylyl cyclase 2′-deoxyadenosine-monophosphate. Strain JH10 was grown at 22 °C in HL5 medium (14.3 g of peptone, 7.15 g of yeast extract, 15.4 g of glucose, 0.96 g of Na2HPO4·7H2O, and 0.486 g of KH2PO4/liter of water), supplemented with 50 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Sigma) and 100 μg/ml thymidine (Sigma) in Nunc tissue culture dishes (Nunc, Rochester, NY). The rasC− cells were grown in HL5 medium, supplemented with 50 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate but without the thymidine supplement. The rasC−/[rasC]:RasG and all other transformants were grown in HL5 medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Cells were routinely grown to a density of ∼4 × 105 cells/cm2 on tissue culture dishes and then harvested by pipetting. For all transformations, 20 μg of the appropriate expression vector (see supplemental Table S1) was electroporated into Dictyostelium cells as described previously (12.Alibaud L. Cosson P. Benghezal M. BioTechniques. 2003; 35 (82–83): 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To observe aggregation streaming, vegetative cells were harvested, washed twice in Bonner's salts, seeded at ∼4 × 105 cells/cm2 in Nunc tissue culture dishes submerged under Bonner's salts, and incubated at 22 °C. Strains were photographed at 10 h following the onset of starvation using a Leica DMIL inverted microscope and LEICA DFC 350F camera. cAMP production was measured by a previously described method (13.van Haastert P.J.M.

Vegetative cell suspensions were centrifuged (500 × g, 5 min), washed twice in KK2 (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.1), and resuspended in KK2 to a final density of 5 × 106 cells/ml. 30 ml of this cell suspension was shaken at 150 rpm for 1 h and then pulsed every 6 min for 5 h, with 100 μl of cAMP to a final concentration of 50 nm using a polystaltic pump (Buchler, Fort Lee, NJ) and a laboratory controller timer (VWR, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Cells were then centrifuged (500 × g, 5 min), washed two times with KK2, and resuspended at a density of 6.25 × 107 cells/ml. The cell suspension was stimulated with 10 μm 2′-deoxy cAMP, and 100-μl samples were lysed at intervals by the addition of 100 μl of 3.5% perchloric acid and 50 μl of 50% saturated KHCO3. cAMP levels were then measured using a cAMP-binding protein assay kit (Amersham Biosciences TRK432). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in 1× Laemmli SDS-PAGE loading buffer (6× buffer: 350 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 600 mm DTT, 0.012% w/v bromphenol blue, 30% glycerol). Samples were then boiled at 100 °C for 5 min, and protein concentrations were determined using the protein assay from Bio-Rad. Equal amounts of protein were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor1989: 18.47-18.55Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences) membranes, blocked with a 5% nonfat milk solution, and probed with the appropriate antibody. Levels of Ras protein were quantified approximately by densitometry (VersaDoc imaging system, model 5000, Bio-Rad). To confirm that proteins had been equally loaded, the gels were also stained with Coomassie Blue solution (0.025% w/v Coomassie G-250, 10% v/v acetic acid). A full description of the plasmids and primers used during the course of this study is given in supplemental Tables S1 and S2. The prasC:rasC vector was generated by ligating the BamHI-XhoI-excised fragment of rasC cDNA from pGEM-rasC into BglII-XhoI restriction sites of prasC plasmid. The pBM2 (rasC:rasG) vector was generated by ligating the BamHI-SalI-excised fragment of rasG cDNA from pGEM-rasG into BglII-XhoI restriction sites of prasC. Site-directed mutants of rasC or rasG were generated using either pGEM-rasC or pGEM-rasG as templates and the oligonucleotide pairs of MC3-F and MC3-R or MG1–9-F and MG1–9-R, respectively, in accordance with the Stratagene PfuTurbo DNA polymerase-based protocol (see supplemental Table S2). pBMC3 expression plasmid was generated by ligating the BamHI-XhoI-excised fragment of pGEM-MC3 into BglII-XhoI of prasC. pBMG1–9 expression plasmids were generated by ligating the BamHI-SalI-excised fragment of pGEM-MG1–9 into BglII-XhoI of prasC. RasG was also modified by two block switches of sequence with RasC. This was accomplished by ligating DNA coding the first 78 amino acids of RasC to DNA encoding amino acids 78–189 of RasG (designated CSA). In addition, a chimeric construct encoding amino acids 1–77 of RasG and 79–189 of RasC was generated (designated CSB). In more detail, to generate pBCSA and pBCSB chimeric constructs, the following strategy was employed. The primers PBRC3-F, PBRC78-R+G overhang, PBRC79-F, and PBRC3-R were used to generate two amplified products of C1 (nucleotides 1–234) and C2 (nucleotides 235–570) from rasC cDNA as template. The primers PBRG10-F, PBRG77-R+C overhang, PBRG78-F, and PBRG8-R were used to generate two amplified PCR products of G1 (nucleotides 1–231) and G2 (nucleotides 232–570) from rasG cDNA as template. The 50-μl reactions were performed in PCR tubes using the standard PCR protocol except that PfuTurbo DNA polymerase was used instead of Taq DNA polymerase to prevent the A-tailing, which would have prevented the proper subsequent cloning. After completion, the amplified products were gel-purified and subjected to a second round of standard amplification. Reactions were performed in 40-μl mixtures in PCR tubes containing 5 μl of 10× PfuTurbo buffer, 2.5 μl of 2.5 mm dNTPs, 1 μl of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (2.5 units/μl), 200 ng of each gel-purified and amplified DNA (C1 and G2) or (G1 and C2), and double distilled H2O to 40 μl. The procedure was interrupted after 10 cycles to add 5 μl each of the PBRC3-F and PBRG8-R primers or the PBRG10-F and PBRC3-R primers, respectively. The resulting products, CSA (C1+G2) and CSB (G1+C2), were gel-purified and then subjected to standard amplification using Taq DNA polymerase and the PBRC3-F and PBRG8-R primers or the PBRG10-F and PBRC3-R primers, respectively. The PCR-amplified products were gel-purified and cloned by T/A ligation into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate pGEM-CSA and pGEM-CSB. pBCSA and pBCSB were generated by ligating the BglII-SalI fragment of pGEM-CSA and the BamHI-XhoI fragment of pGEM-CSB into BglII-XhoI of the prasC expression plasmid. Dictyostelium rasC− cells exhibit a very dramatic developmental phenotype; upon starvation, they fail to aggregate (7.Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4490-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10.Bolourani P. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This phenotype is predominantly due to the low level of cAMP generated in response to a stimulus of 2′-deoxy-cAMP. The activation of ACA provides a quantitative assay (7.Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4490-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10.Bolourani P. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) to determine which amino acids are specifically required for RasC function during aggregation. rasC− cells express wild type levels of RasG (10.Bolourani P. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and generate wild type levels of activated RasG in response to 2′-deoxy-cAMP (11.Bolourani P. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10232-10240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), indicating that RasG cannot substitute for RasC despite the similarities in their amino acid sequences. To understand the basis of RasC specificity, the experimental rationale was to systematically change the amino acids of RasG to match the corresponding amino acids in RasC. As a first step, we determined whether in rasC− cells, expression from an exogenous unmutated rasG gene would enhance the activation of ACA. Because RasG is expressed maximally during growth and is then subsequently down-regulated during aggregation (15.Khosla M. Robbins S.M. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 918-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16.Robbins S.M. Williams J.G. Jermyn K.A. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 938-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), whereas RasC expression increases during early development (7.Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4490-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the rasG gene was expressed from the rasC promoter to ensure maximum RasG expression during aggregation. G418-resistant rasC−/[rasC]:RasG transformants were isolated and subjected to Western blotting to determine RasG protein levels. Some transformants exhibited no increase in the level of RasG protein, whereas others exhibited a slight increase, once again indicating that RasG protein levels in the cell are highly regulated (17.Thiery R. Robbins S. Khosla M. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 1193-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), even when exogenous rasG is expressed from the rasC promoter. Two rasC−/[rasC]:RasG transformants, one with the same RasG protein level as the rasC− cells and one with a slightly higher protein level (Fig. 1), were selected and subjected to further analysis. Neither of the transformants aggregated when plated in plastic dishes under non-nutrient buffer (data not shown), and neither exhibited an increase in cAMP accumulation in response to 2′-deoxy-cAMP, relative to that observed in rasC− cells (Fig. 2), indicating that the slight increase in RasG protein level was not able to substitute for the absence of RasC.FIGURE 2cAMP accumulation in rasC− strains expressing RasG. Cells of strains JH10 (♦), rasC− (▲), and rasC−/[rasC]:RasG (●) were pulsed with cAMP for 5 h, washed, and stimulated with 2′-deoxy cAMP, and samples taken at the indicated times were assayed for cAMP accumulation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The means and standard deviations for three independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The finding that neither the absence of aggregation of the rasC− cells nor ACA activation could be compensated by the expression of exogenous RasG provided an experimental base line to determine whether any amino acid substitution in the RasG molecule could generate a gain of function in ACA activation and rescue the aggregation-deficient phenotype. Because RasC and RasG have a total of nine amino acid differences in the switch I domain and in the region flanking the switch II domain (Table 1), regions that have been shown to be important for Ras/effector interactions (18.Biou V. Cherfils J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6833-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), RasG was modified by mutating cloned versions of the rasG gene, leading to individual substitution of each of the nine non-conserved amino acids with the corresponding amino acids from RasC. The resulting nine constructs were each transformed into rasC− cells, and five clones from each transformation were analyzed by Western blotting with the RasG antibody. Transformants contained either RasG protein levels that were similar to those found in the rasC− cells or slightly increased RasG protein levels (data not shown). Each of the isolated clones was tested for its ability to aggregate on plastic under non-nutrient buffer. Transformants with one of the nine mutations, aspartate at position 30 of RasG changed to the alanine at the equivalent position 31 of RasC, (rasC−/[rasC]:RasGD30A), formed small aggregates (Fig. 3D) but no aggregation streams typical of wild type (Fig. 3A) or fully rescued rasC− cells (Fig. 3C). Transformants expressing the remaining mutations showed no sign of aggregation (data not shown), results identical to that for the rasC− cell (Fig. 3B). Three transformants containing each type of mutation (one with same level of RasG protein and two with a slight increase in RasG protein) were analyzed for 2′-deoxy-cAMP stimulation of ACA activity. The rasC−/[rasC]:RasGD30A transformants were the only single amino acid change transformants that exhibited increase in cAMP accumulation in response to a stimulus of 2′-deoxy-cAMP (Fig. 4). All the others exhibited levels of cAMP accumulation that were not significantly higher than that of the rasC− cells (data not shown).TABLE 1Amino acid comparison of switch I and switch II regions of RasC and RasGProteinRegionAmino acid sequenceaThe sequences 22–40 (switch I) and 50–74 (switch II) of RasG were aligned with the sequences 23–41 (switch I) and 51–75 (switch II) of RasC.

This chimeric construct was transformed into rasC− cells, and several G418-resistant isolates were analyzed for their ability to aggregate and activate ACA. The rasC−/[rasC]:RasG1–77-RasC79–189 transformants showed no aggregation streams (Fig. 3E) but did accumulate 20% of the wild type level of cAMP in response to the 2′-deoxy-cAMP stimulation (Fig. 4). This slight ACA activation suggests a role for the C-terminal portion of the RasC molecule in its function. In view of the apparent importance of both the amino acid at the equivalent of position 30 and the C-terminal portion of the RasC molecule, we next generated a chimeric construct comprising the N-terminal portion of RasG, containing the single change of aspartate to alanine at position 30, and the C-terminal portion of RasC. Transformation of this construct ([rasC]:RasG1–77(D30A)-RasC79–189) into rasC− resulted in cells that exhibited normal aggregation (Fig. 3F) and wild type levels of ACA activation (Fig. 4). This result confirms that the alanine at position 31 of RasC (the equivalent of amino acid 30 in RasG) is the only amino acid in the N-terminal portion of the molecule that is important for signal transduction through RasC, leading to ACA activation, and confirms the importance of the C-terminal portion of the protein. To confirm and extend these observations, we determined which changes in the RasC molecule would result in a loss of function. To this end, the alanine at position 31 of RasC was changed to aspartate, the corresponding amino acid of RasG. When this mutated rasC gene was expressed in rasC− cells, the resulting transformants (rasC−/[rasC]:RasCA31D) produced only very small aggregates, with no sign of aggregation streams (Fig. 3G), and a level of ACA activation that was considerably lower than that resulting from the expression of the non-mutated rasC gene (Fig. 5). This poor activation of ACA and poor aggregation were not the result of a low expression of the rasCA31D gene (Fig. 6). Thus, the single amino acid change at position 31 of RasC generated a loss of function. In addition, DNA encoding the first 78 amino acids of RasC was ligated to DNA encoding amino acids 78–189 of RasG, and this construct was transformed into rasC− cells. The rasC−/[rasC]:RasC1–78-RasG78–189 cells produced only small aggregates (Fig. 3H) and an activation of ACA that was ∼50% of that produced by the intact RasC molecule (Fig. 5), emphasizing the importance of the C-terminal portion of the molecule for its function.FIGURE 6Western blot analysis of RasC protein levels. Lysates (10 μg of protein) of vegetative cells of rasC−, JH10, rasC−/[rasC]:RasC, and rasC−/[rasC]:RasCA31D cells were subjected to Western blot analysis, using RasC-specific antibodies. Levels were quantified by densitometry and found to be the same for all three samples. A single experiment is shown, but identical results were observed for two additional experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have shown previously that RasG and RasC perform distinct functions during aggregation (10.Bolourani P. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11.Bolourani P. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10232-10240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). There is clearly a bifurcation of the signaling pathways, with signaling through RasC being more important for the regulation of ACA activation and signaling through RasG more important for the regulation of chemotaxis, although there does appear to be some overlap of function. This separation of signaling function is almost certainly due to differences in the interaction of the Ras proteins with their downstream effectors. For example, the Ras binding domains (RBDs) of Dictyostelium PI3K1 and PI3K2 bind more effectively to RasG than to RasC (9.Kae H. Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), consistent for the proposed roles for PI3K and RasG in establishing polarity and regulating chemotaxis (10.Bolourani P. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11.Bolourani P. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10232-10240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, there is as yet no direct binding data to indicate the nature of any downstream effectors that have high affinity for RasC. Genetic analyses suggest that the Ras-interacting protein-3 (Rip-3) is required for aggregation and ACA activation (19.Lee S. Comer F.I. Sasaki A. McLeod I.X. Duong Y. Okumura K. Yates 3rd, J.R. Parent C.A. Firtel R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4572-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 20.Lee S. Parent C.A. Insall R. Firtel R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2829-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), functions that also require RasC (7.Lim C.J. Spiegelman G.B. Weeks G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4490-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, both RasC and Rip-3 are important for the functioning of the TORC2 complex, which is necessary for optimum ACA activation and chemotaxis (19.Lee S. Comer F.I. Sasaki A. McLeod I.X. Duong Y. Okumura K. Yates 3rd, J.R. Parent C.A. Firtel R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4572-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 20.Lee S. Parent C.A. Insall R. Firtel R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2829-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, this presumptive connection between Rip-3 and RasC is confounded by the fact that Rip-3 interacts strongly with RasG but does not interact with RasC in yeast two-hybrid analyses (20.Lee S. Parent C.A. Insall R. Firtel R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2829-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and that Rip-3 binds to RasG but does not bind to RasC in an RBD-Rip-3 pulldown assay. 3H. Kae and G. Weeks, unpublished observations. Thus, the signaling pathway that links RasC and ACA activation is still not entirely clear. As an approach to the question of what determines the bifurcation of the signaling pathways through either RasG or RasC, we set out to establish the amino acid determinants that are responsible for RasC and RasG specificity. The requirement of RasC for the maximal activation of ACA in response to 2′-deoxy-cAMP provided an assay for determining the amino acids necessary for RasC specificity. These assays revealed the importance of a single amino acid in the N-terminal portion of the RasC molecule. The replacement of the aspartate at amino acid 30 of RasG by alanine, the corresponding amino acid at position 31 of RasC, was the only single amino acid change of those studied that generated a gain of function. That the alanine at position 31 of RasC was the only important one in the N-terminal portion of the RasC molecule was confirmed by the finding that a fusion of the intact N-terminal portion of RasC to the C-terminal portion of RasG did not enhance the level of ACA activation above that obtained by the single change of aspartate to alanine in RasG (Fig. 5 compared with Fig. 4). The importance for specificity of the alanine at position 31 of RasC was confirmed by the finding that the expression of RasG1–77(D30A)-RasC79–189 restored full ACA activation, whereas the single change of alanine to aspartate in RasC resulted in a reduced activation. The effect of single amino acid changes on Ras protein function has been the subject of several studies in mammalian cells. Mutational changes in the Ha-Ras protein that differentially altered its binding of the protein to Ras effectors was determined by yeast two-hybrid analysis, and the effects of these mutations on the ability of constitutively activated Ha-Ras to malignantly transform mammalian cells were determined (21.White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Mutations at amino acids 35 and 37 both reduced transformation considerably. In a follow-up study, the effects of mutations on three properties that accompanied Ha-Ras-induced malignant transformation were determined (22.Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). It was found that a mutation at position 35 prevented MAP kinase activation but had no effect on membrane ruffling and DNA synthesis, whereas a mutation at amino acid 40 had an effect on MAP kinase activation and DNA synthesis but no effect on membrane ruffling (22.Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In subsequent studies, the importance of Ral GTPase dissociation stimulator and PI3K as downstream effectors of Ras-induced transformation was delineated with the help of the single amino acid mutations (23.Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 24.White M.A. Vale T. Camonis J.H. Schaefer E. Wigler M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16439-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In particular, mutations at amino acids 35, 37, 38, and 40 all had differential effects on Ras binding to Raf, Ral-GDS, and PI3K. In other studies, the amino acids that are specific for Ha-Ras, relative to mammalian Rap1, were altered to the Rap1 equivalents either singly or in pairwise combinations because constitutively activated Rap1 does not induce malignant transformation (25.Marshall M.S. Davis L.J. Keys R.D. Mosser S.D. Hill W.S. Scolnick E.M. Gibbs J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3997-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Changes at amino acids 26, 27, 31, 32, and 45 all reduced the transformation potency of Ha-Ras, with the change of amino acid 45 having the most pronounced effect and the pairwise change at amino acids 30 and 31 having the least drastic effect. None of the amino acids found to be important for malignant cell transformation by constitutively activated Ha-Ras are important for RasC specificity in Dictyostelium. RasG and RasC are identical at positions 27, 29, 35, 37, and 40, and so these amino acids are clearly unimportant for RasC specificity and, although the amino acids at positions 26, 29, and 38 of RasG are different from those in the corresponding positions in RasC, changing these amino acids to the RasC-specific ones did not enhance the ability of RasG to activate ACA. Amino acid 45, identified by the mammalian Ras studies as being important for specificity, is different in RasC and RasG, but we did not determine the effect of such a change because the replacement of the N-terminal portion of RasG with the N-terminal portion of RasC did not enhance ACA activation beyond that observed with the single amino acid change at position 30. Although the Ras amino acid replacement studies in mammalian cells generated important information, they suffer from the fact that they were based on the ectopic expression of the constitutively activated Ha-Ras protein that, in many cases, was produced at aberrantly high levels and often mislocalized within the cell. This high expression of constitutively activated Ha-Ras could be interfering with the functions of other Ras proteins, and it has been suggested that these studies need to be repeated under more physiological conditions (26.Karnoub A.E. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). The studies on Dictyostelium Ras protein specificity reported here do not suffer from these limitations because they are based on the rescue of a normal function, using physiological levels of ectopically expressed protein. Our studies have also emphasized the importance of the C-terminal sequence of RasC in determining specificity. The limited restoration of ACA activation in rasC−/[rasC]:RasC1–78-RasG78–189 transformed cells indicates that although the amino acid 31 of RasC is a key determinant for its specificity, the C-terminal portion of the RasC molecule is also important. The unique role for each of the Dictyostelium Ras proteins may, therefore, be partially specified by the C-terminal hypervariable regions, playing important roles in localization. It is well established that the C-terminal portion of the mammalian Ras family proteins is important for localization within the cell (27.Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), and the finding that the C-terminal portion of RasC molecule plays a role in functional specificity in Dictyostelium implies that the spatial separation of RasG and RasC may play an important role in the signal bifurcation. Consistent with this interpretation, PI3K activation occurs at the leading edge of a migrating cell and probably specifically involves RasG, whereas ACA activation occurs at the trailing end and specifically involves RasC. The study of the specific roles that RasG and RasC play in live cells is currently hampered by the lack of specific reagents that can uniquely identify activated RasC and activated RasG. Creating such specific reagents would be an important step for our future understanding. Download .zip (.1 MB) Help with zip files"
