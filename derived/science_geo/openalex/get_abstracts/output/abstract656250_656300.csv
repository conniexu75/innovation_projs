The objective of this study was to assess the surge capacity of the Kenyan of the Kenyan health system in terms of general hospital and ICU beds in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We assumed that 2% of the Kenyan population get symptomatic infection by SARS-Cov-2 based on modelled estimates for Kenya and determined the health system surge capacity for COVID-19 under three transmission curve scenarios, 6, 12, and 18 months. We estimated four measures of hospital surge capacity namely: 1) hospital bed surge capacity 2) ICU bed surge capacity 3) Hospital bed tipping point, and 5) ICU bed tipping point. We computed this nationally and for all the 47 county governments. Results The capacity of Kenyan hospitals to absorb increases in caseload due to COVID-19 is constrained by the availability of oxygen, with only 58% of hospital beds in hospitals with oxygen supply. There is substantial variation in hospital bed surge capacity across counties. For example, under the 6 months transmission scenario, the percentage of available general hospital beds that would be taken up by COVID-19 cases varied from 12% Tharaka Nithi county, to 145% in Trans Nzoia county. Kenya faces substantial gaps in ICU beds and ventilator capacity. Only 22 out of the 47 counties have at least 1 ICU unit. Kenya will need an additional 1,511 ICU beds and 1,609 ventilators (6 months transmission curve) to 374 ICU beds and 472 ventilators (18 months transmission curve) to absorb caseloads due to COVID-19. Conclusion Significant gaps exist in Kenya’s capacity for hospitals to accommodate a potential surge in caseload due to COVID-19. Alongside efforts to slow and supress the transmission of the infection, the Kenyan government will need to implement adaptive measures and additional investments to expand the hospital surge capacity for COVID-19. Additional investments will however need to be strategically prioritized to focus on strengthening essential services first, such as oxygen availability before higher cost investments such as ICU beds and ventilators."

Transcriptomic analysis of the epithelial compartment allows classification into different phenotypic subtypes as classical and basal-like. However, little is known about the intra-tumor heterogeneity particularly in the epithelial compartment. Growing evidences suggest that this phenotypic segregation is not so precise and different cancerous cell types may coexist in a single tumor. To test this hypothesis, we performed single-cell transcriptomic analyses using combinational barcoding exclusively on epithelial cells from six different classical PDAC patients obtained by Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) with Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA). To purify the epithelial compartment, PDAC were grown as biopsy-derived pancreatic cancer organoids. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis allowed the identification of four main cell clusters present in different proportions in all tumors. Remarkably, although all these tumors were classified as classical, one cluster present in all corresponded to a basal-like phenotype. These results reveal an unanticipated high heterogeneity of pancreatic cancers and demonstrate that basal-like cells, which have a highly aggressive phenotype, are more widespread than expected."

The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of anemia and the utilization rate of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in Japanese patients with CKD. Methods In total, 31,082 adult outpatients with estimated glomerular filtration rates of 5–60 ml/min/1.73 m2 in seven university hospitals were included this analysis. The proportions of patients with CKD stages G3b, G4, and G5 were 23.5%, 7.6%, and 3.1%, respectively. Results The mean (standard deviation) hemoglobin level of male patients was 13.6 (1.9) g/dl, which was significantly higher than the mean hemoglobin level of female patients (12.4 (1.6) g/dl). The mean (standard deviation) hemoglobin levels were 11.4 (2.1) g/dl in patients with CKD stage G4 and 11.2 (1.8) g/dl in patients with CKD stage G5. The prevalences of anemia were 40.1% in patients with CKD stage G4 and 60.3% in patients with CKD stage G5. Logistic regression analysis showed that diagnoses of CKD stage G3b (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 2.32 [2.09–2.58]), G4 (5.50 [4.80–6.31]), and G5 (9.75 [8.13–11.7]) were associated with increased prevalence of anemia. The utilization rates of ESAs were 7.9% in patients with CKD stage G4 and 22.4% in patients with CKD stage G5. Conclusions We determined the prevalence of anemia and utilization rate of ESAs in Japanese patients with CKD using data from a nationwide cohort study."
https://openalex.org/W3044428714,"This study evaluates whole-genome sequence of Lactobacillus reuteri PNW1 and identifies its safety genes that may qualify it as a putative probiotic. It further extracted the bacteriocin produced by the strain and tested its effectiveness against pathogenic STEC E. coli O177. The genomic DNA was sequenced on illuminal Miseq instrument and the sequenced data was assessed for quality reads before assembled with SPAdes. The draft assembly was annotated with Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) and Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST). Further downstream analyses were carried out using appropriate bioinformatic tools. Production of biogenic amines was biochemically confirmed through HPLC analysis. The assembled genome was 2,430,215 bp long in 420 contigs with 39% G+C content. Among all known genes, putatively responsible for the production of toxic biochemicals, only arginine deiminase (EC3.5.3.6) was spotted. Coding sequences (CDS) putative for D-lactate dehydrogenase (EC1.1.1.28), L-lactate dehydrogenase (EC1.1.1.27) and bacteriocin helveticin J were found within the genome together with plethora of other probiotic important genes. The strain harbours only resistant genes putative for Lincosamide (lnuC) and Tetracycline resistant genes (tetW). There was no hit found for virulence factors and probability of the strain being a human pathogen was zero. Two intact prophage regions were detected within the genome of L. reuteri PNW1 and nine CDS were identified for insertion sequence by OASIS which are belong to seven different families. Five putative CDS were identified for the CRISPR, each associated with Cas genes. Maximum zone of inhibition exhibited by the bacteriocin produced L. reuteri PNW1 is 20.0±1.00 mm (crude) and 23.3±1.15 mm (at 0.25 mg/ml) after being partially purified. With the strain predicted as non-human pathogen, coupled with many other identified desired features, L. reuteri PNW1 stands a chance of making good and safe candidates for probiotic, though further in-vivo investigations are still necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3045154845,"Background The disruptive potential of mobile phones in catalyzing development is increasingly being recognized. However, numerous gaps remain in access to phones and their influence on health care utilization. In this cross-sectional study from India, we assess the gaps in women’s access to phones, their influencing factors, and their influence on health care utilization. Methods Data drawn from the 2015 National Family Health Survey (NFHS) in India included a national sample of 45,231 women with data on phone access. Survey design weighted estimates of household phone ownership and women’s access among different population sub-groups are presented. Multilevel logistic models explored the association of phone access with a wide range of maternal and child health indicators. Blinder-Oaxaca (BO) decomposition is used to decompose the gaps between women with and without phone access in health care utilization into components explained by background characteristics influencing phone access (endowments) and unexplained components (coefficients), potentially attributable to phone access itself. Findings Phone ownership at the household level was 92·8% (95% CI: 92·6–93·0%), with rural ownership at 91·1% (90·8–91·4%) and urban at 97.1% (96·7–97·3%). Women’s access to phones was 47·8% (46·7–48·8%); 41·6% in rural areas (40·5–42·6%) and 62·7% (60·4–64·8%) in urban. Phone access in urban areas was positively associated with skilled birth attendance, postnatal care and use of modern contraceptives and negatively associated with early antenatal care. Phone access was not associated with improvements in utilization indicators in rural settings. Phone access (coefficient components) explained large gaps in the use of modern contraceptives, moderate gaps in postnatal care and early antenatal care, and smaller differences in the use of skilled birth attendance and immunization. For full antenatal car, phone access was associated with reducing gaps in utilization. Interpretation Women of reproductive age have significantly lower phone access use than the households they belong to and marginalized women have the least phone access. Existing phone access for rural women did not improve their health care utilization but was associated with greater utilization for urban women. Without addressing these biases, digital health programs may be at risk of worsening existing health inequities."
https://openalex.org/W3043589706,"Background Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has surpassed Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) as the most prevalent bariatric procedure worldwide. While RYGB and SG demonstrate equivalent short-term weight loss, long-term weight loss tends to be greater after RYGB. Differences in the effect of these procedures on gastrointestinal hormones that regulate energy homeostasis are felt to partially underlie differences in outcomes. The objective of this study was to prospectively quantify blood levels of gut hormones of energy and glucose homeostasis at one year follow up to delineate possible reasons for greater efficacy of RYGB over SG in achieving weight loss. Methods Patients undergoing SG (n = 19) and RYGB (n = 40) were studied before surgery and at 2,12, 26, and 52 weeks postoperatively. Blood samples drawn in the fasted state and after a liquid mixed meal were assayed at baseline, 26, and 52 weeks for peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), ghrelin, insulin, glucose, and leptin. Fasting and postprandial appetitive sensations were assessed by visual analog scale. Results At 1 year there was greater weight loss in RYGB compared with SG patients (30% vs 27%; P = 0.03). Area under the curve (AUC) after the mixed meal for PYY was greater in RYGB patients (P<0.001). RYGB patients had significant increases in GLP-1 AUC compared to baseline (P = 0.002). Ghrelin levels decreased only after SG compared to baseline (P<0.001) but were not significantly different from RYGB. There was a trend toward decreased sweet cravings in RYGB patients (P = 0.056). Conclusions Differences in gastrointestinal hormones that regulate energy and glucose homeostasis are a possible mechanism for greater efficacy of RYGB compared to SG."
https://openalex.org/W3044733389,"Laboratory assays such as MIC tests assume that antibiotic molecules are stable in the chosen growth medium-but rapid degradation has been observed for antibiotics including β-lactams under some conditions in aqueous solution. Degradation rates in bacterial growth medium are less well known. Here, we develop a 'delay time bioassay' that provides a simple way to estimate antibiotic stability in bacterial growth media, using only a plate reader and without the need to measure the antibiotic concentration directly. We use the bioassay to measure degradation half-lives of the β-lactam antibiotics mecillinam, aztreonam and cefotaxime in widely-used bacterial growth media based on MOPS and Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. We find that mecillinam degradation can occur rapidly, with a half-life as short as 2 hours in MOPS medium at 37°C and pH 7.4, and 4-5 hours in LB, but that adjusting the pH and temperature can increase its stability to a half-life around 6 hours without excessively perturbing growth. Aztreonam and cefotaxime were found to have half-lives longer than 6 hours in MOPS medium at 37°C and pH 7.4, but still shorter than the timescale of a typical minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay. Taken together, our results suggest that care is needed in interpreting MIC tests and other laboratory growth assays for β-lactam antibiotics, since there may be significant degradation of the antibiotic during the assay."
https://openalex.org/W3042709295,"Collaborative practice between physicians and pharmacists has a positive effect on healthcare outcomes. Understanding the local data related to this collaboration is vital in establishing efficient collaboration. Therefore, this study was designed to assess the collaborative relationships between physicians and pharmacists working in the primary healthcare centres regarding their attitudes and experiences, preferred methods of communication, perceptions related to the role of pharmacists, areas of potential further collaboration, and perceived barriers. A cross-sectional study was conducted using two parallel pretested self-administered questionnaires on a sample of 518 randomly selected physicians and pharmacists. Descriptive and comparative analyses were used in data analysis. The overall response rate was 86.3%. Although over 98% of respondents agreed that physician-pharmacist collaboration improves patient outcomes, more than half of the physicians (52.1%) and pharmacists (55.7%) had never practised collaboratively. Both groups preferred to communicate face-to-face (76.7%) or via telephone (76.5%). Both professions showed good agreement on pharmacists' roles related to managing side effects, improving adherence, assisting in dosage adjustment, providing advice regarding drug interactions, and providing drug information to physicians. They indicated disagreements on the importance of dispensing of prescriptions and providing advice to physicians regarding modification of drug therapy. Both groups expressed overall positive perceptions of the potential for further collaboration in areas related to the clinical roles of pharmacists, which were significantly higher among those with practice experience of < 10 years and those aged < 40 years (p<0.05). The top four perceived barriers to collaborative practice were lack of time (84.1%), lack of financial compensation (76.3%), lack of face-to-face communication (68.9%), and the possible fragmentation of patient care by the involvement of multiple healthcare professionals (68.9%). The present findings provide valuable input that could be a catalyst to enhance or establish physician-pharmacist collaboration in primary healthcare settings in Kuwait."
https://openalex.org/W3044439164,"In the mid-20th century, Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn, caused by maternal alloimmunization to the Rh(D) blood group antigen expressed by fetal red blood cells (i.e., “Rh disease”), was a major cause of fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. However, with the regulatory approval, in 1968, of IgG anti-Rh(D) immunoprophylaxis to prevent maternal sensitization, the prospect of eradicating Rh disease was at hand. Indeed, the combination of antenatal and post-partum immunoprophylaxis is ~99% effective at preventing maternal sensitization to Rh(D). To investigate global compliance with this therapeutic intervention, we used an epidemiological approach to estimate the current annual number of pregnancies worldwide involving an Rh(D)-negative mother and an Rh(D)-positive fetus. The annual number of doses of anti-Rh(D) IgG required for successful immunoprophylaxis for these cases was then calculated and compared with an estimate of the annual number of doses of anti-Rh(D) produced and provided worldwide. Our results suggest that ~50% of the women around the world who require this type of immunoprophylaxis do not receive it, presumably due to a lack of awareness, availability, and/or affordability, thereby putting hundreds of thousands of fetuses and neonates at risk for Rh disease each year. The global failure to provide this generally acknowledged standard-of-care to prevent Rh disease, even 50 years after its availability, contributes to an enormous, continuing burden of fetal and neonatal disease and provides a critically important challenge to the international health care system."
https://openalex.org/W3044656950,"Pancreas/duodenum homeobox protein 1 (PDX1) is an important transcription factor that regulates islet β-cell proliferation, differentiation, and function. Reduced expression of PDX1 is thought to contribute to β-cell loss and dysfunction in diabetes. Thus, promoting PDX1 expression can be an effective strategy to preserve β-cell mass and function. Previously, we established a PDX1 promoter-dependent luciferase system to screen agents that can promote PDX1 expression. Natural compound tectorigenin (TG) was identified as a promising candidate that could enhance the activity of the promoter for the PDX1 gene. In this study, we first demonstrated that TG could promote the expression of PDX1 in β-cells via activating extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), as indicated by increased phosphorylation of ERK; this effect was observed under either normal or glucotoxic/lipotoxic conditions. We then found that TG could suppress induced apoptosis and improved the viability of β-cells under glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity by activation of ERK and reduction of reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. These effects held true in vivo as well: prophylactic or therapeutic use of TG could obviously inhibit ER stress and decrease islet β-cell apoptosis in the pancreas of mice given a high-fat/high-sucrose diet (HFHSD), thus dramatically maintaining or restoring β-cell mass and islet size, respectively. Accordingly, both prophylactic and therapeutic use of TG improved HFHSD-impaired glucose metabolism in mice, as evidenced by ameliorating hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance. Taken together, TG, as an agent promoting PDX1 expression exhibits strong protective effects on islet β-cells both in vitro and in vivo.

Pancreatic islet β-cells, which account for about 80% of the total islet cells, are endocrine cells that secrete insulin and have a vital role in controlling the energy balance of the body (1Da Silva Xavier G. The cells of the islets of Langerhans.J. Clin. Med. 2018; 7: 5410.3390/jcm7030054Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).

In this study, we further validated the effect of TG in promoting PDX1 expression and explored its protective effects on islet β-cells against glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. The molecular mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects of TG were also elucidated. This study provides a basis for the future development of TG as a novel drug targeting PDX1 to protect and repair pancreatic islet β-cells. TG, an O-methylated isoflavone, is a natural product (Fig. 1A). TG was selected by screening compounds that promote PDX1 expression using PDX1 promoter-dependent luciferase reporter gene vector (PGL3-PDX1-luc) 3X. Yao et al., unpublished data. (17Liu L. Liang C. Mei P. Zhu H. Hou M. Yu C. Song Z. Bao Y. Huang Y. Yi J. Wang S. Wu Y. Zheng L. Sun Y. Wang G. et al.Dracorhodin perchlorate protects pancreatic β-cells against glucotoxicity- or lipotoxicity-induced dysfunction and apoptosis in vitro in vivo.FEBS J. 2019; 286: 3718-373610.1111/febs.15020Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, compared with the control group, TG could significantly increase the luciferase activity of PGL3-PDX1-luc–transfected cells (Fig. 1B), implying that TG may have potential to promote the PDX1 expression. To obtain direct evidence that TG can increase the expression of PDX1 in islet β-cells, we first tested the mRNA levels of PDX1 using RT-qPCR in TG-treated INS-1 cells. After treatment with TG for 3 and 9 h, mRNA transcription of PDX1 was increased in a time-dependent manner in INS-1 cells (Fig. 1C). We then examined the protein level of PDX1 by Western blotting. Consistently, TG effectively up-regulated the expression of PDX1 in INS-1 cells and RIN-m5F cells (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1, A and B). In addition, we further demonstrated that TG could also enhance PDX1 expression in native pancreatic islets isolated from mice (Fig. 1D). These results suggested that TG could promote the expression of PDX1 in pancreatic islet β-cells. ERK signaling has been reported to be involved in the regulation of PDX1 expression in islet β-cells (17Liu L. Liang C. Mei P. Zhu H. Hou M. Yu C. Song Z. Bao Y. Huang Y. Yi J. Wang S. Wu Y. Zheng L. Sun Y. Wang G. et al.Dracorhodin perchlorate protects pancreatic β-cells against glucotoxicity- or lipotoxicity-induced dysfunction and apoptosis in vitro in vivo.FEBS J. 2019; 286: 3718-373610.1111/febs.15020Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 28Zhang S.S.

Thus, in this study, we examined whether TG regulates the PDX1 expression also by activating ERK signaling. We first examined the levels of P-ERK by Western blotting and found that the P-ERK levels were markedly increased upon treatment with TG in INS-1 cells and native pancreatic islets isolated from mice (Fig. 1E). At the same time, the ERK inhibitor U0126 almost completely abolished the activation effect of TG on ERK (Fig. 1E). Consequently, U0126 alone or in combination with TG was used to treat PGL3-PDX1 promoter- transfected HEK293T cells. We observed that U0126 alone could decrease the luciferase activity compared with control, and it could counteract TG-mediated increased luciferase activity as well (Fig. 1F). Consistently, U0126 treatment completely abolished TG-induced PDX1 expression at the protein level in islet β-cell lines or mouse islets (Fig. 1G and Fig. S1C). These results suggested that TG could increase PDX1 expression by activating ERK signaling. PDX1 is involved in the regulation of insulin transcription and pancreatic β-cell function (29Brissova M. Shiota M. Nicholson W.E. Gannon M. Knobel S.M. Piston D.W. Wright C.V. Powers A.C. Reduction in pancreatic transcription factor PDX-1 impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.J. Biol.

To further investigate the effects of TG on β-cell function, we evaluated the influence of TG on the insulin secretion of β-cells through a perifusion secretion assay using isolated mouse islets. We observed that both immediate and 24-h treatment of 40 μg/ml of TG could enhance insulin secretion of islets (Fig. 1, H–L). Especially, TG-treated islets for 24 h showed a pronounced increase in the insulin peak after the 33 mm high glucose was loaded when compared with nontreated islets, which suggests that TG can markedly improve the insulin secretion under high-glucose conditions (Fig. 1, K and L). Therefore, these results indicated that TG could indeed potentiate β-cell function, which might be relevant to the increased expression of PDX1. Evidence has suggested that continuous exposure to high concentrations of free fatty acids and glucose may damage islet β-cells, activate apoptosis, and in turn, generate glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity (31Ruan J.S.

We observed that 200 μm palmitic acid (PA) or 33 mm glucose (Glu) significantly decreased cell viability of INS-1 cells, which indicated that both lipotoxic and glucotoxic models were successfully established (Fig. 2, A and B). Contrary, we found that co-treatment with different concentrations of TG could significantly improve the cell viability of both lipotoxic (Fig. 2A) and glucotoxic INS-1 cells (Fig. 2B) in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, we also demonstrated that TG dose-dependently improved cell viability of RIN-m5F cells under lipotoxicity (Fig. S1D). These data showed that TG indeed had protective effects on islet β-cells. Next, we examined whether TG treatment may improve the cell viability of β-cells under lipotoxicity and glucotoxicity by inhibiting apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 2C, cells treated with 200 μm PA or 33 mm glucose increased early apoptosis in those cells compared with control cells (32.1 or 32.6 versus 12.0%). At the same time, 40 μg/ml of TG co-treatment decreased the proportion of 200 μm PA and 33 mm glucose-induced early apoptotic cells to 10.7 and 18.6%, respectively (Fig. 2C). To further explore the mechanisms of action, the ERK inhibitor U0126 was applied to investigate whether ERK signaling was involved in this process (Fig. 1G). As shown in Fig. 2, D and F, as expected, 40 μg/ml of TG increased the viability of INS-1 cells regardless of high-fat or high-glucose conditions, whereas U0126 completely abolished this protective effect. Western blotting analysis showed that TG could reverse the inhibition of 200 μm PA or 33 mm glucose on ERK signaling and PDX1 expression in INS-1 cells, which, however, was blocked by U0126 (Fig. 2, E and G). Moreover, we also examined the levels of caspase 3 (C3) and its activation form, cleaved caspase-3 (CC3), the critical executor, and marker of apoptosis (38Vaux D.L. Strasser A. The molecular biology of apoptosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93 (8637856): 2239-224410.1073/pnas.93.6.2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 39Zhang C. Li L. Zhao B. Jiao A. Li X.

Protective effect of nicotinamide on high glucose/palmitate-induced glucolipotoxicity to INS-1 β cells is attributed to its inhibitory activity to sirtuins.Arch. Biochem.

Contrary, 40 μg/ml of TG co-treatment dramatically reduced the levels of CC3 in both PA (Fig. 2E) and glucose (Fig. 2G) damaged β-cells, which was in line with flow cytometry results (Fig. 2C). Nevertheless, U0126 abrogated the reduction effects of TG on CC3 levels in both lipotoxic and glucotoxic INS-1 cells (Fig. 2, E and G). Taken together, all of these results provided direct evidence showing that TG could prevent the down-regulation of PDX1 expression and islet β-cells apoptosis induced by lipotoxicity and glucotoxicity by activating ERK signaling. It has been suggested that oxidative stress and ER stress contribute to islet β-cell apoptosis (12Cnop M. Toivonen S. Igoillo-Esteve M. Salpea P. Endoplasmic reticulum stress and eIF2α phosphorylation: the Achilles heel of pancreatic β cells.Mol.

Funct. 2019; 37 (30907023): 161-16810.1002/cbf.3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Herein, we examined whether TG has an antioxidant or anti-ER stress activity in INS-1 cells. DCFH-DA fluorescent probe was used to examine the ROS generation in INS-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the fluorescence intensity of ROS was significantly increased in the INS-1 cells treated with either 200 μm PA or 33 mm glucose, whereas 40 μg/ml of TG decreased the fluorescence intensity of ROS in PA- or glucose-treated INS-1 cells (all p < 0.01). The above data suggested that TG might inhibit induced ROS production and oxidative stress. The proapoptotic transcription factor PERK, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) mediate cell apoptosis induced by excess ER stress through activating caspases-12, which then activates caspases-3 (41Fernandez A.

It has been reported that suppressing CHOP expression could reduce apoptosis (12Cnop M. Toivonen S. Igoillo-Esteve M. Salpea P.

We then analyzed these molecules associated with ER stress-related apoptosis in our experimental system to address the effect of TG on ER stress. As shown in Fig. 3, C and E, the expression levels of PDX1 and CC3 in INS-1 cells exhibited the same change upon 200 μm PA or 33 mm glucose treatment with or without TG as the previous results. Simultaneously, we also observed that treatment with PA (Fig. 3, C and D) or glucose (Fig. 3, E and F) significantly enhanced the protein levels of P-PERK, CHOP, and caspases-12 and mRNA levels of ATF4 in INS-1 cells. Contrary, TG co-treatment reversed the levels of ER stress molecules (Fig. 3, C–F). Moreover, compared with the control group, PA or the glucose group showed a decrease in the expression of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic signal in INS-1 cells, which was also at least partially restored by TG (Fig. 3, C and E). Altogether, these data indicated that co-treatment with TG could markedly reduce the lipotoxicity- and glucotoxicity-induced oxidative stress and ER stress, which may contribute to its protective and anti-apoptotic effects on islet β-cells. Diet-induced obese C57BL/6J mice are commonly used as an animal model of T2DM and obesity with elevated blood glucose and impaired glucose tolerance (43Heydemann A.

To validate the in vitro effects of TG on islet β-cells in vivo, we fed C57BL/6J mice with HFHSD to induce mouse islet β-cells dysfunction and diabetes; the model was established according to a previously reported method (44Cui L.

This study aims to measure the extent of women’s empowerment and to examine its associations with the children's health status in Ethiopia. Data were obtained from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS). The sample is restricted to a sub-sample of 10,641 women from 15 to 49 years old and their children under the age of five years. We used children’s height-for-age and weight-for-height Z-scores and pneumonia and anemia experience as indicators of children’s health outcome. Women’s empowerment is measured by five indices reflecting their participation in decision-making, attitudes towards wife-beating by husband, barriers to health care access, asset ownership, and socio-economic variables. These indicators of empowerment were constructed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. A Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model was employed to examine the relationship between women’s empowerment and latent child health outcomes, after controlling for relevant covariates. Results suggests that enhancing women’s empowerment in the household in terms of their socio-economic status (i.e., increasing women’s access to education, information, media, and promoting saving) was associated with less likelihood of the children’s being stunted or wasted (p<0.05). Higher women’s empowerment in terms of household decision-making power were also associated with better children’s health status measured by the children’s experience of pneumonia and anemia (p<0.05). All aspects of women’s empowerment are not related with children’s health indicators. Women’s empowerment dimensions related with child health have a varying degree of association with the different children’s health indicators. Gender-specific policies focusing on increasing women’s access to education, media, information, and promoting saving and their participation in the household decision making are some of the strategies for improving their children’s health and wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W3044695534,"The ecology of the early herbivorous juvenile stage of the crown-of-thorns sea star (COTS, Acanthaster spp.) is poorly understood, yet the success of this life stage is key to generating population outbreaks that devastate coral reefs. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) has been considered to be the main diet of herbivorous juveniles. In this study, we show that COTS can avail of a range of algal food. Juveniles were reared on CCA, Amphiroa sp., and biofilm, and survived for 10 months on all three diets. The juveniles fed CCA and Amphiroa sp. reached 15–16.5 mm diameter at ~ 6 months and maintained this size for the rest the experiment (an additional ~4 months). Juveniles fed biofilm grew more slowly and to a smaller maximum size (~3 mm diameter). However, when juveniles were switched from biofilm to CCA they resumed growth to a new asymptotic size (~13.5 mm, 13–20 months). In diet choice experiments, juveniles did not show a preference between Amphiroa sp. and CCA, but generally avoided biofilm. Our results show that juvenile COTS grew equally well on CCA and Amphiroa sp. and can subsist on biofilm for months. Some juveniles, mostly from the biofilm diet treatment, decreased in size for a time and this was followed by recovery. Flexibility in diet, growth, and prolonged maintenance of asymptotic size indicates capacity for growth plasticity in herbivorous juvenile COTS. There is potential for juvenile COTS to persist for longer than anticipated and increase in number as they wait for the opportunity to avail of coral prey. These findings complicate our ability to predict recruitment to the corallivorous stage and population outbreaks following larval settlement and the ability to understand the age structure of COTS populations."

This structural diversity arises from the number and position of hydroxyl groups and the conjugation of the molecule to glycine, taurine, or neither (11Hofmann A.F. Roda A.

Thus, the composition of the BA pool may affect the activity of BA receptors. However, the biological consequences of altered BA pool composition are not fully known. One key determinant of BA composition is the hepatic enzyme sterol 12α-hydroxylase (encoded by CYP8B1). By adding a 12α-hydroxylation to an intermediate of the BA synthesis pathway, CYP8B1 determines the hepatic synthesis of cholic acid (CA) instead of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (Fig. 1A) (12Russell D.W.

In settings of insulin resistance, there is an increased proportion of CA, its bacterial metabolite deoxycholic acid (DCA), and their conjugates—collectively termed 12α-hydroxylated BAs (12HBAs) in the BA pool (14Haeusler R.A.

Human insulin resistance is associated with increased plasma levels of 12α-hydroxylated bile acids.Diabetes. 2013; 62 (23884887): 4184-419110.2337/db13-0639Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 15Choucair I.

Rates of 12HBA synthesis and CA conversion to DCA are also higher in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (16Brufau G. Stellaard F. Prado K. Bloks V.W. Jonkers E. Boverhof R. Kuipers F. Murphy E.J.

Moreover, even in healthy subjects, increases in 12HBAs are correlated with the characteristic metabolic abnormalities of insulin resistance (14Haeusler R.A. Astiarraga B. Camastra S. Accili D.

Cyp8b1–/– mice also show improved glucose tolerance, which has been proposed to be due to increased secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (21Kaur A. Patankar J.V. de Haan W. Ruddle P.

Mice subjected to vertical sleeve gastrectomy, a common weight loss surgery, exhibit reduced Cyp8b1 mRNA expression as well as lower ratios of 12HBAs:non-12HBAs in circulation (22McGavigan A.K.

Thus, CYP8B1 inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for metabolic diseases. However, the biological processes that are regulated by 12HBAs are incompletely understood. A major site of BA signaling is the intestine, which encounters high BA concentrations, ∼2–12 mm after a meal (24Clarysse S. Tack J. Lammert F. Duchateau G. Reppas C. Augustijns P. Postprandial evolution in composition and characteristics of human duodenal fluids in different nutritional states.J. Pharm.

The intestine epithelium expresses at least three BA receptors. The transcription factor FXR regulates BA transport and feedback suppression of hepatic BA synthesis and also modulates lipid and glucose metabolism (1de Aguiar Vallim T.Q. Tarling E.J. Edwards P.A.

Another intestinal receptor responsive to certain BAs is the vitamin D receptor (VDR), whose canonical role is to promote calcium and phosphate absorption (29Bouillon R. Carmeliet G.

For FXR, it is CDCA (5Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Bledsoe R.K. Chandra G. Consler T.G. Kliewer S.A. Stimmel J.B. Willson T.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Lehmann J.M.

LCA is formed by 7α-dehydroxylation of CDCA by bacterial enzymes in the gut. Thus, BA composition is predicted to impact signaling through multiple receptors in the intestine. Investigating the effects of BA composition on intestinal BA signaling in vivo is challenging because of the continued presence of endogenous BAs. This is particularly important for experiments in mice, as mice contain a class of BAs—muricholic acids, which are non-12HBAs—that are not found in healthy adult humans (although we note that, conversely, all known BAs in the human BA pool are also present in mice and are transported through the mouse intestinal epithelium to undergo enterohepatic circulation). To fill the gap, we used primary murine intestinal organoids, also called enteroids. These organoids are generated from stem cells of the intestinal crypts and contain all known cell types of the intestinal epithelium (30Sato T. Vries R.G. Snippert H.J. van de Wetering M. Barker N. Stange D.E. van Es J.H. Abo A. Kujala P. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche.Nature. 2009; 459 (19329995): 262-26510.1038/nature07935Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar). We investigated the effects of BA pools of different compositions on ileal organoids, with a particular focus on the effects of lowering 12HBAs (to mimic CYP8B1 inhibition). Furthermore, we addressed the interspecies differences in BAs by using BA pools that we designed to mimic the effects of CYP8B1 inhibition in humans and mice. We unexpectedly found that varying 12HBA proportions modulates expression of Slc30a10, a manganese efflux transporter critical for whole-body Mn excretion. Cellular Mn levels are tightly regulated, as Mn is essential for numerous cellular processes, yet its excess is toxic (31Chen P. Bornhorst J. Aschner M. Manganese metabolism in humans.Front. Biosci. 2018; 23 (29293455): 1655-167910.2741/4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate a previously unknown role of BAs in intestinal control of metal homeostasis. To test the effects of a low-12HBA pool on intestinal gene expression, we designed four distinct BA pools with which to stimulate primary murine ileal organoids. The differences between the pools were due to two key features: (i) the proportion of 12HBAs, either 10% (low) or 90% (high), and (ii) the BA pool of the species we modeled, either human or mouse (Table 1 and Fig. 1B). In the human pools, there was a larger proportion of DCA, and the BAs were glycine-conjugated, whereas in the mouse pools, BAs were taurine-conjugated, to mimic the natural abundance in those species (4Ahmad T.R. Haeusler R.A. Bile acids in glucose metabolism and insulin signalling—mechanisms and research needs.Nat. Rev.

Mouse BA pools contained muricholic acids, whereas these were not included in the human pools. Thus, the four BA pools are labeled human low 12HBA (H10), human high 12HBA (H90), mouse low 12HBA (M10), and mouse high 12HBA (M90). Importantly, the total BA pool concentration was the same across all treatment groups. We prepared the four BA pools in mixed micelles containing oleic acid, 2-palmitoyl glycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and free cholesterol to mimic conditions of the intestinal lumen. We used the four lipid-emulsified BA pools to treat primary murine ileal organoids. The vehicle control contained all micelle components except BAs. We performed bulk RNA-Seq after 24 h of treatment.Table 1Composition of BA pools.

Of these, 516 reached those thresholds for both H10 and M10 pools, 95 reached those thresholds for H10 only, and 750 reached the thresholds for M10 only (Fig. S1A).

We used a threshold of log2FC > 1.0 and padj < 0.05 for differential expression. The majority of genes did not reach this threshold, indicating that they are similarly regulated by both low- and high-12HBA pools or are differentially regulated by low versus high 12HBAs in human pools only or in mouse pools only (Fig. S1B). These genes included canonical FXR targets such as Fgf15, Fabp6 (encoding the ileal bile acid–binding protein, Ibabp), and Slc51b (encoding the basolateral BA efflux transporter Ostβ), and we validated these by qPCR (Fig. 1C). There were 44 genes that were preferentially induced by H10 and M10 compared with H90 and M90, respectively (Fig. 1D). Among these, we noted that several are known transcriptional targets of VDR. These included Cyp24a1, S100g, and Cyp3a11, and we validated these by qPCR (Fig. 1E). This is consistent with the concepts that (i) certain BAs, especially the non-12HBA LCA and its conjugates, can activate VDR in the micromolar range (10Makishima M. Lu T.T. Xie W. Whitfield G.K. Domoto H. Evans R.M. Haussler M.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Vitamin D receptor as an intestinal bile acid sensor.Science. 2002; 296 (12016314): 1313-131610.1126/science.1070477Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar), and (ii) the low-12HBA pools (i.e. H10 and M10) contain more LCA (9 μm, as opposed to 1 μm in the high-12HBA pools). Next, we validated the RNA-Seq findings in multiple experimental systems. Using organoids derived from multiple mice, we confirmed that all BA pools induced expression of FXR targets Fgf15 and Fabp6 (Supp. Fig. S1C). We also confirmed that VDR targets Cyp24a1 and S100g were preferentially induced by low-12HBA pools (Fig. S1D). We found that delivery in micelles was not required and that BAs per se were sufficient to induce Fgf15, Fabp6, and S100g (Fig. S1E). Last, to determine whether differential responses to BA pools also occur in human cells, we performed experiments in Caco-2 cells, which are enterocyte-like cells derived from a human epithelial colorectal tumor. We observed that FXR and VDR targets were robustly induced by H10, but not H90 (Fig. S1, F and G). Among the genes identified to be differentially expressed between BA pools with varying 12HBA abundance, one of the most robust was Slc30a10 (Fig. 1D). This gene encodes a Mn efflux transporter critical for whole-body Mn excretion (34Tuschl K. Clayton P.T. Gospe S.M. Gulab S. Ibrahim S. Singhi P. Aulakh R. Ribeiro R.T. Barsottini O.G. Zaki M.S.

https://openalex.org/W3044745372,"The presence of microplastic (MP) particles in aquatic environments raised concern about possible enrichment of organic and inorganic pollutants due to their specific surface and chemical properties. In particular the role of metals within this context is still poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this work was to develop a fully validated acid digestion protocol for metal analysis in different polymers, which is a prerequisite to study such interactions. The proposed digestion protocol was validated using six different certified reference materials in the microplastic size range consisting of polyethylene, polypropylene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and polyvinyl chloride. As ICP-MS/MS enabled time-efficient, sensitive and robust analysis of 56 metals in one measurement, the method was suitable to provide mass fractions for a multitude of other elements beside the certified ones (As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Sb, Sn and Zn). Three different microwaves, different acid mixtures as well as different temperatures in combination with different hold times were tested for optimization purposes. With the exception of Cr in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, recovery rates obtained using the optimized protocol for all six certified reference materials fell within a range from 95.9% ± 2.7% to 112% ± 7%. Subsequent optimization further enhanced both precision and recoveries ranging from 103% ± 5% to 107 ± 4% (U; k = 2 (n = 3)) for all certified metals (incl. Cr) in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. The results clearly show the analytical challenges that come along with metal analysis in chemically resistant plastics. Addressing specific analysis tools for different sorption scenarios and processes as well as the underlying kinetics was beyond this study's scope. However, the future application of the two recommended thoroughly validated total acid digestion protocols as a first step in the direction of harmonization of metal analysis in/on MP will enhance the significance and comparability of the generated data. It will contribute to a better understanding of the role of MP as vector for trace metals in the environment."

In this study, we found that ZBTB1 is down-regulated in breast cancer and this down-regulation is associated with poor outcome of breast cancer patients. ZBTB1 suppresses breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. The majority of breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER) positive and selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen have been widely used in the treatment of these patients.

Our data revealed that ZBTB1 plays a critical role in tamoxifen resistance in vitro and in vivo. To see if ZBTB1 regulates HER2 expression, we tested the recruitments of ZBTB1 on HER2 regulatory sequences.

POK/ZBTB is an emerging family of transcriptional factors that regulates cancer initiation and progression. In search of novel POK/ZBTB proteins that may play critical roles in breast cancer, we interrogated the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data using UALCAN (32Chandrashekar D.S. Bashel B. Balasubramanya S.A.H. Creighton C.J. Ponce-Rodriguez I. Chakravarthi B. Varambally S. UALCAN: a portal for facilitating tumor subgroup gene expression and survival analyses.Neoplasia. 2017; 19 (28732212): 649-65810.1016/j.neo.2017.05.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar) and found that ZBTB1, a member of POK/ZBTB family was significantly down-regulated at mRNA level in breast tumors compared with normal tissues. Although each major subtype of breast cancer exhibits lower level of ZBTB1, a significant lower level of ZBTB1 was observed in HER2-positive and triple-negative than luminal breast tumors (Fig. 1A). To study the alteration of ZBTB1 protein expression, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) using patient breast tissues and found that ZBTB1 protein exhibited a lower level in breast tumors than normal tissues (Fig. 1, B and C). Breast cancer with low ZBTB1 expressions had shorter overall survival (Fig. 1D). These results indicated that ZBTB1 may be a novel suppressor for breast cancer. Because ZBTB1 is down-regulated in breast cancer, we decided to carry out a series of experiments to examine the effect of ZBTB1 on the growth of breast cancer cells. Cell proliferation assays revealed that overexpression of ZBTB1 reduced the proliferation of MCF-7 and T47D cells (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas ZBTB1 shRNA treatment enhanced the proliferation of these two cell lines (Fig. 2, C and D). To exclude the off-target effect of ZBTB1 shRNA, we reintroduced shRNA-resistant ZBTB1 into knockdown MCF-7 cells and found that this construct of ZBTB1 restored cell proliferation (Fig. S1). Soft agar assay showed that ZBTB1 inhibited anchorage-independent MCF-7 and T47D cell growth (Fig. 2, E and F). To examine the effect of ZBTB1 on tumor growth in vivo, ZBTB1 stably expressing cells were injected into nude mice. As shown in Fig. 2, G and H, the decreases in the sizes and weights of tumors excised from animals of the ZBTB1-overexpressing group were observed as compared with those of the control group. Taken together, these data indicate that ZBTB1 plays an important role in the growth of breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. ∼70% of breast cancers are ER-positive and thus disruption of ER function using tamoxifen is the main therapeutic strategy employed in targeting the disease. However, tamoxifen resistance is a major challenge in breast cancer treatment (12Shou J. Massarweh S. Osborne C.K. Wakeling A.E. Ali S. Weiss H. Schiff R. Mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance: increased estrogen receptor-HER2/neu cross-talk in ER/HER2-positive breast cancer.J. Natl.

To investigate the role of ZBTB1 in tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer, we generated the tamoxifen-resistant cell line MCF-7/TamR. We then measured ZBTB1 expression using Western blotting in cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, ZBTB1 presented at a scarcely detectable level in MCF-7/TamR cells. We next investigated if ZBTB1 could be involved in tamoxifen resistance in MCF-7/TamR cells. We found that re-expression of ZBTB1 was capable of sensitizing MCF-7/TamR cells to tamoxifen (Fig. 3B). To confirm this result, we carried out these experiments in another HER2 overexpression and tamoxifen-resistant cell line, BT474, and we obtained similar result (Fig. S2, A and B). In addition, we found that knockdown of ZBTB1 conferred tamoxifen resistance in MCF-7 cells (Fig. S3, A and B). An increasing number of studies have shown that tamoxifen plays an agonist role in ERα-mediated transcription in tamoxifen-resistant cells (12Shou J. Massarweh S. Osborne C.K. Wakeling A.E. Ali S. Weiss H. Schiff R. Mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance: increased estrogen receptor-HER2/neu cross-talk in ER/HER2-positive breast cancer.J. Natl.

In this study, we found that re-expression of ZBTB1 could inhibit ERα transcriptional activity by tamoxifen treatment in MCF-7/TamR cells (Fig. 3C). However, knockdown of ZBTB1 induced ERα transcriptional activity by tamoxifen treatment in MCF-7 cells (Fig. S3C). To determine the role of ZBTB1 on tamoxifen resistance in vivo, ZBTB1 stably expressing cells were injected into nude mice and then mice were treated with tamoxifen. As expected, tamoxifen treatment alone did not significantly alter tumor growth compared with the vehicle control group in mice injected with MCF-7/TamR cells. However, tamoxifen treatment could further potentiate tumor growth inhibition by ZBTB1 (Fig. 3, D and E). These results suggest that ZBTB1 sensitizes breast cancer cells to tamoxifen in vivo. HER2 has been shown to play a critical role in tamoxifen resistance. Our data above showed that ZBTB1 exhibits a much lower level in HER2 overexpressing than luminal breast cancer as well normal tissues. This result indicates a reverse association between HER2 and ZBTB1 expressions. To investigate whether ZBTB1 could regulate HER2 expression in tamoxifen-resistant cells, we first compared HER2 expression in MCF-7/TamR with MCF-7 cells and found that HER2 was present at significantly higher levels in MCF-7/TamR cells (Fig. 4A). We then investigated the effect of ZBTB1 on HER2 expression and found that re-expression of ZBTB1 inhibited HER2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels in the presence of tamoxifen (Fig. 4, B and C, Fig. S4, A and B). Our and other groups' studies show that ERα and its co-activators, such as amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1) and mediator subunit 1 (MED1) bind HER2 intron to regulate HER2 expression in tamoxifen-resistant cells (22Cui J. Germer K. Wu T. Wang J. Luo J. Wang S.C. Wang Q. Zhang X. Cross-talk between HER2 and MED1 regulates tamoxifen resistance of human breast cancer cells.Cancer Res. 2012; 72 (22964581): 5625-563410.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Hurtado A.

To study the molecular mechanisms under HER2 regulation by ZBTB1, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to detect the ERα, AIB1, and MED1 recruitments on ERα-binding region of HER2 intron in MCF-7/TamR and BT474 cells. As a result, we found that re-expression of ZBTB1 diminished MED1 and AIB1 but not ERα recruitments induced by tamoxifen (Fig. 4D, Fig. S4C). However, re-expression of ZBTB1 restored co-repressors such as N-CoR (nuclear receptor co-repressor 1) and HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1) recruitments by ERα onto HER2 intron (Fig. 4E, Fig. S4D). In addition, we found that knockdown of ZBTB1 induced co-activator recruitments but not co-repressor under tamoxifen treatment in MCF-7 cells (Fig. S3, D and E). The above data suggest that ZBTB1 alter ERα co-regulator recruitments onto HER2 intron. Then, we examined the possibility of interaction between ZBTB1 and ERα. The endogenous ZBTB1 protein from MCF-7 cells was immunoprecipitated with an anti-ZBTB1 antibody. Subsequent immunoblotting with anti-ERα antibody indicated that the endogenous ERα was co-precipitated with ZBTB1 in the presence of tamoxifen (Fig. 4F). ChIP–re-ChIP assay confirmed that ZBTB1 interacted with ERα onto the ERα-binding site of HER2 intron (Fig. S5). Finally, we investigate ZBTB1 recruitments by tamoxifen in MCF-7 and MCF-7/TamR cells. As shown in Fig. 4G, ZBTB1 was present on the ERα-binding site of HER2 intron in MCF-7 but not MCF-7/TamR cells. However, re-expression of ZBTB1 restored its occupy on HER2 intron in MCF-7/TamR cells. To further investigate the role of ZBTB1 in tamoxifen resistance, we used 2 target prediction programs, TargetScan and miRanda, to predict miRNAs that target ZBTB1. Our analysis predicted 6 potential ZBTB1-targeting miRNAs. First, we investigate microRNAs, which are dysregulated in tamoxifen-resistant cells and found only miR-23b-3p exhibited a higher level in MCF-7/TamR than MCF-7 cells (Fig. S6). Then, we performed Western blotting and found miR-23b-3p overexpression decreased ZBTB1 expression in MCF-7 and T47D cells, however, miR-23b-3p inhibition increased ZBTB1 expression in MCF-7/TamR and BT474 cells (Fig. 5, A–D, Fig. S7, A–D). Thus, we decided to study the role of miR-23b-3p in tamoxifen resistance. We generated WT and mutant ZBTB1 3′-UTR expression plasmids that were fused to a luciferase reporter according to the matched sequence between ZBTB1 3′-UTR and miR-23b-3p (Fig. 5E). We found that miR-23b-3p overexpression significantly inhibited luciferase activity of WT but not mutant reporter genes in MCF-7 and T47D cells. However, miR-23b-3p silencing specifically enhanced the luciferase activity of WT but not mutant ZBTB1 3′-UTR in MCF-7/TamR and BT474 cells (Fig. 5, F and G, Fig. S7, E and F). To investigate the role of miR-23b-3p in tamoxifen resistance, we transfected MCF-7/TamR and BT474 cells with anti-miR-23b-3p oligo and performed MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Our results showed that miR-23b-3p inhibition significantly sensitized resistant cells to tamoxifen treatment. In addition, knockdown of ZBTB1 diminished the effect of miR-23b-3p inhibition on tamoxifen response in MCF-7/TamR and BT474 cells (Fig. 6A, Fig. S8A). Our data also indicated that miR-23b-3p inhibition suppressed tamoxifen-induced HER2 expression at mRNA and protein levels via targeting ZBTB1 (Fig. 6, B and C, Fig. S8, B and C). We then performed ChIP assays to detect the effect of miR-23b-3P on ERα and its coregulator recruitments on the ERα-binding region of HER2 intron in MCF-7/TamR and BT474 cells. As a result, we found that miR-23b-3p knockdown diminished MED1 and AIB1 but not ERα recruitments induced by tamoxifen (Fig. 6D, Fig. S8D). However, miR-23b-3p knockdown restored co-repressors such as N-CoR and HDAC1 recruitments by ERα onto HER2 intron (Fig. 6E, Fig. S8E). Recent studies established the association of aerobic glycolysis and tamoxifen resistance. Inhibition of aerobic glycolysis can reverse tamoxifen resistance (33He M. Jin Q. Chen C. Liu Y. Ye X.

To investigate the role of miR-23b-3p/ZBTB1 in aerobic glycolysis, we decided to carry out a series of experiments on tamoxifen-resistant cells. Lactate production and glucose uptake increases were observed in MCF-7/TamR cells compared with MCF-7 cells (Fig. S9). More importantly, miR-23b-3p inhibition or ZBTB1 re-expression significantly reduced lactate production and glycose uptake in MCF-7/TamR and BT474 cells in the presence of tamoxifen (Fig. 7A–D, Fig. S10, A–D). Western blotting indicated that miR-23b-3p inhibition or ZBTB1 re-expression suppressed the expressions of HKII (hexokinase II) and LDHA (lactate dehydrogenase A), which are critical for the glycolytic pathway (Fig. 7E, Fig. S10E). Moreover, knockdown of ZBTB1 diminished the inhibitory effect of anti-miR-23b-3p oligo on lactate production and glucose uptake (Fig. 7, F and G). Our Western blotting assays also indicated that miR-23b-3p regulates HKII and LDHA expressions via targeting ZBTB1 (Fig. 7H). These results suggested the role of miR-23b-3p/ZBTB1 in aerobic glycolysis of tamoxifen-resistant cells. Through this study, we have identified a key role of the ZBTB1 protein in tamoxifen resistance through HE"

(2015) protocol. We used two methods, Endemicity Analysis (EA), and Geographical Interpolation of Endemism (GIE). We identified nine AoE of terrestrial flatworms in the Southern Atlantic forest. Performance of the methodologies is discussed. These AoE of land planarians can be explained through vicariance events combined with their physiological and ecological own limitations. Interestingly, these AoE are congruent with fine-scale approaches such as that with harvestmen. Most land planarians have revealed to present a very small distributional range evidencing their potential as a good model for fine-scale studies of AoE."

For that, active TB patients and their contacts were recruited that donated serum and saliva samples. A multiplex assay was performed to study the concentration of different cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Proteins with significant differences between groups were selected and logistic regression and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy. The best marker combinations that discriminate active TB from NoTBI contacts were [IP-10 + IL-7] in serum and [Fractalkine + IP-10 + IL-1α + VEGF] in saliva. Best discrimination between active TB and LTBI was achieved using [IP-10 + BCA-1] in serum (AUC = 0.83) and IP-10 in saliva (p = 0.0007; AUC = 0.78). The levels of TNFα (p = 0.003; AUC = 0.73) in serum and the combination of [Fractalkine+IL-12p40] (AUC = 0.83) in saliva, were able to differentiate between NoTBI and LTBI contacts. In conclusion, different individual and combined protein markers could help to discriminate between active TB and both uninfected and latently-infected contacts. The most promising ones include [IP-10 + IL-7], [IP-10 + BCA-1] and TNFα in serum and [Fractalkine + IP-10 + IL-1α + VEGF], IP-10 and [Fractalkine+IL-12p40] in saliva."
https://openalex.org/W3045024928,"Training prescription and monitoring of team-sport athletes rely on accurate quantification of player movement. Our aim was to determine the sensitivity, reliability and construct validity of measures derived from a wearable device incorporating Global Positioning System (GPS) and accelerometer technology to quantify the peak periods of rugby competition. Match movement data were collected from 30 elite and 30 sub-elite rugby union players across respective competitive seasons. Accelerometer and GPS measures were analysed using a rolling average to identify peak movement for epochs ranging from 5 to 600 seconds. General linear mixed modelling was used to quantify the effects of playing position and match-half on the peak movement and variabilities within and between players represented reliability of each measure. Mean positional differences and match-half changes were assessed via standardisation and magnitude-based decisions. Sensitivity of measures was quantified via evaluation of (""signal"") and typical error of measurement (""noise""). GPS and accelerometer measures had poor sensitivity for quantifying peak movement across all epochs and both levels of rugby union competition (noise 4× to 5× the signal). All measures displayed correspondingly low reliability across most epochs and both levels of competition (ICC<0.50). Construct validity was evident in mean differences between playing positions and match halves that were consistent with expected activity profiles in rugby union. However, it was clear from the pattern of differences across epoch durations and levels of competition that GPS and accelerometer measures provided different information about player movement. The poor sensitivity and low reliability of GPS and accelerometer measures of peak movement imply that rugby union players need to be monitored across many matches to obtain adequate precision for assessing individuals. Although all measures displayed construct validity, accelerometers provided meaningful information additional to that of GPS. We recommend using accelerometers alongside GPS to monitor and prescribe match respresentative training."

We assessed associations between child feces management practices vs. measures of contamination and child diarrhea among households with children <5 years in rural Bangladesh. We visited 360 households quarterly and recorded caregiver-reported diarrhea prevalence, and defecation and feces disposal practices for children <5 years. We examined caregiver and child hands for visible dirt and enumerated E. coli in child and caregiver hand rinse and stored drinking water samples. Safe child defecation (in latrine/potty) and safe feces disposal (in latrine) was reported by 21% and 23% of households, respectively. Controlling for potential confounders, households reporting unsafe child defecation had higher E. coli prevalence on child hands (prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.12, 1.04-1.20) and in stored water (PR = 1.12,1.03-1.21). Similarly, households reporting unsafe feces disposal had higher E. coli prevalence on child hands (PR = 1.11, 1.02-1.21) and in stored water (PR = 1.10, 1.03-1.18). Effects on E. coli levels were similar. Children in households with unsafe defecation and feces disposal had higher diarrhea prevalence but the associations were not statistically significant. Our findings suggest that unsafe child feces management may present a source of fecal exposure for young children."

To determine whether cell-type restricted loss of Sharpin causes similar lesions, a conditional null mutant was created. Ubiquitously expressing cre-recombinase recapitulated the phenotype seen in spontaneous mutant mice. Limiting expression to keratinocytes (using a Krt14-cre) induced a chronic eosinophilic dermatitis, but no inflammation in other organs or lymphoid organ defects. The dermatitis was associated with a markedly increased concentration of serum IgE and IL18. Crosses with S100a4-cre resulted in milder skin lesions and moderate to severe arthritis. This conditional null mutant will enable more detailed studies on the role of SHARPIN in regulating NFkB and inflammation, while the Krt14-Sharpin-/- provides a new model to study atopic dermatitis."

Phagocytosis is mediated by a number of pattern recognition receptors which can recognize distinct target motifs. For example, different surface receptors are utilized to recognize terminal sugar residues, specific lipoproteins, or antibody-coated targets. The mannose receptor, also known as CD206, is one such receptor that recognizes terminal mannose moieties and is expressed highly on lung macrophages. CD206 has been shown to play an important role in the protection against certain bacterial and fungal infections (15O'Riordan D.M. Standing J.E. Limper A.H.

Expression of CD206 and other pathogen recognition receptors at the cell surface makes them particularly susceptible to interaction with extracellular electrophiles, like oxysterols. Yet, it is not known whether oxysterols can form adducts with proteins in lung macrophages, and the impact of oxysterol adduction on macrophage function has not been elucidated. Similar to our previous studies (9Speen A.M. Kim H.H. Bauer R.N. Meyer M. Gowdy K.M. Fessler M.B. Duncan K.E. Liu W. Porter N.A. Jaspers I.

We describe here that targets identified through this protein adductome screen include pattern recognition receptor, including CD206, and describe the functional effects of adduct formation on macrophage phagocytosis. To determine the impact of oxysterols on macrophage function in the lung, we first carried out experiments to identify which macrophage proteins formed oxysterol-protein adducts using an unbiased proteomic approach. To do this, we treated primary human BAL macrophages, which represent the macrophages that would be exposed to ozone in the lung, with an alkynyl-tagged SecoA (a-SecoA), as described under “Materials and methods,” and lysed the cells after 4 h of treatment. We have shown previously that this exposure paradigm forms oxysterol-protein adducts in lung epithelial cells (9Speen A.M. Kim H.H. Bauer R.N. Meyer M. Gowdy K.M. Fessler M.B. Duncan K.E. Liu W.

To isolate oxysterol-protein adducts, the alkyne tag was reacted to allow the cycloaddition of azido biotin (Fig. 1). Biotinylated proteins were immobilized with streptavidin beads and then released using UV light (365 nm) after serial washes to remove unmodified proteins (Fig. 1). This pool of photoreleased proteins was used for subsequent in-gel trypsin digest and analysis by MS to provide an unbiased proteomic analysis of SecoA-protein adducts in human BAL macrophages. Streptavidin blot analysis of proteins following biotin addition revealed that many proteins in the a-SecoA–treated cells incorporated the biotin tag compared with the vehicle treatment, thus validating the efficiency of the click reaction (Fig. 2A).Figure 2a-SecoA forms adducts on macrophage proteins. A, biotin click mixture from vehicle and a-SecoA–treated cells was analyzed by Western blotting and probed with streptavidin fluorophore indicating a-SecoA–adducted proteins clicked with biotin. Actin is served as a loading control. B, oxysterol adducts can be formed through acid catalyzed immine formation of a-SecoA that then transforms to a-SecoB or through conversion of a-SecoA to a-SecoB and then formation of an a-SecoB adduct. The a-SecoB adduct can be identified by the formation of a diagnostic fragment (DF) with a signature 512 m/z.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Proteome-wide analysis after stringent filtration counted 756 spectra having a loss of a 512 m/z fragment diagnostic of a-SecoA/B adduction with b and y ions identifying the specific lysine site of adduction (Table S1). This diagnostic 512 m/z fragment served as a signature fragment of a SecoB adducted peptide shown in Fig. 2B. The conversion of SecoA to SecoB can occur by aldol condensation of free secosterol or at the adduct SecoA-lysine imine stage via an enamine condensation, meaning a protein exposure with either SecoA or SecoB typically yields a set of SecoB peptide adducts (Fig. 2B). The 756 spectra were assigned to 215 unique peptides of BAL macrophage proteins modified with SecoA/B. These adducted peptides were associated with 141 different proteins (Table S2). Gene ontology analysis of the proteins adducted in BAL macrophages showed that most of the SecoA-adducted proteins were found on the vesicle and cell membrane (Fig. 3A). Similarly, functional analysis of adducted proteins showed that protein binding was a major function of adducted proteins (Fig. 3B). Together these data suggested that surface receptors and recognition of foreign material could be impacted by SecoA adduction. A sequence motif analysis plot was generated from comparison of the 756 modified lysine-containing sequences to the reference human database used for this study (33,487 proteins) giving the image shown in Fig. 3C. The motif shows unequivocally that acidic residues located one or two units away from the reactive lysine are significantly overrepresented in the adducted peptides. Indeed, glutamate and aspartate residues are overrepresented across the sequence, with sites at −6, −5, +5, and +6 being favored in addition to the nearest neighbor locations from −2 to +2, suggesting that acidic residues in these positions promote the formation of a-SecoA adducts. Similar to our previous study in lung epithelial cells (9Speen A.M. Kim H.H. Bauer R.N. Meyer M. Gowdy K.M. Fessler M.B. Duncan K.E. Liu W. Porter N.A. Jaspers I. Ozone-derived oxysterols affect liver X receptor (LXR) signaling: A potential role for lipid-protein adducts.J. Biol.

Interestingly, many proteins were identified in our macrophage analysis that were not found in our previous studies. One protein in particular, CD206 (also known as the mannose receptor C type 1, or MRC1), stood out as a protein of particular interest (Table 1 and Fig. 4A). Matching our gene ontology analysis, CD206 is expressed on the cell surface and is a pattern recognition receptor that binds to moieties on various respiratory pathogens (18Martinez-Pomares L.

It is well known that ozone exposure impairs macrophage phagocytosis in vivo (11Devlin R.B. McDonnell W.F. Mann R. Becker S. House D.E. Schreinemachers D. Koren H.S.

Analysis of the proteomic data identified CD206 modified by a-SecoA on Lys-502 in the peptide sequence SQGEIVEVE502K*GCR (Fig. 4A). We confirmed that a-SecoA forms protein adducts with CD206 by Western blotting using the proteins isolated from the click cycloaddition pulldown. Equal levels of CD206 were found in the lysates from vehicle and a-SecoA–treated macrophages prior to the isolation of adducted proteins (Fig. 4B, input). In contrast, CD206 was present in the purified pool of adducted proteins following a-SecoA treatment of BAL macrophages but absent in pulldown pool of proteins in vehicle-treated cells, thus confirming the presence of a-SecoA adduction to CD206 (Fig. 4B, pulldown). We next looked to confirm that the adduction of CD206 was relevant in the context of lung macrophage exposure to ozone. We have previously shown that alkynyl-tagged cholesterol (a-Chol) can be incorporated into cells and, in response to ozone, can form oxysterols, including a-SecoA (9Speen A.M. Kim H.H. Bauer R.N. Meyer M. Gowdy K.M. Fessler M.B. Duncan K.E. Liu W. Porter N.A. Jaspers I. Ozone-derived oxysterols affect liver X receptor (LXR) signaling: A potential role for lipid-protein adducts.J. Biol.

To confirm that the adduction of CD206 occurs following the formation of endogenous oxysterols during ozone exposure, we loaded BAL macrophages with a-Chol for 48 h to allow for incorporation of tagged cholesterol into the cell membrane. Cholesterol analysis of macrophages showed that a-Chol represented 14.5% of all cholesterol in the macrophage samples (Fig. 4C). Macrophages loaded with a-Chol were exposed to either filtered air or 0.4 ppm ozone for 4 h and the formation of adducted proteins was assessed 1 h after ozone exposure. Click chemistry isolation of adducted proteins revealed that ozone exposure of BAL macrophages formed adducts on CD206 (Fig. 4D). The peptides that were identified by MS identified a SecoA adduction site on lysine 502, which is located in between the second and third of eight tandem c-type lectin-binding domains of CD206. These c-type lectin-binding domains (CTLD) are responsible for receptor binding to sugar moieties (20Gazi U. Martinez-Pomares L. Influence of the mannose receptor in host immune responses.Immunobiology. 2009; 214 (19162368): 554-56110.1016/j.imbio.2008.11.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 21Taylor M.E.

Chem. 1992; 267 (1730714): 1719-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that oxysterol adduction of CD206 would thus lead to impaired binding function and consequently affect phagocytosis, similar to what is seen in ozone-exposed macrophages in vivo (11Devlin R.B. McDonnell W.F. Mann R. Becker S. House D.E. Schreinemachers D. Koren H.S. Exposure of humans to ambient levels of ozone for 6.6 hours causes cellular and biochemical changes in the lung.Am. J.

To test this, we used a cell-free binding assay to measure the effect of oxysterols on CD206 binding. ELISA plates were coated with yeast-derived mannan, a known CD206 ligand, to “capture” CD206. Recombinant, His-tagged, human CD206 was treated with oxysterols before incubation on the coated plates, unbound CD206 was washed away, and bound CD206 was detected with an HRP-linked secondary antibody against the His tag. We found that treatment of recombinant human CD206 with increasing concentrations of SecoA and SecoB resulted in a dose-dependent impairment of binding to yeast-derived mannan (Fig. 4, E and F). Interestingly, SecoA reduced binding of CD206 to a greater degree than treatment with SecoB. To determine whether decreased binding of CD206 following adduction with oxysterols resulted in biologically relevant changes in macrophage phagocytosis, we used a THP-1 cell culture model. Although BAL macrophages represent a more relevant cell model for lung macrophages, they are not conducive to genetic silencing/overexpression techniques. Undifferentiated THP-1 monocytes show low expression of CD206; the expression of CD206 can be induced with PMA and subsequent treatment with IL-4 and IL-13 (22Genin M. Clement F. Fattaccioli A. Raes M. Michiels C. M1 and M2 macrophages derived from THP-1 cells differentially modulate the response of cancer cells to etoposide.BMC Cancer. 2015; 15 (26253167): 57710.1186/s12885-015-1546-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), thus providing a convenient model to examine the role of CD206 in the oxysterol-dependent impairment of phagocytosis. Analysis of mRNA transcripts (Fig. 5A) and protein expression (Fig. 5B) confirmed low abundance of CD206 mRNA and protein in undifferentiated THP-1 cells and a robust increase in the expression of CD206 with IL-4 and IL-13 treatment. We used the IL-4/IL-13–differentiated THP-1 cells to investigate the effect of ozone-derived oxysterols on phagocytosis through CD206. Zymosan bioparticles contain mannose residues that can be recognized by CD206 (17Astarie-Dequeker C. N'Diaye E.-N. Le Cabec V. Rittig M.G. Prandi J. Maridonneau-Parini I. The mannose receptor mediates uptake of pathogenic and nonpathogenic mycobacteria and bypasses bactericidal responses in human macrophages.Infect. Immun. 1999; 67 (9916047): 469-47710.1128/IAI.67.2.469-477.1999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We cultured oxysterol-treated cells with pH-sensitive zymosan bioparticles which increase fluorescence following phagocytosis and the drop to acidic pH in the phagosome (23Clapp P.W. Pawlak E.A. Lackey J.T. Keating J.E. Reeber S.L. Glish G.L. Jaspers I. Flavored e-cigarette liquids and cinnamaldehyde impair respiratory innate immune cell function.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2017; 313 (28495856): L278-L29210.1152/ajplung.00452.2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We found that treatment of differentiated THP-1 cells with SecoA and SecoB led to decreases in uptake of zymosan bioparticles (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, oxysterol treatment of undifferentiated THP-1 cells did not affect uptake of zymosan particles suggesting the importance of CD206 adduction in the suppressed zymosan uptake (Fig. 5D). Macrophages express several different surface receptors that recognize different motifs of pathogens or dead and dying cells and aid in phagocytosis (24Gordon S. Phagocytosis: An immunobiologic process.Immunity. 2016; 44 (26982354): 463-47510.1016/j.immuni.2016.02.026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). We aimed to expand our findings to investigate whether the function of other phagocytic receptors is impaired by oxysterols. To do this, we investigated the effects of oxysterols on CD64 and CD16a. Unlike CD206, which recognizes mannose residues on the surface of proteins, CD64 and CD16a are two members of the Fc receptor family which function in binding and phagocytosing antibody-coated pathogens (25Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.P. Fc receptors.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9 (1910686): 457-49210.1146/annurev.iy.09.040191.002325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Even though these two proteins were not initially identified in our proteomic screen, we conducted Western blot analysis on a-SecoA–treated BAL macrophages to determine whether CD64 and CD16a also form SecoA-protein adducts. Fig. 6A shows that SecoA forms adducts with CD64, whereas CD16a was not found to be adducted by SecoA (Fig. 6B). Cell-free binding assays showed that CD64 binding to its ligand, human IgG, was impaired with SecoA and SecoB treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6C). In contrast, SecoA or SecoB treatment did not affect the ability of CD16a to bind human IgG (Fig. 6D), suggesting that not all surface receptors are equally affected by oxysterol adduction. To determine the functional effect of oxysterol adduction, we investigated the uptake of both zymosan and antibody-coated bacterial bioparticles in primary human BAL macrophages. Similar to the THP-1 model, BAL macrophages that were treated with oxysterols showed decreased uptake of zymosan bioparticles (Fig. 7A). Incubation of BAL macrophages with SecoA or SecoB led to significant decreases in the uptake of antibody-coated bacterial particles (Fig. 7B), suggesting that oxysterols affect uptake antibody–coated particles even though binding of not all Fc receptors is affected. Ground-level ozone is one of the most common inhaled pollutants to which humans are exposed. Exposure to ozone has been linked to increases in inflammatory markers as well as increases in susceptibility to infection (6Kesic M.J. Meyer M. Bauer R. Jaspers I. Exposure to ozone modulates human airway protease/antiprotease balance contributing to increased influenza A infection.PLoS One. 2012; 7 (22496898): e3510810.1371/journal.pone.0035108Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Purvis M.R.

This is of particular concern to susceptible populations such as those with underlying lung diseases, like asthma, as decrease in respiratory host defense functions and increased susceptibility to infection can cause exacerbation of disease symptoms and lead to acute lung function decline (4White M.C.

Sustainable production of banana, however, is at risk because of pests and diseases such as Fusarium wilt, caused by the soil-borne fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc). Foc can be disseminated from infested to disease-free fields in plant material, water and soil. Early detection of Foc using DNA technologies is thus required to accurately identify the fungus and prevent its further dissemination with plants, soil and water. In this study, quantitative (q)PCR assays were developed for the detection of Foc Lineage VI strains found in central and eastern Africa (Foc races 1 and 2), Foc TR4 (vegetative compatibility groups (VCG) 01213/16) that is present in Mozambique, and Foc STR4 (VCG 0120/15) that occurs in South Africa. A collection of 127 fungal isolates were selected for specificity testing, including endophytic Fusarium isolates from banana pseudostems, non-pathogenic F. oxysporum strains and Foc isolates representing the 24 VCGs in Foc. Primer sets that proved to be specific to Foc Lineage VI, Foc TR4 and Foc STR4 were used to produce standard curves for absolute quantification, and the qPCR assays were evaluated based on the quality of standard curves, repeatability and reproducibility, and limits of quantification (LOQ) and detection (LOD). The qPCR assays for Foc Lineage VI, TR4 and STR4 were repeatable and reproducible, with LOQ values of 10-3-10-4 ng/μL and a LOD of 10-4-10-5 ng/μL. The quantitative detection of Foc strains in Africa could reduce the time and improve the accuracy for identifying the Fusarium wilt pathogen from plants, water and soil on the continent."

Patients present a paradoxical state of peripheral hyperthyroidism and brain hypothyroidism, this last one most likely arising from impaired thyroid hormone transport across the brain barriers. The administration of thyroid hormones by delivery pathways that bypass the brain barriers, such as the intranasal delivery route, offers the possibility to improve the neurological defects of MCT8-deficient patients. In this study, the thyroid hormones T4 and T3 were administrated intranasally in different mouse models of MCT8 deficiency. We have found that, under the present formulation, intranasal administration of thyroid hormones does not increase the content of thyroid hormones in the brain and further raises the peripheral thyroid hormone levels. Our data suggests intranasal delivery of thyroid hormones is not a suitable therapeutic strategy for MCT8 deficiency, although alternative formulations could be considered in the future to improve the nose-to-brain transport."

In the last few years, however, several studies have shown that Rh-negative subjects have worse health and performance in certain tests than their Rh-positive peers. Nothing is known about the effect of Rh phenotype on the quality of life of subjects as measured by a standard instrument. Methods We hereby analyzed the data of 1768 male (24% Rh-negative) and 3759 female participants (23% Rh-negative) of an anonymous internet study using the partial Kendall test with the age and the population of the hometown of subjects controlled. Results The results showed that the Rh-negative women, but not men, scored worse in wellbeing measured with the WHO-BREFF. The Rh-negative men scored worse in mental health-related variables and in their reported economic situation and the Rh-negative women scored better in physical health-related variables. Both the Rh-negative men and women reported higher sexual activity than their Rh-positive peers. Conclusions The effects of the Rh phenotype were significant after the correction for multiple tests. However, they were usually weaker and less numerous than those of smoking, consuming alcohol, and high body mass index, which were used as a sort of internal control."

Participants older than 19 years were included in the sample for analysis after excluding those with any missing data. The diagnosis of OAG was based on the International Society of Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology criteria, and participants without glaucomatous optic neuropathy served as controls. The frequency of beverage consumption during the past 12 months was obtained through a questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the relationship between consumption of each type of beverage and prevalence of OAG. A total of 6,681 participants was included in the analysis. The prevalence of OAG was 4.4% (n = 323), including 5.4% (n = 169) among men and 3.5% (n = 154) among women. After adjusting for multiple covariates, coffee consumption was significantly associated with OAG, while no significant association was found between consumption of tea or soft drinks and OAG. Participants who drank coffee had a higher risk of having OAG compared with those who did not drink coffee (odds ratio [OR], 2.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22–4.72; p = 0.011). In sex-stratified analyses, the robust association of coffee consumption with OAG was observed in men (OR, 3.98; 95% CI, 1.71–9.25; p = 0.001) but not in women. Our results suggest that coffee consumption may affect the risk of OAG, particularly in men."

Incomplete understanding of variation can preclude students from designing experiments that adequately manage organismal and experimental variation, and from accurately conducting and interpreting statistical analyses of data. Because of the lack of assessment instruments that measure students’ ideas about variation in the context of biological investigations, we developed the Biological Variation in Experimental Design and Analysis (BioVEDA) assessment. Psychometric analyses indicate that BioVEDA assessment scores are reliable/precise. We provide evidence that the BioVEDA instrument can be used to evaluate students’ understanding of biological variation in the context of experimental design and analysis relative to other students and to their prior scores."
https://openalex.org/W3045070683,"Importance Sinonasal symptoms in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis can negatively influence the quality of life and sinuses can be a niche for pathogens causing infection and inflammation leading to a decrease of lung function. Ivacaftor, a potentiator of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator protein, has shown improvement in pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis patients with different forms of class III gating mutations. However, the effects of ivacaftor on sinonasal pathology have hardly been studied. Objective To determine the impact of ivacaftor therapy on sinonasal pathology in patients with cystic fibrosis with an S1251N mutation. Design Prospective observational mono-center cohort study, between June 2015 and December 2016. Setting A tertiary referral center in Utrecht, The Netherlands. Participants Eight patients with cystic fibrosis with an S1251N mutation, treated with the potentiator ivacaftor were investigated. Exposures Ivacaftor (Kalydeco, VX-770) therapy. Computed tomography imaging of paranasal sinuses. Nasal nitric oxide concentration measurements and nasal endoscopy. Main outcomes and measures Primary outcome is opacification of paranasal sinuses examined with computed tomography scan analysis and scaled by the modified Lund-Mackay score before and one year after treatment. Secondary outcomes are nasal nitric oxide concentration levels, sinonasal symptoms and nasal endoscopic findings before and approximately two months and in some cases one year after treatment. Results Computed tomography scan analysis showed a significant decrease in opacification of the majority of paranasal sinuses comparing the opacification score per paranasal sinus before and after one year of treatment with ivacaftor. Median nasal nitric oxide levels significantly improved from 220.00 (IQR:136.00–341.18) to 462.84 (IQR:233.17–636.25) (p = 0.017) parts per billion. Likewise, the majority of sinonasal symptoms and nasal endoscopic pathology decreased or resolved at two months after the use of ivacaftor. Conclusion and relevance Ivacaftor appears to improve sinonasal outcome parameters and thereby sinonasal health in patients with cystic fibrosis with an S1251N mutation."
https://openalex.org/W3045072566,"Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are peripheral synapses between motoneurons and skeletal muscle fibers that are critical for the control of muscle contraction. Dysfunction of these synapses has been implicated in congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). In vertebrates, agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling plays a critical role in acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering and NMJ formation. The adaptor protein DOK7 is the downstream substrate of MuSK and also a cytoplasmic activator of MuSK. The role of DOK7 in the promotion of AChR clustering and the mechanisms involved have been well studied; however, the negative regulation of DOK7 after MuSK activation remains unknown. Anaphase-promoting complex 2 (APC2), the core subunit of APC/C E3 ligase complex, was originally believed to regulate cell-cycle transitions. Here, we show that APC2 is enriched at post-synapse of NMJs in postmitotic myotubes. In response to agrin stimulation, APC2 negatively regulates AChR clustering by promoting the ubiquitination of DOK7 at lysine 243 for its proteolytic degradation, which relies on MuSK kinase activity and the phosphorylation of tyrosine 106 in DOK7. Thus, this study provides a mechanism whereby agrin signaling is negatively regulated as part of vertebrate NMJ homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3045146242,"The Na+-pumping NADH-ubiquinone (UQ) oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) is present in the respiratory chain of many pathogenic bacteria and is thought to be a promising antibiotic target. Whereas many details of Na+-NQR structure and function are known, the mechanisms of action of potent inhibitors is not well-understood; elucidating the mechanisms would not only advance drug design strategies but might also provide insights on a terminal electron transfer from riboflavin to UQ. To this end, we performed photoaffinity labeling experiments using photoreactive derivatives of two known inhibitors, aurachin and korormicin, on isolated Vibrio cholerae Na+-NQR. The inhibitors labeled the cytoplasmic surface domain of the NqrB subunit including a protruding N-terminal stretch, which may be critical to regulate the UQ reaction in the adjacent NqrA subunit. The labeling was blocked by short-chain UQs such as ubiquinone-2. The photolabile group (2-aryl-5-carboxytetrazole (ACT)) of these inhibitors reacts with nucleophilic amino acids, so we tested mutations of nucleophilic residues in the labeled region of NqrB, such as Asp49 and Asp52 (to Ala), and observed moderate decreases in labeling yields, suggesting that these residues are involved in the interaction with ACT. We conclude that the inhibitors interfere with the UQ reaction in two ways: the first is blocking structural rearrangements at the cytoplasmic interface between NqrA and NqrB, and the second is the direct obstruction of UQ binding at this interfacial area.

The mechanism responsible for Na+-pumping driven by electron transfer remains largely elusive. There is an X-ray crystallographic model of V. cholerae Na+-NQR, in an oxidized state, with no bound UQ or inhibitor, which has provided valuable information about the overall structure of the enzyme (13Steuber J.

For example, whereas the sequence of electron transfers through the cofactors of the enzyme has been experimentally determined, the spatial distances between several pairs of redox cofactors in the crystallographic model (e.g. between FMN and riboflavin in NqrB) are too long (29–32 Å) to support physiologically relevant electron transfer (13Steuber J. Vohl G. Casutt M.S. Vorburger T. Diederichs K. Fritz G.

Also, the proposed binding position of the UQ head-ring in the NqrA subunit is located ∼20 Å above the cytoplasmic membrane surface, and too far (∼40 Å in a straight line) from its proximal electron donor, riboflavin, which is predicted to lie between NqrB and NqrE. Therefore, as Steuber et al. (13Steuber J. Vohl G. Casutt M.S. Vorburger T. Diederichs K. Fritz G. Structure of the Vcholerae Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase.Nature. 2014; 516 (25471880): 62-6710.1038/nature14003Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and others have suggested, the subunits harboring the cofactors and the UQ-binding cavity may need to undergo large conformational rearrangements that reduce the spatial gaps at appropriated times during catalytic turnover. In addition, Steuber et al. (13Steuber J. Vohl G. Casutt M.S. Vorburger T. Diederichs K. Fritz G. Structure of the Vcholerae Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase.Nature. 2014; 516 (25471880): 62-6710.1038/nature14003Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) proposed that NqrD and NqrE bind a sixth cofactor, a single iron coordinated by four cysteine residues. This extra cofactor would decrease the distance of one of the longest electron transfers (i.e. from the 2Fe-2S center in NqrF to FMN in NqrC), but does not solve the distance-rate problem entirely. Also the presence of this putative iron center, and its redox function, remain to be verified by further experiments because earlier kinetic and spectroscopic studies, including EPR measurements, have not provided evidence for an additional redox center (6Bogachev A.V.

First, the UQ head-ring labels a part of the rear wall of the UQ binding cavity in the NqrA subunit (NqrA-Leu32−Met39 and Phe131−Lys138, Fig. 2, A and B), which was predicted by the crystallographic model (13Steuber J.

Second, the photoreactive aurachin D-type inhibitors ([125I]PAD-1 and [125I]PAD-2, Fig. 1) label the N-terminal region of NqrB (NqrB-Tyr23−Gly89), which protrudes from the membrane and forms a long stretch that anchors NqrA to the transmembrane subunits (Fig. 2C). Note that only the segment NqrB-Gly38−Gly89 is shown in Fig. 2C because the region Met1−Pro37 was not included in the structural model (13Steuber J. Vohl G. Casutt M.S. Vorburger T. Diederichs K.

Although the region labeled by [125I]PAD-1 and [125I]PAD-2 is in NqrB and the region labeled by the UQ probe is in NqrA, Fig. 2, B and C, shows that the two loci are adjacent, or in close proximity, in the assembled structure. Third, the photoaffinity labeling by [125I]PAD-1 and [125I]PAD-2 rather than being competitively suppressed in the presence of an excess of other inhibitors (including their nonradioactive analogs), is enhanced under some experimental conditions (for example, when a molar ratio of 125I-incorporated inhibitor to Na+-NQR is relatively low). Note that we refer to this seemingly paradoxical result as “unusual competitive behavior” throughout this manuscript.Figure 2X-ray crystallographic model of V. cholerae Na+-NQR and the binding sites of UQ and inhibitors.

This notion seems to be consistent with the earlier steady-state kinetic studies, which suggested that neither HQNO nor korormicin A competes directly with UQ1 (9Nedielkov R. Steffen W. Steuber J.

Although these binding regions protrude from the membrane toward the cytoplasm, we cannot rule out the possibility that the crystallographic structure might differ from that of the native enzyme, as described above. The third finding is difficult to reconcile with a simple scenario in which different inhibitors share a common binding pocket. To explain the unusual competitive behavior of aurachin D-type inhibitors, we earlier proposed an equilibrium model for the binding of the 125I-incorporated inhibitors based on the following three suppositions: (i) there are two distinct inhibitor-bound states (i.e. one-inhibitor– and two-inhibitor–bound states), (ii) the inhibitor binding to the second site is almost negligible unless the first site is already occupied by a molecule of the inhibitor, and (iii) the yield of the labeling reaction in the two-inhibitor–bound state is higher than that in the one-inhibitor-bound state (see Ref. 14Ito T.

Although we cannot exclude other scenarios that could explain the unusual competitive behavior, this model accounts for the consecutive changes in the nature of the competition (from enhancement to suppression) as the concentration of competitor increases. Thus, our previous study provided important insights into the terminal electron transfer step in V. cholerae Na+-NQR (14Ito T. Murai M. Ninokura S. Kitazumi Y. Mezic K.G. Cress B.F. Koffas M.A.G.

Nevertheless, to thoroughly elucidate the mechanisms of action of various potent inhibitors of the enzyme, several issues raised by our previous work still need to be addressed, including the following. First, we were unable to examine the inhibition mechanism of korormicin A (Fig. 1), a very potent natural inhibitor of V. cholerae Na+-NQR (19Yoshikawa K. Nakayama Y. Hayashi M. Unemoto T. Mochida K.

Although aurachin-type inhibitors are also able to inhibit other respiratory enzymes such as complex III (21Von Jagow G. Link T.A.

Although the main upstream effectors that regulate its activity have been extensively studied, the role of the endosomal system has been far less characterized. Here, we identified the late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor MAPK and mTOR activator (LAMTOR) complex as an important regulator of YAP signaling in a preosteoblast cell line. We found that p18/LAMTOR1-mediated peripheral positioning of late endosomes allows delivery of SRC proto-oncogene, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (SRC) to the plasma membrane and promotes activation of an SRC-dependent signaling cascade that controls YAP nuclear shuttling. Moreover, β1 integrin engagement and mechano-sensitive cues, such as external stiffness and related cell contractility, controlled LAMTOR targeting to the cell periphery and thereby late endosome recycling and had a major impact on YAP signaling.

However, the role of this vesicular compartment in the regulation of the signaling pathway that controls YAP activation has not been described yet. Here, we found that β1 integrin–mediated cell adhesion and mechanical inputs regulate LE peripheral dispersion concomitantly with YAP activation. By knocking down p18/LAMTOR1, a major LAMTOR complex subunit, we demonstrated that LAMTOR recruitment to LEs is required for YAP nuclear shuttling and for LE targeting to FAs. Finally, we found that β1 integrins, through integrin-linked protein kinase (ILK), allows the organization of a functional microtubule network that transports SRC-positive LEs to the cell periphery, a crucial process in the regulation of YAP nuclear shuttling. β1 integrins integrate mechano-dependent inputs from the ECM and control vesicular trafficking (3Balasubramanian N.

Therefore, we asked whether LAMTOR-positive LE distribution and dynamics were mechano-sensitive and could act as a molecular link between integrins and YAP activation. First, we verified that YAP activation was mechano-sensitive in the preosteoblast cell line used for this study. YAP expression was mainly nuclear in cells cultured on fibronectin-coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) medium and stiff hydrogels (10 and 30 kPa). Lowering compliance to 2 kPa led to a significant YAP redistribution in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, A and B). Next, we analyzed LAMTOR complex distribution under the same experimental conditions by monitoring the localization of p18/LAMTOR1 fused to GFP (p18-GFP), one of the main subunits of this complex. In cells grown under high-stiffness conditions, p18-positive vesicles were both perinuclear and peripheral, whereas in cells grown in low-stiffness conditions, the amount of peripheral p18-positive vesicles was significantly reduced (Fig. 1, C and D). We observed a similar effect of the matrix rigidity on LE distribution when GFP–Rab-7 was used as an LE marker (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrate that YAP mechano-sensitive response is correlated with LAMTOR-positive LE dispersion toward the plasma membrane. As β1 integrins are key mechano-receptors that control YAP nuclear translocation (11Elbediwy A. Vincent-Mistiaen Z.I. Spencer-Dene B. Stone R.K. Boeing S. Wculek S.K. Cordero J. Tan E.H. Ridgway R.

Conversely, in β1−/− cells, the density of peripheral LEs as well as the number of LEs targeting FA were significantly reduced (Fig. 1, E and F). This defect in LE distribution appears to be specific because when early endosome distribution was analyzed we did not notice any significant difference in their distribution between both genotypes (Fig. 1, G and H). Altogether, these data show that β1 integrins are crucial mechano-receptors controlling LE peripheral dispersion and YAP activation. As the LAMTOR complex is implicated in the regulation of LE positioning in the cell (18Nada S. Hondo A. Kasai A. Koike M. Saito K. Uchiyama Y. Okada M. The novel lipid raft adaptor p18 controls endosome dynamics by anchoring the MEK-ERK pathway to late endosomes.EMBO J. 2009; 28 (19177150): 477-48910.1038/emboj.2008.308Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 26Soma-Nagae T.

To this goal, preosteoblast cells expressing stable shRNAs against p18/LAMTOR1 (sh-p18 cells) were generated and characterized. It was reported that p18/LAMTOR1 is required for docking the LAMTOR complex to LE surface, and consequently its loss leads to the complete inactivation of the complex (18Nada S. Hondo A. Kasai A. Koike M. Saito K. Uchiyama Y. Okada M. The novel lipid raft adaptor p18 controls endosome dynamics by anchoring the MEK-ERK pathway to late endosomes.EMBO J. 2009; 28 (19177150): 477-48910.1038/emboj.2008.308Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Indeed, the LAMTOR complex that was properly detected at LE surface in control cells or in rescue cells (sh-p18 expressing p18-GFP) was no longer observed upon p18/LAMTOR1 silencing (Fig. S1, A and B). Having validated the functional loss of the LAMTOR complex upon p18/LAMTOR1 silencing, next we investigated whether this complex is involved in YAP signaling by analyzing its subcellular localization. With cells cultured on stiff substrate, the silencing of p18/LAMTOR1 significantly reduced YAP nuclear staining compared with control cells (sh-ctl; scramble shRNA) (Fig. 2, A and B). Although not being specifically addressed in this experimental setting, the re-expression of GFP-p18 restored the defective endogenous YAP nuclear localization observed upon p18 silencing (see Fig. 5G), indicating that the effect of p18-directed shRNAs was not due to an off-target silencing. In agreement with its reduced nuclear localization, YAP was reduced but hyperphosphorylated in sh-p18 cells compared with sh-ctl and rescued cells (resc) (Fig. 2C). The reduced level of YAP is likely reflecting its phosphorylation-dependent degradation as reported previously (27Liu C.Y. Zha Z.Y. Zhou X. Zhang H. Huang W. Zhao D. Li T. Chan S.W. Lim C.J. Hong W.

Therefore, the addition of a tag to the p18/LAMTOR1 N terminus should interfere with its recruitment to the LE surface, and this fusion protein should act as a dominant negative form. Therefore, to complement the silencing strategy, we generated a p18/LAMTOR1 chimeric protein in which the GFP protein was fused to its N terminus (GFP-p18). As expected for a dominant negative construction, GFP-p18 displayed a diffuse staining within the cells, and the LAMTOR complex was no longer detected at the LE surface (Fig. S1, A and B). Further supporting the role of p18/LAMTOR1 in YAP signaling, p18/LAMTOR1 silenced cells displayed a significant reduction in YAP nuclear localization (Fig. 2D and Fig. S1B). These results not only confirmed that LAMTOR mediates YAP nuclear localization but also suggest that this process requires LAMTOR docking at the LE surface. YAP signaling was reported to support osteoblast differentiation (8Dupont S. Morsut L. Aragona M. Enzo E. Giulitti S. Cordenonsi M. Zanconato F. Le Digabel J. Forcato M. Bicciato S. Elvassore N. Piccolo S.

Therefore, we investigated whether osteogenic differentiation was affected in sh-p18 preosteoblasts. Control and sh-p18 cells were cultured in osteogenic medium, and alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) was analyzed to visualize the initial stage of osteogenesis. At day 4 of differentiation, ALP staining was significantly reduced in sh-p18 cells compared with sh-ctl cells. At later differentiation stages (day 15), mineralization also was defective in sh-p18 cells, but not in control cells (Fig. 2E). Altogether, these findings show that the LAMTOR complex has an important role in well-characterized YAP signaling regulations. Next, we aimed at understanding how the LAMTOR complex regulates YAP nuclear translocation. Because this later complex controls mTORC1 signaling (17de Araujo M.E.G. Naschberger A. Fürnrohr B.G.

Supporting previous findings, p18/LAMTOR1 silencing induced a decrease in the phosphorylation level of the S6 ribosomal protein, a well-known downstream target of mTORC1 (Fig. 3A). Then we tested whether the defect in YAP nuclear localization observed in sh-p18 cells was caused by down-regulation of the mTOR pathway by inhibiting mTORC1 activity with everolimus. Upon incubation with everolimus, phosphorylated S6 was almost undetectable in β1f/f preosteoblasts cultured on a stiff substrate, confirming the strong inhibitory effect of this molecule (Fig. 3A). However, YAP subcellular localization was comparable in everolimus-treated and control cells (not treated), showing that mTORC1 activation is dispensable for YAP nuclear translocation on a stiff substrate (Fig. 3, B and C). Having excluded the involvement of a LAMTOR-dependent mTOR signaling axis, we hypothesized that this complex might regulate YAP by controlling LE distribution. In particular, it was reported that LEs are targeted to adhesive structures, such as FAs and fibrillar adhesions (21Schiefermeier N. Scheffler J.M. de Araujo M.E. Stasyk T. Yordanov T. Ebner H.L.

To further investigate this putative connection, we co-expressed GFP–Rab-7 and RFP-paxillin (to label LEs and FAs, respectively) in both sh-ctl and sh-p18 cells. First, we confirmed that p18/LAMTOR1 silencing significantly affected LE subcellular positioning (Fig. 3, D and E). We also observed that LE vesicles (green in Fig. 3E) were in close contact with FAs (red in Fig. 3E) in control cells. Conversely, the number of vesicles targeted to FAs was significantly reduced in sh-p18 cells (Fig. 3E; for quantification, see Fig. 3F). Altogether, these data show that p18/LAMTOR1 is an important player in LE targeting to FAs. Importantly, LE positioning and targeting to FAs were not modified by incubation of β1f/f preosteoblasts with everolimus, showing that mTORC1 is not involved in these processes (Fig. 3 (G–I) and Movies S1 and S2). Collectively, these data indicated that LE dynamics and targeting to FAs are controlled by the LAMTOR complex in an mTORC1-independent manner. β1 integrin–mediated adhesion is crucial for YAP nuclear"
https://openalex.org/W3045136496,"Aims Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive primary neuroendocrine tumor of the skin, associated with Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) in 49–89% of cases, depending on the country of origin and the techniques of detection. The presence of MCPyV defines heterogeneity in MCC; MCPyV-negative cases bear a much higher mutational load, with a distinct ultraviolet signature pattern featuring C > T transitions, as a consequence of exposure to ultraviolet light radiation. MCC stroma has not been thoroughly studied, although MCC patients benefit from therapy targeting PD1/PDL1. Methods and results In this study, using Tissue Microarrays and immunohistochemistry, we have analyzed a series of 219 MCC cases in relation to the presence of MCPyV, and confirmed that the presence of MCPyV is associated with changes not only in the neoplastic cells, but also in the composition of the tumor stroma. Thus, MCPyV, found in 101/176 (57,4%) analyzable cases, exhibits changes in its tumor morphology, the density of the inflammatory infiltrate, the phenotype of the neoplastic cells, and the cell composition of the tumor stroma. MCPyV presence is negatively correlated with a higher level of p53 expression, and associated with a very high frequency (86%) of HLA-I expression loss, a higher apoptotic index, and a stroma richer in T-cells, cytotoxic T-cells, macrophages, PDL1-positive macrophages, and B-cells. Conclusions Our findings provide evidence of the basic heterogeneity of MCC, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of MCPyV may induce a rich inflammatory response, which is at least partially avoided through loss of HLA-I antigen expression. On the other hand, MCPyV-negative cases show a much higher frequency of stronger p53 expression and, probably, p53 alterations."

Preoperative axial length (AL) and corneal radius were measured using partial coherence interferometry. The anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens meridian parameter (LMP), lens thickness (LT), thickness of anterior and posterior parts of the crystalline lens (aLT and pLT), and anterior segment length were measured by OCT.

The regression equation using AL, LMP, and pLT (-1.143 + 0.148*AL + 0.428*LMP + 0.254*pLT) showed the strongest correlation with effective lens position (ELP) and smallest standard deviation of ELP prediction error. IOL formula generated using AL, LMP, and pLT yielded the highest predictive accuracy. In a test set, the new IOL formula also produced narrowest range of prediction error, smallest median absolute error, and highest percentages within ±0.25, ±0.50 than existing IOL formulas. The IOL formula considering AL, LMP and pLT will help to improve predictive accuracy in FLACS."

Methods A total of 1226 OSA patients (mean age of 44.9±13.3 years) were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. All subjects were evaluated for gender and age using fourteen polysomnographic, five cephalometric, two comorbid variables, and three self-reported indexes. Frequency analysis was used to screen the distribution of main skeletal patterns and subtypes. Intergroup comparisons were performed using independent t-test, chi-square test or analysis of variance. Univariable regression analysis was done to find a relationship between skeletal risks and OSA characteristics. Results The frequency distribution of skeletal patterns was as follows: sagittally 57.2%, 32.3%, and 10.5% of Class II, Class I, and Cass III; vertically 54.0%, 26.7%, and 19.3% of hyperdivergent, normodivergent, and hypodivergent type, respectively. Polysomnographic, symptomatic, and comorbid variables showed no differences among patients with different skeletal patterns. Conversely, skeletal variables showed no differences according to OSA severity. The prevalence of highly risky skeletal pattern of hyperdivergent Class II was more likely to be females (OR 4.52, P < .01) and less obese (OR 3.21, P < .01), irrelevant to OSA and sleep characteristics. Conclusion Characteristic frequency distributions of skeletal patterns and subtypes were observed in adult OSA patients however, no statistical association was found between the skeletal patterns and OSA characteristics due to the large interindividual variation."

https://openalex.org/W3044763723,"Dietary and physical activity behaviors formed early in life can increase risk for childhood obesity and have continued negative consequences for lifelong health. Previous research has highlighted the importance of both genetic and environmental (e.g., cultural environment or parental lifestyle) contributions to obesity risk, although these studies typically involve genetically-related individuals residing in the same household, where genetic similarity and rearing environment are inextricably linked. Here we utilize a sibling-adoption design to independently estimate genetic and environmental contributions to obesity risk in childhood and describe how these influences might vary as children age. As part of a prospective adoption study, the current investigation used data from biological siblings reared either apart or together, and nonbiological siblings reared together to estimate the contributions of genetics and environment to body mass indices (BMI) in a large cohort of children (N = 711). We used a variance partitioning model to allocate variation in BMI to that which is due to shared genetics, common environment, or unique environment in this cohort during middle childhood and adolescence. We found 63% of the total variance in BMI could be attributed to heritable factors in middle childhood sibling pairs (age 5–11.99; 95% CI [0.41,0.85]). Additionally, we observed that common environment explained 31% of variation in BMI in this group (95% CI [0.11,0.5]), with unique environment and error explaining the remaining variance. We failed to detect an influence of genetics or common environment in older sibling pairs (12–18) or pairs spanning childhood and adolescence (large sibling age difference), but home type (adoptive versus birth) was an important predictor of BMI in adolescence. The presence of strong common environment effects during childhood suggests that early interventions at the family level in middle childhood could be effective in mitigating obesity risk in later childhood and adolescence."

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms regarding Manila grass responses to cold stress, we performed transcriptome sequencing of leaves exposed to 4°C for 0 (CK), 2h (2h_CT) and 72h (72h_CT) by Illumina technology. Approximately 250 million paired-end reads were obtained and de novo assembled into 82,605 unigenes. A total of 34,879 unigenes were annotated by comparing their sequence to public protein databases. At the 2h- and 72h-cold time points, 324 and 5,851 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) and metabolism pathway (KEGG) enrichment analyses of DEGs indicated that auxin, gibberellins, ethylene and calcium took part in the cold signal transduction in the early period. And in the late cold period, electron transport activities, photosynthetic machinery and activity, carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism, redox equilibrium and hormone metabolism were disturbed. Low temperature stress triggered high light, drought and oxidative stress. At the physiological level, cold stress induced a decrease in water content, an increase in levels of total soluble sugar, free proline and MDA, and changes in bioactive gibberellins levels, which supported the changes in gene expression. The results provided a large set of sequence data of Manila grass as well as molecular mechanisms of the grass in response to cold stress. This information will be helpful for future study of molecular breeding and turf management."
https://openalex.org/W3044431160,"Background We investigated associations of area-level deprivation with obstetric and perinatal outcomes in a large population-based routine dataset. Methods We used the data of n = 827,105 deliveries who were born in hospitals between 2009 to 2016 in Bavaria, Germany. The Bavarian Index of Multiple Deprivation (BIMD) on district level was assigned to each mother by the zip code of her residential address. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for preterm deliveries, Caesarian sections (CS), stillbirths, small for gestational age (SGA) births and low 5-minute Apgar scores by BIMD quintiles with and without adjustment for potential confounders. Results We observed a significantly increased risk for preterm deliveries in mothers from the most deprived compared to the least deprived districts (e.g. OR [95% CI] for highest compared to lowest deprivation quintile: 1.06 [1.03, 1.09]) in adjusted analyses. Increased deprivation was also associated with higher SGA and secondary CS rates, but with lower proportions of stillbirths, primary CS and low Apgar scores. When one large clinic with an unusually high stillbirth rate was excluded, the association of BIMD with stillbirths was attenuated and almost disappeared. Conclusions We found that area-level deprivation in Bavaria was positively associated with preterm and SGA births, confirming previous studies. In contrast, the finding of an inverse association between deprivation and both stillbirth rates and low Apgar score came somewhat surprising. However, we conclude that the stillbirths finding is spurious and reflects regional bias due to a clinic which seems to specialize in termination of pregnancies."

MD simulations reveal that the intermolecular interactions preferentially occur between specific PIP2 phosphate groups and hPLD2 residues; the most strongly interacting residues are arginine at the pbox consensus sequence (PX) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Interaction networks indicate formation of clusters at the protein-membrane interface consisting of amino acids, PIP2, and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidic acid (POPA); the largest cluster was in the PH domain."
https://openalex.org/W3043458768,"The endothelin receptor type B (ETBR) regulates water and electrolyte balance and blood pressure, in part, by inhibiting renal sodium transport. Our preliminary study found that the ETBR-mediated diuresis and natriuresis are impaired in hypertension with unknown mechanism. Persistently increased activity of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 4 (GRK4), caused by increased expression or genetic variants (eg, GRKγ142V), impairs the ability of the kidney to excrete a sodium load, in part, by impairing renal dopamine D1 receptor function through persistent phosphorylation. Our present study found that although renal ETBR expression was not different between Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), renal ETBR phosphorylation was higher in SHRs. The role of hyper-phosphorylation in impaired ETBR-function was supported by results in human (h) GRK4γ transgenic mice. Stimulation of ETBR by BQ3020-induced natriuresis in human (h) GRK4γ wild-type (WT) mice. However, in hGRK4γ 142V transgenic mice, the renal ETBR was hyperphosphorylated and ETBR-mediated natriuresis and diuresis were not evident. There were co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation of ETBR and GRK4 in renal proximal tubule (RPT) cells from both WKY and SHRs but was greater in the latter than the former group. SiRNA-mediated downregulation of GRK4 expression, recovered the impaired inhibitory effect of ETBR on Na+ -K+ -ATPase activity in RPT cells from SHR. In vivo downregulation of renal GRK4 expression, via ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction, decreased ETBR phosphorylation and restored ETBR-mediated natriuresis and diuresis in SHRs. This study provides a mechanism by which GRK4, via regulation of renal ETBR function, participates in the pathogenesis of hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W3044334196,"Birthweight continues to be the leading infant health indicator and the main focus of infant health policy. Low birthweight babies are at a higher risk of mortality and morbidity in most low-income countries. However, the physical activity level of pregnant women and its association with low birthweight is not well studied in Ethiopia. To address the above gap, we aimed to examine the maternal physical activity level and other characteristics during the third trimester and its association with birthweight at term in South Ethiopia. A community-based prospective cohort study was conducted among 247 randomly selected women in their third trimester of pregnancy. We measured the physical activity level using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire, which included the type and level of various categories of activities. Anthropometric measurements of mothers were taken following standard procedures, and birthweight was recorded within 72 hours of delivery. To identify the effect of physical activity level and other maternal characteristics on low birthweight, we performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis. Overall, 111 (47.2%) mothers were engaged in vigorous physical activities during third trimester. The incidence of low birthweight was 21.6% and 9.68% among newborns of mothers who engaged in vigorous and moderate or low physical activity, respectively. The incidence of low birthweight at term was significantly associated with vigorous physical activity [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.48; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01–6.09], prolonged standing [AOR = 3.37; 95% CI: 1.14–9.93], and squatting [AOR = 2.61; 95% CI: 1.04–6.54)] during the third trimester of pregnancy. The vast majority of pregnant women were engaged in vigorous physical activities in their third trimester. Engagement in vigorous physical activity, standing for longer hours, and squatting were the major contributors to low birthweight at term. Hence, focused counseling should be conducted to reduce vigorous physical activity, standing, and squatting during the third trimester among pregnant women."

The model inputs used sexual behavior parameters from the MSM population of the START trial, and transmission rates per-sex act and HIV-1 RNA from recent meta-analyses. HIV-1 RNA decay curves were modeled from the databases of Single (efavirenz [EFV] v dolutegravir [DTG]), Spring-2 (raltegravir [RAL] v DTG), and Flamingo (darunavir/ritonavir [DRVr] v DTG) trials.We found that the number of HIV-TE per index patient in the first 8 weeks after ART initiation increased linearly for same-day ART to initiation on day 28. Small but statistically significant advantages of integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) over EFV and DRVr were found.Rapid, if not same-day initiation of INSTI-based ART to newly diagnosed HIV-infected MSM has the potential for substantial public health benefits related to decreases in HIV-TE."

There are relatively few data in the Asian population regarding the effects of hyperuricemia and gouty disorders on cardiac remodeling and diastolic dysfunction (DD), an intermediate stage in the development of heart failure. We consecutively recruited asymptomatic Asian individuals to undergo cardiovascular surveys. We categorized them into Non-HU, HU, and Gout groups. We measured cardiac structure and indices for diastolic function, including tissue Doppler (TDI)-derived LV e' and E/e'. Among 5525 participants, 1568 had HU and 347 had gout. The presence of gout and higher uric acid levels (SUA) (<4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10, > = 10 mg/dL) were associated with greater LV wall thickness, greater LV mass/volumes, larger LA volume, lower LV e' and higher E/e'. Higher SUA was associated with greater LV mass index (adjusted coefficient: 0.37), greater mass/volume ratio (adjusted coefficient: 0.01) and larger LA volume index (adjusted coefficient: 0.39, all p<0.05). Both HU and Gout groups were associated with lower LV e' (coefficient: -0.086, -0.05), higher E/e' (coefficient: 0.075, 0.35, all p <0.05), larger LA volume, and higher DD risk (adjusted ORs: 1.21 and 1.91 using Non-HU as reference, respectively, both p <0.05). SUA set at 7.0 mg/dL provided the optimal cut-off for identifying DD, with markedly lower e' (HU: 8.94 vs 8.07, Gout: 7.94 vs 7.26 cm/sec) and higher LV E/e' in HU/Gout women than in men (HU: 7.84 vs 9.79 cm/sec for men and women, respectively, all p <0.05). Hyperuricemia, even at a relatively low clinical cut-off, was associated with unfavorable remodeling and was tightly linked to diastolic dysfunction. The presence of gout likely aggravated these conditions. Women with hyperuricemia or gout had worse diastolic indices than men despite similar degrees of LV remodeling."

https://openalex.org/W3044492806,"Yeasts and fungi generate Ca2+ signals in response to environmental stresses through Ca2+ channels essentially composed of Cch1 and Mid1. Cch1 is homologous to the pore-forming α1 subunit of animal voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) and sodium leak channels nonselective (NALCNs), whereas Mid1 is a membrane-associated protein similar to the regulatory α2/δ subunit of VGCCs and the regulatory subunit of NALCNs. Although the physiological roles of Cch1/Mid1 channels are known, their molecular regulation remains elusive, including subunit interactions regulating channel functionality. Herein, we identify amino acid residues involved in interactions between the pore-forming Cch1 subunit and the essential regulatory Mid1 subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In vitro mutagenesis followed by functional assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that three residues present in a specific extracellular loop in the repeat III region of Cch1 are required for interaction with Mid1, and that one essential Mid1 residue is required for interaction with Cch1. Importantly, these residues are necessary for Ca2+ channel activity and are highly conserved in fungal and animal counterparts.

We discuss that this unique subunit interaction-based regulatory mechanism for Cch1 differs from that of VGCCs/NALCNs. Animal voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) are a family of multimeric transmembrane proteins composed of a pore-forming α1 subunit and three auxiliary subunits (α2/δ, β, and γ), and interactions between the α1 subunit and the three subunits are important for trafficking to the plasma membrane and functional modulation (1Catterall W.A.

Although animal VGCCs in excitable cells function as essential regulators of nerve activity and muscle contraction, the functions of their counterparts in yeast cells remains largely under-investigated, although they are known to play essential roles in responses to environmental stresses instead of voltage changes. The yeast Ca2+ channel is composed mainly of two essential subunits; Ca2+channel homolog 1 (Cch1) and mating pheromone-induced death 1 (Mid1). Cch1 is a homolog of the α1 subunit of animal VGCCs and recently characterized Na+ leak channels nonselective (NALCNs) (2Paidhungat M. Garrett S.

For example, Cch1 of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae shares only 24% amino acid sequence identity with mammalian L-type VGCCs, even though Cch1 shares several structural features of the α1 subunit, including molecular size, putative transmembrane topology, and domain structure (2Paidhungat M.

Specifically, like α1 subunits, the Cch1 subunit is composed of four repeats (I, II, III, and IV), each of which has six transmembrane segments (S1−S6) and a pore-forming region located between S5 and S6. However, unlike α1 subunits, the S4 segment of the repeat IV region in Cch1 lacks a set of voltage-sensing, positively-charged arginine or lysine residues, whereas Cch1 repeats I−III possess four sets of positively-charged amino acid residues (2Paidhungat M.

In particular, the extracellular loops connecting the S5 segment and the first half of the pore loop in repeats II and III (designated L5II and L5III, respectively) and the extracellular loop between the S1 and S2 segments of repeat I (designated L1-2I) were found to interact with a specific region of the α2/δ subunit (24Wu J.

Structure of the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav1.1 at 3.6 Å resolution.Nature. 2016; 537 (27580036): 191-19610.1038/nature19321Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). By contrast, interactions between Cch1 and Mid1 have not yet been characterized, even though they are essential for the Ca2+ permeation ability of Cch1. In the present study, we identified extracellular amino acid residues required for the interaction between Cch1 and Mid1 of S. cerevisiae. We focused on extracellular Cys residues of Cch1 and Mid1 because those of Cch1 are conserved in the Cch1/VGCC/NALCN family, and because Mid1 also has a conserved Cys-rich region. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of eight conserved, extracellular Cys residues of Cch1 revealed that two in repeat III are required for interaction with Mid1. Furthermore, PCR-based random mutagenesis of Cch1 repeat III identified three additional amino acid residues necessary for interaction with Mid1. Furthermore, one of 12 Cys residues in the Cys-rich region of Mid1 is required for interaction with Cch1. Based on these findings, we discuss the diversity and universality of the interaction between Cch1 and Mid1 subunits in yeast and their mammalian counterparts. To investigate the interaction between Cch1 and Mid1, we directed attention to the extracellular loops of Cch1. To determine the transmembrane topology of Cch1, we employed a combination of computational approaches using the web server TOPCONS (25Tsirigos K.D. Peters C. Shu N. Käll L. Elofsson A. The TOPCONS web server for combined membrane protein topology and signal peptide prediction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (25969446): W401-W40710.1093/nar/gkv485Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and data from cryo-EM analysis of rabbit VGCC (23Wu J.

This combination proved essential because the web servers we utilized, including TOPCONS, were unable to predict S4 segments as transmembrane regions due to the presence of four positively-charged Arg or Lys residues in each segment in repeats I−III. Using this combinatorial approach, we determined the transmembrane topology of Cch1 (Fig. 1A, Figs. S1 and S2) and identified nine Cys residues in the extracellular loops, eight of which were conserved in the extracellular loops of α1 subunits of animal VGCCs and NALCNs, and fungal Cch1 homologs (Fig. 1B); four in repeat I (Cys-587, Cys-606, Cys-636, and Cys-642), two in repeat III (Cys-1369 and Cys-1379), and two in repeat IV (Cys-1727 and Cys-1738). Importantly, Cys residues of animal VGCCs corresponding to the eight conserved Cys residues are involved in intra-loop disulfide bonding (24Wu J. Yan Z. Li Z. Qian X. Lu S. Dong M. Zhou Q. Yan N. Structure of the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav1.1 at 3.6 Å resolution.Nature. 2016; 537 (27580036): 191-19610.1038/nature19321Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and are necessary for ion channel integrity (26Stephens R.F. Guan W. Zhorov B.S. Spafford J.D. Selectivity filters and cysteine-rich extracellular loops in voltage-gated sodium, calcium, and NALCN channels.Front. Physiol. 2015; 6 (26042044): 15310.3389/fphys.2015.00153Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One of the nine Cys residues in repeat II, Cys-798, is not conserved, even in yeasts and fungi, and was not subsequently examined. Note that the transmembrane topology model is completely identical to those of animal VGCCs and NALCNs and partly differs from the previously proposed model of Cch1, in which the four Cys residues in repeat I is located in the cytoplasm (27Chandel A. Bachhawat A.K. Redox regulation of the yeast voltage-gated Ca2+ channel homolog Cch1p by glutathionylation of specific cysteine rresidues.J.

To examine the contribution of the eight Cys residues to channel activity, we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis studies. Low-copy plasmids carrying CCH1 promoter:CCH1 genes with Cys-to-Ala substitutions were constructed and used to transform the cch1Δ mutant defective in both cell viability maintenance and Ca2+ accumulation activity after exposure to the mating pheromone α-factor, an activator of the Cch1/Mid1 channel (2Paidhungat M.

We then assessed the Ca2+ permeability of the resulting mutant Cch1 proteins by measuring Ca2+ accumulation in the transformants after exposure to α-factor. Fig. 2A shows that all eight substitution mutants (C587A, C606A, C636A, C642A, C1369A, C1379A, C1727A, and C1738A) showed low Ca2+ accumulation comparable with the cch1Δ mutant carrying an empty vector, suggesting that all eight proteins had lost Ca2+ permeation activity. Based on the previous observation that Ca2+ accumulation activity is quantitatively correlated with the viability of cch1 mutants (16Iida K. Teng J. Cho T. Yoshikawa-Kimura S. Iida H.

It is conceivable that the apparent loss of Ca2+ permeation activity by the mutant Cch1 proteins could be due to low cellular content and/or mislocalization. To examine this possibility, we evaluated the cellular content for each of the proteins by Western blotting. Fig. 2C shows that the cellular content for each of the eight mutant Cch1 proteins was similar to that of WT Cch1. To analyze the subcellular localization of the mutant Cch1 proteins, we fused the gene encoding enhanced GFP (EGFP) to the C terminus in the low-copy plasmid carrying the strong TDH3 promoter (29Nacken V. Achstetter T. Degryse E. Probing the limits of expression levels by varying promoter strength and plasmid copy number in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Gene. 1996; 175 (8917107): 253-26010.1016/0378-1119(96)00171-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which allowed high-level expression of the fused Cch1-EGFP proteins, thereby enabling us to observe their subcellular localization by fluorescent microscopy (28Iida K.

Fig. 2D shows that all eight mutant Cch1 proteins tagged with EGFP were localized at the plasma membrane and the ER membrane, similar to the WT Cch1-EGFP protein. This subcellular localization is consistent with previous reports (30Iida K. Tada T. Iida H. Molecular cloning in yeast by in vivo homologous recombination of the yeast putative α1 subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel.FEBS Lett. 2004; 576 (15498550): 291-29610.1016/j.febslet.2004.09.021Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, the above possibility is unlikely. The ER localization of the Cch1-EGFP proteins may be due to their overexpression under the control of the TDH3 promoter (28Iida K. Teng J. Tada T. Saka A.

Taken together, the results indicate that all eight conserved extracellular Cys residues are required for Cch1 activity. The above results do not necessarily indicate that all eight Cys-Ala mutations are loss-of-permeability mutations; it is also possible that some of the mutations reduce the ability of the mutant Cch1 proteins to interact with Mid1 while maintaining Ca2+ permeability. To examine this possibility, we employed a protein overexpression approach. Because the Cch1–Mid1 interaction must be dependent on the stoichiometry of both proteins, overexpression of mutant Cch1 proteins with reduced interacting ability might improve the Ca2+ accumulation activity of the cch1Δ mutant, which possesses one copy of the genomic MID1+ gene. This experiment could identify extracellular Cys residues that take part in the interaction with Mid1. We therefore constructed plasmids from which the eight cch1 mutant genes described above were transcribed under the control of the TDH3 promoter, and transformed the cch1Δ mutant separately with each plasmid. Under our experimental conditions, the TDH3 promoter resulted in a ∼50-fold increase in Cch1 protein abundance compared with the CCH1 promoter (28Iida K. Teng J. Tada T. Saka A. Tamai M.

We first examined the viability of the eight transformants and found that C1369A and C1379A proteins exhibited a weak but significant ability to enhance the viability of the cch1Δ mutant, whereas the other six (C587A, C606A, C636A, C642A, C1727A, and C1738A) showed no activity (data not shown). Essentially the same results were obtained for Ca2+ accumulation experiments; as shown in Fig. 3A, the C1369A and C1379A proteins displayed higher Ca2+ permeation activity than the control (vector), whereas C636A, C642A, C1727A, and C1738A proteins showed no activity. Based on the results of both viability and Ca2+ accumulation experiments, we suggest that C587A, C606A, C636A, C642A, C1727A, and C1738A mutations are loss-of-permeability mutations. The above results also suggest that C1369A and C1379A proteins possess Ca2+ permeability activity but lack the full ability to interact with Mid1, whereas C587A, C606A, C636A, C642, C1727A, and C1738A proteins do not possess Ca2+ permeability activity but may be able to interact with Mid1, and this interaction would render these six proteins able to compete with WT Cch1 to interact with Mid1. Therefore, it is possible that overexpression of the former two proteins in CCH1+ cells may not interfere with the ability of WT Cch1 to interact with Mid1, whereas overexpression"
https://openalex.org/W3044847185,"After more than four decades of research and almost 100 attachment studies, the mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of attachment still remain unclear. To better understand the mechanisms moderating the associations of attachment orientations from one generation to the next, this empirical study examined the roles of 1) shared and non-shared environmental factors that characterize critical events in adulthood such as career choice, income and child care; 2) gender differences in attachment between parents (Generation 1, G1) and their adult offspring (Generation 2, G2) and their possible interactions. A sample of 321 families with G2 adults aged 18 and over and two G1 parents up to the age of 81 took part in this study. Both generations completed the Experiences in Close Relationships attachment measure as well as a comprehensive detailed measure of current core characteristics in adulthood (e.g. employment status, income, whether they had children) and demographic variables (gender, age). The findings suggest that the associations between the attachment orientations of G1 and the attachment orientations of G2 were moderated by G2's income, their G1 paternal income and employment status, whether G2 had children (G3) of their own, and their family status after controlling for the age of G2, and the age of both paternal and maternal G1. When the associations for both paternal and maternal G1attachment orientation with both their male and female G2 was analyzed separately, this accounted for 35% of the variance of males' G2 attachment orientation. The discussion focuses on the contribution of these findings to attachment theory and draws clinical conclusions."
https://openalex.org/W3043291399,"Thrombospondin-4 (TSP4) is a pro-angiogenic protein that has been implicated in tissue remodeling and local vascular inflammation. TSP4 and, in particular, its SNP variant, P387 TSP4, have been associated with cardiovascular disease. Macrophages are central to initiation and resolution of inflammation and development of atherosclerotic lesions, but the effects of the P387 TSP4 on macrophages remain essentially unknown. We examined the effects of the P387 TSP4 variant on macrophages in cell culture and in vivo in a murine model of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the levels and distributions of the two TSP4 variants were assessed in human atherosclerotic arteries. In ApoE- /- /P387-TSP4 knock-in mice, lesions size measured by Oil Red O did not change, but the lesions accumulated more macrophages than lesions bearing A387 TSP4. The levels of inflammatory markers were increased in lesions of ApoE- / - /P387-TSP4 knock-in mice compared to ApoE- / - mice. Lesions in human arteries from individuals carrying the P387 variant had higher levels of TSP4 and higher macrophage accumulation. P387 TSP4 was more active in supporting adhesion of cultured human and mouse macrophages in experiments using recombinant TSP4 variants and in cells derived from P387-TSP4 knock-in mice. TSP4 supports the adhesion of macrophages and their accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions without changing the size of lesions. P387 TSP4 is more active in supporting these pro-inflammatory events in the vascular wall, which may contribute to the increased association of P387 TSP4 with cardiovascular disease."
