https://openalex.org/W1990058718,"Free-ranging crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) that ate chicken eggs that were painted green and contained a nonlethal toxin subsequently avoided green eggs at various locations, whether or not they contained toxin. The crows also continued to eat unpainted and nontoxic chicken eggs. Illness-induced aversions among predators in nature may be a powerful determiner of the evolution of Batesian mimicry and, in human hands, serve as a practical tool for wildlife ecologists."
https://openalex.org/W1976689134,"Bacteria-free suspensions of larvae of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Stimpson) were prepared without the use of antibiotics. Net rates of removal of 18 amino acids, each supplied at 125 nanomoles per liter, and the appearance of ammonia were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Taurine and acidic and basic amino acids were not taken up. Removal of neutral amino acids from the medium occurred at rates adequate to contribute to the carbon and nitrogen balance of the larvae at ecologically relevant substrate concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W2079791416,"Larvae and adults of the marine bryozoan Watersipora cucullata invariably possess numerous extracellular mycoplasma-like, organisms. Mesodermally encapsulated groups of these atypical bacteria occur in the visceral coeloms of all colony members. In contrast, thousands of the symbionts are externally attached to each larva along a unique superficial groove; the microorganisms are internalized during the complex metamorphosis, thus inoculating the incipient colony. The consequences to the bryozoan of this association are not known."
