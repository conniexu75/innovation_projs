https://openalex.org/W2002017151,"Femtomole amounts of racemic mixtures of derivatized amino acids were resolved and analyzed rapidly in about 10 minutes by means of high-voltage zone electrophoresis with laser-fluorescence detection. The electrophoresis was performed in capillary columns containing a chiral support electrolyte. A number of dansyl amino acids were resolved by the diastereomeric interaction between the DL-amino acid and the copper(II) complex of L-histidine present in the support electrolyte. A combination of electro-osmotic and electrophoretic action caused all species, positively charged, neutral, and negatively charged, to pass through the 0.5- nanoliter detection volume where they were subjected to laser excitation."
https://openalex.org/W1975019974,Cyanobacterial picoplankton contribute substantially to oceanic primary productivity. The colored protein phycoerythrin is the major component of their light-harvesting apparatus. It was found that in Synechococcus strain DC2 a variable proportion of the light energy absorbed by phycoerythrin is lost as autofluorescence and therefore is not passed to a photoreaction center. Phycoerythrin may serve two functionally distinct roles in this organism: as a nitrogen reserve and as a collector of quanta for photosynthesis.

The rate and extent of dry matter disappearance were markedly increased as a result of the treatment. Results in vivo indicate that this treatment increases the fermentability of wheat straw structural carbohydrates such that this agricultural by-product may be considered an acceptable energy source for the ruminant animal. Treatment of wheat straw allowed more complete bacterial colonization and more rapid degradation of the cell wall."
https://openalex.org/W1975126385,"A digitonin-solubilized cellulose synthase was prepared from Acetobacter xylinum. When this enzyme was incubated under conditions known to lead to active synthesis of 1,4-beta-D-glucan polymer (cellulose), electron microscopy revealed that clusters of fibrils were assembled within minutes. Individual fibrils are 17 +/- 2 angstroms in diameter. Evidence that the fibrils were freshly synthesized and cellulosic in nature was their incorporation of the tritium from UDP-[(3)H]glucose (UDP, uridine 5'-diphosphate), their binding of gold-labeled cellobiohydrolase, and an electron diffraction pattern with 004, 200, and 012 reflections (characteristic of cellulose synthesized in vivo) but missing 110 and 110 reflections. The small size of the fibrils is atypical of native A. xylinum cellulose microfibrils. The fibrils synthesized in vitro resemble, in morphology and size, the fibrillar cellulose produced when A. xylinum is cultured in the presence of agents that interfere with the normal process of crystallization of the microfibrils. The solubilized enzyme unit may therefore be producing a basic fibrillar structure that, in vivo, interacts laterally with other fibrils to produce native cellulose microfibrils."

https://openalex.org/W2063016531,"The synthetic molecular oxygen carrier O(2)lrCl(CO)(P[C(6)H(5)](3))(2), discovered by Vaska, has been characterized in a complete molecular structure determination. The structure surmised by Vaska from spectroscopic data has been confirmed and, in addition, definitive details on the attachment of molecular oxygen to iridium in this 1 : 1 reversible oxygen carrier have been obtained. The two oxygen atoms are equidistant from the metal atom, as in Griffith's model of the oxygen atoms in oxyhemoglobin. The O-O bond length of 1.30 +/- 0.03 A is intermediate between those characteristic of O(2) (1.20 A) and O(2)(-2) (1.48 A), and corresponds closely to O(2)(-)(1.28 A)."
https://openalex.org/W2063547790,"The Colorado potato beetle spiroplasma, which is not cultivable in conventional cell-free media, grew in tissue culture media in the presence of several coleopteran and lepidopteran insect cell lines. The cultured organisms attained titers of 1.2 x 10(9) spiroplasmas per milliliter of culture at the 100th passage and retained infectivity and a high capacity for translational motility at the 15th passage. Cell culture systems may facilitate the isolation of other presently uncultivable microorganisms and may be useful in the study of the role of microbial physiology and behavior in pathogenicity."

The kinetic analysis of the reactions as well as the measured values of G(H(2)O(2)), G(Br(2)), and G(Br(3)(-)) revealed a reaction mechanism differing from the one which is accepted for radiolysis at low intensity."

The cleaning phenomenon may be commonplace in the natural environment along the Atlantic seaboard. The black sea bass, Centropristes striatus (Linn.), parasitized by the copepod, Lernaeenicus radiatus (Le Sueur), was cleaned by a topminnow, Fundulus heteroclitus (Linn.). The behavior was recorded by cinematography and analyzed."

https://openalex.org/W2028293865,Reported accretion rates for cosmic spherules ranging in diameter from 1 to 400 micro appear to increase with increasing latitude. The apparent variation is most closely related to geomagnetic latitude. Preliminary culations suggest that electromagnetic interactions could cause only charged particles less than about 10-(2) micro in diameter to impinge preferentially at high latitudes.
