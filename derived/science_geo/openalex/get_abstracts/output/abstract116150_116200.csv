https://openalex.org/W2170051746,"The rapid and spontaneous interaction between superoxide ( O2•¯ ) and nitric oxide (NO) to yield the potent oxidants peroxynitrite (ONOO-) and peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH), has been suggested to represent an important pathway by which tissue may be injured during inflammation. Although several groups of investigators have demonstrated substantial oxidizing and cytotoxic activities of chemically synthesized ONOO-, there has been little information available quantifying the interaction between O2•¯ and NO in the absence or the presence of redox-active iron. Using the hypoxanthine (HX)/xanthine oxidase system to generate various fluxes of O2•¯ and H2O2 and the spontaneous decomposition of the spermine/NO adduct to produce various fluxes of NO, we found that in the absence of redox-active iron, the simultaneous production of equimolar fluxes of O2•¯ and NO increased the oxidation of dihydrorhodamine (DHR) from normally undetectable levels to approximately 15 μM, suggesting the formation of a potent oxidant. Superoxide dismutase, but not catalase, inhibited this oxidative reaction, suggesting that O2•¯ and not hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) interacts with NO to generate a potent oxidizing agent. Excess production of either radical virtually eliminated the oxidation of DHR. In the presence of 5 μM Fe+3-EDTA to insure optimum O2•¯ -driven Fenton chemistry, NO enhanced modestly HX/xanthine oxidase-induced oxidation of DHR. As expected, both superoxide dismutase and catalase inhibited this Fe-catalyzed oxidation reaction. Excess NO production with respect to O2•¯ flux produced only modest inhibition (33%) of DHR oxidation. In a separate series of studies, we found that equimolar fluxes of O2•¯ and NO in the absence of iron only modestly enhanced hydroxylation of benzoic acid from undetectable levels to 0.6 μM 2-hydroxybenzoate. In the presence of 5 μM Fe+3-EDTA, HX/xanthine oxidase-mediated hydroxylation of benzoic acid increased dramatically from undetectable levels to 4.5 μM of the hydroxylated product. Superoxide dismutase and catalase were both effective at inhibiting this classic O2•¯ -driven Fenton reaction. Interestingly, NO inhibited this iron-catalyzed hydroxylation reaction in a concentration-dependent manner such that fluxes of NO approximating those of O2•¯ and H2O2 virtually abolished the hydroxylation of benzoic acid. We conclude that in the absence of iron, equimolar fluxes of NO and O2•¯ interact to yield potent oxidants such as ONOO-/ONOOH, which oxidize organic compounds. Excess production of either radical remarkably inhibits these oxidative reactions. In the presence of low molecular weight redox-active iron complexes, NO may enhance or inhibit O2•¯ -dependent oxidation and hydroxylation reactions depending upon their relative fluxes.

https://openalex.org/W2074585020,"F4/80 is a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a murine macrophage-restricted cell surface glycoprotein and has been extensively used to characterize macrophage populations in a wide range of immunological studies. Apart from the tightly regulated pattern of expression of the F4/80 antigen, little is known about its possible role in macrophage differentiation and function. We have sought to characterize the molecule at the molecular level, through the isolation of cDNA clones, and now describe the sequence of the F4/80 protein. The primary amino acid sequence demonstrates homology to two protein superfamilies. The NH2-terminal region consists of seven epidermal growth factor-like domains, separated by approximately 300 amino acids from a COOH-terminal region that shows homology to members of the seven transmembrane-spanning family of hormone receptors. The potential role of these distinct domains is discussed with respect to the possible function of the F4/80 molecule.

Macrophages play a crucial role in the initiation and effector stages of both innate and adaptive immune responses. A number of specialized cell surface molecules expressed by macrophages participate in these responses, such as macrophage mannose receptor, macrophage scavenger receptor, complement receptor 3 (CD11b/CD18), and opsonic Fc receptors for antigen-specific immunoglobulins. One of the most highly restricted macrophage membrane molecules is defined by the monoclonal antibody F4/80, which recognizes a 160-kDa glycoprotein on the surface of most mouse macrophage populations(1.Austyn J.M. Gordon S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). The F4/80 mAb 1The abbreviations used are: mAbmonoclonal antibodyPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)EGFepidermal growth factor. has been extensively used in a range of immunohistochemical studies of development in normal mice and in a number of pathologic models as a macrophage-specific marker (2.Hume D.A.

To date, no defined function has been ascribed to F4/80, although its expression is known to be down-regulated by interferon-γ and in response to Bacille Calmette-Guérin infection(7.Ezekowitz R.A.B. Austyn J. Stahl P.D. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 154: 60-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 8.Ezekowitz R.A.B. Gordon S. J. Exp.

This further suggests that T cells, or a T cell-derived product, may play a role in the regulation of F4/80 expression. The lack of F4/80 expression on migrating veiled cells, derived from F4/80+ Langerhans cells within the skin epidermis, and the low level of expression on blood monocytes (6.Gordon S. Lawson L.

As a means of delineating the physiologic role of F4/80 on mature macrophages, we have successfully isolated F4/80 cDNA clones. Herein we report that the primary amino acid sequence of F4/80 shows a degree of homology to two protein superfamilies: the extracellular NH2-terminal region contains seven EGF-like repeats, while the final third of the molecule shows homology to members of the seven transmembrane (Tm7) hormone receptor family. monoclonal antibody polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) epidermal growth factor. The mAbs F4/80 (rat IgG2b), 5C1 (rat IgG1; anti-mouse F4/80), CAMPATH-9 (rat IgG2b; anti-human CD4; a kind gift of Dr. Steve Cobbold, Sir William Dunn School of Pathology), and MRC OX-20 (rat IgG1; anti-mouse Igκ; a kind gift of Mike Puklavec, Cellular Immunology Unit, Sir William Dunn School of Pathology) were used in the form of purified IgG or as hybridoma supernatant. The rabbit anti-mouse F4/80 antiserum was raised against purified F4/80 antigen and has been described elsewhere(10.Starkey P.M. Turley L. Gordon S. Immunology. 1987; 60: 117-122PubMed Google Scholar). A number of murine cell lines were used: J774.2 (macrophage), RAW 264.7 (macrophage), NS0 (myeloma), NIH-3T3 (fibroblast), L929 (fibroblast), PG19 (melanoma), BW5147 (thymoma), WEHI-231 (B cell lymphoma), CTLL-2 (IL-2 dependent T cell), J558L (myeloma), and MEL 707 (erythroleukemia). CHO-K1 cells were used in transfection assays. F4/80 antigen was purified by Triton X-100 lysis from the J774.2 cell line, grown as a tumor in the peritoneal cavity of BALB/c mice. The pelleted tumor mass was homogenized on a Polytron tissue grinder in a solution consisting of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 3 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 700 × g for 7 min to remove the nuclear pellet, which was discarded, and at 100,000 × g for 30 min to collect the membrane-rich fraction. The sample was then extracted with lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA, 5 mM NaN3, and the protease inhibitors at 4°C for 30 min, before spinning at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and stored at −70°C. Before use, the extracts were thawed, and, after the addition of 1 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, they were precleared at 100,000 × g for 30 min before passing sequentially through a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and a bovine IgG-Sepharose CL4B precolumn followed by a 5C1-Sepharose CL4B affinity column equilibrated with lysis buffer. After washing, the 5C1 column was eluted with 50 mM diethylamine, pH 11.5, and fractions containing the majority of the protein, as assessed by absorbance at 280 nm, were neutralized with 2 M glycine, pH 2.0, and pooled. The sample was passed over a second 5C1 affinity column, washed, and eluted as before, and the eluate was concentrated over a 100-kDa cut-off Spectra/Por membrane (Pierce and Warriner, Chester, UK), filtered through a 0.2-μm filter, and stored at 4°C. Minor contaminants were removed by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis incorporating excision of the antigen band and electroelution. On analytical SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the final antigen preparation displayed a major homogeneous band, and a minor one possibly corresponding to the precursor form of the molecule. The antigen was reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin, from which peptides were subjected to amino acid sequence analysis by gas-phase sequencing. A cDNA library was constructed in the λZAPII vector (Stratagene Ltd., Cambridge, UK) using oligo(dT)-primed cDNA from the J774.2 cell line. Approximately 1 × 106 plaques were screened with rabbit anti-mouse F4/80 polyclonal antiserum and detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Positive plaques were enriched following a further two rounds of screening, resulting in 10 independent clones that were isolated in pBluescriptII-SK(-). The clone containing the largest insert, pF4/80(12.2), was sequenced to obtain unambiguous overlapping readings from both strands. 5′ Rapid amplification of cDNA ends nested PCR using oligonucleotide-anchored spleen cDNA template, in the presence of an anchor-specific primer and (primary PCR) an antisense primer complementary to residues 200-171 of pF4/80(12.2), followed by (secondary PCR) an antisense primer complementary to residues 146-120 of pF4/80(12.2), was performed to characterize the 5′ region of the F4/80 cDNA. The PCR conditions were as follows: 50-μl final reaction volume containing 2 mM MgCl2, 200 μM dNTP, 10 μM each primer, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison WI), 2 μl of anchored cDNA (primary PCR), or 2 μl of 10-fold diluted primary amplified product (secondary PCR), using the following cycling parameters 94°C/45 s, 60°C/45 s, 72°C/2 min for a total of 30 cycles. A 230-bp fragment was amplified, which overlapped clone 12.2 and included novel sequence encoding the initiator methionine and amino acid residues 1-4. 15 μg of total RNA from a range of mouse cell lines (listed above) was subjected to electrophoresis through a denaturing 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to a Genescreen Plus membrane (DuPont NEN). The filter was probed with a 32P-labeled ClaI-ApaI cDNA fragment (757 bp) excised from clone pF4/80(12.2), washed with 1 × SSC, 1% SDS at 60°C and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Corp.) at −70°C. A PCR fragment encoding the full-length F4/80 open reading frame was amplified, with clone pF4/80(12.2) as a template, using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′ TAG TAG AAG CTT AGT ACG ATG TGG GGC TTT TGG CTG CTC CTC TTC TGG GGC TTC AG 3′, which contains sequence (in boldface) corresponding to the first 13 amino acids of the F4/80 precursor protein as well as a HindIII restriction enzyme site (underlined), and 5′ TAG TAG TCT AGA GAA AGG ATG TTA ACC CAT CTT GGA AGT GG 3′, which contains sequence (in boldface/antisense) located at the end of the F4/80 cDNA open reading frame, including the translation termination codon, as well as an XbaI restriction enzyme site (underlined). PCR conditions were as follows: 100-μl reaction volume containing 1 mM MgSO4, 200 μM dNTP, 50 μM each primer, 3 units of Vent® DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly MA), 100 ng of pF4/80(12.2) using the following cycling parameters 94°C/1 min, 55°C/1 min, 75°C/3 min for a total of 35 cycles. The amplified fragment was subcloned into HindIII-XbaI-digested pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and the construct was stably transfected into CHO-K1 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique(11.Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. II. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1985: 143-190Google Scholar). Following transfection, cells were dispensed into 96-well flat bottomed microtitre plates, and clones selected with 250 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). A control construct, pcDNA3/β-galactosidase, was kindly provided by Dr. David Greaves, Sir William Dunn School of Pathology. Cells were stained with F4/80 or 5C1, or isotype matched control mAbs (CAMPATH-9 and OX-20), diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (10 μg/ml) at 4°C for 30 min, washed, and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-rat IgG (Boehringer Mannheim) before analyzing on a FACScan® (Becton Dickinson & Co., Mountain View, CA). The macrophage cell line J774.2 has been shown previously to express high levels of the F4/80 antigen(1.Austyn J.M. Gordon S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 10.Starkey P.M. Turley L. Gordon S. Immunology. 1987; 60: 117-122PubMed Google Scholar), and, as such, an unamplified cDNA library was constructed with poly(A)+ RNA from this source in the λZAPII vector and screened using rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against purified F4/80 antigen. Following a further two rounds of screening, 10 positive clones were isolated and characterized by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. None of the clones appeared to contain a full-length cDNA coding sequence, as witnessed by the lack of an in-frame ATG at their 5′ end. A 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR strategy was therefore applied, utilizing antisense oligonucleotide primers specific for internal sequence within clone pF4/80(12.2) to amplify a cDNA fragment that overlapped pF4/80(12.2) and encoded 46 bp of novel 5′ sequence including the ATG initiation codon. The overall composite sequence consists of 3286 bp, including a stretch of 49 adenosines corresponding to the poly(A) tail and an upstream AATAAA motif. The open reading frame encodes a precursor of 931 amino acids with a predicted signal peptide of 27 residues(12.von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3685) Google Scholar), resulting in a mature protein of 904 amino acids with a predicted mass of 98.9 kDa (Fig. 1A). On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, F4/80 appears as a smear of approximately 160 kDa, which, together with the mass differential from the deduced sequence, suggests extensive glycosylation of the molecule. The presence of 10 potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) and a region highly rich in Ser and Thr residues (Fig. 1A, amino acids 399-642) suggests that the protein is heavily N- and O-glycosylated in agreement with earlier studies. The predicted amino acid sequence also contained four tryptic peptides obtained from the purified protein, ranging from 64 to 96% similarity (Table 1). To confirm that the cloned cDNA encoded the F4/80 protein, Northern blot analysis was performed using RNA from a range of mouse cell lines and screened with a 757-bp probe from clone pF4/80(12.2). Fig. 2 demonstrates that the transcript recognized by this probe is expressed exclusively in cells of the macrophage lineage, in accordance with the well documented macrophage-specific expression pattern of F4/80. The level of mRNA expression in J774.2 cells is also higher than in RAW 264.7 cells, which correlates with the increased level of F4/80 surface expression on the J774.2 line. The approximate size of the mRNA species (3.2 kb) also correlated well with the size of the cloned cDNA. As further evidence of the identity of the cDNA, CHO-K1 cells were transfected with a full-length expression construct in the pcDNA3 vector. Following selection with Geneticin, cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for F4/80 antigen expression using the noncompetitive mAbs F4/80 and 5C1 (Fig. 3). The 5C1 mAb was raised against purified F4/80 antigen and has not been described previously. Compared with cells transfected with a control pcDNA3/β-galactosidase construct, the pcDNA3/F4/80 transfectants demonstrated detectable surface expression of the F4/80 antigen.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 2:Northern blot analysis of F4/80 mRNA expression in mouse cell lines. 15 μg of total RNA from each cell line was electrophoresed through a 1.2% denaturing agarose gel, transferred to a Genescreen Plus membrane and probed with a 757-bp fragment from pF4/80(12.2) (top panel).

First, the NH2-terminal region of the protein contains seven tandem EGF-like domains(13.Campbell I.D. Bork P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar). These repeats of approximately 50 amino acids are characterized by the spatial arrangement of six cysteine residues that form three disulfide bonds within each domain, thereby generating a tightly folded structure. A search of the SwissProt and NBRF-PIR data bases with the F4/80 sequence identified a high degree of homology to a number of proteins containing EGF repeats, with the highest scores between F4/80 and connective tissue components such as fibrillin 1 (14.Maslen C.L. Corson G.M. Maddox B.K. Glanville R.W. Sakai L.Y. Nature. 1991; 352: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and fibulin 2(15.Pan T.-C. Sasaki T. Zhang R.-Z. Fassler R. Timpl R. Chu M.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As well as the six invariant cysteines, five of the EGF-like domains contain consensus motifs implicated in Ca2+ binding(16.Handford P.A. Mayhew M. Baron B. Winship P.R. Campbell I.D. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1991; 351: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), which may play a role in stabilizing the conformation required for ligand interaction. Preliminary analysis of the mouse F4/80 gene demonstrates that each separate EGF-like domain is encoded by a single exon as described for the genomic organization of other EGF superfamily members. 2A. J. McKnight, A. J. MacFarlane, and S. Gordon, unpublished results. A role for EGF-like domains in numerous protein-protein interactions has been proposed, such as the critical requirement of two EGF repeats in the neurogenic Drosophila protein Notch for its interaction with the Delta and Serrate proteins(17.Rebay I. Fleming R.J. Fehon R.G. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1991; 67: 687-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The second region of homology identified between F4/80 and members of a protein superfamily is located at the COOH-terminal region of the F4/80 protein. A hydropathy profile of the F4/80 sequence (18.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar) demonstrated an abundance of hydrophobic residues within a region of approximately 250 COOH-terminal amino acids (Fig. 4), suggesting that the molecule may span the cell membrane a number of times. Protein data base searches identified significant homology scores between F4/80 and members of the Tm7 hormone receptor family, including the receptors for peptidic hormones such as parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, glucagon, and secretin(19.Segre G.V. Goldring S.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 309-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This recently described receptor family shares a common overall topology with an extracellular NH2 terminus, an intracellular COOH terminus, and a central region consisting of seven transmembrane segments, which results in three external loops and three internal loops. Characteristic residues were found to be conserved between F4/80 and the members of this particular subset of Tm7 receptors in the transmembrane segments (with the exception of Tm6), the three intracellular loops and the cytoplasmic tail immediately following Tm7. In addition, F4/80, in common with the other members of the family, contains a cysteine residue in each of the first and second extracellular loops. The formation of a disulfide bridge between these cysteines is believed to be crucial to the overall tertiary structure of the receptors. The Tm7 receptors interact with heterotrimeric α-β-γ G-proteins, on the cytosolic surface of the membrane, which are involved in signal transduction following ligand binding to the extracellular loops of the Tm7 molecule(20.Watson S. Arkinstall S. The G-protein-linked Receptor Factsbook. Academic Press, London1994Google Scholar). The F4/80 ligand, and function, remains unknown, and its identification will determine whether F4/80 serves as a receptor for a hormone involved in macrophage differentiation and function. The presence of seven EGF-like repeats in the NH2-terminal region of F4/80 is an unusual divergence for Tm7 molecules which, with a limited number of exceptions (20.Watson S. Arkinstall S. The G-protein-linked Receptor Factsbook. Academic Press, London1994Google Scholar, 21.Reichert L.E. Dattatreyamurty B. Grasso P. Coloma T.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 199-203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), have relatively short NH2 termini with no defined protein superfamily domains. We suggest that F4/80 possibly interacts with two separate ligands, via the EGF-like domains and an extracellular portion of the Tm7 multispan region, respectively. This notion is strengthened by the presence of an Arg-Gly-Asp motif (Fig. 1A; amino acids 506-508), often found in matrix proteins with multiple EGF repeats, which could play a role in cell adhesion following recognition by an integrin molecule(22.D'Souza S.E.

Based upon the structural elements and macrophage-restricted expression pattern of the molecule, we propose that F4/80 is involved in macrophage adhesion within tissues combined with receptor signaling following its interaction with a peptide ligand, possibly resulting in the activation of adenylate cyclase and increased intracellular cAMP levels(19.Segre G.V. Goldring S.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 309-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This receptor activity may therefore influence macrophage responses within a defined tissue microenvironment. A recent report has described the cloning of a cell surface molecule (designated EMR1) from a human neuroectodermal cDNA library, which shows an extremely high degree of similarity to the F4/80 sequence described here(23.Baud V. Chissoe S.L. Viegas-Péquignot E. Diriong S. N'Guyen V.C. Roe B.A. Lipinski M. Genomics. 1995; 26: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This sequence shows 68% overall identity to F4/80 and contains six EGF-repeats and seven postulated transmembrane segments. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis suggests that expression of the EMR1 molecule is not as tightly regulated as F4/80 is in mice, although increased levels of EMR1 transcripts appear to be expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The wide distribution of EMR1 expression, in comparison with the restricted pattern of F4/80 expression, is intriguing. The development of mAbs directed to the human protein will aid greatly in defining the localization of cells expressing this molecule, as will in situ hybridization studies on normal human tissue sections. The deduced structure of the F4/80 and EMR1 proteins suggests a role in the cellular response to an undefined hormone or an interaction, possibly through the EGF-like repeats, with an alternative protein ligand. The identification of the F4/80 ligand(s) will help to elucidate the function of this specialized molecule in macrophage physiology. We thank Drs. Neil Barclay, David Greaves, Susan Mallett, and Steve Watson for advice and helpful discussions."

NF-κB is readily activated from normally inhibited cytoplasmic stores by induced proteolytic degradation of IκB-α, a principal inhibitor of this transcription factor. Following the inhibitor's degradation, NF-κB is free to translocate to the nucleus and induce gene transcription. The IκB-α inhibitor is targeted for degradation by signal-induced phosphorylation of two closely spaced serines in its NH2 terminus (Ser32 and Ser36). Proteolytic degradation appears to be carried out by proteasomes which can recognize ubiquitinated intermediates of the IκB-α inhibitor. We provide evidence which supports a ubiquitin-mediated mechanism. Amino acid substitutions of two adjacent potential ubiquitination sites in the NH2 terminus of IκB-α (Lys21 and Lys22) almost completely block the rapid, signal-induced degradation of the mutant protein, while they do not interfere with induced phosphorylation. The mutant IκB-α also does not permit signal-induced activation of NF-κB bound to it. The data suggest that ubiquitination at either of the two adjacent lysines (21 and 22) is required for degradation following induced phosphorylation at nearby serines 32 and 36. Such dependence on ubiquitination of specific sites for protein degradation is unusual. This mechanism of degradation may also apply to IκB-β, an inhibitor related to and functionally overlapping with IκB-α, as well as to cactus, an IκB homolog of Drosophila.

INTRODUCTIONThe transcription factor complexes known collectively as NF-κB function primarily as mediators of inducible transcription in response to a variety of environmental signals (for recent reviews, see (1.Siebenlist U.

Stress- and pathogen-related signals in particular are known to activate NF-κB, leading to induced expression of a large number of genes, including many genes which encode functions relevant to immune responses. In most cell types, p50-p65 heterodimers represent the vast majority of the rapidly inducible NF-κB complexes, although several other NF-κB dimers may coexist and may become activated also. All NF-κB dimers are composed of members of the Rel/NF-κB family of polypeptides, and in vertebrates this family is comprised of p50 (NF-κB1), p65 (RelA), c-Rel, p52 (NF-κB2), and RelB. The various NF-κB dimers usually lie dormant in the cytoplasm of cells, kept there by inhibitory ankyrin-containing members of the IκB family of proteins, in particular IκB-α. IκB-α strongly associates with p50/p65 heterodimers and appears to shield the nuclear localization sequences contained in both subunits; this is presumed to be the mechanism by which this protein retains the heterodimers in the cytoplasm(6.Beg A.A.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Induced phosphorylation occurs on two closely spaced serines in the NH2 terminus of the protein (amino acids 32 and 36), mediated by an as yet unknown kinase(s)(25.Brown K. Gertsberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 26.Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5339-5345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that signal-induced phosphorylation can lead to ubiquitination of IκB-α(29.Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Since ubiquitin-tagged proteins are generally subject to proteasome-mediated proteolysis(30.Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar), these observations suggest that degradation of IκB-α is triggered by ubiquitination. However, a ubiquitin-independent mechanism of degradation is not necessarily excluded, since only a fraction of the total pool of IκB-α could be shown to be ubiquitinated (under conditions of proteolysis inhibition). Furthermore, precedents exist for a ubiquitin-independent, but proteasome-dependent degradation mechanism(31.Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S.-I. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to demonstrate ubiquitin-dependence by investigating the requirement for lysines in IκB-α degradation, because lysines are the sites at which ubiquitin is ligated(30.Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence which strongly suggests that rapid, signal-regulated degradation of IκB-α proceeds primarily via a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism. An IκB-α mutant bearing conservative substitutions at two potential ubiquitination sites is remarkably resistant to signal-regulated degradation. The results imply that two adjacent NH2-terminal lysines (Lys21 and Lys22) are the primary targets of signal-induced ubiquitination. That specific lysines play such an important role in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation is uncommon(30.Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar).MATERIALS AND METHODSSite-directed MutagenesisMutations in full-length, human IκB-α cDNA (32.Haskill S. Beg A.A.

Virol. 1993; 67: 288-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In each case, lysine codons were substituted with arginine codons (for positions 21, 22, 47 and 67: AAG was changed to AGG; for 38: AAA was changed to CGA; for 87: AAG was changed to CGG). The mutated IκB-α cDNAs were excised from a Bluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with EcoRI (1550 base pairs) and subcloned into the PMT2T mammalian expression vector(34.Israel D.I. Kaufmann R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4589-4604Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by subsequent DNA sequence analysis.Transient TransfectionsNtera-2, human embryonal carcinoma cells were transfected via calcium phosphate-mediated transfer as described elsewhere (35.Bours V.

Cells were stimulated with PMA (10 ng/ml) for 6 h prior to harvesting, stimulation starting at about 36 h post-transfection, and CAT activity was measured as previously described(25.Brown K.

Gertsberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of PMT2T-IκB-α DNA and 2 μg of neomycin-resistant plasmid DNA were electroporated into 107 EL-4 cells using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser, set at 250 V, 960 microfarads. Stable neomycin-resistant transfectants were selected after 3-4 weeks of incubation with geneticin (G418, Life Technologies, Inc.), used at 400 μg/ml during the first week and at 200 μg/ml thereafter. The resulting cell lines were screened for expression of human IκB-α using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against full-length IκB-α (10.Brown K. Park S. Kanno T. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U.

Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) and ECL technology (Amersham Corp.). Cells were stimulated with PMA (40 ng/ml) and ionomycin (2 μM), and calpain inhibitor I was used at 100 μM, starting 30 min prior to stimulation.RESULTSSince ubiquitin is ligated to proteins through lysine residues, we substituted the lysines in IκB-α by site-directed mutagenesis and tested the resulting mutant proteins for defects in signal-dependent degradation. Human IκB-α (Mad-3) contains lysine at positions 21, 22, 38, 47, 67, 87, 98, 177, and 238 (32.Haskill S. Beg A.A. Tompkins S.M. Morris J.S. Yurochko A.D. Sampson-Johannes A. Mondal K. Ralph P. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 1281-1289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Lysines 22, 38, 87, and 238 are perfectly conserved in pig, rat, and chicken (pp40) IκB-α; lysines 21, 47, 67, and 98 are absent in chicken; and lysine 177 is not conserved at all(39.de Martin R. Vanhove B. Cheng Q. Hofer E. Csizmadia V. Winkler H. Bach F.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We substituted each of the NH2-terminal lysines (21, 22, 38, 47, 67, and 87) and the pair, 21 + 22, with arginine residues to block ubiquitination of these sites which all lie near the inducibly phosphorylated serines 32 and 36. Arginine was chosen so as not to change the charge of the protein. As an initial test of the mutant proteins, we transiently transfected expression constructs for the various IκB-α mutants into Ntera-2 embryonal carcinoma cells, together with an expression construct for NF-κB/p65. Undifferentiated Ntera-2 cells do not express significant levels of endogenous NF-κB or IκB proteins and are thus ideal for evaluating the activities of the transfected proteins without interference by endogenous counterparts(33.Bressler P.

Transfected p65 potently transactivated a cotransfected κB-dependent CAT reporter, while coexpression of wild-type IκB-α or any of the lysine-substituted mutants severely inhibited p65-mediated transactivation (25.Brown K. Gertsberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Therefore, these mutations did not interfere with the inhibitory activity of the protein, which was expected, since inhibition does not require the NH2-terminal domain of IκB-α(25.Brown K. Gertsberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 41.Inoue J.I. Kerr L.D. Rashid D. Davis N. Bose Jr., H.R. Verma I.M.

We then tested whether the lysine mutations interfered with the signal-induced degradation of the proteins bearing them, as measured by the ability of a PMA stimulus to relieve inhibition and thus allow p65-mediated transactivation of the CAT reporter (Fig. 1; inducibility of mutants is shown as percent of inducibility of wild-type IκB-α; inducibility is measured as the ratio of CAT activity of PMA-stimulated cells/unstimulated cells). None of the individual lysine mutations significantly interfered with signal-induced transactivation, suggesting that no single lysine is critical for the signal-induced degradation of IκB-α (Fig. 1; column 1, wild-type (wt); columns 2, 3, 5-8, mutants K21R, K22R, K38R, K47R, K67R, and K87R (R21, R22, R38, R47, R67, and R87, respectively). However, an IκB-α mutant bearing substitutions at both lysines 21 and 22 (K21R/K22R (R21R22 mutant) had a dramatic effect; this mutant did not allow significant activation of NF-κB in PMA-stimulated, transfected Ntera-2 cells (Fig. 1, column 4). The data suggest that at least one of the two lysines at positions 21 and 22 has to be present for rapid signal-induced degradation of IκB-α to occur, since elimination of both lysines effectively blocked NF-κB activation, while substitution of either lysine alone was of little consequence.To confirm these interpretations and to rule out a potential defect in phosphorylation of the K21R/K22R mutant, we directly evaluated mutants for phosphorylation and degradation. Murine EL-4 T cells were permanently transfected with the various IκB-α mutants, and then the cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin. We showed previously that exogenously derived human IκB-α is subject to the same signal-induced phosphorylation and degradation as the endogenous murine IκB-α(25.Brown K. Gertsberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Endogenous murine IκB-α serves as an internal positive control in these experiments. Since it migrates slightly faster than the transfected human protein, both proteins could be simultaneously visualized(25.Brown K. Gertsberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Among the mutants tested, only the K21R/K22R mutant was resistant to signal-induced degradation in the EL-4 cells (Fig. 2), while all other transfected human (h) mutant proteins bearing individual lysine substitutions appeared to be degraded as efficiently as the endogenous murine (m) IκB-α (Fig. 2, K21R, K22R, K38R, K47R, K67R, and K87R (R21, R22, R38, R47, R67, and R87). All mutant proteins, including the double mutant K21R/K22R, were rapidly phosphorylated in response to signals, as indicated by the shift in mobility of IκB-α in the presence of calpain inhibitor I, which inhibits proteasomes (20.Palombella V.J.

This is as expected for the rapidly degraded IκB-α proteins. In the case of the double mutant (K21R/K22R), the proteasome inhibitors were not needed to see the phosphorylation, since this mutant was not efficiently degraded. The presence of the proteasome inhibitor did, however, increase the amount of the K21R/K22R IκB-α mutant observed, suggesting that these mutations may not completely block induced degradation. Nonetheless, the K21R/K22R mutation afforded this IκB-α significant protection from degradation, and the results are consistent with the Ntera-2 experiments shown in Fig. 1.Figure 2:Signal-induced degradation and phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant IκB-α expressed in stably transfected EL-4 cells. EL-4 murine T cells were permanently transfected with wild-type (wt) or mutated (mt), human (h) IκB-α expression vectors (see “Materials and Methods”), as indicated. Cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin (Iono) for 15 min in the presence (+) or absence of calpain inhibitor I (Calp. Inhib.), which inhibits proteasome activity. Both transfected human and endogenous murine (m) IκB-α, as well as the inducibly phosphorylated form of human IκB-α (IκB-αP) were visualized by Western analysis (see “Materials and Methods”). (The inducibly phosphorylated mutated IκB-α migrates to almost the same position as the uninduced form and is not readily distinguished here(25.Brown K. Gertsberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar).) Only the K21R/K22R (R21R22) mutation in human IκB-α blocked rapid degradation (while the murine wild-type protein was degraded in the same cells), which resulted in an accumulation of the inducibly phosphorylated form, even in the absence of proteasome inhibitors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated a critical requirement for the presence of either of two lysines at positions 21 and 22 in signal-induced degradation of IκB-α and, as a consequence, in signal-induced transactivation by NF-κB/p65. The substitution of both lysines 21 and 22 with arginines in IκB-α (K21R/K22R) caused a severe block to rapid signal-induced degradation of that IκB-α in stably transfected EL-4 cells. The mutant protein was, however, still phosphorylated at nearby serine sites (S32 and S36), indicating that the defect lies downstream of the phosphorylation step; it also suggests that the protein was not grossly altered by these conservative substitutions, since the kinase(s) acitivity on this substrate appears unaffected. The K21R/K22R mutant prevented the signal-induced, p65-mediated transactivation of a κB-dependent reporter in transient transfection experiments using Ntera-2 cells. In contrast to the K21R/K22R mutant, mutants bearing substitutions of individual lysines, including those at residue 21 or 22, had no measurable effect and behaved like wild type. Taken together these data demonstrate that either of the two lysines at positions 21 and 22 is necessary for rapid degradation (but not for phosphorylation) and they provide a compelling argument for obligatory ubiquitination prior to degradation of IκB-α: at least one of the two potential ubiquitination sites must be present for rapid signal-induced degradation to proceed. Although degradation is dramatically inhibited, it appears not to be absolutely blocked (see Fig. 2); this may indicate that ubiquitination can also occur at other sites, albeit less efficiently, or that another mechanism allows for a slower degradation. Finally, the data do not tell us if Lys21 or Lys22 are sufficient for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. It is possible, for example, that some other, not necessarily specific, lysine is necessary also. To formally test this less likely possibility would require a mutant IκB-α bearing substitutions of all lysines other than 21 and 22.Individual ubiquitination sites do not usually play a dominant role in protein degradation, where often multiple functional ubiquitination sites exist and targeted mutations have little effect(30.Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar), although the degradation of Mos may be another exception to this rule(44.Nishizawa M. Furuno N. Okazaki K. Tanaka H. Ogawa Y. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4021-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is possible that ubiquitination of IκB-α may be specifically directed to lysines 21 and 22, or, alternatively, that these lysines are the only ones accessible for ligation (no other lysines exist NH2-terminal to the phosphorylation sites). This latter possibility may be supported by the observation that ubiquitination occurs with IκB-α still bound to NF-κB(29.Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar), which should partially shield the inhibitor. The central part of IκB-α consists of 6 ankyrin repeats whose primary function is to interact with NF-κB; this part may be largely buried in the cleft between the two NF-κB subunits, as suggested by x-ray crystallographic data of p50 homodimers(45.Muller C.W. Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 46.Ghosh G. Van Duyne S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The fairly short COOH-terminal region of IκB-α is required for inhibition of DNA binding by NF-κB, implying that it too may interact with NF-κB proteins(25.Brown K. Gertsberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 43.Ernst M.K. Dunn L.L. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 872-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the NH2-terminal part of the protein is not required for these functions, rather, it must be accessible to a kinase(s) to allow inducible phosphorylation. An as yet undetermined protein may then recognize the phosphorylated protein, presumably by recognizing the phosphorylated serines or local changes induced in the protein as a consequence of phosphorylation (no major conformational changes are expected, since the phosphorylated species remains tightly bound to NF-κB and continues to inhibit)(18.Finco T.S.

It remains to be shown whether highly ubiquitinated IκB-α is removed from the complex just prior to degradation, or if degradation is initiated"

Despite the recognized overlap in the regulatory mechanisms involved in mediator production, little information exists regarding receptor-initiated signaling pathways that coordinately control multiple end points, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and nitric oxide production. In this study, the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in macrophages is shown to be regulated by calcium and by a purinoreceptor signaling system.

Macrophages are known to express P1 purinoreceptors (which preferentially bind AMP and adenosine but not ATP or ADP) as well as several members of the P2 purinoreceptors, namely those from the P2U, P2Y, and P2Z subclasses(17.Dubyak G.R.

We demonstrate here that the LPS-stimulable GTPase in RAW 264.7 macrophage membranes is controlled by P2Y purinoreceptor agonists. Earlier studies have shown that this receptor class can mobilize calcium(19.Greenberg S. Di Vergilio F. Steinberg T.H. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10337-10343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an important intracellular second messenger. Because nitric oxide is an important inflammatory mediator and because extracellular adenine nucleotides (e.g. 2-MeS-ATP) affect macrophage activation, we have examined the actions of P2 purinoreceptors and calcium on macrophage iNOS expression. We report that calcium can promote LPS-stimulated nitric oxide production and that adenine nucleotides (2-MeS-ATP) can inhibit LPS-induced NO generation by preventing accumulation of iNOS mRNA; these observations represent two previously unidentified pathways regulating iNOS expression. RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 using RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mML-glutamine, 2 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B.

RAW 264.7 cells were plated on 1-cm2 glass coverslips, allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37°C in 80 μl of supplemented RPMI 1640, and the coverslips were then incubated overnight in 24-well plates containing an additional 1 ml of medium. Loading of the cells with the fluorescent calcium indicator dye Fura-2AM was initiated by replacing the medium with 1 ml of supplemented RPMI 1640 containing 1 μM Fura-2AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), 0.02% plurionic detergent (Molecular Probes), and 0.5 mM sulfinpyrazone to prevent dye efflux(21.Steinberg T.H.

After 20 min of incubation at 37°C, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of supplemented RPMI 1640 containing only 0.5 mM sulfinpyrazone for an additional 20-min incubation. The coverslips were then washed and placed in a cuvette containing 900 μl of a saline solution containing 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 1 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM glucose, 10 mM NaHCO3, 20 mM HEPES, and 0.5 mM sulfinpyrazone at 25°C and pH 7.4. Fura-2 fluorescence was monitored with continuous stirring for 10 min in a Hitachi model F2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer using excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and collecting at the emission wavelength of 510 nm. Each measurement was initiated by the addition of 100 μl of saline containing various nucleotides resulting in the indicated final concentrations. NO production was measured by assessing the nitrite content of 100 μl of tissue culture supernatant using the Griess reagent and reading the absorbance at 550 nm(22.Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Misko T.P. McDaniel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C48-C54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Murad F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 615-624PubMed Google Scholar). PEC (4 × 106 cells/2.5 ml of medium) were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml, IFN-γ (150 units/ml)) and 2-MeS-ATP for 6 h. Total RNA was isolated and probed for cyclophilin and mouse macrophage iNOS by Northern blot analysis. A cDNA probe for murine iNOS (bases 1-2,223) was prepared by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction as described previously(22.Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Misko T.P. McDaniel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C48-C54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PEC were incubated for 5 h in methionine-deficient medium in the presence of LPS (1 μg/ml), IFN-γ (150 units/ml), and 2-MeS-ATP. [35S]Methionine (300 μCi) was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 13 h. The cells were harvested, and iNOS was immunoprecipitated using rabbit antiserum specific for mouse macrophage iNOS. This antiserum was prepared against a C-terminal 27 amino acid peptide from iNOS as described previously(22.Corbett J.A. Kwon G. Misko T.P. McDaniel M.L. Am. J.

Western analysis of unlabeled cells was performed using a 1:2,000 dilution of the primary anti-iNOS antibody and ECL reagents (Amersham Corp.) for detection.

J. 1991; 277: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Further characterization of this GTPase shows that its regulation is controlled by a P2Y-like purinoreceptor. As shown in Table 1, LPS preparations stimulate the macrophage GTPase in the presence of ATP or ADP. In contrast, UTP and 2′- and 3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate (Bz-ATP) at several concentrations are unable to stimulate basal GTPase activity or synergize with LPS (Table 1 and data not shown). These compounds are ligands for the P2U and P2Z receptor classes, respectively; therefore these results argue against P2U and P2Z receptor involvement. The role of P1 purinoreceptors is also excluded, because adenosine (1-1,000 μM), in the presence or absence of LPS did not stimulate membrane GTPase activity. However, the P2Y receptor partial agonist 2-MeS-ATP dose-dependently blocked the responses to LPS in the presence of ATP or ADP (Table 1, (12.Proctor R.A. Denlinger L.C. Leventhal P.S. Daugherty S.K. van de Loo J.-W. Tanke T. Firestein G.S. Bertics P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6017-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and data not shown). In sum, these results suggest that the LPS-stimulated GTPase activity in RAW 264.7 membranes is influenced by P2Y-like purinoreceptors.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Ligand-occupied P2Y and other purinoreceptors can modulate G-protein-dependent calcium mobilization(17.Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because ADP most potently stimulated the LPS-responsive GTPase in RAW 264.7 cell membranes and has little activity on P2U and P2Z purinoreceptors, we used this agonist to assess P2Y-like purinoreceptor-induced calcium mobilization in Fura-2-loaded RAW 264.7 macrophages. Indeed, the ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence excited at 340 and 380 nm increased from a basal level of 2.230 ± 0.022 to 2.970 ± 0.160 after RAW cell treatment with 100 μM ADP, a result indicative of increased levels of free calcium due to ADP stimulation of these cells. Of note, previous studies have shown that increased calcium levels can influence various LPS-mediated signal transduction events in this and other systems, including the stimulation of a GTPase in RAW 264.7 membranes, 2L. C. Denlinger, K. A. Garis, P. L. Fisette, R. A. Proctor, and P. J. Bertics, manuscript in preparation. the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and the translocation of NF-κB (24.Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 25.Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that calcium fluxes are part of the mechanism by which purinoreceptors regulate the production of inflammatory mediators (e.g. TNF-α, IL-1α, NO). Therefore, the role of calcium on LPS- and/or adenine nucleotide-sensitive end points was assessed, including its effect on NO production. RAW 264.7 cells do not appear to contain a calcium-dependent isoform of NO synthase (Fig. 1 and data not shown); however, the role of calcium in LPS-stimulated expression of iNOS has not been directly investigated. This is particularly relevant because LPS is known to contain large levels of Ca2+ and has been reported to mobilize Ca2+ in macrophages(26.Coughlin R.T. Tonsager S. McGroarty E.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2002-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27.Letari O. Nicosia S. Chiavaroli C. Vacher P. Schlegel W. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 980-983PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the relationship between calcium and LPS or IFN-γ stimulation of nitric oxide production, initial experiments were performed showing that a 20-h coincubation of RAW cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 (0.1-10 μM) and LPS had no effect on the stimulation of nitrite production induced by LPS treatment alone. However, when primed with A23187 for 4 h followed by a brief LPS exposure (15 min), RAW 264.7 cells produce 4-fold higher levels of nitrite 20 h later, relative to that seen in untreated cells (Fig. 1). Unprimed RAW cells stimulated with LPS did not produce nitrite nor did macrophages treated with ionophore alone (Fig. 1). Furthermore, RAW cells treated first with LPS for 15 min followed by 4 h of ionophore exposure also did not produce nitrite (data not shown). These observations are consistent with data showing that simultaneous treatment of RAW cells with LPS and 5 mM EGTA or 30 μM La3+, respectively, produced 70 and 95% inhibition of the amount nitrite measured 18 h later. Similar studies by others show that either simultaneous treatment with LPS and Cd3+ or pretreatment with dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blockers followed by LPS stimulation of macrophages can inhibit LPS-induced nitrite production by these cells(23.Schmidt H.H.H.W. Warner T.D. Nakane M. Forstermann U. Murad F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 615-624PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Szabo C. Thiemermann C. Vane J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 825-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We also examined the role of calcium in IFN-γ plus LPS-induced nitrite formation by RAW cells using the same experimental design (Fig. 1). Although 15 min of stimulation with LPS plus IFN-γ is sufficient to induce the production of nitrite by RAW cells, the level of nitrite produced is enhanced 2-fold when the cells are primed with A23187. As is the case for LPS induction, ionophore treatment after the LPS plus IFN-γ stimulus does not produce additional nitrite (data not shown). Following pretreatment with a different calcium ionophore, ionomycin (1 μM), we also observed a 2-fold enhancement of the amount of nitrite produced from LPS plus IFN-γ-stimulated RAW cells relative to similar controls. Ionophore (A23187) pretreatment followed by an IFN-γ stimulation for 15 min does not induce nitrite formation by RAW cells indicating that ionophore pretreatment cannot mimic the effects of LPS on iNOS expression (Fig. 1). Together, these experiments and the data in Fig. 1 demonstrate a calcium-dependent phase of nitrite production by RAW cells. Additionally, we have observed a lack of stimulation of nitrite production by ionophore alone (Fig. 1), a 9-h lag in ionophore-enhanced nitrite formation after LPS stimulation (data not shown), and the ability of cycloheximide (2.5 μg/ml) to exert >95% inhibition of ionophore-pretreated, LPS-induced nitrite generation. These results implicate a calcium-sensitive factor as an important regulatory molecule for the expression of iNOS by RAW cells. To assess whether LPS-induced nitric oxide production is regulated by purinoreceptors, we performed initial experiments with RAW cells looking at the ability of adenine nucleotides to stimulate nitrite production in the presence and absence of LPS. These experiments revealed that various adenine nucleotides synergize with low levels of LPS to generate nitrite. These data have now been confirmed by Tonetti et al.(29.Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bistolfi T. Benatti U. De Flora A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and even though UTP was shown to weakly synergize with LPS in terms of nitrite production, their findings extend this observation to suggest that the P2Y purinoreceptor class on RAW cells is likely to be responsible for this effect. In the present study, we demonstrate that the P2Y purinoreceptor partial agonist 2-MeS-ATP also influences LPS-stimulated nitrite production in RAW cells and in primary mouse macrophages. As shown in Fig. 2A, concentrations of 2-MeS-ATP of 100 μM and above inhibit LPS-induced nitrite formation in RAW cells by 60% at 0.1 μg of LPS/ml. At higher concentrations of LPS, 2-MeS-ATP was less effective at inhibiting RAW cell production of nitrite. However, in mouse peritoneal macrophages, 2-MeS-ATP inhibits LPS plus IFN-γ-induced nitrite and total nitric oxide production (nitrite plus nitrate) in a concentration-dependent fashion, i.e. inhibition was detectable at 100 μM, and complete inhibition was observed at a concentration of 1 mM 2-MeS-ATP (Fig. 2B). In comparison with the transformed RAW 264.7 cells, the observation that primary macrophages are more responsive to 2-MeS-ATP inhibition of LPS-induced nitric oxide production is consistent with our in vitro and in vivo studies examining the antagonistic effects of 2-MeS-ATP on LPS-stimulated TNF-α production(11.Bertics P.J. van de Loo J.-W. Denlinger L. Leventhal P.S. Tomachek J. Tanke T. Daugherty S. Golenbock D.T. Proctor R.A. Levin J. Alving C.R. Munford R.S. Stutz P.L. Bacterial Endotoxins: Recognition and Effector Mechanisms.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6017-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of 2-MeS-ATP on nitric oxide production by primary macrophages appears to be specific for LPS signaling events, as 2-MeS-ATP does not inhibit nitrite formation induced by treatment of macrophages with TNF-α and IFN-γ (Fig. 2C). The fact that nitrite production by TNF-α requires IFN-γ and is not affected by IL-1 (data not shown), together with the observation that 2-MeS-ATP inhibits LPS plus IFN-γ-stimulated but not TNF-α plus IFN-γ-induced nitrite generation, suggest that LPS stimulates nitrite production independently of TNF-α and IL-1 generation. Additionally, in a system unrelated to nitric oxide production, 2-MeS-ATP treatment does not affect LPS-induced procoagulant activity in macrophages, 3B. S. Schwartz (University of Wisconsin), personal communication. suggesting that the inhibitory effects of this adenine nucleotide on LPS-stimulated TNF-α, IL-1, and nitric oxide production are not via a cytotoxic mechanism. 2-MeS-ATP appears to inhibit nitric oxide production by primary mouse macrophages at the level of iNOS gene expression. As shown in Fig. 3A, 2-MeS-ATP does not significantly inhibit the enzymatic activity of iNOS, examined by incubating LPS plus IFN-γ-pretreated primary macrophages for 3 h with this adenine nucleotide. In contrast, an iNOS enzymatic inhibitor, aminoguanidine(30.Misko T.P. Moore W.M. Kasten T.P. Nickols G.A. Corbett J.A. Tilton R.G. McDaniel M.L. Williamson Jr., J.R. Currie M.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 233: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), inhibits nitrite formation in this whole cell assay system. Fig. 3, B and C, demonstrates that 2-MeS-ATP attenuates LPS plus IFN-γ-stimulated induction of iNOS protein and mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner, similar to its effects on nitric oxide production. 2-MeS-ATP also attenuates macrophage expression of iNOS induced by intraperitoneal injections of LPS into CD-1 mice (Fig. 3D). LPS induction in vivo causes a 2.5-fold increase in the amount of nitrite found ex vivo relative to the unstimulated control. 2-MeS-ATP treatment in vivo causes a 50% reduction of nitrite levels and iNOS protein associated with these primary mouse macrophages (Fig. 3D, inset). The inhibition of nitrite production by aminoguanidine treatment of the induced macrophages in vitro shows that nitrite production occurs during the ex vivo incubation. These data indicate that 2-MeS-ATP is also effective at inhibiting the expression of iNOS induced by LPS under in vivo conditions. To address whether calcium mobilization is part of the mechanism by which purinoreceptors regulate LPS-induced inflammatory mediator production, 2-MeS-ATP was evaluated for its ability to affect calcium-sensitive Fura-2 fluorescence in RAW cells treated with and without ADP (Fig. 4). Consistent with its well characterized partial agonist activities in other systems(31.O'Connor S.E. Dainty I.A. Leff P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 137-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), 2-MeS-ATP treatment alone mediated a smaller increase in free calcium levels than did ADP alone, as assessed by the ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence excited at 340 and 380 nm. However, under these conditions, 2-MeS-ATP was unable to block the increase in free calcium levels stimulated by ADP treatment of RAW 264.7 cells; rather, the effect appears to be additive (Fig. 4). These results suggest several possibilities. For example, the inhibitory effects of 2-MeS-ATP on inflammatory mediator production may be through another P2Y-like or other purinoreceptor class that signals via a mechanism independent of calcium. In this case, ADP stimulation of P2Y-purinoreceptors could cause calcium level increases that enhance iNOS expression. The occupation of another purinoreceptor class by 2-MeS-ATP could then generate a calcium-independent signal that overrides calcium-dependent effects initiated by ADP-bound P2Y purinoreceptors. In addition, the additive increase in free calcium by the combination of ADP and 2-MeS-ATP may be cytostatic or cytotoxic to macrophages. However, several observations argue against this possibility, including the enhancement of LPS-induced RAW cell nitric oxide production by calcium ionophore pretreatment, the lack of inhibition by 2-MeS-ATP of LPS-stimulated procoagulant activity in RAW cells2 and TNF-α plus IFN-γ generated nitrite in peritoneal macrophages, and trypan blue exclusion studies which indicate that cell viability is unaffected by 2-MeS-ATP. Alternatively, the additive increase in free calcium levels due to ADP and 2-MeS-ATP treatments could be selectively antagonistic to the LPS-stimulated pathway, but the experiments with ionophore pretreatment of RAW cells suggest this is not likely, since the large calcium flux expected with this treatment was not inhibitory to LPS-induced nitrite production. This study demonstrates that 2-MeS-ATP inhibits LPS-induced iNOS gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Previous findings have shown that this nucleotide can dramatically reduce serum levels of TNF-α and IL-1α in LPS-challenged mice, without affecting LPS-induced IL-6 serum levels in these mice or procoagulant activity in LPS-stimulated macrophages. The prevention of endotoxic death suggests that 2-MeS-ATP has an important immunomodulatory effect on the inflammatory process(12.Proctor R.A. Denlinger L.C. Leventhal P.S. Daugherty S.K. van de Loo J.-W. Tanke T. Firestein G.S. Bertics P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6017-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our results, in combination with observations that other adenine nucleotides can enhance LPS-stimulated nitrite formation in RAW 264.7 cells (29.Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bistolfi T. Benatti U. De Flora A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and LPS-induced IL-1 production in mice(14.Griffiths R.J. Stam E.J. Downs J.T. Otterness I.G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2821-2828PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that macrophage purinoreceptors control a signal transduction pathway that intersects with LPS signaling. Because this study demonstrates that calcium is important for iNOS expression, one pathway that can be suggested is that ligand occupation of G-protein-coupled purinoreceptors results in calcium mobilization, ultimately modulating LPS-stimulated iNOS expression by affecting one of the multiple calcium-dependent factors that can be involved in initiating iNOS transcription. 2-MeS-ATP in this model may serve to bind, but not activate, a P2Y-like purinoreceptor, thereby blocking stimulation of this receptor class by ATP or ADP, but not preventing the ability of ATP or ADP to signal through other receptor classes. As noted above, the role of calcium in the inhibitory mechanism of 2-MeS-ATP action remains to be more fully characterized; however, a role for calcium in iNOS synthesis, and possibly in TNF-α and IL-1 expression(11.Bertics P.J. van de Loo J.-W. Denlinger L. Leventhal P.S. Tomachek J. Tanke T. Daugherty S. Golenbock D.T. Proctor R.A. Levin J. Alving C.R. Munford R.S. Stutz P.L. Bacterial Endotoxins: Recognition and Effector Mechanisms.

A. 1994; 91: 6017-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), is suggested by these data and observations by others showing that calcium channel blockers can prevent sepsis in rats (32.Lee H.-C. Lum B.K. Circ. Shock. 1986; 18: 193-203PubMed Google Scholar). Because multiple receptor-mediated pathways mobilize calcium in macrophages (e.g. complement, Fcγ, and platelet-activating factor receptors, all of which are stimulated during sepsis(1.Casey L.C. Balk R.A. Bone R.C. Ann. Intern. Med. 1993; 119: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 18.Denlinger L.C. Fisette P.L. Garis K.A. Daugherty S.K. Bertics P.J. Proctor R.A. Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Novel Therapeutic Strategies in the Treatment of Sepsis. Marcel-Decker, Inc., New York1995: 227-252Google Scholar)), the enhancement of mediator expression via elevated calcium is a mechanism that is not exclusive to purinoreceptors. However, purinoreceptors play an important role in the inflammatory response (18.Denlinger L.C. Fisette P.L. Garis K.A. Daugherty S.K. Bertics P.J. Proctor R.A. Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Novel Therapeutic Strategies in the Treatment of Sepsis. Marcel-Decker, Inc., New York1995: 227-252Google Scholar). During infection and/or stress, large levels of extracellular ATP and ADP are released locally from cellular damage and from platelet activation, as well as systemically from the adrenal gland(18.Denlinger L.C. Fisette P.L. Garis K.A. Daugherty S.K. Bertics P.J. Proctor R.A. Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Novel Therapeutic Strategies in the Treatment of Sepsis.

Additionally, many cell types have been shown to release ATP through cell surface proteins containing an ATP binding cassette motif, resulting in autocrine stimulation of purinoreceptors(17.Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Al-Awqati Q. Science. 1995; 269: 805-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that LPS may cause ATP release from stimulated macrophages which could then activate purinoreceptors. Regardless of the source of adenine nucleotides, the stimulation of macrophages by ATP, ADP, or other adenine nucleotides present at the inflammatory site and the functional inhibition by 2-MeS-ATP with respect to LPS-induced TNF-α, IL-1, and nitric oxide production strongly indicate that purinoreceptors can control signal transduction pathways that are critically important to macrophage activation.

In comparison, the metabolic route leading to the formation of UDP-GlcNAc has been poorly investigated. Considering that it was a potential site for the regulation of the flow of metabolites going through the peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide pathways, the latter reaction sequence has recently been investigated in more detail (11.Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6150-6157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5788-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Four successive steps are required for the synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc from fructose 6-phosphate (13.Dobrogosz W.J. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 578-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.White R.J. Biochem. J. 1968; 106: 847-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The first of these reactions is catalyzed by the L-glutamine:D-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (also named glucosamine-6-P synthase)(15.Dutka-Malen S. Mazodier P. Badet B. Biochimie (Paris). 1988; 70: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mutants altered in this activity are characterized by an auxotrophy for GlcN or GlcNAc(16.Sarvas M. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 467-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Wu H.C. Wu T.C. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 455-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the corresponding glmS gene has been located at 84 min on the E. coli map(15.Dutka-Malen S. Mazodier P. Badet B.

J. 1984; 224: 799-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The subsequent steps from GlcN-6-P to UDP-GlcNAc are via GlcN-1-P (Fig. 1). We have previously shown that the gene of unknown function preceding glmS on the E. coli chromosome codes in fact for the GlcNAc-1-P uridyltransferase, and the gene for this final step leading to UDP-GlcNAc (Fig. 1) was named glmU(11.Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6150-6157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, we demonstrated that the glmU gene product also catalyzes the preceding step of acetylation of GlcN-1-P and thus appears as a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing two subsequent steps in the same pathway (12.Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J.

Here we describe the partial purification and some properties of the phosphoglucosamine mutase which catalyzes the interconversion of GlcN-6-P and GlcN-1-P isomers, as well as the identification of the corresponding glmM gene on the chromosome of E. coli.

E. coli strain JM83 (ara Δ [lac-proAB] rpsL thi ϕ 80 dlacZ Δ M15) (19.Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11398) Google Scholar) was used as the host strain for plasmids and for the purification of the glmM gene product. Strain W1485 pgmΔ::tet and plasmid pML14 carrying the E. coli pgm (phosphoglucomutase) gene (20.Lu M. Kleckner N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5847-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by S. Slater. pJP900, a pUC9-derived plasmid carrying the 2.4-kb XhoII fragment of bacteriophage γ with the pR promoter inserted into its BamHI site, was obtained from J. Plá (CSIC, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain). Cloning vector pUC18 and the Kanr cartridge originating from the pUC4K plasmid were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Plasmid pMAK705 bearing a thermosensitive replicon was obtained from S. R. Kushner(21.Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, 2YT was used as a rich medium for growing cells(22.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Growth was monitored at 600 nm with a spectrophotometer (model 240, Gilford Instrument Laboratories, Inc., Oberlin, Ohio). For strains carrying drug resistance genes, antibiotics were used at the following concentrations (in μg•ml-1): ampicillin (100), kanamycin (30), and chloramphenicol (25). Small- and large-scale plasmid isolations were carried out by the alkaline lysis method(23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Standard procedures for endonuclease digestions, ligation, filling-in of 5′-protruding ends by using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and agarose electrophoresis were used(23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 24.Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). E. coli cells were made competent for transformation with plasmid DNA by the method of Dagert and Ehrlich(25.Dagert M. Ehrlich S.D. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 6: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The 17-kb chromosomal fragment from E. coli which is carried by phage 14F11 (clone 521) from the bank of Kohara et al.(26.Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) was used as the starting material for the construction of the different plasmids described in Fig. 2. The pMLD90 plasmid was constructed by inserting the 3.1-kb BamHI fragment carrying the glmM gene (yhbF) into the BamHI site of the pUC18 vector (with glmM in the opposite orientation as compared to the lac promoter from the vector). The pMLD96 plasmid was constructed by inserting the 2.1-kb PstI fragment from pMLD90 into the corresponding site of the pUC18 vector (with glmM and lac promoter in the same orientation). An internal AccI-ClaI deletion in pMLD96 produced the plasmid pMLD99 (Fig. 2). For the expression of glmM under the control of the γ pR promoter, plasmid pMLD100 was constructed by inserting the 2.4-kb XhoII γ fragment (carrying the structural gene cI857 encoding a thermosensitive form of the γ cI repressor, the strong pR promoter, and the ribosome-binding site of cro) (27.Leplatois P. Danchin A. Biochimie (Paris). 1983; 65: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) into the unique BamHI site of pMLD99. The disruption of the glmM gene was obtained by inserting the 1.28-kb HincII kan cartridge originating from pUC4K into the unique BstEII site of plasmid pMLD90 lying within the glmM gene coding sequence, generating plasmid pMLD94 (Fig. 2). The pGMMkan plasmid was constructed by inserting the 4.5-kb BamHI fragment from pMLD94 (harboring the disrupted glmM gene) into the BamHI site of pMAK705(21.Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pGMM plasmid was isolated as described below during the excision process that followed integration of the pGMMkan plasmid at the chromosomal glmM locus. The wild-type chromosomal copy of glmM was replaced by a disrupted one by following the procedure of Hamilton et al.(21.Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which uses pMAK705, a plasmid bearing a thermosensitive replicon. pGMMkan, a pMAK705 derivative carrying the disrupted glmM gene, was transformed into JM83. Integration of the plasmid into the chromosome was selected for by plating cells at 44°C on 2YT-chloramphenicol. Several clones were picked up, and the integration of pGMMkan at the glmM locus was verified by Southern analysis. Excision of the plasmid from the chromosome was then achieved as follows. Cointegrants were grown at 30°C in 2YT-chloramphenicol for at least 30 doubling times and subsequently plated at 30°C. Individual clones were then screened for sensitivity to chloramphenicol at 44°C, which is indicative of plasmid excision. The structures of the excised plasmids from several clones were determined by DNA restriction analysis. One clone containing a plasmid bearing the wild-type glmM gene (called pGMM) was chosen. Finally, the replacement in that strain (named GPM83) of the chromosomal glmM copy by the inactivated one was verified by Southern analysis (data not shown). Cells of GPM83 (1-liter cultures) were grown exponentially at 30°C in 2YT medium. At a cell density of 5 × 104•ml-1, the temperature of the culture was either maintained at 30°C or increased to 43°C. Incubation was continued until the optical density of the culture at 43°C reached a plateau value of 0.5-0.7 about 5 to 6 h later. At this time, cells were rapidly chilled to 0°C and harvested in the cold. Control cultures were made with strain JM83 which carries an intact chromosomal copy of glmM. The extraction of peptidoglycan nucleotide precursors as well as the analytical procedure used for their quantitation were as described previously(6.Mengin-Lecreulx D. Flouret B. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Mengin-Lecreulx D. Flouret B. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1284-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exponential-phase cells of JM83 and GPM83 were grown at 30°C or first at 30°C and then 43°C as described above. Harvested cells were washed with a cold 0.85% NaCl solution and centrifuged again. Bacteria were then rapidly suspended by vigorous stirring in 40 ml of a hot (95 to 100°C) aqueous 4% SDS solution for 30 min. After standing overnight at room temperature, the suspensions were centrifuged for 30 min at 200,000 × g, and the pellets were washed several times with water. Final suspensions made in 5 ml of water were homogenized by brief sonication. Aliquots were hydrolyzed and analyzed as described previously, and the peptidoglycan content of the sacculi was expressed in terms of its DAP content(6.Mengin-Lecreulx D. Flouret B. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 208-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells of JM83 harboring the different plasmids described above (excepting pMLD100) were grown exponentially at 37°C in 2YT-ampicillin medium (1-liter cultures). Cells were harvested in the cold when the optical density of the cultures reached 0.7. A different protocol was used with strain JM83(pMLD100): cells were grown first at 30°C and at an absorbance of 0.01 (5 × 106 cells•ml-1), cultures were shifted to 42°C for 3 h during which time the absorbance reached a value of 0.7. Strains JM83 and GPM83 were grown at 30°C or 43°C as described above for the extraction of peptidoglycan precursors. In all cases, harvested cells were washed with 40 ml of cold 0.02 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The wet cell pellet was suspended in 9 ml of the same buffer and disrupted by sonication (Sonicator 150; T. S. Ultrasons, Annemasse, France) for 10 min with cooling. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 4°C for 30 min at 200,000 × g. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 100 volumes of the same phosphate buffer, and the resulting solution (10 ml, 10 to 12 mg of protein•ml-1) designated as crude enzyme was stored at −20°C. SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins was performed as described previously using 13% polyacrylamide gels(29.Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry, using bovine serum albumin as standard(30.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A coupled assay was routinely used in which the GlcN-1-P synthesized from GlcN-6-P by the mutase was quantitatively converted to UDP-GlcNAc in the presence of purified bifunctional GlmU enzyme(12.Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5788-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The standard assay mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM GlcN-6-P, 0.4 mM [14C]acetyl-CoA (700 Bq), 10 mM UTP, 0.7 mM Glc-1,6-diP, pure GlmU enzyme (1 μg), and enzyme (0.1 to 10 μg of protein, depending on overexpression or purification factors) in a final volume of 100 μl. Mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 30 min, and reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of acetic acid. Reaction products were separated by high-voltage electrophoresis on Whatman No. 3MM filter paper in 2% formic acid (pH 1.9) for 90 min at 40 V/cm using an LT36 apparatus (Savant Instruments, Hicksville, NY). The only two radioactive spots (acetyl-CoA and UDP-GlcNAc) were located by overnight autoradiography using type R2 films (3 M, St. Paul, MN) or with a radioactivity scanner (model Multi-Tracermaster LB285, Berthold France, Elancourt, France). They were cut out and counted in an Intertechnique SL 30 liquid scintillation spectrophotometer with a solvent system consisting of 2 ml of water and 13 ml of Aqualyte mixture (J. T. Baker Chemicals, Deventer, Netherlands). 1 unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount which catalyzed the synthesis of 1 μmol of GlcN-1-P in 1 min. A large culture (3 × 18 liters) of strain JM83 was performed at 37°C in a fermenter. Cells were harvested at the end of the exponential phase and disrupted by sonication as described above. The resulting soluble protein extract (5 g of protein, 240 units of phosphoglucosamine mutase activity, 198 ml) was loaded onto a column (5 × 25 cm) of DEAE-Trisacryl-M (BioSepra, Villeneuve-la-Garenne, France) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% (v/v) glycerol). The elution was run at a flow rate of 2 ml•min-1, first with 120 ml of buffer A, and then with a linear gradient (1 liter) of NaCl (0 to 160 mM) in buffer A. Fractions (12 ml) were collected and assayed for phosphoglucosamine mutase activity. The most active fractions which eluted in 70 mM NaCl were pooled (96 units, 420 mg of protein) and concentrated to 30 ml by ultrafiltration through PM10 membranes (Amicon). The buffer was exchanged with buffer B (5 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing the same additives as buffer A) by repeated concentration and dilution using PM10 membranes. The protein solution was loaded onto a column (5 × 17 cm) of hydroxylapatite-Ultrogel (BioSepra) pre-equilibrated with buffer B. The elution was run at a flow rate of 2 ml•min-1, first with 150 ml of buffer B, and then with a linear gradient (800 ml) of potassium phosphate (5 mM to 200 mM). 10-ml fractions were collected and assayed for phosphoglucosamine mutase activity. The most active fractions which eluted in 150 mM potassium phosphate were pooled (50 units, 41 mg of protein) and concentrated as above to about 5 ml. This solution was loaded onto a column (1 × 50 cm) of Ultrogel-AcA 44 (BioSepra) equilibrated with buffer C (as buffer A but 100 mM in potassium phosphate), and the elution was run at a flow rate of 0.1 ml•min-1. Active fractions (48 units, 32 mg of protein) were pooled, concentrated as above to 5 ml, and dialyzed against buffer A. This solution was loaded onto a column (2.5 × 13 cm) of carboxymethyl-cellulose CM32 equilibrated with buffer D (buffer A at pH 6.15). The elution was run at a flow rate of 1 ml•min-1, first with 60 ml buffer D, and then with a linear gradient (400 ml) of NaCl (0 to 200 mM) in buffer D. Under these conditions, the phosphoglucosamine mutase eluted in 10 mM NaCl, slightly later than the remaining contaminant proteins. Most active fractions were pooled (20 units, 7.7 mg of protein) and dialyzed against buffer A. Quantitative amino acid analyses were performed with an analyzer (model LC 2000; Biotronik, Frankfurt, FRG) after hydrolysis of samples in 6 M HCl at 95°C for 16 h. For NH2-terminal amino acid analysis, 25 μg of partially purified phosphoglucosamine mutase was resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was stained with Ponceau Red, and the major protein band (corresponding to the enzyme) was excised. Microsequencing was performed with a model 473A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) under standard conditions involving the detection of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives. [14C]acetyl-CoA (1.85 GBq•mmol-1) was purchased from ICN. GlcN-1-P, GlcN-6-P, Glc-1,6-diP, UTP, and UDP-GlcNAc were from Sigma. Starting from a 54-liter culture of wild-type strain JM83 which yielded 5 g of total soluble proteins, the phosphoglucosamine mutase activity was purified approximately 150-fold to a final specific activity of 7.2 μmol•min-1•mg-1 (Table 1). The purest fractions eluted from the last column contained a major protein species migrating after denaturating polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a protein of 45-50 kDa (Fig. 3). It was the only one coeluting perfectly in all purification steps with the phosphoglucosamine mutase activity. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this protein species was thus determined after electroblotting on Immobilon-P and appeared as follows: SNRKYFGTXXI.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The alignment of this sequence with those of proteins from the Swissprot and Genpro libraries revealed that it matched perfectly with the N-terminal sequence MSNRKYFGTDGI predicted for the product of an E. coli open reading frame of unknown function named yhbF(31.Dallas W.S. Dev I.K. Ray P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7743-7744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or mrsA (GenBank accession number U01376) which was located near folP at 69.5 min on the chromosome. Several discrepancies were observed when comparing the two reported sequences of this gene. Using plasmid pMLD96 (Fig. 2) as the template and appropriate synthetic oligonucleotides, the complete 1335-bp coding sequence was thus verified again and appeared similar to that published first (yhbF). Taking into account the post-translational removal of the N-terminal methionine (revealed by protein sequencing), the mature product of this gene is theoretically a 444-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 47,380. In fact, this gene was identified at the same time by searching in data bases for a protein exhibiting sequence similarities with other known hexosephosphate mutases. The sequence of the phosphomannomutase from E. coli (the cpsG gene product) was used in the search which yielded all phosphoglucomutase and phosphomannomutase sequences characterized to date, as well as the YhbF putative peptide (26% identity in 433 overlaps). The alignment of YhbF with the same libraries gave as best scores two other proteins of unknown function containing 445 and 463 amino acids, respectively: UreC from Helicobacter pylori (44.1% identity on 425 residues) (32.Labigne A. Cussac V. Courcoux P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1920-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and a putative protein from Mycobacterium leprae (Genpro accession number U00020.PE23, 44% identity on 440 residues). All these sequences contain in particular a short region previously characterized as the putative active site of hexosephosphate mutases. This motif which is described as (GA)(LIVM)X (LIVM)(ST)(PGA)S∗HXPX4(GN) in the PROSITE data base (PS00710) appeared as GIVISAS∗HNPFYDNG in YhbF, where S∗ represents the active-site serine residue. It was generally assumed that the serine residue was phosphorylated during the catalytic action of the hexosephosphate mutases, a reaction requiring the presence of the corresponding hexose 1,6-diphosphate(33.Joshi J.G. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2741-2751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.McCoy E.E. Najjar V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 3017-3021Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 35.Ray Jr., W.J. Peck Jr., E.J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 6. Academic Press, New York1972: 407-477Google Scholar). This serine residue was located at position 102 in the sequence of YhbF. All these data clearly showed that the yhbF gene encoded the phosphoglucosamine mutase. The specific activity of phosphoglucosamine mutase in strains overexpressing the yhbF gene was estimated. A significant overproduction (up to 18-fold) in cells carrying plasmids with the yhbF gene expressed under the control of the lac promoter was observed (Table 2). As shown in Fig. 4, this was accompanied by the accumulation in the cell content of a protein species of about 47 kDa, a value in agreement with that (47,380) calculated from the DNA sequence(31.Dallas W.S. Dev I.K. Ray P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7743-7744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A more efficient overproducing plasmid pMLD100 with the yhbF gene expressed under the control of the strong γ pR promoter was constructed. When cells of JM83(pMLD100) were grown exponentially at 30°C and then shifted to 42°C, an initial increase in the growth rate was observed, but growth progressively slowed down and the culture finally reached a plateau value. As soon as 1 h after the temperature shift, a large accumulation of the 47K protein was observed, which further increased to finally account for more than 20-30% of the cell proteins after a 3-h incubation period (Fig. 4). It comigrated with the protein overproduced from the other plasmid construction as well as with the phosphoglucosamine mutase purified from wild-type strain JM83 (Fig. 4). A typical fractionation procedure of cell extracts showed that the highly overproduced protein was mainly found in the soluble fraction, but that significant amounts (10 to 20%) remained associated with the particulate fraction. This finding was certainly due to the formation of aggregates at this high level of protein expression, as confirmed by the presence of multiple inclusion bodies in induced cells when observed by optical microscopy. Finally, we showed that after 3 h of growth at 42°C, JM83(pMLD100) cells contained about 50-fold more phosphoglucosamine mutase activity than cells carrying the pUC18 control vector (Table 2). All these different results taken together supported the initial proposal that the yhbF gene coded for the phosphoglucosamine mutase. This gene was thus named glmM (for glucosamine mutase) following the nomenclature previously adopted for the glmS and glmU genes from the same pathway (11.Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6150-6157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Wu H.C. Wu T.C. J.

Biochem. 1994; 221: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the phosphoglucosamine mutase was assumed to be active only in a phosphorylated form. As explained before, the serine residue at position 102 was the putative phosphorylated site and GlcN-1,6-diP was expected to be the phosphorylating agent. Since the latter compound was not commercially available, we used instead Glc-1,6-diP in our enzymatic assays, as generally was done with hexosephosp"

In this study we have made a series of Gαt/Gαi1 chimeras differing at as few as 11 positions from native Gαt. Ten chimeras are properly folded, contain GDP, can assume an AlF4--induced activated conformation, and interact with βγt and light-activated rhodopsin. They differ dramatically in their affinity for GDP, from Gi-like (initial rates 225 μmol/mol s) to Gt-like (initial rates 4.9 μmol/mol s).We have used these chimeras to define contact sites on Gαt with the effector enzyme cGMP phosphodiesterase. GαtGTP but not GαtGDP activates it by removing the phosphodiesterase (PDE) γ inhibitory subunit. In solution, GαtGTP interacts with PDEγ (Kd 12 nM), while GαtGDP binds PDEγ more weakly (Kd 0.88 μM). The interaction of GαiGDP with PDEγ is undetectable, but GαiGDP-AlF4- interacts weakly with PDEγ (Kd 2.4 μM). Using defined Gαt/Gαi chimeras, we have individuated the regions on Gαt most important for interaction with PDEγ in the basal and activated states.

https://openalex.org/W2083364868,"A major unresolved issue in the field of secretory granule biogenesis is the extent to which the aggregation of granule content proteins is responsible for the sorting of regulated from constitutively secreted proteins. The aggregation process is postulated to take place in the trans-Golgi network and immature secretory granules as the proteins encounter mildly acidic pH and high calcium concentrations. We have developed in vitro assays that reconstitute the precipitation out of solution of secretory granule content proteins of anterior pituitary gland and adrenal medulla. In the assays, all of the major granule content polypeptides form a precipitate as the pH is titrated below 6.5, and this precipitate can be recovered in the pellet fraction after centrifugation. Addition of calcium is required for the aggregation of chromaffin granule content. In contrast to the proteins secreted by the regulated pathway, the constitutively secreted proteins IgG, albumin, and angiotensinogen, when added to the assays, remain predominantly in the supernatant. Among the individual proteins tested, prolactin is found to aggregate homophilically under these conditions and can drive the co-aggregation of other proteins, such as the chromogranins. Soluble forms of granule membrane proteins, including dopamine β-hydroxylase and peptidyl glycine α-amidating enzyme also co-aggregated with granule content proteins. The results are consistent with the idea that spontaneous aggregation of proteins occurring under ionic conditions similar to those at the sites of granule formation is a property restricted to those proteins packaged in secretory granules. In addition, the association of luminal domains of membrane proteins with content proteins in vitro raises the possibility that analogous interactions between membrane-bound and content proteins also occur during granule formation in intact cells. A major unresolved issue in the field of secretory granule biogenesis is the extent to which the aggregation of granule content proteins is responsible for the sorting of regulated from constitutively secreted proteins.

We have developed in vitro assays that reconstitute the precipitation out of solution of secretory granule content proteins of anterior pituitary gland and adrenal medulla. In the assays, all of the major granule content polypeptides form a precipitate as the pH is titrated below 6.5, and this precipitate can be recovered in the pellet fraction after centrifugation. Addition of calcium is required for the aggregation of chromaffin granule content. In contrast to the proteins secreted by the regulated pathway, the constitutively secreted proteins IgG, albumin, and angiotensinogen, when added to the assays, remain predominantly in the supernatant. Among the individual proteins tested, prolactin is found to aggregate homophilically under these conditions and can drive the co-aggregation of other proteins, such as the chromogranins. Soluble forms of granule membrane proteins, including dopamine β-hydroxylase and peptidyl glycine α-amidating enzyme also co-aggregated with granule content proteins. The results are consistent with the idea that spontaneous aggregation of proteins occurring under ionic conditions similar to those at the sites of granule formation is a property restricted to those proteins packaged in secretory granules. In addition, the association of luminal domains of membrane proteins with content proteins in vitro raises the possibility that analogous interactions between membrane-bound and content proteins also occur during granule formation in intact cells."

We have screened a combinatorial peptide library based on the C terminus of the α subunit of Gt(340-350) and have identified unique sequences that bind rhodopsin with high affinity. Six of these sequences, as both fusion proteins and synthetic peptides, were significantly more potent than the parent sequence in binding to and stabilization of metarhodopsin II. These sequences provide information about which residues are required for appropriate receptor interaction. We observed that in all the high affinity sequences, a positively charged residue at position 341 was changed to a neutral one. Thus, it appears that the receptor-G protein interaction was designed to be low affinity to ensure efficient catalysis of G protein activation. We also observed Cys-347 and Gly-348 to be invariant, and hydrophobic residues were always located at positions 340, 344, 349, and 350, demonstrating the critical nature of these residues.

Activated receptors display a high affinity binding site for heterotrimeric G proteins, which, depending on the receptor type, appears to consist of one or more of the cytoplasmic regions of the receptor. Interestingly, however, comparison of the primary sequences of receptors that are known to interact with the same G protein has not revealed the underlying consensus sequence. High affinity interaction of heterotrimeric G proteins with activated receptors requires the presence of both the G protein α and β/γ subunits. Three regions on the α subunit are known to be important for receptor interaction, the N-terminal 23 residues, an internal sequence that includes the TCAT region which contacts the guanine ring, and the C terminus(1.Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hoffman K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The extreme C terminus of G protein α subunits is one of the critical points of contact with activated receptors(1.Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hoffman K.P.

This C-terminal region of G protein α subunits is also important in determining the specificity of receptor-G protein interaction(9.Conklin R.B. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), although other regions of α subunits are also involved(10.Lee C.H. Katz A. Simon M.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 218-223PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides corresponding to the last 11 amino acids of α subunits have been shown to mimic the conformational effect of heterotrimeric G proteins on receptors by stabilizing the active, agonist-bound form of the receptor, although with low potency(1.Hamm H.E.

In this study, we have used a random “peptides-on-plasmids” library approach (14.Cull M.G. Miller J.F. Schatz P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1865-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) to identify potent rhodopsin-binding peptide sequences related to a C-terminal Gtα peptide, Gtα-340-350 (1.Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hoffman K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 7.Dratz E.D. Fursteneau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) from a library of greater than 109 peptides. Using this method, we have developed several high affinity analogues of Gtα-340-350 and have gained insight into the structural requirements for peptide binding and stabilization of the activated conformation of rhodopsin, metarhodopsin II (Meta II). Bacterial strains, plasmids, and library construction are essentially as described(15.Schatz, P. J., Cull, M. G., Martin, E. L., Gates, C. M. (1996) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Escherichia coli ARI 814 (Δ(srl-recA) endA1 nupG lon-11 sulA1 hsdR17 Δ(ompT-fepC) ΔclpA319::kan ΔlacI lacZU118) was used for all experiments. Plasmid pJS142 was used for library construction. A second plasmid, pELM3, a pMal-c2 derivative with a modified polylinker (New England Biolabs), was used for expression of maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins. This isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible vector contains the E. coli malE gene with a deleted leader sequence, leading to cytoplasmic expression of the fusion proteins. An oligonucleotide, ON-2333, was synthesized to encode a mutagenesis library based on the K341R derivative of the native 340-350 C-terminal sequence of Gtα, IKENLKDCGLF (5′-GA GGT GGT NNK NNK NNK NNK att cgt gaa aac tta aaa gat tgt ggt ctg ttc TAA CTA AGT AAA GC). Uppercase letters denote positions synthesized with pure phosphoramidites or with equimolar mixes (N = A, C, G, and T; K = G and T). Lowercase letters denote bases synthesized with 70% of the indicated base and 10% of each of the other bases. This mutagenesis rate leads to approximately a 50% chance that a codon will be mutated to encode another amino acid. Additionally, four random NNK codons were synthesized on the 5′-end of the sequence to make a total of 15 randomized codons. Buffers and general methods are described elsewhere (15.Schatz, P. J., Cull, M. G., Martin, E. L., Gates, C. M. (1996) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). In the dark, EDTA-washed rod outer segment (ROS) membrane fragments (16.Mazzoni M.R. Malinski J.A. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14072-14081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were directly immobilized on Immulon 4 (Dynatech) microtiter wells (1 μg of protein/well) in cold 35 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, buffer containing 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (HEK/DTT). After shaking for 1 h at 4°C, unbound ROS were washed away with cold HEK/DTT. The wells were blocked with 1% BSA in HEK/DTT for 1 h at 4°C. During this incubation the E. coli cells containing the library were lysed in a final volume of 10 ml. After centrifugation, cleared crude lysate was concentrated in a Centriprep 100 concentrator (Amicon). The blocked ROS-coated plate was rinsed briefly in HEK/DTT and exposed to room light for less than 5 min on ice to activate the rhodopsin. Immediately thereafter, the lysate was added to 48 wells for round 1 and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. In the subsequent round, 24 ROS-coated wells were used for panning. Due to the reduction in library diversity only 4 wells were used in rounds 3 and 4. Equal numbers of wells without ROS were also included as a negative control in those panning rounds. Elution and amplification of the selected plasmids were performed as described(15.Schatz, P. J., Cull, M. G., Martin, E. L., Gates, C. M. (1996) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Prior to elution in the third and fourth rounds, 1 mM Gtα-340-350 analog, IRENLKDSGLF, was allowed to compete for 15 min at 4°C to select for higher affinity peptides. In the fourth round of panning, the recovery of plasmids from ROS membrane-coated wells was 430-fold more than that from the same number of control wells. The entire population of peptide-coding sequences from round 4 was transferred from pJS142 into pELM3, and the fusion proteins were expressed for screening in a MBP ELISA(15.Schatz, P. J., Cull, M. G., Martin, E. L., Gates, C. M. (1996) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). All fusion proteins were assayed with and without immobilized EDTA-washed ROS membranes prepared as described(16.Mazzoni M.R. Malinski J.A. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14072-14081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the dark, 1 μg/well ROS membranes were directly immobilized on Immulon 4 (Dynatech) microtiter wells in cold HEK/DTT. After 1-h incubation at 4°C, unbound ROS were washed away with cold HEK/DTT. The wells were blocked with 1% BSA in HEK/DTT for 1 h at 4°C, after which MBP fusion proteins were added for 30 min. Bound MBP fusion proteins were detected by rabbit anti-MBP antibodies. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was used to detect the primary antibody, and the assay was developed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The positive control for the assay was pELM17, which encodes the MBP fusion protein of Gtα-340-350 peptide analog (K341R). pELM6, which expresses a MBP protein fused to a linker only, was used as the negative control. “No lysate” control wells were included to reflect any intrinsic nonspecific binding within the assay. Some of the MBP fusion proteins were further purified on an amylose column (New England Biolabs) and eluted with 10 mM maltose as described by the supplier. The dose response for the ability of each of these MBP fusion proteins to compete with the LacI-Gtα-K341R-340-350 fusion protein for binding to light-activated rhodopsin was measured in an ELISA format(15.Schatz, P. J., Cull, M. G., Martin, E. L., Gates, C. M. (1996) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Microtiter wells were coated with 0.5 μg of ROS/well and blocked with BSA in the dark. Serial dilutions of purified MBP fusion proteins were made in HEK/DTT/BSA buffer. After light activation of the rhodopsin, each dilution was added to duplicate wells and then incubated for 45 min at 4°C. The LacI fusion protein containing Gtα-K341R-340-350 was then added. The incubation was continued for 30 min to allow the competition of the two protein fusions to take place, and the amount of bound LacI was detected by an anti-LacI antibody(15.Schatz, P. J., Cull, M. G., Martin, E. L., Gates, C. M. (1996) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Dose-response curves were generated, and IC50 values were calculated using the computer programs Ligand and Deltagraph Pro 3.5. Stabilization of Meta II was measured in an SLM Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer essentially as described(7.Dratz E.D. Fursteneau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), except that the EDTA-washed rhodopsin (5 μM) was incubated in a 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 8.2, containing 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT. The samples were maintained at 5.3°C by a water-cooled thermal jacketed cuvette holder. The resulting dose-response curves and EC50 values were derived by the non-linear regression program PRISM. Gtα-340-350 analogues were synthesized by the solid-phase Merrifield method using Fmoc(N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems automated peptide synthesizer. Peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a C4 preparative column and an acetonitrile, 6 mM HCl gradient. The purified peptides were subjected to fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and analytical reverse-phase HPLC to determine purity and authenticity. Peptides 18S, 18L, 23S, and 23L were synthesized by SynPep Corporation and were purified and characterized using similar methods. To explore the sequence requirements for binding of the C terminus of Gtα to activated rhodopsin and to search for potent peptide analogues, we constructed a mutagenesis library based on a 15-amino acid sequence consisting of a 4-amino acid linker and 11 amino acids from the C-terminal analog, Gtα-K341R-340-350(7.Dratz E.D. Fursteneau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To construct the library, we used the “peptides-on-plasmids” vector pJS142(14.Cull M.G. Miller J.F. Schatz P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1865-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 15.Schatz, P. J., Cull, M. G., Martin, E. L., Gates, C. M. (1996) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar), which resulted in a library containing approximately 2 × 109 independent recombinants. The library peptides were fused to the C terminus of the DNA binding protein LacI. Each plasmid vector from which the fusion proteins are expressed contains two lacO DNA sequences to which the LacI fusion protein binds with high affinity, leading to the formation of peptide-LacI-plasmid complexes in each transformed cell in the library population. After cell lysis, the library complexes expressing peptides of interest were affinity purified by “panning” on immobilized rhodopsin. Plasmids recovered after each round of panning were amplified for additional rounds of panning after transformation of E. coli(14.Cull M.G. Miller J.F. Schatz P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1865-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 15.Schatz, P. J., Cull, M. G., Martin, E. L., Gates, C. M. (1996) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). To select for the highest affinity peptides in the population, we carried out the last two of the four total rounds of panning in the presence of a Gtα-340-350 peptide analog as a competitor in a wash step to “chase” low affinity complexes off of the immobilized receptor. After the final round, the enriched population of peptide coding sequences was transferred to the vector pELM3 so that they were fused in frame with the E. coli MBP. Peptides fused to MBP can be analyzed in a competition ELISA where the resulting signal is a rough correlate of their affinity for the rhodopsin(15.Schatz, P. J., Cull, M. G., Martin, E. L., Gates, C. M. (1996) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar, 17.Gates C.M. Stemmer W.P.C. Kaptein R. Schatz P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Of 28 individually selected clones, 24 yielded a positive signal in the MBP ELISA (Fig. 1A). The signal intensities from these positive clones are stronger than that of the positive control clone, pELM17, which encodes the Gtα-K341R-340-350 undecamer. DNA sequencing of these MBP ELISA-positive clones yielded 18 unique, readable sequences. The positive sequences are shown (Fig. 2B), as well as the C-terminal 11 amino acids of the known mammalian G protein α-subunits (Fig. 2A) for comparison. Also shown are the rhodopsin-specific binding sequences from the second round of panning, which were presumably lower affinity, on average, than those present after later rounds of panning. The resulting percent identity and similarity (homology) with Gtα for each residue is in Fig. 2C. Interestingly, the four upstream amino acid linkers do not share an obvious consensus sequence.Figure 2:A, comparison of the sequences of the C-terminal 11 amino acids of the known G protein α subunits. Darkly shaded amino acids are those conserved throughout G protein α-subunits, and lightly shaded residues are those which are similar (homologous). B, comparison of the sequences of the peptides identified from the fourth and second rounds of panning of the combinatorial library. Darkly shaded amino acids are those that remain identical to native Gtα, and lightly shaded ones are those that have undergone replacement with similar amino acids. The fourth round was screened using an MBP ELISA and the second round screened using a LacI ELISA. C, percent identity and similarity (homology) of the library-derived sequences from the second and fourth rounds of panning. Based on the method for generating the oligonucleotides, 50% of the time the naturally occurring amino acid will be encoded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sequences derived from the fourth round of panning suggest that 2 of the 11 residues, Cys-347 and Gly-348, are absolutely required for binding to rhodopsin (Fig. 2). These two amino acids are conserved among all of the members of the Gt, Gi, and G0 G protein subfamilies (Fig. 2A), and Cys-347 is the site of pertussis toxin modification in this subfamily(5.West R.E. Moss J. Vaughan M. Liu T. Liu T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14428-14430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These 2 residues are also part of a type II′β turn, which is required for Meta II stabilization(7.Dratz E.D. Fursteneau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Other residues conserved within the Giα/Gtα subfamily could be replaced only with amino acids having similar properties. Ile-340 is strictly conserved in this subfamily, and throughout G proteins it is generally only replaced with Leu (Fig. 2). Even among the most potent of the peptides (see below) Val, Leu, and Met substitution occurred, suggesting that several hydrophobic residues are acceptable. The large hydrophobic residues Phe or Tyr are found at the final position of Gi/Gtα subunits. Phenylalanine occurred almost exclusively in our study. The one exception, found in two of the sequences, was the much smaller hydrophobic residue, Leu. This did not appear to be detrimental, since it appeared in one of the more potent peptides, 9. Several other amino acids in the C-terminal 11 residues are generally conserved throughout known G protein α subunits, although Gsα and G15/16α are more heterogeneous than the others (Fig. 2A). Two Leu residues, Leu-344 and Leu-349, are absolutely conserved in all G proteins, yet in our peptides conservative substitutions were possible. Among the high affinity peptides, Leu-344 was always present, but Leu-349 was switched to Met in sequences 8 and 24. The conservation of hydrophobic residues at certain positions (340, 344, 349, and 350) suggests a hydrophobic component to the conserved binding pocket on the receptor. This, in fact, has been suggested by mutagenesis studies on muscarinic (18.Bluml K. Mutschler E. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7980-7984Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19.Moro O. Lameh J. Hogger P. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 268: 22273-22276Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and β-adrenergic (20.Cheung A.H. Huang R.R. Strader C.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1061-1065PubMed Google Scholar) receptors. As a rough indicator of potency, we initially examined the ability of the MBP fusion proteins to be competed off of light-activated rhodopsin by a single high concentration of Gtα-Ac-K341R-340-350. Presumably, those that were not well competed would be significantly more potent than the native peptide. Six of the least strongly competed MBP-peptide fusion proteins were then chosen for further study. The affinities of these fusion proteins for light-activated rhodopsin were estimated using a competition ELISA. The IC50 values of these six MBP-peptide fusions range from 3.8 to 42 nM, up to 3 orders of magnitude more potent than the 6 μM IC50 of MBP-Gtα-K341R-340-350 (encoded by plasmid pELM17) (Table 1). Gt, a much stronger competitor than its C-terminal peptide, was tested for its ability to compete with the purified MBP fusion proteins for binding to rhodopsin in the MBP ELISA. Gt, at 0.5 μM, inhibited binding of all six of the MBP fusion proteins, decreasing the signal by an average of 50% (Fig. 1B), indicating that these peptide sequences share the binding site on rhodopsin with Gt.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab C-terminal peptides of Gα subunits cannot only bind to their cognate receptors but can mimic the heterotrimeric G proteins' ability to affect receptor conformation and stabilize the active state(1.Hamm H.E.

At similar concentrations, the MBP protein alone (encoded by plasmid pELM6) had no effect. The high affinity fusion proteins derived from the combinatorial library were significantly more potent than MBP-Gtα-K341R-340-350 in their ability to stabilize Meta II (Fig. 3A). Their EC50 values ranged from 0.49 to 5.4 μM (Table 1). To examine the sequences directly, in the absence of the 43-kDa MBP fusion partner, we chemically synthesized the six 11-mer peptides (denoted “S”) and compared them with the Gtα-K341R-340-350 11-mer peptide. Dose-response studies in the competition ELISA revealed that the 11-mer peptides displayed higher binding affinity than the parent peptide by 2- (24S) to 300-fold (23S) (Table 1). The synthetic peptides were then tested for their ability to stabilize Meta II. The newly identified peptides were all significantly more potent than Gtα-K341R-340-350 in their ability to stabilize Meta II (Fig. 3B). Their EC50 values ranged from 0.76 (23S) to 152 (24S) μM, which is up to 290 times higher affinity than the parent sequence (Table 1). Additionally, these peptide sequences also appear to be potent antagonists of receptor activation of G proteins, since the peptides competitively inhibit the ability of light-activated rhodopsin to stimulate GTPγS binding to Gtα in a dose-dependent fashion. 2C. E. Ford and H. E. Hamm, unpublished observation. It is interesting to note that the relative potency of the 24S peptide decreased substantially in the absence of the fusion protein. In general, the MBP fusion proteins all appear to be of higher affinity than the peptides in both the binding and Meta II assays. This is probably due to the constraining effect on the N terminus of the peptide, which would lead to a decrease in conformational freedom. This difference between the fusion proteins and peptides was not as great in the Meta II assay, probably due to the higher sensitivity of the ELISA assay. “Extra” Meta II is measured as a tiny absorbance change (Δ0.02 absorbance unit), and to detect such a small change the concentration of rhodopsin must be high (>0.05 μM), thus limiting the dynamic range of the assay. To examine the effect of the added four random N-terminal amino acids, the full-length 15-mer peptides were also synthesized for clones 18 and 23 (peptides 18L and 23L) (Table 1). Although no obvious consensus sequences were present in the four random residues extended upstream from the core library, this region contributes to the increase in affinity in these two peptides. Peptide 18L is approximately 70- and 16-fold more potent than the corresponding 18S 11-mer peptide in the binding and Meta II assays, respectively, whereas this difference is only 3-fold for peptides 23L and 23S. By surveying a large number of peptide sequence possibilities unattainable by standard peptide synthetic techniques, we found several sequences that bind to rhodopsin with substantially higher affinity than the native sequence. Presumably, these analogues bind more tightly and dissociate at a slower rate. It is interesting that the screening procedure selected against a positive charge at position 341 but not at position 345 (Fig. 2B). In approximately 70% of the high affinity peptides from panning round 4 and all of the highest affinity peptides we fully characterized, the Lys-341/Arg-341 was changed to a non-charged group. This positive to neutral change correlates well with higher affinity. Such a change could have implications for the evolved functional properties of signaling pathways. In order to permit rapid and amplified information transfer, the receptor-G protein interaction must allow for rapid dissociation of the activated G protein. We described an activation-dependent conformational change of Gtα-Ac-K341R-340-350 in its rhodopsin-bound conformation by trNOESY and speculated that this conformational change is important for the highly amplified Gt activation process(7.Dratz E.D. Fursteneau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Especially marked changes occur in a helix-like tight turn at the N terminus involving Ile-340, Arg-341, Glu-342, and Asn-343, with formation of a salt bridge between Arg-341 and the free carboxyl of the C terminus in the inactive receptor-bound form and relaxation of this interaction in the activated form(7.Dratz E.D. Fursteneau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that the presence of a positive charge at position 341 might decrease the affinity of binding to receptor and increase the receptor's catalytic rate is directly testable using site-directed mutagenesis. Interestingly, a mutation that removes this positive charge (Arg-385 to His) has been reported to functionally uncouple G2 from its receptor in a patient with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy(21.Schwindinger W.F. Miric A. Zimmerman D. Levine M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25387-25391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It would be of interest to examine whether this mutation leads to a higher affinity for receptor. Other G proteins do not have a positive charge at this position (Fig. 2A), and we predict that these G proteins may have higher receptor affinity and lower activation rates. The crystal structure of Gtα has provided much information on its overall three-dimensional conformation(22.Noel J. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.A. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 23.Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). However, in the crystal structure of Gtα•GDP (which in combination with the βγ subunit is the rhodopsin binding conformation) the C-terminal region was disordered and not visible (23.Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Only in the GTPγS-bound form of Gtα could any structural features of the C terminus be discerned(22.Noel J. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.A. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Three possibilities are that 1) it is disordered and extended in the GDP-bound conformation in order to “sense” the activated receptor and conform to it by induced fit, 2) the disorder is an artifact of the crystal packing, or 3) it is disordered because it is missing an organizing site contributed by the N terminus, which was deleted from the Gtα used for crystal formation. In the absence of good crystallographic data on the C terminus, our data can be used to suggest an approximation of the tolerances of rhodopsin's binding site for the Gtα-340-350 region by utilizing a combination of information on the peptide side chains that can be accommodated in each position and the structural information obtained by trNOESY(7.Dratz E.D. Fursteneau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We have constructed surface models of the original peptide and a composite peptide containing the bulkiest side chain at each position from the six highest affinity peptides using trNOESY data from (7.Dratz E.D. Fursteneau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The resulting models show that both the native and modified peptides have two distinctly different “faces,” one polar and the other hydrophobic. Overall, there are only slight changes in the shape of the hydrophobic side of the two peptides. The polar face of the modified peptide does, however, appear to be less densely packed than the native peptide and more negatively charged because of the loss of the positive charge at position 341 (Fig. 4). The surfaces of these peptides should be complementary to their binding site on rhodopsin's cytoplasmic surface. The actual residues that contact rhodopsin are not known, and their identification would greatly facilitate our understanding of the critical point-to-point interactions required for receptor-G protein interaction. This paper has demonstrated the power of using a combinatorial library to develop potent peptide analogues useful in furthering our understanding of rhodopsin-Gt interactions, as well as having broader implications in the study of signal transduction systems. Additionally, this work will lay the structural framework by which therapeutic agents can be developed to interfere with signal transduction mediated via G proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2068335768,"The biological effect of type 1 interferons is proposed to arise in part from the conjugation of ubiquitin cross-reactive protein (UCRP), the ISG15 gene product, to intracellular target proteins in a process analogous to that of its sequence homolog ubiquitin, a highly conserved 8.6-kDa polypeptide whose ligation marks proteins for degradation via the 26 S proteasome. Inclusion of CoCl2 during the purification of recombinant UCRP blocks the proteolytic inactivation of the polypeptide occurring by cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal glycine dipeptide required for activation and subsequent ligation. Intact UCRP supports a low rate of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1)-dependent ATP:PPi exchange but fails to form a stoichiometric E1-UCRP thiol ester or undergo transfer to ubiquitin carrier protein (E2). The binding affinity of E1 for UCRP is significantly diminished relative to that of ubiquitin. These results suggest that UCRP conjugation proceeds through an enzyme pathway distinct from that of ubiquitin, at least with respect to the step of activation. This was confirmed for an in vitro conjugation assay in which 125I-UCRP could be ligated in an ATP-dependent reaction to proteins present within an A549 human lung carcinoma cell extract and could be competitively inhibited by excess unlabeled UCRP but not ubiquitin. Other results demonstrate that 125I-UCRP conjugation is significantly increased in cell extracts after 24 h of incubation in the presence of interferon-β, consistent with the late induction of UCRP conjugating activity. Thus, interferon-responsive cells contain a pathway for UCRP ligation that is parallel but distinct from that of ubiquitin. The biological effect of type 1 interferons is proposed to arise in part from the conjugation of ubiquitin cross-reactive protein (UCRP), the ISG15 gene product, to intracellular target proteins in a process analogous to that of its sequence homolog ubiquitin, a highly conserved 8.6-kDa polypeptide whose ligation marks proteins for degradation via the 26 S proteasome.

Thus, interferon-responsive cells contain a pathway for UCRP ligation that is parallel but distinct from that of ubiquitin. The interferons exert their biological effects through induction of a subset of cellular genes whose patterns of expression define the cell- and tissue-specific responses characteristic of these cytokines. Several of these interferon-induced genes have been the subject of considerable study (reviewed in (1.Sen G.C. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5017-5020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)); however, the mechanisms by which many of these proteins contribute to the interferon response remain poorly understood. One such protein within the latter group is the 15-kDa polypeptide originally identified by Farrell et al.(2.Farrell P.J. Broeze R.J. Lengyel P. Nature. 1979; 279: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and later characterized by Knight and co-workers(3.Blomstrom D.C. Fahey D. Kutny R. Korant B.D. Knight Jr., E. J. Biol.

Interferon-induced expression of the 15-kDa protein is regulated by an upstream interferon-stimulated response element typical of all early genes induced by type 1 interferons, IFN-α 1The abbreviations used are: IFNinterferonE1ubiquitin activating enzymeE2ubiquitin carrier proteinE3ubiquitin:protein isopeptide ligasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisUCRPubiquitin cross-reactive proteinDTTthiothreitolMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. and IFN-β(5.Reich N.

Subsequently, the sequence of the 15-kDa protein was noted to possess significant homology to a tandem diubiquitin sequence, accounting for its cross-reaction with affinity-purified anti-ubiquitin antibodies (6.Haas A.L. Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal LRLRGG sequence of ubiquitin essential for its conjugation to cellular proteins is conserved within the carboxyl terminus of the ubiquitin cross-reactive protein (UCRP), leading to the proposal that UCRP contributes to the type 1 interferon response through an analogous conjugation reaction(6.Haas A.L. Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, high molecular weight UCRP conjugates have been detected constitutively and within interferon-induced cultured cell lines using anti-UCRP-specific antibodies(7.Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. Mol. Cell.

Ubiquitin is one of the most highly conserved proteins found widely distributed among eucaryotes. The best studied function of ubiquitin is to target cellular proteins for degradation through a post-translational modification wherein the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin is covalently linked via isopeptide bond to primary amines on target proteins(9.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Heller H. Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1783-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The resulting conjugates are degraded by a multienzyme ATP-dependent pathway requiring the 26 S multicatalytic protease complex (proteasome)(10.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). Conjugation of ubiquitin to cellular proteins proceeds through a three-step pathway, reviewed in Hershko and Ciechanover (10.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar) and Pickart(11.Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. Ubiquitin. Plenum Press, New York1988: 77-99Crossref Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) catalyzes an ATP-coupled activation of the carboxyl-terminal glycine of ubiquitin to generate an enzyme-bound ubiquitin adenylate intermediate and free PPi(12.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfer of activated ubiquitin to an active site cysteine of E1 releases AMP and generates a covalent E1-ubiquitin thiol ester(12.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the second step, ubiquitin is transferred by transacylation to a cysteine residue conserved among all members of a family of ubiquitin carrier proteins, E2(13.Pickart C.M. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1573-1581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The third step involves aminolysis of these E2 thiol esters to form isopeptide bonds between the carboxyl-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and ϵ-amino groups of lysine residues on target proteins in both E3 (ubiquitin:protein ligase) -dependent and -independent mechanisms(15.Haas A. Reback P.M. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21664-21669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A persistent question has been whether the regulatory pathway of ubiquitin ligation is unique within the cell or if other similar pathways exist. Discovery of UCRP and its conjugates suggests such ligation events represent a general regulatory strategy within cells. However, a remaining unresolved question is whether ubiquitin and UCRP ligation mechanisms share a common set of enzymes or proceed through parallel but distinct pathways. In order to address the latter question, we have examined the ability of recombinant human UCRP to support the reaction catalyzed by ubiquitin-activating enzyme. The results suggest that conjugation of ubiquitin and UCRP proceed through distinct enzymes for their initial activation, a conclusion supported by competition studies utilizing an in vitro UCRP ligation assay. Bovine ubiquitin and yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase were purchased from Sigma. In all studies the absolute concentration of ubiquitin was determined using an empirically determined ϵ280 nm of 0.16 ml/mg•cm(16.Haas A.L. Wilkinson K.D. Prep. Biochem. 1985; 15: 49-60PubMed Google Scholar). Carboxypeptidase B was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Recombinant ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (L3) was a generous gift from Dr. Keith D. Wilkinson (Emory University Medical School). Human recombinant interferon bearing a C17S mutation to enhance stability (IFN-β) was supplied by Triton Biosciences. Carrier-free Na125I, [2,8-3H]ATP, and Na4[32P]PPi were obtained from DuPont NEN. Ubiquitin and UCRP were labeled with 125I by the chloramine-T (17.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6845-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and the IODO-GEN methods(18.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 345-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Precast isoelectric focusing gels having a broad pH range (3.5-9.5) were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) was purified by modification of the published procedure (14.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from rabbit reticulocytes, rabbit liver, and human erythrocytes. Isolation of mature recombinant UCRP was modified from the procedure of Loeb and Haas(7.Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All steps were conducted at 4°C and included 5 mM CoCl2 in buffers to prevent inactivation of the polypeptide by endogenous bacterial carboxypeptidase. Ten liters of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) harboring the pETUCRP expression plasmid were grown to OD600 nm of 0.8, then harvested after a 90-min induction in the presence of 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside(7.Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The centrifuged cells were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mM CoCl2 and lysed by French press. All intermediate steps were identical to those published previously with the exception that the unadsorbed fraction from the DE-52 column was concentrated in a 200-ml Amicon cell fitted with a PM10 membrane then dialyzed against 20 mM MOPS-Cl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 5 mM CoCl2. The dialyzate was adjusted to 1.6 M ammonium sulfate then applied to a 2.5 × 22-cm phenyl-Superose FAST column equilibrated in 20 mM MOPS-Cl (pH 7.2) containing 5 mM CoCl2 and 1.6 M ammonium sulfate. Recombinant UCRP was eluted from the phenyl-Superose column as a single peak using a negative linear gradient of ammonium sulfate (5 mM/ml). Following concentration in an Amicon cell fitted with a PM10 membrane, the sample was resolved on a 2.5 × 36-cm preparative column of Superdex-75 equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, and 5 mM CoCl2 to remove trace high molecular weight contaminants. Fractions containing UCRP were pooled and adjusted to 1 mM DTT, then dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM DTT. Concentration of the apparently homogeneous recombinant UCRP (>99% by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining) was determined spectrophotometrically using an ϵ280 nm of 0.82 ml/mg•cm(7.Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of CoCl2 to the buffers during purification precluded use of 1 mM DTT to eliminate dimerization of UCRP via the single cysteine residue(4.Knight Jr., E. Fahey D. Cordova B. Hillman M. Kutny R. Reich N. Blomstrom D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4520-4522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Loeb K.R. The Functional Characterization of the Ubiquitin Cross Reactive Protein, an Interferon Inducible Ubiquitin Homolog. Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI1993Google Scholar). The addition of 1 mM DTT to the final dialysis step resulted in a dark brown precipitate that was removed by centrifugation. Loss of protein in the precipitate was minimal. The ability of recombinant UCRP to substitute for ubiquitin was compared in three types of activity assays. Rates of ATP:PPi exchange were measured at 37°C in a final volume of 50 μl containing 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 2 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 μM32PPi (200 cpm/pmol), 1 mM DTT, 1 pmol of rabbit reticulocyte ubiquitin-activating enzyme, and a range of UCRP concentrations(12.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The incorporation of 32PPi into ATP was measured by adsorbing the resulting 32P-labeled ATP onto charcoal and counting the bound radioactivity by Cerenkov radiation(12.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecifically bound 32PPi was corrected by subtracting radioactivity in control incubations conducted in the absence of added E1(12.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Independent control experiments (not shown) demonstrated that residual CoCl2 remaining in the UCRP did not affect the rate of E1-catalyzed ATP:PPi exchange supported by equivalent concentrations of ubiquitin. The stoichiometry of E1-bound adenylate intermediate formation to either ubiquitin or UCRP was determined by measuring trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity in the presence of [2,8-3H]ATP(12.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubations were conducted at 37°C in a final volume of 50 μl containing 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 IU of inorganic pyrophosphatase, 1 mg/ml carrier bovine serum albumin, the indicated concentrations of [3H]ATP (2.5 × 104 cpm/pmol), and either ubiquitin or UCRP. Pyrophosphatase was omitted from equilibrium reactions used to determine internal E1 equilibrium constants in which PPi was present at the indicated concentrations. Data were corrected for nonspecific adsorption by subtracting radioactivity contained in control incubations from which E1 was omitted. The stoichiometry of 125I-ubiquitin or 125I-UCRP thiol ester formation on E1 was determined after resolving incubations by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, then determining 125I-associated radioactivity in the thiol ester band by γ counting(12.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubations were identical to those for measuring adenylate formation except that 2 mM unlabeled ATP was used in place of the radiolabeled nucleotide. Five pmol of rabbit liver E1 and 32 μM recombinant UCRP were used in the reaction at 37°C for 5 min. SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 4% SDS and 5 M urea was used to quench the reaction. β-Mercaptoethanol was excluded from the sample buffer. Due to covalent aggregation of 125I-UCRP during iodination and the low specific activity of radiolabeled polypeptide, Western blotting was used for the detection of E1-bound UCRP thiol ester(21.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were immunostained with 10 μg/ml affinity-purified anti-UCRP antibody followed by 125I-protein A and visualized by autoradiography. Control reactions were included in which E1 was quenched prior to addition of UCRP. A 7% gel was used to increase transfer efficiency and resolve the difference in electrophoretic mobility between the ubiquitin and UCRP thiol esters formed with E1. Confluent monolayer cultures of A549 human lung carcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cultures of A549 cells were induced by adding IFN-β to a final concentration of 1000 IU/ml(7.Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following 24 h of induction, cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, then harvested by scraping directly into 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.6) containing 2 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT (100 μl/100-mm plate). The cells were then briefly sonicated, and the extracts were used without further fractionation. Previously we have been unable to demonstrate conjugation of recombinant 125I-UCRP when added to fresh extracts of A549 cell(7.Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Loeb K.R. The Functional Characterization of the Ubiquitin Cross Reactive Protein, an Interferon Inducible Ubiquitin Homolog. Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI1993Google Scholar). In addition, recombinant UCRP failed to support E1-catalyzed ATP:PPi exchange (7.Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Loeb K.R. The Functional Characterization of the Ubiquitin Cross Reactive Protein, an Interferon Inducible Ubiquitin Homolog. Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI1993Google Scholar) in spite of the marked homology between UCRP and ubiquitin. The latter negative result suggested that either E1 was incapable of interacting with UCRP or that the recombinant protein was isolated in an inactive form. Subsequent experiments have confirmed that recombinant UCRP isolated as described previously (7.Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was inactive due to proteolytic cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal glycine dipeptide. Mature forms of ubiquitin and UCRP share a common LRLRGG carboxyl terminus(6.Haas A.L. Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that the carboxyl-terminal glycine dipeptide of ubiquitin is acutely sensitive to cleavage by trypsin-like activities(22.Haas A.L. Murphy K.E. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4694-4703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Wilkinson K.D. Audhya T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9235-9241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting des-Gly-Gly ubiquitin retains a pI characteristic of native ubiquitin(22.Haas A.L. Murphy K.E. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4694-4703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Wilkinson K.D. Audhya T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9235-9241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, removal of the carboxyl-terminal glycine dipeptide exposes Arg-74 which is subject to cleavage by carboxypeptidase B to yield a product exhibiting a pI shift to 5.4(22.Haas A.L. Murphy K.E. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4694-4703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Wilkinson K.D. Audhya T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9235-9241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of carboxypeptidase B for lysine and arginine precludes a similar pI shift for intact ubiquitin in which Arg-74 is masked by the glycine dipeptide (22.Haas A.L. Murphy K.E. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4694-4703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When a similar experiment was conducted with recombinant UCRP isolated by our published protocol(22.Haas A.L. Murphy K.E. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4694-4703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the polypeptide exhibited a shift in pI from the value of 6.7 characteristic of UCRP to 5.4 upon incubation with carboxypeptidase B (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). This indicated that the carboxyl-terminal glycine dipeptide was absent from UCRP. The pI shift upon incubation of ubiquitin with carboxypeptidase B was used as a convenient assay to test for carboxyl-terminal glycine dipeptide processing in BL21 extracts. These experiments revealed that the inactivating enzyme was a periplasmic carboxypeptidase similar in specificity to carboxypeptidase A; that is, the activity readily cleaved the glycine dipeptide from ubiquitin but failed to remove the resulting Arg-74 carboxyl terminus. Similar inactivating activity was found in all expression strains of E. coli tested, except for that of AR58 used in the heat-inducible expression of recombinant ubiquitin(24.Burch T.J. Haas A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the AR58 expression system was precluded for UCRP since the polypeptide fails to fold into a soluble, native conformation at the elevated temperature (42°C) required for induction(19.Loeb K.R. The Functional Characterization of the Ubiquitin Cross Reactive Protein, an Interferon Inducible Ubiquitin Homolog. Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI1993Google Scholar). Various inhibitors were unsuccessfully screened for their ability to block ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal inactivation by BL21 extracts. In contrast, 5 mM EDTA stimulated the rate of ubiquitin inactivation, suggesting that endogenous divalent metal(s) present in the lysates acted as natural inhibitors of the activity. Among the metal salts subsequently tested, CoCl2 was the most effective in inhibiting ubiquitin inactivation; therefore, 5 mM CoCl2 was included in all buffers used in the isolation of recombinant UCRP, since this concentration quantitatively blocks ubiquitin and UCRP glycine dipeptide excision. Recombinant UCRP purified in the presence of CoCl2 failed to show a pI shift upon incubation with carboxypeptidase B (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2), suggesting the presence of an intact native carboxyl terminus. However, the pI of UCRP shifted from 6.7 to 5.4 following successive incubation with carboxypeptidase A, to remove the glycine dipeptide, followed by carboxypeptidase B (not shown). This latter control experiment precluded the possibility that residual CoCl2 present in the UCRP preparation directly inhibited the activity of carboxypeptidase B. Recombinant UCRP purified in the presence of 5 mM CoCl2 was used in all subsequent enzymatic studies reported here. An obligatory step in the conjugation of ubiquitin, and presumably UCRP, requires activation of the polypeptide carboxyl terminus by E1(20.Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant intact UCRP was tested for its ability to support ATP:PPi exchange catalyzed by rabbit reticulocyte ubiquitin-activating enzyme. Initial rates of ATP:PPi exchange were measured at UCRP concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 μM in the presence of 20 nM E1, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The UCRP concentration dependence on the rates of isotope exchange displayed normal hyperbolic kinetics from which graphical analysis by double reciprocal plot (not shown) yielded estimates of kcat and K1/2 (Table 1). Since these measurements were conducted in the absence of added AMP, the kinetic constants reflect step 3 of the E1 reaction involving formation of the final ternary complex(12.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant UCRP exhibited a K1/2 value of 24 μM, 20-fold greater than the value of 1.2 μM reported for step 3 in the ubiquitin-supported reaction(12.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the kcat for UCRP of 0.026 s−1 is 370-fold lower than the value of 9.6 s−1 determined for ubiquitin(12.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Qualitatively similar results were obtained with rabbit liver E1 (not shown).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Subsequent rate studies using UCRP preparations having variable amounts of intact carboxyl terminus yielded comparable values of kcat but different values for K1/2 that were inversely proportional to the fraction of total UCRP possessing an intact carboxyl terminus, as judged by relative Coomassie staining intensity in the pI shift assay following incubation with carboxypeptidase B (not shown). The latter observations are consistent with the inability of des-Gly-Gly UCRP to support the E1-catalyzed reaction. The dependence of ubiquitin concentration on E1-catalyzed ATP:PPi exchange exhibits pronounced substrate inhibition at high concentrations, characteristic of the obligatory ordered addition of substrates for which ATP binds prior to ubiquitin(12.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no substrate inhibition was observed at the highest concentration of UCRP tested (50 μM), presumably because this concentration remains below the zone of inhibition for the polypeptide. Insolubility of UCRP at higher concentrations prevented testing for substrate inhibition by UCRP. The ATP:PPi exchange reaction proceeds through a tightly E1-bound (Kd≤ 10−14M) (12.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Burch T.J. Haas A.L.

Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the low kcat observed for UCRP could result in part from a stoichiometry of UCRP adenylate formation less than that found for ubiquitin adenylate. Formation of ubiquitin and UCRP adenylates were quantitated by trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity in the presence of [2,8-3H]ATP as described under “Materials and Methods.” In the presence of 1 pmol of E1 and inorganic pyrophosphatase, ubiquitin rapidly formed an equivalent amount of ubiquitin [3H]adenylate within a 1-min incubation (not shown), as reported previously(12.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, UCRP [3H]adenylate formation was only 0.11 pmol after 5 min under identical conditions (not shown). The low level of UCRP [3H]adenylate formation was not a kinetic effect since the amount of intermediate was unaltered by longer incubation. Subsequent kinetic studies demonstrated that UCRP [3H]adenylate formation was first order with a rate constant of 0.42 min−1. Since ubiquitin [3H]adenylate formation is complete within 1 min, an analogous rate constant for formation of this intermediate could not be determined, as has been noted previously(24.Burch T.J. Haas A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); however, a lower limit of ≥6 min−1 could be estimated based on the limit of detection for this assay(24.Burch T.J. Haas A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, the substoichiometric formation of UCRP [3H]adenylate probably results in part from a lower rate of intermediate formation. Recent studies by Burch and Haas (24.Burch T.J. Haas A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have shown that mutagenesis of specific ubiquitin residues sufficiently compromises binding of the resulting adenylate within the E1 active site to allow dissociation of the intermediate. The free but not the bound pool of ubiquitin [3H]adenylate is sensitive to cleavage by ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase(24.Burch T.J. Haas A.L.

Despite the central role of SMCs in vascular biology, relatively little is currently understood about the molecular mechanisms that control SMC lineage specification, differentiation, and phenotypic modulation. This is due, in part, to the fact that relatively few SMC lineage-specific markers have been identified and to the poorly understood embryological origin(s) of the SMC lineage(s) (18.Nishida W.

Biol. 1992; 153: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Two species of calponin mRNA, designated h1 and h2, have been identified, each of which is encoded by a separate gene(32.Strasser P. Gimona M. Moessler H. Herzog M. Small J.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only the h1 protein product is detectable in SMC-containing tissues(32.Strasser P. Gimona M. Moessler H. Herzog M. Small J.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, a non-muscle acidic isoform of calponin with distinct functional properties has recently been described(33.Applegate D. Feng W. Green R.S. Taubman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10683-10690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several findings suggest that calponin may regulate SMC contraction: (i) calponin binds to the thin filament proteins actin, tropomyosin, calmodulin, and caltropin(34.Takahashi K. Hiwada K. Kokubu T.

Takahashi K. Maruyama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and (v) calponin decreases the rate of cross-bridge cycling and increases maximum force production by smooth muscle myosin (43.Haeberle J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12424-12431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these in vitro findings, the molecular mechanism by which calponin regulates smooth muscle cell contraction in vivo remains unknown.In the studies described in this report, we have used the murine calponin-h1 cDNA as a molecular probe to define the spatial and temporal pattern of calponin-h1 gene expression during development. In addition, we have isolated and structurally characterized a murine calponin-h1 genomic clone and performed a series of transient transfection analyses using calponin/luciferase reporter plasmids. These studies demonstrated that the calponin-h1 gene is expressed in a developmentally regulated, SMC-specific pattern. The 10.7-kb calponin-h1 gene is a single copy gene that is a member of a multigene family composed of proteins with an evolutionarily conserved actin-binding domain. Finally, transient transfection analyses demonstrate that the murine calponin-h1 promoter programs high level transcription of a luciferase reporter gene in primary cultures of rat aortic SMCs and the SMC line, A7r5. Taken together, these data suggest that the murine calponin-h1 gene should serve as an excellent model system in which to examine the transcriptional mechanisms that control SMC lineage specification and differentiation.MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation of Murine Calponin-h1 cDNAsThe coding region (bp 98-988) of the murine calponin-h1 cDNA was isolated by performing reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using murine uterine RNA and synthetic 5′- and 3′-oligonucleotide primers constructed from the previously published sequence of the mouse calponin-h1 cDNA (GenBank Accession No. Z19542) as described previously(44.Parmacek M.S. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13217-13225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 891-bp reaction product (excluding the restriction enzyme sites) was subcloned into BamHI-HindIII-digested pGEM7Z (Promega) and was utilized for genomic screening, Southern blot, and Northern blot analyses. In addition, a 467-bp murine calponin-h1 cDNA fragment (bp 193-659), derived from the coding region of the cDNA, and a 746-bp cDNA fragment (bp 659-1404), derived from the coding region and 3′-untranslated region of the calponin-h1 cDNA were isolated using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using murine uterine RNA and synthetic 5′- and 3′-oligonucleotide primers as described previously (44.Parmacek M.S. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13217-13225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and utilized for in situ hybridization analyses.Isolation of Murine Calponin-h1 Genomic ClonesApproximately 1 × 106 recombinant phage from a murine 129SV Lambda FIX II genomic library (Stratagene) were screened with the radiolabeled 891-bp murine calponin-h1 cDNA probe, and positively hybridizing clones were purified to homogeneity as described previously(44.Parmacek M.S.

Each clone was analyzed by Southern blot analysis, and one clone spanning the length of the gene (mCalp-5A) including approximately 6 kb of 5′-flanking sequence was used for all subsequent experiments.Cell Culture and Cell Cycle AnalysesThe rat A7r5 cell line, which was derived from embryonic thoracic aorta, were grown as described previously(46.Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E. Niu Q. Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13460-13469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Murine NIH 3T3 cells, C3H10T1/2 cells, Sol8 myoblasts and myotubes, human HepG2 cells, and murine EL-4 cells were grown as described previously(46.Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E.

Primary rat aortic SMCs were isolated from 12-16-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously(47.Chang M.W. Barr E. Seltzer J. Jiang Y.-Q. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. Parmacek M.S. Leiden J.M. Science. 1995; 267: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Virtually all cells isolated using this method stain positive with anti-smooth muscle actin monoclonal antibodies(47.Chang M.W. Barr E. Seltzer J. Jiang Y.-Q. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. Parmacek M.S. Leiden J.M. Science. 1995; 267: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In all experiments, only second or third passage SMCs were utilized. For the cell cycle analyses, SMCs from the third passage were placed in serum-free medium (50% Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, 50% Ham's F-12, L-glutamine (292 mg/ml), insulin (5 mg/ml), transferrin (5 mg/ml), selenious acid (5 ng/ml)) for 72 h to synchronize the cells in G0/G1. Following 72 h of serum starvation, cells were stimulated to proliferate by incubation in medium containing 45% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 45% Ham's F-12, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell cycle analysis was performed on propidium iodide-stained SMCs 0-, 8-, 12-, 16- and 24-h post-serum stimulation by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using a Becton Dickinson FACSCAN and CellFIT computer software as described previously(47.Chang M.W.

Science. 1995; 267: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar).DNA and RNA Blot AnalysesHigh molecular weight DNA was prepared from strain 129SV mice as described previously(44.Parmacek M.S. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13217-13225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Southern blot analyses were performed using the radiolabeled 891-bp murine calponin cDNA probe under the high and low stringency conditions described previously(44.Parmacek M.S. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13217-13225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Northern blot analyses, RNA was prepared from tissues isolated from 12-week-old 129SV mice (Jackson Laboratories) as described previously(44.Parmacek M.S. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13217-13225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, RNA was prepared from cultures of primary rat aortic SMCs and a variety of smooth muscle and non-muscle cell lineages as described previously (47.Chang M.W. Barr E. Seltzer J. Jiang Y.-Q. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. Parmacek M.S. Leiden J.M. Science. 1995; 267: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Northern blotting was performed as described previously(44.Parmacek M.S. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13217-13225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Probes included the 891-bp murine calponin cDNA probe and the 4.7-kb full-length human retinoblastoma (Rb) gene product cDNA probe (which cross-hybridizes to the murine Rb mRNA) that was generously provided by William Kaelin (Dana Farber Cancer Institute). Quantitative image analyses were performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA).In Situ HybridizationsIn situ hybridization was performed essentially as described by Eichele and co-workers(49.Kuratani S. Martin J.F. Wawersik S. Lilly B. Eichele G. Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1994; 161: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The murine calponin-h1 cDNA subcloned into pGEM11Z was in vitro transcribed using T7 or SP6 polymerase, respectively, in the presence of 35S-labeled UTP to generate sense and antisense cRNA probes, respectively. Hybridizations were performed in 50% formamide, 0.3 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 500 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 250 nM α-thio-ATP, 1 × 105 dpm/μl of the 35S-labeled cRNA probe (0.3 mg/ml final probe concentration). Following hybridization, slides were washed, digested with RNase, dehydrated, and air dried. Finally, emulsion autoradiography was performed, and the sections were post-stained with Hoecht 33258 and visualized by epifluorescence and darkfield microscopy on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. To detect nonspecific background, hybridization was performed with the radiolabeled sense calponin-h1 riboprobe to alternate sections under identical conditions.Primer Extension and RNase Protection AnalysesA 35-mer oligonucleotide probe constructed to include the reverse complement of base pairs +80 to +115 of the previously published murine calponin-h1 cDNA (GenBank Accession No. Z19542) (32.Strasser P. Gimona M. Moessler H. Herzog M. Small J.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (5′-AAATGTGCAGAAGACATGCTGGCCAGGGGGCTCTG-3′) was 5′-end-labeled and hybridized to 40 μg of mouse uterine RNA as described previously (46.Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E. Niu Q. Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13460-13469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Primer extension reactions were performed at 42, 50, and 56°C as described previously(46.Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E. Niu Q. Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol.

RNase protection analyses were performed by subcloning a murine XbaI-BbsI calponin-h1 genomic subfragment (bp −427 to +97, Fig. 6C) into pGEM7Z and performing in vitro transcription of the antisense strand of the AvrII-linearized plasmid (which cuts at bp −160) using SP6 polymerase to obtain an antisense probe of 257 bp. The 257-bp probe was labeled with [α-32P]UTP, and RNase protection analyses were performed as described previously (46.Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E. Niu Q. Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S.

Biol. 1992; 12: 1967-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The pGL2-Control plasmid (Promega) contains the SV40 promoter and transcriptional enhancer and the luciferase reporter gene. The p-3400cal/luc plasmid, containing approximately 3.4 kb of calponin-h1 5′-flanking sequence subcloned 5′ of the luciferase reporter gene, was constructed by first subcloning the 2.7-kb KpnI-EcoRI calponin-h1 genomic subfragment (extending from bp ~-3400 to −706) into KpnI-EcoRI-digested pGEM7Z. Next, the EcoRI-linkered 802-bp EcoRI-BbsI calponin-h1 genomic subfragment (extending from bp −705 to bp +97) was subcloned into the EcoRI-digested vector, and its orientation relative to the 2.7-kb KpnI-EcoRI calponin subfragment was confirmed by restriction enzyme analyses. Finally, the pGEM7Z vector containing the calponin-h1 3.5-kb genomic subfragment was digested with KpnI and XhoI, and the resulting genomic subfragment was ligated into KpnI-XhoI-digested pGL2-Basic vector. The −1500cal/luc plasmid, containing approximately 1.5 kb of calponin-h1 5′-flanking sequence linked to the luciferase reporter gene, was constructed by subcloning the KpnI-linkered 1.5-kb BbsI calponin-h1 genomic subfragment (extending from approximately bp ~-1500 to +97) into KpnI-digested pGL2-Basic vector. The orientation of the genomic subfragment relative to the luciferase reporter gene (5′ to 3′) was confirmed by restriction endonuclease and dideoxy DNA sequence analyses.Transfections and Luciferase AssaysA7r5 cells were transfected using 50 μg of Lipofectin reagent, 15 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, and 5 μg of the pMSVβgal reference plasmid as reported previously(46.Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E. Niu Q. Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13460-13469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition, to optimize for expression of the calponin-h1 gene in primary rat aortic SMCs (the gene is down-regulated in late passage and/or proliferating SMCs), 2 × 106 second passage primary rat aortic SMCs were plated on 90-mm dishes and grown to confluence. The cells were then incubated for 5 h with 100 μg of Lipofectin reagent, 15 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, and 5 μg of the pMSVβgal reference plasmid. Following transfection, cell lysates were prepared as described previously(48.Parmacek M.S. Vora A.J. Shen T.E. Barr E. Jung F. Leiden J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1967-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were normalized for protein content (Bio-Rad) and the expressed luciferase activities (light units) were corrected for variations in transfection efficiencies as determined by assaying cell extracts for β-galactosidase activities. All experiments were repeated at least three times to ensure reproducibility and permit the calculation of standard errors. Data are expressed as normalized light units ± S.E.RESULTSSMC Lineage-restricted Expression of the Calponin-h1 GenePrevious studies have suggested that the thin filament protein calponin is expressed exclusively in SMC-containing tissues (11.Gimona M.

To determine the in vivo pattern of calponin-h1 gene expression in adult mice, the calponin-h1 cDNA was hybridized to Northern blots containing RNAs prepared from 12-week-old mouse tissues. As shown in Fig. 1A, the murine calponin-h1 cDNA hybridized to a single mRNA species of approximately 1.5 kb (arrow). In adult mice, the calponin-h1 gene is expressed at high levels in SMC-containing tissues including aorta, small intestine, lung, and uterus. Prolonged autoradiographic exposure demonstrated a low intensity hybridization signal in both the heart and thymus. The faint hybridization signal of approximately 1.2 kb represents cross-hybridization to the structurally related SMC-specific protein SM22α(46.Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E.

The calponin-h1 cDNA probe hybridized to a 1.5-kb species of mRNA (arrow) present in primary VSMCs, A7r5 cells, and C2C12 myoblasts. The bottom panel shows an ethidium bromide-stained formaldehyde-containing gel prior to transfer of RNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the cell specificity of calponin-h1 gene expression, the calponin-h1 cDNA probe was hybridized to Northern blots containing RNAs prepared from freshly isolated primary rat aortic SMCs, the smooth muscle cell line, A7r5, murine NIH 3T3 and C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts, the monkey SV-40 transformed kidney cell line, COS-7, murine Sol8 myoblasts and myotubes, the human hepatocellular carcinoma-derived cell line, HepG2, and the murine lymphoid cell line, EL-4. High levels of calponin-h1 mRNA were detected in primary rat aortic SMCs and the smooth muscle cell line, A7r5 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2), while the gene was not expressed in other cell lines including NIH 3T3, C3H10T1/2, COS-7, Sol8, Hep G2, and EL-4 cells even after prolonged autoradiographic exposure. Thus, calponin is expressed in a lineage-restricted fashion in primary vascular SMCs and the SMC line, A7r5.Developmental Regulation of Calponin-h1 Gene Expression in VivoTo determine the temporal and spatial patterns of calponin-h1 gene expression during mouse development, a series of in situ hybridization experiments were performed on staged murine embryos using radiolabeled antisense and sense (control) calponin-h1 cRNA probes derived from both the coding and 3′-untranslated regions of the murine calponin-h1 cDNA. In postcoital day (E) 9.5 mouse embryos, calponin-h1 mRNA was abundantly expressed in the aortic outflow tract or truncus arteriosus (open arrow), dorsal aorta (white arrow), as well as the developing heart tube (Fig. 2A). Of note, several studies suggest that the SMCs in the aortic outflow tract are derived from the neural crest, while those in the dorsal aorta are derived from the lateral plate mesoderm(50.Beall A.C.

Using polyclonal antibodies to skeletal muscle triadin, we have identified and characterized three isoforms in rabbit cardiac muscle. The cDNAs encoding these three isoforms of triadin have been isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and cDNA library screening. The deduced amino acid sequences show that these proteins are identical in their N-terminal sequences, whereas the C-terminal sequences are distinct from each other and from that of skeletal muscle triadin. Based upon both the amino acid sequences and biochemical analysis, all three triadin isoforms share similar membrane topology with skeletal muscle triadin. Immunofluorescence staining of rabbit cardiac muscle with antibodies purified from the homologous region of triadin shows that cardiac triadin is primarily confined to the I-band region of cardiac myocytes, where the junctional and corbular sarcoplasmic reticulum is located. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the conserved region of the luminal domain of triadin is able to bind both the ryanodine receptor and calsequestrin in cardiac muscle.

Nine mammalian enzymes, two Drosophila enzymes, one Dictyostelium enzyme, and one yeast enzyme have to date been characterized at the cDNA level; all are single polypeptides and can be divided into three types (β, β γ, and δ) on the basis of size and amino acid sequence(3.Rhee S.G.

The amino acid sequences of PLC isozymes are relatively variable with the exception of two well conserved regions, identified as the X (~170 amino acid residues) and Y (~260 residues) domains, that appear to constitute the catalytic site. The amino acid sequence similarity in the X and Y domains is ~60 and 40%, respectively, among the nine mammalian enzymes(3.Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Rhee S.G. Liscovitch M. Signal-activated Phospholipases. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1994: 1-12Google Scholar); the similarity is greater when members of the same type of PLC are compared. The sequence between the X and Y domains is short (40-110 residues) in the β- and β-type isozymes. However, in γ-type isozymes, this region is much longer (~400 residues) and contains two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which bind phosphotyrosine-containing sequences in other proteins, and one SH3 domain, which interacts with proline-rich sequences in cytoskeletal proteins(5.Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar, 6.Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Furthermore, unlike δ- and ε-type enzymes, β type isozymes have a long carboxyl-terminal sequence (~450 residues) downstream of the Y domain. All mammalian and Drosophila PLCs possess an amino-terminal region of ~300 residues that precedes the X domain and contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The PH domain is a loosely conserved protein module of ~100 amino acids and targets various proteins to the membrane surface by interacting with either the ββ subunits of G proteins or PIP2(7.Lee S.B. Rhee S.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 8.Inglese J. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 151-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The various PLC isoforms appear to be activated by different receptors through different mechanisms. Activation of γ-type enzymes is achieved by phosphorylation by autophosphorylated tyrosine kinases as a result of binding to these kinases via the SH2 domains. Isozymes of the β type are activated as a result of binding either to the α subunits of Gq class G proteins, via the long carboxyl-terminal region, or to Gββγ subunits, probably through the PH domain(4.Rhee S.G. Liscovitch M. Signal-activated Phospholipases. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1994: 1-12Google Scholar, 9.Bristol J.A. Rhee S.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 5: 402-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Regulation of δ-type enzymes is not yet understood. Despite the presence of PH domains in γ- and δ-type enzymes, there is no evidence that these isozymes are modulated by Gββγ subunits. As part of our continuing effort to detect previously unidentified PLC isoforms and gather clues pointing to a regulatory mechanism for γ-type PLC enzymes, we screened a rat brain cDNA library by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with oligonucleotide primers based on the amino acid sequences conserved in the X and Y domains of δ-type isozymes. Here, we now describe the molecular cloning of a cDNA corresponding to a new δ-type PLC, named PLC-δ4. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of all known PLC isozymes reveals several regions of highly conserved sequences within the X and Y domains(2.Choi K.D. Rhee S.G. Putney Jr., J.W. Advances in Second Messenger and Phosphoprotein Research. Raven Press, New York1992: 35-61Google Scholar, 3.Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol.

Three blocks of conserved amino acids, SSHNTYL, (E/M/K)P(I/V/F)(I/V)(Y/T)HG, and (I/V)(L/I)(V/L/I)K(G/N/H)KKL, in the X domain were chosen for the synthesis of forward oligonucleotide primers. Two reverse primers were synthesized on the basis of conserved sequences, G(W/L/T/Q)R(T/V/M/L)(D/N)S(S/A)N and VA(L/M)N(F/M)QT, in the Y domain. The sequences of the primers (named after the first two amino acid residues of the corresponding conserved sequence) were as follows: primer SS, CGGAATTCTCITCICA(C/T)AA(C/T)AC(C/G)TA(C/T)CT; primer EP, CGGAATTCGA(G/A)CCI(A/G)TI(A/G)T(T/C)TA(C/T)CA(C/T)GG; primer IL, CGGAATTCT(C/T)IT(G/C/T)ITGAA(G/A)GGIAAGAAGCT; primer GW, CGGCATGCTTIG(A/C)IGA(A/G)T(C/T)I(G/A)TIC(T/G)C(C/A)(G/A)ICC; and primer VA, CGGCATGCGT(C/T)TGIA(A/T)(G/A)TTIA(G/T/A)IGCIAC. The underlined sequences at the 5′-end of each oligonucleotide indicate restriction enzyme cleavage sites (EcoRI and SphI sites for the forward and reverse primers, respectively) and two nucleotides (CG) added to facilitate cloning of PCR products. Primers SS and VA were based on amino acid sequences common to all three types of PLC, whereas the remaining three primers were based on sequences specific to δ-type isozymes. Three sequential PCR amplifications were performed with the GeneAmp PCR system 9600 (Perkin Elmer Corp.). A rat brain cDNA library in the Uni-ZAP XR vector (Stratagene) was used as the template for the first amplification reaction. The reaction mixture contained 0.5 μl of library (1 × 107 plaque-forming units), 50 pmol of each of the primers SS and VA, 0.1 mM dNTPs, 1 unit of native Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer Corp.), and the manufacturer's buffer in a final volume of 50 μl. Amplification was performed for one cycle of 5 min at 80°C, 3 min at 95°C, 15 s at 45°C, and 30 s at 72°C, followed by 44 cycles of a 15-s denaturating step at 94°C, a 15-s annealing step at 45°C, and a 30-s extension step at 72°C (the final extension step was prolonged to 5 min). Although sequences corresponding to primers SS and VA are present in all three types of PLC isozymes, the efficiency of amplification of PLC-γ sequences was expected to be low because of the long distance (~1.7 kb) between the two primer sites. To eliminate products amplified from the cDNA sequences of PLC-β1 and PLC-β1, two abundant PLC isoforms in brain, the products of the first amplification were treated with HindIII and AflIII, which cleave a 908-bp product derived from the PLC-β1 sequence and a 833-bp product derived from the PLC-δ1 sequence, respectively. The second amplification reaction was performed with the more internal, δ type-specific primers EP and GW and with the restriction enzyme-treated products from the first amplification reaction as the template. The reaction mixture contained 0.2 μl of template and the same reaction components as for the first PCR. DNA amplification was achieved by 35 cycles with steps similar to those described above, with the exception that annealing was performed at 50°C. The products of the second amplification were subjected to digestion with AflIII, XhoI (which cleaves PLC-δ2 sequence), and PstI (which cleaves PLC-δ3 sequence). The products from the second amplification reaction were then further amplified with the innermost δ-specific primer, IL, and GW. The reaction was performed for 30 cycles under the same conditions as for the second PCR. Amplified DNA was digested with EcoRI and SphI, and the products were separated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. A 426-bp oligonucleotide was cut and electroeluted from the gel, purified, and ligated into pUC19 vector. DNA sequencing was performed according to the Taq dye primer cycle sequencing method and Taq dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing method on an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 373A). The 426-bp oligonucleotide revealed a PLC-like sequence that differed from the sequences corresponding to known PLC isozymes. A 312-bp 32P-labeled probe was prepared by PCR in the presence of [32P]dCTP with the 426-bp fragment as the template. The size of the probe was reduced (from 426 to 312 bp) to remove sequences corresponding to the X and Y domains, thus preventing hybridization to a known PLC sequence through the residual X and Y sequences. The radiolabeled probe was used to screen the rat brain cDNA library. Standard methods (10.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used for hybridization, cloning of DNA fragments from positive plaques into pBluescript SK vector (Stratagene), transforming Escherichia coli with the recombinant plasmids, and determining the nucleotide sequence of the cloned inserts. These procedures yielded two clones with a 2.7-kb insert that contained a full-length open reading frame for a PLC-like enzyme, a potential translational termination codon, and a poly(A) tail. cDNA encoding the entire rat PLC-δ4 sequence was subcloned into the pTM1 vaccinia virus expression vector(11.Elroy-Stein O. Fuerst T.R. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding PLC-δ4 were generated by transfecting PTM1-PLC-δ4 into CV-1 cells, which had been infected with wild type vaccinia virus(12.Lee S.B. Shin S.H. Hepler J.R.

For the purification of PLC-δ4, HeLa cells were grown at 37°C to a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml in MEM spinner medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, infected at a ratio of 10 viruses per cell with the recombinant virus and a vTF7-3 recombinant vaccinia virus that contained the bacterial T7 RNA polymerase gene, and harvested 2 days after infection(12.Lee S.B.

Cell pellets (80 ml) were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in 2 volumes of homogenation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), and aprotinin (10 μg/ml)), and were disrupted by sonication. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the resulting supernatant (200 ml) was collected and divided into five 40-ml portions, each of which was applied to a preparative TSKgel DEAE-5PW HPLC column (21.5 × 150 mm) that had been equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM EGTA and 0.1 mM DTT. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 5 ml/min with linear gradients of 0-0.3 M NaCl for 35 min and 0.3-1 M NaCl for 5 min. Fractions (5 ml) were collected and assayed for PLC as described(13.Lee C.-W. Park D.J. Lee K.-H. Kim C.G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21318-21327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fractions (49-51 min) corresponding to the second peak of phosphatidylinositol-hydrolyzing activity from each column were pooled and concentrated. The subsequent three chromatography steps on a preparative TSKgel phenyl-5PW column, a TSKgel heparin-5PW column, and a Mono Q column were performed according to procedures similar to those previously described(13.Lee C.-W. Park D.J. Lee K.-H. Kim C.G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21318-21327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to PLC-δ4 amino acid residues 454-464 (KDEGSDLDPAS) and residues 759-772 (VYTCMQEDLDMDEP) were synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with glutaraldehyde. Antisera to the peptides were generated separately in rabbits, and specific antibodies were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with purified PLC-δ4 protein. Frozen rat tissues that had been harvested in liquid nitrogen were purchased from Pel-Freeze Biologicals. Regenerating liver was prepared from partially hepatectomized Sprague-Dawley rats 24 h after removal of approximately two-thirds of the liver mass(14.Asano M. Tamiya-Koizumi K. Homma Y. Takenawa T. Nimura Y. Kojima K. Yoshida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12360-12366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each tissue (5-10 g) was thawed in 50 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and calpain inhibitors I and II (each at 4 μg/ml)) and homogenized in a glass homogenizer with a motor-driven Teflon pestle (10 strokes). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 2 M KCl by adding solid KCl, stirred for 2 h at 4°C, and then centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of homogenization buffer and again centrifuged. The supernatant (100-200 mg of protein) was applied to a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column (20 ml of gel packed in a 1.5 × 15 cm Econo column) that had been equilibrated with 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM EGTA and 0.1 mM DTT. Bound proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 4 ml/min with the equilibration buffer containing 1.2 M NaCl. Fractions (16 ml) were collected and assayed for PLC activity. Essentially all detectable PLC activity eluted in six fractions, which were pooled and concentrated in a stirred ultrafiltration cell fitted with a YM 30 membrane (Amicon). After the final NaCl concentration was adjusted to 50 mM, the concentrate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min. Proteins (20 mg) from the supernatant were injected into a TSKgel heparin-5PW HPLC column (7.5 × 75 mm) and fractionated as described previously(13.Lee C.-W. Park D.J. Lee K.-H. Kim C.G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21318-21327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and assayed for PLC activity. For immunoblot analysis, fractions were concentrated with Centricon-30 (Amicon), and one-fourth of the pooled peak fractions (61-64 min) from each tissue was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7% gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with purified antibodies to PLC-δ4, and immune complexes were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and various tissues were collected in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated from these frozen tissues by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method, and poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA with Oligotex-dT (Qiagen). RT-PCR was carried out with a StrataScript kit (Stratagene). First-strand cDNAs were synthesized with 100 ng of poly(A)+ RNA from each tissue and 300 ng of oligo(dT) primer in a 50-μl reverse transcriptase reaction mixture. The first-strand products were amplified with two sets of PLC-δ4-specific primers (first set, nucleotides (nt) 1108-1130 and 1640-1662; second set, nt 1305-1325 and 1516-1535 (nucleotides were numbered beginning with the first residue of the ATG initiation codon; those on the 5′-side of residue 1 are indicated by negative numbers)) by two consecutive rounds of PCR. The first amplification was performed for 30 cycles of 15 s at 94°C, 15 s at 60°C, and 30 s at 72°C with 3 μl of the cDNA products and the first set of primers; the final extension step was increased to 5 min. The second-round amplification was achieved by 20 cycles with the second set of primers and 0.5 μl of the first-round PCR products as template. The final products were separated on a 1.8% agarose gel. The expected 230-bp oligonucleotide was amplified specifically from PLC-δ4 cDNA. A measure of the efficiency of cDNA synthesis and the ability of the resulting cDNA to serve as a template for amplification was obtained for each of the RNA samples by amplifying the first-strand products with rat β-actin primers (Clontech); 30 cycles of PCR were performed under the same conditions as described above, and a 764-bp fragment was amplified. RT-PCR of rat testis poly(A)+ RNA yielded 330- and 270-bp bands in addition to the 230-bp band. These two additional fragments were subcloned directly into the pGEM-T plasmid vector (Promega). Restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing of these two fragments revealed that an additional 96 and 42 nt, respectively, were inserted immediately before the Y region of the PLC-δ4 open reading frame. To determine whether these two additional fragments were amplified from alternatively spliced forms of PLC-δ4 mRNA in testis, the entire coding region of PLC-δ4 cDNA was amplified with two sets of primers (first set, nt −115-95 and 2421-2444; second set, nt −58-35 and 2477-2497), all of which corresponded to the 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions of the cDNA. Two rounds of PCR were performed as described above but with a 1-min extension step. The second-round PCR products were digested with StuI and EcoRI for restriction enzyme analysis. PLC-δ4 cDNA contains only one site for each of these two restriction enzymes; thus, digestion of the second-round PCR products should yield three distinct fragments of 1493, 597, and 411 bp. The presence of additional two forms of PLC-δ4 cDNA in testis would be expected to result in the generation of additional 507- and 453-bp fragments. The existence of previously unidentified PLC-δ isozymes was investigated by subjecting a rat brain cDNA library to three sequential PCR amplifications. Five blocks of conserved amino acid sequences, three (SS, EP, and IL) from the X domain and two (GW and VA) from the Y domain, were chosen for the synthesis of degenerate oligonucleotide primers. The outermost pair of primers (SS and VA) was used for the first PCR amplification and was based on sequences common to all three types of PLC isozymes, whereas the other three primers (EP, IL, and GW), used for the second (EP and GW) and third (IL and GW) PCR amplifications, were specific to δ-type isoforms. The first- and second-round PCR products were treated with restriction enzymes known to cleave sequences corresponding to various PLC isozymes before serving as templates for the next round of PCR. The link between the X and Y domains of PLC isozymes varies both in length and sequence. Thus, whereas the presence of conserved residues in the X and Y domains identifies a PCR product as a member of the PLC family, a comparison of the linker sequence with known sequences further reveals whether it represents a newly discovered PLC-δ. The third PCR amplification yielded a 426-bp fragment that revealed a PLC-like sequence distinct from those of known PLC isozymes. Removal of the sequences corresponding to the X and Y domains yielded a 312-bp fragment that was used as a probe to screen the rat brain library. Two clones with a 2.7-kb insert were obtained. Complete sequencing of these two clones revealed an open reading frame of 2,316 bp flanked by a 142-bp 5′-untranslated region and a 255-bp 3′-untranslated region including a poly(A) tail. The translational initiation site (ATG) was assigned to the first methionine codon at nt 143 because of the presence of an in-frame stop codon upstream of this methionine and flanking sequences that fulfill the Kozak criteria for initiation(15.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). An in-frame translational termination codon (TGA) was present after codon 772. Therefore, we concluded that this new PLC contained 772 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 88,966 daltons (Fig. 1A). A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with known PLC sequences revealed that the predicted protein was similar in primary structure and overall structural organization to PLC-δ type isozymes, with overall sequence identities of 45, 72, and 47% to PLC-δ1, PLC-δ2, and PLC-δ3, respectively. Thus, the protein encoded by the cloned cDNA was named PLC-δ4 (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the isolated PLC-δ4 cDNA encodes a PLC enzyme, we subcloned the entire coding region of the cDNA into a vaccinia virus vector and expressed the encoded protein in HeLa cells. The expressed PLC-δ4 protein was purified by four successive column chromatographies (Fig. 2). The first chromatographic step, performed with a DEAE-HPLC column, separated PLC-δ4 from several endogenous PLC enzymes; immunoblot analysis with isozyme-specific antibodies revealed that the first activity peak (Fig. 2A) contained PLC-δ1, PLC-δ1, PLC-β1, and PLC-β3 from HeLa cells (data not shown), whereas PLC-δ4 was detected in the second peak. HeLa cells infected with a control vaccinia virus vector not containing the PLC-δ4 cDNA yielded the first activity peak but not the second. The marked retention of PLC-δ4 by the heparin column (third step) facilitated its purification (Fig. 2C). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the peak fractions pooled from the last step on a Mono Q column revealed an apparently homogeneous (>90%) preparation of a 90-kDa protein (Fig. 2D), in good agreement with the calculated molecular mass of PLC-δ4. Because of the low level of expression, only 200 μg of purified PLC-δ4 could be obtained from 20 liters of cultured HeLa cells, despite good recovery yield (overall 25% relative to the DEAE column preparation). In contrast, ~1 mg of purified PLC-δ1 was obtained from 8 liters of cultured HeLa cells that had been transfected with the same virus vector harboring PLC-δ1 cDNA. 2S. B. Lee and S. G. Rhee, unpublished data. The catalytic activities of PLC-δ1 and PLC-δ4 expressed in HeLa cells were measured with [3H]PIP2 at various concentrations of free Ca2+; both enzymes exhibited similar specific activities and dependence on Ca2+ (data not shown). The concentration of PLC-δ4 in most rat tissues is low, and it was not possible to detect the isozyme in crude homogenates by immunoblot analysis. It was thus necessary to prepare samples enriched in PLC-δ4 before such analysis. Tissue homogenates were extracted with 2 M KCl to solubilize PLC isozymes associated with particulate fractions. After dialysis, the extracts were fractionated on a conventional heparin column (mainly to remove turbid material) and then on a heparin HPLC column. Under the experimental conditions described in Fig. 2C, PLC-δ4 bound tightly to the HPLC column and eluted at 62 min, whereas most other isozymes eluted earlier: γ2 at 32 min, γ1 at 37 min, δ1 at 42 min, β1 and β3 at 51 min, β4 at 54 min, δ2 at 66 min, and δ3 at 69 min (data not shown). The resulting PLC-δ4-enriched fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis with affinity-purified monospecific antibodies to PLC-δ4 residues 454-464 (Ab-454) or 759-772 (Ab-759) (Fig. 3). The intensity of the 90-kDa band was strongest with testis and decreased in the order of brain > skeletal muscle > thyroid gland > stomach > thymus > aorta > heart. No band was detected unambiguously with normal or regenerating liver, kidney, prostate, adrenal gland, intestine, pancreas, or lung. In addition to the 90-kDa band, testis showed a strong band of 93 kDa and a weak band of 86 kDa. Only the 86-kDa band was detected in spleen. By comparing the immunoblot intensities of the samples with those of purified PLC-δ4, the amount of PLC-δ4 in various tissues was measured quantitatively. The complex formed between PLC-δ4 and antibodies was visualized with 125I-labeled protein A, and the amount of radioactivity was determined with a PhosphorImager. From the amounts of protein loaded on the two heparin columns and the SDS gel, it was deduced that the amount of PLC-δ4 expressed in nanograms per milligram of protein in the KCl extracts was 7.2 for brain, 20 for testis (combining 90- and 93-kDa forms), 6.4 for skeletal muscle, and 5.6 for thyroid. We also examined the distribution of PLC-δ4 mRNA in rat tissues by RT-PCR with two pairs of PLC-δ4-specific primers. The relative intensities of the expected 230-bp band (Fig. 4A) match qualitatively those of the PLC-δ4 protein band on immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3) when the relative efficiency of PCR amplification is taken into account. In addition to a 230-bp band of weak intensity, the RT-PCR products from testis poly(A)+ RNA contained two larger (330 and 270 bp) bands of stronger intensity. These larger bands were also present in the products from thyroid gland, normal liver, prostate, intestine, and pancreas (Fig. 4A). Cloning and sequencing analysis of the two larger RT-PCR products revealed 96- and 42-nt inserts positioned in-frame between nt 1461 and 1462 of the coding region of PLC-δ4 cDNA (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:B). These insertions add 32 and 14 amino acid residues and would result in putative PLC-δ4 proteins, designated ALT-I and ALT-II, with calculated molecular masses of 92,425 and 90,455 daltons, respectively, if there are no other differences. To determine whether there are any modifications other than the insertions of 96 and 42 bp, we amplified fragments encompassing the entire coding region of PLC-δ4 cDNA by PCR. Two sets of primers based on sequences located in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions were used. The resulting products were then subjected to restriction enzyme digestion with StuI and EcoRI, each of which has only one recognition site in this region and together are expected to generate three fragments of 1493, 597, and 411 bp from the PLC-δ4 cDNA. Three fragments with these expected sizes were observed in the restriction reaction mixtures derived from brain and skeletal muscle poly(A)+ RNA and PLC-δ4 cDNA (Fig. 4C). As predicted for fragments derived from the same molecule, the intensity of the three bands was proportional to their size. However, in the digestion mixture derived from testis poly(A)+ RNA, the 411-bp band was faint, whereas the 1493- and 597-bp bands were strong; two bands of medium intensity were apparent at positions corresponding to 507 and 453 bp, the sizes expected for fragments derived from ALT-I and ALT-II cDNA, respectively (Fig. 4C). This result suggests that ALT-I and ALT-II mRNAs are likely alternatively spliced forms of PLC-δ4 mRNA that differ from the latter only in the 96- and 42-bp inserts. To determine whether the 93-kDa testis protein detected by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3) is a product derived from such alternative splicing, we prepared rabbit antibodies (Ab-ALT-I and Ab-ALT-II, respectively) to the ALT-I-specific sequence KCPMSCLLICVHVLAQA and the ALT-II sequence KKAPNSIPESILL. The PLC-δ4-enriched fractions from brain, skeletal muscle, thyroid gland, and testis were subjected to immunoblot analysis with a mixture of Ab-454 and Ab-759, with Ab-ALT-I, or with Ab-ALT-II (Fig. 5). The 90-kDa band was detected by the mixture of Ab-454 and Ab-759, but not by Ab-ALT-I or Ab-ALT-II, in all four tissues. The 93-kDa band was recognized by all antibodies and detected only in testis, suggesting that this protein corresponds to ALT-I. No band was detected between the 90- and 93-kDa proteins, where the putative ALT-II protein would be expected. These results indicate that ALT-II mRNA is not translated or that the translation product comigrates with ALT-I in the SDS gel. Because the majority (APNSIPESILL) of the sequence against which Ab-ALT-II was prepared is also present in ALT-I, Ab-ALT-II also likely reacts with ALT-I. Therefore, the reactivity of Ab-ALT-II with the 93-kDa band does not necessarily suggest the presence of ALT-II. Our results indicate that PLC-δ4 is expressed at low concentrations in a limited number of rat tissues. The 90-kDa form was unambiguously detected by immuoblot analysis in only 8 of 16 tissues examined, even after enrichment, and the 93-kDa form was detected only in testis. Brain is one of the rat tissues relatively rich in PLC-δ4, but the enzyme concentration of 7.2 ng per milligram of crude extract protein is significantly lower than those of PLC-β1 (70 ng/mg), PLC-γ1 (140 ng/mg), and PLC-δ1 (180 ng/mg). Faint RT-PCR bands derived from PLC-δ4 mRNA were visible in a greater number of tissues, probably because of the greater sensitivity of this procedure. Regenerating liver was examined for PLC-δ4 expression because a PLC-δ-like enzyme that is not recognized by antibodies to either PLC-δ1 or PLC-δ2 was shown to be expressed specifically during rat liver regeneration (14.Asano M. Tamiya-Koizumi K. Homma Y. Takenawa T. Nimura Y. Kojima K. Yoshida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12360-12366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because our immunoblot analysis showed that PLC-δ3 is not the PLC isozyme specific to regenerating liver.2 The present study suggests that PLC-δ4 also is not expressed in regenerating liver. Like the other three δ-type PLCs, PLC-δ4 contains a PH domain sequence at the amino terminus. However, none of the four PLC-δ enzymes is significantly activated by Gβγ subunits.2 The PH domain of PLC-δ1 contains a 14-residue sequence (KVKSSSWRRERFYK) enriched in basic amino acids (net positive charge of 5) that was shown to form the core of the binding site for the negatively charged IP3 and PIP2 and was suggested to tether the enzyme to membrane surfaces containing PIP2(18.Yagisawa H. Hirata M. Kanematsu T. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Sakuma K. Tanaka H. Yabuta N. Kamata H. Hirata H. Nojima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20179-20188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The basic amino acid-rich sequence is well conserved in PLC-δ4 (KVRTKSWKKLRYFR); indeed, the δ4 sequence has a net positive charge of 7 and thus would be predicted to interact better than PLC-δ1 with IP3 and PIP2. Two splice variants of PLC-δ4 mRNA, ALT-I and ALT-II mRNAs, were detected by PCR. ALT-I mRNA encodes the 93-kDa enzyme that contains an additional 32 amino acids located between the X and Y domains of PLC-δ4. It does not appear that ALT-II mRNA, which would produce an enzyme with an additional 14 amino acids in the same region between the X and Y domains, is translated in sufficient quantities to be detected by immunoblot analysis. PLC-δ4 is thus the first example a δ-type PLC that exists in splice variants. Previously identified splice variants correspond to β-type PLC isozymes including rat PLC-β1(19.Bahk Y.Y. Lee Y.H. Lee T.G. Seo J. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8240-8245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bovine PLC-β4(20.Ferreira P.A. Shortridge R.D. Pak W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6042-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), Drosophila PLC-p21(21.Shortridge R.D. Yoon J. Lending C.R. Bloomquist B.T. Perdew M. Pak W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12474-12480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Drosophila PLC-norpA (22.Kim S. McKay R.R. Miller K. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14376-14382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Examination of the splicing differences in these PLC isozymes, including rat PLC-δ4, reveals that all occur outside of the X and Y domains (Fig. 6). Rat PLC-β1 and Drosophila PLC-p21 are alternatively spliced in the carboxyl-terminal region following the Y domain, where the Gααq-binding site is located(12.Lee S.B. Shin S.H. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25952-25957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3704-3709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Splicing differences in Drosophila PLC-norpA variants occur in the PH domain, to which Gβγ subunits and PIP2 might bind. It is thus possible that the differences among splice variants result in differences in the ability to interact with signaling components. Splice variants of rat PLC-δ4, like those of bovine PLC-β4(20.Ferreira P.A. Shortridge R.D. Pak W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6042-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), differ in the region separating the X and Y domains. This separating region of γ-type PLC isozymes plays important roles by interacting with various signaling components through its SH2, SH3, and PH domains. Whether the region linking the X and Y domains of β- and δ-type PLC enzymes also interacts with signaling molecules is not known. However, this region of all mammalian β- and δ-type isozymes is rich in acidic amino acids; 20 of 70, 26 of 76, 29 of 137, and 24 of 100 residues are acidic in β1, β2, β3, and β4 isozymes, respectively, and 11 of 50, 19 of 53, 17 of 44, and 17 of 66 residues are acidic in δ1, δ2, δ3, and δ4 isozymes, respectively. Unlike the other three δ-type PLC isozymes, PLC-δ4 contains a high density (12 of 66 residues) of serine and threonine in the region separating the X and Y domains. All mammalian β-type isoforms with the exception of PLC-β4 also contain a high density of serine and threonine residues in this region. Furthermore, as with other splice variants (22.Kim S. McKay R.R. Miller K. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14376-14382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), PLC-δ4 and ALT-I exhibit distinct tissue distributions. Together, these observations suggest that the 90- and 93-kDa PLC-δ4 enzymes might be regulated differentially."

https://openalex.org/W2032003432,"Treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with recombinant Pasteurella multocida toxin (rPMT), a potent intracellularly acting mitogen, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates including bands of M6 110,000-130,000 and M6 70,000-80,000. Tyrosine phosphorylation induced by rPMT occurred after a pronounced lag period (1 h) and was blocked by either lysosomotrophic agents or incubation at 22°C. Focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) and paxillin are prominent substrates for rPMT-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation.

The increases in p125FAK and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation are accompanied by profound alterations in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and in the assembly of the focal adhesion plaques(31.Seufferlein T.

The effects of rPMT on protein tyrosine phosphorylation, actin stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly were unknown. Here we report that rPMT stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins including p125FAK and paxillin and induces a striking increase in stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly in Swiss 3T3 cells. The mode of action of rPMT differs from that of neuropeptides, growth factors, and extracellular matrix proteins in that the toxin appears to enter the cells to trigger protein tyrosine phosphorylation and cytoskeletal reorganization. Stock cultures of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2and 90% air at 37°C. For experimental purposes, cells were plated either in 30-mm Nunc Petri dishes at 105 cells/dish, or in 90-mm dishes at 6 × 105 cells/dish, in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and used after 6-8 days when the cells were confluent and quiescent(43.Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2936-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells (1-2 × 106) were washed twice with DMEM, treated with rPMT or other factors in 10 ml of DMEM/Waymouth 1:1 (v/v) for the times indicated, and lysed at 4°C in 1 ml of a lysis buffer solution containing 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 100 μM Na3VO4, and 1% Triton X-100. Proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4°C overnight with agarose-linked mAbs directed against phosphotyrosine, paxillin, or p125FAK as indicated. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and extracted for 10 min at 95°C in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 mM Tris/HCl, 6% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Treatment of quiescent cultures of cells with factors, cell lysis, and immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes(44.Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS, pH 7.2, and incubated for 3-5 h at 22°C with a mixture of PY20 and 4G10 anti-Tyr(P) mAbs (1 μg/ml of each). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using 125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG followed by autoradiography. Autoradiograms were scanned using an LKB Ultrascan XL internal integrator. The values expressed represent percentages of the maximum increase in tyrosine phosphorylation above control values. Quiescent and confluent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells in 30-mm dishes were washed twice in phosphate-free DMEM and incubated at 37°C with this medium containing 50 μCi/ml carrier-free [32P]Pi. After 12 h, various factors were added for the indicated times. The cells were subsequently lysed, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with specific anti-80K/MARCKS antibody(45.Erusalimsky J.D. Brooks S.F. Herget T. Morris C. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7073-7080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated for the indicated time in DMEM/Waymouth medium 1:1 (v/v) at 37°C with the indicated concentration of rPMT or other factors. For actin staining, cells were washed once with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 8 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (0.25 μg/ml) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and visualized utilizing a Zeiss Axiophot immunofluorescence microscope. In experiments in which quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were labeled with both TRITC-conjugated phalloidin and anti-vinculin antibody, the cells were fixed and permeabilized as described above and then stained with a mixture of TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (0.25 μg/ml) and anti-vinculin antibody (dilution 1:100) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were subsequently washed three times in PBS and then incubated with FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG as a second antibody at a dilution of 1:100 for another 30 min at room temperature. For C3 exoenzyme microinjection experiments Swiss 3T3 cells were plated in 30-mm dishes at 105 cells/dish in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and used after 6-8 days when the cells were confluent and quiescent. To facilitate localization of microinjected cells, a circle was scored on the bottom of the dishes, and in each experiment approximately 60 adjacent cells in the circle were microinjected. The efficiency of injection was determined by co-injecting rabbit immunoglobulin at 0.5 mg/ml followed by staining of the cells with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Cells were stained with 4G10 mAb directed against phosphotyrosine residues and visualized by confocal microscopy using Cy5-linked anti-mouse IgG. Confocal imaging was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser scanning head fitted to a Nikon Optiphot microscope. A 40× numerical aperture/1.4 planapochromat oil immersion lens (Nikon) was used for all imaging. FITC- and TRITC-conjugated phalloidin fluorochromes were excited at 488 and 568 nm, respectively, using a krypton/argon mixed gas laser (Bio-Rad). Two filter blocks were used, K1 and K2. K1 is a double dichromic filter enabling excitation at the wavelengths of 488 and 568 nm, whereas the K2 filter is a 560-nm dichromic combined with 522-nm green emission and 585-nm red emission filters. Images were collected using the Kalman filter. Care was taken to ensure that the TRITC-conjugated phalloidin channel was sufficiently bright relative to the fluorescein signal to minimize the contribution of bleed-through from the green channel into the red channel (approximately 10%). Correction of images for bleed-through and other processing was carried out using COMOS and SOM programs (Bio-Rad) run on a Compaq Deskpro 66M 486 computer (66 MHz). Data are presented as projections of sequential optical sections. For Z-series, optical sections were recorded at 0.5 μm. Final images were photographed directly from the VDU screen (see Fig. 4, Fig. 6, and Fig. 8).Figure 6:Effect of rPMT and PDGF on the actin cytoskeleton. Quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 were washed with DMEM and incubated in DMEM:Waymouth medium 1:1(v/v) with (B and D) or without (A and C) 20 ng/ml rPMT for 4 h and further incubated for 10 min as follows: A, no addition; B, 20 ng/ml rPMT; C, 30 ng/ml PDGFBB; D, 20 ng/ml rPMT + 30 ng/ml PDGFBB, respectively. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100.

The C3 Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme was a gift from Dr. N. Morii and Professor S. Narumiya, Department of Pharmacology, Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine, Sakyo-ku 606, Japan. To examine the effect of rPMT on tyrosine phosphorylation, quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with 20 ng/ml rPMT for 6 h, conditions known to result in the stimulation of DNA synthesis (5.Rozengurt E. Higgins T. Chanter N. Lax A.J. Staddon J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed, the lysates were incubated with agarose linked anti-Tyr(P) mAb, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with a mixture of PY20 and 4G10 anti-Tyr(P) mAbs. As shown in Fig. 1A, rPMT markedly stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of a group of bands migrating with an apparent M6 of 110,000-130,000 and 70,000-80,000. The ability of rPMT to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins was completely abolished by PMT antiserum in a selective manner (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins induced by rPMT is strikingly similar to that stimulated by bombesin and LPA in Swiss 3T3 cells(27.Zachary I.

To determine whether these cellular proteins were also substrates for rPMT-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, lysates of Swiss 3T3 cells, incubated with 20 ng/ml rPMT for 6 h, were immunoprecipitated with mAbs that recognize either p125FAK or paxillin, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with a mixture of anti-Tyr(P) mAbs. Fig. 1A, shows that rPMT markedly stimulated p125FAKand paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, p125FAK is a component of the broad M6 110,000-130,000 band, whereas paxillin is a component of the diffuse tyrosine-phosphorylated band migrating with an apparent M6 70,000-80,000. Several lines of evidence presented here indicate that rPMT has to enter cells to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins including p125FAKand paxillin. (i) Neuropeptides and LPA elicit maximum tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin within minutes of addition to the cell cultures. In contrast, there is a lag period of 1 h between the addition of 20 ng/ml PMT and a detectable increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins (Fig. 1B). This lag period did not reflect a requirement for de novo protein synthesis as cycloheximide at 25 μM, a concentration that inhibits protein synthesis in Swiss 3T3 cells(47.Lopez-Rivas A. Adelberg E.A. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6275-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), did not prevent the increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation in response to 20 ng/ml rPMT. In addition, we verified that similar amounts of p125FAKwere recovered after different times of treatment with rPMT (results not shown). Interestingly, the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins including p125FAK and paxillin induced by rPMT persisted for at least 24 h (Fig. 1B). (ii) The lysosomotrophic agent methylamine, a membrane-permeant weak base known to inhibit lysosomal processing, completely blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of the M6 110,000-130,000 and M6 70,000-80,000 bands in response to rPMT. The inhibitory effect of methylamine was selective because it did not prevent the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation induced by bombesin in parallel cultures (Fig. 2, A and B). (iii) The entry of many bacterial toxins into the cell cytoplasm is temperature-dependent(48.Smythe E. Pypaert M. Lucocq J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 106: 843-853Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, treatment with 20 ng/ml rPMT for 6 h at 22°C failed to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation in Swiss 3T3 cells. In contrast, bombesin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of M6 110,000-130,000 and M6 70,000-80,000 bands in parallel cultures of these cells incubated at 22°C. (iv) Many bacterial toxins that enter the cells cannot be removed by extensive washing(1.Middlebrook J.C. Dorland R.B. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 199-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2C demonstrates that the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in rPMT-treated cells persisted after removal of the toxin from the extracellular medium. A transient exposure of cells to the toxin for 3-h stimulated maximum tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, the toxin appears to enter the cells via an endosomal/lysosomal pathway where it is processed and then released into the cytosol in an active form. rPMT induces a striking mobilization of Ca2+and stimulation of PKC in Swiss 3T3 cells (16.Staddon J.M.

To determine whether rPMT acts through a PKC-dependent pathway, cells were pretreated for 60 min with the selective PKC inhibitor, GF109203X(50.Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol.

The cells were subsequently challenged with 20 ng/ml rPMT for a further 5 h. rPMT-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK was not significantly reduced (Fig. 3A). In the same experiment, tyrosine phosphorylation induced by 200 nM phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate for 5 h was completely inhibited by GF109203X (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W1548634507,"A method was investigated for monitoring the integrity of oligonucleotides in solution and in cells using fluorescence resonance energy transfer between two different fluorochromes attached to a single oligonucleotide. Ten-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides labeled with fluorescein at one end and with rhodamine X at the other end were used. The oligomer had a specific absorption spectrum with peaks at 497 and 586 nm, which corresponded to fluorescein and rhodamine X, respectively. When excited at 494 nm, the oligomer had a specific fluorescence spectrum with peaks at 523 and 610 nm. The fluorescence intensity at 610 nm was 6-8 times higher than that at 523 nm. After digestion of the oligomer with an endonuclease, the fluorescence at 523 nm increased more than 12-15-fold but its fluorescence peak at 610 nm almost completely disappeared. To examine effects in vivo, sea urchin eggs were injected with a solution of the oligomer and excited with blue light at 470-490 nm. Two fluorescent images, a green image at 520-560 nm and a red image at above 580 nm, were obtained when a single egg was viewed under a fluorescence microscope. The ratio of the intensities of red to green fluorescence decreased in dependence on time after injection of the oligomer. These changes were not observed in eggs that had been injected with a solution of similarly double-labeled, phosphorothioate oligomer. These results indicated that unfertilized sea urchin eggs had nucleolytic activity. Analysis in vitro on supernatant of the egg homogenate indeed demonstrated the existence of nucleases. All together, our results indicate that the integrity of oligonucleotides can be estimated in living cells by monitoring the fluorescence resonance energy transfer of the double-labeled oligonucleotide.

INTRODUCTIONThe injection of oligonucleotides into living cells is an effective method for control of the expression of target genes(1.Erickson R.P. Izant J.G. Gene Regulation: Biology of Antisense RNA and DNA. Raven Press, New York1992Google Scholar, 2.Murray J.A.H. Antisense RNA and DNA. Wiley-Liss, New York1992Google Scholar). Oligodeoxyribonucleotides have been used to analyze the functions of various genes, since such short DNA molecules can inhibit the synthesis of particular proteins in injected cells by binding to the corresponding mRNA that includes the complementary sequence(3.Wagner R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 4.Woolf T.M. Melton D.A. Jennings C.G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Introduction of a functional gene with transposable elements into target cells would allow us to produce functionally important cell lines(5.Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar). The fate of single-stranded oligonucleotides in vivo has been monitored by use of materials labeled with a fluorescent dye at one end(6.Leonetti J.P. Mechti N. Degols G. Gagnor C. Lebleu B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2702-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In the search for a treatment for AIDS, ribozymes or their artificially modified analogues appear to be good candidates for drugs of the future since specially designed ribozymes can specifically cleave the mRNA of the AIDS virus(7.Sarver N.

In studies of such possible therapeutic modalities, the structural integrity of oligonucleotides merits careful consideration because of the dependence of specific binding activity on the length of the oligonucleotide sequence. There is always the undesirable possibility of depolymerization or cleavage by digestion by intracellular nucleases. Ribozymes are especially sensitive to intracellular ribonucleases because their active sites are composed of RNA(14.Shimayama T. Nishikawa F. Nishikawa S. Taira K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2605-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). If we are to monitor the fate of ribozyme in vivo by use of conventional materials labeled with a fluorescent dye at one end, we are likely to detect degraded RNAs labeled with a fluorescent dye at their end. To address these issues, we investigated methods for estimating the integrity of injected oligonucleotides and detecting the nucleolytic activity in living cells using oligonucleotides that had been double-labeled with two fluorescent dyes. We examined the fluorescence characteristics of and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 1The abbreviations used are: FRETfluorescence resonance energy transferHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. within these double-labeled oligonucleotides.FRET is an interesting example of a fluorescence-related phenomenon (15.Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar, 16.Herman B. Taylor D.L. Wang Y. Fluorescence Microscopy of Living Cells in Culture, Part B. Academic Press, New York1989: 220-245Google Scholar). When the fluorescence spectrum of one fluorochromes, the donor, overlaps with the excitation spectrum of another fluorochrome, the acceptor, and when the donor and the acceptor are in close physical proximity, the excitation of the donor induces the emission of fluorescence from the acceptor as if the acceptor has been excited directly and the intensity of fluorescence from the donor decreases. The extent of FRET is extremely sensitive to the distance between the donor and the acceptor, being inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance. This phenomenon can be explored for studies of intermolecular and intramolecular relationships in biophysical investigations and in cell biology and has been used, for example, to examine the structure in solution of a hammerhead ribozyme(17.Tuschl T.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).To investigate the integrity of oligonucleotides and the detection of nucleolytic activity in living cells, we used fluorescently double-labeled, single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides. FRET was demonstrated spectroscopically in solutions of the modified oligonucleotides and was visualized under the fluorescence microscope in sea urchin eggs after microinjection of the modified oligonucleotides. Enzymatic digestion eliminated the efficiency of FRET both in solutions and in eggs. These results indicate that it is possible to detect only the intact oligonucleotides in living cells by monitoring FRET. We also found nucleolytic activity in living, unfertilized sea urchin eggs by measuring the time-dependent decrease of efficiency of the FRET.MATERIALS AND METHODSDouble-labeled OligodeoxyribonucleotidesDouble-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized chemically or with the aid of an enzyme. For enzymatic synthesis, fluorescein 12-dideoxyuridine-5′-triphosphate was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany). A 9-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide conjugated with rhodamine X at its 5′-end (R-ODN) was purchased from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan). The sequence of the oligonucleotide was 5′-TGAAATTGT-3′. To synthesize the 10-mer oligonucleotide (R-ODN-F) with fluorescein and rhodamine X at its 3′ and 5′ ends, respectively, 0.1 mM fluorescein 12-dideoxyuridine-5′-triphosphate and 0.05 mM R-ODN were incubated with 20 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 h at 37°C in a solution that contained 100 mM potassium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2), 2 mM CoCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol(25.Trainor G.L. Jensen M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11846Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The product, R-ODN-F, was purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Tosoh model 8100; Tokyo, Japan) with an ion-exchange column (TSK gel DEAE-5PW; Tosoh). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.1 to 1 M) in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at room temperature(26.Kato Y. Kitamura T. Mitsui A. Yamasaki Y. Hashimoto T. Murotsu T. Fukushige S. Matsubara K. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 447: 212-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Alternatively, we also used a chemically synthesized 10-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide (5′-TGAAATTGTT-3′) that was double-labeled with fluorescein at its 5′-end and rhodamine X at its 3′-end, respectively (F-ODN-R) and we also used another chemically synthesized 10-mer phosphorothioate oligodeoxyribonucleotide (5′-TGAAATTGTT-3′) that was double-labeled with rhodamine X at its 5′-end and fluorescein at its 3′-end, respectively (R-S-ODN-F). F-ODN-R was supplied by Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan) and R-S-ODN-F was supplied by Bex (Tokyo, Japan). The purity of F-ODN-R was confirmed by HPLC under the conditions described above. These fluorescent oligomers were confirmed to have the same spectrometric characteristics as the enzymatically synthesized oligomer.Absorption and Fluorescence SpectroscopyThe oligonucleotides were diluted to a solution (Medium A) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, and 1 mM MgCl2 to concentrations appropriate for absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy(27.Takahashi M. Ling C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were recorded with a spectrophotometer (Hitachi model 557; Hitachi City, Japan) and the fluorescence spectra were recorded with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (model 850; Hitachi).Enzymatic Digestion of OligonucleotidesOligonucleotides with regular phosphodiester linkages were digested with Bal-31 nuclease (Takara Shuzo) which functions as an endonuclease when presented with single-stranded DNA as substrate(28.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Phosphorothioate oligonucleotide was digested with nuclease P1 (Boehringer Mannheim) which functions as a nuclease against phosphorothioate oligonucleotides with SP configuration(29.Potter B.V.L. Connolly B.A. Eckstein F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1369-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For measurements in vitro, F-ODN-R (34 pmol) was incubated with Bal-31 (5 units) in 2 ml of medium A for 60 min at 30°C; R-ODN-F (67 pmol) was incubated with Bal-31 (2 units) in reaction buffer solution (25 μl) containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 600 mM NaCl, 12 mM CaCl2, 12 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA for 60 min at 30°C and then resuspended in 2 ml of medium A; and R-S-ODN-F (240 pmol) was incubated with nuclease P1 (1.6 units) in reaction buffer solution (20 μl) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA for 60 min at 30°C and then resuspended in 2 ml of medium A. For measurement in vivo, F-ODN-R (200 pmol) was incubated with Bal-31 (0.1 unit) in medium A (4 μl) for 30 min at 30°C. Digestion was stopped by addition of 2 μl of 0.1 M EGTA to 4 μl of the reaction mixture.Sea Urchin Eggs and MicroinjectionEggs of the sea urchin Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus were collected by intracoelomic injection of 0.55 M KCl. They were washed twice with seawater. Eggs were set on a poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslip to which a Lucite frame had been attached to produce a chamber with a volume of about 3 ml. Oligonucleotides were suspended at a concentration of 67-240 μM in 100 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2) or in distilled water. The solution of oligonucleotides (about 1-2% of the eggs volume) was microinjected into eggs by the method described elsewhere(30.Hirano K. Dev. Growth & Differ. 1982; 24: 273-281Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar).Microscopic Visualization of FRETTo investigate the FRET from eggs that had been injected with oligonucleotides, the components of the fluorescence were separated with two types of filter attached to the fluorescence microscope (Diaphoto-TMD; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Green images were observed through a band-pass filter at 520-560 nm, and red images were observed through a sharp cutoff filter at wavelengths above 580 nm. For both types of imaging, infrared light was eliminated with a heat-absorbing filter. The excitation light, obtained at 470-490 nm by passage through a band-pass filter, was removed from the fluorescence signal by a dichroic mirror with a cut-off wavelengths of 510 nm. All filters and the mirror were purchased from Nikon. To decrease the extent of photo-bleaching of dyes by strong excitation light, we used a 100-watt halogen lamp at 6 volts that was regulated by a stabilizing DC power supply (NP-1500z; Nissyo Industry, Japan). The green and red components of the fluorescent images were accumulated alternatively for 5 s with a high-sensitivity ICCD camera (c2400-80; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu city, Japan), and the fluorescence intensity was analyzed with an image processor (ARGUS-50; Hamamatsu Photonics).Detection in Vitro of Nuclease Activities in Sea Urchin EggsSea urchin eggs were washed three times with Ca2+-free seawater. After hand centrifugation, eggs (150 μl) were suspended in 850 μl of a solution containing 20 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 6.8), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl2, and then homogenized 10 times with a Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 11,000 × g at 4°C (MR-150; TOMY SEIKO, Tokyo, Japan) for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was used for measurements for nucleolytic activity. For digestive reaction, 1 μl of R-ODN (100 pmol) was incubated with 50 μl of the supernatant at 30°C for 60 min. Absorbance at 260 nm of the supernatant in 1/100 dilution was 0.38. Digestive reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of 500 mM EDTA to the reaction mixture (51 μl). Digestive products of the reaction were detected at fluorescence of rhodamine X, monitored at 610 nm upon excitation at 585 nm by means of a HPLC equipped with ion-exchange column. The analytical condition of HPLC was the same as described above (in the section for the identification of oligos).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDouble-labeled Oligonucleotide with Two Fluorescent DyesThe integrity of oligonucleotides is important for their function when they are injected into cells to regulate transcription or translation. Since the conventional fluorescent single-end-labeling method cannot be used to monitor the fate of nuclease-sensitive oligomers, we investigated methods for estimating the integrity of injected oligonucleotides in living cells using, at first, an oligonucleotide that had been double-labeled with two fluorescent dyes. The fluorescence characteristics of and the FRET within these double-labeled oligonucleotides were examined in vitro and in vivo. Since the purity of the double-labeled oligonucleotide was important for measurements of FRET in solution and in cells, we analyzed the components of the synthesized oligomer by HPLC. As shown in Fig. 1, only one peak was observed in the chromatogram of F-ODN-R after chromatography on an ion-exchange column when absorption of the eluent was monitored at 260 nm. A single peak also appeared in the elution profile after HPLC when fluorescence was monitored at 606 nm with excitation at 494 nm. The presence of the single peak in each case demonstrated that the synthesized product consisted exclusively of a 10-mer oligonucleotide, the two ends of which were separately labeled with fluorescein and rhodamine X.FRET in VitroThe spectroscopic characteristics of F-ODN-R were analyzed to determine the appropriate conditions for measurements of FRET. The absorption spectrum recorded with a spectrophotometer had peaks at 497 and 586 nm (Fig. 2), indicating that the solution included fluorescein and rhodamine X. The fluorescence spectrum of the F-ODN-R was also recorded and peaks at 523 and 610 nm were found upon excitation at 494 nm (Fig. 3A). These wavelengths correspond to the peaks of fluorescence emitted by fluorescein and rhodamine X, respectively. The fluorescence intensity at 610 nm was 8 times higher than that at 523 nm. The excitation spectrum, detected at 606 nm, is shown in Fig. 3B. Two peaks can be seen which correspond to fluorescein and rhodamine X, respectively. These spectra indicate that considerable energy from the excited fluorescein fluorochrome was transferred to rhodamine X.Figure 2:Absorption spectrum of F-ODN-R in medium A.

A, emission spectrum of a solution of F-ODN-R, upon excitation at 494 nm (band-pass, 5 nm). This spectrum has peaks at 523 and 610 nm. The peak at 523 nm corresponds to the fluorescence of fluorescein, and the peak at 610 nm corresponds to that of rhodamine X. B, excitation spectrum of a solution of F-ODN-R, monitored at 606 nm (band-pass 5 nm). This spectrum has peaks at 500 and 594 nm. The peak at 500 nm corresponds to the absorbance of fluorescein, and the peak at 594 nm corresponds to that of rhodamine X. The fluorescence spectra of F-ODN-R in medium A indicate that FRET occurred in the solution of F-ODN-R.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the observed FRET occurred between the dyes attached to one and the same molecule of the oligonucleotide, we digested the oligonucleotide with Bal-31, which functions as an endonuclease against single-stranded DNA. After incubation with the enzyme, the digested material was analyzed spectroscopically. The fluorescence intensity at 523 nm was 15 times higher than that before endonucleolytic digestion (Fig. 4). The peak of red fluorescence at 610 nm disappeared. These results indicate that FRET of the intact oligomer could be ascribed to the relationship between intramolecular fluorochromes. Therefore, it appeared that the integrity of the oligonucleotide could be recognized from the changes in the fluorescence intensity of the donor and the acceptor fluorochromes, and that it should be possible to infer, from in vivo measurements of FRET, the degree of integrity of double-labeled fluorescent oligonucleotides.Figure 4:Fluorescence spectrum of products of the reaction with endonuclease (Bal-31) in medium A (solid line). The digested F-ODN-R had a peak of fluorescence at 523 nm that corresponded to fluorescein. The intensity of fluorescence was 15 times higher than that before endonucleolytic treatment. The peak of red fluorescence at 610 nm corresponding to rhodamine X has disappeared. These results indicate that the FRET of F-ODN-R was due to the relationship between intramolecular fluorochromes. Spectrum indicated by the dotted line is a spectrum of a solution of F-ODN-R before treatment with Bal-31 (same spectrum as shown in Fig. 3A).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FRET in VivoTo examine the possibility of visualization of FRET in cells, F-ODN-R was microinjected into unfertilized sea urchin eggs. These eggs were illuminated with blue light at 470-490 nm to photoexcite the fluorescein fluorochrome of the F-ODN-R. The green and red components of the emitted fluorescence were separately monitored with a fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate sets of filters. The results are shown in Fig. 5. The eggs injected with the intact F-ODN-R emitted bright red light in addition to the green light from fluorescein (Fig. 5, A and B). By contrast, no red fluorescence was emitted from eggs that had been injected with the previously Bal-31-digested oligonucleotide (Fig. 5E); only green fluorescence was emitted (Fig. 5D). Similarly, only green fluorescence was emitted from eggs that had been injected with a solution of mixture of a fluoresceinated mononucleotide and a rhodamine X-labeled 9-mer oligonucleotide (data not shown). These results are consistent with the results of the experiments in vitro with the fluorescence spectrophotometer.Figure 5:Fluorescence microscopy of the sea urchin eggs that had been microinjected with the double-labeled fluorescent oligonucleotide F-ODN-R. Unfertilized eggs were injected with the intact oligomer (A, B, and F) or with the enzymatically digested oligomer (D and E). The paired images of fluorescent components in the green-light region (A and D) and the red region (B and E) were recorded separately from the same eggs. The ratio image (C) of red to green was computed from the fluorescent components in photographs A and B. These photographs are shown in pseudo colors. Photograph F shows the transmitted-light image of the egg. Bar equals 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The intensity of fluorescence varied among different regions of the egg. The middle region of the egg was intensely fluorescent and the intensity of fluorescence decreased from the center to the periphery in both red- and green-light images. The absence of uniformity can be ascribed to the length of the light path within the spherical sea urchin egg. The ratio intensities of the two qualitatively different images could be used to eliminate the effect of cell volume, as in the case of calculations of intracellular concentrations of calcium ions using the fluorescent dyes Fura-2 (31.Williams D.A. Fogarty K.E. Tsien R.Y. Fay F.S. Nature. 1985; 318: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and Indo-1(32.Grynkiewicz G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We “divided” the red image by the green image with an image processor and the result is shown in Fig. 5C. The new image shows the uniformity of FRET within the cytoplasm of an egg injected with F-ODN-R. The cytoplasmic margin of the egg surface, namely, the egg cortex, gave a higher value for the ratio than the inner cytoplasm. This higher ratio might be the result of the higher viscosity in the narrow cortex region as compared with the inner region(33.Hiramoto Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1974; 89: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Such a difference causes the disparity in the refraction between green and red light at the surface, giving rise to an error in the estimation of FRET. While we were unable to clarify the discontinuity in the extent of FRET at the cortex, the ratio of the images demonstrates that the double-labeled fluorescent oligonucleotide exhibited uniform FRET throughout the cytoplasm of the living egg.Time-dependent Decrease of FRET in Living EggsThe FRET in the egg was different from that measured in solution by fluorescence spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 5(A and B), the fluorescence intensity of the green component was nearly identical to that of the red component, whereas the ratio of the intensity at 610 nm to that at 523 nm in solution was 6.72 (Table 1). The marked discrepancy between these two ratios might be caused by the imaging instrumentation of the microscope and the video camera, in particular since the camera was sensitive to wavelength. The camera used here was about 1.5 times more sensitive to light at 520 nm than at 600 nm. To confirm this possibility, we observed the solution of the double-labeled oligo's enclosed by liquid paraffin in a glass capillary, using the same microscope-video camera system under the same conditions as for the accumulation of image of fluorescence from the egg. The image analysis of this sample yielded a ratio of red to green fluorescence of 6.1. This value for the solution in the capillary was of the same order as that for the same sample measured with the fluorescence spectrophotometer and was entirely different from the FRET in the egg. The results suggest that the discrepancy in the extent of FRET between the egg and the solution might be due mainly to the condition of the F-ODN-R molecule in the intracellular environment and not to the detection system.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The elimination of FRET after cleavage of the oligonucleotide was demonstrated by injection of F-ODN-R that had been pretreated with endonuclease (Fig. 5, D and E). If the sea urchin egg contains nucleases, the injected double-labeled oligomer should be degraded and the extent of FRET should decrease with the time after the injection. Therefore, we measured time-dependent changes in the fluorescence ratio of the red to the green component from a single living egg under the microscope (Fig. 6A). When the oligonucleotide was injected, FRET rapidly decreased and reached plateau in about 1 h. The ratio decreased from 2.3 at 1 min to 0.42 at 60 min. This time-dependent decrease of FRET was not observed in the eggs injected with double-labeled phosphorothioate, R-S-ODN-F, which is known to be resistant to the digestion by general nucleases. This modified R-S-ODN-F had the same FRET property as that of the oligomer with regular phosphodiester linkages (Table 1): note that the fluorescence ratio of R-S-ODN-F decreased by the treatment with nuclease P1, a nucleolytic enzyme that can digest phosphorothioate linkages with SP configuration(29.Potter B.V.L. Connolly B.A. Eckstein F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1369-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The incubation of the eggs injected with phosphorothioate R-S-ODN-F for 60 min showed no change"
https://openalex.org/W1966210234,"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of various types of cells including glomerular mesangial cells. The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is one of the main signal transduction systems leading to cell proliferation. MAPK is tightly regulated by the activating kinase, MEK, and specific phosphatase MKP-1. Constitutive expression of MKP-1 has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation by suppressing MAPK activity. In order to understand the mechanism of the anti-proliferative effect of ANP, we examined whether ANP could inhibit MAPK by inducing MKP-1 in cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells. ANP increased the expression of MKP-1 mRNA in a dose-dependent (10 nM maximum) and time-dependent, with a peak stimulation at 30 min, manner. Receptor for ANP is a transmembrane guanylyl cyclase. Activation of guanylyl cyclase of ANP receptor by ligand plays an essential role in ANP signal transduction. 8-Bromo-cGMP, a cell permeable analogue of cyclic GMP, and sodium nitroprusside, an activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase, could mimic the effects of ANP and were able to induce the expression of MKP-1 in a similar time course as ANP. The protein expression of MKP-1 was maximally stimulated by ANP at 120 min. Treatment of the cells with ANP for 120 min resulted in an inhibition of phorbol ester-induced activation of MAPK, while the activation of MEK was not affected by ANP. These results indicate that ANP might inhibit the proliferation of mesangial cells by inactivating MAPK through the induction of MKP-1.

The recent report suggests that the constitutive expression of MKP-1 also inhibits Jun kinase activity (25.Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that the anti-proliferative action of ANP might be mediated by the induction of MKP-1. To prove this hypothesis, we examined the effect of ANP on the expression of MKP-1 and the activation of MAPK in cultured mesangial cells. We report here that ANP induces the expression of MKP-1 mRNA and protein and inhibits the activation of MAPK cascade at the level of MAPK in cultured glomerular mesangial cells in concentrations enough to inhibit the proliferation of mesangial cells(5.Haneda M. Kikkawa R. Koya D. Sakamoto K. Nakanishi S. Matsuda Y. Shigeta Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These data could provide a new mechanism of anti-proliferative effect of ANP. Rat ANP1-28 was obtained from Peptide Institute (Suita, Japan). Rat des-[Gln18-Ser19-Gly20-Leu21-Gly22]ANP 4-23-NH2 (C-ANP), phorbol 12-13-dibutyrate (PDBu), bovine myelin basic protein (MBP), 8-bromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. Anti-ERK2 and anti-MKP-1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Recombinant GST-MAPK (p44Mapk), GST-HVH-1, and anti-MEK antisera were prepared as described previously(18.Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 15335-15341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Paul Killen, University of Michigan. All other reagents were of chemical grade and purchased from standard suppliers. Glomerular mesangial cells were obtained from a culture of glomeruli, isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 100-150 g by sieving method, in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics as described previously(30.Kikkawa R. Umemura K. Haneda M. Arimura T. Ebata K. Shigeta Y. Diabetes. 1987; 36: 240-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells at passage 2 to 9 were grown until 80% confluency in 100-mm dishes and then made quiescent by reducing the concentrations of FBS to 0.4% for 72 h. For experiments, the quiescent cells were incubated in an incubation medium (RPMI 1640 medium with 0.4% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) at 37°C for 30 min. The cells were then exposed to various agents in the incubation medium at 37°C for indicated time interval. The reactions were stopped by rapid aspiration of the medium and by washing twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were used for Northern blot analysis, immunoblot analysis, and immunoprecipitation as follows. Ten μg of total RNA extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was electrophoresed through a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel and transferred on nylon filter (Nytran, Schleicher and Schuell). The filter was prehybridized in Church buffer (500 mM NaPO4, pH 7.0, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mM EDTA) at 65°C for 2 h and hybridized with 1 × 106 cpm/ml radiolabeled HVH1 cDNA (18.Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16116-16119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 65°C for 24 h in a rotating hybridization oven. The filter was washed twice with wash buffer A (40 mM NaPO4, pH 7.0, 5% SDS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 mM EDTA) for 10 min at 65°C, twice with wash buffer B (40 mM NaPO4, pH 7.0, 1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA) in the same conditions, and exposed to Kodak X-AR film with intensifying screen at −70°C. The intensity of the bands was quantified by a densitometric analysis and signals were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signals. The cells were harvested in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 25 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 25 mM β-glycerophosphate) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants containing 100 μg of protein were subjected to 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore). The membranes were probed with anti-MKP-1 antibody (diluted at 1:1000). A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000) was used to allow detection of immunoreactive bands using enhanced chemiluminescence (DuPont NEN). The cell lysate (about 400 μg of protein) was incubated with 5 μl of anti-MEK antisera or 1 μg of anti-ERK2 antibody for 2 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were recovered by incubating with protein G-Sepharose (20 μl, Pharmacia) for 1 h at 4°C, centrifuging, and washing three times with cell lysis buffer and once with a kinase buffer (18 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM magnesium acetate, and 50 μM ATP) without ATP. The activities of MAPK or MEK were determined by MBP kinase assay as described previously(26.Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23933-23939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19947-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Zheng C.F.

The immunoprecipitates with anti-ERK2 antibody were incubated with 20 μg of MBP in 40 μl of a kinase buffer containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 30°C. The immunoprecipitates with anti-MEK antisera were incubated first with 2 μg of GST-MAPK in a kinase buffer at 30°C for 15 min and then with 2 μCi of [γ-[32P]ATP and 20 μg of MBP at 30°C for an additional 10 min. Results were expressed as mean ± S.D. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with subsequent Scheffe's test was used to determine significant differences in multiple comparisons. We first examined whether MKP-1 mRNA could be induced in mesangial cells by the stimuli known to be effective in other types of cells. As shown in Fig. 1, fetal bovine serum (2.5%) and PDBu (100 nM) were able to rapidly induce MKP-1 mRNA when examined by Northern blot analysis using HVH-1 cDNA, a human homologue of 3CH134, as a probe. We next examined the effect of ANP on the expression of MKP-1 in cultured mesangial cells. As shown in Fig. 2, ANP (100 nM) increased the expression of MKP-1 mRNA rapidly and the maximal induction was obtained at 30 min. ANP-induced expression of MKP-1 mRNA was observed in a concentration-dependent manner of ANP with a maximal response at 10-100 nM (Fig. 3), concentrations enough to inhibit the proliferation of mesangial cells(5.Haneda M.

Sakamoto K. Nakanishi S. Matsuda Y. Shigeta Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In order to know the mechanism of ANP-induced expression of MKP-1 mRNA, we examined the effect of cGMP on MKP-1 mRNA expression in mesangial cells. When the mesangial cells were incubated with 8-Br-cGMP, a cell permeable analogue of cGMP, MKP-1 mRNA expression was increased in a similar time course as ANP (Fig. 4A). However, C-ANP, an analogue specific to clearance receptors for ANP(5.Haneda M. Kikkawa R. Koya D. Sakamoto K. Nakanishi S. Matsuda Y. Shigeta Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), failed to induce MKP-1 mRNA expression (data not shown). SNP, an activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase, was also able to induce the expression of MKP-1 mRNA (Fig. 4B). The expression of MKP-1 protein was next examined by an immunoblot analysis. The 39-kDa protein, the same molecular mass protein as MKP-1 reported in PC12 cells(23.Misra-Press A. Rim C.S. Yao H. Roberson M.S. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14587-14596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), was detected from rat mesangial cell lysate. This protein could not be detected when the antibody was preincubated with recombinant MKP-1, GST-HVH-1 (data not shown). As shown Fig. 5, ANP (100 nM) induced the expression of MKP-1 protein with a maximal stimulation at 120 min. ANP also induced the expression of the protein with 42-44 kDa molecular mass. This protein might be MKP-2 reported in PC12 cells (23.Misra-Press A. Rim C.S. Yao H. Roberson M.S. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14587-14596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of ANP on the activities of MAPK and MEK. The mesangial cells were treated with 100 nM ANP for 120 min prior to stimulation with PDBu for 10 min and then the activities of MAPK and MEK were measured. PDBu rapidly increased MAPK and MEK (10 min maximum) in a concentration-dependent manner (10-100 nM maximum) in rat mesangial cells (data not shown). PDBu-induced activation of MAPK was significantly inhibited in cells treated with ANP for 120 min, while basal activities of MAPK remained unchanged (Fig. 6A). In contrast, PDBu-induced activation of MEK was not affected by ANP (Fig. 6B), indicating that PDBu-induced activation of MAPK cascade was blocked by ANP at the level of MAPK. ANP, a potent vasorelaxing peptide, is able to inhibit the proliferation of glomerular mesangial cells by cGMP-dependent mechanism(5.Haneda M. Kikkawa R. Koya D. Sakamoto K. Nakanishi S. Matsuda Y. Shigeta Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The present study was performed to clarify the mechanism of anti-proliferative action of ANP and the results indicate that ANP is able to induce the expression of MAPK phosphatase, MKP-1, by cGMP-dependent mechanism in concentrations enough to inhibit the proliferation of mesangial cells. Furthermore, PDBu-induced activation of MAPK cascade was inhibited by ANP at the level of MAPK. MKP-1 (also called as 3CH134, CL100, erp, or HVH1) is a dual specificity phosphatase that selectively dephosphorylates MAPK in vitro(15.Charles C.H. Sun H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In mesangial cells, MKP-1 mRNA was induced by fetal bovine serum or phorbol ester, the agents known to activate MAPK(10.Sugimoto T. Kikkawa R. Haneda M. Shigeta Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11.Wang Y. Simonson M.S. Pousségur J. Dunn M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The induction of MKP-1 by these growth-promoting agents may be responsible for the down-regulation of MAPK after growth stimuli as suggested by Sun et al.(16.Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that ANP, which could not activate MAPK(10.Sugimoto T. Kikkawa R. Haneda M. Shigeta Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), rapidly increased the expression of MKP-1 mRNA and MKP-1 protein in cultured mesangial cells. This is the first report that the anti-proliferative agent could induce MKP-1 gene expression. ANP-induced expression of MKP-1 might be mediated by cGMP-dependent pathway, because 8-Br-cGMP and SNP were also able to induce the expression of MKP-1, while C-ANP, an analogue specific to clearance receptors of ANP, was without effect. It has been reported that MKP-1 mRNA expression is induced by the activation of protein kinase C or cAMP-dependent kinase (protein kinase A) cascade(19.Noguchi T. Metz R. Chen L. Mattei M-G. Carrasco D. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The activation of protein kinase C or cAMP-dependent kinase (protein kinase A) has been shown to activate transcription factor(s) which bind to the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate responsive element or to cAMP responsive element. However, little information is available on how the cGMP-dependent signal transduction may influence gene expression. Recently, nitric oxide-releasing agents and the membrane permeable analogue of cGMP have been reported to activate transcription from AP-1 responsive promoters in rodent fibroblast and epithelial cell line(32.Pilz R. Suhanishi M. Idriss S. Meinkoth J.L. Boss G.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Since the human MKP-1 gene (CL100) contains one AP-1 site in the region upstream of the transcription start site (33.Kwak S.P. Hakes D.J. Martell K.J. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3596-3604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesize that ANP may induce the expression of the MKP-1 gene through the activation of this AP-1 site. Constitutive expression of MKP-1 has been shown to attenuate serum- or oncogenic ras-induced MAPK activation(16.Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 22.Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), to block MAPK-dependent gene expression(23.Misra-Press A. Rim C.S. Yao H. Roberson M.S. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22.Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), suggesting that the inactivation of MAPK in vivo by MKP-1 has a negative effect on cell proliferation. In the present study, when MKP-1 protein was maximally induced by exposing the cells to ANP for 120 min, phorbol ester-induced activation of MAPK was inhibited, while the activation of MEK was not affected, indicating that MAPK cascade was blocked by ANP at the level of MAPK. These date indicate that ANP may negatively regulate MAPK through the induction of MKP-1, leading to the inhibition of the proliferation of mesangial cells. We have previously reported that phorbol ester-induced activation of MAPK was inhibited by ANP in cultured mesangial cells when the cells were treated with ANP for only 10 min(10.Sugimoto T. Kikkawa R. Haneda M. Shigeta Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Ten-min incubation periods might not be enough for ANP to induce the expression of MKP-1 protein and ANP has been shown to directly suppress phorbol ester-induced activation of protein kinase C in mesangial cells(34.Studer R.K. Craven P.A. DeRubertis F.R. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 1074-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, ANP is able to attenuate phorbol ester-induced activation of MAPK through two independent mechanisms; one might be the inhibition at a step proximal to MAPK as a short term effect and the other is due to the induction of MKP-1 expression as a relatively long term effect shown in the present study. Thus, MKP-1 induction by ANP shown in the present study might provide a new mechanism of anti-proliferative action of ANP in glomerular mesangial cells."

Gene products of sdhC and sdhD are small hydrophobic subunits that anchor the hydrophilic catalytic subunits (flavoprotein and iron-sulfur protein) to the cytoplasmic membrane and are believed to be the components of cytochrome b556 in E. coli complex II. In the present study, to elucidate the role of two hydrophobic subunits in the heme b ligation and functional assembly of complex II, plasmids carrying portions of the sdh gene were constructed and introduced into E. coli MK3, which lacks succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase activities. The expression of polypeptides with molecular masses of about 19 and 17 kDa was observed when sdhC and sdhD were introduced into MK3, respectively, indicating that sdhC encodes the large subunit (cybL) and sdhD the small subunit (cybS) of cytochrome b556. An increase in cytochrome b content was found in the membrane when sdhD was introduced, while the cytochrome b content did not change when sdhC was introduced. However, the cytochrome b expressed by the plasmid carrying sdhD differed from cytochrome b556 in its CO reactivity and red shift of the α absorption peak to 557.5 nm at 77 K. Neither hydrophobic subunit was able to bind the catalytic portion to the membrane, and only succinate dehydrogenase activity, not succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity, was found in the cytoplasmic fractions of the cells. In contrast, significantly higher amounts of cytochrome b556 were expressed in the membrane when sdhC and sdhD genes were both present, and the catalytic portion was found to be localized in the membrane with succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase and succinate oxidase activities. These results strongly suggest that both hydrophobic subunits are required for heme insertion into cytochrome b556 and are essential for the functional assembly of E. coli complex II in the membrane.

The precise regulation of cell-cell interactions is an essential feature of the development and function of the mammary gland. Three differentiated cell types, stromal, myoepithelial, and epithelial cells, exist in the mammary epithelium and/or mesenchyme, and reciprocal communication between these cell types occurs as part of mammary morphogenesis during postnatal development and puberty, as well as during pregnancy and lactation(1.Daniel C.W.

Moreover, ZO-1 is a member of a family of membrane-associated proteins containing potential SH3 and guanylate kinase domains, the first of which is the lethal(1)discs-large-1 (dlg) tumor suppressor gene located at the septate junction in Drosophila(30.Willott E.

This homology implicates ZO-1 as a potential component of signal transduction cascades through the plasma membrane(31.Tsukita S. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Conceivably, the availability and combinatorial actions of systemic steroids and locally acting growth factors, which regulate particular stages of mammary gland growth and differentiation, concomitantly control tight junction dynamics. In vivo studies suggest that one or more of the lactogenic hormones, such as prolactin, insulin, and/or glucocorticoids(32.Oka T. Perry J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3586-3591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Haslam S.Z. Nevill M.C. Daniel C.W. The Mammary Gland Development, Regulation, and Function. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1987: 499-533Google Scholar), may play an important role in establishing and regulating appropriate intercellular contacts. Our recent in vitro studies using cultured 31EG4 mouse mammary epithelial cells demonstrated that glucocorticoids but not the other lactogenic hormones stimulated an increase in monolayer transepithelial electrical resistance and a decrease in the paracellular permeability (10.Zettl K.S. Sjaastad M.D. Riskin P.M. Parry G. Machen T.E. Firestone G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9069-9073Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), implicating this steroid as a key regulator of mammary tight junctions. The glucocorticoid-dependent stimulation of 31EG4 tight junctions occurs by a receptor-dependent process requiring normal levels of extracellular calcium (10.Zettl K.S. Sjaastad M.D. Riskin P.M. Parry G. Machen T.E. Firestone G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16108-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of other classes of extracellular signals on tight junction dynamics is unknown, and perhaps other mammogenic factors may concurrently modulate tight junction function and/or structure. One candidate mammogenic factor is transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-βtransforming growth factor-β 1TERtransepithelial electrical resistancePBSphosphate-buffered salineCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseDexdexamethasone. which is produced within morphologically distinct areas of the mammary gland (34.Robinson S.D.

In appropriate experiments, dexamethasone was added to a final concentration of 1 μM, and TGF-β was added to a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. In order to inhibit DNA synthesis, cell cultures were exposed to 1 mM hydroxyurea. TER was measured on filter grown cells using the EVOM Epithelial Voltohmmeter (World Precision Instruments) as described previously(8.Buse P. Woo P.L. Alexander D.B. Cha H.H. Reza A. Sirota N.D.

The EVOM provides an alternating square wave current of ± 20 μA through the monolayer to measure the tightness of the tight junction. Daily resistance measurements were taken at room temperature with the electrode after alcohol sterilization. Calculations for ohms•cm2 were made by subtracting a blank filter (159 Ω) and multiplying by the area of the monolayer (0.49 cm2). DNA synthesis was quantitated by determining the incorporation of [3H]thymidine. Triplicate samples of cells grown on permeable filter supports under the indicated hormonal conditions were incubated with 6 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine (82.9 Ci/mmol) for 2 h at 37°C in a humid atmosphere of air/CO2 (95:5). The cells were washed three times with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the filters were placed directly into scintillation vials with 300 μl of 0.3 N NaOH to lyse the cells. Radioactivity was quantified on a Beckman LS 1801 liquid scintillation counter. 31EG4 mammary cells were plated at 100% confluency on 24-well filters and incubated with the indicated combinations and times of exposure to dexamethasone and/or TGF-β for 48 or 72 h. The cell monolayers were washed three times with PBS and then fixed with acetone/methanol (50:50) at −20°C for 5 min. Cells were allowed to air dry and then washed with TBST-3% NFDM (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 3% nonfat dry milk). All subsequent incubations with antibodies and washes were performed with this buffer. Cells were incubated with ZO-1 monoclonal antibody R40.76 (1:400 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h and then washed three times. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat IgG anti-rat IgG was added at a 1:100 dilution for 1 h at room temperature and then washed three times. The filters were punched out and mounted on glass slides in 50% glycerol, 50 mM Tris, pH 8-9, and 0.4% n-propyl gallate. Immunofluorescent images were photographed at 1600 ASA with Kodak Ektachrome 400 ASA film. For confocal microscopy, filter-grown monolayers were incubated with combinations of dexamethasone and TGF-β for 72 h. After three washes, the monolayers were fixed with 1.75% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three more times and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Following three washes, cells were then blocked with TBST-3% NFDM. ZO-1 staining was performed as described above. After the ZO-1 immunostaining, cells were stained for F-actin by incubating monolayers with 165 nM rhodamine phalloidin in PBS for 0.5 h. After three washes, filters were mounted on glass slides as described above. Confocal images were obtained from a Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence microscope using a Zeiss 40× Plan-Neofluar multi-immersion objective (0.9 numerical aperture) and analyzed with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 system. A split screen of the double label images was obtained with a dual filter set for fluorescein and Texas red. A series of optical sections was collected for each specimen at ascending z levels beginning at the basal surface in 1-μm increments. Due to the increased thickness of the cell monolayer, the number of optical sections collected in the presence of TGF-β was approximately twice the amount of that collected from monolayers cultured in the absence of TGF-β. In Fig. 2, only the most apical regions of ZO-1 are exhibited in order to investigate whether actin can colocalize with ZO-1 at the apical level. After contrast and zoom enhancements, images were assigned pseudocolors representing the original color of the label used for immunofluorescence and printed with a Kodak Colorease PS printer. Cell lysates were subjected to 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separations Inc., Westboro, MA). The membranes were blocked overnight at 4°C with TBST-5% NFDM and incubated with a mixture of primary rat monoclonal antibodies directed against ZO-1, R40.76 (1:1000), and primary polyclonal E-cadherin antibodies (1:1600) in TBST-1% NFDM overnight at 4°C; secondary antibody directed against rat IgG conjugated to HRPO (Cappel) was diluted 1:10,000 in TBST-1% NFDM and incubated for 1 h. The signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence on Hyperfilm-ECL from Amersham Corp. Parallel cell samples were electrophoretically fractionated, and equivalent protein loading was demonstrated by Coomassie Blue staining of the protein gel. 31EG4 mammary cells from a logarithmically growing culture were transfected by electroporation. Briefly, cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA, washed twice with sterile Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS, and resuspended in sucrose buffer containing 270 mM sucrose, 7 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 1 mM MgCl2. 250 μl of cell suspension and plasmid DNA (15-25 μg total including 10-15 μg of either GRE-CAT or p3TP-lux) were mixed, and 5 electric pulses (400 V square wave pulse for 99 μs) were delivered to the sample using a BTX 800 Transfector apparatus (BTX Inc., San Diego, CA). The samples were incubated for 10 min on ice and cultured at 37°C. 16 h after transfection, the cells were treated for the indicated times with TGF-β and/or dexamethasone in fresh media and harvested for CAT or luciferase assays. Cells harvested for CAT assays were washed three times in PBS, resuspended in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and prepared by four cycles of freeze-thawing. The cell lysates were heated at 68°C for 15 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were recovered. Cells for the luciferase assay were washed three times with PBS and lysed with 1 ml of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CAT activity in the cell extracts containing 30-50 μg of lysate protein was measured by the nonchromatographic assay of Neumann and co-workers(38.Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-447Google Scholar). The enzyme assay was carried out in a final reaction volume of 250 μl in the presence of 1 μCi of [3H]acetyl co-enzyme A (specific activity, 200 mCi/mmol; DuPont), 25 μl of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 50 μl of 5 mM aqueous solution of chloramphenicol. 4 ml of a water-immiscible scintillation fluor (Econofluor, DuPont NEN) was added, and the samples were incubated at 37°C for 4 h. The CAT activity was monitored by direct measurement of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Measurements of CAT activity were in the linear range of the assay as determined by a standard curve using bacterial CAT enzyme. The enzyme activity was expressed as [3H]acetylated chloramphenicol produced (cpm/μg protein/4 h). Pure bacterial CAT enzyme (0.01 units; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was utilized as a positive control for the CAT enzymatic assays, whereas mock transfected cells were used to establish basal level activity. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and was repeated three or more times. For luciferase assays, 20 μl of lysate supernatant for each sample was mixed with 100 μl of Promega's reconstituted luciferase assay reagent (20 mM tricine, 1.07 mM (MgCO3)4Mg(OH)2.5H20, 2.67 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM EDTA, 33.3 mM dithiothreitol, 270 μM coenzyme A, 470 μM luciferin, and 530 μM ATP, pH 7.8) at room temperature. The light produced was measured in Beckman LS 6000IC scintillation counter with the coincidence circuit turned off (under the Single Photon Monitor option) or in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Cells transfected with pUHC131-1(38.Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-447Google Scholar), a plasmid that constitutively expresses the luciferase gene, were utilized as positive control, whereas mock transfected cells were used to establish background level of activity in the assay. We have previously shown that the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, stimulates formation of tight junctions in cultured 31EG4 cells by measuring an increase in TER and a decrease in apical to basolateral movement of small radiolabeled tracers(10.Zettl K.S. Sjaastad M.D. Riskin P.M. Parry G. Machen T.E. Firestone G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9069-9073Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To test the effects of TGF-β on glucocorticoid stimulated tight junction function, confluent monolayers of mammary cells were grown on permeable supports and treated with or without 1 μM dexamethasone (Dex) in the presence or the absence of 10 ng/ml TGF-β. After an approximately 24-h time lag, dexamethasone induced a significant increase in monolayer TER, whereas in untreated cells, the basal TER remained low (Fig. 1). When added simultaneously with dexamethasone, TGF-β completely repressed the ability of glucocorticoids to stimulate TER (Fig. 1). The apical to basal leakage of [14C]mannitol was significantly reduced in dexamethasone-treated cells compared with cells treated with steroid and TGF-β (data not shown), confirming that the failure to increase TER in the presence of TGF-β correlated with a decrease in paracellular permeability through the monolayer. Consistent with its mode of action on mammary gland differentiation (35.Daniel C.W. Robinson S.D. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1992; 32: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the inhibitory effects of TGF-β on steroid-regulated tight junction formation in 31EG4 mammary cells were completely reversible. As also shown in Fig. 1, TGF-β withdrawal from cells treated for 48 h with both dexamethasone and TGF-β led to a rapid stimulation in TER after a 24 h time lag. The observed time course of tight junction formation after TGF-β withdrawal was similar to that in cells initially treated with steroid alone, suggesting that TGF-β may be preventing tight junction function at the earlier steps in the glucocorticoid signal transduction pathway. The reversible nature of the TGF-β-mediated inhibition of tight junction formation demonstrates that TGF-β does not indirectly prevent a stimulation in TER as a result of cytotoxic effects on the mammary cells. To further investigate the mechanism of hormone-regulated tight junction dynamics, we tested whether TGF-β can alter the characteristic tight junction staining and/or expression of ZO-1. As part of this study, F-actin localization was also evaluated because the actin-based cytoskeleton is essential for tight junction assembly and maintenance(24.Stevenson B.R. Begg D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 367-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 31EG4 cells were treated with combinations of dexamethasone and TGF-β for 72 h and doubly stained with primary ZO-1 monoclonal antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG as well as with rhodamine-phalloidin for F-actin. Confocal microscopy was utilized to investigate the spatial relationship between ZO-1 and actin under conditions where tight junctions are tightly sealed by dexamethasone and disrupted by TGF-β. To precisely compare the distribution of ZO-1 with that of actin, optical sections were taken in the x-y plane of ZO-1 and pseudocolors were assigned to ZO-1 as green and actin as red. The images shown in Fig. 2 illustrate sections at the apical plane of the tight junction (top panels) and the plane 2 μm lower (bottom panels). Cells that were not treated with steroid or growth factor (Fig. 2, a and b) displayed ZO-1 and actin colocalization as a fine ring at the cell periphery at the most apical cell-cell border. Consistent with our previous results(9.Singer K.L. Stevenson B.R. Woo P.L. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16108-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cells grown in the presence of dexamethasone were larger and had a greater linear junction length per cell (Fig. 2, c and d versus a and b). In dexamethasone-treated cells, ZO-1 and actin colocalizes in the lower plane (Fig. 2, d), but actin signal is significantly decreased in the upper plane (Fig. 2, c). Therefore, under conditions where TER is greatly enhanced by dexamethasone, actin appears to be absent from the most apical region of ZO-1 localization. TGF-β drastically disrupted the overall pattern of ZO-1 and actin staining in glucocorticoid-treated (Fig. 2, e and f) and untreated (Fig. 2, g and h) cells, causing a redistribution from points of cell-cell contacts to a more broad and cytoplasmic staining. Immunostaining at the upper plane of TGF-β-treated cells revealed a complete loss of ZO-1 junctional staining with both ZO-1 and actin displaying a dispersed colocalization in this region (Fig. 2, e versus a). At the more basolateral plane of TGF-β-treated cells (Fig. 2, f), some ZO-1 is seen to localize at the cell periphery, but the staining lacks the complete tight rings typical of junctional associated plaque proteins. When the mammary cells were cultured in the presence of both dexamethasone and TGF-β (Fig. 2, g and h), there is slightly more specific junctional staining of ZO-1 and actin. In the upper left portion, ZO-1 and actin"

NSF possesses N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive ATPase activity (13.Tagaya M. Wilson D.W. Brunner M. Arango N. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2662-2666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the two homologous nucleotide-binding regions of NSF are involved in ATP hydrolysis(14.Sumida M. Hong R.-M. Tagaya M. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar).NSF seems to exist as both membrane-associated and free forms in vivo, although intracellular concentrations of Mg2+ and ATP are high enough to induce the disassembly of the 20 S complex. This is suggested by the fact that isolated Golgi membranes contain sufficient amounts of NSF to accomplish intra-Golgi protein transport(1.Glick B.S. Rothman J.E.

In other cell-free assays that reconstitute the secretory and endocytotic transport pathways in which NSF is involved, NSF activity seems to be also derived from membrane fractions(4.Beckers C.J.M.

These results raise the possibility that there is a factor(s) that mediates the association of NSF to membranes in the presence of Mg2+-ATP.In the present study we investigated the mechanism underlying the association of NSF with Golgi apparatus by using digitonin-permeabilized PC12 cells and isolated Golgi membranes. We found that the Mg2+-ATP-induced release of NSF from the Golgi apparatus is prevented by α-SNAP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsPC12 cells were purchased from the Riken Cell Bank. Chinese hamster ovary Golgi membranes were prepared as described by Balch et al.(19.Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E.

Arango N. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2662-2666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following plasmid and antibodies were kindly donated (suppliers in parentheses): a plasmid encoding His6-tagged α-SNAP and polyclonal anti-α-SNAP (Drs. M. Brunner and J. E. Rothman), polyclonal anti-mannosidase II (Dr. K. Moremen), and polyclonal anti-VAMP-2 and monoclonal anti-synaptotagmin (Dr. Masami Takahashi).Cell CulturePC12 cells were grown on glass or plastic coverslips precoated with collagen (type I) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 7.5% fetal calf serum, and 7.5% horse serum. Neuronal cell cultures were prepared by the treatment of PC12 cells with 40 ng/ml of nerve growth factor for 3-4 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 × GMS-G (Life Technologies, Inc.).Cell PermeabilizationPC12 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS twice and then incubated in EDTA-ATP buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) containing 4 mM EDTA, 1 mM ATP, 50 mM KCl, and 0.25 M sucrose) in the presence of 33-40 μM digitonin at 0°C for 10 min. After washing with ice-cold EDTA-ATP buffer twice, the cells were incubated in EDTA-ATP buffer or Mg-ATP buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) containing 5 mM MgClS2, 1 mM ATP, 50 mM KCl, and 0.25 M sucrose) at 0°C for 30 min.Immunofluorescence StainingPermeabilized cells were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.15 M sucrose, treated with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and then incubated in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. After incubation with primary antibodies, the cells were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgGs (Cappel Organon Teknika) and/or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgGs (Chemicon). The coverslips were mounted with PBS containing 90% glycerol, 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine, and 10 mM sodium azide and then observed under an Olympus BX50 microscope.NSF Release from Isolated Golgi MembranesIsolated Golgi membranes were incubated in EDTA-ATP or Mg-ATP buffer (0.4 ml) in the presence or the absence of His6-tagged α-SNAP on ice. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was concentrated with 6% trichloroacetic acid and 0.02% deoxycholate. The membrane pellet and the concentrated supernatant were subjected to electrophoresis according to the method of Laemmli (21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205950) Google Scholar) with 10% gels. Detection of NSF on immunoblots was performed with the ECL system. The amount of NSF on blots was determined densitometrically with a Shimazu CS-9300PC scanning densitometer.RESULTSMg2+-ATP Induces the Release of NSF from the Golgi Apparatus in Permeabilized PC12 CellsWe first investigated the distribution of NSF in PC12 cells, in which NSF is highly expressed. Significant immunoreactivity for NSF was observed on one side of the perinuclear region (Fig. 1A). Double immunofluorescence analysis revealed that this staining pattern coincides well with that of the mannosidase II, a medial Golgi marker protein (Fig. 1, A and B). The faint immunoreactivity for NSF throughout cells may reflect its presence in the cytosol. When a control antibody was used instead of anti-NSF antibody, no significant staining was observed at any region of cells (Fig. 1C).We next examined whether Mg2+-ATP induces the release of NSF from the Golgi apparatus in digitonin-permeabilized PC12 cells, as observed in isolated Golgi membranes(1.Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1987; 326: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Digitonin is a nonionic detergent that has been used to permeabilize a variety of cells(22.Diaz R. Stahl P.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 25-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23.Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24.Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). During digitonin permeabilization and subsequent incubation, the cytosol gradually leaks from digitonin-permeabilized cells(25.Sarafian T. Aunis D. Bader M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16671-16676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When PC12 cells were solubilized with digitonin in the presence of EDTA-ATP for 10 min, washed to remove the detergent, and then incubated with Mg2+-ATP for 30 min, almost all NSF disappeared from the Golgi area (Fig. 2A). The immunoreactivity for NSF throughout cells also disappeared. The disappearance of NSF was not due to distortion or loss of the Golgi apparatus because the mannosidase II immunostaining pattern did not change with this treatment (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the presence of NSF in the nuclear membranes became obvious when NSF was released from the Golgi apparatus. It should be noted that immunoreactivity for NSF was less significant but detectable in the nuclear membranes of nontreated PC12 cells (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the presence of NSF in the nuclear membranes is not a consequence of permeabilization and incubation with Mg2+-ATP. We isolated nuclei from bovine adrenal medulla and found that NSF is indeed associated with the nuclear membranes. 2M. Tagaya and S. Mizushima, unpublished data. Previous studies showed that Mg2+ is essential for the release of NSF from isolated Golgi membranes(1.Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1987; 326: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 11.Wilson D.W. Whiteheart S.W. Wiedmann M. Brunner M. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results, the release of NSF from the Golgi apparatus in permeabilized cells did not occur in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2(C and D) shows the co-localization of NSF and mannosidase II more clearly than Fig. 1(A and B) due to the loss of cytosolic immunoreactivity.Figure 2:NSF was released from the Golgi apparatus by Mg2+-ATP but not EDTA-ATP in digitonin-permeabilized PC12 cells. Permeabilized nonneural PC12 cells were incubated in Mg-ATP buffer (A and B) or EDTA-ATP buffer (C and D). Double immunofluorescence for NSF (A and C) and mannosidase II (B and D).

Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar). When neural (nerve growth factor-treated) PC12 cells were used, NSF associated with the Golgi apparatus behaved in essentially the same manner as that in the nonneural cells, that is, NSF in the Golgi apparatus was released by Mg2+-ATP (Fig. 3A) but not by EDTA-ATP (Fig. 3C). In neural PC12 cells, punctate immunoreactivity for NSF was observed in neuritic processes including neuronal growth cones (Fig. 3, A, B, and C). Synaptic vesicles were concentrated at growth cones, as revealed by the presence of VAMP-2 (Fig. 3D) and synaptotagmin (Fig. 3E), both of which are synaptic vesicle-associated proteins(27.Jahn R. Schiebler W. Quimet C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4137-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 28.Wiedenmann B. Franke W.W.

It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that the immunoreactivity for NSF in neuronal growth cones reflects the association of NSF with synaptic vesicles. It is noteworthy that NSF in neuronal growth cones was not released on incubation with Mg2+-ATP (Fig. 3B). This is consistent with our previous finding that NSF is not released from rat synaptic vesicles by Mg2+ -ATP(18.Hong R.-M. Mori H. Fukui T. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. Tagaya M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When almost all NSF had been removed from the Golgi area on incubation with Mg2+-ATP, immunoreactivity for VAMP-2 became detectable in the Golgi area (Fig. 3D). Such a pattern was not observed when permeabilized PC12 cells were incubated in EDTA-ATP (data not shown). The co-localization of NSF and VAMP-2 in the Golgi area of Mg2+-ATP-treated cells was recognizable because of the presence of a trace amount of NSF in the Golgi area (Fig. 3, A and D). This finding can be explained by the idea that the epitope of VAMP-2 became accessible to an anti-VAMP antibody after the release of NSF. Because NSF is a large protein, it is possible that NSF covers the epitope of membrane-embedded VAMP-2. Such co-localization was not significantly observed in nonneural cells (data not shown).Figure 3:Distribution of NSF and synaptic vesicle-associated proteins in digitonin-permeabilized neural PC12 cells. Permeabilized neural PC12 cells were incubated in Mg-ATP buffer (A, B, D, and E) or EDTA-ATP (C). Mg2+-ATP-treated cells were double labeled for NSF (A) and VAMP-2 (D). A neuronal growth cone in a Mg2+-ATP-treated cell was labeled for NSF (B).EDTA-ATP-treated cells were labeled for NSF (C). Mg2+-ATP-treated cells were labeled for synaptotagmin (E). In C, the Golgi apparatus is located in punctate structures surrounding the nucleus. The arrow in A indicates NSF in the Golgi area that slightly remained after Mg2+-ATP treatment.

This effect was dose-dependent, and almost complete inhibition of the release of NSF was observed at cytosol concentrations of 200-700 μg/ml. The cytosol lost this inhibitory activity on heat treatment. These results suggest the presence of a protein factor(s) in bovine brain cytosol that prevents Mg2+-induced NSF release from the Golgi apparatus.Figure 4:A cytosolic factor(s) prevents the release of NSF from the Golgi apparatus in permeabilized PC12 cells. Permeabilized PC12 cells were incubated in Mg-ATP buffer containing the indicated concentrations of bovine brain cytosol or heat-treated cytosol. Heat treatment was carried out at 100°C for 5 min. The bar corresponds to 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When bovine brain cytosol was fractionated with Superose 12, the factor(s) was eluted in fractions 12 to 14 (Fig. 5). This elution position corresponds to that of 30-40-kDa proteins. Because the relative molecular masses of α-, β-, and γ-SNAPs are 35, 36, and 39 kDa, respectively(8.Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10109-10117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the co-elution of SNAPs in these fractions was examined. Immunoblotting analysis with an anti-SNAP antibody that recognizes α- and β-SNAPs revealed that these SNAPs were eluted in these fractions. When bovine brain cytosol was fractionated with a Q-cartridge column, the factor(s) was also co-eluted with SNAPs (data not shown).Figure 5:The activity that prevents the Mg2+-ATP-induced release of NSF from the Golgi apparatus was co-fractionated with SNAPs. Elution profile on Superose 12 chromatography. A bovine brain cytosolic fraction (0.6 ml) was applied to a Superose 12 column that had been equilibrated with 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 50 mM KCl and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol. The column was developed with the same buffer at the flow rate of 0.25 ml/min, and fractions of 1 ml each were collected. Portions of the fractions were used for measurement of the activity preventing the release of NSF from the Golgi apparatus in permeabilized neural PC12 cells and for immunoblotting for SNAPs. α- and β-SNAPs were not resolved with this electrophoretic system. The bar corresponds to 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)α- and γ-SNAPs are expressed in a wide range of tissues(31.Whiteheart S.W. Griff I.C. Brunner M. Clary D.O. Mayer T. Buhrow S.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and α-SNAP shows about 6-fold higher activity than γ-SNAP in an intra-Golgi protein transport assay(8.Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10109-10117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Clary D.O. Griff I.C. Rothman J.E.

Nature. 1993; 362: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of α-SNAP on the Mg2+-ATP-induced release of NSF from the Golgi apparatus. When His6-tagged α-SNAP purified from Escherichia coli was added on incubation with Mg2+-ATP after permeabilization, it prevented the Mg2+-ATP-induced release of NSF from the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 6). The inhibition of NSF release was detectable at 0.6 μg/ml α-SNAP, and almost complete inhibition was observed at concentrations of 1-2 μg/ml. His6-tagged α-SNAP lost this inhibitory activity on heat treatment, as observed in bovine brain cytosol.Figure 6:α-SNAP prevents the Mg2+-ATP-induced NSF release from the Golgi apparatus in permeabilized PC12 cells. Permeabilized nonneural PC12 cells were incubated in Mg-ATP buffer containing the indicated concentrations of His6-tagged α-SNAP or heat-treated His6-tagged α-SNAP. Essentially the same results were obtained for neural PC12 cells. The bar corresponds to 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether or not SNAPs are major factors in bovine brain cytosol that prevent the release of NSF from the Golgi apparatus, we determined the content of SNAPs in our cytosol preparation. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that the content of SNAPs (the sum of α- and β-SNAPs) comprised approximately 0.3-0.4% of the total cytosolic proteins (data not shown). This value is in good agreement with that reported by Clary and Rothman(8.Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10109-10117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this estimation, the concentration of SNAPs was calculated to be 0.6-2.8 μg/ml in 200-700 μg/ml cytosol. Because 1-2 μg/ml SNAPs is required for almost complete inhibition, we concluded that the majority of the activity that prevents Mg2+-ATP-induced NSF release from the Golgi apparatus in bovine brain cytosol is due to α- and β-SNAPs. Of course, it is possible that γ-SNAP synergistically prevents the release of NSF from the Golgi apparatus, as observed in the binding of NSF to isolated Golgi membranes(11.Wilson D.W. Whiteheart S.W. Wiedmann M. Brunner M. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).α-SNAP Prevents the Mg2+-ATP-induced Release of NSF from Isolated Golgi MembranesWe next examined whether or not α-SNAP prevents the Mg2+-ATP-induced release of NSF from isolated Golgi membranes. For this purpose, isolated Golgi membranes were incubated with EDTA-ATP or Mg2+-ATP in the presence or the absence of α-SNAP, and the amounts of membrane-associated NSF and released NSF were estimated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When Golgi membranes were incubated with EDTA-ATP, only 17% of total NSF was released from membranes, whereas 83% was not (Fig. 7 and Table 1). On the other hand, on incubation with Mg2+-ATP, the amount of NSF recovered in the supernatant increased and that in the pellet decreased. The amount of total NSF in the the Mg2+-ATP-treated sample was 1.4 times larger than that in the EDTA-ATP-treated sample. This was probably due to the slight underestimation of the amount of NSF in the pellet. The efficiency of immunostaining seemed to be low when samples contained membranes. Although the results were semiquantitative, it was obvious that a major fraction of NSF associated with membranes is released in a Mg2+-ATP-dependent manner. When 0.5 μg/ml or higher concentrations of His6-tagged α-SNAP were added during incubation with Mg2+-ATP, the amount of NSF recovered in the supernatant decreased to a level found on incubation with EDTA-ATP, suggesting that α-SNAP also prevents the Mg2+-ATP-induced release of NSF from isolated Golgi membranes. We do not know why 30-35% of the membrane-associated NSF was not released on incubation with Mg-ATP. One possibility is that our Golgi membrane preparations contain membranes in which NSF is not released by Mg2+-ATP. As demonstrated by the previous (18.Hong R.-M. Mori H. Fukui T. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. Tagaya M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and present studies, NSF associated with synaptic vesicles and the nuclear membranes are not released by Mg2+-ATP. Likewise, NSF associated with other membranes such as endosome vesicles, which are present in Golgi membrane preparations, may not be released by Mg2+-ATP.Figure 7:α-SNAP prevents the Mg2+-ATP-induced NSF release from isolated Golgi membranes. Isolated Golgi membranes were incubated at 0°C for 30 min in EDTA-ATP buffer (lanes 1 and 6) or Mg-ATP buffer in the absence (lanes 2 and 7) or the presence of 0.5 μg/ml (lanes 3 and 8), 2.0 μg/ml (lanes 4 and 9), or 10 μg/ml His6-tagged α-SNAP (lanes 5 and 10). NSF in the pellets (lanes 1-5) and the supernatants (lanes 6-10) was visualized by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab There are several possible explanations for the inhibitory effect of α-SNAP on the release of NSF from the Golgi apparatus. Because the release of NSF occurs under conditions favoring ATP hydrolysis, one possibility is that α-SNAP inhibits the ATPase activity of NSF. However, this possibility is unlikely because a recent study demonstrated that SNAPs stimulate the ATPase activity of NSF(32.Morgan A. Dimaline R. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29347-29350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another possibility is that SNAPs bind to released NSF and return it to the Golgi apparatus. To examine the latter possibility, α-SNAP was added after a 15-min incubation of isolated Golgi membranes with Mg-ATP, and then the incubation was continued for another 15 min. The amount of NSF released by 15 min was comparable to that released by 30 min, indicating that the release of NSF by Mg2+-ATP is almost completed by 15 min (Fig. 8 and Table 2). The addition of α-SNAP after a 15-min incubation resulted in the reassociation of the released NSF with Golgi membranes, suggesting that α-SNAP has the ability to mediate the reassociation of NSF with Golgi membranes. It was not certain whether NSF was not released from Golgi membranes or released and then returned to Golgi membranes when α-SNAP was added at the start of the incubation. It is possible that α-SNAP binds to disassembled NSF before its release from Golgi membranes and makes NSF become attached to the membranes if it is present at the start of the incubation with Mg2+-ATP.Figure 8:α-SNAP mediates reassociation of NSF with isolated Golgi membranes. Isolated Golgi membranes were incubated at 0°C in EDTA-ATP buffer for 30 min (lanes 1 and 5) or Mg-ATP buffer for 30 (lanes 2 and 6) or 15 min (lanes 3 and 7). Alternatively, Golgi membranes were incubated at 0°C in Mg-ATP buffer for 15 min and then further incubated for 15 min in the presence of 10 μg/ml His6-tagged α-SNAP (lanes 4 and 8). NSF in the pellets (lanes 1-4) and the supernatants (lanes 5-8) was visualized by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we used digitonin-permeabilized PC12 cells to investigate the mechanism underlying the association of NSF with membranes. NSF associated with the Golgi apparatus was released by Mg2+-ATP, as observed with isolated Golgi membranes(1.Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1987; 326: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), whereas NSF located in the nuclear membranes and neuronal growth cones was not released by Mg2+-ATP. The addition of bovine brain cytosol prevented the release of NSF from the Golgi apparatus in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was prevented by heat treatment. These results suggest the presence of a protein factor(s) that inhibits the release of NSF. Gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography of bovine brain cytosol revealed that the factor(s) was co-eluted with SNAPs. Furthermore, purified His6-tagged α-SNAP exhibited such activity. Estimation of the SNAP content in bovine brain cytosol suggested that the majority of the activity that prevents the release of NSF from the Golgi apparatus is due to α- and β-SNAPs. α-SNAP also prevented the Mg2+-ATP-induced release of NSF from isolated Golgi membranes.SNAPs were identified as components that mediate the attachment of NSF to Golgi membranes(33.Weidman P.J. Melançon P. Block M.R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because NSF is released from Golgi membranes by Mg2+-ATP(1.Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1987; 326: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), SNAP activity had only been measured in the presence of EDTA-ATP(8.Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). No one has so far investigated whether or not SNAPs have the ability to mediate the attachment of NSF to Golgi membranes in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. The present results clearly show that α-SNAP prevents the Mg2+-ATP-induced release of NSF from Golgi membranes by mediating the reassociation of disassembled NSF with membranes.

Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a 20 S complex comprising NSF, SNAPs, and SNAREs is completely disassembled by Mg2+-ATP. In their experiments, reconstitution of the 20 S complex was performed by incubation of NSF and α-SNAP in an equimolar ratio. This may be the reason why the formation of the complex does not occur in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. In the present study, an excess amount of α-SNAP was added over NSF that is present in permeabilized cells and isolated Golgi membranes. Under this condition, SNAP may bind to the disassembled NSF and thereby cause reassociation of the 20 S complex.It was recently found that SNAPs stimulate the regulated exocytosis of catecholamine in chromaffin cells (6.Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and the transport of vesicular stomatitis-virus encoded glycoprotein to the basolateral membrane(17.Ikonen E. Tagaya M. Ullrich O. Montecucco C. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 571-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, NSF does not stimulate regulated exocytosis(6.Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Morgan and Burgoyne (6.Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) assumed that NSF is expressed at supramaximal levels in chromaffin cells and that SNAPs expression is limiting. Because Mg2+-ATP is indispensable for protein transport and therefore always included in cell-free protein transport assays, some fraction of NSF must be released from membranes because of the limited amount of SNAPs in the assay mixture. If so, it is expected that the addition of SNAPs increases the number of NSF molecules associated with membranes in the presence of Mg2+-ATP and therefore stimulates protein transport.According to the model proposed by Rothman and his colleagues(10.Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2602) Google Scholar, 12.Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W.

Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar), synaptotagmin, a vesicle-SNARE (VAMP-2), and target SNAREs (syntaxin and SNAP-25) form a complex, and then NSF and SNAPs bind to this complex in the presence of calcium. Subsequent ATP hydrolysis by NSF causes the disassembly of the complex, which in turn promotes membrane fusion. This model predicts the transient binding of NSF from the cytosol to the SNAREs complex on the plasma membrane. However, there is so far no direct evidence that NSF and SNAP derived from the cytosolic pool mediate membrane fusion. We previously showed that NSF is associated with synaptic vesicles in the absence of calcium influx and not released on incubation with Mg2+-ATP (18.Hong R.-M. Mori H. Fukui T. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. Tagaya M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Based on these findings and the results of kinetic studies involving an intra-Golgi protein transport assay(14.Sumida M. Hong R.-M. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20636-20641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Wattenberg B.W. Raub T.J. Hiebsch R.R. Weidman P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we suggested that NSF is a constitutive component of transport vesicles. Consistent with this idea, NSF is present in punctate structures in the neuronal growth cones of neural PC12 cells, where synaptic vesicles are concentrated. As in the case of rat brain synaptic vesicles, NSF in the cone area is not released on incubation with Mg2+-ATP. The present results combined with the recent finding that syntaxin 1 is associated with vesicles as well as target membranes (36.Walch-Solimena C. Blasi J. Edelmann L. Chapman E.R.

INTRODUCTIONThe N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) 1The abbreviations used are: NSFN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factorSNAPsoluble NSF attachment proteinSNARESNAP receptorPBSphosphate-buffered saline. was originally characterized as a protein that is implicated in intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated protein transport(1.Glick B.S.

A. 1988; 85: 7852-7856Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that NSF most likely mediates the fusion of Golgi-derived transport vesicles with target membranes(3.Malhotra V. Orci L. Glick B.S. Block M.R. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1988; 54: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Later studies revealed that NSF is also involved in protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus(4.Beckers C.J.M. Block M.R. Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Balch W.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 397-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), endosome fusion(5.Diaz R. Mayorga L.S. Weidman P.J. Rothman J.E. Stahl P.D. Nature. 1989; 339: 398-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and exocytosis of neurotransmitters(6.Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D.

Nature. 1995; 373: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). NSF is a soluble protein, and its attachment to membranes in the absence of Mg2+-ATP is mediated by three peripheral membrane proteins named α-, β-, and γ-SNAPs(8.Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10109-10117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Clary D.O. Griff I.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1990; 61: 709-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar).

Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2602) Google Scholar) showed that syntaxin 1, SNAP-25, and VAMP-2 are membrane-embedded SNAP receptors (SNAREs). NSF, SNAPs, and SNAREs are associated to form a 20 S complex in membranes(10.Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E.

Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Incubation of Golgi membranes with Mg2+-ATP induces the disassembly of the 20 S complex, and thereby results in the release of membrane-bound NSF(1.Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1987; 326: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 10.Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E.

Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). The driving force disrupting the 20 S complex is probably derived from the NSF-catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP. NSF possesses N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive ATPase activity (13.Tagaya M. Wilson D.W. Brunner M. Arango N. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2662-2666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the two homologous nucleotide-binding regions of NSF are involved in ATP hydrolysis(14.Sumida M. Hong R.-M. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20636-20641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar).NSF seems to exist as both membrane-associated and free forms in vivo, although intracellular concentrations of Mg2+ and ATP are high enough to induce the disassembly of the 20 S complex. This is suggested by the fact that isolated Golgi membranes contain sufficient amounts of NSF to accomplish intra-Golgi protein transport(1.Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1987; 326: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 2.Block M.R. Glick B.S. Wilcox C.A. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1988; 54: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In other cell-free assays that reconstitute the secretory and endocytotic transport pathways in which NSF is involved, NSF activity seems to be also derived from membrane fractions(4.Beckers C.J.M. Block M.R. Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Balch W.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 397-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5.Diaz R. Mayorga L.S. Weidman P.J. Rothman J.E. Stahl P.D.

Fukui T. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. Tagaya M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These results raise the possibility that there is a factor(s) that mediates the association of NSF to membranes in the presence of Mg2+-ATP.In the present study we investigated the mechanism underlying the association of NSF with Golgi apparatus by using digitonin-permeabilized PC12 cells and isolated Golgi membranes. We found that the Mg2+-ATP-induced release of NSF from the Golgi apparatus is prevented by α-SNAP."

Two different Ca2+ responses were observed, which differed in their delays and kinetics. The first response, which occurred after a shorter delay, exhibited a single Ca2+ peak often followed by a plateau, while the second type of response was characterized by a longer delay and by Ca2+ spikes with different frequencies and amplitudes. The latter phenomenon was never observed after stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors for ATP, ET-1, and BK. The incubation with the inhibitor of sphingosine kinase, DL-threo-dihydrosphingosine, significantly increased the percentage of cells responding to PDGF-BB exposure with Ca2+ spikes (87 versus 47%), while it did not modify the Ca2+ response elicited by exposure to ATP, ET-1, or BK. Exposure to exogenous 10 μM sphingosine or 1 μM sphingosine 1-phosphate produced oscillatory and non-oscillatory Ca2+ responses, respectively, similar to those elicited by PDGF-BB. A second application of PDGF-BB, 30 min after the first, was normally ineffective in producing a Ca2+ response. However, if the second exposure was preceded by the inhibition of sphingosine 1-phosphate formation, an oscillatory Ca2+ response occurred in all cells.

In contrast, the elegantin which has different amino acids around RGD (ARGDNP) preferentially inhibited platelet adhesion to fibronectin. To investigate further the role of amino acids around RGD in disintegrins, we have constructed the genes of a wild-type and of two mutant dendroaspins with substitutions around the RGD, namely [Asn46]- and [Ala42,Asn46]dendroaspins. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion recombinants and purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Platelet aggregation studies revealed that wild-type dendroaspin showed an IC50 value similar to that of native dendroaspin, with [Ala42,Asn46]dendroaspin showing an IC50 value similar to that of elegantin. Interestingly, in platelet adhesion assays, the mutants showed a progressive shift in inhibitory preference, in particular, [Ala42,Asn46]dendroaspin showed nearly identical behavior as elegantin when fibronectin was the immobilized ligand (IC50 = 0.33 μM and 0.6 μM, respectively, compared with 20 μM for native dendroaspin). Native and recombinant wild-type dendroaspin bound to a single class of binding site exhibiting a Kd = 67 nM; [Asn46]- and [Ala42,Asn46]dendroaspins, however, both produced biphasic isotherms with Kdvalues = 87 nM and 361 nM for [Asn46]dendroaspin and 33 nM and 371 nM for [Ala42,Asn46]dendroaspin, which are close to those of elegantin (Kd values = 18 nM and 179 nM).

https://openalex.org/W1592932769,"Degradation of a protein via the ubiquitin system involves two discrete steps, conjugation of ubiquitin to the substrate and degradation of the adduct. Conjugation follows a three-step mechanism. First, ubiquitin is activated by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1. Following activation, one of several E2 enzymes (ubiquitin-carrier proteins or ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, UBCs) transfers ubiquitin from E1 to the protein substrate that is bound to one of several ubiquitin-protein ligases, E3s. These enzymes catalyze the last step in the process, covalent attachment of ubiquitin to the protein substrate. The binding of the substrate to E3 is specific and implies that E3s play a major role in recognition and selection of proteins for conjugation and subsequent degradation. So far, only a few ligases have been identified, and it is clear that many more have not been discovered yet. Here, we describe a novel ligase that is involved in the conjugation and degradation of non “N-end rule” protein substrates such as actin, troponin T, and MyoD. This substrate specificity suggests that the enzyme may be involved in degradation of muscle proteins. The ligase acts in concert with E2-F1, a previously described non N-end rule UBC. Interestingly, it is also involved in targeting lysozyme, a bona fide N-end rule substrate that is recognized by E3α and E2-14 kDa. The novel ligase recognizes lysozyme via a signal(s) that is distinct from the N-terminal residue of the protein. Thus, it appears that certain proteins can be targeted via multiple recognition motifs and distinct pairs of conjugating enzymes. We have purified the ligase ~200-fold and demonstrated that it is different from other known E3s, including E3α/UBR1, E3β, and E6-AP. The native enzyme has an apparent molecular mass of ~550 kDa and appears to be a homodimer. Because of its unusual size, we designated this novel ligase E3L (large). E3L contains an -SH group that is essential for its activity. Like several recently described E3 enzymes, including E6-AP and the ligase involved in the processing of p105, the NF-κB precursor, the novel ligase is found in mammalian tissues but not in wheat germ.

Among these are mitotic cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, the NF-κB p105 precursor and the inhibitor IκBα, p53 and the transcriptional activator AP-1, and major histocompatibility complex class I antigens (reviewed in (1.Hochstrasser M.

Degradation of a protein via the ubiquitin pathway involves two distinct steps: signaling of the protein by covalent attachment of multiple molecules of ubiquitin and degradation of the targeted protein by the 26 S proteasome complex. Conjugation of ubiquitin involves a three-step mechanism. Following activation of the C-terminal Gly of ubiquitin by E1, one of several E2 enzymes transfers ubiquitin to the substrate that is specifically bound to a member of the ubiquitin-protein ligase family, E3. The ligase catalyzes the last step in the conjugation process, formation of an isopeptide bond between the activated Gly residue of ubiquitin, and an ϵ-NH2 group of a Lys residue in the substrate or in the previously conjugated ubiquitin moiety. The structure of the ubiquitin system appears to be hierarchial: a single E1 carries out, most probably, activation of ubiquitin required for all modifications.

All these E2 enzymes act in concert with E3s, and it appears that each E2 enzyme can act with one or more E3 proteins. Five E3 enzymes have been described so far. (a) Mammalian E3α (UBR1 in yeast) recognizes protein substrates via their free basic or bulky hydrophobic N-terminal amino acid residues (N-end rule; reviewed in (7.Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) and (15.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar)). (b) Similarly, E3β recognizes N-end rule substrates via their free small uncharged N-terminal residues(16.Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 265: 6532-6535Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). (c) E6-AP is involved in the recognition of p53(12.Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar, 17.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar). Recently, a series of unique E6-AP homologous proteins have been identified(19.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar); however, their role as E3 enzymes and the identity of their putative substrates is still obscure. (d) E3-C is involved in cell cycle-dependent conjugation and degradation of mitotic cyclins. The ligase is a component of a large particle (~1,500 kDa), the cyclosome (20.Sudakin V. Ganoth D. Dahan A. Heller H. Hershko J. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) or the anaphase-promoting complex(21.King R.W. Peters J.-M. Tugendreich S. Rolfe M. Hieter P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), that regulates the programmed destruction of mitotic cyclins containing the “destruction box” motif RAALGNISEN(22.Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). E3-C is inactive during interphase and is activated during M phase, most probably by phosphorylation. The cyclosome contains also CDC16, CDC27 (21.King R.W. Peters J.-M. Tugendreich S. Rolfe M. Hieter P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 23.Tugendreich S. Tomkiel J. Earnshaw W. Hieter T.

Cell. 1995; 81: 269-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether E3 is one of these components, or whether it is a distinct component of the complex. (e) Processing of p105, the NF-κB transcriptional activator precursor, involves yet a novel ligase(14.Orian A. Whiteside S. Israël A. Stancovski I. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21707-21714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); however, the enzyme and its mode of action have not been characterized. An important, yet unresolved, problem involves the hierarchial relationships between the ligases and their cognate substrates. It is unlikely that a single E3 enzyme recognizes a specific, single substrate. Rather, it is conceivable that each ligase recognizes similar, but not necessarily identical, shared motifs in a subset of protein substrates. These motifs can be either primary, or generated post-translationally. Secondary targeting signals can be, for example, cell cycle- or signal transduction-induced phosphorylations. N-end rule substrates are recognized by a “pair” of defined E2-E3 enzymes, the mammalian E2-14 kDa and its yeast homolog UBC2/RAD6, and E3α and its yeast homolog UBR1(7.Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 15.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). The mode of recognition of non-N-end rule substrates is more elaborate: the recognition motifs are poorly understood and the conjugating enzymes do not necessarily consist of defined pairs. Recognition of some substrates is mediated by E2 enzymes that are homologous to the yeast UBC4 and UBC5. These enzymes can be either the A. thaliana UBC8(6.Girod P.-A. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 955-960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar), the rabbit E2-F1(10.Blumenfeld N. Gonen H. Mayer A. Smith C.E. Siegel N.R. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9574-9581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the human UbcH5(11.Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, the conjugation reactions are catalyzed by distinct ligases. For example, the ligase that is involved in processing of p105 (14.Orian A. Whiteside S. Israël A. Stancovski I. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21707-21714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) is clearly different from E6-AP, the p53 conjugating enzyme(12.Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar, 17.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that E2-F1 or UbcH5 can each act in concert with several species of E3s. For the N-end rule pair, it has been shown that E3α/UBR1 has a binding site for its cognate E2 enzyme, E2-14 kDa/UBC2-RAD6(8.Sung P. Berleth E. Pickart C. Prakash S. Prakash L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2187-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 25.Madura K. Dohmen R.J. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12046-12054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Reiss Y. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10378-10383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known whether E2-F1 or UbcH5 associates with their different ligases, although the necessity to preserve the activation energy suggests that such interaction does exist. Despite this complexity, it is assumed that a single substrate follows a single degradation pathway: it is recognized via a single recognition motif and by one pair of conjugating enzymes. The repressor MATα2 appears to be one exception to this rule. It has two degradation signals (27.Hochstrasser M. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1990; 61: 697-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and is recognized by four E2 enzymes (28.Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1993; 74: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar; see “Discussion”). Here we demonstrate that lysozyme is conjugated and degraded by two distinct, however ubiquitin-dependent, pathways. The protein is conjugated by E2-14 kDa-E3α and recognized via its basic N-terminal residue, Lys(29.Reiss Y. Kaim D. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2693-2698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it is also conjugated and degraded by a non-N-end rule pathway consisting of E2-F1 and a novel, yet unidentified, species of E3 (designated E3L). The recognition motif, that is clearly distinct from the N-terminal Lys, has not been identified.

Reticulocyte-rich blood was induced in rabbits by successive injections of phenylhydrazine, and reticulocyte lysate was prepared as described(30.Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were resolved by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose into unadsorbed material (Fraction I) and high salt eluate (Fraction II) as described(30.Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E1, E2-14 kDa, and E3α were purified from Fraction II by affinity chromatography over immobilized ubiquitin and immobilized β-lactoglobulin as described(31.Reiss Y. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3685-3690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E2-F1 was purified to homogeneity from Fraction I as described(10.Blumenfeld N. Gonen H. Mayer A. Smith C.E. Siegel N.R. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9574-9581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UbcH5 cDNA cloned into pET3a vector was a generous gift from Dr. M. Scheffner, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. The cDNA was expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli(11.Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and purified from the bacterial extracts following induction as following: extract (from 1 liter of cultured cells) was chromatographed on DEAE-anion exchange resin. Fraction I (~75 mg of protein) was concentrated (to ~2.5 ml) using Centriprep 10 and resolved on HiLoad Superdex 75 HR, employing an FPLC system, in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT (buffer A). 2.4-ml fractions were collected and the enzyme was detected via Coomassie staining of aliquots from the various fractions that were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Salt was removed by repeated concentration-dilution cycles using Centricon 10 microconcentrators and a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 2 mM DTT (buffer B). The UbcH5-containing fractions were concentrated to 100 μl and pooled. We obtained ~1 mg of >85% homogeneous protein. 125I-Labeled proteins were prepared by the chloramine T method as described(10.Blumenfeld N. Gonen H. Mayer A. Smith C.E. Siegel N.R. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9574-9581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation and conjugation assays were performed essentially as described(13.Ciechanover A. Shkedy D. Oren M. Bercovich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9582-9589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained in a final volume of 25 μl: crude reticulocyte lysate (10 μl;~1 mg of protein) Fraction II (~100 μg of protein), or wheat germ extract (~100 μg of protein), 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 5 μg of ubiquitin, and125 I-labeled substrate (~2 × 105 cpm). Reaction mixture without ATP contained 0.5 μg of hexokinase and 10 mM 2-deoxyglucose. ATP-dependent degradation was monitored in the presence of 0.5 mM ATP, 10 mM phosphocreatine, and 5 μg of creatine kinase. In the conjugation assays, 0.5 μg of ubiquitin aldehyde (32.Hershko A. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1829-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and 5 mM ATPγS substituted for ATP and the ATP-regenerating system. Conjugation assays containing purified components were performed in the presence of: 2 μg of E1, 0.5 μg of E2-F1 (or UbcH5 when noted), and the indicated amounts of the various preparations of E3L (for the purification procedure of E3L, see below). Degradation reactions were carried out for 2 h at 37°C and conjugation assays for 30 min at the same temperature. Following incubation, reaction mixtures for monitoring conjugation were resolved via SDS-PAGE, and the gels were fluorographed, dried, and exposed to XAR-5 (Kodak) film or to an intensifying screen of a bioimaging analyzer (PhosphorImager; Fuji). Degradation of iodinated proteins was determined by measuring the radioactivity released into the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction as described(10.Blumenfeld N. Gonen H. Mayer A. Smith C.E. Siegel N.R. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9574-9581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant MyoD was purified from bacterial extracts as described (33.Bengal E. Flores O. Rangarajan P.N. Chen A. Weintraub H. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6221-6225Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and tested for conjugation by E1, E2-F1, and E3L as described above. High molecular weight ubiquitin-MyoD adducts were identified following separation on SDS-PAGE, transfer into nitrocellulose paper (Western blot), and detection with a rabbit polyclonal, affinity-purified anti-MyoD. Proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham). Fraction II was fractionated by (NH4)2SO4 into Fraction IIA (0-38%; see below). 2 ml of Fraction IIA (20 mg/ml) were loaded onto a HiLoad Superdex 200 HR gel filtration chromatography column, and the proteins were resolved in buffer A using an FPLC system. 2.4-ml fractions were collected and salt was removed by repeated concentration-dilution cycles using Centricon 30 microconcentrators and buffer B. Fractions were concentrated to 100 μl and activity was determined as described above, using 2-μl aliquots from the various column fractions as a source for E3L. Molecular mass of E3L was determined by separation of a set of molecular weight standard markers in the same column and under the same conditions. Chromatographic separations were carried out at 4°C and dialysis of samples at 0°C. E3L-containing fractions from the different purification steps were subjected to analysis of activity (stimulation of conjugation of 125I-lysozyme in the presence of E1 and E2-F1 as described above), quantitative protein determination, and Coomassie Blue staining following SDS-PAGE. Enzyme activity was expressed in units. One unit represents incorporation of 1% of radioactivity into conjugates/mg of protein as determined in the linear range of the reaction. Quantification was performed using PhosphorImager. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 38% to 300 ml of crude reticulocyte Fraction II (Fraction II contains ~15 mg/ml protein). Following stirring on ice for 30 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 28,000 × g for 15 min. The precipitate was dissolved in buffer B, and the proteins were reprecipitated in 38% ammonium sulfate. The pellet was dissolved in buffer B and dialyzed against the same buffer. ~1,350 mg of the ammonium sulfate-precipitated proteins (Fraction IIA) were loaded onto a 18 × 85 mm Resource Q column equilibrated in buffer B containing 200 mM KCl (buffer C) and connected to an FPLC system. Unadsorbed proteins were removed with 90 ml of buffer C, and the adsorbed proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of up to 600 mM KCl in buffer C. Following elution, all fractions were dialyzed against buffer B. All the conjugating activity adsorbed to the resin and eluted at 430-480 mM KCl (fractions 29-34). Fractions from the Resource Q column that contained activity of E3L were pooled, concentrated to 5 ml (a protein concentration of ~12.5 mg/ml), and loaded onto Sepharose 6B-CL column (25 × 500 mm) equilibrated with buffer A. 5-ml fractions were collected and tested for E3L activity and protein composition. Fractions obtained from the Sepharose column (protein eluted at ~550 kDa; ~18.5 mg) were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 20 mM NaPi, pH 7.4, 1 M ammonium sulfate, and 2 mM DTT (buffer D). The proteins were loaded onto an Econo-Pac HIC methyl cartridge equilibrated with buffer D. The adsorbed proteins were eluted by a 100-ml linear gradient of 1.0-0.0 M ammonium sulfate in 20 mM NaPi, pH 7.4, and 2 mM DTT. Following elution, all the fractions were dialyzed against Buffer B. Fractions 17-20 from the HIC methyl column (eluted at ~0.5 M ammonium sulfate), contained all the activity. This partially purified protein (~3.5 mg) was loaded onto an Econo-Pac HTP cartridge equilibrated against 10 mM KPi, pH 7.4, and 2 mM DTT. Elution of the adsorbed protein was carried out by a linear gradient of 10-600 mM KPi, pH 7.4, containing 2 mM DTT. The ligase activity was detected at ~350 mM KPi and coincided with a protein of ~270 kDa in the Coomassie staining. Dialyzed active fractions from the HTP column (~2 mg of protein) were purified further by an additional anion exchange step (Mono Q). The adsorbed proteins were eluted by a 0.2 M-0.7 M KCl gradient in buffer B. A sharp peak of activity was detected at ~0.5 M KCl in coincidence with an ~270-kDa protein in the Coomassie staining. Cross-linking of 125I-lysozyme to E3L and E3α was carried out essentially as described(29.Reiss Y. Kaim D. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2693-2698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained in a volume of 20 μl: 25 mM KPi, pH 7.4, 125I-lysozyme (~1 μg, 1 × 106 cpm), 10 μg of ovalbumin, ~3.0 microunits of E3α(29.Reiss Y. Kaim D. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2693-2698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or ~500 units of E3L (see above; it should be noted that activity of the two enzymes is expressed in different units). When indicated, 100 μg of unlabeled lysozyme was added prior to the addition of the labeled protein. Following incubation at 37°C for 5 min, the samples were chilled on ice, and 2 μl of 2 mM freshly dissolved bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce) were added. Following an additional incubation for 15 min at 0°C, the reaction was stopped with the addition of 2 μl of 1 M ethanolamine, pH 9. Samples were resolved via SDS-PAGE (6%), dried, and autoradiographed as described above. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method (34.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Lysozyme is an N-end rule (7.Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) type I (29.Reiss Y. Kaim D. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2693-2698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) substrate. It has a basic (Lys), “destabilizing” amino acid at the N-terminal position. The protein ligase E3α recognizes and binds such proteins and, in the presence of E1 and E2-14 kDa enzymes, catalyzes the addition of multiple molecules of ubiquitin to these substrates. It has been shown previously that the dipeptide Arg-Ala is a potent inhibitor of the type I binding site of E3α (binding of basic N-terminal residues). Addition of the inhibitor to ubiquitin-supplemented Fraction II completely abolished both conjugation and degradation of type I substrates(29.Reiss Y. Kaim D. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2693-2698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition is probably mediated via binding of the basic N-terminal peptide to the E3α binding site of the substrates. We noted that addition of the inhibitor to a complete lysate resulted only in partial inhibition of degradation of labeled lysozyme, whereas the inhibition in Fraction II was complete (Fig. 1A). We tested the hypothesis that a factor that is missing in the ubiquitin-supplemented Fraction II, probably E2-F1, is responsible for the Arg-Ala-resistant activity observed in the whole lysate. This E2 probably acts with a novel E3 enzyme, distinct from E3α. The ligase is inactive in ubiquitin-supplemented Fraction II because its cognate E2 is missing, and the activity observed in this partially resolved system is catalyzed solely by E2-14 kDa and E3α. Indeed, addition of E2-F1 to Fraction II in the presence"
https://openalex.org/W1534293194,"Thyrotropin (TSH) β is a subunit of TSH, the expression of which is limited to the thyrotrope cells of the anterior pituitary gland. We have utilized the thyrotrope-derived TtT-97 thyrotropic tumors to investigate tissue-specific expression of the TSHβ promoter. TSHβ promoter activity in thyrotropes is conferred by sequences between −270 and −80 of the 5′-flanking region. We have recently reported that the proximal region from −133 to −100 (P1) is required for promoter expression in thyrotropes. This region interacts with the pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1. While Pit-1 appears necessary for TSHβ promoter activity in thyrotropes, this transcription factor is not alone sufficient for promoter activity in pituitary-derived cells. In this report, we have generated a series of promoter mutations in the P1 region to identify additional protein-DNA interactions and determine their functional significance. We have found that Pit-1 interacts with the distal portion of the P1 region, and a second protein interacts with the proximal segment of this region. Each protein is able to independently interact with the TSHβ promoter, but neither alone can maintain promoter activity. Both proteins appear to be necessary for full promoter activity in thyrotropes. Southwestern analysis with the proximal segment of the P1 region (−117 to −88) reveals interaction with a 50-kDa protein. Interestingly, this protein is not found in the pituitary-derived GH3 cells and may represent a thyrotrope-specific transcription factor. Further characterization of this newly identified DNA-binding protein will further our understanding of the tissue-specific expression of the TSHβ gene.

Thyrotropin (TSH) 1The abbreviations used are: TSHthyrotropinTEFthyrotrope embryonic factorTRHthyrotropin-releasing hormone. is a glycoprotein hormone that is produced only by thyrotrope cells of the anterior pituitary gland(1.Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). TSH contains two dissimilar, noncovalently associated subunits: the α-subunit, which is shared among other glycoprotein hormones, and the β-subunit, which is functionally and immunologically unique and has expression limited to thyrotropes. Gene expression is affected by trans-acting factors that bind directly to cis-acting elements within promoter regions of specific genes(2.Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar). Transfection experiments in thyrotrope cells have shown that the cell-specific activity of the mouse TSHβ promoter is localized between −270 and −80 of the 5′-flanking region(3.Wood W.M. Kao M.Y.

DNase I protection studies using nuclear protein extracts from a TSHβ-expressing mouse thyrotropic tumor, TtT-97, have identified four cis-acting elements in the −270 to −80 region: D1 (−253 to −222), D2 (−196 to −176), P1 (−133 to −100) and P2 (−86 to −64)(4.Wood W.M.

Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 96: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Studies with the rat and human promoters suggested that the cognate D1 and P1 regions confer Pit-1-mediated stimulation with TRH and cAMP(8.Mason M.E. Friend K.E. Copper J.

Gordon D.F. Nelson A.R. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1574-1582PubMed Google Scholar). A mutation in this region, which disrupted Pit-1 binding, decreased basal promoter activity to a level seen with a promoter deletion to −80. While Pit-1 is necessary for basal activity of the TSHβ promoter in thyrotropes, it does not appear to be sufficient to stimulate promoter activity when transfected into cells that lack Pit-1(5.Gordon D.F.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1574-1582PubMed Google Scholar), stimulates the TSHβ promoter through the P1 region, but its role in cell-specific promoter activity is unclear. TEF is a member of the leucine zipper (bZIP) gene family of transcription factors(11.Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). TEF mRNA appears in the rat anterior pituitary gland on embryonic day 14, before TSHβ mRNA. TEF interacts with a region of the mouse TSHβ promoter which is similar to the D2 thyrotrope extract protected region of the mouse promoter (4.Wood W.M. Ocran K.W. Kao M.Y. Gordon D.F. Alexander L.M. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1897-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). TEF stimulates TSHβ promoter activity in CV-1 cells, but TEF mRNA expression in adult tissues is not restricted to thyrotropes, raising questions as to its role as a thyrotrope-specific transcription factor. Recently, a study of mouse pituitary development has shown that TEF may be responsible for the initiation of the thyrotrope phenotype, but Pit-1 and perhaps other factors are necessary for the persistence of mature thyrotropes(22.Lin S.-C. Li S. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 515-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mLIM-3 is a member of the LIM homeodomain family of transcription factors and appears to be pituitary-specific(23.Bach I.

They also showed that in combination with Pit-1, mLIM-3 stimulated mTSHβ promoter activity in CV-1 cells and interacted with the −120 to −60 region of the promoter in gel retardation assays. The P1 region of the mouse TSHβ promoter is necessary for cell-specific basal promoter activity and Pit-1, which interacts with this region, does not appear to be sufficient for full promoter activity observed in thyrotrope cells. We recently observed that the DNase I protected footprints in this region differed at the 3′ end between recombinant Pit-1 and the TtT-97 thyrotrope extract(20.Haugen B.R. Gordon D.F. Nelson A.R. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1574-1582PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that other thyrotrope proteins may be interacting with the mTSHβ promoter. Steinfelder et al.(7.Steinfelder H.J. Radovick S. McClaskey J.H. Weintraub B.D. Wondisford F.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a human TSHβ promoter fragment (−128 to −61) yeilded five distinct protein-DNA complexes with a thyrotrope extract by gel mobility shift analysis. None of these complexes were seen using non-pituitary HeLa cell extract. Furthermore, they proved that four of these complexes contained Pit-1 and one complex appeared to be due to an unrelated thyrotrope protein. These data suggest that more than one protein may be interacting with the TSHβ promoter in this functionally critical region. In this report, we have undertaken a detailed mutagenesis analysis of the P1 region and identified a second protein that interacts with the proximal portion of this region and appears to be necessary for basal activity of the mTSHβ promoter in thyrotropes. Nuclear extracts were prepared from TtT-97 thyrotropic tumors, αTSH and GH3 cells as described previously(25.Ocran K.W. Sarapura V.D. Wood W.M. Gordon D.F. GutierrezHartmann A. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The −392 to +40 mTSHβ promoter fragment was excised from pGEM7zf+ with EcoRI and Mlu1 and gel-purified. The fragment was selectively labeled at the EcoRI end (+40 position) with reverse transcriptase using [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dTTP. DNase I protection assays were carried out as described previously(20.Haugen B.R. Gordon D.F. Nelson A.R. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1574-1582PubMed Google Scholar). 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, 120 μg of recombinant glutathione S-transferase/rPit-1 fusion protein bacterial extract(10.Haugen B.R. Wood W.M. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20818-20824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 75 μg of TtT-97 or 60 μg of GH3 nuclear protein extract were used for the various assays. Site-directed mutagenesis of the P1 region extending from −133 to −86 was carried out in the context of the −392 to +40 mTSHβ promoter region in pSELECT (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously(20.Haugen B.R. Gordon D.F. Nelson A.R. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1574-1582PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, for each mutated segment a 30-base pair oligonucleotide was generated with 4-6 altered bases in the center. Mutagenesis was carried out with the Altered Sites System (Promega). The −392 to +40 fragment was then excised with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into pGEM7zf+ and pA3luc (3.Wood W.M. Kao M.Y. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. CHem. 1989; 264: 14840-14847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for DNase I protection analysis and gene transfer studies, respectively. Sequences were verified in each plasmid by the chain termination method of Sanger(26.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (51992) Google Scholar). Wild-type mTSHβ promoter sequence and respective mutations are noted in Fig. 1. Transient transfection assays in TtT-97 thyrotropic tumor cells have been outlined previously(3.Wood W.M. Kao M.Y. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. CHem. 1989; 264: 14840-14847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of the various TSHβ promoter-luciferase plasmids and 1 μg of pCMVβgal as an internal control for transfection efficiency were co-transfected by electroporation into 5-10 million TtT-97 cells. Cells were incubated in 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with charcoal-stripped 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37°C for 18 h. Cells were harvested, subjected to freeze-thaw extraction, and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity as described previously(10.Haugen B.R. Wood W.M. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20818-20824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was corrected for β-galactosidase activity as an internal control for efficiency of each transfection. Statistical analysis was performed by one way analysis of variance. Pairwise multiple comparisons were made by the Student-Newman-Keuls test(27.Snedecor G.W. Cochran W.G. Statistical Methods. Iowa State University Press, Ames, IA1980Google Scholar). Southwestern blot analysis was carried out as described previously(5.Gordon D.F. Haugen B.R. Sarapura V.D.S. Nelson A.R. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 96: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extract proteins (approximately 50 μg) were separated on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel. After electrotransfer, nitrocellulose filters were treated with guanidine hydrochloride to renature the proteins, then treated with a solution containing 5% non-fat dry milk and 1% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific interactions with the labeled probe. Binding reactions were carried out with a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe (3 × 106 cpm/ml) corresponding to the wild-type or M7 mutation equivalent −117 to −88 region of the TSHβ promoter in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% non-fat milk, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 200 μM ZnSO4, and 10 μg/ml each of native and denatured salmon testes DNA. Binding reactions were carried out overnight at 4°C. Filters were washed twice for 20 min at 4°C in binding buffer minus salmon testes DNA and autoradiographic exposures were carried out at −70°C overnight. We first compared protein-DNA interaction of recombinant Pit-1 protein, TtT-97, and GH3 nuclear extracts with an expanded region of the TSHβ promoter from −390 to +40 (Fig. 2A). The 5′ (distal) extent of the P1 footprint appears to be identical between Pit-1 and the nuclear extracts. The 3′ (proximal) end, however, shows a clear extension of approximately 14 base pairs with the TtT-97 nuclear extract (lane 4) which is not seen with the recombinant Pit-1 protein (lane 3). This extension is similar in two nuclear extract preparations from two different TtT-97 thyrotrope tumors and redefines the P1 region to be −133 to −86. Interestingly, this footprint extension is not seen using an extract from the pituitary-derived, non-thyrotrope GH3 cells (lane 5) which suggests that factor(s) involved in this extension are thyrotrope-specific. The other regions of the TSHβ promoter are also redefined as D1 (−295 to −222), D2 (−196 to −170), and P2 (−80 to −62) using the TtT-97 nuclear protein extract. A new region D0 (−330 to −300) is also noted, which is protected by TtT-97 extract but not recombinant Pit-1 protein or GH3 nuclear extract. Fig. 2B shows DNase I protection with recombinant Pit-1 and TtT-97 extract protein on the eight different P1 region mutations. Mutations P1M1, P1M2, P1M6, and P1M8 appeared to have no effect on either Pit-1 or TtT-97 protein binding. In contrast, mutations P1M3 and P1M4 disrupted recombinant Pit-1 binding as well as the distal portion of the footprint generated with TtT-97 extract, but the proximal P1-protected region (PP-1) was preserved with the TtT-97 extract only, suggesting that a protein other than Pit-1 in the thyrotrope nuclear extract interacts with the proximal portion of the P1 region. The P1M5 mutation abrogated binding of Pit-1 and TtT-97 extract. This mutation corresponds to a previously reported random mutation (20.Haugen B.R. Gordon D.F. Nelson A.R. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1574-1582PubMed Google Scholar) which also disrupted Pit-1 and TtT-97 extract binding. The P1M7 mutation disrupted binding of TtT-97 extract to the proximal P1 region (PP-1), but this mutation had no effect on Pit-1 binding or the binding of Pit-1 in the TtT-97 extract. These data suggest that two separate thyrotrope proteins interact with the P1 region of the mTSHβ promoter and that each protein interacts independently of the other. In order to evaluate the functional effect of the P1 region TSHβ promoter mutations in thyrotropes, we transiently transfected luciferase reporter plasmids containing the wild-type and mutated promoters within the context of the −390 to +40 region into TtT-97 cells. Results of the various mutant promoter activities compared with wild-type are shown in Fig. 3. The activity of a −80 to +40 TSHβ promoter plasmid, which lacks the P1 region is shown for comparison. All of the mutations affect activity of the TSHβ promoter in TtT-97 cells, which may reflect a greater sensitivity of these mutations in a functional assay compared with the protein-DNA interaction data displayed in Fig. 2B. However, the relative promoter activity of the mutants appears to mirror the ability of proteins to interact with this region. The P1M1 and P1M2 mutations, which do not affect protein interaction, show modest decreases of promoter activity (24 and 29% decrease, respectively) compared with the wild-type promoter. The P1M3 and P1M4 mutations, which disrupt binding of Pit-1 but not the protein to the proximal region (PP-1), greatly reduce promoter activity 70 and 72%, respectively. The P1M5 mutation interferes with interaction of both proteins and reduces activity 63%. Interestingly, the P1M6 mutation, which is well within the P1 region, does not affect protein-DNA interaction. Promoter function is modestly affected (38% decrease) which is significantly different than the M3, M4, and M5 mutations (p < 0.05). The P1M7 mutation is the only mutation that interferes with interaction in the PP-1 region and not Pit-1, and its promoter activity is profoundly reduced by 78% compared with the wild-type promoter. This reduction is equivalent to that seen with a deletion of the entire P1 region (−80 deletion, Fig. 2B). Finally, the P1M8 mutation does not appear to affect protein-DNA interaction. Functionally, however, promoter activity is moderately reduced by 43%. This data may reflect the differences in sensitivity between the functional and protein-DNA interaction assays. Yet this activity is significantly different than the reductions seen by the mutations which interfere with protein-DNA interactions (M3, M4, M5, M7) (p < 0.05). These data suggest that protein-DNA binding and promoter function correlate in this system and interaction of each protein with the P1 region is necessary for activity of the TSHβ promoter and that Pit-1 or the other thyrotrope protein(s) alone is not sufficient to mediate this basal activity in thyrotropes. To determine whether other proteins in thyrotrope nuclear extracts directly interact with the PP-1 region of the TSHβ promoter, we performed Southwestern blot analysis of thyrotrope-derived TtT-97 nuclear extracts, as well as somatotrope-derived GH3 nuclear extracts which did not protect the proximal extension of the P1 region and thyrotrope-derived αTSH nuclear extracts which lack Pit-1 protein (5.Gordon D.F. Haugen B.R. Sarapura V.D.S. Nelson A.R. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 96: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A duplexed oligonucleotide lacking the Pit-1 binding region (−117 to −88) interacted with a 50-kDa protein in the thyrotrope-derived TtT-97 and aTSH nuclear extracts, but not the somatotrope-derived GH3 nuclear extract (Fig. 4, lanes 1-3). As expected, recombinant Pit-1 protein (31-33 kDa) did not interact with this oligonucleotide (data not shown). A duplexed oligoucleotide (−117 to −88) with changes corresponding to the M7 mutation (Fig. 1) did not interact with the 50-kDa protein (Fig. 5, lanes 4-6), suggesting that this protein is involved in TSHβ promoter activity in thyrotropes. In this report we have used mutagenesis, DNA footprinting, and gene transfer studies to dissect the functionally important P1 region of the mTSHβ promoter. These results strongly suggest that more than one protein interacts within this region, a predictable conclusion when one considers the size of the native thyrotrope-derived footprint (47 base pairs). Many lines of evidence indicate that the pituitary transcription factor Pit-1 or one of its isoforms is one of the factors that interacts with this region and appears necessary for activation of the TSHβ promoter. Pit-1 interacts with three regions in the −390 to +40 segment of the mTSHβ promoter which confers cell-specific activity, D1 (−295 to −222), P1 (−133 to −86), and P2 (−80 to −62) ((5.Gordon D.F. Haugen B.R. Sarapura V.D.S. Nelson A.R. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 96: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), Fig. 2A). Several reports have shown that Pit-1 is necessary for TRH- and cAMP-mediated stimulation of the TSHβ promoter, occurring through the D1- and P1-related regions in the rat and human promoters respectively(6.Steinfelder H.J.

Steinfelder et al.(19.Steinfelder H.J. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5942-5945Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) observed that mutations of either Pit-1 site in the P1 equivalent region of the hTSHβ promoter reduced activity by approximately 50% in GH3 cells, while forskolin and TRH stimulation was reduced by more than 60% in the upstream Pit-1 site (P1M3 equivalent) and only 20-30% in the downstream site (P1M6 equivalent). Lin and colleagues (22.Lin S.-C. Li S. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 515-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mutated two putative Pit-1 binding sites, the P1M3 equivalent at −122 to −116 and a proximal site at −76 to −69. This double mutant promoter was no longer stimulated by Pit-1 in CV-1 cells. Basal activity in pituitary-derived cells was not studied. We have recently shown that a mutation in the P1 region of the mTSHβ promoter, which disrupted Pit-1 binding, abrogated basal activity of the promoter in TtT-97 thyrotropes, but had no effect in GH3 somatotropes(20.Haugen B.R.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1574-1582PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that both Pit-1 and the P1 region are necessary for cell-specific basal activity of the mTSHβ promoter only in thyrotropes. However, introduction by gene transfer of Pit-1 into various Pit-1-deficient cell types has little or no effect on TSHβ promoter activity(5.Gordon D.F. Haugen B.R. Sarapura V.D.S. Nelson A.R.

Science. 1992; 257: 1115-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), indicating that while Pit-1 may be necessary for TSHβ promoter activity, it is not sufficient for promoter activity. In this study, we have identified a segment of the P1 region, the proximal P1 region (PP-1), which interacts with a non-Pit-1 protein and is separately and equally critical to the region that interacts with Pit-1 for activity of the mTSHβ promoter in thyrotropes. Systematic scanning mutagenesis of this region has revealed separate contact areas for these two distinct proteins. While all of the mutations affected promoter activity in thyrotropes, they appeared to segregate into mutations which did not affect protein-DNA interactions (less than 45% reduction in activity) and mutations which disrupted binding (greater than 60% reduction). The reduction of promoter activity seen with mutations that did not affect protein-DNA interactions may reflect sensitivity differences between functional and structural assays. P1M1 and P1M2 mutations (Fig. 1) appear to have little effect on protein binding and modest decreased function of the mTSHβ promoter. Interestingly, the P1M2 mutation changes the final T to a G in the Pit-1 binding site AATNCAT. P1M3 and P1M4 mutations both affect Pit-1 interaction with the P1 region, but do not alter protein binding at the PP-1 region. These mutations cause a greater reduction in basal activity of the mTSHβ promoter than the mutations which do not affect protein-DNA interaction. The P1M3 mutation significantly alters the Pit-1 binding sequence, while the P1M4 mutation does not directly alter this sequence but creates changes seen with a previously described mutation (20.Haugen B.R. Gordon D.F. Nelson A.R. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1574-1582PubMed Google Scholar) that also affected Pit-1 interaction with the promoter. The P1M4 mutation does change the AA preceeding the Pit-1 binding site to CC. This A/T-rich region preceeding the core binding site is necessary for high-affinity Pit-1 interaction as well as promoter function(20.Haugen B.R. Gordon D.F. Nelson A.R. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1574-1582PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Theill L.E. Karin M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 670-689PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Iverson R.A. Day K.H. d'Emden M. Day R.N. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1564-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The P1M5 mutation appears to alter interaction of both proteins with the promoter. Promoter activity is reduced greater than 60%, but not to the level seen with the M3, M4, and M7 mutations which disrupt individual protein binding. It appears that this mutation affects binding of both proteins, but Dnase I protection (Fig. 2B) shows that Pit-1 and TtT-97 footprints are slightly different than the bovine serum albumin control and may reflect partial protein-DNA interaction. Surprisingly, the P1M6 mutation, while altering a putative Pit-1 binding sequence (AAANCAT), has no effect on protein-DNA interaction and modestly affects promoter function. This data implies that the upstream Pit-1 binding element is the critical element for protein-DNA interaction. The P1M7 mutation does not affect Pit-1 interaction with the promoter, but the novel protein no longer binds to the PP-1 region. This is the only mutation that affects binding in the PP-1 region and yet does not alter Pit-1 interaction with the promoter. Basal activity of the promoter is greatly reduced by this mutation, suggesting that the two factors can interact with the promoter independently of binding by the other, but both are necessary for full basal activity of the promoter. These systematic mutations clearly illustrate that two separate proteins are interacting at overlapping regions on the mTSHβ promoter and that neither factor alone is capable of conferring full promoter activity in thyrotropes. Identification of the factor that interacts with the PP-1 region, and the nature of its functional interaction with Pit-1 will greatly increase our understanding of thyrotrope-specific activity of the TSHβ promoter. Using Southwestern blot analysis with a duplex oligonucleotide corresponding to the PP-1 segment of the P1 region (−117 to −88), we have shown that a 50-kDa protein in thyrotrope-derived cells interacts with this region. Examination of the sequence in this PP-1 region reveals an AGATAA motif at −98 to −93. The M7 mutation (Fig. 1), which disrupts this AGATAA sequence, abrogates both functional and structural interaction of the TSHβ promoter and the 50-kDa protein. This sequence resembles a consensus binding site for the GATA family of transcription factors designated as GATA-1 through GATA-6(31.Orkin S.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 33.Ko L.J. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell.

Steger et al.(34.Steger D.J. Hecht J.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5592-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the pituitary-derived αT3-1 gonadotrope cell line contains mRNA for mGATA-2 as well as an mGATA-4 related factor, which has a different message size than the previously reported mGATA-4(35.Arceci R. King A.A.J. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They also demonstrated by gel mobility shift analysis that two proteins interacted with a human α-subunit gene GATA-containing element (−224 to −97), and a mutation of this GATA element decreased transcriptional activity of the α-subunit promoter 2.5-fold in αT3-1 cells. In this report, we show that a mutation of this GATA element (M7) reduces transcriptional activity of the TSHβ promoter 5-fold in thyrotropes. Since the proximal portion of the P1 element in the mTSHβ promoter contains this consensus AGATAA sequence, and GATA proteins are present in pituitary-derived cell lines, a GATA-related protein may be present in thyrotropes and involved in expression of the TSHβ gene in thyrotropes. Furthermore, the 50-kDa protein identified by Southwestern blot analysis is consistent with sizes of GATA factors reported previously(34.Steger D.J. Hecht J.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5592-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two groups have recently described another homeodomain transcription factor, mLIM-3 (24.Seidah N.G. Barale J.C. Marcinkiewicz M. Mattei M.G.

This transcription factor mRNA has been identified in adult mouse pituitary as well as pituitary-derived GH3, GH4C1, and αT3 cell lines(24.Seidah N.G. Barale J.C. Marcinkiewicz M. Mattei M.G. Day R. Chretien M. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1163-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the developing mouse pituitary, detection of mRNA for mLIM-3 was coincident with the appearance of Rathke's pouch at embryonic day 9 (e9)(23.Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse II, R.V. Heinzel T. Gloss B.

In the adult mouse, mRNA was confined to the anterior pituitary gland and neurointermediate lobe and not in other areas of the brain or the liver(23.Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse II, R.V. Heinzel T.

While mLIM-3 alone did not stimulate the TSHβ promoter, the combination of Pit-1 and mLIM-3 cooperatively stimulated the promoter (50-fold) greater than Pit-1 alone (10-fold). However, mLIM-3 alone stimulated the α-subunit promoter. They extended their studies to protein-DNA interaction which showed that a truncated version of mLIM-3 interacted with the −120 to −60 region of the mTSHβ promoter, but the full-length protein did not. The −120 to −60 region of the mTSHβ promoter contains the proximal portion of the P1 footprint (−133 to −98) as well as the P2 footprint (−86 to −64). Both of these regions are AT-rich and could conceivably interact with a homeodomain protein such as mLIM-3. mLIM-3 is reported to contain 400 amino acids and has a predicted protein size of 50 kDa. Interestingly, both groups reported that mLIM-3 mRNA was present in GH3 cells, and our data indicate that the 50-kDa protein is not present in GH3 cells by footprint or Southwestern blot analysis. This suggests that the 50-kDa protein we have identified is unlikely to be mLIM-3. Therefore, mLIM-3 may be interacting with the mTSHβ promoter in the P2 region. Alternatively, mLIM-3 protein may not be sufficiently expressed in GH3 cells to be detectable by footprint or Southwestern blot analysis. In summary, we have identified a 50-kDa protein in thyrotropes that appears to be necessary for basal activity of the mTSHβ promoter. Further characterization of this factor will lead to a better understanding of TSHβ gene regulation and cell-specific gene expression.

Autocrine stimulation of multiple G protein-coupled neuropeptide receptor systems contributes to the transformed growth of SCLC. The ability of neuropeptide receptors to stimulate phospholipase C and mobilize intracellular Ca2+ indicates that Gq family members of heterotrimeric G proteins are a convergence point mediating autocrine signaling by multiple neuropeptides in SCLC. Expression of a GTPase-deficient, constitutive active form of an αq family member, α16Q212L, in SCLC markedly inhibited growth of the cells in soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice. SCLC lines expressing α16Q212L exhibited 2-4-fold elevated basal phospholipase C activity, but neuropeptide and hormone-regulated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was nearly abolished. The data suggest that Ca2+ mobilization is an obligatory signal in neuropeptide-stimulated growth of SCLC. In addition, the proline-directed c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases/stress-activated protein kinases, which are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, were stimulated ~2-fold in parental SCLC in response to exogenous neuropeptides and muscarinic agonists and were constitutively activated to the same degree in α16Q212L-expressing SCLC. Thus, α16Q212L expression induced desensitization of neuropeptide-stimulated Ca2+ signaling and persistent activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway. We propose that the induction of discordant signaling by selective perturbation of receptor-regulated effector systems leads to the inhibition of SCLC cell growth.

Although the repertoire of G proteins potentially involved in neuropeptide signaling in SCLC is quite large, the failure of pertussis toxin to appreciably inhibit in vitro growth of SCLC (9.Viallet J.

In fact, the prominence of phospholipase C activation and Ca2+ mobilization (10.Trepel J.B. Moyer J.D. Heikkila R. Sausville E.A. Biochem.

To examine the role of Gq proteins in SCLC growth pathways, we have used retrovirus-mediated gene transfer to express a GTPase-deficient, constitutively active form of the αq family member, Gα16, in SCLC lines. We find that expression of GTPase-deficient Gα16 in SCLC markedly inhibits their growth and oppositely affected two signal transduction pathways normally engaged by neuropeptides and muscarinic agonists in SCLC; Ca2+ mobilization was inhibited, and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway was constitutively activated. The data indicate that derangement of coordinated neuropeptide signaling in SCLC leads to strong inhibition of growth. The PA317 packaging cell line (15.Miller A.D. Buttimore C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar) was infected with ecotropic retrovirus secreted from GP+E-86 cell lines (16.Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A.J. Virology. 1988; 62: 1120-1124Crossref Google Scholar) that had been stably transfected with LNCX or LNCX-α16Q212L(17.Qian N.-X. Russell M. Buhl A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17417-17423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following selection in G418, individual PA317 clones were screened for expression of α16Q212L polypeptide by immunoblotting. The PA317 packaging cell lines expressing LNCX or LNCX-α16Q212L were allowed to secrete virus into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 16-24 h. The medium was collected, supplemented with 8 μg/ml polybrene, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and incubated undiluted with the indicated lung cancer cell lines for 16-24 h. The next day, the virus-containing medium was removed from the lung cancer cells and replaced with fresh virus for another 16-24 h. Following the second virus exposure, the lung cancer cell lines were placed in their normal growth medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml G418. SCLC cell lines H345 and H1048 were cultured in HITES (RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 nM hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 10 nM 17β-estradiol, 30 nM sodium selenite, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin), and SCLC cell lines H69 and N417 and NSCLC lines H157 and H2122 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The studies described herein were performed with pooled populations of G418-resistant cells. The indicated lung cancer cell lines were collected in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100. Following a 5-min microcentrifugation (10,000 × g), soluble proteins (100 μg) were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose, and probed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-α16 antiserum(17.Qian N.-X. Russell M. Buhl A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17417-17423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immobilized antibodies were visualized with 125I-protein A and autoradiography. Single cell suspensions of the nonadherent SCLC cell lines were prepared by passage through a 20 guage syringe needle (H69, H345, N417, and H1048) or mild trypsinization of the adherent NSCLC lines (H157 and H2122). The cells were counted with a hemacytometer and 10,000 cells (H345, N417, H157, and H2122) or 25,000 cells (H69 and H1048) were diluted in 1.5 ml of growth medium containing 0.3% agar nobel (Difco) and plated in triplicate on a 2-ml base of growth medium containing 0.5% agar nobel in 35-mm wells of six-well plates. The plates were placed in a humidified CO2 incubator, and the colonies were counted after 3-4 weeks with a microscope using a 4× objective. The SCLC lines infected with LNCX or LNCX-α16Q212Lwere incubated for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1 μCi/ml [3H]inositol. The NSCLC lines were incubated in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 μCi/ml [3H]inositol due to low uptake and incorporation of inositol by these lines relative to the SCLC lines. The cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and once with the same containing 20 mM LiCl. The cells were then incubated in 1 ml of medium containing 20 mM LiCl for 30 min at 37°C, quenched with 2 ml of MeOH:HCl (100:1), 1 ml of distilled water, and 2 ml of CHCl3, and total inositol phosphates in the aqueous phase were purified by ion exchange chromatography as described previously(18.Gupta S.K. Diez E. Heasley L.E. Osawa S. Johnson G.L. Science. 1990; 249: 662-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Plateau phase H345 and H1048 cells infected with LNCX or LNCX-α16Q212L in HITES medium were washed, and single cell suspensions were prepared. The cells were loaded with the calcium indicator Indo-1 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described(12.Bunn Jr., P.A. Chan D. Dienhart D.G. Tolley R. Tagawa M. Jewett P.B.

The changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels were determined with an EPICS752 cell sorter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL) by quantitating the ratio of fluorescence at 410-490 nm using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm. Plateau phase H345 cells expressing α16Q212L or the empty LNCX vector were collected by centrifugation (5 min, 1000 × g) and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml aprotinin). In addition, H345 cells expressing the empty vector were incubated (37°C) for 10 min with 100 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, collected by centrifugation and lysed as described above. Following a 5-min centrifugation (10,000 × g) to remove nuclei and cell debris, portions of the soluble extracts (0.5 ml, 1 mg protein) were applied to a Pharmacia HR5/5 MonoQ column equilibrated in 50 mM β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol and eluted with a 30-ml gradient of 0-350 mM NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and assayed for MAP kinase activity with EGFR662-681 peptide(20.Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Aliquots (20 μl) of the fractionated extracts were mixed with 20 μl of 50 mM β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, 20 mM MgCl2, 200 μM [γ-32P]ATP (5000 cpm/pmol), 50 μg/ml IP-20 (TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD), 1 mM EGTA, and 400 μM EGFR662-681 peptide (RRELVEPLTPSGEAPNQALLR). The kinase reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30°C and terminated with 10 μl of 25% trichloroacetic acid, and EGFR662-681 peptide phosphorylation was assessed by binding to phosphocellulose filters as described(20.Heasley L.E.

Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). SCLC cells were collected by centrifugation (5 min, 1000 × g) and lysed (4°C, 30 min) in 0.5 ml of 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.7), 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml aprotinin. Following a 5-min microcentrifugation (10,000 × g), aliquots of the soluble extracts containing 400 μg of protein were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with GST-c-Jun(1-79) adsorbed to glutathione-agarose as described(21.Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). The GST-c-Jun(1-79) beads were washed four times by repetitive centrifugation in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.7), 50 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100 and then incubated for 20 min at 30°C in 40 μl of 50 mM β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.6), 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, 10 mM MgCl2, and 20 μM [γ-32P]ATP (25,000 cpm/pmol). The reactions were terminated with 10 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled, and submitted to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The GST-c-Jun(1-79) polypeptides were identified in Coomassie-stained gels, excised, and counted in a scintillation counter. To test the role of Gq family members in SCLC growth, we analyzed the effects of expression of GTPase-deficient forms of αq family members on neuropeptide-stimulated signaling and growth in SCLC lines. We have previously used retrovirus-mediated gene transfer as a standard method to express exogenous gene products in many different cell lines(17.Qian N.-X. Russell M. Buhl A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17417-17423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, repeated attempts to establish a stable PA317 retroviral packaging line expressing the GTPase-deficient form of αq (αqQ209L) failed, suggesting that the αqQ209L polypeptide was cytotoxic in these lines and did not permit retroviral packaging. Subsequent attempts with the GTPase-deficient form of the αq family member, α16Q212L, were successful such that a stable PA317 retroviral packaging line that secreted virus encoding the α16Q212L polypeptide was established. Retrovirus encoding the α16Q212L polypeptide as well as the vector, LNCX, lacking a cDNA insert were used to infect four SCLC lines (H69, H345, N417, and H1048) as well as two NSCLC cell lines (H157 and H2122). Stable populations of tumor cells were selected for resistance to G418. Immunoblotting with an α16-specific antibody verified that an α16 polypeptide was indeed expressed in the α16Q212L-transfected lines (Fig. 1A) relative to the LNCX-transfected controls. The lung cancer cell lines lack detectable endogenous α16 because it is normally restricted in expression to cells of hematopoetic origin(22.Amatruda III, T.T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As predicted for an αq family member, expression of the α16Q212L polypeptide in the SCLC and NSCLC lines persistently stimulated phospholipase C activity as shown by the 2-4-fold increase in total inositol phosphate content observed in the α16Q212L-expressing cells relative to the LNCX-transfected lines (Fig. 1B). Expression of the α16Q212L polypeptide in the H1048 line, a small cell carcinoma of extrapulmonary origin(23.Johnson B.E. Whang-Peng J. Naylor S.L. Zbar B.B. Brauch H. Lee E. Simmons A. Russell E. Nam M.H. Gazdar A.F. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1989; 81: 1223-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), stimulated basal phospholipase C activity at least 10-fold. Repeated attempts to stably express α16Q212L in another extrapulmonary small cell line (H510) failed, suggesting that small cell carcinomas of extrapulmonary origin may be particularly sensitive to α16Q212L. Thus, the data show that α16Q212L was functionally expressed in SCLC and NSCLC lines and constitutively activated phospholipase C activity. Colony formation in semi-solid medium was used to monitor the transformed phenotype of SCLC and NSCLC expressing α16Q212L. The ability of the α16Q212L-expressing SCLC to form colonies in soft agar was inhibited approximately 70% respective to lines infected with the vector containing no cDNA insert (Fig. 2). In contrast, α16Q212L expression did not influence the growth of two NSCLC lines (H157 and H2122). Note that the absolute cloning efficiency of the different lung cancer cell lines varied considerably, although the percentage of inhibition of soft agar cloning efficiency by α16Q212L was similar. The soft agar cloning efficiencies of H345 cells expressing GTPase-deficient forms of αi2 and αo were 96 and 139%, respectively, of the cloning efficiency of H345 cells infected with LNCX (data not shown), indicating that inhibition of SCLC growth is specific for the αq family members. This finding is consistent with the inability of pertussis toxin to significantly stimulate or inhibit the in vitro growth of SCLC lines(9.Viallet J. Sharoni Y. Frucht H. Jensen R.T. Minna J.D. Sausville E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1904-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As a more stringent indicator of the transformed growth properties of SCLC lines expressing α16Q212L, the H1048 lines infected with LNCX or α16Q212L were implanted in the flanks of nude mice. Of the three mice injected with H1048-LNCX cells (107 cells per mouse), all formed large tumors after 6-8 weeks. In contrast, none of the three mice injected with H1048-α16Q212L cells developed tumors within 8 weeks. Thus, expression of α16Q212L in SCLC but not NSCLC significantly inhibited their in vitro and in vivo growth properties. To define the mechanism by which α16Q212L inhibits SCLC growth, the influence of α16Q212L expression on neuropeptide signaling was examined. A prominent indicator of neuropeptide signaling in SCLC is intracellular Ca2+ mobilization(10.Trepel J.B. Moyer J.D. Heikkila R. Sausville E.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11.Woll P.J. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 12.Bunn Jr., P.A. Chan D. Dienhart D.G. Tolley R. Tagawa M. Jewett P.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 24-31PubMed Google Scholar), which can be readily detected by changes in fluorescence of the Ca2+-sensitive dye, Indo-1. The H1048 and H345 SCLC lines infected with the LNCX vector alone show marked Ca2+ responses following exposure to exogenous cholecystokinin (Fig. 3A) and the muscarinic agonist, carbachol (Fig. 3C), respectively. The H1048-LNCX cells also exhibit a measurable Ca2+ mobilization response to bradykinin (Fig. 3B). The H1048 and H345 SCLC lines expressing α16Q212L exhibited markedly blunted Ca2+ mobilization responses following application of cholecystokinin, bradykinin, and carbachol. The data are consistent with a mechanism whereby α16Q212L expression desensitizes hormone and neuropeptide-regulated Ca2+ mobilization in a heterologous fashion. Previously, workers have shown that chronic activation of phospholipase Cβ systems induces desensitization or down-regulation of the the inositol trisphosphate-gated Ca2+ channel in the endoplasmic reticulum (24.Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as induction of polyphosphatidyinositol phosphatases. 2Lobaugh, L. A., Eisfelder, B., Johnson, G. L., and Putney, J. W., Jr., submitted for publication. Besides a blunted growth rate, SCLC H345 cells expressing α16Q212L are significantly increased in cell size relative to LNCX-infected controls. In addition, both H345 and H1048 exhibited increased adherence to tissue culture plastic upon expression of α16Q212L. Thus, expression of α16Q212L alters the morphologic properties of some of the SCLC lines. Interestingly, a rat neuroendocrine tumor cell line, PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, undergoes marked growth arrest and neuronal differentiation upon introduction of α16Q212L by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. 3L. E. Heasley, B. Storey, and J. Zamarripa, unpublished results. The inhibition of SCLC growth observed with α16Q212L expression is likely to be related, at least in part, to loss of Ca2+ signaling, indicating that the Ca2+ mobilization is a major mitogenic signal in SCLC. However, it seemed possible that additional signal pathways involved in regulation of growth and differentiation were being regulated in response to expression of α16Q212L, especially in relation to altered cellular morphology. The activity of the p42/44 MAP kinases was assessed because they have been previously shown to be persistently stimulated in morphologically differentiated PC12 cells(20.Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Extracts from LNCX and α16Q212L-expressing H345 cells were fractionated on MonoQ fast protein liquid chromatography and analyzed for MAP kinase activity with an EGFR662-681 peptide phosphorylation assay. The data in Fig. 4 reveal that increased p42/44 MAP kinase activity relative to control cell extracts was not observed in fractionated extracts from α16Q212L-expressing H345 cells. In addition, incubation of the various SCLC lines with neuropeptides including bombesin and vasopressin failed to significantly stimulate p42/44 MAP kinase activity (data not shown), although treatment of H345 cells with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate markedly increased MAP kinase activity (Fig. 4). The recently defined c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases or stress-activated protein kinases are members of the MAP kinase family that exhibit homology to the p42/44 MAP kinases (26.Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar, 27.Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmed M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar) and are strongly activated by exposure to heat shock and ultraviolet light (21.Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). Analysis of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activity using an immobilized GST-c-Jun(1-79) assay revealed a statistically significant 1.8-fold increase in c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase activity in extracts from H345 cells expressing α16Q212L relative to control cells (Fig. 5A). The magnitude of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation by α16Q212L is similar to the level of activation observed in response to acute treatment of H345 cells with a neuropeptide, bombesin, or a muscarinic agonist, carbachol (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activity is strongly stimulated (~10-fold) by exposure of H345 cells to ultraviolet irradiation (UV-C, 96 J/M2), but not by strong activation of protein kinase C with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (Fig. 5C) that leads to marked p42/44 MAP kinase activation (Fig. 4). Thus, the findings demonstrate a significant activation of protein kinases characteristic of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases/stress-activated protein kinases but not the p42/44 MAP kinases following expression of α16Q212L in a SCLC line. Elevated cAMP and activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase are growth inhibitory in many cell systems. It has been previously established that expression of α16Q212L in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts significantly stimulates cAMP-dependent protein kinase through a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism(17.Qian N.-X. Russell M. Buhl A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17417-17423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a finding that may be partially responsible for the growth inhibition observed in Swiss 3T3 cells. However, the basal activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in α16Q212L-expressing H345 and H69 cells was 85 and 117% of LNCX-expressing H345 and H69 cells, respectively, indicating that the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway is not involved in the α16Q212L-induced growth inhibition observed in SCLC lines. The results show that cellular expression of α16Q212L inhibits the growth of SCLC but not NSCLC. The selective inhibition of SCLC growth relative to NSCLC growth is likely to be explained by the different cellular pathways that exert dominance in growth regulation in the two lung cancer cell types. Oncogenic activation of Ras is frequently observed in NSCLC. In fact, H157, a squamous cell carcinoma, and H2122, an adenocarcinoma, have been previously shown to express mutated forms of Ki-Ras(28.Mitsudomi T. Viallet J. Mulshine J.L. Linnoila R.I. Minna J.D. Gazdar A.F. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1353-1362PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, NSCLC frequently overexpress specific receptor tyrosine kinase systems such as the epidermal growth factor receptor(29.Cerny T. Barnes D.M. Hasleton P. Barber P.V. Healy K. Gullick W. Thatcher N. Br. J. Cancer. 1986; 54: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast, SCLC is characterized by the notable absence of GTPase-deficient forms of Ras, and overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptors is rare(28.Mitsudomi T. Viallet J. Mulshine J.L. Linnoila R.I. Minna J.D. Gazdar A.F. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1353-1362PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Cerny T. Barnes D.M. Hasleton P. Barber P.V. Healy K. Gullick W. Thatcher N. Br. J. Cancer. 1986; 54: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Instead, neuropeptide autocrine loops utilizing seven membrane-spanning receptors and heterotrimeric G proteins are proposed to be the primary mitogenic inputs in SCLC. Previous findings that αqQ209L expression in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts leads to cellular transformation (30.Kalinec G. Nagaradi A.J. Hermouet S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4687-4693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.DeVivo M. Chen J. Codina J. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18263-18266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is consistent with a role for Gq proteins, phospholipase Cβ, and Ca2+ mobilization in mitogenic signaling. However, other studies revealed that α16Q212L expression in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts profoundly inhibited bombesin (gastrin-releasing peptide) signal transduction including calcium mobilization, MAP kinase activation, and arachidonic acid release. The net effect was a nearly complete inhibition of bombesin (gastrin-releasing peptide)-stimulated DNA synthesis(17.Qian N.-X. Russell M. Buhl A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17417-17423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the latter studies, our findings show that expression of α16Q212L in SCLC lines resulted in strong inhibition of neuropeptide-regulated Ca2+ mobilization (Fig. 3) and dramatically reduced the ability of the cells to growth in soft agar (Fig. 2). These conflicting results concerning cellular actions of GTPase-deficient Gαq proteins may reflect different levels of expression of the α-subunits in the various cell lines where low expression results in transformation and high expression leads to negative modulation of intracellular signaling pathways and growth arrest. Alternatively, the ability of Gαq, phospholipase Cβ, and Ca2+ mobilization to stimulate DNA synthesis may be quite variable among different cell types. Expression of GTPase-deficient α16Q212L oppositely affected two signal transduction pathways normally engaged by neuropeptides and muscarinic agonists in SCLC; Ca2+ mobilization was inhibited, and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway was constitutively activated. Thus, α16Q212L expression induced discordant signaling in SCLC. We have found that α16Q212L expression also constitutively activates the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway in PC12 cells where growth arrest and neuronal differentiation is observed.3 The failure of phorbol esters to significantly activate the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway (Fig. 5C) in SCLC indicates that the phorbol ester-regulated forms of protein kinase C are not likely to mediate the activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway, although the potential involvement of nonphorbol ester-sensitive protein kinase C isoforms cannot be eliminated. Constitutive activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway in the absence of Ca2+ mobilization and p42/44 MAP kinase activation is correlated with a strong growth arrest in two cell types, SCLC and PC12 cells. It will be of interest to observe the spectrum of tumor cells where this response is growth inhibitory. Ultraviolet irradiation of H345 cells strongly activates the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway (Fig. 5C) and leads to a rapid apoptotic-like cell death. 4B. Storey and L. E. Heasley, unpublished results. The 2-fold activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway with α16Q212L expression relative to the greater than 10-fold activation by UV irradiation may, in addition to inhibited Ca2+ mobilization, explain the strong growth arrest observed in the SCLC lines. We hypothesize that high level constitutive activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway in the absence of neuropeptide-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization may have lethal consequences in SCLC. Consistent with this possibility was our inability to isolate α16Q212L-expressing clones in some SCLC lines such as H510, despite repeated attempts. We have found that a proximal regulator of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases is a MEK kinase distinct from Raf(25.Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 32.Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). MEK kinase activation is Ras-regulated and independent of Raf(32.Lange-Carter C.A. Johnson G.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Expression of activated MEK kinase-1 leads to cell death in several fibroblast systems and differentiation of PC12 cells 5C. A. Lange-Carter and G. L. Johnson, unpublished results. similar to the phenotype observed with activated αq members such as α16Q212L. Thus, the MEK kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase regulatory pathways may contribute to growth inhibition and possibly cell death, a sharply contrasting phenotype from that observed with activated Raf expression. These findings indicate that it is possible to inhibit cell growth of selected tumor cell types by selectively disrupting coordinated signal transduction pathways. Increasing awareness that signals controlling growth and apoptosis are overlapping is insightful in regards to these results. We suggest that the balance and magnitude of specific signal transduction pathways regulated by hormones and growth factors can determine commitment to tumor cell growth or arrest. Identifying tumors that have a strong growth inhibitory response resulting from activated αq expression will allow a new pharmacologic and genetic approach to cancer therapeutics. The ability of Gq family members of G proteins to regulate the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway and to cause growth inhibition in SCLC and some fibroblasts focuses our attention on the αq effectors capable of inhibiting tumor cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2028727657,"Thr-197 phosphate is essential for optimal activity of the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase enzyme, and, in the C subunit crystal structure, it is buried in a cationic pocket formed by the side chains of His-87, Arg-165, Lys-189, and Thr-195. Because of its apparent role in stabilizing the active conformation of C subunit and its resistance to several phosphatases, the phosphate on Thr-197 has been assumed to be metabolically stable. We now show that this phosphate can be removed from C subunit by a protein phosphatase activity extracted from S49 mouse lymphoma cells or by purified protein phosphatase-2A (PP-2A) with concomitant loss of enzymatic activity. By anion-exchange chromatography, inhibitor sensitivity, and relative activity against glycogen phosphorylase a and C subunit as substrates, the cellular phosphatase resembled a multimeric form of PP-2A. PP-1 was ineffective against native C subunit, but it was able to dephosphorylate Thr-197 in urea-treated C subunit. Accessibility of Thr-197 phosphate to the cellular phosphatase was enhanced by storage of C subunit in a phosphate-free buffer or by inclusion of modest concentrations of urea in the reactions and was reduced by salt concentrations in the physiological range and/or by amino-terminal myristoylation. It is concluded that a multimeric form of PP-2A or a closely related enzyme from cell extracts is capable of removing the Thr-197 phosphate from native C subunit in vitro and could account for significant turnover of this phosphate in intact cells.

The recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli is phosphorylated at these sites and, in addition, at Ser-10 and Ser-139 (1.Yonemoto W. Garrod S.M. Bell S.M. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18626-18632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Thr-197 slows the mobility of C subunit in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and “activates” the protein by reducing its Km values for both ATP and peptide substrates(2.Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thr-197 falls in the “loop” region between subdomains VII and VIII(3.Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3808) Google Scholar), which also is associated with activating phosphorylation sites in a number of other protein kinases, including CDC2 kinase, MAP kinase (or ERK), MAP kinase kinase (or MEK), and many protein tyrosine kinases(3.Hanks S.K.

In the crystal structure of C subunit, the Thr-197 phosphate appears to stabilize the active configuration of the catalytic cleft through ionic and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the side chains of His-87, Arg-165, Lys-189, and Thr-195(6.Knighton D.R.

Comparisons of the structures of inactive forms of the CDC2 and MAP kinases with that of the active C subunit suggest that phosphorylation of sites in this “activation loop” region is responsible for a structural rearrangement of the catalytic cleft that promotes substrate binding and catalysis(4.Morgan D.O.

Nevertheless, while phosphorylation of the activation loop in CDC2 kinase, MAP kinase, MAP kinase kinase, and many of the protein tyrosine kinases is regulated by the antagonistic actions of specific protein kinases and protein phosphatases, Thr-197 phosphate in C subunit has been thought to be metabolically stable(8.Bechtel P.J.

While undertaking experiments to optimize conditions for immunoprecipitation of C subunit from extracts of S49 mouse lymphoma cells, we noted that incubation of radiolabeled, recombinant C subunit with cell extract resulted in apparent dephosphorylation manifested by an increase in SDS-PAGE mobility. Although this reaction was most dramatic in buffers containing SDS or urea, there was also reactivity in the absence of these agents. This report describes experiments that identify the cellular activity as a protein phosphatase with properties similar to those of a multimeric form of protein phosphatase-2A (PP-2A) and characterize its reaction on C subunit. Phosphorylase a, glycogen (type III from rabbit liver), α-D-glucose 1-phosphate, ammonium molybdate, 1-amino-2-naphthol-4-sulfonic acid, and Sephadex G-50 were from Sigma; okadaic acid was from L.C. Laboratories; [Y-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont NEN; and ultrapure urea was from ICN Biochemicals. Kemptide, the heptapeptide substrate for C subunit, was prepared and purified by the Molecular Biology Resource Facility of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. The catalytic subunit and AC complex of PP-2A were gifts from Dr. Marc Mumby (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), and recombinant PP-1 and purified inhibitor-2 were gifts from Dr. Ernest Lee (University of Miami School of Medicine). Other chemicals were reagent grade or better and used without further purification. “C subunit storage buffer” contained 100 mM MES (pH 6.5), 100 mM potassium phosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol. Extraction buffer was 20 mM Tris hydrochloride (pH 7.4), 0.5 mM EDTA, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. QMA buffer contained 10 mM Tris hydrochloride (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. Phosphatase buffer was 10 mM Tris hydrochloride [pH 7.4], 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Phosphorylase diluent contained 100 mM imidazole acetate (pH 6.8), 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM sodium azide, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Phosphorylase substrate solution contained 50 mM glucose 1-phosphate and 2% (w/v) glycogen in 20 mM imidazole acetate (pH 6.8), 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 5 mM sodium azide, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Recombinant murine Cα subunit was expressed from the pET-8c expression vector in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously(2.Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myristoylated C subunit was prepared in similar fashion from bacteria carrying both the C subunit plasmid and pBB131, an expression plasmid for yeast N-myristoyl transferase(11.Duronio R.J. Jackson-Machelski E. Heuckeroth R.O. Olins P.O. Devine C.S. Yonemoto W. Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Nonmyristoylated C subunits were purified from cells induced for either 50 min or 5 h at room temperature to give either mostly nonphosphorylated C subunit or C subunit fully phosphorylated on Thr-197(2.Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); myristoylated C subunit was purified from cells induced for 5 h. For most experiments purified C subunits were stored at −20°C in C subunit storage buffer. For assays of anion-exchange column fractions, we used a C subunit preparation that had been stored in buffer containing 100 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 150 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 50% glycerol. After several weeks of storage, this preparation had lost about 80% of its activity and become markedly more susceptible to phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation of Thr-197. Although these changes appeared to be irreversible, there was no evidence of proteolysis, and the new properties were stable to further storage. 2S. Liauw and R. A. Steinberg, unpublished observations. Kinase-negative S49 mouse lymphoma cells (subline 24.6.1 [12.Steinberg R.A. van Daalen Wetters T. Coffino P. Cell. 1978; 15: 1351-1361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar]) in mid-logarithmic phase growth were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice by resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended at about 4 × 108 cells/ml with extraction buffer, frozen on dry ice, and stored at −70°C. For crude cell extracts, cells were thawed and centrifuged at 4°C for 15 min at 11,000 × g in a Beckman Microfuge II microcentrifuge. Supernatant fractions were then purified by gel filtration on superfine Sephadex G-50 in extraction buffer. The excluded peaks were concentrated using “Centricon-10” centrifugal concentrators (Amicon), frozen in small aliquots, and stored at −70°C. For anion-exchange purification, cell suspensions as above were thawed and centrifuged at 4°C for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatant fractions were then loaded onto columns of Accell Plus QMA (500 A, Waters/Millipore) equilibrated with QMA buffer; about 1 ml of packed resin was used for each 7 mg of cell protein. Columns were washed with five volumes of QMA buffer and then eluted with 13.5 column volumes of a linear 0-0.5 M gradient of sodium chloride in QMA buffer. Fractions containing protein phosphatase activity against C subunit were pooled and concentrated to about 12-15 mg/ml using Centriplus and Centricon concentrators (Amicon), and small aliquots were frozen and stored at −70°C. Phosphorylase phosphatase was assayed by the colorimetric procedure described by Gruppuso et al.(13.Gruppuso P.A. Johnson G.L. Constantinides M. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4288-4294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Equal volumes of diluted phosphatase and phosphorylase a (3 mg/ml) in phosphatase buffer were mixed and incubated for 60 min at 37°C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 49 volumes of ice-cold phosphorylase diluent, and portions of the diluted phosphorylase samples were then assayed for 30 min at 30°C in the direction of glycogen synthesis after mixing with equal volumes of phosphorylase substrate solution. Released phosphate was measured as the reduced phosphomolybdate after incubation with acidic ammonium molybdate and aminonaphtholsulfonic acid as described by Fiske and Subbarow(14.Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Equal volumes of diluted phosphatase and purified C subunit in phosphatase buffer (with or without additions) were incubated at 30 or 37°C as described in figure legends. (Reactions with PP-1 all included 0.1 mM manganese chloride, without which the enzyme was virtually inactive. Manganese ions had no effect on reactions with either PP-2A or the S49 cell phosphatase.) Reactions were stopped by adding a large excess of SDS gel sample buffer (15.O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and heating to 100°C for 2 min. The extent of Thr-197 dephosphorylation was determined by the proportion of C subunit converted to a faster migrating species in SDS-PAGE(2.Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the experiments of Fig. 2, 9, and 10, samples were stopped by diluting with phosphatase buffer containing either 100 mM sodium fluoride (see Fig. 2) or 1 μM okadaic acid (see Fig. 9 and 10) and assayed for protein kinase activity using kemptide as substrate as described previously(2.Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 9:Ionic strengths approaching the physiological range decrease the rate of C subunit dephosphorylation by the S49 cell phosphatase. C subunits at 6 μg/ml were incubated at 37°C for up to 4 h with 6 mg/ml S49 cell extract protein in phosphatase buffer with 0, 50, 100, 150, or 200 mM sodium chloride. At intervals, samples were diluted with buffer containing okadaic acid and assayed for protein kinase activity. Inactivation half-times (t1/2) were determined graphically.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Laemmli (16.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207112) Google Scholar) using 10% polyacrylamide gels with the pH of the lower gel solution optimized for separation of the Thr-197 phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of C subunit as described previously(2.Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were fixed with trichloroacetic acid, stained with silver nitrate(17.Merril C.R. Goldman D. Sedman S.A. Ebert M.H. Science. 1981; 211: 1437-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar), and dried between clear dialysis membrane sheets (Bio-Rad). Dried gels were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics model 300A computing densitometer and quantified using the IQ software package (Molecular Dynamics) in “area scan” mode with manual base line and peak selection. For the scan data of Fig. 2, the raw absorbance data was exported into the FigP software package (BioSoft) and normalized to a common non-C subunit peak; the absorbance in a contaminating species from the C subunit preparation that co-migrated with nonphosphorylated C subunit was subtracted from all scans before integrating. Recombinant, nonphosphorylated C subunit was labeled with [32P]phosphate from [[Y-32P]ATP as described previously (2.Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and dialyzed against two changes of protein-free phosphatase buffer using the micro-drop method of Marusyk and Sergeant(18.Marusyk R. Sergeant A. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 403-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Portions of the dialyzed sample were incubated without or with protein phosphatase preparations as described in the legend to Fig. 3, mixed with SDS-gel sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Acid hydrolysis of the gel-purified, radiolabeled C subunits and analysis of the hydrolysates by thin layer electrophoresis were as described previously(2.Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the effect of incubation with an S49 cell extract on the SDS-PAGE mobility of purified recombinant C subunit. The purified C subunit gave a single band at about 49 kDal as expected for protein fully phosphorylated at Thr-197 (Fig. 1, lane b). This mobility was unaffected by mixing with the cell extract (Fig. 1, lane c). After incubation for 3 h at 37°C, the majority of the C subunit was shifted to a form with faster mobility (Fig. 1, lane d). The chelators EDTA and EGTA had no effect on this mobility shift (Fig. 1, lanes e and f), but the protein phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride and okadaic acid completely prevented it (Fig. 1, lanes g and i). Sodium phosphate was a weak inhibitor of the “shift activity,” and sodium vanadate was totally ineffective (data not shown). The inhibition by sodium fluoride was not reproduced by sodium chloride (Fig. 1, lane h), indicating that the effect was not simply a response to high ionic strength. The mobility shifts illustrated in Fig. 1 were consistent with dephosphorylation at Thr-197. The “shifted” form co-migrated with purified “fast-form” C subunit, which is not phosphorylated at Thr-197(2.Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the fast-form preparation was unaffected by incubation with cell extract (data not shown). Since phosphorylation at Thr-197 has a dramatic effect on C subunit activity, we next tested whether or not the putative dephosphorylation was accompanied by a decrease in enzymatic activity. Fig. 2 shows that incubation with cell extract led to a time-dependent inactivation of C subunit. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that inactivation was paralleled by the mobility shift illustrated in Fig. 1. Sodium fluoride inhibited the extract-dependent inactivation, but there was a slow extract-independent inactivation that was not affected significantly by the inhibitor. For these and other experiments described in this report, we used extracts from a kinase-negative mutant of S49 cells to avoid the complication of C subunit endogenous to the cell extract. We established in early experiments, however, that wild-type S49 cells contain the same phosphatase activity at about the same level (data not shown). The experiment of Fig. 3 demonstrated that the S49 cell activity indeed removed phosphate from Thr-197 of C subunit. Incubation of fast form C subunit with [[Y-32P]ATP in the presence of trace amounts of “slow form” C subunit results in phosphorylation of the C subunit on Thr-197 and several serine residues (2.Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows gel patterns from such a preparation incubated without or with cell extract or a partially purified phosphatase fraction from S49 cells (below). The radiolabeled C subunit was mostly the slow form species, consistent with efficient phosphorylation at Thr-197. Treatment with either of the phosphatase preparations reduced the amount of label in C subunit and shifted the labeled protein to the position of fast form C subunit. Fig. 3B shows that the untreated, labeled C subunit had radioactivity in both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine but that the C subunit treated with cell extract or phosphatase had radioactivity only in phosphoserine. The results described above (Fig. 1) suggested that the S49 cell activity was related to either PP-1 or PP-2A. For further characterization of the activity, we fractionated cell extracts by anion-exchange chromatography. Fig. 4 shows a representative pattern from one of three such separations. Using glycogen phosphorylase a as substrate, we found multiple overlapping peaks of activity that eluted at salt concentrations between about 100 and 300 mM. The phosphatase active on C subunit appeared to co-elute with the later-eluting forms of the phosphorylase phosphatase. The fractions with highest activity on C subunit were pooled and concentrated for use in the experiments of Fig. 3, Fig. 5, and Fig. 7.Figure 5:Okadaic acid sensitivities of the protein phosphatase activities of S49 cells are intermediate between those of the catalytic subunits of PP-1 and PP-2A. An S49 cell extract (•), anion exchange-purified S49 cell protein phosphatase (○), purified PP-2A catalytic subunit (■), the AC complex of PP-2A (□), or the recombinant catalytic subunit of PP-1 (▲) was incubated with either glycogen phosphorylase a (A) or recombinant C subunit (B) for 2.5 h at 37°C in the absence or presence of okadaic acid at various concentrations. Phosphatase activity was monitored for A by loss of phosphorylase activity (“Experimental Procedures”) and for B by conversion of C subunit to the faster migrating, Thr-197 dephosphorylated form (Fig. 1). For the reactions of A, phosphorylase was at 1.5 mg/ml, and phosphatase preparations were at about 1.3 mg/ml, 0.3 mg/ml, 0.3 μg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, and 0.4 μg/ml, respectively, for the S49 extract, partially purified S49 phosphatase, PP-2A catalytic subunit, AC complex, and PP-1. For the reactions of B, C subunit was at 0.2 mg/ml, and phosphatases were at about 1.3 mg/ml, 2 mg/ml, 4 μg/ml, and 1 mg/ml, respectively, for the S49 extract, partially purified S49 phosphatase, PP-2A catalytic subunit, and AC complex. Because PP-1 had virtually no activity on native C subunit, its okadaic acid sensitivity with the C subunit substrate was not measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7:The S49 cell phosphatase has greater activity against native C subunit relative to its activity on glycogen phosphorylase than does monomeric PP-2A. Concentration dependences of the protein phosphatase activities of S49 cell extract (•), partially purified S49 cell protein phosphatase (○), purified PP-2A catalytic subunit (■), the AC complex of PP-2A (□), and the recombinant catalytic subunit of PP-1 (▲) were determined using both recombinant C subunit and glycogen phosphorylase substrates. The data for each preparation were normalized to the activity against phosphorylase to compare activities against C subunit. The activities against C subunit were monitored for 1.5 h at 37°C and scaled to the maximum dephosphorylation observed under these conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 5A shows that, when measured using glycogen phosphorylase as substrate, crude and partially purified S49 cell phosphatase activities had nearly identical sensitivities to okadaic acid that were intermediate between the more sensitive catalytic subunit of PP-2A and the more resistant recombinant catalytic subunit of PP-1. The sensitivity of the S49 cell activities was similar to that observed with a purified AC complex of PP-2A. Fig. 5B shows results from a similar experiment using C subunit as a substrate. Again the okadaic acid sensitivities for crude and partially purified S49 cell activities were similar to each other and of about the same order of magnitude as obtained using phosphorylase as a substrate. The purified catalytic subunit and AC complex of PP-2A gave somewhat steeper inhibition curves, and the activity of the PP-2A catalytic subunit on C subunit was apparently more resistant to okadaic acid than that on phosphorylase. This difference is probably an artifact attributable to higher concentrations of the purified subunit required to achieve efficient C subunit dephosphorylation (see Fig. 7, below). Using phosphorylase as substrate, the recombinant PP-1 was clearly sensitive to inhibitor-2, but neither purified PP-2A nor the S49 cell activity showed any sensitivity to this inhibitor (data not shown). The okadaic acid sensitivity of the reaction of PP-1 on C subunit could not be tested in the experiment of Fig. 5 because, as shown in Fig. 6, lanes c-e, recombinant PP-1 had no detectable activity on native C subunit. In the presence of 3 M urea, however, PP-1 was able to remove the phosphate from Thr-197 of C subunit (Fig. 6, lanes f-h). Neither potato acid phosphatase nor calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase were able to dephosphorylate C subunit in the presence or absence of urea. 3R. A. Steinberg, unpublished results. Fig. 7 compares the activities of PP-1, PP-2A, and the crude and partially purified S49 cell preparations on C subunit. The phosphatase concentrations were all expressed in terms of activity against glycogen phosphorylase. As noted above, PP-1 had no detectable activity on native C subunit. When normalized in this way, the S49 cell preparations were about 10 times more effective than the catalytic subunit of PP-2A as C subunit phosphatases. The AC complex of PP-2A appeared to be somewhat more effective on C subunit than the free catalytic subunit, but we had insufficient material to extend the curve to the higher concentrations required to achieve substantial C subunit dephosphorylation. Fig. 8 shows that low concentrations of urea enhance markedly the dephosphorylation of C subunit by S49 cell extracts. (The effect of urea was more difficult to assess with purified preparations of PP-2A or the S49 cell phosphatase because these preparations were more sensitive to urea-dependent inactivation.2) Fig. 8A shows that at a fixed concentration of phosphatase, urea concentrations as low as 0.5 M promoted dephosphorylation of C subunit at 30°C, where the native C subunit was not dephosphorylated significantly. Fig. 8B shows that the inclusion of 3 M urea shifted the phosphatase dose-response for dephosphorylation of C subunit at 30°C by about 2 orders of magnitude toward lower concentrations, while 1.5 M urea had a more moderate effect. Several studies had suggested that the conformation of C subunit is sensitive to ionic strengths around the physiological range(19.Cook P.F. Neville Jr., M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski Jr., R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 20.Jiménez J.S. Kupfer A. Gani V. Shaltiel S. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1623-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and C subunit stability is enhanced by ionic strengths above 100 mM(21.Reimann E.M. Beham R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The experiment of Fig. 9 investigated the effect of salt concentration on C subunit dephosphorylation using the inactivation assay of Fig. 2. The rate of dephosphorylation was slowed progressively by almost 10-fold as the salt concentration was increased from 0 to 200 mM. Salt concentrations in this range had very little effect on the phosphatase activity against glycogen phosphorylase (data not shown). The studies described to this point used recombinant C subunit that lacked the N-terminal myristoyl group that is present in the enzyme from mammalian tissues. To assess the effect of this group on the phosphatase reaction, the experiment of Fig. 10 compared dephosphorylation of nonmyristoylated C subunit with that of C subunit purified from bacteria that were co-expressing the yeast N-myristoyltransferase. The reactions again were monitored by measuring loss of kinase activity. With either 50 or 150 mM sodium chloride, dephosphorylation of the myristoylated C subunit was about 3-times slower than that of the nonmyristoylated subunit. The myristoylated form also appeared to be more resistant to phosphatase-independent inactivation as shown by its complete stability to incubation in the presence of okadaic acid. Our results indicate that the Thr-197 phosphate of native, recombinant C subunit can be removed by a protein phosphatase activity found in extracts of S49 mouse lymphoma cells. This dephosphorylation could be monitored by either a mobility shift in SDS-PAGE or a reduction in protein kinase activity, and it resulted in loss of labeled phosphothreonine from C subunit autophosphorylated in the presence of [Y-32P]ATP. Initial characterization suggested that the cellular activity was related to PP-1 and/or PP-2A. It was sensitive to fluoride ion and okadaic acid, which inhibit PP-1 and PP-2A, but resistant to the chelators EDTA and EGTA, which would have inhibited the Ca2+dependent PP-2B or the Mg2+dependent PP-2C (Fig. 1). Vanadate ions, which inhibit the dual-specific protein tyrosine phosphatases implicated in dephosphorylation of the MAP kinases(22.Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3796-3803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), had no effect on the cellular phosphatase active against C subunit. Further analysis using okadaic acid at concentrations that can distinguish between PP-1 and PP-2A and inhibitor-2, which is selective for PP-1, suggested that the cellular activity was either a form of PP-2A or a closely related enzyme (Fig. 5, and data not shown). Consistent with these results, the catalytic subunit of PP-2A could dephosphorylate native C subunit but that of PP-1 showed no activity against this protein (Figure 6:, Figure 7:). Fractionation of S49 cell extracts by anion-exchange chromatography resolved multiple peaks of protein phosphatase active against glycogen phosphorylase a, all of which were inhibited by a concentration of okadaic acid that had no effect on PP-1. These probably represent different multimeric complexes of PP-2A(23.Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Only the later eluting peaks had significant activity against C subunit, suggesting that not all complexes of PP-2A were equally active on C subunit (Fig. 4). The okadaic acid-sensitivity of the S49 cell activity was more similar to that of an AC complex of PP-2A than to that of the PP-2A catalytic subunit (Fig. 5). Furthermore, when normalized for activity against phosphorylase a, the S49 cell phosphatase was about 10-fold more active against C subunit than was the purified catalytic subunit of PP-2A (Fig. 7). We conclude from these observations that the S49 cell activity is probably a multimeric complex of PP-2A (AC or ABC(23.Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar)), although we cannot rule out the possibility that it is a novel enzyme with properties very similar to PP-2A. The cell extracts used in these studies were gel filtered to remove an inhibitor (or inhibitors) of the phosphorylase phosphatase activity. The activity against C subunit was unaffected by gel filtration (data not shown), suggesting another distinction between the phosphorylase and C subunit phosphatase activities. Treatment of C subunit with urea promoted dephosphorylation by the S49 cell activity (Fig. 8) and purified PP-2A (data not shown) and enabled the protein to be dephosphorylated by PP-1 (Fig. 4). On the other hand, neither potato acid phosphatase nor calf intestine alkaline phosphatase were able to dephosphorylate C subunit at Thr-197 with or without the chaotropic agent. These latter results might account for the widespread belief that the phosphate on Thr-197 was inaccessible for dephosphorylation, since experiments attempting to assess the role of phosphorylation in activity of C subunit used these broad spectrum phosphatases(8.Bechtel P.J. Beavo J.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2691-2697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Shoji S. Titani K. Demaille J.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6211-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was slowed markedly by physiological salt concentrations and by myristoylation (Figure 9:, Figure 10:), raising doubts as to its physiological relevance. On the other hand, our in vitro reactions were all carried out at subphysiological concentrations of phosphatase, and dephosphorylation rates increased with increasing phosphatase concentrations (Fig. 8B, and data not shown). The first published crystal structure of C subunit was a ternary complex with ATP and inhibitor peptide in which the phosphate on Thr-197 was closely associated with the functional groups of His-87, Arg-165, Lys-189, and Thr-195(6.Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Eyck L.F.T. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Structures of the apoenzyme and binary complexes of C subunit with an iodinated inhibitor peptide now have been reported and differ from the original structure primarily by rotation of the smaller of the protein's two lobes to give a more open conformation around the catalytic cleft(24.Karlsson R. Zheng J. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Acta Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 381-388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1559-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Where His-87 interacts with the Thr-197 phosphate in the closed ternary complex conformation, it is nearly 6 Å away in the open conformation. We suspect that this opening of the cleft and disruption of the interaction between His-87 and the Thr-197 phosphate is responsible for making the phosphate accessible to removal by PP-2A. The inhibitory effect of elevated salt on C subunit dephosphorylation (Fig. 9), then, would suggest that salt concentrations in the physiological range shift the dynamic equilibrium toward the closed conformation. Treatment of C subunit with concentrations of urea below 2 M had relatively small effects on the subsequent activity of C subunit, while increasing concentrations between 2 and 4 M led progressively to irreversible inactivation. 4S.-L. Lee and R. A. Steinberg, unpublished observations. The enhanced dephosphorylation of C subunit at low concentrations of urea (Fig. 8), therefore, probably reflected a loosening or opening of the structure around Thr-197 rather than complete denaturation of the protein. A similar enhancement without urea was observed in a C subunit preparation that had been partially inactivated by storage in buffer without phosphate (see “Experimental Procedures”). We attempted to assess the effect of Mg2+-ATP or Mg2+-ATPYS on the dephosphorylation reaction, since these compounds favor the closed conformation of C subunit, but, unfortunately, these compounds were also strong inhibitors of PP-2A (data not shown). We conclude that native C subunit can assume a conformation in which its critical phosphate on Thr-197 is susceptible to dephosphorylation by PP-2A and that this susceptibility is reduced by physiological ionic strength and the presence of an amino-terminal myristoyl group, two factors reported to stabilize C subunit structure(21.Reimann E.M. Beham R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 25.Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1559-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The reaction in vitro on native, myristoylated C subunit under near physiological conditions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength was sufficiently slow (e.g. t1/2< > 2 h in the experiment of Fig. 10) to question whether there is significant turnover of the Thr-197 phosphate in vivo. On the other hand, if dephosphorylation rates are linear with phosphatase concentration and all of the active phosphatase in our extracts is active in intact cells, the intracellular t1/2 for turnover of the Thr-197 phosphate could be as short as about 20 min.

https://openalex.org/W1577719026,"The nucleotide binding properties of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor protein-tyrosine kinase were investigated with the fluorescent nucleotide analog 2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate (TNP-ATP). TNP-ATP was found to be an active substrate for the autophosphorylation reaction of the recombinant EGF receptor protein-tyrosine kinase domain (TKD). Whereas the Vmax for the TNP-ATP-dependent autophosphorylation reaction was approximately 200-fold lower than that of ATP, the Km for this reaction was similar to that observed with ATP. The nucleotide analog was also shown to be an inhibitor of the ATP-dependent autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation reactions of the TKD. Spectroscopic studies demonstrated both a high affinity binding of TNP-ATP to the recombinant TKD and a markedly enhanced fluorescence of the bound nucleotide analog. The fluorescence of enzyme-bound TNP-ATP was attenuated in the presence of ATP, which enabled determination of the dissociation constants for both ATP and the Mn2+ complex of ATP. A truncated form of the EGF receptor TKD lacking the C-terminal autophosphorylation domain exhibited an enhanced affinity for TNP-ATP, which indicated that the autophosphorylation domain occupied the peptide substrate binding site of the TKD and modulated the binding of the nucleotide substrates. The nucleotide binding properties of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor protein-tyrosine kinase were investigated with the fluorescent nucleotide analog 2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate (TNP-ATP). TNP-ATP was found to be an active substrate for the autophosphorylation reaction of the recombinant EGF receptor protein-tyrosine kinase domain (TKD). Whereas the Vmax for the TNP-ATP-dependent autophosphorylation reaction was approximately 200-fold lower than that of ATP, the Km for this reaction was similar to that observed with ATP. The nucleotide analog was also shown to be an inhibitor of the ATP-dependent autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation reactions of the TKD. Spectroscopic studies demonstrated both a high affinity binding of TNP-ATP to the recombinant TKD and a markedly enhanced fluorescence of the bound nucleotide analog. The fluorescence of enzyme-bound TNP-ATP was attenuated in the presence of ATP, which enabled determination of the dissociation constants for both ATP and the Mn2+ complex of ATP.

In certain simple epithelial cell types and hematopoietic cells, TGF-β1 has been reported to induce programmed cell death (Oberhammer et al., 1992; Rotello et al., 1991; Lotem and Sachs, 1992). TGF-β1 also inhibits the growth of normal human keratinocytes in vitro (Pietenpol et al., 1990). Based on studies using normal human keratinocytes and the murine keratinocyte cell line, BALB/MK, it is known that TGF-β1 inhibits keratinocytes in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Shipley et al., 1986) through a mechanism that most likely involves transcriptional down-regulation of c-myc expression (Pietenpol et al., 1990; Munger et al., 1992). In the present study, we identify TGF-β1 as an important inhibitor of apoptosis in cultured normal human keratinocytes. We propose that TGF-β1 may function as a signal to forestall apoptosis as well as replication in the basal layer of human skin.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CultureNormal keratinocytes were isolated from newborn human foreskin. Keratinocyte cultures were established by plating aliquots of the single cell suspension in the presence of mitomycin C-treated 3T3 feeder cells as described by Allen-Hoffmann and Rheinwald(1984). The standard keratinocyte culture medium was composed of a mixture of Ham's F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (3:1, 0.66 mM calcium) supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 8.4 ng/ml cholera toxin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 24 μg/ml adenine, 10 ng/ml EGF, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Twenty-four hours prior to treatment, 3T3 feeder cells were removed from keratinocyte cultures by 0.5 mM EDTA rinses, and standard keratinocyte growth medium was replaced. Normal keratinocytes were not used beyond passage 5. NRK cells, clone 49F (American Type Tissue Collection, CRL 1570), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. Experiments were performed with NRK cells before passage 25. All cultures were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.Cell TreatmentsFor suspension studies, adherent cells were suspended in semisolid medium or treated with medium alone for the indicated times. Medium was made semisolid with sterile methylcellulose (4,000 centipoises, Fisher Scientific) as described previously (Sadek and Allen-Hoffmann, 1994). Unless otherwise indicated, semisolid media were composed of serum-free Ham's F12/DMEM (3:1) containing 1.68% methylcellulose and supplemented with the aforementioned additives.Cells were suspended following removal from tissue culture plates with 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% trypsin, washed with serum-containing medium to inactivate residual trypsin, then with serum-free medium, and suspended in the desired semisolid medium at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in sterile 50-ml polypropylene tubes. Suspended cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were recovered from suspension at various times by repeated dilution of the semisolid medium with serum-free medium followed by centrifugation at 440 × g. Adherent control cultures were treated with medium alone for the indicated times.Measurement of Internucleosomal FragmentationFollowing treatments, 2.5 × 106 cells were lysed in 500 μl of 50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.5% (w/v) sodium lauroyl sarcosine, and the lysate was aliquoted and stored at −85°C. Following addition of 500 μl of 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 (TE buffer) the lysate was extracted twice in a siliconized microcentrifuge tube with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v/v), treated with DNase-free RNase A (Sigma), 50 μg/ml final concentration, for 15 min at 37°C, and extracted again with an equal volume phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. The aqueous phase was extracted twice with an equal volume of chloroform alone, and nucleic acids were precipitated overnight at −85°C following addition of 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 2 volumes of ice-cold absolute ethanol. DNA was collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g in a Microfuge (Beckman Instruments) for 30 min. The DNA was rinsed with 95% ethanol, air-dried for 5 min, and dried in a HetoVac CS1 vacuum concentrator (InterMed, Denmark) for 5 min. The DNA was dissolved in 20 μl of TE buffer, pH 8.0. DNA was quantitated by absorption at 260 nm and stored at 4°C at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in TE.Intact and fragmented DNA was 3′-end-labeled with [α-32P]ddATP using terminal dideoxynucleotidylexotransferase as described by Tilly and Hsueh (1993). Briefly, each reaction mixture contained 1 × reaction buffer (0.2 M potassium cacodylate, 25 mM Tris-HCl, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 6.6), 2.5 mM CoCl2, 25 units of terminal dideoxynucleotidyltransferase (Boehringer Mannheim), and [α-32P]ddATP (specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) diluted with cold ddATP to a final concentration of 340 pM ddATP or 12.5 μCi/reaction. Each reaction was initiated by the addition of 360 ng of sample DNA, incubated for 60 min at 37°C, and terminated by the addition of 25 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, final concentration. Labeled DNA was separated from unincorporated [α-32P]ddATP by precipitation with ice-cold 100% ethanol in the presence of 2 M ammonium acetate and 50 μg of yeast tRNA (Sigma) followed by a second precipitation with ice-cold 100% ethanol. The pellet was collected by centrifugation, rinsed in ice-cold 80% ethanol, dissolved in 50 μl of TE buffer, pH 8.0, and stored at −20°C. One half of each labeled sample was loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel and electrophoresed. Gels were dried without heat using a vacuum dryer (Bio-Rad) or with heat using a SE 1200 Easy Breeze (Hoeffer Scientific, San Francisco, CA) and exposed to X-Omat photographic film.Northern AnalysisPoly(A)+ RNA was isolated from logarithmically growing cells as described previously (Sadek and Allen-Hoffmann, 1994). Poly(A)+ RNA was electrophoresed in a 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and electroblotted to a Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was prehybridized and then hybridized in the presence of a random primer [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe as recommended by the supplier. The cDNA probes used were to rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pGPDN5 (Fort et al., 1985), monkey TGF-β1 (Sharples et al., 1987), and a 830-base pair 5′-fragment of human c-myc (Miyamoto et al., 1985).Anchorage-independent Growth AssayAnchorage-independent growth of NRK-49F cells in keratinocyte-conditioned semisolid medium was determined by a methylcellulose/agar assay. Conditioned semisolid medium was generated by the suspension of subconfluent cultures of keratinocytes in serum-free Ham's F12/DMEM (3:1) supplemented with 1.68% methylcellulose and antibiotics for the indicated times. Keratinocytes were removed from semisolid medium by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. To assay anchorage-independent growth, a 0.5-ml aliquot of semisolid medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 10 ng/ml EGF, and NRK-49F indicator cells (6 × 103 cells/ml) was layered over 0.5 ml of the bottom layer of 0.5% Noble agar in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a CoStar 24-well plate. A standard curve for TGF-β1-dependent anchorage-independent NRK-49F cell growth was generated for each experiment using the following concentrations of recombinant TGF-β1: 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 ng/ml semisolid medium. In some experiments, the conditioned and unconditioned methylcellulose-containing medium was supplemented with 2.5 μg/ml turkey anti-human TGF-β1 neutralizing antibody (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) for 1 h at room temperature prior to the addition of NRK-49F cells. After 7 days, colonies ≥60 μm were scored.RESULTSSuspension of Keratinocytes Induces TGF-β1 ExpressionIn certain simple epithelial cell types and hematopoietic cells, TGF-β1 has been reported to induce programmed cell death (Oberhammer et al., 1992; Rotello et al., 1991; Lotem and Sachs, 1992). Because suspension is a potent inducer of apoptosis in normal human keratinocytes, we asked if suspension affected the level of autocrine production of keratinocyte TGF-β1. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from adherent keratinocytes and cells suspended in serum-free semisolid medium for 6, 12, 24, and 72 h. Two keratinocyte strains from different donors were analyzed. In both strains suspension caused an increase in the steady state levels of TGF-β1 mRNA within 6 h (Fig. 1). Concomitant with the increase in keratinocyte TGF-β1 mRNA levels, steady state c-myc RNA levels decline in a time-dependent manner. This finding is consistent with the known effects of TGF-β1 on c-myc gene expression in keratinocytes. These results suggest that suspension increases the amount of TGF-β1 protein produced by keratinocytes.We next determined if suspended keratinocytes produced increased levels of biologically active TGF-β1. Keratinocytes were suspended in serum-free and additive-free semisolid medium for 0, 12, 24, and 48 h. Following suspension, keratinocytes were removed by centrifugation to generate keratinocyte-conditioned semisolid medium. To control for lysis of keratinocytes following centrifugation, keratinocytes were suspended in semisolid medium and immediately removed (t = 0). Anchorage-independent growth of NRK-49F cells was used as a bioassay to determine the presence of biologically active TGF-β1 in keratinocyte-conditioned medium. Neutralizing anti-TGF-β1 antibody was added to the keratinocyte-conditioned medium to confirm that TGF-β1 alone was inducing anchorage-independent growth. As seen in Fig. 2, keratinocyte-conditioned medium supports the anchorage-independent growth of the NRK-49F indicator cells. Surprisingly, non-acidified keratinocyte-conditioned medium supported NRK-49F colony formation as well as acidified medium (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the number of anchorage-independent colonies is proportional to the amount of time the keratinocytes conditioned the semisolid medium. Suspended keratinocytes typically produced the equivalent of between 50 and 100 pg of recombinant human TGF-β1/ml of semisolid medium. Inhibition of TGF-β1 with neutralizing anti-TGF-β1 antibody decreased NRK-49F colony formation to background levels. Twice as much antibody was required to neutralize the activity in 48-h keratinocyte-conditioned medium. Therefore, loss of keratinocyte cell-cell and/or cell-substratum interaction is an inducer of TGF-β1 gene expression and ultimately promotes increased synthesis and perhaps activation of this epithelial growth inhibitor.Figure 2:Conditioned medium from suspended keratinocytes contains active TGF-β1. Cultured keratinocytes were suspended in serum-free, additive-free, semisolid growth medium for 12, 24, and 48 h to generate conditioned semisolid medium (CM). Keratinocytes were removed from the conditioned medium by centrifugation without dilution of the semisolid medium. To control for possible cell lysis during centrifugation, keratinocytes were suspended in semisolid medium and immediately removed by centrifugation (0 h conditioned semisolid medium). Indicator cells, NRK-49F, were assayed for anchorage-independent growth in the keratinocyte-conditioned media. Conditioned medium was incubated with or without a neutralizing anti-human TGF-β1 antibody (2.5 μg/ml) for 1 h prior to the addition of NRK-49F cells. As a control for background levels of anchorage-independent growth, NRK-49F cells were suspended in semisolid medium supplemented with EGF alone. A standard curve for TGF-β1-dependent anchorage-independent NRK-49F cell growth was generated for each experiment using the following concentrations of recombinant TGF-β1: 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 ng/ml semisolid medium. After 7 days, anchorage-independent colonies of NRK-49F cells were scored. Data represent the average number (mean ± S.D. of three replicates per condition) of colonies (>60 μm) per well.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TGF-β1 Attenuates Suspension-induced DNA FragmentationTo investigate a possible causal relationship between TGF-β1 and apoptosis in human keratinocytes, we treated adherent and suspended keratinocytes with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 in serum-free medium for 24 h. Following treatment the cells were analyzed for nucleosomal fragmentation and the ability to initiate a colony when replated in surface culture. In adherent keratinocytes, treatment with TGF-β1 for 24 h did not alter the colony-forming ability upon replating when compared with control (Fig. 3A) or induce DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Surprisingly, treatment of suspended keratinocytes with TGF-β1 attenuated suspension-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore, addition of TGF-β1 to the semisolid medium modestly enhanced the colony-forming potential of suspended keratinocytes. We next determined if endogenous TGF-β1 from suspended keratinocytes affected DNA fragmentation. To inhibit the effects of suspension-mediated endogenous TGF-β1, we suspended keratinocytes in semisolid medium containing a TGF-β1 neutralizing antibody. Neutralization of keratinocyte TGF-β1 consistently increased DNA fragmentation following suspension (Fig. 4), although the magnitude of this response varies among experiments. Therefore, in normal human keratinocytes, TGF-β1 appears to attenuate nucleosomal fragmentation following abrogation of cell-substratum and/or cell-cell interactions.Figure 3:TGF-β1 inhibits internucleosomal cleavage in suspended keratinocytes. Keratinocytes (NS-2-Ep) were suspended for 24 h in serum-free, semisolid growth medium containing 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 or an equal volume of diluent (4 mM HCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Adherent control cells were refed with serum-free growth medium containing 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 or diluent at the beginning of the treatment period. A, keratinocytes were plated onto mitomycin C-treated 3T3 feeder layers to determine the effect of treatments on replicative potential in surface culture. After 14 days, cultures were fixed with formaldehyde, stained with methylene blue, and counted. Data represent the average colony-forming efficiency (CFE, mean ± S.D. of six replicates per treatment) for each condition.

Adherent control cells received serum-free growth medium with or without anti-TGF-β1 antibody at the beginning of the 24-h treatment period.

TGF-β1 is an autocrine growth factor that inhibits the growth of adherent human keratinocytes in vitro (Shipley et al., 1986; Pietenpol et al., 1990). Suspension of keratinocytes also results in a decrease in the steady state mRNA levels of c-myc. This finding is consistent with the known effects of suspension and TGF-β1 on the growth of keratinocytes. We suspect that the suspension-induced decrease in c-myc mRNA levels may be mediated, in part, through increased production of TGF-β1. The role of TGF-β1 in terminal differentiation or programmed cell death in stratified squamous epithelia is unclear. In vivo, TGF-β1 plays a role in the maintenance of normal tissue architecture in rodent skin. For example, transgenic mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the TGF-β1 locus exhibit epidermal hyperproliferation as measured by an increase in the labeling index of basal cell nuclei following administration of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (Glick et al., 1993). However, these TGF-β1 null mice express the differentiation-specific keratins, K1 and K10, normally (Glick et al., 1993). Based on these reports and our findings it is reasonable to postulate that TGF-β1 may exert its effect on epidermal homeostasis by affecting the number of cells present in the tissue as opposed to directly affecting the synthesis and/or organization of differentiation-specific proteins.We have recently found that suspension of normal human keratinocytes induces both morphological and biochemical features of programmed cell death, such as membrane blebbing and DNA fragmentation.1 Because TGF-β1 has been implicated in the regulation of programmed cell death in a variety of epithelial cell types (Rotello et al., 1991; Oberhammer et al., 1991; Bursch et al., 1993), we determined if endogenous production of TGF-β1 played a role in suspension-mediated apoptotic signaling in keratinocytes. In contrast to findings in hepatocytes and hematopoietic and lymphoid cells, we found that TGF-β1 protected against suspension-induced DNA fragmentation in keratinocytes. Treatment of suspended keratinocytes with exogenously added TGF-β1 dramatically attenuated suspension-induced nucleosomal fragmentation. Furthermore, neutralizing endogenously produced TGF-β1 activity in suspended keratinocytes increased DNA fragmentation. Neither DNA fragmentation nor colony-forming efficiency was affected by treatment of adherent cells with TGF-β1. It is possible that TGF-β1 delays the onset of suspension-induced DNA fragmentation rather than blocking the apoptotic response altogether. Nevertheless, it is clear that TGF-β1 does not promote apoptosis in adherent or suspended human keratinocytes in vitro. Based on these findings, we propose that TGF-β1 functions to protect cultured keratinocytes from suspension-induced DNA fragmentation. Consistent with this interpretation, TGF-β1 is present exclusively in the basal layer of normal mouse epidermis (Glick et al., 1993) where it may serve to protect against apoptosis in the replicative compartment of skin. TGF-β1 also increases expression of cell adhesion molecules such as fibronectin, collagens, and their cognate cell surface receptors (reviewed by Massague(1990)), thereby potentially increasing cellular adhesiveness. Our findings may have important implications for the current understanding of normal epidermal wound healing (reviewed by Gailit and Clark(1994)). For example, increased endogenous levels of TGF-β1, as well as that contributed by platelets, may serve to forestall injury-induced apoptosis in a wound while increasing the production of extracellular matrix and keratinocyte adhesiveness. TGF-β1, although a potent keratinocyte growth inhibitor, may serve to forestall apoptosis in this renewal tissue during times of tissue regeneration.

At present, little is known about the conformation of the βγ dimer or about the areas of βγ that interact with α. Direct information on the orientation of protein surfaces can be obtained from analysis of chemically cross-linked products. Previous work in this laboratory showed that 1,6-bismaleimidohexane, which reacts with cysteine residues, specifically cross-links α to β and β to γ (Yi, F., Denker, B. M., and Neer, E. J.(1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 3900-3906). To identify the residues in β and γ involved in cross-linking to each other or to α, we have mutated the cysteines in β1, γ2, and γ3 and analyzed the mutated proteins by in vitro translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. All the mutants were able to form βγ dimers that could interact with the α subunit. We found that 1,6-bismaleimidohexane can cross-link β1 to γ3 but not to γ2. The cross-link goes from Cys25 in β1 to Cys30 in γ3. This cysteine is absent from any of the other known γ isoforms and therefore confers a distinctive property to γ3. The β subunit in the β1γ2 dimer can be cross-linked to an unidentified protein in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate, generating a product slightly larger than cross-linked β1γ3. The β subunit can also be cross-linked to α, giving rise to two products on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, both of which were previously shown to be formed by cross-linking β to Cys215 in αo (Thomas, T. C., Schmidt, C. J., and Neer, E. J.(1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 10295-10299). Mutation of Cys204 in β1 abolished one of these two products, whereas mutation of Cys271 abolished the other. Because both α-β cross-linked products are formed in approximately equal amounts, Cys204 and Cys271 in β are equally accessible from Cys215 in αo. Our findings begin to define intersubunit surfaces, and they pose structural constraints upon any model of the βγ dimer.

Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) 1The abbreviations used are: G proteinsguanine nucleotide-binding proteinsBMH1,6-bismaleimidohexaneDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. are key components of the transmembrane signaling machinery. They link cell surface receptors to intracellular enzymes or ion channels whose modulated activity ultimately leads to the cellular response. G proteins are made up of three different polypeptides, α, β, and γ: the α subunit binds and hydrolyzes GTP; the β and γ subunits form a very tight complex and can therefore be considered as a functional monomer. In the inactive state, GDP is bound to the heterotrimer. However, upon receptor stimulation, GDP is replaced by GTP, and the α subunit becomes activated and dissociates from the βγ dimer. The free subunits, both α and βγ, can then modulate the activity of target effectors (reviewed by Neer(1995)). guanine nucleotide-binding proteins 1,6-bismaleimidohexane dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The structural basis for the α subunit function is now better understood because of the recent solution of the crystal structure of GTP- and GDP-liganded forms of two α subunits: transducin and αi1 (Noel et al., 1993; Lambright et al., 1994; Coleman et al., 1994). In contrast, little is known about the structure of βγ. The β subunit is predicted to contain an amino-terminal amphipatic α helix that may be involved in coiled-coil interactions with γ (Lupas et al., 1992). The remaining sequence is made up of seven repeating units of approximately 43 amino acids each (Fong et al., 1986). These repeating units, also found in many other proteins, consist of a conserved core, usually starting with the sequence Gly-His (GH) and ending with Trp-Asp (WD) and are therefore referred to as WD repeats. Each core is predicted to form a β strand-turn-β strand-turn-β strand structure, followed by a loop of variable length leading to the next core (Neer et al., 1994). The γ subunit is predicted to be largely α helical (Lupas et al., 1992). In solution it behaves as an asymmetrical, extended molecule (Mende et al., 1995). A cysteine residue near its carboxyl terminus is prenylated, and this lipid modification has been shown to be essential for membrane attachment of the βγ dimer (reviewed by Casey(1994) and Wedegaertner et al.(1995)). There is, however, little information about the spatial organization of the β repeats and about the overall configuration of the dimer. The parts of βγ that interact with α or with effectors have not been identified, although genetic analysis in yeast has suggested some important residues (Leberer et al., 1992; Whiteway et al., 1994). However, because the surface of the βγ dimer facing the α subunit will presumably be exposed after dissociation of the subunits, it is likely that this area would be important for interaction with effectors. Therefore, to understand how signaling by βγ is regulated, we need to define the regions of the subunits that face each other and eventually to locate the contact points. Analysis of mutated and chimeric molecules can help identify regions important for protein-protein interactions. However, such an approach cannot discriminate regions that are near each other from regions that maintain the conformation necessary for the interaction. More direct information on the orientation of protein surfaces can be obtained from analysis of chemically cross-linked products. This laboratory has previously shown that purified G protein subunits can be cross-linked using 1,6-bismaleimidohexane (BMH), a homobifunctional cross-linker reacting with sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues. BMH specifically cross-links α to β and β to γ. Hydrodynamic analysis demonstrates that the cross-linked product containing α and β is composed of one α and one β subunit and likewise, the cross-linked βγ product is composed of only one β and one γ subunit (Yi et al., 1991; Thomas et al., 1993b). However, as is common for cross-linked proteins, these products migrate anomalously in SDS-PAGE. 2In our previous reports, the two cross-linked αβ products were assigned apparent molecular masses of 140 and 122 kDa, respectively. However, we have observed that the mobility of these products on SDS-PAGE, which is anomalously low (122 kDa is more than the sum of the molecular masses of α and β), is affected, in addition, by the percentage of polyacrylamide used to resolve them on SDS-PAGE. Whereas 11% polyacrylamide gels were used in our previous studies, we have now changed to 9% polyacrylamide gels to improve the resolution of the high molecular mass bands. The products now migrate with apparent molecular masses of about 100 and 112 kDa. The mobility of these products relative to markers also varies depending on how long the electrophoresis continues. We frequently run our gels until the 36-kDa β subunit band is at the bottom of the gel, and we have noted subtle differences in the relative mobilities of the bands; these differences, however, do not cause any ambiguity in identifying them. We have previously established that BMH cross-links αo to βγ through cysteine 215 in αo (Thomas et al., 1993a). This cysteine residue is found in the α2 helix, a region shown to have a different conformation in α-GDP compared with α-GTP (Lambright et al., 1994). We now report the identification of the sites in β and γ involved in the formation of the αβ and βγ cross-links. These studies begin to map the regions of β near the αβ contact surface, and they set physical limits to the distance between residues in α, β, and γ. Cysteine residues in β1 and γ2 were mutated to alanines using the Altered Sites in vitro Mutagenesis System (Promega). This system uses a dual primer method to introduce a site-directed mutation in the cloned sequence and, simultaneously, antibiotic resistance in the vector, thus allowing a straightforward procedure for selection of mutants. For this purpose, rat β1 and bovine γ2 cDNAs (generous gifts of Dr. R. R. Reed and Dr. M. I. Simon) were subcloned into the pAlter vector, and single stranded DNA was obtained following the manufacturer's instructions and used as template to anneal the mutagenic oligonucleotide and the ampicillin repair oligonucleotide. The presence of mutations was confirmed by sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Corp. Sequenase 2.0 kit). The mutants that did not behave like the wild type on cross-linking assays (β1 C25A, β1 C204A, and β1 C271A) were completely sequenced to rule out the presence of additional mutations. Cysteine residues in position 30 and 50 in γ3 (cDNA kindly provided by Dr. M. I. Simon) were individually mutated by polymerase chain reaction using primers that included conveniently located restriction sites at the 3′ end of the mutated residue (StyI and BamHI, respectively). The detailed sequences of the oligonucleotides used as primers are TGCTGCCTTGGACACCTTTATCCGGGCCAA for mutation of Cys30 and GAGGGGATCCTCAGCGGCG for mutation of Cys50. The inserts were completely sequenced to ensure that no additional mutations were introduced during the polymerase chain reaction reaction. All subunits were transcribed and translated using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Typically,1 μg of plasmid DNA and 20 μCi of [35S]methionine were used in a 50-μl reaction. In all cases transcription was directed by the T7 promoter. γ3 cDNA was subcloned into a vector (PAGA-1 vector, kindly provided by Dr. Orly Reiner) containing a poly(A) sequence and the alfalfa mosaic virus leader sequence, which has been previously shown to improve translation efficiency (Jobling and Gehrke, 1987). Synthesis of the desired product was routinely verified by running 5 μl of the translation mixture in a small 11 or 13% polyacrylamide gel (Laemmli, 1970) followed by autoradiography with overnight exposure. Independently translated β and γ subunits were mixed together and incubated at 37°C for 90 min to allow dimer formation. Because γ translation was usually more efficient, 10-15 μl of γ translation mixture were typically added to 50 μl of β translate. Following incubation, a trypsin digestion assay was performed to verify dimerization. As described previously, 7 μl of βγ mixture were treated with 1 μl of 5 μML-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Cooper Biomed) and incubated at 30°C for 10 min, after which 2 μl of 100 mM benzamidine were added to stop the reaction. The samples were then boiled for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 11% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, soaked in ENHANCE (DuPont NEN) for 1 h, dried, and exposed to film at −70°C for 1-3 days. 50 μl of the βγ mixture remaining after analysis by tryptic cleavage were passed over an 8-ml AcA 34 column (Sepracor) equilibrated with HMSE (50 mM NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 6 mM MgCl2, 75 mM sucrose, and 1 mM EDTA) plus 0.1% Lubrol PX at 4°C, in order to remove DTT and to separate the βγ dimers from undimerized β. 200-μl fractions were collected, and those containing both subunits were pooled and concentrated 5-10-fold using a Centricon-30 concentrator (Amicon). For cross-linking, 30 μl of this sample were mixed with 10 μl of αo (2-5 μg) purified from bovine brain (Neer et al., 1984) in HMSE or 10 μl of HMSE buffer alone, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 1.6 μl of freshly prepared 50 mM BMH (Pierce Chemical Co) in Me2SO. In control uncross-linked samples, 20 mM DTT was added prior to BMH. After 40 min at 4°C, DTT (20 mM) and/or Laemmli sample buffer containing 15%β-mercaptoethanol were added, and the samples were boiled, resolved by SDS-PAGE on 9% polyacrylamide gels, and treated as described previously. The radioactive bands could be visualized after 2-7 days of exposure at −70°C. Cross-linking of purified subunits was performed as described previously (Yi et al., 1991); 5-10 μg of bovine brain purified βγ or αoβγ (Neer et al., 1984) in HMSE plus 0.4-0.6% Lubrol PX were used for each reaction. Fig. 1A shows that G protein subunits purified from brain or translated in vitro give a similar pattern of bands cross-linked by BMH (Fig. 1A, indicated by arrows). We previously showed with purified heterotrimers that the two larger molecular mass products (Fig. 1A, marked αβ, solid arrows) contain both α and β subunits (2.Cali J.J. Balcueva E.A. Rybalkin I. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24023-24027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Yi et al., 1991). The same two products are obtained with αo and in vitro translated β and γ subunits (see Fig. 1A). Purified βγ dimers can also be cross-linked by BMH (Thomas et al., 1993b), giving rise to a product with an apparent molecular mass of ~48 kDa (Fig. 1, marked βγ, solid arrow). The formation of this band is diminished in the presence of an excess of purified αo (see the description of cross-linking of αo to β1γ3 dimers below). The identity of the ~50kDa band obtained only with in vitro translated subunits (Fig. 1A, open arrow) will be discussed in detail later. None of the three major cross-linked products obtained with in vitro translated subunits are formed when the experiment is carried out with β alone or γ alone (Fig. 1B, set A, β1 only and set B, γ2 only), with or without α. Other minor products formed by BMH can be detected after autoradiography. However, it was not our goal to characterize all cross-linked products. We have focused on the three major ones. Note that the bands in set B (γ2 only), which was deliberately overexposed, are not cross-linker-dependent. Moreover, we have previously shown that combinations of β and γ subtypes that cannot form functional dimers, for example β2 and γ1, do not generate any of those bands, showing that cross-linking strictly depends on the formation of βγ dimers (Spring and Neer, 1994). As expected, the two high molecular mass products (solid arrows, set C in Fig. 1B) are seen whether [35S]α translated in vitro and purified βγ dimers (Thomas et al., 1993a) or [35S]βγ translated in vitro and purified αo (as shown in these studies) are used for cross-linking, confirming that both products contain α and β. The faint bands in the middle lane in set C (β1γ2+ BMH without αo) probably result from cross-linking β to the small amount of α subunit present in the reticulocyte lysate (Denker et al., 1992). The goal of these studies was to identify the cysteine residues in β and γ that are involved in cross-linking these subunits to α or to each other. The strategy was to mutate the cysteine residues in both subunits and test which mutations interfered with the cross-linking. In order for this strategy to be successful, the mutated β and γ subunits must be able to dimerize with each other and to interact with α. Otherwise, failure to cross-link could not be attributed to loss of a cysteine involved in cross-linking and would be uninterpretable. We started by individually mutating each one of the 14 cysteine residues in the β1 sequence, and we used a well established tryptic protection assay to assess βγ dimerization. This assay is based on the observation that when β is associated with γ, only one of its 32 potential tryptic cleavage sites is initially accessible, thus generating two fragments: an amino-terminal 14-kDa fragment, which is unstable and therefore difficult to detect on SDS-PAGE, and a stable carboxyl-terminal 24-kDa fragment, which is taken as an indicator of the formation of a properly folded βγ dimer (Schmidt and Neer, 1991). As shown in Fig. 2, all of the β cysteine mutants behaved like the wild type upon trypsin digestion, indicating that they can all dimerize with the γ2 subunit and thus can be used for cross-linking. When dimers containing different β1 cysteine mutants and wild type γ2 were cross-linked to αo and the resulting products resolved on SDS-PAGE, we observed that most of the β1 mutants were still able to generate the two cross-linked αβ bands (Fig. 3, solid arrows). However, two of the mutations affected the cross-linking to αo; mutation of Cys204 blocked the formation of the upper band, whereas mutation of Cys271 abolished the lower band. The fact that each of these mutant βγ dimers can still form one of the two cross-linked αβ products shows that each is still able to interact with α. It was previously established in this laboratory that both cross-linked products are generated through a single cysteine residue in the αo subunit (Cys215), because mutation of that amino acid prevented the formation of both bands (Thomas et al., 1993a). Therefore, each one of the two bands is due to cross-linking Cys215 in αo to a different cysteine in β1: Cys204 for the upper band and Cys271 for the lower one. The possibility existed that γ might be present in one of the two products, presumably the one with the larger apparent molecular mass. However, because each cross-linked product is affected by mutation of only one cysteine residue in αo (Cys215) and one cysteine residue in β1 (Cys204 or Cys271), we conclude that neither product contains an additional cross-linked component, which would have required the involvement of yet another cysteine residue. The distinct mobilities on SDS-PAGE of the two cross-linked products of the same composition are probably due to differences in SDS binding or in the shape of the denatured molecules resulting from the two alternate cross-linking sites in β. We next analyzed how mutation of the cysteine residues in the β1 subunit affected the third cross-linker-specific band obtained with in vitro translated subunits (see Fig. 1, A and B, open arrows). The formation of this cross-linked product was strictly dependent on the presence of dimerized βγ subunits, and its mobility on SDS-PAGE was very close to the mobility of the well characterized cross-linked βγ band obtained with βγ subunits purified from brain (Thomas et al., 1993b). We therefore believed that it corresponded to cross-linked βγ (Spring and Neer, 1994). Fig. 4 summarizes the results obtained when we treated with BMH β1γ2 dimers containing either wild type or mutant β subunits. All mutants were tested, but for simplicity only some of them are shown; the rest behaved like the wild type. Mutation of Cys271, which affected one of the two cross-linked αβ bands (see Fig. 3), also inhibits the formation of the ~50-kDa cross-linked product. This result was puzzling for us, because previous experimental evidence suggested that γ was being cross-linked to the 14-kDa amino-terminal tryptic fragment of β (Thomas et al., 1993b), whereas Cys271 would be in the carboxyl-terminal 24-kDa fragment. Therefore, to characterize this cross-linked product further and to verify its composition, we individually mutated both cysteines in γ2, Cys41 and Cys68, to alanine and serine, respectively. In addition, a double mutant was generated. The mutations did not affect the ability of the γ subunit to dimerize with β1 as deduced from the tryptic proteolysis pattern (Fig. 5A), but to our surprise, neither did they affect the cross-linking (Fig. 5B); even the dimers containing the double mutant lacking both cysteines behaved like the wild type and were able to form the ~50-kDa cross-linked product. It was however possible that BMH could be reacting with amino groups with an abnormal pKa in γ2. If this were the case it should still be possible to label the cross-linked product using [35S]γ and nonradioactive β. All the appropriate controls were done to make sure that the cross-linked product was being formed, but we still were not able to detect a radioactively labeled cross-linked band under these conditions. Immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-γ antibodies were also negative. Overall, these negative results indicated that γ was in fact not present in the ~50-kDa cross-linked product (marked by an open arrow in Fig. 1, A and B). Nevertheless, its formation was strictly correlated with the ability of the β subunit to associate with γ, and it was a reliable indicator of βγ dimerization (Spring and Neer, 1994). We concluded that the β subunit was being cross-linked through Cys271 to another small protein (which we will refer to as X) present in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate used for in vitro translation. Preliminary experiments suggest that this unidentified protein might be one of the subunits of hemoglobin (16 kDa), which is by far the most abundant protein in the reticulocyte lysate. Whether this cross-linking to β reflects any real, functional interaction between β1 and hemoglobin or is just a nonspecific reaction with a very concentrated protein remains to be clarified.Figure 5:Characterization of γ2 cysteine mutants. A, in vitro translated wild type β1 subunits were incubated with either wild type γ2 or a double mutant γ2 with no cysteines in its sequence. Dimerization was subsequently checked by trypsin digestion as described previously. The fragments were resolved on 11% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. The arrow points to the protected carboxyl-terminal β1 fragment indicative of dimer formation. Shown here is an example of four independent experiments. B, the same dimers containing wild type or mutated γ2 were cross-linked with BMH. Treated (+ BMH) and untreated (- BMH, 20 mM DTT added before BMH) samples were resolved on 9% polyacrylamide gels and processed for autoradiography. The cross-linked product is indicated by an arrow. This experiment was repeated four times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) There was a clear discrepancy between the results obtained with in vitro translated subunits, where β1 and γ2 could not be cross-linked to each other, and the results obtained with βγ dimers purified from brain, where β could be cross-linked to γ through its 14-kDa amino-terminal region (Thomas et al., 1993b). A major difference between the two samples is the composition of the βγ dimers; whereas the in vitro translated samples contain dimers of defined composition (in this case β1γ2), the purified dimers are made up of different β and γ isoforms present in brain, including β1 and β2 (Fong et al., 1987) and γ2, γ3, γ5, and γ7 (Cali et al., 1992; Wilcox et al., 1994). The two β subtypes show a high degree of similarity throughout their sequences. The γ subunits are much more heterogeneous; in fact γ3 contains two additional cysteines (not present in γ1, γ2, γ5, or γ7) flanking the equivalent of Cys41 in γ2 (see diagram in Fig. 6). It was therefore possible that because of those extra cysteines, γ3 but not γ2 could be cross-linked to β1 by BMH. Indeed, when we treated in vitro translated and dimerized β1γ3 with BMH, we obtained a cross-linked product with exactly the same apparent molecular mass as the purified cross-linked dimer (Fig. 7, solid arrow). Moreover, the cross-linked product could be labeled with either [35S]β1 and nonradioactive γ3 or nonradioactive β1 and [35S]γ3 (Fig. 8, C and D, lower part of gel), indicating that it contains both β and γ subunits. Note that the intensity of the β1γ3 cross-linked band (closed arrow in Fig. 7) is greater than the β1X band obtained with β1γ2 (open arrow in Fig. 7), which is also present in the lanes corresponding to β1γ3 (see Figure 7:, Figure 8:, faint band right above βγ). As expected, it does not appear when only γ is radioactively labeled (Fig. 8D)Figure 7:Comparison of cross-linked products obtained with βγ dimers purified from brain and β1γ2 or β1γ3 dimers translated in vitro. Purified βγ subunits or in vitro translated dimers of defined composition (β1γ2 or β1γ3) were treated in parallel with or without cross-linker, and the resulting products were resolved on 9% polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Blue. Lanes containing in vitro translated subunits were further processed for autoradiography as described. The arrowhead points to the radioactive band corresponding to β1. The position of the cross-linked products is indicated by closed and open arrows. The same experiment was repeated three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8:Characterization of cross-linked products obtained with β1γ3 dimers. β1 and γ3 subunits were separately translated in vitro in the presence (∗) or the absence of [35S]methionine, and dimers were formed in which either both subunits (B) or just one of them (C and D) were radioactively labeled. The dimers were then mixed with purified αo and incubated with cross-linker (+ BMH) or with 20 mM DTT added before the cross-linker (- BMH). The cross-linked products were resolved on 9% polyacrylamide gels and subjected to autoradiography. For comparison a β1γ2 sample treated similarly is included (A). Cross-linked products are indicated by arrows. With γ3 (but not γ2), we observed an additional cross-linked product at about 60 kDa. It contains both β and γ and is not dependent on the presence of α. It may represent βγ cross-linked to another protein in the reticulocyte lysate or multimers of βγ. It was not characterized further. This is a representative example of three independent experiments. Shown in the inset are the bands obtained after cross-linking with BMH purified αo to purified βγ subunits labeled with 125I-Bolton-Hunter (Thomas et al., 1993b). The samples were run on a 9% polyacrylamide gel, which was subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to autoradiographic film for 2 days. Only the fragment of the gel including those cross-linked products is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to determine which cysteine residue in β1 is really cross-linked to γ3, we tested the β1 cysteine mutants again but this time using γ3 instead of γ2 (Fig. 9, lower part; the effect of mutations on the αβ cross-link will be discussed below). The ability of all β1 mutants to dimerize with γ3 was confirmed with a trypsin digestion assay (data not shown). Fig. 9 shows the cross-linking results obtained with the most significant β1 mutants, the rest being indistinguishable from the wild type. The C271A mutant, which failed to generate the ~50-kDa cross-linked product in experiments with γ2 (see Fig. 4), could however be cross-linked to γ3. Conversely, mutation of Cys25 in β1, which showed no phenotype when tested with γ2 (data not shown), completely abolished the β1γ3 cross-linking. Therefore, γ3 is cross-linked to β1 through Cys25, which lies within the 14-kDa amino-terminal β tryptic fragment as shown in our previous studies with purified protein (Thomas et al., 1993b). We next sought to establish which one of the two additional cysteine residues in γ3 (Cys30 or Cys50; see diagram in Fig. 6) conferred the ability to be cross-linked to β by BMH. Following the same strategy, we individually mutated both cysteines to alanines and used tryptic protection assays to confirm that the mutants could still dimerize with β1 (Fig. 10A). Subsequently, we cross-linked β1γ3 dimers containing either wild type or mutant γ3 subunits and showed that mutation of Cys30 but not Cys50 prevents the formation of the cross-linked βγ band (Fig. 10B, lower part). This cysteine residue in γ3 (Cys30) is not present in any of the other γ subtypes and therefore confers a distinctive property to γ3. When the β1γ3 dimers were cross-linked to αo, two new cross-linker-specific products became evident (see Fig. 8upper half, sets B and C). They migrate just above the two previously described bands corresponding to cross-linked αβ (see diagram in Fig. 11). Moreover, they could be labeled using either [35S]β or [35S]γ (Fig. 8, upper half, sets C and D), showing that besides α these two new products contain both β and γ subunits. We believe they result from cross-linking β to both α and γ, which would explain why they could not be detected in experiments carried out with γ2 (see Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:) that cannot be cross-linked to β. The same products should however be found after cross-linking purified αβγ subunits. Coomassie staining was not sensitive enough to detect them and gave only faint signals. Whereas all βγ dimers can be cross-linked to α, only a fraction of them, those containing γ3, can produce a βγ cross-link and generate the upper αβγ cross-linked bands. Therefore, in cross-linking experiments with purified subunits, cross-linked αβγ is less abundant than cross-linked αβ. Iodination of purified βγ dimers with 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent, which reacts strongly with the γ subunit (Thomas et al., 1993b), allows us to detect all the expected αβ and αβγ products (see Fig. 8, inset). Note that in experiments with in vitro translated subunits, the stronger intensity of the bands corresponding to the two cross-linked αβγ products as compared with the two αβ products (see Fig. 8, set B) reflects the presence of additional radioactively labeled methionines (from the γ3 subunit) in those products. When only the β subunit is radioactive (Fig. 8, set C), the four cross-linked products are approximately equally labeled. Which are the cysteine residues involved in the formation of those two new cross-linked products? Our hypothesis was that the two new products were the result of attaching γ to the two previously described forms of cross-linked αβ. If this were the case, the same β cysteine mutations that prevented the formation of the two lower bands (Cys204 and Cys271) should also affect the two additional upper bands. That is exactly what we observed when we tested the β mutants dimerized with γ3 in a cross-linking assay in the presence of αo (see Fig. 9, upper part). The C204A mutant failed to produce the upper of the two αβ bands (as we had previously established) as well as the upper of the two αβγ bands (for schematic representation of the four products, see Fig. 11). Conversely, C271A mutant failed to produce the lower of the two αβ bands and the lower of the two αβγ bands. As expected, mutation of Cys25 blocked the formation of the three bands containing γ leaving the other three (the two cross-linked αβ bands and βX) unaffected. Finally, the results with the γ3 cysteine mutants (see Fig. 10B, upper part) confirmed that the same cysteine involved in the βγ cross-linking (Cys30) is responsible for the formation of the two cross-linked αβγ bands. Fig. 11 summarizes the results obtained during the characterization of the six major cross-linked products obtained with in vitro translated G protein subunits; starting from below the first band corresponds to β cross-linked to γ3 through Cys25, γ3 being in turn covalently bound to β through Cys30. Right above is β cross-linked to a rabbit reticulocyte lysate protein (X) through Cys271. The higher molecular mass bands, starting from the bottom, correspond to β cross-linked to α through Cys271 (lower band) and through Cys204 (upper band) followed by β cross-linked to both α and γ again through Cys271 or Cys204 (to α) and through Cys25 (to γ). We have individually mutated the cysteine residues in β1, γ2, and γ3 to alanine (or to serine in one case) and shown that none of those residues are needed for βγ dimerization or for interaction of βγ with the α subunit. Cys25 in β1 can be cross-linked to Cys30 in γ3 with BMH. Therefore, it is likely that those two cysteines are facing each other. Cys25 in β1 can also form a cupric phenantroline-catalyzed disulfide bond with either Cys35 or Cys36 in γ1, although it is not known which one of those two cysteines reacts with β1 (Bubis and Khorana, 1990). Because a disulfide bond is only about 2 Å long, Cys25 in β1 must be very close to either Cys35 or Cys36 in γ1. If the conformations of γ1 and γ3 are similar, then the amino acids in γ3 that are the equivalent of Cys35 and Cys36 in γ1 (Ala37 and Ala38 in γ3) should also be close to β1. Because we have shown that Cys30 in γ3 can be cross-linked to β1, we propose that Ala37 and Ala38 lie on the same surface of γ3 as Cys30 and that all face the β subunit. Defining that surface will help identify what part of γ3 is exposed and is therefore likely to be involved in interaction with other proteins such as the α subunit or effectors. The residues in β1 and γ3 that are cross-linked to each other (Cys25 in β1 and Cys30 in γ3) lie within regions believed to be important for dimerization. The minimum sequence of γ necessary to form a native βγ dimer is not known. However, removal of 15 amino acids from the amino terminus diminishes but does not entirely block dimerization, whereas removal of 13 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus has little effect (Mende et al., 1995). Therefore, residues important to contact β probably lie between amino acids 15 and 59. The sequence that defines the selectivity of βγ interactions is also located in this central region (Spring and Neer, 1994; Lee et al., 1995). Mutations in the putative amino-terminal α-helix in β1, where Cys25 is located, can inhibit βγ dimerization (Garritsen et al., 1993). However, selectivity for different γ subunits is determined by multiple sites within the WD repeat region of the β subunit (Pronin and Gautam, 1992; Garritsen and Simonds, 1994; Katz and Simon, 1995). γ1 and γ2 cannot be cross-linked to β1 by BMH. Neither they nor any of the other known γ subtypes including the newly cloned isoforms (Ong et al., 1995; Ryba and Tirindelli, 1995; Ray et al., 1995) contain a cysteine at a position equivalent to Cys30 of γ3. Therefore, in any preparation, formation of a cross-linked βγ product after treatment with BMH suggests the presence of βγ3 dimers. This distinctive property could in turn be used to probe for interaction of βγ dimers containing γ3 with other proteins. We have identified two cysteine residues in β1 (Cys204 and Cys271) that can be cross-linked to αo with BMH. Our previous studies show that both cross-linked products involve the same cysteine in αo (Cys215) (Thomas et al., 1993a). The distance from Cys215 in αo to either Cys204 or Cys271 in β1 cannot be longer than 16 Å, the length of the cross-linking reagent, but the flexibility of BMH would allow it to be slightly smaller. The amount of the two αβ cross-linked products is usually about equal, suggesting that the probability of the cross-linker reaching each of the two residues in β is similar. Alternatively, the two cross-linking sites in β could reflect two different conformations of the heterotrimer, although there is as yet no experimental evidence for differences in βγ conformation. The two cross-linked cysteines are located in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the β subunit, in agreement with our previous observation with purified subunits that after tryptic digestion of the cross-linked products the α subunit remains associated with the 24-kDa carboxyl-terminal β fragment (Yi et al., 1991). Cys204 is found in the fourth WD repeat, whereas Cys271 lies within repeat six. Both are likely to be found in turns. The spatial organization of the seven WD repeats in β is not known. It is clear however that βγ forms a very tightly associated globular structure (Thomas et al. 1993b). Any model of the βγ dimer must be compatible with Cys215, located in the α2 helix of the α subunit, reaching Cys204 in the fourth repeat and Cys271 in the sixth repeat through an arm of approximately 16 Å (see Fig. 12). The two cysteines are probably not providing bonds to hold α and β together because they can be mutated without disrupting the αβ association. Our findings, however, begin to define an area in β that faces the α subunit, and they pose structural constraints to any model of the configuration of the β subunit. We thank Drs. R. R. Reed and M.

The correct spelling is shown above. Full-Text PDF Open Access The β6 hemoglobin variants, in particular, sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS) and HbC, are aggregating hemoglobins and, for decades, have been of interest to structural biologists, pathophysiologists, and clinicians. HbC is the second most commonly encountered abnormal hemoglobin in the United States and, next to HbS and HbE, the third most prevalent hemoglobin variant worldwide(1.Bunn H.F. Forget B.G. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1986Google Scholar). HbC (Gluβ6→ Lys) shares with HbS (Gluβ6→ Val) the site of mutation at position β6, but the consequences of the specific substitutions are very different. In red blood cells, deoxygenated HbS forms polymers, whereas HbC forms intraerythrocytic crystals in the oxygenated state as demonstrated by absorption spectroscopy as well as by their tendency to melt upon deoxygenation(2.Hirsch R.E. Raventos-Suarez C. Olson J.A. Nagel R.L. Blood. 1985; 66: 775-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, to date, no structural basis for the abnormal properties of these mutant hemoglobins has been defined (3.Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In this study, we focus upon conformational changes in HbC as a means of addressing the remaining questions: is the localized β6 mutation alone responsible for the tendency of HbC to crystallize, or does this mutation induce extended tertiary and/or quaternary conformational changes necessary for crystallization? Hence, to investigate possible dynamic distal conformational changes in HbC compared with HbA, several optical spectroscopies were sequentially used in this study to probe conformational differences in liganded HbC. Hemolysates from AC and CC individuals' washed red blood cells were made by freeze-thawing with the cellular debris separated by centrifugation. The hemoglobins were separated and purified on a Whatman CM52 column as described previously (4.Schroeder W.A. Huisman T.H.J. The Chromatography of Hemoglobin. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1980: 61Google Scholar), and the isolation was verified by isoelectric focusing. The separation of both HbC and HbA from the same AC hemolysates ensures a proper control. The fluorescence emission of the hemoglobins was obtained using an SLM-AMINCO 8000C photon-counting spectrofluorometer with a front-face accessory(5.Hirsch R.E. Zukin R.S. Nagel R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 93: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6.Hirsch R.E. Nagel R.L. J. Biol.

The excitation is at 296 nm, which selectively excites for Trp fluorescence, eliminating the contribution of tyrosines to the fluorescence spectrum(8.Eisinger J. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3902-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Hemoglobin solutions were 1 g %, wherein the hemoglobin dissociation equilibrium is shifted largely to tetramers. Experiments were conducted at pH 6.85 in 0.1 M Hepes buffer. Under these conditions, crystallization will not occur within the time period of the measurements. The UV resonance Raman spectrometer is composed of a laser source, a 1.5-m single spectrograph equipped with a 3600 groove/mm holographic grating, and a liquid N2-cooled CCD detector (Princeton Instruments Inc., Princeton, NJ). The CCD detector has a UV metachrome coating on its chip. The modified intracavity frequency-doubled ring dye laser (Coherent 899) utilizing stilbeen 420 is pumped by a multi-UV line output of an argon laser (Coherent Innova 400). To maximize the UV output with acceptable bandwidth, a thin etalon was used instead of two etalons (thick and thin). This laser system generated CW UV output from 218 to 240 nm. The maximum output of this system at 226 nm is 6 milliwatts. The average UV power used is ~1.2 milliwatts, proven to be sufficient for acquiring high quality Raman spectra. The sample was contained in a quartz NMR tube for data collection, maintained at 10°C, and spun in helical fashion at 5 Hz to minimize local heating and potential photodegradation. The scattered photons were collected with a triplet lens (Fused Suprasil, CVI Laser Corp.) and focused onto the entrance slit (200 μm) of the spectrograph (Sopra, Inc.). The wavenumber shift was calibrated with the use of the Raman spectra of cyclohexane and 1,4-dioxane. Spectral acquisitions were carried out as a series of 5-min accumulation; each final spectrum was the sum of three to five of these 5-min spectra. Before summing the spectra, cosmic rays were removed from each spectrum using SpectralCal software (Galactic Industries Corp.). In addition, each spectrum was subtracted from the first one taken from a given sample. If differences were observed, the spectrum was discarded. All measurements were made at room temperature (23°C) in cylindrical quartz or sapphire cells 0.2 mm in width. These measurements were repeated on two separate occasions exhibiting identical spectral patterns. For calibration purposes before and after each sample measurement, Raman spectra were generated of organic solvents with known spectral characteristics. For the low frequency spectra, a 1:1 (w/w) mixture of CH2Br2+ CHBr3, was used and for the high frequency region, indene (C9H8) was used. Resonance Raman spectroscopic measurements were obtained using the following system. The second harmonic (532 nm, 20 Hz) of a neodymium:YAG laser (Continuum NY-81C) passed through a hydrogen cell (200 p.s.i.) was used to generate the blue (435.71 nm) pulse (~1 ml, 7-ns pulses). A single laser pulse photolyzes the sample and probes the Raman spectrum of the transients within ~7 ns. Scattered light was collected with a Nikon F/1.4 50-mm camera lens and focused with an f-matching lens onto a 150-μm entrance slit of an ISA HR640 monochrometer. A notch filter was used to reduce the Raleigh scattering, and a depolarizer was used to reduce grating biases. The detector was a Princeton Instruments 1024 element intensified diode array (IRY 1024 S/B) connected to a Princeton Instruments ST120 detector controller interfaced to a personal computer, where the spectra were stored and later analyzed with LabCalc software (Galactic Industries Corp.). Front-face fluorescence (5.Hirsch R.E. Zukin R.S. Nagel R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 93: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6.Hirsch R.E. Nagel R.L. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) has been used to probe changes in both the environment of tryptophans and heme-Trp distances in hemoglobins(9.Gryczynski Z. Tenenholz T. Bucci E. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 648-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The first positive findings were obtained comparing the intrinsic fluorescence intensities of the oxy and deoxy forms of HbA and HbC as shown in Fig. 1. 296 nm excitation was used to eliminate any resonance energy transfer from Tyr → Trp(9.Gryczynski Z. Tenenholz T. Bucci E. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 648-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A significant difference (p = 0.0035) in the fluorescence emission intensity of oxyHbC and oxyHbA is observed. This is not the case for the deoxy derivatives. A significant difference (p = 0.00008) in the percent change in the fluorescence intensity of HbC compared with HbA upon deoxygenation is also shown in Fig. 1, but is accounted for by the initial intensity difference between the liganded species. This difference in the intrinsic fluorescence can arise from any of the Trp residues (Trpα14, Trpβ15, and Trpβ37) within Hb. It is also possible that this difference may arise from differences in orientation and efficiency of transfer from tryptophan(s) to the heme. Hence, to further localize the origin of the increase in fluorescence, we used conformationally sensitive vibrational spectra of tryptophans and tyrosines using UV resonance Raman spectroscopy(10.Rodgers K.R. Su C. Subamanian S. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3697-3709Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11.Asher S.A. Annu. Rev. Phys.

Biol. 1992; 58: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), building on the findings of Spiro and co-workers(10.Rodgers K.R. Su C. Subamanian S. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3697-3709Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13.Rodgers K.R. Spiro T.G. Science. 1994; 265: 1697-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These authors showed that the distinct low frequency shoulder of the Trp(W3) UV resonance Raman band at ~1550 cm-1 arises from Trpβ37, whereas the main band at ~1555 cm-1 is derived from the composite contribution of Trpα14/β15. Fig. 2 shows a comparison of the UV resonance Raman spectra of the liganded (CO) forms of HbA compared with HbC. All differences can be attributed to the Trp(W3)α14/β15 band since no other spectral differences are observed. Visible resonance Raman spectroscopy is used to probe the functionally important heme environment(14.Rousseau D.L. Ondrias M.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1983; 12: 357-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15.Rousseau D.L. Friedman J.M. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Scattering. III.

This method probes heme vibrational modes, many of which are highly sensitive to the local tertiary structure. It is used here to resolve any differences, between HbC and HbA, in the heme and local heme environment that could contribute to the observed fluorescence alteration. Comparisons between the equilibrium deoxy forms and the photoproducts of ligand-bound forms reflect both ligand binding and quaternary structure-induced changes in the heme environment. The low frequency region contains the iron-proximal histidine stretching mode, which is highly sensitive to changes in the functionally important proximal heme pocket. Other bands in the low frequency region reflect the environment of the vinyl and propionate groups. The high frequency region contains modes that are sensitive to the iron displacement and the π electron density of the porphyrin ring(14.Rousseau D.L. Ondrias M.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1983; 12: 357-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15.Rousseau D.L. Friedman J.M. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Scattering. III. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 133-217Google Scholar). Fig. 3(a and b) shows that the high and low frequency regions of the resonance Raman spectra of both the equilibrium deoxy form and the 10-ns transient photoproduct of HbA and HbC are identical within our spectral resolution. Identical proximal and distal heme pocket environments would be consistent with the recent report by Shapiro et al.(17.Shapiro D.B. Paquette S.J. Esquerra R.M. Che D. Goldbeck R.A. Hirsch R.E. Mohandas N. Kliger D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) that there are no differences between HbA and HbC with respect to CO geminate recombination kinetics (10-ns resolution). Geminate rebinding has been shown to be sensitive to both proximal (18.Friedman J.M. Scott T.W. Fisanick G.F. Simon S.R. Findsen E.W. Ondrias M.R. Macdonald V.W. Science. 1985; 229: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and distal (19.Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (728) Google Scholar) perturbations. Considering all of the above, a difference in heme orientation between HbC and HbA is an unlikely mechanism to explain the increased fluorescence. In summary, based on the increase in the intrinsic fluorescence of oxygenated HbC and the lack of differences in the heme environment as demonstrated by the visible resonance Raman spectroscopy and CO geminate rebinding kinetics(17.Shapiro D.B. Paquette S.J. Esquerra R.M. Che D. Goldbeck R.A. Hirsch R.E. Mohandas N. Kliger D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), it is likely that differences exist between oxyHbA and oxyHbC in the microenvironment of at least one tryptophan. Trpβ37, a possible candidate since it contributes to the intrinsic fluorescence of Hb using 296 nm excitation(3.Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv.

Commun. 1981; 100: 1259-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), can be eliminated since the UV resonance Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 2) shows no HbA/HbC difference involving this residue. In contrast, a substantial intensity difference is apparent at the peak assigned to either Trpα14 or Trpβ15 (which are not distinguishable by this technique). Given that the β6 mutation is on the same helix as Trpβ15, we conclude that Trpβ15 is the source of the change in signal in both the fluorescence and UV resonance Raman spectra. Trpβ15 is an A helix residue that lies in the crevice formed by the A and E helices and normally forms a hydrogen bond with Serβ72 of the E helix in both the deoxy and oxy structures(13.Rodgers K.R. Spiro T.G. Science. 1994; 265: 1697-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Based on the analysis of Rodgers and Spiro(13.Rodgers K.R. Spiro T.G. Science. 1994; 265: 1697-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the UV resonance Raman data presented here are interpreted as a weakening of this hydrogen bond in oxyHbC. In addition, the increased fluorescence intensity pattern for oxyHbC is consistent with Trp being farther away from the heme, with the A helix looser or more distant. Finally, as reported in the transient resonance Raman studies, there are no detectable differences in the heme environment between HbA and HbC in either the deoxy T state or liganded R state as reflected in the transient photoproduct spectrum. Therefore, the proximal heme pocket of the liganded R structure does not appear to be altered as a result of the Lysβ6 substitution within the 10-ns timeframe. The Raman data presented here, the observation that HbC and HbA are functionally identical, and the findings by Shapiro et al.(17.Shapiro D.B. Paquette S.J. Esquerra R.M. Che D. Goldbeck R.A. Hirsch R.E. Mohandas N. Kliger D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) indicating no difference in the CO geminate recombination of HbC compared with HbA indicate that both the proximal and distal heme pocket architectures are indistinguishable in these two proteins. Hence, the perturbation of the the A helix alteration is not transmitted to the critical heme interactions with the E and F helices. We conclude that the weakened hydrogen bond between the A and E helices, reflected by UV resonance Raman spectroscopy, involving Trpβ15 of the A helix and Serβ72 of the E helix and induced by the Lysβ6 replacement, in turn induces a swinging away of the A helix from the E helix, with the E helix remaining unperturbed (Fig. 4). The absence of comparable differences for the deoxy derivatives could be due to the known increase in the tightness of packing between the EF corner and the N terminus in the deoxy T state, which could be sufficient to maintain the A helix in its standard configuration relative to the E helix. This model is adopted as the simplest explanation that accounts for our observations and incorporates physical and chemical intuition. Other possible alternative mechanisms to explain the observed fluorescence difference are unlikely in light of the following. 1) A different heme orientation is ruled out by the lack of differences in the visible resonance Raman spectra and by the work of others(17.Shapiro D.B. Paquette S.J. Esquerra R.M. Che D. Goldbeck R.A. Hirsch R.E. Mohandas N. Kliger D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). 2) Resonance energy transfer from Tyr → Trp is ruled out by the use of 296 nm excitation, which selectively excites Trp(8.Eisinger J. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3902-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). 3) Differences in Trpβ37 are ruled out as the origin of the fluorescence change by the UV resonance Raman data. Although the resonance Raman cross-section depends on the absorption spectra while fluorescence quantum yield mechanisms depend upon resonance energy transfer rate efficiency, this study exemplifies the strength by which these two spectroscopic approaches may serve to complement each other in the search for assignments. Finally, the altered packing of the A helix in oxyHbC becomes a likely focus for mechanistic studies dealing with the increased tendency of oxyHbC to crystallize. Moreover, these results suggest that sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS, Gluβ6→ Val) should be revisited in terms of delocalized conformational changes inducing deoxyHbS polymerization, particularly considering earlier reports implying nonpolymerization-related functional differences between tetrameric HbS and HbA(22.Fung L.W.-M.

Mice bearing the inactive protease coding sequence displayed no gross abnormalities in the lens, while mice with the active protease developed time-dependent bilateral cataracts. One line, TG61, developed cataracts in utero while the second line, TG72, developed cataracts postnatally. TG61 mice, homozygous for the transgene, developed severe microphthalmia and were significantly smaller than the control mice at postnatal day 30. two-dimensional-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the protein profiles of TG72 and TG61 lenses revealed extensive modifications in the lens crystallins. Proteolysis in the homozygous TG72 mouse lenses began at postnatal day 20 with the disappearance or partial loss of βB1-, βB3-, and βA3-crystallins and the appearance of crystallin fragments. Protein leakage and the gradual breakdown of cytoskeletal elements also occurred. In contrast, the opacification of the homozygous TG61 lenses appeared to have been influenced by differentiation and developmental processes.

https://openalex.org/W1519380141,"The activation of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdks) is dependent upon site-specific phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions, as well as positive and negative regulatory subunits. The human Cdk-activating protein kinase (Cak1) is itself a Cdc2-related cyclin-dependent protein kinase that associates with cyclin H. The present study utilized specific anti-Cak1 antibodies and immunoaffinity chromatography to identify additional Cak1-associated proteins and potential target substrates. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled human osteosarcoma cells revealed a number of Cak1-associated proteins, including p95, p37 (cyclin H), and a 35-kDa protein that was further characterized herein. Microsequence analysis obtained after limited proteolysis revealed peptide fragments that are similar, but not identical to, human and yeast cyclins, thus identifying p35 as a cyclin-like regulatory subunit. The greatest sequence similarity of human p35 is with Mcs2, a yeast cyclin that is essential for cell cycle progression. Immunoaffinity chromatography performed under nondenaturing conditions afforded the isolation of enzymatically active Cak1 from cell lysates, enabling studies of kinase autophosphorylation and comparative substrate utilization. Immunoaffinity-purified Cak1 phosphorylated monomeric Cdc2 and Cdk2, but not Cdk4; the phosphorylation of both Cdc2 and Cdk2 were increased in the presence of recombinant cyclin A. These studies indicate that the Cak1 catalytic subunit, like Cdc2 and Cdk2, associates with multiple regulatory partners and suggests that subunit composition may be an important determinant of this multifunctional enzyme. The activation of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdks) is dependent upon site-specific phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions, as well as positive and negative regulatory subunits. The human Cdk-activating protein kinase (Cak1) is itself a Cdc2-related cyclin-dependent protein kinase that associates with cyclin H. The present study utilized specific anti-Cak1 antibodies and immunoaffinity chromatography to identify additional Cak1-associated proteins and potential target substrates. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled human osteosarcoma cells revealed a number of Cak1-associated proteins, including p95, p37 (cyclin H), and a 35-kDa protein that was further characterized herein. Microsequence analysis obtained after limited proteolysis revealed peptide fragments that are similar, but not identical to, human and yeast cyclins, thus identifying p35 as a cyclin-like regulatory subunit. The greatest sequence similarity of human p35 is with Mcs2, a yeast cyclin that is essential for cell cycle progression. Immunoaffinity chromatography performed under nondenaturing conditions afforded the isolation of enzymatically active Cak1 from cell lysates, enabling studies of kinase autophosphorylation and comparative substrate utilization. Immunoaffinity-purified Cak1 phosphorylated monomeric Cdc2 and Cdk2, but not Cdk4; the phosphorylation of both Cdc2 and Cdk2 were increased in the presence of recombinant cyclin A. These studies indicate that the Cak1 catalytic subunit, like Cdc2 and Cdk2, associates with multiple regulatory partners and suggests that subunit composition may be an important determinant of this multifunctional enzyme. INTRODUCTIONCritical transitions in the eukaryotic cell cycle are regulated by patterns of protein phosphorylation events governed predominantly by the catalytic activities of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdks) 1The abbreviations used are: Cdkcyclin-dependent protein kinasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered salineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. (Norbury and Nurse, 1992; Meyerson et al., 1992; Reed, 1992; Pines, 1993; Dorée and Galas, 1994). The activities of these Cdks are themselves regulated by site-specific phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions (Krek and Nigg, 1991; Norbury et al., 1991; Solomon, 1993) as well as the association with positive (i.e. cyclins) (Hunt, 1991; Wu et al., 1993; Sherr, 1993; Draetta, 1994) and negative (i.e. Cdk inhibitors) (Elledge and Harper, 1994; Peter and Herskowitz, 1994; Xiong et al., 1993) regulatory subunits. An essential phosphoregulatory site, deduced from genetic studies in yeast, was identified within the T-fold of kinase subdomain VIII (Marcote et al., 1993; DeBondt et al., 1993) of Cdc2 (at Thr-161) and Cdk2 (at Thr-160) and whose phosphorylation is required for the generation of Cdc2/Cdk2 kinase activity (Krek et al., 1992; Gu et al., 1992; Connell-Crowley et al., 1993). Subsequent studies have identified a distinctive Cdc2/Cdk2-activating protein kinase (CAK) in Xenopus oocytes, MO15 (Shuttleworth et al., 1990; Poon et al., 1993; Solomon et al., 1993), and human tumor cells (Solomon et al., 1993; Williams et al., 1993a, 1993b). The catalytic subunit of the human CAK (Cak1) has been cloned and is found to be structurally related to Cdc2(Hs) (Wu et al., 1994). Human Cak1 has been shown to complex with at least one regulatory subunit, cyclin H (Fisher and Morgan, 1994; Mäkelä et al., 1994), revealing a vectorial cascade of cyclin-dependent protein kinases.Other recent studies suggest that Cak1 functions in transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and tumor suppression, in addition to its role in regulating cell cycle progression.However, numerous questions remain regarding the subunit configuration(s), biochemical activation, substrate specificity, and physiological targets of this key regulatory enzyme. Pronounced disparities in the published literature concerning the molecular mass of the Cak1 complexes (Solomon et al., 1992; Poon et al., 1993; Williams et al., 1994; Wu et al., 1994), the nature and identity of its regulatory subunit(s) (Mäkeläet al., 1994; Tassan et al., 1994), the phosphorylation of putative target substrates, including monomeric Cdc2 (Dorée and Galas, 1994; Fisher and Morgan, 1994) and Cdk4 (Kato et al., 1994; Matsuoka et al., 1994), and the regulation of its enzymatic activity (Fisher and Morgan, 1994; Matsuoka et al., 1994; Williams et al., 1994), suggest that our understanding of this key regulatory enzyme system is still incomplete.Using the deduced amino acid structure of (Hs)Cak1 (Wu et al., 1994), we developed anti-peptide antibodies that are selective for the p42cak1 subunit and have characterized the performance of these antibodies for both immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. In this study, we used anti-Cak1 antibodies and immunoaffinity chromatography to investigate the enzyme activities of purified Cak1 and to further characterize Cak1-associated proteins. In addition to verifying high molecular weight complexes reported previously (Williams et al., 1993a, 1993b) and the association of a 37-kDa protein identified as cyclin H (Mäkeläet al., 1994; Fisher and Morgan, 1994), we detected a distinctive 35-kDa protein in association with p42cak1. Isolation, fragmentation, and microsequence analysis of p35 revealed that this Cak1-associated protein exhibits amino acid sequence homologies to human cyclin H and yeast Mcs2; indicating that p35 is indeed a cyclin-like regulatory subunit that is related to, but distinct from, cyclin H.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsCell Cultures and Cell SynchronizationHuman MG-63 and TE-85 osteosarcoma cells were obtained from the American Type Cell Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, MD). The MG-63 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin, and streptomycin, and the TE-85 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics, at 37°C, in 5% CO2 humidified air. MG-63 cells were synchronized by serum deprivation, as described previously (Carbonaro-Hall et al., 1993). Hela S-3 cells, grown as large scale suspension cultures, were obtained from the University of Southern California Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C prior to use.Recombinant Plasmids and Synthetic PeptidesThe expression vectors encoding the glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins glutathione S-transferase-Cdc2 and glutathione S-transferase-Cdk2, and the epitope-tagged HA-Cdk4, have been described elsewhere (Connell-Crowley et al., 1993). Polymerase chain reaction-derived full coding sequences of human cyclin H (Fisher and Morgan, 1994; Mäkeläet al., 1994) were ligated into the pET-28 expression vector (Novagen) and maintained in XL Blue strain of E. coli. For expression of the His-tagged human cyclin H fusion protein, the plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) strain E. coli, and recombinant protein expression was induced by incubation in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Anti-peptide antisera, directed against the first 15 amino acids of human cyclin H (Fisher and Morgan, 1994) was raised in rabbits. The synthetic peptide corresponding in sequence to residues 151-170 of the human p34cdc2 (Lee and Nurse, 1987), as well as the Ala-162 congener, was chemically synthesized and coupled to Affi-Gel 10 as described previously (Williams et al., 1994).MethodsMetabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and ImmunoblottingFor 35S labeling of cellular proteins, TE-85 and MG-63 osteosarcoma cells in log phase growth were washed twice with prewarmed methionine-free and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN) and were preincubated in this media supplemented to 0.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min at 37°C. [35S]Met/Cys (1 mCi/ml; ICN) was added directly to the culture media to effect a final concentration of 100 μCi/ml, and the cell cultures were incubated for 4 h at 37°C. Following metabolic labeling, the cells were washed twice to remove exogenous label prior to cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and visualization of the immune complexes by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Cell lysates were prepared from fresh monolayer cultures as follows. The cells were washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution and lysed in a small volume (1 ml/75-cm2 culture flask) of IP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EGTA, 25 mM sodium fluoride, 25 mM β-glycerolphosphate, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.3% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and clarified by centrifugation (20,000 × g) for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected for Western blotting, in vitro kinase assays, immunoprecipitation studies, and column chromatography.For immunoprecipitations, MG-63 and TE-85 cells were cultured and lysed as described above, and the lysate was clarified by incubation with 50 μl (1:1 slurry in (1×) PBS) of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B on ice for 15 min. Immunoprecipitations and affinity precipitations were performed by incubating aliquots of the precleared lysate (supernatant) with either no antibodies (control), specific antibodies, or specific peptide-blocked antibodies for 20 min in ice with periodic mixing. The resulting immune complexes were collected by the addition of 50 μl (1:1 slurry in (1×) PBS) of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, incubation in ice for 20 min, followed by centrifugation. After washing each pellet 4 times with 750 μl of ice-cold Fast Q Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate) containing 50 mM NaCl, and once in 750 μl of ice-cold kinase assay buffer, each pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of (1×) SDS sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 40 mM dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol) containing 10 mMN-ethylmaleimide (to minimize dissociation of IgG chains), heat-denatured for 2 min at 95°C, and the solubilized proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, as described by Williams et al.(1992). The specific immunoreactivity of the newly developed anti-Cak1 antibodies were validated by competition of the antibody with the immunizing peptide as follows: approximately 400 μg of the immunizing peptide was mixed with anti-Cak1 IgG and preincubated for 30 min at 30°C prior to separate parallel incubations of both blocked and nonblocked antibodies for 30 min on Western blots. The resulting Western blots were developed under identical conditions.Development and Application of Anti-Cak1 AntibodiesThe C-terminal amino acids (residues 328-346) of Cak1 were chemically synthesized (Microchemical Core Facility, University of Southern California Norris Cancer Center) and conjugated to KLH (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for the immunization of rabbits to raise antisera directed against Cak1. Portions of the collected antisera were used to prepare two subsets of polyclonal antibodies: an affinity-purified fraction and an IgG fraction. To generate the affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies, the antigenic Cak1 peptide was coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) beads preequilibrated in 20 mM KPO4, pH 7.4, at room temperature, with gentle rocking for 2 h. The Affi-Gel beads were collected by centrifugation (3000 rpm × 5 min), and the reaction was quenched by the addition of 0.2 M ethanolamine and then transferred to a small column and washed with 20 volumes of filtered (1×) phosphate-buffered saline. Anti-Cak1 antisera was diluted 1:4 in 1 × PBS, filtered through 0.45 μm, and passed over the Affi-Gel beads 3 times. The beads were washed extensively with 10 volumes filtered (1×) PBS, and the anti-Cak1 antibodies were eluted using 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.7, collected in 0.5-ml fractions. The fractions were monitored for protein content (Bio-Rad), and those containing affinity-purified antibodies were pooled and aliquoted for storage at −20 C until use. To purify polyclonal anti-Cak1 IgG fractions, protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (1 ml bed volume) was equilibrated with 20 volumes of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Anti-Cak1 antisera was adjusted to pH 8, diluted 1:4 with equilibration buffer, and filtered through 0.45 μm for extraction by protein A-Sepharose CL-4B as above. The antisera was passed over the resin twice, and the resin was washed with 10 volumes of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, followed by 10 volumes of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, before eluting with 100 mM glycine, pH 3.0. Fractions containing IgGs were pooled, aliquoted for later use, and stored at −20°C.Immunoaffinity ChromatographyTo prepare an anti-Cak1 immunoaffinity column, 1 ml (bed vol) of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B resin was equilibrated in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and several ml of anti-Cak1 antisera was passed over it twice. The resin was washed extensively with 0.1 M sodium borate, pH 9.0, and dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce Chemicals) was added to 20 mM to covalently bind the IgG to the resin (30 min, at room temperature, with gentle rocking). The resin was collected by centrifugation, washed with 0.2 M ethanolamine, pH 8.0, and allowed to block in ethanolamine for 2 h. The resin was again collected by centrifugation (2500 rpm × 5 min) and washed extensively with filtered (1×) PBS, pH 7.4. The column was preeluted with 100 mM glycine, pH 3.0, to remove noncovalently bound IgG prior to immunoaffinity chromatography.Hela S-3 cells (5-7 g pellets) were stored at −70°C until use. The cells were lysed in 20 volumes of IP buffer at 4°C and cleared by centrifugation (10 min × 20,000 × g) and filtered through 0.45 μm prior to immunoaffinity column chromatography. After the entire clarified cell lysate has passed through the column, the column was developed as follows: a 10-volume wash with IP buffer followed by 5 volumes of 1 × PBS, followed by 10 volumes of 0.3 M NaCl in IP buffer, followed by 10 volumes of 0.3 M NaCl, 30% ethylene glycol in IP buffer, followed by 5 volumes of 1 × PBS, followed by 10 volumes of 1 M MgCl2 in IP buffer, followed by 5 volumes of 1 × PBS, followed by elution with 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.7 (collected in 0.5-ml fractions). The glycine-eluted fractions containing proteins were pooled and concentrated in Amicon microconcentrators, and samples of each wash were analyzed by Western blotting. Enzymatically active Cak1 was recovered in both the NaCl/ethylene glycol and the MgCl2 eluates, as well as the NaCl wash, indicating that a substantial proportion of the anti-Cak1 peptide antibodies were low to moderate in their affinity (Kellogg and Alberts, 1992) and enabling the purification of Cak1 under nondenaturing conditions.In Vitro Protein Kinase AssaysMG-63 and TE-85 cells were cultured, lysed, and clarified as described for immunoprecipitation. After aliquots of the clarified lysates were incubated either without primary antibodies (control) or with anti-Cak1 antibodies (IgG fraction), the resulting immune complexes were collected and washed as described above. Each pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer and incubated with 100 μM [32P]ATP (specific activity at 500-1000 cpm/pmol), 10 mM magnesium acetate, with and without recombinant renatured Cdk substrates, for 30 min at 30°C with continuous agitation. The kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 × SDS sample buffer; the proteins were denatured by heating at 95°C for 5 min and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and autoradiography at −70°C using Lightning Plus or Quanta III intensifying screens (Dupont).Protein Fragmentation and Microsequence AnalysisCak1-associated proteins were isolated using Anti-Cak1 antibodies and immunoaffinity chromatography. Hela S-3 cells (7 g wet weght) were lysed in 20 volumes of ice-cold IP buffer, cleared by centrifugation, and filtered through 0.45 μm prior to application to the immunoaffinity column. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted with low pH buffer (100 mM glycine, pH 2.7). The eluate was pooled and concentrated in Amicon Centricon 10 microconcentrators, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting prior to protein microsequencing. The concentrated eluates from the immunoaffinity column were loaded directly onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis as described previously. The gel was stained with 0.05% Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma), destained, and soaked in distilled water for 1 h. The protein band, migrating at approximately 35 kDa, was excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel digestion with Achromobacter endoprotease K for 24 h at 30°C, as described previously (Kawasaki et al., 1990). The digests were cleared by centrifugation followed by filtration through a 0.22-μm membrane (Ultrafree-MC, Millipore). The peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (Hewlett Packard 1090) on a Vydac C18 column (2.1 × 250 mm, 5 μm, 300 A) attached to an anion-exchange precolumn (Brownlee GAX-013, 3.2 × 15 mm) and eluted with an acetonitrile gradient as their absorbances at 214, 280, 295, and 550 nm were monitored. Amino acid sequencing was performed on an automated microsequencer (ABI model 470) with an on-line HPLC (ABI model 120A) for the analysis of phenylthiohydantoin-tagged amino acids.RESULTSCharacterization and Application of Specific Anti-Cak1 AntibodiesThe high degree of homology conserved within the family of Cdc2-related enzymes (i.e. Cdks) necessitated the development of specific immunochemical reagents. Therefore, we developed antipeptide antibodies directed against a unique sequence in the C terminus of (Hs)Cak1 (see Fig. 1A). The resulting antipeptide antibodies readily recognized the recombinant protein on Western blots (Fig. 1B), exhibiting detection limits of ~0.1 ng under standard conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). The capability of these anti-Cak1 antibodies to detect the p42cak1 protein in Western blots of crude lysates of various rat and human cell lines was demonstrated in Fig. 1C. The levels of p42cak1 protein in the various cell lines were estimated to be ~1 ng of protein kinase subunit/10 μg of cell lysate, which is remarkably in close agreement to the levels (1:10,000) predicted by protein purification studies (Williams et al., 1994; Fisher and Morgan, 1994). Comparatively high levels of p42scak1 were detected in rat and human osteosarcoma cells (Fig. 1C), both of which exhibited additional immunoreactive protein band(s) at ~44 and ~55 kDa, possibly representing alternatively spliced or closely related isoforms of the Cak1 kinase (see Shuttleworth et al.(1990)).The anti-Cak1 antibodies efficiently precipitated the native protein, enabling further studies of Cak1-associated proteins. Immunoprecipitation experiments of [35S]Met/Cys-labeled osteosarcoma cells revealed two prominent proteins, at 37 and 35 kDa, respectively, that associate with Cak1 in potentially stoichiometric amounts (Fig. 2A), and the former has been identified as cyclin H (Mäkeläet al., 1994; Fisher and Morgan, 1994). A heavily labeled protein of 80-90 kDa, as well as several proteins in the 50-55-kDa range, were also identified as potential Cak-associated proteins. The specificity of the immunoprecipitation assay was confirmed by the use of affinity-purified antibodies (Fig. 2A, lane 3) and peptide-blocked antibodies (Fig. 2A lane 4), as well as minus antibody controls. Western blotting of the immunoprecipitates confirmed that p42cak1 was the only immunoreactive protein recognized by these antibodies (Fig. 2A, lanes 5-8) further indicating that the profile of proteins represented are physically associated with Cak1 (see “Discussion”). Further studies of Cak1-associated proteins in highly synchronized MG-63 osteosarcoma cells (Fig. 2B) confirmed the constitutive expression of p42cak1 (Wu et al., 1994) and demonstrated that both p37 (i.e. Cyclin H) and p35 remain constant in their association with Cak1 throughout the cell cycle. However, the relative abundance of the 90-95-kDa protein, as well as its electrophoretic migration pattern, appears to shift as cells proceed from G1 to S phase.Figure 2:Identification of Cak1-associated proteins in human osteosarcoma cells. A, asynchronous cultures of TE-85 osteosarcoma cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met/Cys, and the washed cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Cak1 antibodies (IgGs, lanes 2 and 6) or affinity-purified anti-Cak1 antibodies (Affi, lanes 3 and 7). The specificity of the immunoprecipitation was confirmed by minus antibody (Control, lanes 1 and 5) and by precipitation with peptide-blocked primary antibodies (+Peptide, lanes 4 and 8). The resulting immune complexes were analyzed by autoradiography (left panel). Of particular interest are the three prominent bands migrating at ~35, 37, and 42 kDa, respectively, as well as several proteins of higher molecular mass. Western analysis of the resulting immune complexes (right panel) identifies the 42-kDa protein as Cak1 and further indicates that p35 and p37 are Cak1-associated proteins. B, cell cycle dependence was examined in highly synchronized MG-63 cells (Carbonaro-Hall et al., 1993), which were lysed and analyzed by immunoprecipitation with (+) and without(-) anti-Cak1 antibodies. Based on SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (left panel), Cak1 (p42) appears to be constitutive in the cell cycle, as are its associated proteins, p37 (i.e. cyclin H), p35, p55, and p90, although p90 undergoes appreciable shifts in electrophoretic mobility in the transition from G1 to S phase. Western analysis (right panel) identifies the Cak1-associated p37 as cyclin H.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Isolation and Characterization of a Cak1-associated ProteinThe immunoprecipitation experiments were scaled up in the form of immunoaffinity column chromatography in which 7 g (~7 × 109 cells) of Hela cells were lysed and applied to an anti-Cak1 affinity matrix. The column effectively depleted a majority of the Cak1 and Cak1-associated proteins (see Fig. 3). After extensive washing and elution of bound proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”), the adsorbed immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3, lane 5, the amounts of p37 and p35 appear similar. The p35 protein band was excised from the gel and subjected to endoproteinase K digestion prior to analysis by HPLC fractionation and microsequencing of the resultant peptide fragments. Five polypeptide sequences were obtained, as follows: peptide K17, -EEALYEYQK-; peptide K6, -PQDLAAGGYK-; peptide K23, -QAFLDELETSSK-; peptide K10, -M(G/S)QHISLAPI(H)-; and peptide K12, -QPFYGLT(S)-. The amino acids within parentheses represent an uncertain reading near the detection limits of the instrument. Three of the five polypeptides aligned well with sequences of identified cyclins, as shown in Fig. 4. These sequences lie within the designated cyclin box region (Hunt, 1991), with closest similarity to the yeast cyclin Mcs2, followed by human cyclin H and human cyclin C, respectively.Figure 3:Immunoaffinity chromatography isolates Cak1 complexes from Hela cell lysates. Approximately 7 g (wet weight) of frozen Hela cells were lysed, filtered, and applied to an anti-Cak1 affinity matrix, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The affinity-purified protein complexes were eluted with 100 mM glycine, pH 2.7 (lane 4), followed by Western analysis of the various fractions and eluates for p42/Cak1 immunoreacted with the anti-Cak1 antibodies. The efficiency of Cak1 in depleting p42/Cak1 from the crude lysates is shown (compare lanes 1 and 2). Protein staining of part of the eluate indicate the relative abundance of the three proteins bands of particular interest: p42, identified as Cak1; p37, identified as Cyclin H; and p35, which remains to be characterized. The band of protein at ~35 kDa was excised and subjected to limited proteolysis by endoprotease K, followed by HPLC separation of the digests and microsequencing of the resulting peptides, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Five peptide sequences were obtained, as shown. (Parentheses indicate uncertainty.)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4:Amino acid sequence alignment of peptides derived from the Cak1-associated 35-kDa protein with identified cyclins. The amino acids sequences of three of the five peptides obtained are aligned with three of their nearest cyclin relatives: the yeast Mcs2 (Molz and Beach, 1993), the human cyclin H (Fisher and Morgan, 1994), and human cyclin C (Fisher and Morgan, 1994). The homology to Mcs2 is greater than the homology to human cyclin H and human cyclin C, suggesting that p35 may be a human homologue of the yeast cyclin, Mcs2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Immunoaffinity Purification and Elution of Enzymatically Active Cak1 under Nondenaturing ConditionsThe anti-Cak1 antibodies, which selectively immunoprecipitate Cak1 and its associated proteins from cell lysates, were used to construct immunoaffinity chromatography matrices for the purification of active Cak1 complexes from Hela S-3 cells. After extensive washing of the affinity column, immunopurified Cak1 complexes were eluted from the column under a series of increasingly harsh elution conditions to ascertain the overall affinity of the anti-peptide antibodies and to obtain a purified fraction of enzymatically active Cak1 complexes under nondenaturing conditions. As shown in Fig. 5A, the immunoaffinity matrix depleted the majority of the Cak1 present in Hela cell lysates (lanes 1 and 2). A significant amount of bound Cak1 could be eluted from the affinity matrix with buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl and 30% ethylene glycol (lane 4), while the bulk of the remaining bound Cak1 could be eluted by 1 M MgCl2 (lane 5), leaving only traces of the kinase (lane 6) on the column. The enzymatic activity of the immunoaffinity-purified Cak1 was confirmed by use of the Cdc2 Thr-161-immobilized peptide substrate assay (Williams et al., 1994), in which the NaCl/ethylene glycol eluates exhibited a 2-fold higher kinase activity (per μl) than the MgCl2 eluates, revealing an apparent specific activity approximately 10-fold higher (data not shown). In agreement with studies of purified preparations (Williams et al., 1994), substitution of the histidine residue with an alanine in the test peptide reduced the peptide kinase activity by ~90% (data not shown), confirming that the adjacent histidine residue may be an important determinant of Cak1 substrate specificity.Figure 5:Immunoaffinity chromatography yields active Cak1 complexes from Hela cell lysates. A, approximately 7 g (wet weight) of frozen Hela cells were lysed, filtered, and applied to an anti-Cak1 affinity matrix, as described under “Experimental Procedures”; the column was washed with 300 mM NaCl (lane 3), and the affinity-purified protein kinase complexes were eluted sequentially with 300 mM NaCl plus 30% ethylene glycol (lane 4), 1 M MgCl2 (lane 5), and 100 mM glycine, pH 2.7 (lane 6), followed by Western analysis of the eluates for p42cak1. The efficiency of Cak1 depletion from the crude lysates (compare lanes 1 and 2), taken together with the elution of the bulk of the bound enzyme under nondenaturing conditions, indicates that the anti-Cak1 antibodies were uniformly low to moderate in their affinity. B, immunoaffinity-purified Cak1 (MgCl2 fractions) were utilized as a source of enzyme for in vitro kinase assays performed in the presence (+) or absence(-) of recombinant cyclin A with either glutathione S-transferase-Cdc2, glutathione S-trans"
https://openalex.org/W1972933617,"Exposure of an N-terminal hydrophobic region in troponin C is thought to be important for the regulation of contraction in striated muscle. To test this hypothesis, single Cys residues were engineered at positions 45, 81, 84, or 85 in the N-terminal hydrophobic region of cardiac troponin C (cTnC) to provide specific sites for attachment of blocking groups. A synthetic peptide, Ac-Val-Arg-Ala-Ile-Gly-Lys-Leu-Ser-Ser, or biotin was coupled to these Cys residues, and the covalent adducts were tested for activity in TnC-extracted myofibrils. Covalent modification of cTnC(C45) had no effect on maximal myofibril ATPase activity. Greatly decreased myofibril ATPase activity (70-80% inhibited) resulted when the peptide was conjugated to Cys-81 in cTnC(C81), while a lesser degree of inhibition (10-25% inhibited) resulted from covalent modification of cTnC(C84) and cTnC(C85). Inhibition was not due to an altered affinity of the cTnC(C81)/peptide conjugate for the myofibrils, and the Ca2+ dependence of ATPase activity was essentially identical to the unmodified protein. Thus, a subregion of the N-terminal hydrophobic region in cTnC is sensitive to disruption, while other regions are less important or can adapt to rather bulky blocking groups. The data suggest that Ca2+-sensitizing drugs may bind to the N-terminal hydrophobic region on cTnC but not interfere with transmission of the Ca2+ signal.

The data suggest that Ca2+-sensitizing drugs may bind to the N-terminal hydrophobic region on cTnC but not interfere with transmission of the Ca2+ signal. Regulation of contraction and relaxation in vertebrate striated muscle relies on the binding and release of Ca2+ from troponin C (TnC) 1The abbreviations used are: TnCboth isoforms of troponin CcTnCcardiac troponin CsTnCfast skeletal troponin CTnItroponin IcTnIcardiac troponin IsTnIfast skeletal troponin IcTnTcardiac troponin TCaMcalmodulincTnC-BPbenzophenone-4-maleimide-labeled cTnC proteinsDTTdithiothreitolMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidSPDPsuccinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)proprionatebiotin maleimide3-(n-maleimidylpropropionyl)biocytinBP-Malbenzophenone4-maleimide. in the troponin complex.

Binding of Ca2+ or Mg2+ to the C-terminal high affinity sites in TnC facilitates tight association of TnC with thin filaments in the relaxed state(5.Zot H.G. Potter J.D. J. Biol.

Although the molecular mechanism by which TnC regulates muscle contraction has not been rigorously defined, it is thought to involve two steps. The first step is based on the molecular modeling studies of Herzberg et al.(8.Herzberg O. Moult J. James M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2638-2644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which predicted that helices B and C of TnC move away from helices A and D upon Ca2+ binding to the low affinity sites, thereby exposing a hydrophobic surface. This step of the model has found experimental support(9.Grabarek Z. Tan R.-Y. Wang J. Tao T. Gergely J. Nature. 1990; 345: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10.Fujimori K.

A. 1992; 89: 11814-11817Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and has recently been confirmed by resolution of the solution structures for apo- and Ca2+-bound sTnC(12.Gagne S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In the second step of the model, the exposed N-terminal hydrophobic region in TnC is thought to associate with a complimentary region in TnI, thereby releasing inhibition of actomyosin ATPase. This is an attractive concept, since it is analogous to the interaction of calmodulin (CaM) with a subset of target proteins. If an exposed hydrophobic region participates in the second step of the model, and is important for transmission of the Ca2+ signal, then it is logical to predict that regulation of contraction would be disrupted by ligands which bind to and block the hydrophobic surface. A number of small aromatic drugs which bind to and inhibit the activity of CaM also bind to the N-terminal hydrophobic region of isolated cTnC(13.Reid D.G. MacLachlan L.K. Gajjar K. Voyle M. King R.J. England P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9744-9753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.MacLachlan L.K. Reid D.G. Mitchell R.C. Salter C.J. Smith S.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28584-28590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these compounds sensitize, rather than inhibit, cardiac muscle contraction (16.Solaro R.J. Bousquet P. Johnson J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 238: 502-507PubMed Google Scholar, 17.El-Saleh S.C. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 403: 407-424Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of the N-terminal hydrophobic region in the mechanism of action of sTnC or cTnC is not clear. Site-specific mutation of multiple hydrophobic amino acids in the N-terminal domain of cTnC could potentially test the importance of this region, but significant artifacts could result from abnormal protein folding. To overcome these problems, we chose to covalently attach bulky groups to specific sites in the N-terminal hydrophobic region of cTnC. We then compared the functional properties of the protein conjugates with the unmodified proteins. Attachment of a synthetic peptide or biotin to single Cys residues placed at position 45, 84, or 85 had little or no functional consequence. In contrast, the activity of cTnC was greatly inhibited by coupling of these blocking groups to Cys at position 81. Thus only limited portions of the N-terminal hydrophobic region appear to be important for transmission of the Ca2+ signal. Wild-type recombinant cTnC3, cTnC(C84), and cTnC(A-Cys) were generated as described previously(3.Putkey J.A. Sweeney H.L. Campbell S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12370-12378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Putkey J.A. Dotson D.G. Mouawad P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6827-6830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression plasmids encoding cTnC proteins with single Cys residues at positions 42, 45, 81, or 85 were constructed by the method of polymerase chain reaction splicing by overlap extension (20.Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar) using a plasmid encoding cTnC(A-Cys) as a template. Sequence fidelity and mutations were confirmed by dideoxy-DNA sequencing. Mutant proteins were expressed and purified to homogeneity as described previously(21.Lin X. Krudy G.A. Howarth J. Brito R.M.M. Rosevear P.R. Putkey J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14434-14442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide, Ac-Val-Arg-Ala-Ile-Gly-Lys-Leu-Ser-Ser, was purified by reverse phase HPLC, lyophilized, and reacted with the heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)proprionate (SPDP) (Molecular Probes) in 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.5, at an SPDP:peptide molar ratio of 2:1. After reacting for 30 min, the SPDP-activated peptide was re-purified by reverse phase HPLC. Prior to attaching the activated peptide to the proteins, the cTnC monocysteine derivatives were reduced in 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 37°C for 1 h and desalted into 0.1 M NaHCO3 using Bio-Rad P6DG gel filtration resin. The reduced cTnC monocysteine proteins were then mixed with the SPDP-activated peptide in 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.5, at a peptide:protein molar ratio of 2:1. cTnC(C42), cTnC(C84), and cTnC(C85) were labeled in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2, whereas cTnC(C45) and cTnC(C81) were labeled in 1 mM EGTA. The absorbance of each labeling reaction was monitored at 343 nm, corresponding to the peak absorbance of the released chromophore, 2-pyridinethione. All cTnC-peptide conjugates were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon, Amicon Co.) and desalted into 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, using Bio-Rad P6DG gel filtration resin to remove unreacted reagents. Prior to biotinylation, the cTnC monocysteine derivatives were reduced overnight at 4°C in 1 mM Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (Molecular Probes). Proteins were biotinylated for 4 h at room temperature in a reaction mixture containing 0.5 mM biotin-maleimide (Molecular Probes, catalog number M-1602), 0.05 mM reduced protein, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.1 M NaCl. The reaction was quenched with 10 mM DTT and dialyzed against 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, to remove excess reagents. cTnC(A-Cys) was used as a negative control to demonstrate the extent of nonspecific labeling. The degree of labeling was determined by nondenaturing PAGE in the presence and absence of avidin. TnC-depleted cardiac and skeletal myofibrils were prepared and ATPase assays were performed as described previously(7.Dotson D.G. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24067-24073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, the peptide-TnC conjugates were incubated for 1 h at 42°C either with or without 8 mM DTT, prior to addition to the TnC-depleted myofibrils. The Ca2+ titration experiments were performed as described previously(7.Dotson D.G. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24067-24073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cTnC(C81) was labeled with the heterobifunctional photo-cross-linker benzophenone-4-maleimide (BP-Mal) as described previously for sTnC by Tao et al.(22.Tao T. Scheiner C.J. Lamkin M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7633-7639Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). First, cTnC(C81) was reduced with 10 mM DTT for 1 h at 37°C and dialyzed overnight against 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, and 0.1 mM DTT. BP-Mal was reacted with the reduced cTnC(C81) for 2 h at room temperature at a BP-Mal:protein molar ratio of 1.5-2.5:1. The reaction was quenched with excess DTT and dialyzed against 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0. The extent of labeling was estimated by monitoring the incorporation of BP-Mal at 265 nm ~1% = 23,000 M-1) and by assaying the unreacted sulfhydryl groups with dithionitrobenzoic acid. Binary cTnC-TnI complexes were prepared by mixing cTnC(C81)-BP and recombinant mouse cTnI (cTnI) at a molar ratio of 1:1.2 in 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 6 M urea. The ternary complex was prepared by mixing cTnC(C81)-BP, cTnI, and bovine cardiac troponin T (cTnT) at a molar ratio of 1:1.2:1.2 in the same buffer. These mixtures were dialyzed against 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 M KCl, 0.1 mM CaCl2 and then dialyzed against the same buffer with KCl concentrations decreasing stepwise (0.7 M to 0.5 M to 0.25 M to 0.1 M). After the final dialysis, the protein solutions were centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g to remove the free cTnI and cTnT. The complexes were photo-cross-linked in a Rayonet RMR-600 photochemical reactor at a wavelength of 350 nm for 1-30 min. The extent of cross-linking was visualized using SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1A lists the recombinant proteins used in the current study, and Fig. 1B shows the relative positions of sulfur atoms of the Cys residues in the monocysteine proteins. Cys-84 is one of the two endogenous Cys residues of cTnC. Residue 45, 81, and 85 are Met residues in the wild-type protein and are predicted to form part of the N-terminal hydrophobic surface of cTnC. Residues 45 and 81 are of particular interest, since our previous studies showed that the ϵC13 and ϵH1 chemical shifts of Met-45 and Met-81 change significantly upon Ca2+ binding to the low affinity site II(21.Lin X. Krudy G.A. Howarth J. Brito R.M.M. Rosevear P.R. Putkey J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14434-14442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Gly-42 was converted to Cys as a negative control, since it is predicted to be on the solvent accessible surface of helix B, based on the crystal structure of sTnC (23.Herzberg O. James M.N. Nature. 1985; 313: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) and a model of cTnC(24.Brito R.M.M. Putkey J.A. Strynadka N.C.J. James M.N.G. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10236-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A commercially available sulfhydryl-specific maleimide derivative of biotin was selected as one blocking group. Peptides were also considered as blocking groups, since they can be synthesized with specified lengths and chemical properties for desired solubility and coupling. Several criteria were considered in selection of the peptide sequence. Sufficient size was necessary to present an effective blocking group but not so large as to interact, either specifically or nonspecifically, with the C-terminal half of cTnC and thus interfere with binding to the thin filament. It is not necessary that the peptide have an intrinsic affinity for cTnC, but we felt that it should be designed based on available data for the interaction of peptides with either TnC or CaM rather than a more arbitrary sequence. Finally, the point of coupling should be near the middle of the peptide to prevent it from being displaced from its intended position by rotating about its end point. Given these criteria, we chose a peptide (Ac-Val-Arg-Ala-Ile-Gly-Lys-Leu-Ser-Ser) based on amino acids 807-815 from smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase which binds to the N-terminal half of CaM(25.Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 26.Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). The N-terminal Val was acetylated to provide a reactive amine on the Lys. Fig. 1B shows the relative size of the backbone of cTnC and the peptide. The peptide is depicted in an α-helix which would represent the minimal effective volume. A derivative of the minimal inhibitory peptide of cTnI or sTnI was not considered, since it preferentially associates with the C-terminal domain of intact sTnC and cTnC(27.Swenson C.A. Fredricksen R.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3420-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 28.Howarth J. Krudy G.A. Lin X. Putkey J.A. Rosevear P.R.

Shaw G.S. Campbell A.P. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1595-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Such an association might result in nonspecific coupling using certain chemistries due to localized high concentrations near the C-terminal domain. In contrast, our synthetic MLCK peptide does not appear to have significant affinity for cTnC, since it does not inhibit myofibril ATPase activity at a concentration of 0.1 mM and has no effect on the fluorescence signal from cTnC(C81) labeled with N-iodoacetyl-N′-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (data not shown). Fig. 2A shows the strategy used to cross-link the peptide to cTnC with the heterobifunctional cross-linker SPDP. The release of 2-pyridinethione was monitored spectrophotometrically to determine the extent of coupling. Fig. 2B shows that 10 mM DTT is required to completely reduce the disulfide bond between the peptide and cTnC(C81). Similar results were obtained with the other cTnC proteins. Thus, coupling of the peptide to the monocysteine proteins was essentially complete and cTnC-Pep adducts were stable but reversible. Biotin was coupled to cTnC by irreversible alkylation of Cys residues at pH 7.5. cTnC(A-Cys), which does not contain Cys residues, was used as a negative control, since maleimide can react with amines at a pH greater than 8.0. Native gels run in the presence or absence of avidin were used to determine the extent of coupling. Fig. 3 shows that about 90% of each monocysteine protein was biotinylated, while only a trace amount of cTnC(A-Cys) was biotinylated. Fig. 4A shows that all unmodified cTnC proteins recovered similar levels of Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity in cTnC-extracted cardiac myofibrils. Fig. 4B shows that the monocysteine derivatives exhibited greater variability in their ability to recover activity in sTnC-extracted fast skeletal myofibrils, but that all recovered at least 70% of the activity recovered by cTnC3. Table 1 compares the activities of the cross-linked proteins relative to the corresponding unmodified proteins. Covalent coupling of the peptide to Cys-81 resulted in 70-80% inhibition of cTnC activity in cardiac and skeletal myofibrils, respectively. The residual activity was not due to a significant amount of unmodified protein, since greater than 95% of cTnC(C81) was coupled to the peptide. The decreased Ca2+-dependent activity of cTnC(C81)-Pep results from a 10% increase in Ca2+-independent activity and a 60-70% decrease in total activity. Although residues 45, 84, and 85 are all predicted to form the N-terminal hydrophobic surface, coupling the peptide to these residues had resulted in little or no decrease in activity. Coupling the peptide to residue 42 resulted in a slight increase in activity.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The activities of cTnC-biotin adducts were determined using the skeletal myofibril ATPase assay. Table 2 shows the activities of the cTnC-biotin adducts in the presence and absence of Ca2+. The values are expressed as a percent of the maximal activity observed for the corresponding unmodified protein in the presence of Ca2+. The activity of cTnC(C45)-biotin in the presence of Ca2+ was not significantly different from the unmodified protein, but its Ca2+-independent activity was significantly increased. Biotinylation of cTnC(C84) and cTnC(C85) caused modest decreases in activity. This is consistent with the slight decrease in activity seen for cTnC(C84)-Pep and cTnC(C85)-Pep in Table 1. Similar to the results with the peptide conjugate, biotinylation greatly decreased the activity of cTnC(C81). These results confirm that the activity of cTnC is most affected by covalent modification of residue 81 in cTnC.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Preliminary experiments showed that binding avidin to cTnC(C42)-biotin had no effect on function, while avidin further decreased the activity of cTnC(C81)-biotin (data not shown). Additional experiments using avidin were not pursued, since labeling with biotin was not quantitative (see Fig. 3) and since the large size of avidin (60,000 Da) increases the possibility that observed functional consequences are due to disruption of interactive sites that are distal to the site of attachment. cTnC(C81)-Pep was selected for further characterization, since it has the most compromised activity. Fig. 5 shows that the Ca2+-dependent activity of cTnC(C81)-Pep remains virtually unchanged over a 5-fold range of concentrations in both cardiac and skeletal myofibril ATPase assays. Other experiments showed that cTnC(C81)-Pep effectively competed with cTnC(A-Cys) for binding sites on the thin filament (data not shown). Thus, coupling the peptide to position 81 does not greatly alter the affinity of cTnC(C81) for the thin filament. Conversion of nonpolar residues to polar residues in the N-terminal hydrophobic region of sTnC was shown to increase the Ca2+ affinity of the low affinity sites in the isolated sTnC (33.Pearlstone J.R. Borgford T. Chandra M. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Herzberg O. Moult J. Herklotz A. Reinach F.C. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6545-6553Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and to increase the pCa50 of skinned fiber contraction(34.Da Silva A.C.R. De Araujo A.H.B. Herzberg O. Moult J. Sorenson M. Reinach F.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to determine if covalent coupling of the peptide to cTnC(C81) affected the Ca2+ sensitivity of myofibril ATPase activity. Fast skeletal myofibrils were used for these experiments, since the specific activity of these preparations is about 10-fold greater than cardiac myofibrils. Fig. 6 shows that coupling the peptide to cTnC(C81) does not significantly alter the Ca2+ sensitivity of myofibril ATPase activity. If the compromised activity of cTnC(C81)-Pep is due to a blocking effect, then the region of Cys-81 should be in close proximity to other troponin subunits. To test this possibility, cTnC(C81) was labeled with the heterobifunctional photo-cross-linker BP-Mal, which has been used to study interactions between sTnC and sTnI(30.Leszyk J. Collins J.H. Leavis P.C. Tao T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7042-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31.Leszyk J. Collins J.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6983-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35.Leszyk J. Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Collins J.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36.Wang Z. Sarkar S. Gergely J. Tao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4953-4957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cTnC(A-Cys) was used as a control for cross-linking due to nonspecific modification of cTnC with BP-Mal. cTnC(C81)-BP or cTnC(A-Cys)-BP were cross-linked with either cTnI alone or with cTnI and cTnT. No significant cross-linking was observed using cTnC(A-Cys)-BP (data not shown). Fig. 7 shows that cTnC(C81)-BP effectively cross-links to cTnI when associated with the binary or ternary complex to form a dominant higher molecular weight product. Cross-linking to cTnT is less efficient and results in multiple bands which suggests multiple cross-linking sites. Cross-linking of cTnC(C81)-BP to cTnI is Ca2+ independent (Fig. 7, lanes 6, 7 and 9, 10), and the rates of cross-linking in the presence or absence of Ca2+ were indistinguishable (data not shown). It is difficult to interpret the significance of this observation with respect to Ca2+-dependent and -independent interactions between cTnC and cTnI. The cross-linker may not be able to differentiate between subtle but distinct apo and Ca2+-bound conformations, due to its the flexibility and length (about 9 Å). Also, conformational mobility of the cTnC-cTnI complex during the time frame of the cross-linking reaction may prevent identification of distinct Ca2+-bound and apo conformations. The side chain of Met-45 is predicted to reside on the inner surface of helix B in the N-terminal hydrophobic region (see Fig. 1), and NMR studies (21.Lin X. Krudy G.A. Howarth J. Brito R.M.M. Rosevear P.R. Putkey J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14434-14442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28.Howarth J. Krudy G.A. Lin X. Putkey J.A. Rosevear P.R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) indicate that the solvent accessibility of Met-45 increases upon binding Ca2+. Never the less, covalent modification of residue 45 had little or no functional consequence. We cannot exclude the possibility that blocking groups attached to cTnC(C45) can rotate about the covalent bond, perhaps under the influence of cTnI, and assume a position which does not interfere with transmission of the Ca2+ signal. If this occurs, it is likely that the bound peptide or biotin extends away from Met-81 (into the plane of the page in the model shown in Fig. 1). In any event, it is clear that localized structural alteration at residue 45 in the N-terminal hydrophobic region has little effect on the maximal activity of cTnC. Covalent modification of cTnC(C81) with either the peptide or biotin resulted in significant inhibition of activity. Modification of cTnC(C84) and cTnC(C85) lowered activity relative to the corresponding unmodified proteins, but inhibition was much less than that observed for cTnC(C81). These data can be interpreted with respect to the recent model for the Ca2+-bound binary complex of fast skeletal TnC and TnI proposed by Olah and Trewhella(37.Olah G.A. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12800-12806Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A primary feature of this model is that sTnI wraps around the central helix of sTnC and passes through the N- and C-terminal hydrophobic regions. Extensive interactions between sTnC and sTnI have been confirmed by a recent cross-linking study(38.Kobayashi T. Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Collins J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10946-10952Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). If this model also applies to cardiac TnC and TnI, then the region of Met-81 and secondarily Cys-84 and Met-85, which are predicted to be located on the same face of helix D as Met-81, may represent an interface between these two troponin subunits. Further experiments would be necessary to determine if this interaction is Ca2+-independent, as suggested by Fig. 7. The data presented here have important implications with respect to the mechanism of action of hydrophobic anti-CaM drugs, such as calmidazolium, bepridil, and phenothiazines, which sensitize muscle to Ca2+ and potentiate rather than inhibit muscle contraction(16.Solaro R.J.

Both studies concluded that these compounds establish hydrophobic interactions with residues in the N-terminal hydrophobic region of cTnC, including Met-81. Our data predict that strong interaction of a drug with Met-81 would inhibit rather than enhance the function of cTnC. This apparent inconsistency could be explained by an incorrect assignment for the methyl proton chemical shift for Met-81 of 2.22 ppm used in the previous studies. We have assigned this chemical shift to 1.35 ppm based on site-directed mutagenesis and two-dimensional heteronuclear single and multiple quantum coherence NMR(21.Lin X. Krudy G.A. Howarth J. Brito R.M.M. Rosevear P.R. Putkey J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14434-14442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although we feel that it is likely that bepridil and levosimendan bind to the N-terminal domain of free cTnC, they may make primary interactions with Met residues other than Met-81. If one assumes that the Ca2+-sensitizing effect of anti-CaM drugs results from association with the N-terminal hydrophobic region of thin filament-bound cTnC, then at least three mechanisms that can be considered. First, the drugs may associate with a critical hydrophobic cTnI binding site and sensitize cTnC to Ca2+, but then be displaced by cTnI when cTnC binds Ca2+. Second, the N-terminal hydrophobic region of cTnC may be a critical Ca2+-dependent site of interaction with cTnI, yet be able to simultaneously bind Ca2+-sensitizing drugs or the covalently bound peptide. Third, the N-terminal hydrophobic region may not be an essential Ca2+-dependent binding site for cTnI, but can bind drugs and sensitize cTnC to Ca2+. Our data are generally consistent with the latter two mechanisms, since they show that discrete regions on the N-terminal hydrophobic surface can tolerate covalently bound groups, and presumably a noncovalently bound drug, without interfering with transmission of the Ca2+ signal. This is also consistent with the study of Pearlstone et al.(33.Pearlstone J.R. Borgford T. Chandra M. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Herzberg O. Moult J. Herklotz A. Reinach F.C. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6545-6553Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) which showed that conversion of selected nonpolar residues to polar residues in the N-terminal hydrophobic region of sTnC increased the Ca2+ affinity of low affinity sites, but did not inhibit regulation. Thus, careful consideration must be given with respect to the precise role for the N-terminal hydrophobic region of cTnC in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction.

https://openalex.org/W2006538861,"A high-yield yeast expression system for site-directed mutagenesis of the Neurospora crassa plasma membrane H+-ATPase has recently been reported (Mahanty, S. K., Rao, U. S., Nicholas, R. A., and Scarborough, G. A.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 17705-17712). Using this system, each of the eight cysteine residues in the ATPase was changed to a serine or an alanine residue, producing strains C148S and C148A, C376S and C376A, C409S and C409A, C472S and C472A, C532S and C532A, C545S and C545A, C840S and C840A, and C869S and C869A, respectively. With the exception of C376S and C532S, all of the mutant ATPases are able to support the growth of yeast cells to different extents, indicating that they are functional. The C376S and C532S enzymes appear to be non-functional. After solubilization of the functional mutant ATPase molecules from isolated membranes with lysolecithin, all behaved similar to the native enzyme when subjected to glycerol density gradient centrifugation, indicating that they fold in a natural manner. The kinetic properties of these mutant enzymes were also similar to the native ATPase with the exception of C409A, which has a substantially higher Km. These results clearly indicate that none of the eight cysteine residues in the H+-ATPase molecule are essential for ATPase activity, but that Cys376, Cys409, and Cys532 may be in or near important sites. They also demonstrate that the previously described disulfide bridge between Cys148 and Cys840 or Cys869 plays no obvious role in the structure or function of this membrane transport enzyme. A high-yield yeast expression system for site-directed mutagenesis of the Neurospora crassa plasma membrane H+-ATPase has recently been reported (Mahanty, S. K., Rao, U. S., Nicholas, R.

They also demonstrate that the previously described disulfide bridge between Cys148 and Cys840 or Cys869 plays no obvious role in the structure or function of this membrane transport enzyme. The plasma membrane H+-ATPase of Neurospora crassa is an electrogenic (1.Scarborough G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) proton pump(2.Scarborough G.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2925-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), that belongs to the P-type family of ion translocating ATPases that form an aspartyl phosphate intermediate in their reaction cycle(3.Pedersen P.L.

This ATPase is closely related to the yeast and plant plasma membrane H+-ATPases and homologous with numerous mammalian cation translocating ATPases including the Na+/K+-, H+/K+-, and Ca2+-ATPases(5.Goffeau A.

The sulfhydryl reagent, N-ethylmaleimide was originally shown to have no effect on the H+-ATPase activity(10.Scarborough G.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but subsequent studies reported inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide when treatments were carried out at elevated pH values(11.Brooker R.J.

More recent studies of the effect of N-ethylmaleimide on the ATPase have been interpreted to indicate that Cys532 and Cys545 residues are near important sites(15.Pardo J.P. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9373-9379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Chang A. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15531-15536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but similar studies with methyl methanethiosulfonate have shown that neither of these cysteines nor cysteines at positions 376, 409, and 472 play a covalent role in the reaction cycle of the enzyme. In another study(17.Rao U.S. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7227-7235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the chemical states of the eight cysteine residues in the H+-ATPase molecule were determined, establishing the presence of a disulfide bridge between Cys148 and either Cys840 or Cys869. These studies provided valuable information as to the structure of the ATPase molecule but could not address the possible function of the disulfide bridge. Site-directed mutagenesis is a powerful tool for exploring structure-function relationships in the H+-ATPase by identifying individual amino acid residues that are important for its structure and activity. We have recently developed a yeast expression system for such studies of the Neurospora H+-ATPase(18.Mahanty S.K. Rao U.S. Nicholas R.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17705-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in this article, this system is used to further probe the roles of the eight cysteine residues in its structure and molecular mechanism. For mutagenesis, we began with the plasmid pSKMHA2(18.Mahanty S.K. Rao U.S. Nicholas R.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17705-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains the full-length N. crassa plasma membrane H+-ATPase cDNA. The NotI site at the 3′ end of the H+-ATPase cDNA in pSKMHA2 was removed by partially digesting with NotI, filling in the ends with DNA polymerase “Klenow” fragment, and religating with a SpeI linker (GACTAGTC), which resulted in plasmid pSKMHA9. pSKMHA9 was digested with either NotI and EcoRI, EcoRI and XbaI, XbaI and SmaI, SmaI and SacI, or SacI and SpeI, and each of the resulting ATPase cDNA cassettes was subcloned either into pBluescript or M13 mp18/19 vectors. Single stranded “U”-DNA was isolated from Escherichia coli CJ236 (dut-,ung-), and amino acid substitutions were made using the oligonucleotide-directed site-specific in vitro mutagenesis technique of Kunkel(19.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar). The mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed to singly substitute each Cys (TGC) codon with a Ser (AGC) or an Ala (GCC) codon or the active site Asp (GAC) codon to an Ala (GCC) codon. The mutated cassettes were completely sequenced to verify that only the planned changes had occurred. The cassettes were then ligated into the N. crassa H+-ATPase cDNA in place of the wild type cassette in pSKMHA9. In all cases, mutagenesis was confirmed again by sequencing the mutated region prior to yeast transformation. Quaprep plasmid spin kits (Quazen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) were routinely used for plasmid isolation from E. coli. Sequence analysis of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA was performed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (20.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar) using version 2.0 sequencing kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. E. coli strains MC1061 and HB101 were used for normal cloning, and strain JM83 was used for transformation with Bluescript plasmids. Strains JM103 and CJ236 were used for mutagenesis and for making single-stranded uracilated DNA templates, respectively. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain RS-72 was transformed with the different mutant constructs as described previously(18.Mahanty S.K. Rao U.S. Nicholas R.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17705-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transformations with Neurospora wild type H+-ATPase plasmid pSKMHA9 generated strain SKM9. The construction of strain SKM3 with the expression plasmid but no ATPase insert has been described(18.Mahanty S.K. Rao U.S. Nicholas R.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17705-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transformation with the plasmid containing the ATPase insert with the codon for Cys148 changed to an Ala codon generated strain C148A, and all other strains were similarly named. Yeast transformants were selected and propagated on galactose medium and then transferred to glucose medium in order to express only the mutant Neurospora ATPases(18.Mahanty S.K. Rao U.S. Nicholas R.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17705-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were maintained on agar plates at 4°C and were recultured every 2 weeks or kept at −80°C in 15% (w/v) glycerol for 6-8 months. The growth media and cell culture procedures for membrane isolation were essentially as described(18.Mahanty S.K. Rao U.S. Nicholas R.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17705-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All cultures used for membrane preparations were tested for revertants by plating roughly 106 cells on glucose medium and inspecting for large colonies after 24 h. Essentially no revertants were seen. Transformations of E. coli cells were routinely done using standard protocols(21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformation of the yeast cells was carried out according to the procedure of Ito et al. (22.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously(18.Mahanty S.K. Rao U.S. Nicholas R.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17705-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Drop tests for growth were carried out for the different mutants and control strains as described(18.Mahanty S.K. Rao U.S. Nicholas R.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17705-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ascertain the growth rates of the various strains in liquid glucose medium, the transformants were grown for 48 h in galactose medium (A610 nm approximately 3.0) at 30°C, and the cells were then transferred to glucose medium at a density of about 5 × 106 cells/ml, after which the growth was scored every 2-6 h as the A610 nm. Membranes from different yeast transformants were prepared essentially as described (18.Mahanty S.K. Rao U.S. Nicholas R.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17705-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that cell homogenization was carried out in a medium bead beater chamber and all of the solutions contained 2 μg/ml chymostatin. For membrane preparations from transformants that do not grow on glucose medium (strains C376S, C532S, and D378A), cells transferred from a master galactose plate were grown for 48 h at 30°C in 50 ml of galactose medium, diluted 1:10 in galactose medium, and grown for another 24 h, harvested aseptically, and transferred into an equal volume of double strength glucose medium (all components present in concentrations twice that previously described (18.Mahanty S.K. Rao U.S. Nicholas R.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17705-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and grown for an additional 24 h as above. In certain experiments the total membrane preparations were fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described by Villalba et al. (23.Villalba J.M. Palmgren M.G. Berberian G.E. Ferguson C. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12341-12349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solubilization of the membrane proteins with lysolecithin and purification of the various expressed H+-ATPase molecules by glycerol density gradient centrifugation were carried out as described (18.Mahanty S.K. Rao U.S. Nicholas R.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17705-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 12- ml 20-40% (w/v) linear glycerol gradients. The plasma membrane ATPase activity was measured as described(18.Mahanty S.K. Rao U.S. Nicholas R.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17705-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For kinetic studies of the H+-ATPase activity, equimolar concentrations of MgSO4:Na2ATP in the range of 0.25-14 mM were added and the assay mixture contained 2 mM of extra Mg2+ (as MgSO4) to compensate for the 2 mM EDTA present to complex traces of vanadate. For the vanadate sensitivity of the ATPase activities, a range of vanadate concentrations from 0.1 to 10 μM was added to the assay tubes and the EDTA was omitted. The specific activity, Km, and Vmax values were calculated by linear regression analyses of Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plots. The protein contents of the membranes and gradient fractions were determined by the Lowry procedure as modified by Bensadoun and Weinstein(24.Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviation used is: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. was performed essentially as described by Laemmli (25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar) with minor modifications(26.Addison R. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13165-13171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disaggregation of membrane suspensions or glycerol gradient fractions and electrophoresis of the samples was done as described (18.Mahanty S.K. Rao U.S. Nicholas R.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17705-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that only high resolution gels were used. Silver staining and immunoblotting were performed as described(18.Mahanty S.K. Rao U.S. Nicholas R.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17705-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For densitometric analysis of the amounts of mutant Neurospora ATPases present in the glycerol gradient fractions, aliquots of the pooled peak activity fractions (numbers 9, 10, 11, and 12 from the top) were first subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above, and the gels were silver-stained and photographed. The photographs were then scanned using a Bio-Rad Image Densitometer (Model GS-670) and the ATPase region was integrated using the Molecular Analyst TM/PC Software (Image Analysis Software Version 1.1.1). The amounts of the mutant ATPases were calculated by comparision with 5, 10, and 20 ng samples of purified native Neurospora H+-ATPase (27.Scarborough G.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) present in the same gel. SpeI linker (phosphorylated 10-mer) was obtained from New England Biolabs. Disodium ATP, lysolecithin, and chymostatin were from Sigma. The sources of all other reagents were as described(18.Mahanty S.K. Rao U.S. Nicholas R.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17705-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As described previously(18.Mahanty S.K. Rao U.S. Nicholas R.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17705-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the yeast expression system used for these studies, both the wild type yeast H+-ATPase and the plasmid-encoded Neurospora H+-ATPase are produced when the cells are grown in medium containing galactose as the carbon source. When the cells are transferred to glucose medium, synthesis of the yeast ATPase ceases, which limits growth to only a few doublings unless a functional Neurospora H+-ATPase is present. Fig. 1 shows these features with several control yeast strains used in this investigation. Growth of the parent strain SKM9 with an unmutated Neurospora H+-ATPase is shown along with the growth of strain SKM3, which contains the expression plasmid with no ATPase cDNA, and strain D378A, which contains a cDNA in which the codon for the active site Asp378 of the Neurospora enzyme has been changed to an Ala codon. The parent strain grows well, whereas both of the other control strains grow for only a few doublings and then stop growing as expected in glucose medium. Growth in glucose medium is thus a convenient screening assay for the functionality of the Neurospora H+-ATPase mutants we produce. Table 1 shows the growth rates of the control strains and the various cysteine mutant ATPase strains calculated from growth curves similar to those shown in Fig. 1. Both strain C148S and strain C148A grow at about the same rate as the unmutated ATPase control strain. Strain C376S does not grow any more than the negative control strains and strain 376A grows only very slowly. Strain C409S grows about the same as the unmutated ATPase strain, and significantly better than strain C409A. On the other hand, strain C472S grows substantially slower than strain C472A. Interestingly, strain C532S does not grow any more than the negative controls, whereas strain C532A grows well. Strains C545S and C840S both grow well whereas both strains C545A and C840A grow somewhat more slowly than their serine counterparts. Strain C869S grows at an intermediate rate whereas strain C869A grows at a rate about the same as that of the wild type strain SKM9.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To ascertain the amounts of the ATPase systhesized in the various strains, membranes were isolated from each of the mutants grown in glucose medium and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results indicated the presence of substantial amounts of the mutant ATPases in the membranes of all of the mutants except C376S, C532S, and D378A (data not shown). The levels of mutant Neurospora ATPase present in the membranes of these three strains were substantially lower, which precluded further analysis of these enzymes. When solubilized with the detergent, lysolecithin, the native Neurospora H+-ATPase is a hexamer (28.Chadwick C.C. Goormaghtigh E. Scarborough G.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that migrates to the bottom third of a 20-40% glycerol gradient(29.Smith R. Scarborough G.A. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This sedimentation behavior provides a simple but effective assay for proper folding of the recombinant Neurospora H+-ATPase molecules produced in yeast. To assess the extent to which the various cysteine mutants fold properly, each of the mutant ATPases was solubilized from the membranes with lysolecithin and the solubilized extract was subjected to glycerol density gradient centrifugation as described(18.Mahanty S.K. Rao U.S. Nicholas R.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17705-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results indicated that all Cys → Ala and the six remaining Cys → Ser mutant H+-ATPase molecules migrated quantitatively to a position identical to that of the SKM9 recombinant ATPase and the native enzyme (data not shown), providing strong evidence that each of these mutant ATPases folds correctly in theoretical yields. In addition to providing a simple folding assay, lysolecithin solubilization and glycerol density gradient centrifugation produces substantially purified preparations of the mutant ATPases useful for further analysis. Fig. 2 shows the H+-ATPase region of SDS-PAGE analyses of the pooled peak glycerol gradient fractions from two different membrane preparations from each of the various Cys → Ser and Cys → Ala mutants and the control strains SKM9 and SKM3. In the region between the 97.4 and 116.2 kDa standards, three bands are routinely seen. The uppermost of these bands is the yeast H+-ATPase, the middle one is the recombinant Neurospora H+-ATPase, and the lower one is an unidentified band of no interest in these studies. The yeast ATPase band represents residual amounts of this enzyme present when the cells are transferred to glucose medium. The analyses in Fig. 2 show that the amounts of the Neurospora ATPase synthesized are generally reproducible for each strain. To quantitate the amount of each mutant H+-ATPase present in the pooled peak glycerol gradient fractions, the gels of Fig. 2 were subjected to densitometric analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amounts of the mutant ATPases produced in the various strains are listed in Table 2. The amounts were variable from strain to strain in the range of roughly half to 1.6 times that of strain SKM9. The analyses also showed that none of the partially purified ATPase preparations contained more residual yeast H+-ATPase than that of the control strain SKM3, which contained only the yeast ATPase (Fig. 2, lanes 2).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab With this information, the kinetic characteristics of the various partially purified Cys → Ser and Cys → Ala mutant H+-ATPases could be determined. Importantly, the pooled gradient fractions from the control strain SKM3 showed no ATPase activity in the assay system used. Therefore, since none of the other preparations contained more yeast ATPase than strain SKM3, the ATPase activities measured reflect only that of the Neurospora enzymes. Table 2 shows the kinetic constants determined for the ATPases from all of the viable mutant and control strains. For all mutant ATPases analyzed, the Km and Vmax values are not substantially altered except in the case of mutant C409A, which shows a greater than 10-fold increase in its Km with no difference in Vmax. Although not shown, the vanadate sensitivities of all of the mutant enzymes were comparable to that in the wild type ATPase strain SKM9 (I50% about 1 μM). The results obtained in these studies allow several important conclusions regarding the functions of the eight cysteine residues in the Neurospora H+-ATPase molecule. First, it is clear that none of the cysteines is essential for the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. Replacement of each cysteine with an alanine residue produces functional ATPase molecules in strains C148A, C376A, C409A, C472A, C532A, C545A, C840A, and C869A, since all of these mutant ATPases are able to support the growth of yeast cells in glucose medium to some degree. Moreover, except for the C409A enzyme all of these mutant ATPases exhibit kinetic properties similar to that of the wild type strain SKM9. Second, although none of the cysteines is essential, several appear to be in or near important sites of action in the H+-ATPase molecule. Cys376 is clearly near the active site of the ATPase as it is only one residue removed from the active site aspartate at position 378, and the mutagenesis results reported here suggest that it may serve an important function. Although the C376A enzyme folds correctly and exhibits kinetic characteristics nearly the same as those of the wild type ATPase, it only weakly supports the growth of the cells. This suggests the possibility that the C376A ATPase may be uncoupled with respect to ATP hydrolysis and proton translocation. Alternatively, the rate of synthesis of this mutant ATPase may be somehow slowed. Obviously, a more detailed investigation of the C376A ATPase will be necessary before the defect in this interesting mutant will be understood. Cys409 is also important and appears to be a part of the MgATP binding site. Replacement of this cysteine with an alanine causes a 10-fold increase in the Km without alteration of the Vmax or vanadate sensitivity (Table 2). On the other hand, replacement of Cys409 with a serine does not change the Km near as drastically. This suggests that the -SH group of Cys409 may be involved in binding with some part of the substrate, MgATP, in the native enzyme. Cys532 may also be in or near an important site, since the mutant C532S ATPase totally failed to support growth on glucose medium (Table 1). However, mutant C532A supported cell growth and displayed normal kinetic characteristics. Cys532 has been reported to be protected against reaction with N-ethylmaleimide by MgADP and may thus be in or near the nucleotide binding site(15.Pardo J.P. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9373-9379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If so, our results suggest that some aspect of the substrate binding and phosphoryl transfer reactions occurs less efficiently when the cysteine -SH is replaced with an -OH by conversion to serine than when it is removed entirely by replacement with an alanine. The third conclusion that can be drawn from these experiments is that the previously detected disulfide bridge linking Cys148 and either Cys840 or Cys869(17.Rao U.S. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7227-7235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) plays no obvious role in the structure or function of the H+-ATPase molecule. Replacement of Cys148, Cys840, or Cys869 with a serine or an alanine residue does not affect the ability of the ATPase to support cell growth in any major way, and the folding and kinetic properties of these mutant ATPases are normal. These results preclude an important structural role for the disulfide bridge in the Neurospora H+-ATPase as made in yeast and assayed in these experiments. In our original description of the yeast expression system used in these studies, it was pointed out that in certain cases measuring the activities of expressed Neurospora H+-ATPase molecules in the presence of the endogenous yeast H+-ATPase may be problematic. However, from the studies reported here, it is clear that the yeast H+-ATPase is inactive in the ATPase assay procedure employed, because no ATPase activity could be detected in the appropriate glycerol gradient fractions produced with the plasmid control strain SKM3. Thus, contamination by the endogenous yeast H+-ATPase does not appear to be a problem for future mutagenesis studies of the Neurospora H+-ATPase using this expression system. However, as can be seen from our results with mutants C376S and C532S, a problem does remain for mutants that are totally unable to support cell growth. Whereas a negative growth test by a particular mutant is a strong indication that an important residue has been altered, the low amounts of the mutant ATPases produced makes further analysis of such interesting mutants more difficult than those that support growth. Encouragingly, preliminary results of membrane fractionation studies with mutants D378A, C376S, and C532S indicate that these ATPases are enriched in a light membrane fraction distinct from the plasma membrane. Thus, although more work will be required to study such ATPase mutants, detailed analyses of their activities and partial reactions should neverthless be possible. We thank Dr. Robert A. Nicholas for suggestions and encouragement throughout this work."

G., and Czech, M. P.(1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 947-954). We tested the possibility that the associated serine kinase activity was intrinsic to the receptor catalytic domain. The ratio of phosphoserine to phosphotyrosine on insulin receptors phosphorylated in vitro was used as an index of the associated serine kinase activity. Phosphorylation and phosphoamino acid analysis of insulin proreceptors revealed associated serine kinase activity early in receptor synthesis. Insulin receptors were expressed in HeLa cells using a recombinant vaccinia virus. The ratio of phosphoserine to phosphotyrosine on insulin receptors expressed by the recombinant vaccinia virus was determined relative to endogenous insulin receptors in cells treated with α-amanitin to block host cell mRNA synthesis. α-Amanitin treatment had no effect on the ratio of phosphoserine to phosphotyrosine on insulin receptors expressed from the recombinant virus even though they were present in a 4000-fold excess above endogenous receptors. We conclude that the serine kinase activity associated with the insulin receptor is intrinsic to the receptor catalytic domain. Receptor-catalyzed autophosphorylation of serine may play an important role in modulating insulin receptor signaling.
