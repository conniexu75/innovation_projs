https://openalex.org/W2124632458,"The gut microbiota influences both local and systemic inflammation. Inflammation contributes to development, progression, and treatment of cancer, but it remains unclear whether commensal bacteria affect inflammation in the sterile tumor microenvironment. Here, we show that disruption of the microbiota impairs the response of subcutaneous tumors to CpG-oligonucleotide immunotherapy and platinum chemotherapy. In antibiotics-treated or germ-free mice, tumor-infiltrating myeloid-derived cells responded poorly to therapy, resulting in lower cytokine production and tumor necrosis after CpG-oligonucleotide treatment and deficient production of reactive oxygen species and cytotoxicity after chemotherapy. Thus, optimal responses to cancer therapy require an intact commensal microbiota that mediates its effects by modulating myeloid-derived cell functions in the tumor microenvironment. These findings underscore the importance of the microbiota in the outcome of disease treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2059128083,"The Microbiota Makes for Good Therapy The gut microbiota has been implicated in the development of some cancers, such as colorectal cancer, but—given the important role our intestinal habitants play in metabolism—they may also modulate the efficacy of certain cancer therapeutics. Iida et al. (p. 967 ) evaluated the impact of the microbiota on the efficacy of an immunotherapy [CpG (the cytosine, guanosine, phosphodiester link) oligonucleotides] and oxaliplatin, a platinum compound used as a chemotherapeutic. Both therapies were reduced in efficacy in tumor-bearing mice that lacked microbiota, with the microbiota important for activating the innate immune response against the tumors. Viaud et al. (p. 971 ) found a similar effect of the microbiota on tumor-bearing mice treated with cyclophosphamide, but in this case it appeared that the microbiota promoted an adaptive immune response against the tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1530183786,"We report on results of an all-sky search for high-energy neutrino events interacting within the IceCube neutrino detector conducted between May 2010 and May 2012. The search follows up on the previous detection of two PeV neutrino events, with improved sensitivity and extended energy coverage down to approximately 30 TeV. Twenty-six additional events were observed, substantially more than expected from atmospheric backgrounds. Combined, both searches reject a purely atmospheric origin for the twenty-eight events at the $4\sigma$ level. These twenty-eight events, which include the highest energy neutrinos ever observed, have flavors, directions, and energies inconsistent with those expected from the atmospheric muon and neutrino backgrounds. These properties are, however, consistent with generic predictions for an additional component of extraterrestrial origin."
https://openalex.org/W2031843685,"The molecular basis of antigenic drift was determined for the hemagglutinin (HA) of human influenza A/H3N2 virus. From 1968 to 2003, antigenic change was caused mainly by single amino acid substitutions, which occurred at only seven positions in HA immediately adjacent to the receptor binding site. Most of these substitutions were involved in antigenic change more than once. Equivalent positions were responsible for the recent antigenic changes of influenza B and A/H1N1 viruses. Substitution of a single amino acid at one of these positions substantially changed the virus-specific antibody response in infected ferrets. These findings have potentially far-reaching consequences for understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that govern influenza viruses."

(p. 995 ; see the Perspective by Bozic and Nowak ) quantified the advantages of Apc -loss, Kras activation, and P53 mutation during tumor initiation in the mouse intestine. The mutations conferred only a limited clonal advantage. Indeed, many mutated stem cells were stochastically replaced by wild-type stem cells, helping to limit tumor initiation."

However, fluorinations often require the use of corrosive, hazardous reagents. Fier and Hartwig (p. 956 ) present an unusually mild and convenient protocol for fluorinating carbon sites adjacent to nitrogen in pyridines and related nitrogen-bearing arenes. The reaction entails treatment with silver difluoride and proceeds rapidly at room temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2044683692,"The observations of the exceptionally bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) 130427A by the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope provide constraints on the nature of such unique astrophysical sources. GRB 130427A had the largest fluence, highest-energy photon (95 GeV), longest $\gamma$-ray duration (20 hours), and one of the largest isotropic energy releases ever observed from a GRB. Temporal and spectral analyses of GRB 130427A challenge the widely accepted model that the non-thermal high-energy emission in the afterglow phase of GRBs is synchrotron emission radiated by electrons accelerated at an external shock."
https://openalex.org/W2026400708,"The NLRP3 inflammasome is a critical component of the innate immune system. NLRP3 activation is induced by diverse stimuli associated with bacterial infection or tissue damage, but its inappropriate activation is involved in the pathogenesis of inherited and acquired inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanism by which NLRP3 is activated remains poorly understood. In this study, we explored the role of kinases in NLRP3 inflammasome activation by screening a kinase inhibitor library and identified 3,4-methylenedioxy-β-nitrostyrene (MNS) as an inhibitor for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Notably, MNS did not affect the activation of the NLRC4 or AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) inflammasome. Mechanistically, MNS specifically prevented NLRP3-mediated ASC speck formation and oligomerization without blocking potassium efflux induced by NLRP3 agonists. Surprisingly, Syk kinase, the reported target of MNS, did not mediate the inhibitory activity of MNS on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We also found that the nitrovinyl group of MNS is essential for the inhibitory activity of MNS. Immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and mutation studies suggest that both the nucleotide binding oligomerization domain and the leucine-rich repeat domain of NLRP3 were the intracellular targets of MNS. Administration of MNS also inhibited NLRP3 ATPase activity in vitro, suggesting that MNS blocks the NLRP3 inflammasome by directly targeting NLRP3 or NLRP3-associated complexes. These studies identified a novel chemical probe for studying the molecular mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation which may advance the development of novel strategies to treat diseases associated with abnormal activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.

The innate immune system senses infection or injury through pattern recognition receptors and responds by inducing the production of proinflammatory and antimicrobial molecules. A major molecule produced upon pattern recognition receptor activation is IL-1β, a potent proinflammatory cytokine that contributes to host defense and the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases (1Dinarello C.A. Immunological and inflammatory functions of the interleukin-1 family.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (2493) Google Scholar). Consequently, IL-1β production is tightly regulated at both the translational and post-translational levels. IL-1β is synthesized by phagocytes as an inactive precursor and processed into biologically active IL-1β by the inflammasome, a large intracellular oligomeric protein complex (2Martinon F. Mayor A. Tschopp J. The inflammasomes: guardians of the body.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 229-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar). Inflammasome activation results in the recruitment and activation of caspase-1, which then cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature forms.

The NLRP3 inflammasome is particularly interesting among the inflammasomes because it responds to diverse stimuli, including bacteria, viruses, components released by dying cells, and particulate matter (4Schroder K. Tschopp J. The inflammasomes.Cell. 2010; 140: 821-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4115) Google Scholar).

Furthermore, genetic studies indicate that a spectrum of inflammatory disorders designated as cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndromes are caused by inherited NLRP3 mutations (12Ting J.P.

Antibodies against Syk, phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)-100), and GST were from Cell Signaling. Antibodies against actin and GAPDH were from Genescript. The InhibitorSelect 384-well protein kinase Library I, MNS, Bay 11-7082, and nigericin were purchased from Millipore. Anti-FLAG antibody, ATP, 3,4-(methylenedioxy)cinnamic acid, 1,2-methylenedioxy-4-propenylbenzene, trans-β-nitrostyrene, benzoylnitromethane, and trans-4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-β-nitrostyrene were from Sigma. Biotinyl-6-aminohexanoic acid (C16H27N3O4S) was purchased from Chem-Implex (Wood Dale, IL). Biotinylation of trans-4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-β-nitrostyrene with biotinyl-6-aminohexanoic acid was performed as described (18Giubellino A. Shi Z.D. Jenkins L.M. Worthy K.M. Bindu L.K. Athauda G.

Ultrapure LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 and poly(dA·dT)/lyovec were purchased from Invivogen. Salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium strain SL1344 was a gift from Denise Monack (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Streptavidin magnetic beads were from Pierce. Recombinant GST-NLRP3 was purchased from Abnova. Pi ColorLock Gold phosphate detection system was purchased from Innova Bioscience. All other reagents if not specified were from Sigma. Bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) were prepared and cultured as described previously (19Franchi L. Eigenbrod T. Núñez G. Cutting edge: TNF-α mediates sensitization to ATP and silica via the NLRP3 inflammasome in the absence of microbial stimulation.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 792-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). For screening with a kinase inhibitor library, 5 × 104 cells were plated on 96-well plates overnight. Cells were primed with 100 ng/ml LPS for 4 h in serum-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. Cells were incubated with each inhibitor (10 μm) for 15 min before being pulsed with 5 mm ATP for 30 min. The release of IL-1β in culture supernatants was determined by ELISA. For the detection of inflammasome activation by Western blotting, 1 × 106 cells were plated on 12-well plates overnight. Inhibitors were added to medium in the last 15 min of LPS priming. Inflammasome activation was induced by adding respective stimuli: 5 mm ATP (30 min), 10 μm nigericin (1 h), 500 μg/ml silica (4 h), 2 μg/ml poly(dA·dT) (4 h), and S. enterica sv. typhimurium (m.o.i. = 10, 1 h). Cells were lysed in ice-cold PBS buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The proteins from cell-free supernatants were precipitated by choloform/methanol method. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes by electroblotting (Bio-Rad), and membranes were immunoblotted with respective antibodies. Mouse IL-1β and TNF-α in culture supernatants were measured by ELISA kits (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer's manual. Mouse IL-18 in culture supernatants was measured with an ELISA kit from eBioscience. Assays were performed in triplicate for each independent experiment. Fetal livers were harvested at day 16 of gestation from both WT and syk−/− embryos generated by intercrossing syk+/− transgenic mice (S129). 5 × 106 cells were injected into the lateral tail vein of 8-week-old recipients that had been lethally irradiated with two doses of 550 rads of x-irradiation separated by 3 h. The recipient animals received antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) for 8 weeks after reconstitution. Bone marrows were harvested from chimeras and differentiated for macrophages as described above. Intracellular K+ measurements were performed as described previously (20Muñoz-Planillo R. Kuffa P. Martínez-Colón G. Smith B.L. Rajendiran T.M. Núñez G. K+ efflux is the common trigger of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by bacterial toxins and particulate matter.Immunity. 2013; 38: 1142-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Briefly, macrophages were plated on 96-well plates. Culture medium was thoroughly aspirated after stimulation. Cells were lysed with 3% ultrapure HNO3. Intracellular K+ was then determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry with an Optima 2000 DV spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using yttrium as internal standard. BMDMs were plated on an 8-well chamber slide overnight. Cells were primed and pretreated with inhibitor or DMSO before being stimulated with ATP or nigericin, transfected with poly(dA·dT), or infected with S. enterica sv. typhimurium. After stimulation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with PBS buffer containing 3% BSA. Cells were stained with anti-Asc antibody and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody. DAPI was used to stain nuclei. Cell images were taken with Zeiss fluorescent microscope. For ASC oligomer cross-linking, cells were lysed with PBS buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and the cell lysates were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The Triton X-100-insoluble pellets were washed with PBS twice and then suspended in 200 μl of PBS. The pellets were then cross-linked at room temperature for 30 min by adding disuccinimidyl suberate (2 mm). The cross-linked pellets were spun down at 8000 rpm for 15 min and dissolved directly in SDS sample buffer. 2.5 × 106 HEK293T cells were plated on a 100-mm Petri dish a day before transfection. Cells were transfected for 16 h with triple FLAG-tagged full-length NLRP3 (FL, 1.25 μg), pyrin deletion mutant ΔPyrin (amino acids 94–1036, 1.25 μg), LRR deletion mutant ΔLRR (amino acids 1–741, 2.5 μg), pyrin domain (amino acids 1–93, 1.25 μg), NOD domain (amino acids 220–536, 5 μg), and LRR domain (amino acids 742–991, 2.5 μg) by Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen). Cell culture medium was replaced with prewarmed serum-free DMEM. Cells were incubated with biotinylated compound biotin-trans-4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-β-nitrostyrene (biotin-HMNS) (10 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C and then lysed in 1.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1× EDTA-free proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (14,000 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min. Cell lysates were incubated with streptavidin magnetic beads (25-μl slurry) overnight. The proteins bound by biotin-HMNS were pulled down and subjected to Western blotting. LPS primed BMDMs were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1×Roche EDTA-free proteinase inhibitor mixture). 1 ml of cell lysates with total 1 mg protein were incubated with biotin (1 μm) or biotin-HMNS (1 μm) at 4 °C for 1 h. 50 μl of streptavidin magnetic beads (slurry) was added to cell lysates, followed by further incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. Magnetic beads were pulled down with a magnetic stand and washed with lysis buffer four times. Bound proteins were dissolved in SDS sample buffer. Proteins pulled down by biotin-HMNS were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to mass spectrometry with whole lane analysis. When cells were used for the binding assay, cells were pretreated with biotin-HMNS (10 μm) for 30 min before lysis. For binding assay of GST-NLRP3 by biotin-HMNS, glutathione was removed from the solution of recombinant GST-NLRP3 with Slide-A-Lyzer Mini Dialysis Devices (Pierce) before incubation. For competition binding assay, 5 × 106 LPS-primed BMDMs were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer. Cell lysates were pretreated with 100 μm Bay 11-7082 or l-cysteine for 30 min at 4 °C before adding 1 μm biotin-HMNS. Recombinant NLRP3 was incubated with the indicated concentrations of MNS inhibitor in reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 1× proteinase inhibitor) for 15 min. DMSO was used as a vehicle control. The reaction mixtures were further incubated for 1 h at 37 °C after the addition of 250 μm ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP by NLRP3 was measured by Pi ColorLock Gold phosphate detection system according to the manual. The percentage of cell death was determined using the lactate dehydrogenase release assay (Promega). The absorbance at 490 nm was measured, and the percentage of cytotoxicity was calculated relative to the 100% release value obtained by lysis of cells with a solution of 0.1% Triton X-100. Student's t test was used to determine statistically significant difference between two groups. One-way analysis of variance was used to analyze differences among multiple groups. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Given the universal role of kinases in signal transduction, we sought to investigate the signaling mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by screening a kinase inhibitory library containing 160 selected kinase inhibitors. As Toll-like receptor ligands or cytokines are required to induce the expression of Nlrp3 and pro-IL-1β through NF-κB signaling in mouse bone marrow macrophages (21Bauernfeind F.G. Horvath G. Stutz A. Alnemri E.S. MacDonald K. Speert D. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Monks B.G. Fitzgerald K.A. Hornung V. Latz E. Cutting edge: NF-κB activating pattern recognition and cytokine receptors license NLRP3 inflammasome activation by regulating NLRP3 expression.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 787-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar), we primed macrophages with LPS before the treatment with inhibitors to exclude their potential inhibitory effects on the NF-κB signaling pathway. Macrophages were treated with each kinase inhibitor (10 μm) for 15 min before stimulation with the NLRP3 activator ATP. We used ELISA to measure the level of IL-1β in the culture supernatant as a readout for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The compound Bay 11-7082 inhibited Nlrp3 inflammasome activation in accordance with a previous report (22Juliana C. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Datta P. Solorzano L. Yu J.W. Meng R. Quong A.A. Latz E. Scott C.P. Alnemri E.S. Anti-inflammatory compounds parthenolide and Bay 11-7082 are direct inhibitors of the inflammasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9792-9802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). We identified an additional chemical compound, MNS, that consistently abolished IL-1β secretion in our screening experiments (Fig. 1A). To further investigate the inhibitory activity of MNS, we examined ATP-induced IL-1β secretion by LPS-primed mouse macrophages in the presence of different concentrations of the compound. As shown in Fig. 1B, MNS inhibited IL-1β secretion with an approximate IC50 of 2 μm. In contrast, the levels of TNF-α secretion between untreated and MNS-treated macrophages were comparable (Fig. 1C). Consistent with the ELISA results, MNS inhibited the production of mature IL-1β in the cell supernatant as shown by immunoblotting (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, IL-18 secretion and caspase-1 cleavage were also inhibited in the presence of MNS. Notably, MNS did not affect the protein levels of Nlrp3, Asc, or caspase-1 in mouse macrophages (Fig. 1D). As a comparison, MNS was slightly more potent than Bay 11-7082 in inhibiting NLRP3-mediated caspase-1 cleavage (Fig. 1E). In addition, treatment with MNS also inhibited ATP-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in Nlrp3-null immortalized macrophages reconstituted with Nlrp3, which do not need priming for Nlrp3 induction (Fig. 1F). These results indicate that chemical compound MNS potently inhibits ATP-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. ATP activates the NLRP3 inflammasome through P2X7 receptor signaling (23Franchi L. Kanneganti T.D. Dubyak G.R. Núñez G. Differential requirement of P2X7 receptor and intracellular K+ for caspase-1 activation induced by intracellular and extracellular bacteria.J. Biol.

Mechanisms of caspase-1 activation by P2X7 receptor-mediated K+ release.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 286: C1100-C1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To determine whether MNS specifically targets P2X7 receptor signaling or a common signaling component(s) for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, we tested the inhibitory activity of MNS on inflammasome activation induced by two additional NLRP3 activators, nigericin and silica, which act independently of the P2X7 receptor. As it was observed with ATP, treatment with MNS inhibited IL-1β secretion induced by both NLRP3 activators in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). Consistent with reduced secretion of IL-1β, immunoblotting of culture supernatant revealed that the cleavage of caspase-1 was abolished in the presence of MNS (Fig. 2C). In contrast, MNS treatment did not affect caspase-1 activation induced by Salmonella, a pathogen known to trigger NLRC4 inflammasome activation (Fig. 2D) (25Miao E.A. Alpuche-Aranda C.M. Dors M.

AIM2 recognizes cytosolic dsDNA and forms a caspase-1-activating inflammasome with ASC.Nature. 2009; 458: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). Likewise, MNS did not affect AIM2 inflammasome activation by poly(dA·dT) (Fig. 2E). Caspase-1 activation triggers pyropotosis in macrophages, which can be revealed by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase (29Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Yu J.W. Datta P. Miller B. Jankowski W. Rosenberg S. Zhang J. Alnemri E.S. The pyroptosome: a supramolecular assembly of ASC dimers mediating inflammatory cell death via caspase-1 activation.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1590-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Consistently, MNS prevented ATP- and nigericin-induced lactate dehydrogenase release, but not that induced by Salmonella and poly(dA·dT) (Fig. 2F). These data indicate that MNS is a specific inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome. MNS is categorized as a Syk kinase inhibitor in our screening kinase inhibitor library. A previous study has shown that Syk was not required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation by nigericin but was essential for Candida albicans-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in dendritic cells (30Gross O. Poeck H. Bscheider M. Dostert C. Hannesschläger N. Endres S. Hartmann G. Tardivel A. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V. Mocsai A. Tschopp J. Ruland J. Syk kinase signalling couples to the Nlrp3 inflammasome for anti-fungal host defence.Nature. 2009; 459: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). To examine further the role of Syk in NLRP3 inflammasome activation, we generated Syk-deficient BMDMs from chimeric mice. Syk depletion was confirmed in Syk−/− BMDMs by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). There was minimal or no impairment in caspase-1 cleavage in response to the NLRP3 activators ATP, nigericin and silica in Syk−/− macrophages compared with wild-type macrophages (Fig. 3B). However, IL-1β secretion was reduced in Syk−/− macrophages, consistent with the reduced levels of pro-IL-1β in Syk−/− macrophages (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, IL-18 secretion was slightly elevated in Syk−/− macrophages as well as the intracellular levels of pro-IL-18 (Fig. 3B). This elevated secretion of IL-18 in Syk−/− macrophages was also confirmed by ELISA (Fig. 3D). The secretion of cytokine TNF-α was not affected by Syk deficiency (Fig. 3E). These data suggest that the Syk kinase contributes to pro-IL-1β induction by LPS but is largely dispensable for MNS-mediated inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Potassium efflux is required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to ATP, bacterial toxins, and particulate matter (20Muñoz-Planillo R. Kuffa P. Martínez-Colón G. Smith B.L. Rajendiran T.M.

Dostert C. Mayor A. Martinon F. Tschopp J. Activation of the NALP3 inflammasome is triggered by low intracellular potassium concentration.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). To test whether MNS inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation by preventing potassium efflux, we compared the levels of intracellular potassium after ATP stimulation in the presence or absence of MNS. ATP stimulation induced the drop of intracellular potassium in DMSO-treated macrophages, and this was unaffected by MNS pretreatment, suggesting that MNS acts downstream of potassium efflux to inhibit NLRP3 activation (Fig. 4A). A common event associated with inflammasome activation is the formation of large intracellular ASC aggregates called ASC specks that can be observed by microscopy or detected as oligomers after chemical cross-linking by immunoblotting (29Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Yu J.W. Datta P. Miller B. Jankowski W. Rosenberg S. Zhang J. Alnemri E.S. The pyroptosome: a supramolecular assembly of ASC dimers mediating inflammatory cell death via caspase-1 activation.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1590-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). MNS prevented ASC speck formation induced by NLRP3 agonists, but did not affect ASC speck formation induced by stimuli that activate NLRC4 or AIM2 (Fig. 4, B and C). Biochemically, the presence of MNS abolished ASC oligomerization induced by activation of NLRP3, but not of the NLRC4 inflammasome (Fig. 4D). In contrast, YVAD, an inhibitor of caspase-1, blocked caspase-1 cleavage but did not affect ASC oligomerization (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that MNS specifically inhibits NLRP3-mediated ASC speckle formation. To explore the structure-activity relationship of MNS and the NLRP3 inflammasome, we examined the inhibitory activity of MNS analogues on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We selected five analogues for our experiments: 3,4-(methylenedioxy)cinnamic acid (C1), 1,2-methylenedioxy-4-propenylbenzene (C2), trans-β-nitrostyrene (C3), benzoylnitromethane (C4), and trans-4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-β-nitrostyrene (C5), which have modifications on the nitrovinyl group or dioxole group (Fig. 5A). LPS-primed macrophages were pretreated with different doses of MNS analogues before ATP stimulation. MNS analogues lacking the nitrovinyl side chain (3,4-(methylenedioxy)cinnamic acid, 1,2-methylenedioxy-4-propenylbenzene, and benzoylnitromethane) did not inhibit NLRP3-mediated caspase-1 cleavage and IL-1β secretion. In contrast, trans-β-nitrostyrene and trans-4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-β-nitrostyrene retained inhibitory activity (Fig. 5, B and C). These results suggest that the nitrovinyl side chain is essential for MNS-mediated inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. As MNS was previously reported to inhibit tyrosine kinases (32Wang W.Y. Hsieh P.W. Wu Y.C. Wu C.C. Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of novel β-nitrostyrene derivatives as tyrosine kinase inhibitors with potent antiplatelet activity.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 74: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we examined the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation in BMDMs stimulated by ATP or nigericin in the absence or presence of inhibitors. Cells treated with MNS and C4 had comparable patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation as detected by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr antibody (data not shown). To determine the mechanism by which MNS inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation, we examined MNS-targeted proteins in mouse macrophages. The compound HMNS was biotinylated through hydrogen oxide group (biotin-HMNS) (Fig. 6A). Biotin-HMNS retained inhibitory activity on NLRP3 inflammasome, albeit at a higher concentration (Fig. 6B). Macrophage proteins pulled down by biotin-HMNS were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 6C and supplemental Table). Notably, NLRP3 protein was one of the most abundant proteins pulled down by biotin-HMNS. The association between biotin-HMNS and NLRP3 protein was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting (Fig. 6D). Consistent with the finding that MNS does not inhibit NLRC4 inflammasome, we could not detect biotin-HMNS associated with the NLRC4 protein by mass spectrometry or immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 6D and supplemental Table). Furthermore, biotin-HMNS could pull down recombinant NLRP3, and this was abolished in the presence of excess HMNS (Fig. 6E). These data suggest that NLRP3 is directly targeted by MNS. To map the targeting domains of NLRP3 by MNS, we treated HEK293 cells expressing full-length wild-type NLRP3 (FL) or mutants lacking the pyrin domain (ΔPyrin) or the leucine-rich repeat domain (ΔLRR) with biotin-HMNS. Biotin-HMNS could pull down WT NLRP3 and NLRP3 mutants with deletion of either the pyrin or LRR domain (Fig. 6F). Moreover, biotin-HMNS could pull down the NOD and the LRR domain, but not the pyrin domain (Fig. 6G). Furthermore, MNS inhibited the ATPase activity of NLRP3 in a concentration-dependent manner, as measured by the release of free phosphate (Fig. 6H). Bay 11-7082 has been reported to inhibit the ATPase activity of NLRP3 possibly through the mechanism of cysteine modification (22Juliana C. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Datta P. Solorzano L. Yu J.W. Meng R. Quong A.A. Latz E. Scott C.P. Alnemri E.S. Anti-inflammatory compounds parthenolide and Bay 11-7082 are direct inhibitors of the inflammasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9792-9802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). We examined whether Bay 11-7082 and l-cysteine could compete off the pulldown of NLRP3 by biotin-HMNS. Addition of excess amounts of Bay 11-7082 and l-cysteine abolished the pulldown of NLRP3 by biotin-HMNS (Fig. 6I). Taken together, these results suggest that MNS directly binds to NLRP3 and inhibit its ATPase activity. Inappropriate activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammation-associated diseases, such as gouty arthritis, silicosis, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndromes (2Martinon F. Mayor A. Tschopp J. The inflammasomes: guardians of the body.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 229-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar, 33Davis B.K. Wen H. Ting J.P. The inflammasome NLRs in immunity, inflammation, and associated diseases.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 29: 707-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation could have therapeutic potential for treating these diverse inflammatory diseases. Based on research in mouse macrophages, a two-step mechanism has been proposed for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In the first step, known as priming, NLRP3 is transcriptionally up-regulated by TLR ligands or cytokines through the NF-κB signaling pathway (21Bauernfeind F.G. Horvath G. Stutz A. Alnemri E.S. MacDonald K. Speert D. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Monks B.G. Fitzgerald K.A. Hornung V. Latz E. Cutting edge: NF-κB activating pattern recognition and cytokine receptors license NLRP3 inflammasome activation by regulating NLRP3 expression.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 787-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar). However, NLRP3 induction is not sufficient for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in that a second step triggered by diverse stimuli such as ATP, nigericin, or particulate matter, is necessary for NLRP3 activation (7Martinon F. Pétrilli V. Mayor A. Tardivel A. Tschopp J. Gout-associated uric acid crystals activate the NALP3 inflammasome.Nature. 2006; 440: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (3760) Google Scholar, 34Mariathasan S. Weiss D.S. Newton K. McBride J. O'Rourke K. Roose-Girma M. Lee W.P. Weinrauch Y. Monack D.M. Dixit V.M. Cryopyrin activates the inflammasome in response to toxins and ATP.Nature. 2006; 440: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar). Although kinases such as IκK and TAK1 are required for the priming step of NLRP3 induction, it is not clear whether kinases are also involved in the activating step. A previous study showed that the kinase PKR was required for the activation of all known inflammasomes including the NLRP3 inflammasome (35Lu B. Nakamura T. Inouye K. Li J. Tang Y. Lundbäck P. Valdes-Ferrer S.I. Olofsson P.S. Kalb T. Roth J. Zou Y. Erlandsson-Harris H. Yang H. Ting J.P. Wang H. Andersson U. Antoine D.J. Chavan S.S. Hotamisligil G.S. Tracey K.J. Novel role of PKR in inflammasome activation and HMGB1 release.Nature. 2012; 488: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). However, these results could not be confirmed by a different study (36He Y. Franchi L. Núñez G. The protein kinase PKR is critical for LPS-induced iNOS production but dispensable for inflammasome activation in macrophages.Eur. J. Immunol. 2013; 43: 1147-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKCδ was reported to regulate NLRC4 inflammasome activation by phosphorylating NLRC4 (37Qu Y. Misaghi S. Izrael-Tomasevic A. Newton K. Gilmour L.L. Lamkanfi M. Louie S. Kayagaki N. Liu J. Kömüves L. Cupp J.E. Arnott D. Monack D. Dixit V.M. Phosphorylation of NLRC4 is critical for inflammasome activation.Nature. 2012; 490: 539-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to explore the role of kinases in NLRP3 inflammasome activation by screening a kinase inhibitor library. We identified a Syk kinase inhibitor, MNS, as an inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. MNS did not affect the activation of the NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes at concentrations that abrogated NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Surprisingly, deletion of the Syk kinase in macrophages did not affect NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by ATP, nigericin and silica, indicating that Syk is dispensable for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These results are consistent with a previous study that Syk was required for caspase-1 activation induced by the fungus C. albicans but was not necessary for nigericin-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in dendritic cells (30Gross O. Poeck H. Bscheider M. Dostert C. Hannesschläger N. Endres S. Hartmann G. Tardivel A. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V. Mocsai A. Tschopp J. Ruland J. Syk kinase signalling couples to the Nlrp3 inflammasome for anti-fungal host defence.Nature. 2009; 459: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). MNS was reported to inhibit other tyrosine kinases such as Src and FAK at higher concentrations (IC50 > 27.3 μm) (32Wang W.Y. Hsieh P.W. Wu Y.C. Wu C.C. Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of novel β-nitrostyrene derivatives as tyrosine kinase inhibitors with potent antiplatelet activity.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 74: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that those tyrosine kinase(s) may play a redundant role in NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. However, we found that MNS treatment had patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation comparable with those of C4 treatment after ATP or nigericin stimulation. Alternatively, MNS may inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation through a novel kinase-independent fashion (see below). Further studies are needed to understand how MNS inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome."

In contrast, its metabolic precursor ceramide is prodifferentiative and proapoptotic. To determine whether sphingolipid balance plays a significant role in glioma malignancy, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of sphingolipid metabolites in human glioma and normal gray matter tissue specimens. We demonstrate, for the first time, a systematic shift in sphingolipid metabolism favoring S1P over ceramide, which increases with increasing cancer grade. S1P content was, on average, 9-fold higher in glioblastoma tissues compared with normal gray matter, whereas the most abundant form of ceramide in the brain, C18 ceramide, was on average 5-fold lower. Increased S1P content in the tumors was significantly correlated with increased sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) and decreased sphingosine phosphate phosphatase 2 (SGPP2) expression. Inhibition of S1P production by cultured glioblastoma cells, using a highly potent and selective SPHK1 inhibitor, blocked angiogenesis in cocultured endothelial cells without affecting VEGF secretion. Our findings validate the hypothesis that an altered ceramide/S1P balance is an important feature of human cancers and support the development of SPHK1 inhibitors as antiangiogenic agents for cancer therapy."

We attribute this correlation to co-generation in an external shock. The simultaneous, multi-color, optical observations are best explained at early times by reverse shock emission generated in the relativistic burst ejecta as it collides with surrounding material and at late times by a forward shock traversing the circumburst environment.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 5The abbreviations used are:TLRToll-like receptorRMSDroot mean square deviationMALSmultiangle light scatteringTIRToll/interleukin-1 receptorSAXSsmall angle x-ray scattering. are a family of pattern recognition receptors that sense danger in the forms of both conserved microbial molecules and host-derived factors that are present when homeostasis is dysregulated (1Kawai T. Akira S. The role of pattern-recognition receptors in innate immunity. Update on Toll-like receptors.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). The Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain is a key molecular component of TLR-mediated innate immune response pathways. All mammalian TLRs and several cytosolic adaptor proteins contain TIR domains in their C-terminal regions (2Ve T. Gay N.J. Mansell A. Kobe B. Kellie S. Adaptors in Toll-like receptor signaling and their potential as therapeutic targets.Curr. Drug Targets. 2012; 13: 1360-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Homo- or heterotypic dimerization of receptor TIR domains is required to initiate downstream signaling via the recruitment of TIR domain-containing adaptor proteins such as MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88), TRIF (TIR domain-containing adaptor protein inducing INF-β), MAL (MyD88 adaptor-like protein), and TRAM (TRIF-related adaptor molecule) (2Ve T.

The data reported so far do not agree on the mechanism by which TcpB interacts with mammalian TIR domain-containing proteins (6Rana R.R. Zhang M. Spear A.M. Atkins H.S. Byrne B. Bacterial TIR-containing proteins and host innate immune system evasion.Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 2013; 202: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).

Drug Targets. 2012; 13: 1360-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), all previous TcpB interaction studies used full-length TcpB. Furthermore, the interaction of TcpB with MyD88 was suggested to be independent of the MyD88 TIR domain (12Chaudhary A. Ganguly K. Cabantous S. Waldo G.S. Micheva-Viteva S.N. Nag K. Hlavacek W.S.

However, mutational studies have validated a number of proposed interfaces, often involving different loop regions (2Ve T. Gay N.J. Mansell A. Kobe B. Kellie S. Adaptors in Toll-like receptor signaling and their potential as therapeutic targets.Curr. Drug Targets. 2012; 13: 1360-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).

To elucidate the molecular basis of function of the microbial TIR domain-containing proteins, we used the B. melitensis TcpB protein as a model to study the interaction between the bacterial and mammalian TIR domain-containing proteins. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays, we show that TcpB can interact with MAL, MyD88, and TLR4, with the interaction interface for both MAL and TLR4 involving the TcpB BB loop. TcpB does not interact with TRAM or IRAK-2, suggesting that TcpB specifically targets the MAL-dependent signaling pathway. Furthermore, competition assays demonstrate that TcpB disrupts the receptor-adaptor interaction between TLR4 and MAL, but not the adaptor-adaptor interaction between MAL and MyD88. We also show that TcpB exists as a stable dimer in solution and that both the TIR and N-terminal domains are involved in self-association. Structural and functional analysis of the TcpB TIR domain reveals a homotypic interface that is required for potent NF-κB suppression mediated by TcpB. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of bacterial TIR domain-containing protein immunomodulation of TLR signaling at the molecular and structural level. For recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli, the cDNA of the full-length TcpB (TcpB-fl) was generated by PCR-based gene synthesis and used for cloning TcpB-fl, the TcpB-TIR domain (TcpB120–250), a longer construct containing the TcpB-TIR domain (TcpB70–250) and the TcpB N-terminal domain (TcpB1–119) sequences into the pMCSG7 vector (23Eschenfeldt W.H.

Biol. 2009; 498: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and subsequent transformation into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. The TcpB residue numbering used in the paper corresponds to the UniProt accession number Q8YF53. For protein expression in mammalian cells, a plasmid encoding the cDNA of TcpB-fl (obtained from Thomas Miethke, Technical University, Munich, Germany (11Cirl C. Wieser A. Yadav M. Duerr S.

Med. 2008; 14: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar)) was used to clone TcpB and its mutants into the pEF6/V5 vector (Invitrogen), to be subsequently used in luciferase NF-κB reporter assays and co-immunoprecipitation studies. HA-MyD88, HA-MAL, HA-TLR4, FLAG-MAL, FLAG-TRAM, Myc-IRAK-2, NF-κB reporter gene, and phRL-TK reporter gene were obtained from Andrew Bowie (Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland). HEK293 cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well plates, 24 h before transfection with Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were harvested after 24 h using 350 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate). To test the interaction of TcpB and TcpBG158A with MAL, MyD88, TLR4, TRAM, and IRAK-2, 1 μg of full-length V5-TcpB or V5-TcpBG158A was co-transfected with 1 μg of HA-MAL, HA-MyD88, HA-TLR4, FLAG-TRAM, Myc-IRAK-2, or HA-tagged control protein (all correspond to full-length proteins). 50 μl of lysate was retained for analysis of protein expression. The remainder was incubated with 2 μl of anti-V5 for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. 25 μl of prewashed (washing buffer: 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl) Dynabeads® protein G (Invitrogen) magnetic beads were added to the lysate and further incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The lysates were then washed three times with high salt concentration buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl). To test the interference of TcpB with receptor-adaptor or adaptor-adaptor interactions, 1 μg of FLAG-MAL or FLAG-TRAM was co-transfected with 1 μg of HA-MyD88 or HA-TLR4. The lysate was incubated with 2 μl of anti-FLAG-M2 for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. 25 μl of prewashed (washing buffer: 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl) Dynabeads® protein G (Invitrogen) magnetic beads were added to the lysate and further incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. Increasing amounts (1, 10, and 100 μg) of recombinant TcpB-fl, TcpB120–250, TcpB1–119, or GST proteins were added to the lysate and further incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with rotation. The lysates were then washed three times with high salt concentration buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting. To compare the NF-κB suppression activity of wild-type versus mutant full-length TcpB, HEK293-TLR4-MD2 cells were seeded into 24-well plates (8 × 104 cells/well). 24 h later, cells were co-transfected with 100 ng of NF-κB-luciferase reporter gene, 20 ng/well of phRL-TK reporter gene, and 200 ng of TcpB or TcpB mutants using Lipofectamine 2000. The total amount of DNA per transfection was kept constant at 460 ng by the addition of pGL-2B empty vector. After 24 h, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS. After a further 8 h, cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega), and whole cell lysates were analyzed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity, and data are expressed as relative luciferase activity and are representative of three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. Statistical analysis was carried out in GraphPad Prism version 6 (San Diego, CA) using two-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test. The TcpB120–250 protein was expressed using auto-induction media (24Studier F.W. Protein production by auto-induction in high-density shaking cultures.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4107) Google Scholar) and purified using nickel affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography. Peak fractions were pooled. SDS-PAGE analysis showed more than 95% protein purity. The protein was concentrated to 22 mg/ml and subjected to crystallization trials. The protein was crystallized in 0.1 m Bis-Tris, pH 5.5, 0.2 m NaCl, and 25% w/v PEG3350 using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method (25Alaidarous M. Ve T. Ullah M.O. Valkov E. Mansell A.

The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 4c7m). Multiangle light scattering (MALS) coupled with size exclusion chromatography was performed using a DAWN HELEOS II 18-angle light scattering detector coupled with an Optilab rEX refractive index detector (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA) and combined inline with a pre-equilibrated Superdex 200 10/300 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare), using a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT (36van Dijk J.A.

The data were collected using 0.5-nm wavelength increments from 260 to 195 nm at 20 nm/min, with a spectral bandwidth of 1.0 nm, 0.1-mm path length cell, 0.5-s response time, and five accumulations. Purified TcpB-fl, TcpB120–250, TcpB70–250, and TcpB1–119 were gel-filtered using a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT, at 4 °C. Concentrations were obtained by UV absorbance at 280 nm. Data were collected at the SAXS/WAXS beamline of the Australian Synchrotron (Melbourne, Australia) on a Pilatus 1M detector at a sample to detector distance of 1.6 m. SAXS measurements were collected at 20 °C from dilution series made with post-peak gel filtration buffer. 90 μl of sample was injected through a 1.5-mm-diameter quartz capillary at a rate of 1 μl/s, capturing an image every 1 s.

https://openalex.org/W2006458328,"Interactions among Bcl-2 family proteins play critical roles in cellular life and death decisions. Previous studies have established the BH3-only proteins Bim, tBid, and Noxa as ""direct activators"" that are able to directly initiate the oligomerization and activation of Bak and/or Bax. Earlier studies of Puma have yielded equivocal results, with some concluding that it also acts as a direct activator and other studies suggesting that it acts solely as a sensitizer BH3-only protein. In the present study we examined the interaction of Puma BH3 domain or full-length protein with Bak by surface plasmon resonance, assessed Bak oligomerization status by cross-linking followed by immunoblotting, evaluated the ability of the Puma BH3 domain to induce Bak-mediated permeabilization of liposomes and mitochondria, and determined the effect of wild type and mutant Puma on cell viability in a variety of cellular contexts. Results of this analysis demonstrate high affinity (KD = 26 ± 5 nM) binding of the Puma BH3 domain to purified Bak ex vivo, leading to Bak homo-oligomerization and membrane permeabilization. Mutations in Puma that inhibit (L141E/M144E/L148E) or enhance (M144I/A145G) Puma BH3 binding to Bak also produce corresponding alterations in Bak oligomerization, Bak-mediated membrane permeabilization and, in a cellular context, Bak-mediated killing. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that Puma, like Bim, Noxa, and tBid, is able to act as a direct Bak activator."

We estimated the effect of climate change and human disturbance on a rock ptarmigan population living in the western Italian Alps by combining an empirical population modelling approach and stochastic simulations of the population dynamics under the a1B climate scenario and two different disturbance scenarios, represented by the development of a ski resort, through 2050.The early appearance of snow-free ground in the previous spring had a favorable effect on the rock ptarmigan population, probably through a higher reproductive success. On the contrary, delayed snowfall in autumn had a negative effect possibly due to a mismatch in time to molt to white winter plumage which increases predation risk. The regional climate model PROTHEUS does not foresee any significant change in snowmelt date in the study area, while the start date of continuous snow cover is expected to be significantly delayed. The net effect in the stochastic projections is a more or less pronounced (depending on the model used) decline in the studied population. The addition of extra-mortality due to collision with ski-lift wires led the population to fatal consequences in most projections. Should these results be confirmed by larger studies the conservation of Alpine populations would deserve more attention. To counterbalance the effects of climate change, the reduction of all causes of death should be pursued, through a strict preservation of the habitats in the present area of occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2069684901,"Adult muscle stem cells, satellite cells (SCs), endow skeletal muscle with tremendous regenerative capacity. Upon injury, SCs activate, proliferate, and migrate as myoblasts to the injury site where they become myocytes that fuse to form new muscle. How migration is regulated, though, remains largely unknown. Additionally, how migration and fusion, which both require dynamic rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, might be related is not well understood. c-MET, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is required for myogenic precursor cell migration into the limb for muscle development during embryogenesis. Using a genetic system to eliminate c-MET function specifically in adult mouse SCs, we found that c-MET was required for muscle regeneration in response to acute muscle injury. c-MET mutant myoblasts were defective in lamellipodia formation, had shorter ranges of migration, and migrated slower compared to control myoblasts. Surprisingly, c-MET was also required for efficient myocyte fusion, implicating c-MET in dual functions of regulating myoblast migration and myocyte fusion."

https://openalex.org/W2032787895,"Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF or BANF1) is highly conserved in multicellular eukaryotes and was first identified for its role in retroviral DNA integration. Homozygous BAF mutants are lethal and depletion of BAF results in defects in chromatin segregation during mitosis and subsequent nuclear envelope assembly. BAF exists both in phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms with phosphorylation sites Thr-2, Thr-3, and Ser-4, near the N terminus. Vaccinia-related kinase 1 is the major kinase responsible for phosphorylation of BAF. We have identified the major phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylation of Ser-4 to be protein phosphatase 4 catalytic subunit. By examining the cellular distribution of phosphorylated BAF (pBAF) and total BAF (tBAF) through the cell cycle, we found that pBAF is associated with the core region of telophase chromosomes. Depletion of BAF or perturbing its phosphorylation state results not only in nuclear envelope defects, including mislocalization of LEM domain proteins and extensive invaginations into the nuclear interior, but also impaired cell cycle progression. This phenotype is strikingly similar to that seen in cells from patients with progeroid syndrome resulting from a point mutation in BAF."

https://openalex.org/W2130159599,"Despite their differential effects on human metabolic pathophysiology, the differences in omental and subcutaneous lipidomes are largely unknown. To explore this field, liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used for lipidome analyses of adipose tissue samples (visceral and subcutaneous) selected from a group of obese subjects (n=38). Transcriptomics and in vitro studies in adipocytes were used to confirm the pathways affected by location. The analyses revealed the existence of obesity-related specific lipidome signatures in each of these locations, attributed to selective enrichment of specific triglycerides, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids, because these were not observed in adipose tissues from nonobese individuals. The changes were compatible with subcutaneous enrichment in pathways involved in adipogenesis, triacylglyceride synthesis, and lipid droplet formation, as well as increased α-oxidation. Marked differences between omental and subcutaneous depots in obese individuals were seen in the association of lipid species with metabolic traits (body mass index and insulin sensitivity). Targeted studies also revealed increased cholesterol (Δ56%) and cholesterol epoxide (Δ34%) concentrations in omental adipose tissue. In view of the effects of cholesterol epoxide, which induced enhanced expression of adipocyte differentiation and α-oxidation genes in human omental adipocytes, a novel role for cholesterol epoxide as a signaling molecule for differentiation is proposed. In summary, in obesity, adipose tissue exhibits a location-specific differential lipid profile that may contribute to explaining part of its distinct pathogenic role.—Jové, M., Moreno-Navarrete, J.

https://openalex.org/W1997706272,"Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the metabolized product and active element of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) that has been widely used for the prevention of acute graft rejection. MPA potently inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) that is up-regulated in many tumors and MPA is known to inhibit cancer cell proliferation as well as fibroblast and endothelial cell migration. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time MPA’s antimigratory and anti-invasion abilities of MPA-sensitive AGS (gastric cancer) cells. Genome-wide expression analyses using Illumina whole genome microarrays identified 50 genes with ≥2 fold changes and 15 genes with > 4 fold alterations and multiple molecular pathways implicated in cell migration. Real-time RT-PCR analyses of selected genes also confirmed the expression differences. Furthermore, targeted proteomic analyses identified several proteins altered by MPA treatment. Our results indicate that MPA modulates gastric cancer cell migration through down-regulation of a large number of genes (PRKCA, DOCK1, INF2, HSPA5, LRP8 and PDGFRA) and proteins (PRKCA, AKT, SRC, CD147 and MMP1) with promigratory functions as well as up-regulation of a number of genes with antimigratory functions (ATF3, SMAD3, CITED2 and CEAMCAM1). However, a few genes that may promote migration (CYR61 and NOS3) were up-regulated. Therefore, MPA’s overall antimigratory role on cancer cells reflects a balance between promigratory and antimigratory signals influenced by MPA treatment."

However, the molecular mechanism of UDCA in hepatic lipid metabolism remains largely unknown. In the present study, we show that SMILE negatively regulates LXRα transcriptional activity by directly interacting with LXRα and competes with the LXRα coactivator SRC-1. Moreover, we observed that SMILE overexpression inhibited LXRα-mediated Srebp-1c gene expression and decreased LXRα agonist-induced hepatic TG level and lipid accumulation. Moreover, UDCA treatment attenuated LXRα-mediated lipogenic gene expression, whereas SMILE knockdown released UDCA-mediated gene expression of Srebp-1c, Fas, and Acc. Overall, our results suggest that SMILE acts as a novel corepressor of LXRα and UDCA-induced SMILE gene expression, which leads to inhibition of LXRα-mediated hepatic lipogenic gene expression.

The shSMILE (AAGGCGTCGTCGTCTCTTAAA) constructs were constructed with a 21-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide containing +1053 to 1074 of the SMILE cDNA sequence into the pBS/U6 vector. The cDNA encoding shSMILE was cloned into the pAdTrack-CMV vector. pAdTrack-CMV-shSMILE was recombined with adenoviral gene carrier vector by transformation in pretransformed adEasy-BJ21-competent cells. The shAMPKα2 (ATCATCTTATCATTGACAATCGGAGAA) were constructed using double-stranded oligonucleotides containing +1071 to 1094 of the AMPKα2 cDNA sequence into the pBS/U6 vector and then adenoviral vector systems were used as previously described (12Nedumaran B.

The mice were anesthetized with Zoletile and their livers were exposed surgically. The liver was first perfused with resuspension buffer and then perfused with collagenase solution. Subsequently, the liver was finely chopped in a Petri dish and then filtered through 85-μm pore mesh. Hepatocytes were collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 2–5 min at 4 °C. Hepatocyte viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay and was consistently in excess of 85%. Hepatocytes were then seeded onto collagen type 1-coated 60-mm dishes as described previously (12Nedumaran B. Kim G.S. Hong S. Yoon Y.S. Kim Y.H. Lee C.H. Lee Y.C. Koo S.H. Choi H.S.

Once the animals were sacrificed, blood was immediately collected, and serum levels of TG and cholesterol were measured using chemistry analyzer kits (Hitachi 7150; Tokyo, Japan). Liver tissues were processed in paraffin after fixation in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. Tissue sections (3–4 μm thick) were deparaffininzed, rehydrated, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histological examination. The histological evaluation was carried out using a BX51 light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Histological damage in H&E sections was examined under a microscope at ×200 magnification. Fresh liver tissues were embedded carefully in OCT in a plastic mold after freezing at −80 °C. Tissue sections (8–10 μm thick) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature on a slide. The tissues were fixed with 10% formalin for 1 h, and then washed 60% isopropyl alcohol. Then 0.6% Oil Red-O working solution (w/v, 60% isopropyl alcohol and 40% water) was added to each slide for 30 min at room temperature, the solution was removed, and deionized water was added to wash the tissue. Fat droplets in the liver were stained red. SMILE knockdown was performed using the pSuper vector system (15Xie Y.B. Lee O.H. Nedumaran B. Seong H.A. Lee K.M. Ha H. Lee I.K. Yun Y. Choi H.S.

In brief, HepG2 cells in 60-mm culture dishes were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and solicited. The soluble chromatin was then subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-LXRα, anti-SMILE (sc-49329, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-interacting protein 1, anti-SRC-1, or anti-HA antibodies followed by treatment with Protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA (Upstate Biotechnology, Upstate, NY). Unrelated IgG was used a negative control for immunoprecipitation. Precipitated DNA was recovered via phenol/chloroform extraction, and DNA samples were quantified by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two pairs of primers encompassing the proximal (−300/−10 bp) or distal (−1800/−1500 bp) region of the mouse Srebp-1c promoter. The primers used for PCR were as follows: proximal, forward, 5′-TGGTTGCCTGTGCGGCAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-TCAGGCCCCGCCAGGCTTTAA-3′; distal, forward, 5′-GCTGGATGTCCAGGCTGAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCAGAGGTATGCAAGCAGA-3′.

Briefly, HepG2 cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors or small interfering RNA oligonucleotides and treated with T7. Cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and the membranes were probed with anti-HA, FLAG, SMILE, LXRα, SREBP1, FAS, ACC, or β-actin antibodies and developed after incubation with a secondary antibody using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. The statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance and results were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05 or p < 0.001. To investigate the role of SMILE in T7-induced lipogenic gene expression, we infected adenovirus expressing SMILE (Ad-SMILE) in T7-treated mouse primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. We found that adenoviral overexpression of SMILE significantly decreased T7-induced protein levels of LXRα target genes Srebp-1c, Fas, and Acc (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, adenoviral overexpression of SMILE significantly decreased mRNA levels of SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC in both primary mouse hepatocytes and HepG2 cells (Fig. 1, C and D). Taken together, these results indicate that SMILE inhibits LXRα-mediated lipogenic enzyme gene expression. To confirm whether SMILE inhibits LXRα transcriptional activity, 293T and HepG2 cells were co-transfected with SMILE, the LXRα expression vector, and the LXRα-specific reporter in the presence or absence of the LXRα agonist T7. Overexpression of SMILE strongly inhibited the activity of the LXRα-mediated reporter containing the LXR binding site (LXRE-luc) (Fig. 2, A and B). It has been rep"
https://openalex.org/W1973216250,"N6-isopentenyladenosine (iPA), an end product of the mevalonate pathway with an isopentenyl chain, is already known to exert a suppressor effect against various tumors. In this work, we investigated whether iPA also directly interferes with the angiogenic process, which is fundamental to tumor growth and progression. To this end, using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a suitable in vitro model of angiogenesis, we evaluated their viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, tube formation in response to iPA, and molecular mechanisms involved. Data were corroborated in mice by using a gel plug assay. iPA dose- and time-dependently inhibited all the neoangiogenesis stages, with an IC50 of 0.98 μM. We demonstrated for the first time, by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), that iPA was monophosphorylated into 5'-iPA-monophosphate (iPAMP) by the adenosine kinase (ADK) inside the cells. iPAMP is the active form that inhibits angiogenesis through the direct activation of AMP-kinase (AMPK). Indeed, all effects were completely reversed by pretreatment with 5-iodotubercidin (5-Itu), an ADK inhibitor. The isoprenoid intermediate isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), which shares the isopentenyl moiety with iPA, was ineffective in the inhibition of angiogenesis, thus showing that the iPA structure is specific for the observed effects. In conclusion, iPA is a novel AMPK activator and could represent a useful tool for the treatment of diseases where excessive neoangiogenesis is the underlying pathology."

In this study, disabling the eIF4F complex by targeting eIF4E with eIF4E-specific antisense oligonucleotide (4EASO) is assessed as a therapy for mesothelioma.Mesothelioma cells were transfected with 4EASO, designed to target eIF4E mRNA, or mismatch-ASO control. Cell survival was measured in mesothelioma treated with 4EASO alone or combined with either gemcitabine or pemetrexed. Levels of eIF4E, ODC, Bcl-2 and β-actin were assessed following treatment. Binding to a synthetic cap-analogue was used to study the strength of eIF4F complex activation following treatment.eIF4E level and the formation of eIF4F cap-complex decreased in response to 4EASO, but not mismatch control ASO, resulting in cleavage of PARP indicating apoptosis. 4EASO treatment resulted in dose dependent decrease in eIF4E levels, which corresponded to cytotoxicity of mesothelioma cells. 4EASO resulted in decreased levels of eIF4E in non-malignant LP9 cells, but this did not correspond to increased cytotoxicity. Proteins thought to be regulated by cap-dependent translation, Bcl-2 and ODC, were decreased upon treatment with 4EASO. Combination therapy of 4EASO with pemetrexed or gemcitabine further reduced cell number.4EASO is a novel drug that causes apoptosis and selectively reduces eIF4E levels, eIF4F complex formation, and proliferation of mesothelioma cells. eIF4E knockdown results in decreased expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-growth proteins and enhances chemosensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2105487161,"Leaf-cutting ants are evolutionary derived social insects with elaborated division of labor and tremendous colony sizes with millions of workers. Their social organization is mainly based on olfactory communication using different pheromones and is promoted by a pronounced size-polymorphism of workers that perform different tasks within the colony. The size polymorphism and associated behaviors are correlated to distinct antennal lobe (AL) phenotypes. Two worker phenotypes differ in number of olfactory glomeruli in the AL and the presence or absence of an extremely large glomerulus (macroglomerulus), involved in trail-pheromone reception. The males' AL contains three macroglomeruli which are presumably involved in detection of sex-pheromone components. We investigated the antennal transcriptome data of all major castes (males, queens and workers) and two worker subcastes (large and tiny workers). In order to identify putative odorant receptor genes involved in pheromone detection, we identified differentially expressed odorant receptor genes (OR-genes) using custom microarrays. In total, we found 185 OR-gene fragments that are clearly related to ORs and we identified orthologs for 70 OR-genes. Among them one OR-gene differs in relative expression between the two worker subcastes by a factor of >3 and thus is a very promising candidate gene for the trail-pheromone receptor. Using the relative expression of OR-genes in males versus queens, we identified 2 candidates for sex-pheromone receptor genes in males. In addition, we identified genes from all other chemosensory related gene families (13 chemosensory protein genes, 8 odorant binding protein genes, 2 sensory-neuron membrane protein genes, 7 ionotropic receptor genes, 2 gustatory receptor genes), and we found ant-specific expansions in the chemosensory protein gene family. In addition, a large number of genes involved in immune defense exhibited differential expression across the three different castes, and some genes even between the two worker subcastes."
https://openalex.org/W1992324654,"We developed an experimental autoimmune myositis (EAM) mouse model of polymyositis where we outlined the role of regulatory T (Treg) cells. Rapamycin, this immunosuppressant drug used to prevent rejection in organ transplantation, is known to spare Treg. Our aim was to test the efficacy of rapamycin in vivo in this EAM model and to investigate the effects of the drug on different immune cell sub-populations.EAM is induced by 3 injections of myosin emulsified in CFA. Mice received rapamycin during 25 days starting one day before myosin immunization (preventive treatment), or during 10 days following the last myosin immunization (curative treatment).Under preventive or curative treatment, an increase of muscle strength was observed with a parallel decrease of muscle inflammation, both being well correlated (R(2) = -0.645, p<0.0001). Rapamycin induced a general decrease in muscle of CD4 and CD8 T cells in lymphoid tissues, but spared B cells. Among T cells, the frequency of Treg was increased in rapamycin treated mice in draining lymph nodes (16.9 ± 2.2% vs. 9.3 ± 1.4%, p<0.001), which were mostly activated regulatory T cells (CD62L(low)CD44(high): 58.1 ± 5.78% vs. 33.1 ± 7%, treated vs. untreated, p<0.001). In rapamycin treated mice, inhibition of proliferation (Ki-67(+)) is more important in effector T cells compared to Tregs cells (p<0.05). Furthermore, during preventive treatment, rapamycin increased the levels of KLF2 transcript in CD44(low) CD62L(high) naive T cell and in CD62L(low) CD44(high) activated T cell.Rapamycin showed efficacy both as curative and preventive treatment in our murine model of experimental myositis, in which it induced an increase of muscle strength with a parallel decrease in muscle inflammation. Rapamycin administration was also associated with a decrease in the frequency of effector T cells, an increase in Tregs, and, when administered as preventive treatment, an upregulation of KFL2 in naive and activated T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1981207493,"Reduced levels of Substance P (SP), an endogenous neuropeptide endowed with neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic properties, have been found in brain and spinal fluid of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Potassium (K+) channel dysfunction is implicated in AD development and the amyloid-β (Aβ)-induced up-regulation of voltage-gated potassium channel subunits could be considered a significant step in Aβ brain toxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether SP could reduce, in vivo, Aβ-induced overexpression of Kv subunits. Rats were intracerebroventricularly infused with amyloid-β 25–35 (Aβ25–35, 20 µg) peptide. SP (50 µg/Kg, i.p.) was daily administered, for 7 days starting from the day of the surgery. Here we demonstrate that the Aβ infused rats showed impairment in cognitive performances in the Morris water maze task 4 weeks after Aβ25–35 infusion and that this impairing effect was prevented by SP administration. Kv1.4, Kv2.1 and Kv4.2 subunit levels were quantified in hippocampus and in cerebral cortex by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. Interestingly, SP reduced Kv1.4 levels overexpressed by Aβ, both in hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Our findings provide in vivo evidence for a neuroprotective activity of systemic administration of SP in a rat model of AD and suggest a possible mechanism underlying this effect."
https://openalex.org/W2053315684,"Bacterial cell wall components have been previously used as infection biomarkers detectable by antibodies. However, it is possible that the surface of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), also possesses molecules which might be non-antigenic. This makes the probing of biomarkers on the surface of M. tb cell wall difficult using antibodies. Here we demonstrate the use of phage display technology to identify peptides that bind to mycobacteria. We identified these clones using both random clone picking and high throughput sequencing. We demonstrate that random clone picking does not necessarily identify highly enriched clones. We further showed that the clone displaying the CPLHARLPC peptide which was identified by Illumina sequencing as the most enriched, binds better to mycobacteria than three clones selected by random picking. Using surface plasmon resonance, we showed that chemically synthesised CPLHARLPC peptide binds to a 15 KDa peptide from M.tb H37Rv whole cell lysates. These observations demonstrate that phage display technology combined with high-throughput sequencing is a powerful tool to identify peptides that can be used for investigating potential non-antigenic biomarkers for TB and other bacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W2085965159,"Young women in age-asymmetric relationships may be at an elevated risk for acquisition of HIV, since relationships with older men are also correlated with other risk behaviors like less condom use. Qualitative studies have shown that women are motivated to participate in these relationships for money and emotional support. However, there is a paucity of research on women’s perceived risks of these relationships, particularly in South Africa. To this end, we conducted in-depth interviews with 23 women recruited from three urban communities in Cape Town. A thematic question guide was used to direct the interviews. Thematic content analysis was used to explore women’s perceived risks of age-disparate and non-age-disparate relationships, the benefits of dating older men, and risk perceptions that influence decisions around beginning or ending a relationship. A plurality of women thought that dating an older man does not bring any adverse consequences, although some thought that older men do not use condoms and may be involved in concurrent partnerships. Many women were less inclined to date same-age or younger men, because they were viewed as being disrespectful and abusive. This study points to the need for more awareness raising about the risks of age-disparate relationships. In addition to these initiatives, there is an urgent need to implement holistic approaches to relationship health, in order to curb intimate partner violence, improve gender equity and make non-age-disparate relationships more attractive."

Monoclonal antibodies against mesothelin are being evaluated for the treatment of mesothelioma. Immunocytokines represent a novel class of armed antibodies. To provide an alternative approach to current mesothelin-targeted antibody therapies, we have developed a novel immunocytokine based on interleukin-12 (IL12) and the SS1 Fv specific for mesothelin. IL12 possesses potent anti-tumor activity in a wide variety of solid tumors. The newly-developed recombinant immunocytokine, IL12-SS1 (Fv), was produced in insect cells using a baculovirus-insect cell expression system. The SS1 single-chain Fv was fused to the C terminus of the p35 subunit of IL12 through a short linker (GSADGG). The single-chain IL12-SS1 (Fv) immunocytokine bound native mesothelin proteins on malignant mesothelioma (NCI-H226) and ovarian (OVCAR-3) cells as well as recombinant mesothelin on A431/H9 cells. The immunocytokine retained sufficient bioactivity of IL12 and significantly inhibited human malignant mesothelioma (NCI-H226) grown in the peritoneal cavity of nude mice and showed comparable anti-tumor activity to that of the SS1P immunotoxin. IL12-SS1 (Fv) is the first reported immunocytokine to mesothelin-positive tumors and may be an attractive addition to mesothelin-targeted cancer therapies."

Interestingly, embryos in which the gene for Cited2 has been deleted have no adrenal gland (1.Bamforth S.D. Bragança J. Eloranta J.J. Murdoch J.N. Marques F.I. Kranc K.R. Farza H. Henderson D.J.

In adult mice, hematopoietic stem cells are metabolically inactive, as evidenced by cell quiescence, whereas the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells is sensitive to changes in the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids (5.Simsek T.

Recently, by adenovirus-mediated delivery of Cited2 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) to mouse hepatocytes, it was demonstrated that Cited2 regulates gluconeogenesis by interacting with histone acetyltransferase GCN5 to affect acetylation and activity of peroxisome proliferative-activated receptor γ co-activator 1α (PGC-1α) (9.Sakai M.

Although Cited2 has been suggested as a crucial player in the regulation of gluconeogenesis, the role of Cited2 in glucose metabolism, especially glycolysis and oxidation phosphorylation in murine embryonic stem cells (mESC) remains elusive. The gene for Cited2 is present on chromosome 6q.23, a chromosomal region that is associated with genes involved in the control of insulin concentrations and insulin resistance in Mexican-Americans (10.Coletta D.K.

Indeed, Cited2 mRNA was down-regulated by insulin in skeletal muscle of 17 healthy volunteers exposed to acute physiological hyperinsulinemia (10.Coletta D.K. Balas B. Chavez A.O. Baig M. Abdul-Ghani M. Kashyap S.R. Folli F. Tripathy D. Mandarino L.J. Cornell J.E. Defronzo R.A. Jenkinson C.P. Effect of acute physiological hyperinsulinemia on gene expression in human skeletal muscle in vivo.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol Metab. 2008; 294: E910-E917Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, Cited2 mRNA was one of the top five up-regulated transcripts in 8 Type 2 diabetics, as compared with 8 non-diabetic subjects after low-dose insulin infusion (12.Asmann Y.W. Stump C.S. Short K.R. Coenen-Schimke J.M. Guo Z. Bigelow M.L. Nair K.S.

These studies strongly suggest that Cited2 plays an important role in insulin-mediated signaling pathways that regulate glucose metabolism in humans. ESCs represent a unique cell population that are characterized by their small size, rapid proliferation, and resistance to senescence, which provides a robust platform for metabolic studies (13.Wang J. Alexander P. Wu L. Hammer R. Cleaver O. McKnight S.L. Dependence of mouse embryonic stem cells on threonine catabolism.Science. 2009; 325: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In the undifferentiated state, the majority of glucose (80%) enters the glycolytic pathway to maintain ESC proliferation and self-renewal (14.Johnson M.T. Mahmood S. Patel M.S.

Lin-28 and c-Myc, two proteins that determine ESC pluripotency, also regulate glucose metabolism, suggesting a possible connection between the rate of glucose utilization and ESC self-renewal (16.Zhu H.

Moreover, metabolic fluctuations exist at different time points of ESC differentiation. In the early stages of differentiation into epiblast stem cells, 98% of glucose is consumed for lactate production (14.Johnson M.T. Mahmood S. Patel M.S. Intermediary metabolism and energetics during murine early embryogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31457-31460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At mid-to-late differentiation, ESCs undergo a metabolic switch from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to provide sufficient ATP for differentiation (19.Chung S. Dzeja P.P. Faustino R.S. Perez-Terzic C. Behfar A. Terzic A. Mitochondrial oxidative metabolism is required for the cardiac differentiation of stem cells.Nat. Clin. Pract. Cardiovasc.

Metabolic plasticity in stem cell homeostasis and differentiation.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11: 596-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). A metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis would thus favor reprogramming of terminally differentiated mouse fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (21.Folmes C.D. Nelson T.J. Martinez-Fernandez A. Arrell D.K. Lindor J.Z. Dzeja P.P. Ikeda Y. Perez-Terzic C. Terzic A. Somatic oxidative bioenergetics transitions into pluripotency-dependent glycolysis to facilitate nuclear reprogramming.Cell Metab. 2011; 14: 264-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Although the metabolic dynamics is critical for proper ESC differentiation, little is known about how ESC pro-differentiation factors modulate glucose homeostasis during this process. Cited2 was recently characterized as a pro-differentiation factor in the mouse ESCs (22.Li Q. Ramírez-Bergeron D.L. Dunwoodie S.L. Yang Y.C. Cited2 gene controls pluripotency and cardiomyocyte differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells through Oct4 gene.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 29088-29100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23.Yang S.H. Kalkan T. Morrisroe C. Smith A. Sharrocks A.D. A genome-wide RNAi screen reveals MAP kinase phosphatases as key ERK pathway regulators during embryonic stem cell differentiation.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1003112Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that mESCs with a deletion in the gene for Cited2 (Cited2Δ/−) have swollen mitochondria, increased mitochondrial number, and reduced mitochondrial function as reflected by a reduced rate of glucose oxidation. Impaired glucose oxidation and increased glycolytic activity in Cited2Δ/− ESCs is associated with defective differentiation during hypoxia. In particular, Cited2Δ/− ESCs display increased mRNA expression of pluripotency marker (Oct4) and epiblast marker (Fgf5), and defective mRNA induction of lineage markers (T, Gata-6, and Cdx2). Knockdown of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α in Cited2Δ/− ESCs re-initiates expression of lineage markers T and Gata-6. Furthermore, Cited2 is recruited to the HK1 gene promoter to directly modulate the expression of HK1, a key enzyme in glycolysis. Thus, Cited2 coordinates glucose metabolism, pluripotency, differentiation, and cell proliferation and is a potential target for metabolic reprogramming in ESCs. Cited2Flox/+ (hereafter referred to as wild type, WT) and Cited2Δ/− ESC (clone number 3) were utilized for most of the experiments performed in this study. To maintain ESCs under undifferentiated status in feeder-free culture system, WT and Cited2Δ/− ESCs stably transfected with Oct4-IRES-GFP-PuroR reporter plasmid were grown on gelatin-coated plates in complete ESC media (DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 25 mm glucose, 15% ES-qualified FBS (Germini), 2.5 mm Glutamax (Invitrogen), 1× non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen), and 1,000 IU/ml of ESGRO® leukemia inhibitory factor (Millipore)). ESCs were periodically selected with puromycin to maintain a population of undifferentiated ESC. ESCs were induced to differentiate via a methylcellulose-based method as described previously (22.Li Q. Ramírez-Bergeron D.L. Dunwoodie S.L. Yang Y.C. Cited2 gene controls pluripotency and cardiomyocyte differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells through Oct4 gene.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 29088-29100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For hypoxia experiments, ESCs were cultured or induced to differentiate in an incubator with an adjustable oxygen concentration, as described elsewhere (24.Han Y. Kuang S.Z. Gomer A. Ramirez-Bergeron D.L. Hypoxia influences the vascular expansion and differentiation of embryonic stem cell cultures through the temporal expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors in an ARNT-dependent manner.Stem Cells. 2010; 28: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Undifferentiated ES cells were cultured in 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes and media was collected at the indicated time points for measurement of glucose and lactate, as described elsewhere (25.Ballard F.J. Hanson R.W. Measurement of adipose-tissue metabolites in vivo.Biochem. J. 1969; 112: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26.Slein M.W. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press Inc., New York1965Google Scholar, 27.Hohorst H.J. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press Inc., New York1965Google Scholar). For primary embryoid bodies (EB) that were differentiating in methylcellulose-based semisolid media, the EBs were re-suspended at 37 °C in PBS and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was diluted 10-fold for the measurement of glucose and lactate via spectrophotometric methods. For glucose measurement, the sample was mixed with trithanolzmine buffer containing MgSO4, ATP/NADP, and Glc-6-PDH to record initial absorbance at 340 nm. Hexokinase solution was then added and the final absorbance was read when the absorbance was stabilized for 15 s. The absorbance difference was used for the calculation of glucose concentration. For lactate measurement, the sample was mixed with hydrazine/glycine buffer and NAD solution in a test tube and extinction E1 at 340 nm was recorded. After adding lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and the extinction E2 was determined. Extinction difference between E1 and E2 was then used to calculate lactate concentration. The relative percentage of glucose metabolized to lactate was utilized for the assessment of glycolytic activity (relative glucose conversion to lactate = [lactate production (μmol)]/[2× glucose consumption (μmol)] × 100%). Cell proliferation was assessed by a CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). The oxidation of [U-14C]-glucose, [2-14C]acetate, and [U-14C]glutamate to 14CO2 was determined as previously described (28.Jomain M. Hanson R.W. Dietary protein and the control of fatty acid synthesis in rat adipose tissue.J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 674-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 1–6 × 106 cells were resuspended in 2 ml of DMEM (11966-025, Invitrogen) in a flask that contained [U-14C]glucose (5 mm, 0.5 μCi), [2-14C]acetate (1 mm, 0.5 μCi), or [U-14C]glutamate (1 mm, 0.5 μCi) and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The experimental procedures and device used for release of 14CO2 trapping were described elsewhere (28.Jomain M. Hanson R.W. Dietary protein and the control of fatty acid synthesis in rat adipose tissue.J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 674-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Undifferentiated ESCs (5 × 104 cells) were seeded on gelatin-coated, 12-well plates and cultured for 2 days. Cells were fixed immediately with a triple aldehyde-dimethyl sulfoxide fixative and processed by the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine Electron Microscopy Core Facility. The total ATP content of ESCs was determined by using an adenosine 5′-triphosphate bioluminescent somatic cell assay kit (Sigma) as described elsewhere (29.Shen J. Liu X. Yu W.M. Liu J. Nibbelink M.G. Guo C. Finkel T. Qu C.K.

Biol. 2011; 31: 4902-4916Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). ESC oxygen consumption was determined using the Seahorse® XF-24 Bioanalyzer and Oxgraph-2K®-based platform. For the Seahorse XF-24-based assay, 120,000 undifferentiated ESCs were seeded on Cel-Tek® (BD)-coated XF-24 plates for 1 h. The assays were performed in the unbuffered XF-24 assay media in the presence of 25 mm glucose, 2.5 mm pyruvate, and 2 mm l-alanyl-glutamine (Glutamax). The rate of oxygen consumption at the basal level and upon treatment with oligomycin, p-trifluoromethoxy carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP), or rotenone was recorded sequentially. Respiration by ESCs was determined using an Oxygraph-2K®-based workshop (OROBOROS, Innsbruck, Austria) by re-suspending cells in MiR05 respiration buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm KH2PO4, 110 mm sucrose, 20 mm taurine, 60 mm K-lactobionate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA) (30.Gnaiger E. Kuznetsov A.V. Schneeberger S. Seiler R. Brandacher G. Steurer W. Margreiter R. Mitochondria in the Cold. Springer, Berlin2000Crossref Google Scholar) at the cell density of 1 × 106/ml. Prior to permeabilization, the basal level of oxygen consumption was monitored and the cells were then permeabilized with digitonin and different mitochondrial respiration substrates were added sequentially to determine the level of oxygen consumption (31.Ye F.

Total protein mass determined by a Bradford assay (Fisher) was used for the normalization of the oxygen consumption rate as described previously (32.Zhang J. Khvorostov I. Hong J.S. Oktay Y.

A MitoPTTM TMRM assay kit (ImmunoChemistry Technologies) was used to determine the mitochondria membrane potential. The level of the reduced form of reactive oxidative species in mitochondria was determined by MitoTracker® Orange CM-H2TMRos staining (Invitrogen, catalogue number M7511). Cells were incubated with TMRM (20 nm) or CM-H2TMRos (100 nm) at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark and subjected to analysis using a flow cytometer LSR-II (BD Biosciences). Genomic DNA was extracted using ArchivePure DNA cell/tissue kit (5 PRIME GmbH) and RNA was eliminated by RNase treatment. TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) was used for RNA isolation. One μg of the isolated RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using a High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems) and SYBR Green-based real-time PCR (Roche Applied Science) was performed using a Bio-Rad PCR cycler. Primer sequences used for this study are available upon request. 293T cells were co-transfected with pLKO-based GFP or with a HIF-1α shRNA plasmid (33.Nemetski S.M. Gardner L.B. Hypoxic regulation of Id-1 and activation of the unfolded protein response are aberrant in neuroblastoma.J. Biol.

After 72 h of incubation, the lentivirus supernatant was filtered and used for infection of ESCs. Stable cell lines with a knockdown of HIF-1α in ESCs were obtained by puromycin selection and validated with real-time PCR and Western blot assays. Undifferentiated ESCs (5 × 105 cells) were seeded on gelatin-coated 12-well plates. After overnight incubation, cells were replenished with complete ESC media or Hanks' balanced salt solution for 6 h. Cell lysates were harvested with RIPA buffer in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (eComplete, Roche Applied Science). Western blots were probed with antibodies to LC3 and p62 (Cell Signaling). ChIP assay was performed by following a standard protocol (34.Lee T.I. Johnstone S.E. Young R.A. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray-based analysis of protein location.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 729-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein-DNA complexes in WT ESCs were cross-linked with 1% paraformaldehyde and chromatins were sonicated to the average length of 300–500 base pairs. Chromatins were further immunoprecipitated with IgG or CITED2 antibody (R&D Systems) and the enrichment of CITED2 on the hexokinase 1 promoter region was determined by quantitative PCR and normalized to the IgG control (set as 1.0). The four regions randomly selected on the HK1 promoter were: R2, −2502 to −2284; R3, −1655 to −1452; R6, −831 to −609; and R7, −472 to −365 (all are relative distance to transcription start site of the HK1 gene). Student's t test was used to compare the difference between two groups. p < 0.05 is considered as a statistically significant difference. Media in the three independent Cited2Δ/− ESC clones previously generated via homologous recombination was noted to become acidic during EB-induced differentiation, as compared with the WT counterpart, suggesting that deletion of Cited2 may affect the rate of glucose conversion to lactate in ESCs. To gain insights into differential glucose metabolism between WT and Cited2Δ/− ESCs, glucose consumption and the conversion of glucose to lactate and carbon dioxide were measured. During 3 h of incubation, ESCs with Cited2 deletion consumed ∼20% more of glucose (Fig. 1A) and consequently produced ∼30% more lactate (Fig. 1B). Besides conversion to lactate by LDH, glucose-derived pyruvate can be oxidized in the mitochondria to acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which can then be oxidized to CO2 in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Compared with WT ESCs, undifferentiated Cited2Δ/− ESCs oxidized 75% less glucose to carbon dioxide (Fig. 1C). Unlike HEK293 cells (positive control), WT and Cited2Δ/− ESCs had a minimal capacity to oxidize [2-14C]acetate to carbon dioxide (Fig. 1D). [U-14C]Glutamate also used a substrate to determine the rate of oxidation of 5-carbon intermediates in the TCA cycle. When [U-14C]glutamate was provided in glucose-free DMEM, glutamate oxidation was barely detectable in WT and Cited2Δ/− ESCs (Fig. 1E). In addition, the ATP content was reduced by ∼30% in Cited2Δ/− ESCs (Fig. 1F). These results show that WT and Cited2Δ/− ESCs have a differentia"
https://openalex.org/W2006793347,"Background Epidemiologic and clinical studies of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) pulmonary disease typically use strict ATS/IDSA definitions designed for decisions about treatment. Studies based on these criteria may exclude a substantial number of patients with true disease. We reviewed patients treated for MAC pulmonary disease at an academic medical center to propose revised definitions encompass the full spectrum of MAC pulmonary disease. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of patients with MAC pulmonary disease treated from 1993–2006 by pulmonary or infectious disease specialists to assess whether treated patients met current ATS/IDSA microbiologic criteria and dichotomous radiologic classification as nodular/bronchiectatic (NB) or fibrocavitary (FC) disease. We propose a revised set of definitions that include categories of both probable and definite disease to include all treated patients. We further classify patients into dichotomous clinical categories as: “primary MAC” (without antecedent lung disease) or “secondary MAC” (smoking history or antecedent lung disease). Results Among 72 treated patients, 74% were female. Median age at diagnosis was 64 years; 41(57%) met ATS/IDSA criteria and 31 (43%) did not, most often for lack of multiple positive cultures. Dichotomous radiologic criteria were met by 48 (67%) patients (36 NB, 12 FC); the remaining 24 (33%) had both NB and FC findings or other abnormalities. Nineteen (26%) were classified as primary and 53 (74%) as secondary MAC (21 COPD, 4 bronchiectasis, 44 smoking history). Conclusions We propose revised definitions for epidemiologic and clinical studies of MAC pulmonary disease that describe the full spectrum of disease."

https://openalex.org/W2086117640,"Corneal stroma contains an extracellular matrix of orthogonal lamellae formed by parallel and equidistant fibrils with a homogeneous diameter of ~35 nm. This is indispensable for corneal transparency and mechanical functions. However, the mechanisms controlling corneal fibrillogenesis are incompletely understood and the conditions required for lamellar stacking are essentially unknown. Under appropriate conditions, chick embryo corneal fibroblasts can produce an extracellular matrix in vitro resembling primary corneal stroma during embryonic development. Among other requirements, cross-links between fibrillar collagens, introduced by tissue transglutaminase-2, are necessary for the self-assembly of uniform, small diameter fibrils but not their lamellar stacking. By contrast, the subsequent lamellar organization into plywood-like stacks depends on lysyl aldehyde-derived cross-links introduced by lysyl oxidase activity, which, in turn, only weakly influences fibril diameters. These cross-links are introduced at early stages of fibrillogenesis. The enzymes are likely to be important for a correct matrix deposition also during repair of the cornea."
https://openalex.org/W1972519629,"Global nutrient cycles have been altered by the use of fossil fuels and fertilizers resulting in increases in nutrient loads to aquatic systems. In the United States, excess nutrients have been repeatedly reported as the primary cause of lake water quality impairments. Setting nutrient criteria that are protective of a lakes ecological condition is one common solution; however, the data required to do this are not always easily available. A useful solution for this is to combine available field data (i.e., The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) National Lake Assessment (NLA)) with average annual nutrient load models (i.e., USGS SPARROW model) to estimate summer concentrations across a large number of lakes. In this paper we use this combined approach and compare the observed total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TN) concentrations in Northeastern lakes from the 2007 National Lake Assessment to those predicted by the Northeast SPARROW model. We successfully adjusted the SPARROW predictions to the NLA observations with the use of Vollenweider equations, simple input-output models that predict nutrient concentrations in lakes based on nutrient loads and hydraulic residence time. This allows us to better predict summer concentrations of TN and TP in Northeastern lakes and ponds. On average we improved our predicted concentrations of TN and TP with Vollenweider models by 18.7% for nitrogen and 19.0% for phosphorus. These improved predictions are being used in other studies to model ecosystem services (e.g., aesthetics) and dis-services (e.g. cyanobacterial blooms) for ~18,000 lakes in the Northeastern United States."

Several lines of evidence support the role of HIV-1 Env in inducing bystander apoptosis that may be a contributing factor in CD4+ T cell loss. However, most of the studies testing this phenomenon have been conducted with laboratory-adapted HIV-1 isolates. This raises the question of whether primary Envs derived from HIV-infected patients are capable of inducing bystander apoptosis and whether specific Env signatures are associated with this phenomenon. We developed a high throughput assay to determine the bystander apoptosis inducing activity of a panel of primary Envs. We tested 38 different Envs for bystander apoptosis, virion infectivity, neutralizing antibody sensitivity, and putative N-linked glycosylation sites along with a comprehensive sequence analysis to determine if specific sequence signatures within the viral Env are associated with bystander apoptosis. Our studies show that primary Envs vary considerably in their bystander apoptosis-inducing potential, a phenomenon that correlates inversely with putative N-linked glycosylation sites and positively with virion infectivity. By use of a novel phylogenetic analysis that avoids subtype bias coupled with structural considerations, we found specific residues like Arg-476 and Asn-425 that were associated with differences in bystander apoptosis induction. A specific role of these residues was also confirmed experimentally. These data demonstrate for the first time the potential of primary R5 Envs to mediate bystander apoptosis in CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, we identify specific genetic signatures within the Env that may be associated with the bystander apoptosis-inducing phenotype.

Furthermore, we identify specific genetic signatures within the Env that may be associated with the bystander apoptosis-inducing phenotype. The mechanism behind the slow but progressive depletion of CD4+ T cells in HIV infection remains a pertinent yet unanswered question. Various hypotheses have been proposed for this HIV-induced CD4+ T cell depletion like direct cell killing due to infection (1Gandhi R.T. Chen B.K. Straus S.E. Dale J.K. Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D.

One of the best studied phenomena associated with HIV Env is the evolution of virus from a CCR5-utilizing phenotype (non-syncytia-inducing) early during the infection to a CXCR4-utilizing phenotype later during the disease (15Edo-Matas D.

Comparison of in vivo in vitro evolution of CCR5 to CXCR4 coreceptor use of primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 variants.Virology. 2011; 412: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This change in co-receptor use has been associated with evolution of the virus to a syncytia-inducing phenotype, leading to rapid decline in CD4 counts and accelerated disease progression (23Schuitemaker H. Koot M. Kootstra N.A. Dercksen M.W. de Goede R.E. van Steenwijk R.P. Lange J.M. Schattenkerk J.K. Miedema F. Tersmette M.

Progression of disease is associated with a shift from monocytotropic to T-cell-tropic virus population.J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1354-1360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, co-receptor switch is not an absolute requirement for disease progression, and in ∼50% of the patients evolution of virus to X4 usage does not occur prior to AIDS development or terminal disease (24Jansson M.

Interestingly, these AIDS-associated R5 viruses have been shown to be more fusogenic than early asymptomatic phase viruses (26Olivieri K. Scoggins R.M. Bor Y.C. Matthews A. Mark D. Taylor Jr., J.R. Chernauskas D. Hammarskjöld M.L. Rekosh D. Camerini D.

Furthermore, the evolution of virus toward X4 usage has also been variable between different subtypes of HIV with lower rates of X4 tropism seen in subtype C viruses (28Björndal A. Sönnerborg A. Tscherning C. Albert J. Fenyö E.M. Phenotypic characteristics of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype C isolates of Ethiopian AIDS patients.AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1999; 15: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These findings emphasize the importance of the viral Env in regulating the course of disease with more fusogenic Envs being potentially more deleterious to CD4+ T cells versus the less fusogenic ones. HIV disease progression is a complex interplay between several viral and host factors. The host immune system in most cases can suppress the virus to undetectable set point/levels after an acute phase. The CD8 cytotoxic T cell response (29McDermott A.B. Koup R.A. CD8+ T cells in preventing HIV infection and disease.AIDS. 2012; 26: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Streeck H. Nixon D.F. T cell immunity in acute HIV-1 infection.J. Infect. Dis. 2010; 202: S302-S308Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and the neutralizing antibody production are largely responsible for the viral control leading into the chronic phase. During the chronic phase, the highest selection pressure due to neutralizing antibodies is on the Env glycoprotein of the virus (31Mosier D.E. HIV-1 envelope evolution and vaccine efficacy.Curr. Drug Targets Infect. Disord. 2005; 5: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which undergoes rapid evolution via changes in the pattern of N-glycosylation and charge on the Env glycoprotein (32Borggren M.

Recently, several genetic signatures have been identified that can distinguish viruses from different stages of the disease that include but are not limited to changes in putative N-glycosylation sites (PNGS) (18Curlin M.E.

Moreover, during the course of intrapatient HIV-1 evolution, it is also documented that the viral Env acquires mutations that alter CD4 binding and/or Env fusogenicity (36Li S. Juarez J. Alali M.

We and others have extensively studied the phenomenon of bystander apoptosis mediated by HIV Env both in vitro (40Garg H. Joshi A. Freed E.O. Blumenthal R.

Our studies demonstrate that Env fusogenic activity determines bystander apoptosis and CD4 decline but not virus replication (11Garg H. Joshi A. Ye C. Shankar P. Manjunath N. Single amino acid change in gp41 region of HIV-1 alters bystander apoptosis and CD4 decline in humanized mice.Virol. J. 2011; 8: 34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, with respect to R5 viruses, using cell lines that express different levels of CCR5, we have shown that cell surface CCR5 expression levels determine Env-mediated bystander apoptosis (44Joshi A. Nyakeriga A.M. Ravi R. Garg H. HIV ENV glycoprotein-mediated bystander apoptosis depends on expression of the CCR5 co-receptor at the cell surface and ENV fusogenic activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 36404-36413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although experimental data from us and others demonstrate that bystander apoptosis can be induced by HIV Env in vitro, the clinical implication of these findings is limited due to a lack of data from primary HIV isolates and patient-derived Env clones. In this study, we developed a high throughput assay to study a panel of primary patient-derived HIV Envs for their bystander apoptosis-inducing activity and determined its correlation with both phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the Envs. These included virus infectivity, sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies, putative N-glycosylation sites, Env charge, and association of specific residues in the Env with bystander apoptosis. Our study demonstrates that although primary R5 Envs vary considerably in their bystander apoptosis-inducing potential, the phenomenon correlates inversely with PNGS and to some extent neutralizing antibody sensitivity. Moreover, using computational sequence and structure analysis, we identified specific Env signatures associated with differential bystander apoptosis-inducing phenotypes. Specific residues associated with these signatures were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis experiments. These findings not only corroborate the role of viral Env in bystander apoptosis but take our previous studies a step further in attempting to identify specific Env signatures associated with bystander apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study aimed at studying the bystander apoptosis-inducing activity of a large panel of primary Envs utilizing a high throughput assay and correlating this phenomenon with specific Env signatures. SupT1 cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin streptomycin (5000 units/ml). SupT1 cells expressing CCR5 were generated by transduction of wild type SupT1 cells with a lentiviral vector expressing the CCR5 gene and have been described previously (44Joshi A. Nyakeriga A.M. Ravi R. Garg H. HIV ENV glycoprotein-mediated bystander apoptosis depends on expression of the CCR5 co-receptor at the cell surface and ENV fusogenic activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 36404-36413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin streptomycin (5000 units/ml) and blasticidin at a concentration of 3 μg/ml. 293T, HeLa, and TZM-bl cells (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (5000 units/ml). TZM-bl are HeLa-derived cells that express the HIV receptor CD4 and the co-receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 along with the luciferase and β-galactosidase genes under the control of HIV LTR (45Platt E.J.

These constructs include different patient-derived primary Envs as insert in the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). For the purpose of comparison and to be used as normalizing control, we used a laboratory-adapted R5-utilizing HIV-1 clone, YU-2. The YU-2 Env was thus similarly cloned into the pcDNA3.1 directional Topo expression vector (Invitrogen) and contains the open reading frames for the env and rev genes. Point mutations were introduced into different Env constructs using specific mutagenic primers and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The introduced mutations were confirmed by sequencing. For detection of Env expression, HeLa cells transfected with the various Envs were cultured in growth medium devoid of methionine and cysteine and supplemented with [35S]Met/Cys. Thereafter, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with HIV-Ig (kindly provided by the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by PhosphorImager analysis. HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 7500 cells/well and transfected with various Env constructs using the Exgen 500 transfection reagent. The next day, SupT-R5-H6 cells were added at 40,000 cells/well. The cells were co-cultured for 24 h, following which caspase-3 substrate was added directly to the wells (Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, Promega). The plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and read on a luminescence plate reader (Fluostar Omega, BMG LabScience). The Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay is a luminescence-based assay that directly measures caspase-3/7 activity in cultures. Apoptosis for each Env was calculated as the percentage of YU-2 Env-mediated apoptosis after subtraction of the background derived from pcDNA3.1 empty vector-transfected cells. To determine if bystander apoptosis induction by primary Envs requires CCR5 binding or gp41-mediated membrane fusion, the gp41 inhibitor enfuvirtide (used at a concentration of 2 μm) or CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc (used at a concentration of 1 μm) was added at the time when SupT-R5-H6 were added to each well. After an overnight incubation, the cultures were assaye"
https://openalex.org/W2162821989,"A novel methodology is described for the efficient and divergent synthesis of pseudodisaccharides, molecules comprising of amino carbasugar analogues linked to natural sugars. The methodology is general and enables the introduction of diversity both at the carbasugar and the natural sugar components of the pseudodisaccharides. Using this approach, a series of pseudodisaccharides are synthesised that mimic the repeating backbone unit of heparan sulfate, and are tested for inhibition of heparanase, a disease-relevant enzyme that hydrolyses heparan sulfate. A new homology model of human heparanase is described based on a family 79 β-glucuronidase. This model is used to postulate a computational rationale for the observed activity of the different pseudodisaccharides and provide valuable information that informs the design of potential inhibitors of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1987060427,"β-Arrestin is a scaffold protein that regulates signal transduction by seven transmembrane-spanning receptors. Among other functions it is also critically required for Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction. In the present study we provide for the first time a mechanistic basis for the β-arrestin function in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We demonstrate that β-arrestin is required for efficient Wnt3a-induced Lrp6 phosphorylation, a key event in downstream signaling. β-Arrestin regulates Lrp6 phosphorylation via a novel interaction with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)-binding protein Amer1/WTX/Fam123b. Amer1 has been shown very recently to bridge Wnt-induced and Dishevelled-associated PtdIns(4,5)P2 production to the phosphorylation of Lrp6. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching we show here that β-arrestin is required for the Wnt3a-induced Amer1 membrane dynamics and downstream signaling. Finally, we show that β-arrestin interacts with PtdIns kinases PI4KIIα and PIP5KIβ. Importantly, cells lacking β-arrestin showed higher steady-state levels of the relevant PtdInsP and were unable to increase levels of these PtdInsP in response to Wnt3a. In summary, our data show that β-arrestins regulate Wnt3a-induced Lrp6 phosphorylation by the regulation of the membrane dynamics of Amer1. We propose that β-arrestins via their scaffolding function facilitate Amer1 interaction with PtdIns(4,5)P2, which is produced locally upon Wnt3a stimulation by β-arrestin- and Dishevelled-associated kinases. β-Arrestin is a scaffold protein that regulates signal transduction by seven transmembrane-spanning receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2039035530,"The dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex play critical roles in mediating attention, working memory, and executive function. Despite proposed dynamic modulation of connectivity strength within each area according to task demands, scant empirical data exist about the time course of the strength of effective connectivity, particularly in tasks requiring information to be sustained in working memory. We investigated this question by performing time-resolved cross-correlation analysis for pairs of neurons recorded simultaneously at distances of 0.2–1.5 mm apart of each other while monkeys were engaged in working memory tasks. The strength of effective connectivity determined in this manner was higher throughout the trial in the posterior parietal cortex than the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Significantly higher levels of parietal effective connectivity were observed specifically during the delay period of the task. These differences could not be accounted for by differences in firing rate, or electrode distance in the samples recorded in the posterior parietal and prefrontal cortex. Differences were present when we restricted our analysis to only neurons with significant delay period activity and overlapping receptive fields. Our results indicate that dynamic changes in connectivity strength are present but area-specific intrinsic organization is the predominant factor that determines the strength of connections between neurons in each of the two areas."
https://openalex.org/W2049649016,"Multidomain protein folding is often more complex than a two-state process, which leads to the spontaneous folding of the native state. Pepsin, a zymogen-derived enzyme, without its prosegment (PS), is irreversibly denatured and folds to a thermodynamically stable, non-native conformation, termed refolded pepsin, which is separated from native pepsin by a large activation barrier. While it is known that PS binds refolded pepsin and catalyzes its conversion to the native form, little structural details are known regarding this conversion. In this study, solution NMR was used to elucidate the PS-catalyzed folding mechanism by examining the key equilibrium states, e.g. native and refolded pepsin, both in the free and PS-bound states, and pepsinogen, the zymogen form of pepsin. Refolded pepsin was found to be partially structured and lacked the correct domain-domain structure and active-site cleft formed in the native state. Analysis of chemical shift data revealed that upon PS binding refolded pepsin folds into a state more similar to that of pepsinogen than to native pepsin. Comparison of pepsin folding by wild-type and mutant PSs, including a double mutant PS, indicated that hydrophobic interactions between residues of prosegment and refolded pepsin lower the folding activation barrier. A mechanism is proposed for the binding of PS to refolded pepsin and how the formation of the native structure is mediated."
https://openalex.org/W2067399159,"Associations of cortisol and depression vary at different life-stages, yet population-based, prospective studies are scarce. We aimed to assess associations of morning cortisol with depressive symptoms in mid-life taking account of lifetime psychological health.Participants were 5,403 men and women from the 1958 British Birth Cohort whose salivary cortisol was assessed at 45y (45min after waking (T1) and 3h later (T2)) and who completed the 5-item Mental-Health Index (MHI-5) about depressive symptoms at age 50y. Lifetime psychological health was identified from child and adult measures.For women, higher T2 cortisol at 45y predicted depression (MHI-5 scores ≤52) at 50y (odds ratio [OR]=1.17; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.05,1.30 per standard deviation increase in T2 cortisol), attenuating when adjusted for current (45y) and previous (7-42y) psychological health (OR=1.11; 95% CI 0.98, 1.24). Similarly, an association in women of flatter cortisol delta (T2-T1) with depressive symptoms at 50y weakened after adjustment for current (45y) and previous (7-42y) psychological health. For men, lower T2 cortisol at 45y predicted greater depressive symptoms at 50y and the association strengthened when adjusted for lifetime psychological health. Likewise, lower cortisol AUC predicted higher risk of depression for men after adjusting for prior psychological health (OR=0.85; CI 0.72, 1.00). Associations were largely unaltered by control for covariates.In women, higher cortisol in late morning at 45y is prospectively associated with depressive symptoms at 50y through a link with lifetime psychological health. In men, lower cortisol predicts subsequent symptoms, independent of depressive history."
https://openalex.org/W1982187894,"To determine the optimal standardized uptake value (SUV) of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, at which the PET-defined gross tumor volume (GTVPET) best matches with the pathological volume (GTVPATH) in the cervical cancer.Ten patients with the cervical cancer who underwent surgery were enrolled in this study. The excised specimens were processed for whole-mount serial sections and H-E staining. The tumor borders were outlined in sections under a microscope, histopathological images were scanned and the GTVPATH calculated. The GTVPET was delineated automatically by using various percentages relative to the maximal SUV and absolute SUV. The optimal threshold SUV was further obtained as the value at which the GTVPET best matched with the GTVPATH.An average of 85 ± 10% shrinkage of tissue was observed after the formalin fixation. The GTVPATH was 13.38 ± 2.80 cm(3) on average. The optimal threshold on percentile SUV and absolute SUV were 40.50% ± 3.16% and 7.45 ± 1.10, respectively. The correlation analysis showed that the optimal percentile SUV threshold was inversely correlated with GTVPATH (p<0.05) and tumor diameter (p<0.05). The absolute SUV was also positively correlated with SUVmax (p<0.05).The pathological volume could provide the more accurate tumor volume. The optimal SUV of FDG for PET imaging by use of GTVPATH as standard for cervical cancer target volume delineation was thus determined in this study, and more cases are being evaluated to substantiate this conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2065463698,"An EST sequence, designated JnRAP2-like, was isolated from tissue at the heartwood/sapwood transition zone (TZ) in black walnut (Juglans nigra L). The deduced amino acid sequence of JnRAP2-like protein consists of a single AP2-containing domain with significant similarity to conserved AP2/ERF DNA-binding domains in other species. Based on multiple sequence alignment, JnRAP2-like appears to be an ortholog of RAP2.6L (At5g13330), which encodes an ethylene response element binding protein in Arabidopsis thaliana. Real-time PCR revealed that the JnRAP2-like was expressed most abundantly in TZ of trees harvested in fall when compared with other xylem tissues harvested in the fall or summer. Independent transgenic lines over-expressing JnRAP2-like in Arabidopsis developed dramatic ethylene-related phenotypes when treated with 50 µM methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Taken together, these results indicated that JnRAP2-like may participate in the integration of ethylene and jasmonate signals in the xylem and other tissues. Given the role of ethylene in heartwood formation, it is possible JnRAP2-like expression in the transition zone is part of the signal transduction pathway leading to heartwood formation in black walnut."
