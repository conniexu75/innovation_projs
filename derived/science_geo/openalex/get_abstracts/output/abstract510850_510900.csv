We report somatic mutations of RNF43 in over 18% of colorectal adenocarcinomas and endometrial carcinomas. RNF43 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates Wnt signaling. Truncating mutations of RNF43 are more prevalent in microsatellite-unstable tumors and show mutual exclusivity with inactivating APC mutations in colorectal adenocarcinomas. These results indicate that RNF43 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in colorectal and endometrial cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1993860509,"Agonists of mouse STING (TMEM173) shrink and even cure solid tumors by activating innate immunity; human STING (hSTING) agonists are needed to test this therapeutic hypothesis in humans. The endogenous STING agonist is 2'3'-cGAMP, a second messenger that signals the presence of cytosolic double-stranded DNA. We report activity-guided partial purification and identification of ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (ENPP1) to be the dominant 2'3'-cGAMP hydrolyzing activity in cultured cells. The hydrolysis activity of ENPP1 was confirmed using recombinant protein and was depleted in tissue extracts and plasma from Enpp1(-/-) mice. We synthesized a hydrolysis-resistant bisphosphothioate analog of 2'3'-cGAMP (2'3'-cG(s)A(s)MP) that has similar affinity for hSTING in vitro and is ten times more potent at inducing IFN-β secretion from human THP1 monocytes. Studies in mouse Enpp1(-/-) lung fibroblasts indicate that resistance to hydrolysis contributes substantially to its higher potency. 2'3'-cG(s)A(s)MP is therefore improved over natural 2'3'-cGAMP as a model agonist and has potential as a vaccine adjuvant and cancer therapeutic."

https://openalex.org/W2146263384,"The dentate gyrus (DG) is a region in the hippocampal formation whose function declines in association with human aging and is therefore considered to be a possible source of age-related memory decline. Causal evidence is needed, however, to show that DG-associated memory decline in otherwise healthy elders can be improved by interventions that enhance DG function. We addressed this issue by first using a high-resolution variant of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the precise site of age-related DG dysfunction and to develop a cognitive task whose function localized to this anatomical site. Then, in a controlled randomized trial, we applied these tools to study healthy 50-69-year-old subjects who consumed either a high or low cocoa flavanol-containing diet for 3 months. A high-flavanol intervention was found to enhance DG function, as measured by fMRI and by cognitive testing. Our findings establish that DG dysfunction is a driver of age-related cognitive decline and suggest non-pharmacological means for its amelioration."

https://openalex.org/W2028380145,"The heat-shock response is a complex cellular program that induces major changes in protein translation, folding and degradation to alleviate toxicity caused by protein misfolding. Although heat shock has been widely used to study proteostasis, it remained unclear how misfolded proteins are targeted for proteolysis in these conditions. We found that Rsp5 and its mammalian homologue Nedd4 are important E3 ligases responsible for the increased ubiquitylation induced by heat stress. We determined that Rsp5 ubiquitylates mainly cytosolic misfolded proteins upon heat shock for proteasome degradation. We found that ubiquitylation of heat-induced substrates requires the Hsp40 co-chaperone Ydj1 that is further associated with Rsp5 upon heat shock. In addition, ubiquitylation is also promoted by PY Rsp5-binding motifs found primarily in the structured regions of stress-induced substrates, which can act as heat-induced degrons. Our results support a bipartite recognition mechanism combining direct and chaperone-dependent ubiquitylation of misfolded cytosolic proteins by Rsp5."

However, mutations in centriole biogenesis genes have been reported in primary microcephaly and Seckel syndrome, disorders without the hallmark clinical features of ciliopathies. Here we identify mutations in the genes encoding PLK4 kinase, a master regulator of centriole duplication, and its substrate TUBGCP6 in individuals with microcephalic primordial dwarfism and additional congenital anomalies, including retinopathy, thereby extending the human phenotypic spectrum associated with centriole dysfunction. Furthermore, we establish that different levels of impaired PLK4 activity result in growth and cilia phenotypes, providing a mechanism by which microcephaly disorders can occur with or without ciliopathic features."
https://openalex.org/W2065453240,"This study investigated the regulation of thermogenic capacity in classical brown adipose tissue (BAT) and subcutaneous inguinal (SC Ing) white adipose tissue (WAT) and how it affects whole-body energy expenditure in sedentary and endurance-trained rats fed ad libitum either low fat or high fat (HF) diets. Analysis of tissue mass, PGC-1α and UCP-1 content, the presence of multilocular adipocytes, and palmitate oxidation revealed that a HF diet increased the thermogenic capacity of the interscapular and aortic brown adipose tissues, whereas exercise markedly suppressed it. Conversely, exercise induced browning of the SC Ing WAT. This effect was attenuated by a HF diet. Endurance training neither affected skeletal muscle FNDC5 content nor circulating irisin, but it increased FNDC5 content in SC Ing WAT. This suggests that locally produced FNDC5 rather than circulating irisin mediated the exercise-induced browning effect on this fat tissue. Importantly, despite reducing the thermogenic capacity of classical BAT, exercise increased whole-body energy expenditure during the dark cycle. Therefore, browning of subcutaneous WAT likely exerted a compensatory effect and raised whole-body energy expenditure in endurance-trained rats. Based on these novel findings, we propose that exercise-induced browning of the subcutaneous WAT provides an alternative mechanism that reduces thermogenic capacity in core areas and increases it in peripheral body regions. This could allow the organism to adjust its metabolic rate to accommodate diet-induced thermogenesis while simultaneously coping with the stress of chronically increased heat production through exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2018056919,"Cyclin C was cloned as a growth-promoting G1 cyclin, and was also shown to regulate gene transcription. Here we report that in vivo cyclin C acts as a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor, by controlling Notch1 oncogene levels. Cyclin C activates an ‘orphan’ CDK19 kinase, as well as CDK8 and CDK3. These cyclin-C–CDK complexes phosphorylate the Notch1 intracellular domain (ICN1) and promote ICN1 degradation. Genetic ablation of cyclin C blocks ICN1 phosphorylation in vivo, thereby elevating ICN1 levels in cyclin-C-knockout mice. Cyclin C ablation or heterozygosity collaborates with other oncogenic lesions and accelerates development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). Furthermore, the cyclin C encoding gene CCNC is heterozygously deleted in a significant fraction of human T-ALLs, and these tumours express reduced cyclin C levels. We also describe point mutations in human T-ALL that render cyclin-C–CDK unable to phosphorylate ICN1. Hence, tumour cells may develop different strategies to evade inhibition by cyclin C. Through gene knockout experiments, Sicinski and colleagues reveal a role for cyclin C as a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acting through phosphorylation of intracellular Notch1, mediating its degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2088697121,"Bjarke Feenstra and colleagues identify common variants at six loci associated with general or MMR vaccine–related febrile seizures. The two loci specifically associated with MMR-related febrile seizures harbor the interferon-stimulated gene IFI44L and the measles virus receptor gene CD46. Febrile seizures represent a serious adverse event following measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination. We conducted a series of genome-wide association scans comparing children with MMR-related febrile seizures, children with febrile seizures unrelated to vaccination and controls with no history of febrile seizures. Two loci were distinctly associated with MMR-related febrile seizures, harboring the interferon-stimulated gene IFI44L (rs273259: P = 5.9 × 10−12 versus controls, P = 1.2 × 10−9 versus MMR-unrelated febrile seizures) and the measles virus receptor CD46 (rs1318653: P = 9.6 × 10−11 versus controls, P = 1.6 × 10−9 versus MMR-unrelated febrile seizures). Furthermore, four loci were associated with febrile seizures in general, implicating the sodium channel genes SCN1A (rs6432860: P = 2.2 × 10−16) and SCN2A (rs3769955: P = 3.1 × 10−10), a TMEM16 family gene (ANO3; rs114444506: P = 3.7 × 10−20) and a region associated with magnesium levels (12q21.33; rs11105468: P = 3.4 × 10−11). Finally, we show the functional relevance of ANO3 (TMEM16C) with electrophysiological experiments in wild-type and knockout rats."

https://openalex.org/W2027008808,"Lymph node biopsy is employed in many cancer surgeries to identify metastatic disease and to determine cancer stage, yet morbidity and diagnostic delays associated with lymph node biopsy could be avoided if noninvasive imaging of nodal involvement were reliable. Molecular imaging has potential in this regard; however, variable delivery and nonspecific uptake of imaging tracers have made conventional approaches ineffective clinically. Here we present a method of correcting for nonspecific uptake with injection of a second untargeted tracer that allows for quantification of tumor burden in lymph nodes. We confirmed the approach in an athymic mouse model of metastatic human breast cancer by targeting epidermal growth factor receptor, a cell surface receptor overexpressed by many cancers. We observed a significant correlation between in vivo (dual-tracer) and ex vivo measures of tumor burden (r = 0.97, P < 0.01), with an ultimate sensitivity of approximately 200 cells (potentially more sensitive than conventional lymph node biopsy)."
https://openalex.org/W2030704700,"β-Galactoside α2,6-sialyltranferase 1 (ST6GAL1) catalyzes the addition of terminal α2,6-sialylation to N-glycans. Increased expression of ST6GAL1 has been reported in diverse carcinomas and highly correlates with tumor progression. Here, we report that St6gal1 transcription and α2,6-sialylated N-glycans are up-regulated during TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in GE11 cells, requiring the Sp1 element within the St6gal1 promoter. Knockdown of St6gal1 strongly suppressed TGF-β-induced EMT with a concomitant increase in E-cadherin expression, a major determinant of epithelial cell adherens junctions. Conversely, overexpression of ST6GAL1 increased the turnover of cell surface E-cadherin and promoted TGF-β-induced EMT. Overexpressing β-galactoside α2,3-sialyltranferase 4 had little influence on EMT, indicating specificity for α2,6-sialylation. The basal mesenchymal phenotype of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells was partially reversed by ST6GAL1 silencing. Moreover, ST6GAL1 knockdown inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, but not Smad2, suggesting that ST6GAL1 contributes to EMT through a non-Smad signaling pathway. Taken together, our data indicate that ST6GAL1 promotes TGF-β-dependent EMT as well as maintenance of the mesenchymal state by growth signaling, providing a plausible mechanism whereby up-regulated ST6GAL1 may promote malignant progression."
https://openalex.org/W1999485420,"A new approach overcomes the hurdles of identifying large, complex structural variants in cancer genomes by directly comparing tumor and normal genome sequencing reads. The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has advanced our understanding of cancer. However, characterizing somatic structural variants in tumor genomes is still challenging because current strategies depend on the initial alignment of reads to a reference genome. Here, we describe SMUFIN (somatic mutation finder), a single program that directly compares sequence reads from normal and tumor genomes to accurately identify and characterize a range of somatic sequence variation, from single-nucleotide variants (SNV) to large structural variants at base pair resolution. Performance tests on modeled tumor genomes showed average sensitivity of 92% and 74% for SNVs and structural variants, with specificities of 95% and 91%, respectively. Analyses of aggressive forms of solid and hematological tumors revealed that SMUFIN identifies breakpoints associated with chromothripsis and chromoplexy with high specificity. SMUFIN provides an integrated solution for the accurate, fast and comprehensive characterization of somatic sequence variation in cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2016086898,"Throughout the CNS, gap junction-mediated electrical signals synchronize neural activity on millisecond timescales via cooperative interactions with chemical synapses. However, gap junction-mediated synchrony has rarely been studied in the context of varying spatiotemporal patterns of electrical and chemical synaptic activity. Thus, the mechanism underlying fine-scale synchrony and its relationship to neural coding remain unclear. We examined spike synchrony in pairs of genetically identified, electrically coupled ganglion cells in mouse retina. We found that coincident electrical and chemical synaptic inputs, but not electrical inputs alone, elicited synchronized dendritic spikes in subregions of coupled dendritic trees. The resulting nonlinear integration produced fine-scale synchrony in the cells' spike output, specifically for light stimuli driving input to the regions of dendritic overlap. In addition, the strength of synchrony varied inversely with spike rate. Together, these features may allow synchronized activity to encode information about the spatial distribution of light that is ambiguous on the basis of spike rate alone."
https://openalex.org/W2041247701,"Introduction Acute chikungunya (CHIKV) is predominantly an acute onset of excruciatingly painful, self-limiting musculoskeletal (MSK) arbovirus illness and this was further reported by us during the 2006 Indian epidemic [Chopra et al. Epidemiol Infect 2012]. Selected serum cytokines profile in subjects within one month of onset of illness is being presented. Methods Out of 509 clinical CHIKV cases (43% population) identified during a rural population survey, 225 subjects consented blood investigations. 132 examined within 30 days of febrile onset are the study cohort. Anti-CHIKV IgM and IgG antibodies tested by immunochromatography and indirect immunofluorescence respectively. Interferons (IFN)-α, -β and -γ, Interferon Gamma-Induced Protein-10 (CXCL-10/IP-10), Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-13 (IL-13), Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), Interleukin–4 (IL-4) and Interleukin–10 (IL-10) performed by ELISA. Samples collected from neighboring community a year prior to the epidemic used as healthy controls. Results Seropositivity for anti-CHIKV IgM and IgG was 65% and 52% respectively. IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, CXCL10/IP-10 and IL-1β showed intense response in early acute phase. Cytokines (particularly TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) was maximum in extended symptomatic phase and remained elevated in recovered subjects. Higher (p<0.05) IFN and IL-4 seen in patients seropositive for anti-CHIKV IgG. Elderly cases (≥65 years) showed elevated cytokines (except IFN) and anti-CHIKV antibodies near similar to younger subjects. Significant correlations (p<0.05) found between cytokines and clinical features (fatigue, low back ache, myalgia) and anti-CHIKV antibodies. Conclusion An intense cytokine milieu was evident in the early and immediate persistent symptomatic phase and in recovered subjects. Early persistent IgM and lower IgG to anti-CHKV and intense Th2 cytokine phenotype seem to be associated with delay in resolution of MSK symptoms. Intriguingly, maximum TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-13 with low anti-CHIKV IgM response found in subjects recovered from CHIKV within one month of illness."

https://openalex.org/W1970167171,"Studies in the West have shown lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among people taking a vegetarian diet, but these findings may be confounded and only a minority selects these diets. We evaluated the association between vegetarian diets (chosen by 35%) and CVD risk factors across four regions of India.Study participants included urban migrants, their rural siblings and urban residents, of the Indian Migration Study from Lucknow, Nagpur, Hyderabad and Bangalore (n = 6555, mean age-40.9 yrs). Information on diet (validated interviewer-administered semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire), tobacco, alcohol, physical history, medical history, as well as blood pressure, fasting blood and anthropometric measurements were collected. Vegetarians ate no eggs, fish, poultry or meat. Using robust standard error multivariate linear regression models, we investigated the association of vegetarian diets with blood cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, fasting blood glucose (FBG), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).Vegetarians (32.8% of the study population) did not differ from non-vegetarians with respect to age, use of smokeless tobacco, body mass index, and prevalence of diabetes or hypertension. Vegetarians had a higher standard of living and were less likely to smoke, drink alcohol (p<0.0001) and were less physically active (p = 0.04). In multivariate analysis, vegetarians had lower levels of total cholesterol (β = -0.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.03 to -0.2), p = 0.006), triglycerides (β = -0.05 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.007 to -0.01), p = 0.02), LDL (β = -0.06 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.005 to -0.1), p = 0.03) and lower DBP (β = -0.7 mmHg (95% CI: -1.2 to -0.07), p = 0.02). Vegetarians also had decreases in SBP (β = -0.9 mmHg (95% CI: -1.9 to 0.08), p = 0.07) and FBG level (β = -0.07 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.2 to 0.01), p = 0.09) when compared to non-vegetarians.We found beneficial association of vegetarian diet with cardiovascular risk factors compared to non-vegetarian diet."
https://openalex.org/W2081488649,"The scientific enterprise depends critically on the preservation of and open access to published data. This basic tenet applies acutely to phylogenies (estimates of evolutionary relationships among species). Increasingly, phylogenies are estimated from increasingly large, genome-scale datasets using increasingly complex statistical methods that require increasing levels of expertise and computational investment. Moreover, the resulting phylogenetic data provide an explicit historical perspective that critically informs research in a vast and growing number of scientific disciplines. One such use is the study of changes in rates of lineage diversification (speciation--extinction) through time. As part of a meta-analysis in this area, we sought to collect phylogenetic data (comprising nucleotide sequence alignment and tree files) from 217 studies published in 46 journals over a 13-year period. We document our attempts to procure those data (from online archives and by direct request to corresponding authors), and report results of analyses (using Bayesian logistic regression) to assess the impact of various factors on the success of our efforts. Overall, complete phylogenetic data for [Formula: see text] of these studies are effectively lost to science. Our study indicates that phylogenetic data are more likely to be deposited in online archives and/or shared upon request when: (1) the publishing journal has a strong data-sharing policy; (2) the publishing journal has a higher impact factor, and; (3) the data are requested from faculty rather than students. Importantly, our survey spans recent policy initiatives and infrastructural changes; our analyses indicate that the positive impact of these community initiatives has been both dramatic and immediate. Although the results of our study indicate that the situation is dire, our findings also reveal tremendous recent progress in the sharing and preservation of phylogenetic data."
https://openalex.org/W2085941058,"Sustainable management of crop productivity and health necessitates improved understanding of the ways in which rhizosphere microbial populations interact with each other, with plant roots and their abiotic environment. In this study we examined the effects of different soils and cultivars, and the presence of a soil-borne fungal pathogen, Verticillium dahliae, on the fungal microbiome of the rhizosphere soil and roots of strawberry plants, using high-throughput pyrosequencing. Fungal communities of the roots of two cultivars, Honeoye and Florence, were statistically distinct from those in the rhizosphere soil of the same plants, with little overlap. Roots of plants growing in two contrasting field soils had high relative abundance of Leptodontidium sp. C2 BESC 319 g whereas rhizosphere soil was characterised by high relative abundance of Trichosporon dulcitum or Cryptococcus terreus, depending upon the soil type. Differences between different cultivars were not as clear. Inoculation with the pathogen V. dahliae had a significant influence on community structure, generally decreasing the number of rhizosphere soil- and root-inhabiting fungi. Leptodontidium sp. C2 BESC 319 g was the dominant fungus responding positively to inoculation with V. dahliae. The results suggest that 1) plant roots select microorganisms from the wider rhizosphere pool, 2) that both rhizosphere soil and root inhabiting fungal communities are influenced by V. dahliae and 3) that soil type has a stronger influence on both of these communities than cultivar."
https://openalex.org/W2099200080,"An adverse effect of acid-suppression medications on the occurrence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has been a common finding of many, but not all studies. We hypothesized that association between acid-suppression medications and CDI is due to the residual confounding in comparison between patients with infection to those without, predominantly from non-tested and less sick subjects. We aimed to evaluate the effect of acid suppression therapy on incidence of CDI by comparing patients with CDI to two control groups: not tested patients and patients suspected of having CDI, but with a negative test.We conducted a case-control study of adult patients hospitalized in internal medicine department of tertiary teaching hospital between 2005-2010 for at least three days. Controls from each of two groups (negative for CDI and non-tested) were individually matched (1:1) to cases by primary diagnosis, Charlson comorbidity index, year of hospitalization and gender. Primary outcomes were diagnoses of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9)-coded CDI occurring 72 hours or more after admission.Patients with CDI were similar to controls with a negative test, while controls without CDI testing had lower clinical severity. In multivariable analysis, treatment by acid suppression medications was associated with CDI compared to those who were not tested (OR = 1.88, p-value = 0.032). Conversely, use of acid suppression medications in those who tested negative for the infection was not associated with CDI risk as compared to the cases (OR = 0.66; p = 0.059).These findings suggest that the reported epidemiologic associations between use of acid suppression medications and CDI risk may be spurious. The control group choice has an important impact on the results. Clinical differences between the patients with CDI and those not tested and not suspected of having the infection may explain the different conclusions regarding the acid suppression effect on CDI risk."
https://openalex.org/W1523341749,"Perturbations of astrocytes trigger neurodegeneration in several diseases, but the glial cell-intrinsic mechanisms that induce neurodegeneration remain poorly understood. We found that a protein complex of α2-Na/K ATPase and α-adducin was enriched in astrocytes expressing mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), which causes familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Knockdown of α2-Na/K ATPase or α-adducin in mutant SOD1 astrocytes protected motor neurons from degeneration, including in mutant SOD1 mice in vivo. Heterozygous disruption of the α2-Na/K ATPase gene suppressed degeneration in vivo and increased the lifespan of mutant SOD1 mice. The pharmacological agent digoxin, which inhibits Na/K ATPase activity, protected motor neurons from mutant SOD1 astrocyte-induced degeneration. Notably, α2-Na/K ATPase and α-adducin were upregulated in spinal cord of sporadic and familial ALS patients. Collectively, our findings define chronic activation of the α2-Na/K ATPase/α-adducin complex as a critical glial cell-intrinsic mechanism of non-cell autonomous neurodegeneration, with implications for potential therapies for neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2110972562,"TNF-alpha-related-apoptosis-inducing-ligand (TRAIL) has been explored as a therapeutic drug to kill cancer cells. Cancer cells in the circulation are subjected to apoptosis-inducing factors. Despite the presence of these factors, cells are able to extravasate and metastasize. The homotypic and heterotypic cell-cell interactions in a tumor are known to play a crucial role in bestowing important characteristics to cancer cells that leave the primary site. Spheroid cell culture has been extensively used to mimic these physiologically relevant interactions. In this work, we show that the breast cancer cell lines BT20 and MCF7, cultured as 3D tumor spheroids, are more resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by downregulating the expression of death receptors (DR4 and DR5) that initiate TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. For comparison, we also investigated the effect of TRAIL on cells cultured as a 2D monolayer. Our results indicate that tumor spheroids are enriched for CD44hiCD24loALDH1hi cells, a phenotype that is predominantly known to be a marker for breast cancer stem cells. Furthermore, we attribute the TRAIL-resistance and cancer stem cell phenotype observed in tumor spheroids to the upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE₂) pathway. We show that inhibition of the COX-2/PGE₂ pathway by treating tumor spheroids with NS-398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, reverses the TRAIL-resistance and decreases the incidence of a CD44hiCD24lo population. Additionally, we show that siRNA mediated knockdown of COX-2 expression in MCF7 cells render them sensitive to TRAIL by increasing the expression of DR4 and DR5. Collectively, our results show the effect of the third-dimension on the response of breast cancer cells to TRAIL and suggest a therapeutic target to overcome TRAIL-resistance."

In addition, it has an unusual long serum half-life in humans of nearly 3 weeks, which is attributed to its interaction with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). FcRn protects albumin from intracellular degradation via a pH-dependent cellular recycling mechanism. To understand how FcRn impacts the role of albumin as a distributor, it is of importance to unravel the structural mechanism that determines pH-dependent binding. Here, we show that although the C-terminal domain III (DIII) of human serum albumin (HSA) contains the principal binding site, the N-terminal domain I (DI) is important for optimal FcRn binding. Specifically, structural inspection of human FcRn (hFcRn) in complex with HSA revealed that two exposed loops of DI were in proximity with the receptor. To investigate to what extent these contacts affected hFcRn binding, we targeted selected amino acid residues of the loops by mutagenesis. Screening by in vitro interaction assays revealed that several of the engineered HSA variants showed decreased binding to hFcRn, which was also the case for two missense variants with mutations within these loops. In addition, four of the variants showed improved binding. Our findings demonstrate that both DI and DIII are required for optimal binding to FcRn, which has implications for our understanding of the FcRn-albumin relationship and how albumin acts as a distributor.

Albumin is synthesized by hepatocytes in the liver, which secrete an impressive 13–14 g of albumin into the blood every day. In the blood albumin plays a pivotal role as a transporter of a range of small insoluble molecules such as fatty acids, metal ions, hormones, heme, and bilirubin in addition to being a carrier of small chemical drugs (1Ghuman J.

This feature is of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry, as the exceptional half-life can be utilized to extend the serum persistence of therapeutics that are chemically or genetically linked to albumin (3Andersen J.T.

This is solely due to their molecular size above the renal clearance threshold and binding to a cellular receptor named the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) 8The abbreviations used are: FcRnneonatal Fc receptorhFcRnhuman FcRnHSAhuman serum albuminDIDII, DIII, domains I, II, and IIISPRsurface plasmon resonanceRUresonance units.

A genetic link is also found in humans, as the rare disease, familial hypercatabolic hypoproteinemia, is characterized by abnormally low levels of IgG and albumin, which correlate with a lack of FcRn expression (10Wani M.A. Haynes L.D.

Thus, FcRn is a regulator of the serum levels and circulatory half-lives of these structurally and functionally unrelated proteins.

This is mediated by histidine residues that become positively charged at acidic pH and are located to the elbow region of the IgG Fc, to DIII of albumin, and to the receptor itself (14Andersen J.T.

Long serum half-life is maintained via a cellular recycling mechanism that relies on the pH-dependent binding. FcRn resides predominantly within intracellular endosomes, into which IgG and albumin enter after pinocytosis and where they bind FcRn as a consequence of the low pH. The ternary complex is recycled to the cell surface where exposure to the physiological pH of the blood triggers release. Thus, FcRn rescues both its ligands from intracellular degradation, whereas proteins that do not bind the receptor are directed to lysosomes. This recycling pathway has been shown to take place in hematopoietic cells and endothelial cells lining the vascular space (8Montoyo H.P. Vaccaro C. Hafner M. Ober R.J. Mueller W. Ward E.S.

Regarding albumin, recent insights into the mechanism of the FcRn-albumin interaction have resulted in publication of the first examples of engineered HSA mutant variants with altered pH-dependent binding to hFcRn, which translates into decreased or increased serum half-life in both mice and rhesus monkeys (18Schmidt M.M.

Furthermore, in regard to conjugation or genetic fusion of biopharmaceuticals to HSA, it is important to control how FcRn binding is affected. Importantly, we recently showed that fusion of a short peptide or an antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment to either the N- or C-terminal end of HSA or both ends has only minor influence on binding to hFcRn (29Andersen J.T.

To gain insight into how FcRn binds albumin pH dependently, we and others have previously reported on mapping of the core FcRn-albumin interaction interface using site-directed mutagenesis (14Andersen J.T.

These studies revealed that the C-terminal DIII contains the principal binding site for FcRn. Three fully conserved histidine residues on DIII are players in both direct binding to FcRn and in internal interactions of the protein (16Andersen J.T. Dalhus B. Cameron J. Daba M.B. Plumridge A.

Another interesting finding was that a recombinant form of DIII bound hFcRn but with reduced affinity compared with full-length HSA (16Andersen J.T. Dalhus B. Cameron J. Daba M.B. Plumridge A. Evans L. Brennan S.O. Gunnarsen K.S. Bj⊘rås M. Sleep D. Sandlie I. Structure-based mutagenesis reveals the albumin-binding site of the neonatal Fc receptor.Nat.

Biochem. 2010; 43: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, based on a large set of mutagenesis studies, we constructed a docking model of the FcRn-HSA complex using the available crystallographic data of hFcRn and wild type (WT) HSA (16Andersen J.T. Dalhus B. Cameron J. Daba M.B. Plumridge A. Evans L. Brennan S.O. Gunnarsen K.S. Bj⊘rås M. Sleep D. Sandlie I. Structure-based mutagenesis reveals the albumin-binding site of the neonatal Fc receptor.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 610Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The best model suggested that the N-terminal DI may also make direct contacts with hFcRn, which was also confirmed by two recently published co-crystal structures of hFcRn in complex with a WT HSA molecule or a HSA mutant containing four amino acid substitutions (HSA13) that binds the receptor but with reduced pH discrimination (18Schmidt M.M.

Notably, the co-crystal structures show a fit that differs somewhat from the docking model due to changes in conformation and orientation of the three HSA subdomains upon binding to FcRn, including alterations within DIII whereby DIIIb rotates relative to DIIIa (18Schmidt M.M.

Stretches of amino acid residues in two exposed loops within DI were targeted by mutagenesis, and the mutant HSA variants were expressed and compared with WT HSA with respect to binding to hFcRn using in vitro binding assays. A total of 12 amino acid residues were replaced with alanine residues. Four mutations negatively affected binding to hFcRn, whereas four improved binding. Two of the mutants shown to bind hFcRn less well are naturally existing missense HSA variants. Thus, we demonstrate that not only DIII but also DI of albumin is important for optimal pH-dependent binding to FcRn, and we pinpoint amino acid residues within two exposed loops of DI that are important for receptor binding. Our data have implications for our understanding on how FcRn regulates the long serum half-life of albumin and transports its cargo throughout the body, and such knowledge will translate into design of novel albumin-based therapeutics with improved properties.

A viral stock encoding His-tagged hFcRn was a kind gift from Dr. Sally Ward (University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX).

The column was preequilibrated with 1× PBS with 0.05% sodium azide, and the pH of the supernatant was adjusted with 1× PBS, 0.05% sodium azide (pH 10.9) to pH 7.2 before being applied to the HisTrap HP column with a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The column was washed using 200 ml of 1× PBS followed by 50 ml of 25 mm imidazole, 1× PBS (pH 7.3), and hFcRn was eluted with 250 mm imidazole, 1× PBS (pH 7.4). The collected protein was buffer-exchanged to 1× PBS using Amicron Ultra-10 filter units (Millipore) followed by isolation of the monomeric fraction. A HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 200 prep grade column (GE Healthcare) was used to isolate the monomeric fraction before the protein was concentrated using Amicon Ultra columns (Millipore) and stored at 4 °C. Recombinant WT HSA, HSA-K500A, and the fragments DI-DII, DIII, and DIII-K500A were constructed, produced in yeast, and purified essentially as previously described (16Andersen J.T. Dalhus B.

With a specific focus on the extra-time period, and using a within-match approach, we examined the influence of prolonged durations of professional soccer match-play on markers of technical (i.e., skilled) performance. In 18 matches involving professional European teams played between 2010 and 2014, this retrospective study quantified the technical actions observed during eight 15-minute epochs (E1: 00∶00–14∶59 min, E2: 15∶00–29∶59 min, E3: 30∶00–44∶59 min, E4: 45∶00–59∶59 min, E5: 60∶00–74∶59 min, E6: 75∶00–89∶59 min, E7: 90∶00–104∶59 min, E8: 105∶00–119∶59 min). Analysis of players who completed the demands of the full 120 min of match-play revealed that the cumulative number of successful passes observed during E8 (61±23) was lower than E1–4 (E1: 88±23, P = 0.001; E2: 77±21, P = 0.005; E3: 79±18, P = 0.001; E4: 80±21, P = 0.001) and E7 (73±20, P = 0.002). Similarly, the total number of passes made in E8 (71±25) was reduced when compared to E1 (102±22, P = 0.001), E3 (91±19, P = 0.002), E4 (93±22, P≤0.0005) and E7 (84±20, P = 0.001). The cumulative number of successful dribbles reduced in E8 (9±4) when compared to E1 (14±4, P = 0.001) and E3 (12±4, P≤0.0005) and the total time the ball was in play was less in E8 (504±61 s) compared to E1 (598±70 s, P≤0.0005). These results demonstrate that match-specific factors reduced particular indices of technical performance in the second half of extra-time. Interventions that seek to maintain skilled performance throughout extra-time warrant further investigation."

MetS components included body mass index (BMI), mean arterial pressure (MAP), triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDLC), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA). Observed/expected (O/E) ratio and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) were used as a measure of the degree of clustering of categorical and continuous MetS variables, respectively.UA was positively and significantly associated only with BMI in children but with all four components in adults. The odds ratio for MetS associated with 1 mg/dL increase of UA was 1.74 (p<0.001) in children and 1.92 (p<0.001) in adults. O/E ratios showed a significant, increasing trend with increasing UA quartiles in both children and adults for 3- and 4-variable clusters with p-values for trend <0.001, except for BMI-MAP-TG/HDLC and MAP-TG/HDLC-HOMA clusters in children and MAP-TG/HDLC-HOMA cluster in adults. ICCs of 3 and 4 components increased with increasing UA quartiles in children and adults.These results indicate that UA may play a role in the development of MetS in both pediatric and adult populations alike, which may aid in the identification and treatment of high risk individuals for MetS and related clinical disorders in early life."
https://openalex.org/W1967572648,"E2F1 and FOXO3 are two transcription factors that have been shown to participate in cellular senescence. Previous report reveals that E2F1 enhanced cellular senescence in human fibroblast cells, while FOXO transcription factors play against senescence by regulation reactive oxygen species scavenging proteins. However, their functional interplay has been unclear. Here we use E2F1 knock-out murine Embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), knockdown RNAi constructs, and ectopic expression of E2F1 to show that it functions by negatively regulating FOXO3. E2F1 attenuates FOXO3-mediated expression of MnSOD and Catalase without affecting FOXO3 protein stability, subcellular localization, or phosphorylation by Akt. We mapped the interaction between E2F1 and FOXO3 to a region including the DNA binding domain of E2F1 and the C-terminal transcription-activation domain of FOXO3. We propose that E2F1 inhibits FOXO3-dependent transcription by directly binding FOXO3 in the nucleus and preventing activation of its target genes. Moreover, knockdown of the Caenorhabditis elegans E2F1 ortholog efl-1 significantly extends lifespan in a manner that requires the activity of the C. elegans FOXO gene daf-16. We conclude that there is an evolutionarily conserved signaling connection between E2F1 and FOXO3, which regulates cellular senescence and aging by regulating the activity of FOXO3. We speculate that drugs and/or therapies that inhibit this physical interaction might be good candidates for reducing cellular senescence and increasing longevity."
https://openalex.org/W2018395737,"Background and Design In this study we set out to determine the effects of long-term physical training on hemorheological, laboratory parameters, exercise tolerability, psychological factors in cardiac patients participating in an ambulatory rehabilitation program. Methods Before physical training, patients were examined by echocardiography, tested on treadmill by the Bruce protocol, and blood was drawn for laboratory tests. The enrolled 79 ischemic heart disease patients joined a 24-week cardiac rehabilitation training program. Blood was drawn to measure hematocrit (Hct), plasma and whole blood viscosity (PV, WBV), red blood cell (RBC) aggregation and deformability. Hemorheological, clinical chemistry and psychological measurements were repeated 12 and 24 weeks later, and a treadmill test was performed at the end of the program. Results After 12 weeks Hct, PV, WBV and RBC aggregation were significantly decreased, RBC deformability exhibited a significant increase (p<0.05). Laboratory parameters (triglyceride, uric acid, hsCRP and fibrinogen) were significantly decreased (p<0.05). After 24 weeks the significant results were still observed. By the end of the study, IL-6 and TNF-α levels displayed decreasing trends (p<0.06). There was a significant improvement in MET (p<0.001), and the BMI decrease was also significant (p<0.05). The vital exhaustion parameters measured on the fatigue impact scale indicated a significant improvement in two areas of the daily activities (p<0.05). Conclusions Regular physical training improved the exercise tolerability of patients with ischemic heart disease. Previous publications have demonstrated that decreases in Hct and PV may reduce cardiovascular risk, while a decrease in RBC aggregation and an increase in deformability improve the capillary flow. Positive changes in laboratory parameters and body weight may indicate better oxidative and inflammatory circumstances and an improved metabolic state. The psychological findings point to an improvement in the quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2095374056,"Recently many genetic mutations that are associated with epilepsy have been identified. The protein NIPA2 (non-imprinted in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome region protein 2) is a highly selective magnesium transporter encoded by the gene NIPA2 in which we have found three mutations (p.I178F, p.N244S and p.N334_E335insD) within a population of patients with childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). In this study, immunofluorescence labeling, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), MTT metabolic rate detection and computational modeling were utilized to elucidate how these mutations result in CAE. We found in cultured neurons that NIPA2 (wild-type) proteins were localized to the cell periphery, whereas mutant proteins were not effectively trafficked to the cell membrane. Furthermore, we found a decrease in intracellular magnesium concentration in the neurons transfected with mutant NIPA2, but no effect on the survival of neurons. To understand how low intracellular magnesium resulted in hyperexcitability, we built and analyzed a computational model to simulate the effects of mutations. The model suggested that lower intracellular magnesium concentration enhanced synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) currents. This study primarily reveals that a selective magnesium transporter NIPA2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of CAE."
https://openalex.org/W2107034118,"Empirical research suggests that the cognitively able are politically more influential than the less able, by being more likely to vote and to assume leadership positions. This study asks whether this pattern matters for public policy by investigating what role a person's cognitive ability plays in determining his preferences for redistribution of income among citizens in society. To answer this question, we use a unique Swedish data set that matches responses to a tailor-made questionnaire to administrative tax records and to military enlistment records for men, with the latter containing a measure of cognitive ability. On a scale of 0 to 100 percent redistribution, a one-standard-deviation increase in cognitive ability reduces the willingness to redistribute by 5 percentage points, or by the same amount as a $35,000 increase in mean annual income. We find support for two channels mediating this economically strong and statistically significant relation. First, higher ability is associated with higher income. Second, ability is positively correlated with the view that economic success is the result of effort, rather than luck. Both these factors are, in turn, related to lower demand for redistribution."

Although they have been shown to play a role in experimental models of tuberculosis infection, their role in human tuberculosis remains unexplored.To determine the distribution of circulating Tfh cells in human TB, we measured the frequencies of Tfh cells ex vivo and following TB - antigen or polyclonal stimulation in pulmonary TB (PTB; n = 30) and latent TB (LTB; n = 20) individuals, using the markers CXCR5, PD-1 and ICOS.We found that both ex vivo and TB - antigen induced frequencies of Tfh cell subsets was significantly lower in PTB compared to LTB individuals. Similarly, antigen induced frequencies of Tfh cells expressing IL-21 was also significantly lower in PTB individuals and this was reflected in diminished circulating levels of IL-21 and IFNγ. This was not accompanied by diminished frequencies of activated or memory B cell subsets. Finally, the diminution in frequency of Tfh cells in PTB individuals was dependent on IL-10, CTLA-4 and PD-L1 in vitro.Thus, PTB is characterized by adiminution in the frequency of Tfh cell subsets."
https://openalex.org/W1993318801,"The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP, Diaphorina citri, Hemiptera: Liviidae), is the principal vector of the phloem-limited bacteria strongly associated with huanglongbing (HLB), the world's most serious disease of citrus. Host plant resistance may provide an environmentally safe and sustainable method of controlling ACP and/or HLB. Two xCitroncirus accessions (hybrids of Poncirus trifoliata and Citrus spp.), that are relatively resistant (UN-3881) or relatively susceptible (Troyer-1459) to ACP adults with regard to adult longevity, were compared in relation to ACP feeding behavior and some structural features of the leaf midrib. The settling (putative feeding/probing) sites of ACP adults on various parts of the leaf were not influenced primarily by plant accession. However, fewer ACP stylet sheaths were found in the midrib and fewer stylet sheath termini reached the vascular bundle (phloem and/or xylem) in UN-3881 compared to Troyer-1459 plants. Furthermore, in midribs of UN-3881 leaves the fibrous ring (sclerenchyma) around the phloem was significantly wider (thicker) compared to that in midribs of Troyer-1459 leaves. Our data indicate that feeding and/or probing by ACP adults into the vascular bundle is less frequent in the more resistant (UN-3881) than in the more susceptible (Troyer-1459) accessions. Our results also suggest that the thickness of the fibrous ring may be a barrier to stylet penetration into the vascular bundle, which is important for successful ACP feeding on the phloem and for transmitting HLB-associated bacteria. These results may help in the development of citrus plants resistant to ACP, which in turn could halt or slow the spread of the HLB-associated bacteria by this vector."

Factor VIIa (FVIIa) 2The abbreviations used are: FVII(a)(activated) coagulation factor VIIEGFepidermal growth factorETDelectron transfer dissociationGlaγ-carboxyglutamic acidHDXhydrogen/deuterium exchangeMSmass spectrometryTFtissue factor. is a trypsin-like serine protease found in the blood. It is formed by endo-proteolytic cleavage of zymogen factor VII (FVII), which is a single chain polypeptide. Upon damage to a blood vessel, both FVIIa and FVII are exposed to the cofactor tissue factor (TF), normally located inside or on the exterior of the blood vessel wall, and FVIIa becomes activated which triggers blood coagulation (1.Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. The coagulation cascade: initiation, maintenance, and regulation.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar). FVIIa consists of four domains; a γ-carboxyglutamic (Gla) domain, two epidermal growth factor (EGF)–like domains, and a protease domain (2.Hagen F.S. Gray C.L. O'Hara P. Grant F.J. Saari G.C. Woodbury R.G. Hart C.E. Insley M. Kisiel W. Kurachi K. Characterization of a cDNA coding for human factor VII.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 2412-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Despite the suffix “a,” FVIIa is predominantly in a zymogen-like state. FVIIa is highly cofactor-dependent and only exhibits biologically relevant enzymatic activity upon binding to TF. Compared with FVIIa, zymogen FVII was previously observed to have a crippled allosteric response to TF binding (3.Rand K.D. J⊘rgensen T.J.D. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Jensen O.N. Stennicke H.R.

(activated) coagulation factor VII epidermal growth factor electron transfer dissociation γ-carboxyglutamic acid hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry tissue factor. Similar to the activation mechanism of the trypsinogen/trypsin system, that has been extensively characterized, zymogen FVII is converted to FVIIa by endoproteolytic cleavage of a peptide bond which creates the N terminus of the protease domain. This cleavage leaves the two chains connected through an inter-domain disulfide bridge from residue Cys-135 to Cys-262. Unlike trypsin, however, free FVIIa is latent and zymogen-like and TF binding is required for initiation of the blood coagulation cascade. Like in the trypsinogen/trypsin system, the newly generated N terminus inserts into a region close to the three activation loops, termed the activation pocket, during activation (4.Fehlhammer H. Bode W. Huber R. Crystal structure of bovine trypsinogen at 1–8 A resolution. II. Crystallographic refinement, refined crystal structure and comparison with bovine trypsin.J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This insertion results in the formation of a critical salt bridge between the N-terminal Ile-16 (153 in FVIIa) and Asp-194 (343 in FVIIa) at the bottom of the active site S1 pocket and several hydrogen bonds to residues in the activation domain. The salt bridge leads to the formation of a rigid and correctly designed specificity pocket. Free FVIIa, in contrast, retains zymogen-like properties following limited proteolysis and does not spontaneously rearrange into the active form. The x-ray crystallographic structure of FVIIa bound to TF has provided invaluable structural details of the complex and the active form of FVIIa (5.Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. The crystal structure of the complex of blood coagulation factor VIIa with soluble tissue factor.Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Several structures of FVIIa in the absence of TF have also been solved, but so far, it has only been possible to crystallize FVIIa in the presence of active site inhibitors that maintain FVIIa in the active form (6.Sichler K. Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Hopfner K.P. Huber R. Bode W. Kresse G.B. Kopetzki E. Brandstetter H.

When the inhibitor benzamidine is soaked out of the active site of crystallized FVIIa, the resulting structure reveals a slightly rotated TF-binding helix and a disordered 170-loop (6.Sichler K. Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Hopfner K.P. Huber R. Bode W. Kresse G.B. Kopetzki E. Brandstetter H.

Biol. 2002; 322: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), indicating larger conformational flexibility in the absence of the inhibitor. The N terminus, however, remained buried in the activation pocket presumably because of constraints exerted by crystal packing. Hence no structural information is available for the free, zymogen-like form of FVIIa that patrols the blood prior to vascular injury. It has been shown that TF changes FVIIa and FVII structurally upon binding (3.Rand K.D. J⊘rgensen T.J.D. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Jensen O.N. Stennicke H.R.

Sensitive, high-resolution techniques are needed to detect the elusive dynamic interplay of distant sites critical for protein function. The hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) of main-chain amides is highly sensitive to dynamic changes in conformation between protein states, and report on the overall flexibility of the protein backbone and local hydrogen bonding (i.e. conformational dynamics). Mass spectrometry (MS) has evolved to be a powerful technique to measure protein HDX and thus monitor protein dynamics in solution, due to tolerance to complex protein systems, buffer composition, and low sample concentration. More recently, the integration of electron transfer dissociation (ETD) into the HDX-MS workflow has enabled the mapping of conformational changes in proteins at a spatial resolution down to individual residues (11.Rand K.D.

During HDX-ETD measurements, peptides generated from solution-phase proteolysis are further fragmented in the gas-phase by ETD, and through mass analysis of fragment ions deuterium contents can often be assigned to individual sites. Numerous studies in recent years have yielded substantial insight into the complex conformational changes governing FVIIa regulation (reviewed in Refs. 13.Persson E. Olsen O.H.

However, mechanistic details concerning allostery in the protease domain still remain unclear due to insufficient experimental structural information. Furthermore, the presence of inter-domain allostery between the protease domain and the light chain of FVIIa is disputed due to a lack of experimental evidence.

Exchange was quenched by removing aliquots of the reaction mixture and mixing with an equal volume of ice-cold quench buffer (i.e. 280 mm phosphate and 50 mm Tris(2-carboxyethylphosphine (TCEP)) resulting in a final pH of 2.5.

Mass Spectrom. 2011; 22: 1784-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). HDX-MS analyses experiments were performed on the following FVIIa states: FVIIa, TF-bound FVIIa, and FVIIa bound to a covalent active site inhibitor, FFR chloromethyl ketone. Unless noted otherwise, all HDX-MS experiments made use of deglycosylated FVIIa, referred to henceforth simply as FVIIa. Wild-type FVIIa was used only in comparative experiments described later. Proteins were diluted into D2O and the resulting mass increase due to incorporation of deuterium at the main-chain amide groups was monitored as a function of time. Deuterium incorporation was localized to various regions of FVIIa by mass analysis of peptides produced by pepsin proteolysis as described earlier (3.Rand K.D. J⊘rgensen T.J.D. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Jensen O.N. Stennicke H.R. Andersen M.D. Allosteric activation of coagulation factor VIIa visualized by hydrogen exchange.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23018-23024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this manner, a complex mixture of 48 overlapping peptides of FVIIa (Fig. 1) were identified and used to monitor hydrogen exchange of 362 out of 406 amide hydrogens (75% FVIIa light chain, 98% FVIIa heavy chain). Comparison of the HDX of unbound and TF-bound FVIIa revealed a subset of 25 representative FVIIa peptides that displayed reduced deuterium uptake upon TF binding and thus contained residues whose conformational dynamics were affected upon TF-induced activation of FVIIa (Figs. 1A and 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). These results were in general agreement with our earlier analysis of the HDX of FVIIa upon TF binding (3.Rand K.D. J⊘rgensen T.J.D. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Jensen O.N. Stennicke H.R. Andersen M.D. Allosteric activation of coagulation factor VIIa visualized by hydrogen exchange.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23018-23024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study, we targeted peptides displaying reduced HDX upon TF binding for ETD in follow-up experiments to account in more detail for the sites affected upon activation. Furthermore, we sought to optimize the sequence coverage of the FVIIa light chain, thus being able to provide for the first time a comprehensive analysis of any changes that might occur in this part of the molecule upon activation. Finally, we also measured the HDX of FVIIa when occupied by the covalent active site inhibitor FFR. The inhibitor is known to lock FVIIa in an active conformation in the absence of TF and thus provides a unique opportunity to discriminate between the direct effects of TF binding and indirect allosteric effects of the cofactor. We observed that a similar, but not identical, subset of peptides affected by TF also displayed reduced HDX upon FFR binding (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the reduction in HDX upon incorporation of the inhibitor was generally more pronounced compared with those seen upon TF binding (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). HDX-ETD experiments were performed using a data-dependent inclusion list to optimize precursor ion selection and ETD acquisition parameters for FVIIa peptides of interest. Using this HDX-ETD workflow, we generated ETD data for 7 peptides of FVIIa observed to be affected by TF. The peptides cover regions of interest including the 170-loop (peptide 316–325), activation loop 3 (peptide 371–377), the Ca2+-binding loop (peptide 209–227), strand B2 (peptide 298–305), strand D1 (peptide 201–208), and the interchain linkage region (peptide 134–141). Moreover, ETD measurements on peptide 288–296 (strand A2) were also acquired successfully, but the difference in deuterium uptake between unbound and bound state was not significant within the error margin of our measurements (data not shown.) The derived site-specific HDX information allow us to locate, for the first time, a comprehensive network of residues in FVIIa that relay a concerted allosteric signal from the TF binding site to distinct parts of the protease domain of FVIIa. These two loops are placed on rim of the active site cleft of the protease domain, with the 94-shunt forming part of the S2 site and the 170-loop bordering the S3/S4 sites. Fig. 3A displays the HDX plot for peptide 316–325, showing a reduction in deuterium uptake of the 170-loop upon TF binding (∼1D in both segment 316–325 and segment 306–316). The magnitude of this decrease is slightly less pronounced compared with the HDX-MS studies conducted earlier due to differences in the experimental setup (3.Rand K.D. J⊘rgensen T.J.D. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Jensen O.N. Stennicke H.R. Andersen M.D. Allosteric activation of coagulation factor VIIa visualized by hydrogen exchange.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23018-23024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It was also proposed previously that helix α1 (307–312) was distorted and shortened by 3 residues in free FVIIa (7.Pike A.C. Brzozowski A.M. Roberts S.M. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Structure of human factor VIIa and its implications for the triggering of blood coagulation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8925-8930Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and the current finding of stabilization in the 306–316 segment could indicate the existence of such a distortion. Fig. 3B shows the HDX-ETD data obtained for peptide 316–325 from the 170-loop in the presence and absence of TF after 15-s exchange time based on four c-ions. The results allow us to pinpoint that the hydrogen bond interactions involving amide hydrogen of residues Ile-323 and Glu-325 are destabilized in free FVIIa (Fig. 3C). Stabilization obviously anchors the 170-loop to the main body of the protease domain and echoes well with the proposal in a recent review suggesting that the stabilization of residues Ile-323 and Glu-325 could be part of step 2 of “Path I” (13.Persson E. Olsen O.H. Allosteric activation of coagulation factor VIIa.Front. Biosci. 2011; 16: 3156-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). HDX-MS data for a total of 6 peptides covering the 94-shunt were recorded. Like previously observed, only a modest reduction in deuterium uptake was observed upon binding to TF (3.Rand K.D. J⊘rgensen T.J.D. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Jensen O.N. Stennicke H.R. Andersen M.D. Allosteric activation of coagulation factor VIIa visualized by hydrogen exchange.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23018-23024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and current ETD analyses failed to sublocalize this further (data not shown). The site of N-terminal insertion in FVIIa (and other trypsin-like proteases), referred to as the activation pocket, is a cavity formed by parts of activation loops 1 and 2 and β-strands A2 and B2. In addition to both activation loops, dramatic reduction of HDX in peptides of β-strands A2 and a part of B2 was observed upon TF binding to FVIIa in our current study, (Figs. 1A and 4A) which correlates well with previous HDX-MS findings in the mentioned region (3.Rand K.D. J⊘rgensen T.J.D. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Jensen O.N. Stennicke H.R. Andersen M.D. Allosteric activation of coagulation factor VIIa visualized by hydrogen exchange.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23018-23024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Fig. 4B displays the HDX-ETD measurements performed on peptide 298–305 of the B2 strand, which allow us to pinpoint stabilized residues to be Leu-300, Val-302, Arg-304, and Leu-305. The observed allostery in this region may serve as the intermediate step 1 in an allosteric “Path II” heading toward the activation pocket described in a recent review (13.Persson E. Olsen O.H. Allosteric activation of coagulation factor VIIa.Front. Biosci. 2011; 16: 3156-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 4C, the pinpointed allosteric sites in the β-strands A2 and B2 obviously shape the secondary structure of this region while anchoring the 170-loop and activation loop 1. Specifically, main chain amides of Leu-300 and Val-302 of strand B2 form integral hydrogen bonds to the neighboring strand A in the active form of FVIIa and our HDX-ETD data show that these hydrogen bonds are significantly destabilized or even absent in the free form of FVIIa. This presumably rearranges the alignment of strands A2 and B2 with respect to each other in the free zymogen-like FVIIa. The three activation loops of trypsin-like serine proteases are situated in near proximity on one face of the protease domain, spanning the region between the active site cleft and the site of N-terminal insertion. Among 5 peptides covering activation loop 1, only a limited decrease in deuterium incorporation was observed (Dunbound − Dbound < 0.5 Da) upon TF binding. This observation was backed up by the ETD measurements performed on peptide 288–296, which confirmed that only a minor change in deuterium uptake took place. Fig. 5A revealed an average 0.6 D decrease in deuterium uptake in peptide 371–377 upon TF binding, with the effect pinpointed to residues Val-376 and Tyr-377 based on ETD readings (Fig. 5B). This indicates that the hydrogen bonds that link Val-376-Trp-364 and Phe-328-Tyr-377, respectively, are likely to be absent or destabilized in the free form of FVIIa (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, the stabilization of β-strands E2 and F2 through Val-376 seems to anchor activation loop 3, while the stabilization that includes the amide hydrogen of Tyr-377 anchors the 170-loop. Moreover, it was observed in MD and SMD simulations (20.Olsen O.H. Rand K.D. Østergaard H. Persson E.

https://openalex.org/W1991151936,"Retaining β-exoglucosidases operate by a mechanism in which the key amino acids driving the glycosidic bond hydrolysis act as catalytic acid/base and nucleophile. Recently we designed two distinct classes of fluorescent cyclophellitol-type activity-based probes (ABPs) that exploit this mechanism to covalently modify the nucleophile of retaining β-glucosidases. Whereas β-epoxide ABPs require a protonated acid/base for irreversible inhibition of retaining β-glucosidases, β-aziridine ABPs do not. Here we describe a novel sensitive method to identify both catalytic residues of retaining β-glucosidases by the combined use of cyclophellitol β-epoxide- and β-aziridine ABPs. In this approach putative catalytic residues are first substituted to noncarboxylic amino acids such as glycine or glutamine through site-directed mutagenesis. Next, the acid/base and nucleophile can be identified via classical sodium azide-mediated rescue of mutants thereof. Selective labeling with fluorescent β-aziridine but not β-epoxide ABPs identifies the acid/base residue in mutagenized enzyme, as only the β-aziridine ABP can bind in its absence. The Absence of the nucleophile abolishes any ABP labeling. We validated the method by using the retaining β-glucosidase GBA (CAZy glycosylhydrolase family GH30) and then applied it to non-homologous (putative) retaining β-glucosidases categorized in GH1 and GH116: GBA2, GBA3, and LPH. The described method is highly sensitive, requiring only femtomoles (nanograms) of ABP-labeled enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1986592212,"Establishing peripheral CD8(+) T cell tolerance is vital to avoid immune mediated destruction of healthy self-tissues. However, it also poses a major impediment to tumor immunity since tumors are derived from self-tissue and often induce T cell tolerance and dysfunction. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that regulate T cell tolerance versus immunity has important implications for human health. Signals received from the tissue environment largely dictate whether responding T cells become activated or tolerant. For example, induced expression and subsequent ligation of negative regulatory receptors on the surface of self-reactive CD8(+) T cells are integral in the induction of tolerance. We utilized a murine model of T cell tolerance to more completely define the molecules involved in this process. We discovered that, in addition to other known regulatory receptors, tolerant self-reactive CD8(+) T cells distinctly expressed the surface receptor neuropilin-1 (Nrp1). Nrp1 was highly induced in response to self-antigen, but only modestly when the same antigen was encountered under immune conditions, suggesting a possible mechanistic link to T cell tolerance. We also observed a similar Nrp1 expression profile on human tumor infiltrating CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Despite high expression on tolerant CD8(+) T cells, our studies revealed that Nrp1 had no detectable role in the tolerant phenotype. Specifically, Nrp1-deficient T cells displayed the same functional defects as wild-type self-reactive T cells, lacking in vivo cytolytic potential, IFNγ production, and antitumor responses. While reporting mostly negative data, our findings have therapeutic implications, as Nrp1 is now being targeted for human cancer therapy in clinical trials, but the precise molecular pathways and immune cells being engaged during treatment remain incompletely defined."
https://openalex.org/W1998904218,"Background This study investigated the association between statin use and herpes zoster (HZ) occurrence in a population-based case-control study. Methods Study subjects were retrieved from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000. This study included 47,359 cases with HZ and 142,077 controls. We performed conditional logistic regression analyses to calculate the odds ratio (OR) to present the association between HZ and having previously been prescribed statin. Results We found that 13.0% of the sampled subjects had used statins, at 15.5% and 12.1% for cases and controls, respectively (p<0.001). A conditional logistic regression analysis suggested that the adjusted OR of being a statin user before the index date for cases was 1.28 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24∼1.32) compared to controls. Subjects aged 18∼44 years had the highest adjusted OR for prior statin use among cases compared to controls (OR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.45∼1.92). Furthermore, we found that the ORs of being a regular and irregular statin user before the index date for cases were 1.32 (95% CI: 1.27∼1.38) and 1.23 (95% CI: 1.181.29), respectively, compared to controls. Conclusions We concluded that prior statin use was associated with HZ occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2063638859,"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a global disease affecting a large number of people. Some studies have found a relationship between low-grade inflammation and ED. We hypothesized that the immune system might play a key role in the outcome of ED. Five immune agents (C3, C4, IgA, IgM, and IgG) were collected based on the Fangchenggang Area Male Health and Examination Survey (FAMHES), using methods of a traditional cross-sectional analysis. Our results repeated the significant association between ED and metabolic syndrome, obesity, and so forth. However, there seemed to be no positive relation between the tested indexes and ED risk in the baseline analysis (C3: P = 0.737; C4: P = 0.274; IgA: P = 0.943; IgG: P = 0.069; IgM: P = 0.985). Then, after adjusting for age and multivariate covariates, a potentially significant association between ED and IgG was discovered (P = 0.025 and P = 0.034, respectively). Meanwhile, in order to describe the development of ED on a gene level, SNP–set kernel-machine association test (SKAT) was applied with the known humoral immune genes involved. The outcomes suggested that PTAFR (binary P value: 0.0096; continuous P value: 0.00869), IL27 (0.0029; 0.1954), CD37 (0.0248; 0.5196), CD40 (0.7146; 0.0413), IL7R (0.1223; 0.0222), PSMB9 (0.1237; 0.0212), and CXCR3 (0.0849; 0.0478) might be key genes in ED, especially IL27, when we restricted the family-wise error rate (FWER) to 0.5. Our study shows that IgG and seven genes (PTAFR, CD37, CD40, IL7R, PSMB9, CXCR3, and especially IL27) might be key factors in the pathogenesis of ED, which could pave the way for future gene and immune therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2022920473,"We investigated the effects of elevated pCO2 on cultures of the unicellular N2-fixing cyanobacterium Crocosphaera watsonii WH8501. Using CO2-enriched air, cultures grown in batch mode under high light intensity were exposed to initial conditions approximating current atmospheric CO2 concentrations (∼400 ppm) as well as CO2 levels corresponding to low- and high-end predictions for the year 2100 (∼750 and 1000 ppm). Following acclimation to CO2 levels, the concentrations of particulate carbon (PC), particulate nitrogen (PN), and cells were measured over the diurnal cycle for a six-day period spanning exponential and early stationary growth phases. High rates of photosynthesis and respiration resulted in biologically induced pCO2 fluctuations in all treatments. Despite this observed pCO2 variability, and consistent with previous experiments conducted under stable pCO2 conditions, we observed that elevated mean pCO2 enhanced rates of PC production, PN production, and growth. During exponential growth phase, rates of PC and PN production increased by ∼1.2- and ∼1.5-fold in the mid- and high-CO2 treatments, respectively, when compared to the low-CO2 treatment. Elevated pCO2 also enhanced PC and PN production rates during early stationary growth phase. In all treatments, PC and PN cellular content displayed a strong diurnal rhythm, with particulate C:N molar ratios reaching a high of 22∶1 in the light and a low of 5.5∶1 in the dark. The pCO2 enhancement of metabolic rates persisted despite pCO2 variability, suggesting a consistent positive response of Crocosphaera to elevated and fluctuating pCO2 conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2051338299,"Introduction Oxysterol binding protein Related Proteins (ORPs) mediate intracellular lipid transport and homeostatic regulation. ORP8 downregulates ABCA1 expression in macrophages and cellular cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I. In line, ORP8 knockout mice display increased amounts of HDL cholesterol in blood. However, the role of macrophage ORP8 in atherosclerotic lesion development is unknown. Methods and Results LDL receptor knockout (KO) mice were transplanted with bone marrow (BM) from ORP8 KO mice and C57Bl/6 wild type mice. Subsequently, the animals were challenged with a high fat/high cholesterol Western-type diet to induce atherosclerosis. After 9 weeks of Western-Type diet feeding, serum levels of VLDL cholesterol were increased by 50% in ORP8 KO BM recipients compared to the wild-type recipients. However, no differences were observed in HDL cholesterol. Despite the increase in VLDL cholesterol, lesions in mice transplanted with ORP8 KO bone marrow were 20% smaller compared to WT transplanted controls. In addition, ORP8 KO transplanted mice displayed a modest increase in the percentage of macrophages in the lesion as compared to the wild-type transplanted group. ORP8 deficient macrophages displayed decreased production of pro-inflammatory factors IL-6 and TNFα, decreased expression of differentiation markers and showed a reduced capacity to form foam cells in the peritoneal cavity. Conclusions Deletion of ORP8 in bone marrow-derived cells, including macrophages, reduces lesion progression after 9 weeks of WTD challenge, despite increased amounts of circulating pro-atherogenic VLDL. Reduced macrophage foam cell formation and lower macrophage inflammatory potential are plausible mechanisms contributing to the observed reduction in atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2111649827,"Biological invasions can strongly influence species interactions such as pollination. Most of the documented effects of exotic plant species on plant-pollinator interactions have been observational studies using single pairs of native and exotic plants, and have focused on dominant exotic plant species. We know little about how exotic plants alter interactions in entire communities of plants and pollinators, especially at low to medium invader densities. In this study, we began to address these gaps by experimentally removing the flowers of a showy invasive shrub, Rosa multiflora, and evaluating its effects on the frequency, richness, and composition of bee visitors to co-flowering native plants. We found that while R. multiflora increased plot-level richness of bee visitors to co-flowering native plant species at some sites, its presence had no significant effects on bee visitation rate, visitor richness, bee community composition, or abundance overall. In addition, we found that compared to co-flowering natives, R. multiflora was a generalist plant that primarily received visits from generalist bee species shared with native plant species. Our results suggest that exotic plants such as R. multiflora may facilitate native plant pollination in a community context by attracting a more diverse assemblage of pollinators, but have limited and idiosyncratic effects on the resident plant-pollinator network in general."
https://openalex.org/W2075663349,"The development of large-scale molecular computational networks is a promising approach to implementing logical decision making at the nanoscale, analogous to cellular signaling and regulatory cascades. DNA strands with catalytic activity (DNAzymes) are one means of systematically constructing molecular computation networks with inherent signal amplification. Linking multiple DNAzymes into a computational circuit requires the design of substrate molecules that allow a signal to be passed from one DNAzyme to another through programmed biochemical interactions. In this paper, we chronicle an iterative design process guided by biophysical and kinetic constraints on the desired reaction pathways and use the resulting substrate design to implement heterogeneous DNAzyme signaling cascades. A key aspect of our design process is the use of secondary structure in the substrate molecule to sequester a downstream effector sequence prior to cleavage by an upstream DNAzyme. Our goal was to develop a concrete substrate molecule design to achieve efficient signal propagation with maximal activation and minimal leakage. We have previously employed the resulting design to develop high-performance DNAzyme-based signaling systems with applications in pathogen detection and autonomous theranostics."
https://openalex.org/W1988369888,"In anti-cancer therapy mediated by a nanoparticle-based drug delivery system (DDS), overall efficacy depends on the release efficiency of cargos from the nanoparticles in the cancer cells as well as the specificity of delivery to tumor tissue. However, conventional liposome-based DDS have no mechanism for specifically releasing the encapsulated cargos inside the cancer cells. To overcome this barrier, we developed nanoparticles containing a novel liposomal membrane destabilization peptide (LMDP) that can destabilize membranes by cleavage with intramembranous proteases on/in cancer cells. Calcein encapsulated in liposomes modified with LMDP (LMDP-lipo) was effectively released in the presence of a membrane fraction containing an LMDP-cleavable protease. The release was inhibited by a protease inhibitor, suggesting that LMDP-lipo could effectively release its cargo into cells in response to a cancer-specific protease. Moreover, when LMDP-lipo contained fusogenic lipids, the release of cargo was accelerated, suggesting that the fusion of LMDP-lipo with cellular membranes was the initial step in the intracellular delivery. Time-lapse microscopic observations showed that the release of cargo from LMDP-lipo occurred immediately after association of LMDP-lipo with target cells. Consequently, LMDP-lipo could be a useful nanoparticle capable of effective release of cargos specifically into targeted cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2011941473,"Synthetic fingerprints are a potential threat to automatic fingerprint identification systems (AFISs). In this paper, we propose an algorithm to discriminate synthetic fingerprints from real ones. First, four typical characteristic factors-the ridge distance features, global gray features, frequency feature and Harris Corner feature-are extracted. Then, a support vector machine (SVM) is used to distinguish synthetic fingerprints from real fingerprints. The experiments demonstrate that this method can achieve a recognition accuracy rate of over 98% for two discrete synthetic fingerprint databases as well as a mixed database. Furthermore, a performance factor that can evaluate the SVM's accuracy and efficiency is presented, and a quantitative optimization strategy is established for the first time. After the optimization of our synthetic fingerprint discrimination task, the polynomial kernel with a training sample proportion of 5% is the optimized value when the minimum accuracy requirement is 95%. The radial basis function (RBF) kernel with a training sample proportion of 15% is a more suitable choice when the minimum accuracy requirement is 98%."
https://openalex.org/W2007675113,"Seamounts and their influence on the surrounding environment are currently being extensively debated but, surprisingly, scant information is available for the Mediterranean area. Furthermore, although the deep Tyrrhenian Sea is characterised by a complex bottom morphology and peculiar hydrodynamic features, which would suggest a variable influence on the benthic domain, few studies have been carried out there, especially for soft-bottom macrofaunal assemblages. In order to fill this gap, the structure of the meio-and macrofaunal assemblages of the Vercelli Seamount and the surrounding deep area (northern Tyrrhenian Sea – western Mediterranean) were studied in relation to environmental features. Sediment was collected with a box-corer from the seamount summit and flanks and at two far-field sites in spring 2009, in order to analyse the metazoan communities, the sediment texture and the sedimentary organic matter. At the summit station, the heterogeneity of the habitat, the shallowness of the site and the higher trophic supply (water column phytopigments and macroalgal detritus, for instance) supported a very rich macrofaunal community, with high abundance, biomass and diversity. In fact, its trophic features resembled those observed in coastal environments next to seagrass meadows. At the flank and far-field stations, sediment heterogeneity and depth especially influenced the meiofaunal distribution. From a trophic point of view, the low content of the valuable sedimentary proteins that was found confirmed the general oligotrophy of the Tyrrhenian Sea, and exerted a limiting influence on the abundance and biomass of the assemblages. In this scenario, the rather refractory sedimentary carbohydrates became a food source for metazoans, which increased their abundance and biomass at the stations where the hydrolytic-enzyme-mediated turnover of carbohydrates was faster, highlighting high lability."
