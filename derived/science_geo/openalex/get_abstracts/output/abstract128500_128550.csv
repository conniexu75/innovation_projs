Our group purified MCM protein complexes consisting of MCM2, -4 (Cdc21), -6 (Mis5), and -7 (CDC47) proteins from HeLa cells by using histone-Sepharose column chromatography (Ishimi, Y., Ichinose, S., Omori, A., Sato K., and Kimura, H. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 24115–24122). The present study revealed that both ATPase activity and DNA helicase activity that displaces oligonucleotides annealed to single-stranded circular DNA are associated with an MCM protein complex. Both ATPase and DNA helicase activities were co-purified with a 600-kDa protein complex that is consisted of equal amounts of MCM4, -6, and -7 proteins. An immunodepletion of the MCM protein complex from the purified fraction using anti-MCM4 antibody resulted in the severe reduction of the DNA helicase activity. Displacement of DNA fragments by the DNA helicase suggested that it migrated along single-stranded DNA in the 3′ to 5′ direction, and the DNA helicase activity was detected only in the presence of hydrolyzable ATP or dATP. These results suggest that this helicase may be involved in the initiation of DNA replication as a DNA unwinding enzyme.

In human cells, MCM4, -6, and -7 proteins form a stable complex, and MCM2 is loosely associated with this complex (12Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J.

MCM3 and -5 proteins also form a stable complex (10Kimura H. Takizawa N. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2097-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13Burkhart R. Schulte D. Hu B. Musahl C. Göhring F. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). All six of the MCM proteins contain DNA-dependent ATPase motifs in a central domain that is conserved from yeast to mammals, and these motifs are found in several enzymes that unwind the DNA duplex (17Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that MCM protein complexes may be involved in the initiation of DNA replication as an enzyme that unwinds DNA in the origin region. However, DNA helicase activity of MCM proteins has not been reported.MCM proteins bind with chromatin before the initiation of DNA replication and are then released from the chromatin as DNA replication proceeds (18Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 19Yan H. Merchant A.M. Tye B.K.

Biol. 1995; 5: 1270-1279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Our group found that MCM protein complexes containing MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 proteins bound tightly with histone H3in vitro and were purified to near homogeneity by histone-Sepharose column chromatography (21Ishimi Y. Ichinose S. Omori A. Sato K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24115-24122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the present study, it is shown that both ATPase and DNA helicase activities are associated with an MCM4, -6, and -7 protein complex.DISCUSSIONI showed that both ATPase and DNA helicase activities were present in the purified MCM protein fraction. The results of the immunodepletion experiment using anti-MCM4 antibody suggested that the DNA helicase activity required the MCM protein complexes (Fig. 2). The peak of DNA helicase activity was detected at a position of about 350 kDa in the glycerol gradient centrifugation where almost equal amounts of MCM4, -6, and -7 proteins were present, suggesting that a trimeric complex of MCM4, -6, and -7 (calculated molecular mass is 293 kDa) has the DNA helicase activity (Figs. 1 and 3). Consistently, it was suggested that MCM6 or MCM4 protein was capable of binding ATP (Fig.4). The protein cross-linking of the glycerol gradient fractions indicated that these three MCM proteins formed a hexamer of 600 kDa, and the correlation between the amount of this 600-kDa complex and the DNA helicase activity suggests that this complex functions as a DNA helicase. It is probable that MCM4, -6, and -7 proteins form a stable trimeric complex and that this complex also interacts with another trimer to form a hexameric complex. The hexameric complex may be separated into two trimeric complexes during glycerol gradient centrifugation. A main peak of MCM proteins in the glycerol gradient centrifugation (Figs. 1 and 3) was detected at a position near 230 kDa, where four MCM proteins were present. In the same position, mainly a roughly 400-kDa complex was detected (Fig. 3). These results suggest that stable dimers of MCM proteins are present in purified MCM proteins and that they interact to form tetramers of 400 kDa, but they probably do not function as a DNA helicase. Since DNA helicase activity was detected only in the fractions lacking MCM2 protein, it is possible that the presence of MCM2 protein disturbs the assembly of MCM4, -6, and -7 proteins to inhibit the DNA helicase activity.The four MCM proteins of MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 were tightly bound to a histone-Sepharose column (21Ishimi Y. Ichinose S. Omori A. Sato K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24115-24122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our group found that among these proteins, only MCM2 protein has an affinity for histone. 2Y. Ishimi, Y. Komamura, and H. Kimura, unpublished results. Therefore, I speculate that a complex consisting of MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 was bound to the histone-Sepharose column through the interaction between MCM2 and histone (histone H3), and a trimeric complex of MCM4, -6, and -7 was dissociated from MCM2 protein during the elution of the MCM proteins with sodium chloride. Knipper's group (12Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Schulte D. Richter A. Burkhart R. Musahl C. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Holthoff H.P. Hameister H. Knippers R. Genomics. 1996; 37: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) has reported that MCM4, -6, and -7 proteins form a stable complex and that MCM2 protein is more loosely associated with the trimeric form of MCM proteins. My conclusion that a hexamer of MCM4, -6, and -7 has DNA helicase activity is consistent with the findings that several helicases including SV40 T antigen (30Dean F.B. Borowiec J. Eki T. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14129-14137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) function as a hexamer (31Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 32West S.C. Cell. 1996; 86: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 33Matson S.W. Bean D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 389-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, a possibility that protein(s) bound to MCM proteins has intrinsically the DNA helicase activity cannot be ruled out.The DNA helicase activity of MCM proteins can be expected from the finding that all of these proteins have motifs that are commonly present in the proteins possessing DNA-dependent ATPase activity (17Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The DNA helicase activity may be crucial for the initiation as well as the elongation of DNA replication. MCM proteins are not located in the replication forks, since they are not co-localized with either replication proteins of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and replication protein A (human multisubunit single-stranded DNA-binding protein) or newly replicated DNA (18Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 20Madine M.A. Khoo C.-Y. Mills A.D. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Curr.

In addition, MCM proteins accumulate in chromatin at the G1 phase and detach from it as the DNA replication proceeds (18Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 20Madine M.A. Khoo C.-Y. Mills A.D. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Curr.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 927-934PubMed Google Scholar). These findings, together with our results, suggest that MCM proteins are required at an early step of the bidirectional DNA replication as an enzyme that unwinds duplex DNA in the origin region. A number of DNA helicases have been identified in eukaryotes by the activity that displaces annealed oligonucleotides (36Thömmes P. Hübscher U. Chromosoma. 1992; 101: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Matson S.W. Bean D.W. George J.W. BioEssay. 1994; 16: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Among them, a mouse DNA helicase B (38Seki M. Kohda T. Yano T. Tada S. Yanagisawa J. Eki T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and DNA2 gene product inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (39Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) are good candidates for the enzyme involved in the progression of the replication forks. The complex of MCM4, -6, and -7 proteins is different from other DNA helicases in that it cannot displace longer oligonucleotides efficiently (Fig. 9). In addition, the specific activity of DNA helicase in the glycerol gradient fraction was low compared with other DNA helicases. In vivo, phosphorylation of the MCM4, -6, and -7 protein complex may stimulate the DNA helicase activity, or other replication proteins such as replication protein A may be involved in increasing the processibility of DNA unwinding by the MCM protein complex. Another possibility is that the DNA helicase activity of MCM proteins is required only at the initial step of DNA unwinding of the origin region, and other DNA helicases take over the role of MCM proteins in the DNA unwinding.The origin recognition complex (ORC) consisting of six subunits was first identified in budding yeast as a complex that recognizes the 11-base pair consensus origin sequence (40Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that the ORC is required for DNA replication (41Bell S.P. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Science. 1993; 262: 1844-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 42Foss M. McNally F.J. Laurenson P. Rine J. Science. 1993; 262: 1838-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 43Micklem G. Rowley A. Harwood J. Nasmyth K. Diffley J. Nature. 1993; 366: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 44Loo S. Fox C.A. Rine J. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Bell S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Homologues of ORC1 (45Rowles A. Chong J.P.J. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and ORC2 (46Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) were recently identified in Xenopus, and it was shown that they are required for DNA replication in an in vitro system. A genetic interaction between ORC components and MCM proteins has been reported in S. cerevisiae (44Loo S. Fox C.A. Rine J. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Bell S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 47Li J.J. Herskowitz I. Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Therefore, MCM protein complexes may be involved in the initiation of DNA replication as a DNA unwinding enzyme by interacting with ORC. Another view is that MCM proteins may unwind nucleosomal DNA, since MCM protein complexes of MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 have a high affinity for histone H3 in vitro, which was discussed previously (21Ishimi Y. Ichinose S. Omori A. Sato K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24115-24122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The observation that hydrolyzable ATP is required for the DNA helicase activity of MCM proteins seems consistent with the finding that ATP hydrolysis is required for DNA replication in the Xenopussystem (48Chong J.P.J. Mahbubani M.H. Khoo C.-Y. Blow J.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In this system, both RLF (replication licensing factor)-B and RLF-M are required for DNA replication. RLF-M has been purified to homogeneity and consists of a complex of MCM proteins (48Chong J.P.J. Mahbubani M.H. Khoo C.-Y. Blow J.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 49Madine M.A. Khoo C.-Y. Mills A.D. Laskey R.A.

Cell. 1995; 81: 601-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that RLF-B is required for loading MCM proteins to chromatin (48Chong J.P.J. Mahbubani M.H. Khoo C.-Y. Blow J.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Coleman et al. (51Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) have reported that the binding of ORC2 and Cdc6 proteins to chromatin is required for the assembly of MCM 3 protein with chromatin, which leads to the initiation of DNA replication in the Xenopus system.In the present study, it was demonstrated that both ATPase and DNA helicase activities were associated with purified MCM proteins. Although the issue of whether these activities are intrinsic features of MCM4, -6, and -7 protein complex needs further study, this paper presents the first biochemical evidence for the view that MCM protein complexes act as a DNA unwinding enzyme in the initiation of DNA replication.

The results of the immunodepletion experiment using anti-MCM4 antibody suggested that the DNA helicase activity required the MCM protein complexes (Fig. 2). The peak of DNA helicase activity was detected at a position of about 350 kDa in the glycerol gradient centrifugation where almost equal amounts of MCM4, -6, and -7 proteins were present, suggesting that a trimeric complex of MCM4, -6, and -7 (calculated molecular mass is 293 kDa) has the DNA helicase activity (Figs. 1 and 3). Consistently, it was suggested that MCM6 or MCM4 protein was capable of binding ATP (Fig.4). The protein cross-linking of the glycerol gradient fractions indicated that these three MCM proteins formed a hexamer of 600 kDa, and the correlation between the amount of this 600-kDa complex and the DNA helicase activity suggests that this complex functions as a DNA helicase. It is probable that MCM4, -6, and -7 proteins form a stable trimeric complex and that this complex also interacts with another trimer to form a hexameric complex. The hexameric complex may be separated into two trimeric complexes during glycerol gradient centrifugation. A main peak of MCM proteins in the glycerol gradient centrifugation (Figs. 1 and 3) was detected at a position near 230 kDa, where four MCM proteins were present. In the same position, mainly a roughly 400-kDa complex was detected (Fig. 3). These results suggest that stable dimers of MCM proteins are present in purified MCM proteins and that they interact to form tetramers of 400 kDa, but they probably do not function as a DNA helicase. Since DNA helicase activity was detected only in the fractions lacking MCM2 protein, it is possible that the presence of MCM2 protein disturbs the assembly of MCM4, -6, and -7 proteins to inhibit the DNA helicase activity.The four MCM proteins of MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 were tightly bound to a histone-Sepharose column (21Ishimi Y. Ichinose S. Omori A. Sato K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24115-24122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our group found that among these proteins, only MCM2 protein has an affinity for histone. 2Y. Ishimi, Y. Komamura, and H. Kimura, unpublished results. Therefore, I speculate that a complex consisting of MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 was bound to the histone-Sepharose column through the interaction between MCM2 and histone (histone H3), and a trimeric complex of MCM4, -6, and -7 was dissociated from MCM2 protein during the elution of the MCM proteins with sodium chloride.

Genomics. 1996; 37: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) has reported that MCM4, -6, and -7 proteins form a stable complex and that MCM2 protein is more loosely associated with the trimeric form of MCM proteins. My conclusion that a hexamer of MCM4, -6, and -7 has DNA helicase activity is consistent with the findings that several helicases including SV40 T antigen (30Dean F.B. Borowiec J. Eki T. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14129-14137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) function as a hexamer (31Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 389-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, a possibility that protein(s) bound to MCM proteins has intrinsically the DNA helicase activity cannot be ruled out.The DNA helicase activity of MCM proteins can be expected from the finding that all of these proteins have motifs that are commonly present in the proteins possessing DNA-dependent ATPase activity (17Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The DNA helicase activity may be crucial for the initiation as well as the elongation of DNA replication. MCM proteins are not located in the replication forks, since they are not co-localized with either replication proteins of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and replication protein A (human multisubunit single-stranded DNA-binding protein) or newly replicated DNA (18Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 20Madine M.A. Khoo C.-Y. Mills A.D. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Curr.

In addition, MCM proteins accumulate in chromatin at the G1 phase and detach from it as the DNA replication proceeds (18Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 20Madine M.A. Khoo C.-Y. Mills A.D. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Curr.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 927-934PubMed Google Scholar). These findings, together with our results, suggest that MCM proteins are required at an early step of the bidirectional DNA replication as an enzyme that unwinds duplex DNA in the origin region. A number of DNA helicases have been identified in eukaryotes by the activity that displaces annealed oligonucleotides (36Thömmes P. Hübscher U. Chromosoma. 1992; 101: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Matson S.W. Bean D.W. George J.W. BioEssay. 1994; 16: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Among them, a mouse DNA helicase B (38Seki M. Kohda T. Yano T. Tada S. Yanagisawa J. Eki T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and DNA2 gene product inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (39Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) are good candidates for the enzyme involved in the progression of the replication forks. The complex of MCM4, -6, and -7 proteins is different from other DNA helicases in that it cannot displace longer oligonucleotides efficiently (Fig. 9). In addition, the specific activity of DNA helicase in the glycerol gradient fraction was low compared with other DNA helicases. In vivo, phosphorylation of the MCM4, -6, and -7 protein complex may stimulate the DNA helicase activity, or other replication proteins such as replication protein A may be involved in increasing the processibility of DNA unwinding by the MCM protein complex. Another possibility is that the DNA helicase activity of MCM proteins is required only at the initial step of DNA unwinding of the origin region, and other DNA helicases take over the role of MCM proteins in the DNA unwinding.The origin recognition complex (ORC) consisting of six subunits was first identified in budding yeast as a complex that recognizes the 11-base pair consensus origin sequence (40Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that the ORC is required for DNA replication (41Bell S.P. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Science. 1993; 262: 1844-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 42Foss M. McNally F.J. Laurenson P. Rine J.

Cell. 1995; 6: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Homologues of ORC1 (45Rowles A. Chong J.P.J. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and ORC2 (46Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) were recently identified in Xenopus, and it was shown that they are required for DNA replication in an in vitro system. A genetic interaction between ORC components and MCM proteins has been reported in S. cerevisiae (44Loo S. Fox C.A. Rine J. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Bell S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 47Li J.J. Herskowitz I. Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Therefore, MCM protein complexes may be involved in the initiation of DNA replication as a DNA unwinding enzyme by interacting with ORC. Another view is that MCM proteins may unwind nucleosomal DNA, since MCM protein complexes of MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 have a high affinity for histone H3 in vitro, which was discussed previously (21Ishimi Y. Ichinose S. Omori A. Sato K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24115-24122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The observation that hydrolyzable ATP is required for the DNA helicase activity of MCM proteins seems consistent with the finding that ATP hydrolysis is required for DNA replication in the Xenopussystem (48Chong J.P.J. Mahbubani M.H. Khoo C.-Y. Blow J.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In this system, both RLF (replication licensing factor)-B and RLF-M are required for DNA replication. RLF-M has been purified to homogeneity and consists of a complex of MCM proteins (48Chong J.P.J. Mahbubani M.H. Khoo C.-Y. Blow J.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 49Madine M.A. Khoo C.-Y. Mills A.D. Laskey R.A.

Cell. 1995; 81: 601-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that RLF-B is required for loading MCM proteins to chromatin (48Chong J.P.J. Mahbubani M.H. Khoo C.-Y. Blow J.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Coleman et al. (51Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) have reported that the binding of ORC2 and Cdc6 proteins to chromatin is required for the assembly of MCM 3 protein with chromatin, which leads to the initiation of DNA replication in the Xenopus system.In the present study, it was demonstrated that both ATPase and DNA helicase activities were associated with purified MCM proteins. Although the issue of whether these activities are intrinsic features of MCM4, -6, and -7 protein complex needs further study, this paper presents the first biochemical evidence for the view that MCM protein complexes act as a DNA unwinding enzyme in the initiation of DNA replication.

https://openalex.org/W2057216006,"ATP is released from most cell types and functions as an extracellular signaling molecule through activation of members of the two large families of P2X and P2Y receptors. Although three mammalian P2Y receptors have been cloned that are selectively activated by uridine nucleotides, direct demonstration of the release of cellular UTP has not been reported. Pharmacological studies of the P2Y4 receptor expressed in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells indicated that this receptor is activated by UTP but not by ATP. Mechanical stimulation of 1321N1 cells also resulted in release of a molecule that markedly activated the expressed P2Y4 receptor. This nucleotide was shown to be UTP by two means. First, high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the medium from [33P]H3PO4-loaded 1321N1 cells illustrated that mechanical stimulation resulted in a large increase in a radioactive species that co-eluted with authentic UTP. This species was degraded by incubation with the nonspecific pyrophosphohydrolase apyrase or with hexokinase and was specifically lost by incubation with the UTP-specific enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Second, a sensitive assay that quantitates UTP mass at low nanomolar concentrations was devised based on the nucleotide specificity of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Using this assay, mechanical stimulation of 1321N1 cells was shown to result in an increase of medium UTP levels from 2.6 to 36.4 pmol/106cells within 2 min. This increase was paralleled by a similar augmentation of extracellular ATP levels. A calcein-based fluorescence quenching method was utilized to confirm that none of the increases in medium nucleotide levels could be accounted for by cell lysis. Taken together, these results directly demonstrate the mechanically induced release of UTP and illustrate the efficient coupling of this release to activation of P2Y4 receptors."

Immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antibody against the polypeptide reduced both enzyme activities in equal amounts.Gel filtration analysis of purified UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase showed that the polypeptide self-associates as a dimer and as a hexamer with apparent molecular masses of 150 and 450 kDa, respectively. The hexamer was fully active for both enzyme activities, whereas the dimer catalyzed only the phosphorylation ofN-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc). Incubation of the dimer with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine led to reassembly of the fully active hexamer; maximal quantities of the hexamer were produced after incubation for 3 h.Kinetic analysis of purified hexameric and dimeric enzyme revealed significantly lower Michaelis constants (93 ± 3 to 121 ± 15 μm for ManNAc and 1.18 ± 0.13 to 1.67 ± 0.20 mm for ATP) and higher cooperativity (Hill coefficients of 1.42 ± 0.16 to 1.17 ± 0.06 for ManNAc and 1.30 ± 0.09 to 1.05 ± 0.14 for ATP) for the hexamer for both substrates of ManNAc kinase. The Michaelis constant of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase for its substrate was 11 ± 2 μm. The Hill coefficient of 0.45 ± 0.07 represents strongly negative cooperativity in substrate binding. UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase was feedback inhibited by CMP-Neu5Ac. Complete inhibition was achieved with 60 μmCMP-Neu5Ac, and highly positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient of 4.1) was found for inhibitor binding. Biosynthesis ofN-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a prominent component of glycoconjugates, is initiated by the action of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase (UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase, EC 5.1.3.14) and N-acetylmannosamine kinase (ManNAc kinase, EC 2.7.1.60). We demonstrate for the first time that the two activities are parts of one bifunctional enzyme in rat liver. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity from rat liver cytosol using salmine sulfate precipitation and chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, ATP-agarose, and Mono Q. The purification resulted in one polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa. Immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antibody against the polypeptide reduced both enzyme activities in equal amounts.

Incubation of the dimer with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine led to reassembly of the fully active hexamer; maximal quantities of the hexamer were produced after incubation for 3 h. Kinetic analysis of purified hexameric and dimeric enzyme revealed significantly lower Michaelis constants (93 ± 3 to 121 ± 15 μm for ManNAc and 1.18 ± 0.13 to 1.67 ± 0.20 mm for ATP) and higher cooperativity (Hill coefficients of 1.42 ± 0.16 to 1.17 ± 0.06 for ManNAc and 1.30 ± 0.09 to 1.05 ± 0.14 for ATP) for the hexamer for both substrates of ManNAc kinase.

N-Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) 1The abbreviations used are: Neu5Ac,N-acetylneuraminic acid; ManNAc,N-acetylmannosamine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. is an important component within the oligosaccharide residues of glycoconjugates. Neu5Ac and its activated form, CMP-Neu5Ac, are biosynthesized in rat liver by five consecutive reactions (1Warren L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier Publishing Co., Amsterdam, London1972: 1097-1126Google Scholar): UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) →N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) → ManNAc 6-phosphate → Neu5Ac 9-phosphate → Neu5Ac → CMP-Neu5Ac. UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase (UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase, EC 5.1.3.14) catalyzes the formation of ManNAc from UDP-GlcNAc (2Comb D.G. Roseman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 29: 653-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and ManNAc is phosphorylated by N-acetylmannosamine kinase (ManNAc kinase, EC 2.7.1.60) (3Gosh S. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 955-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Activities of both enzymes are found in the cytosol of liver, salivary glands, and intestinal mucosa, and the ratios of their respective specific activities are apparently the same in each tissue cytosol (4van Rinsum J. van Dijk W. Hooghwinkel G.J.M. Ferwerda W. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase (5Sommar K.M. Ellis D.B. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1966; 241: 5619-5626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) activities have previously been enriched from rat liver cytosol with different purification methods, but until now they have not been purified to homogeneity. It has been suggested that UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase is the key enzyme of Neu5Ac biosynthesis because its activity is feedback inhibited by CMP-Neu5Ac (6Kikuchi K. Tsuiki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 327: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8Kornfeld S. Kornfeld R. Neufeld E.F. O'Brien P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that the inherited disease of sialuria is due to a defect in the binding of CMP-Neu5Ac to UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase (9Weiss P. Tietze F. Gahl W.A. Seppala R. Ashwell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17635-17636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase is dramatically reduced in hepatoma cell lines in accordance with the lower secretion of plasma proteins in hepatomas (10Harms E. Kreisel W. Morris H.P. Reutter W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 32: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and ManNAc kinase are parts of one bifunctional enzyme. By purification of the enzyme to homogeneity and analysis of its oligomeric structure it is shown that a single 75-kDa polypeptide assembles as a hexamer with both enzyme activities, or as a dimer which is able only to phosphorylate ManNAc. Salmine sulfate was from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). UDP-[U-14C]GlcNAc and [1-14C]ManNAc were from ICN (Eschwege, Germany). All other chemicals were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany) and Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and ManNAc kinase activities were assayed by a modified method of Zeitler et al. (11Zeitler R. Banzer J.-P. Bauer C. Reutter W. BioMetals. 1992; 5: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In brief, the final volume of incubation mixtures was 225 μl, incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min, and reactions were stopped by addition of 350 μl of ethanol. UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase assay: 45 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 25 nCi of UDP-[14C]GlcNAc. ManNAc kinase assay: 60 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ManNAc, 50 nCi [14C]ManNAc, 20 mm ATP (disodium salt). Radiolabeled compounds were separated by paper chromatography as described earlier (11Zeitler R. Banzer J.-P. Bauer C. Reutter W. BioMetals. 1992; 5: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was determined in the presence of Ultima Gold XR (Packard; Groningen, Netherlands) in a Tri-Carb 1900 CA liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard). Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the formation of 1 μmol of product per min at 37 °C. Specific activity was expressed as milliunits per mg of protein. Female Wistar rats were perfused with 20 ml of 150 mm NaCl while the animals were under light ether anesthesia. Livers were removed and transferred to 2 volumes of homogenizing buffer containing 10 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ManNAc (buffer A), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The tissue was homogenized with an ultraturrax for 1 min at 10,000 rpm. The homogenate was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant obtained from step 1 was fractionately precipitated with 0.085% and 0.145% salmine sulfate (w/v), pH 7.0. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet after the second centrifugation was eluted with 100 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ManNAc, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant from step 2 was applied to a column (26-mm inner diameter × 50 mm) of phenyl-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). The column was washed with 60 ml of buffer A containing 20% ethylene glycol (v/v). The enzyme was eluted with 100 ml of a linear gradient of 20 to 70% ethylene glycol (v/v) in buffer A. Fractions were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing enzyme activity from step 3 were applied to a column (16-mm inner diameter × 20 mm) of ATP-agarose (Sigma). The column was washed with 30 ml of buffer A and nonspecifically bound proteins were eluted with 30 ml of buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. The enzyme was eluted with 50 ml of a linear gradient of 0 to 10 mm ATP in buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions with the highest specific enzyme activities from step 4 were applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia). The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer A and then eluted with 10 ml of a 0 to 0.6 m NaCl gradient. Fractions were collected at 0.2 ml/min. All procedures were carried out at 0–4 °C. Fractions obtained during purification were assayed for UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and ManNAc kinase activities as described above, and analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gels were silver stained for protein as described elsewhere (14Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 103-112Crossref Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody against UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase was obtained as described elsewhere (15Boulard C. Lecoisey A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 50: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 10 mg of Protein-A-Sepharose were preincubated in 10 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 (w/v), and 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) for 30 min at 25 °C. Then 10 or 20 μl of polyclonal antiserum, preimmunoserum, or (for control) H2O were added and incubated for 2 h. Sepharose was washed once with 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 (w/v), 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) and three times with 10 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl. A partially purified UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase sample from purification step 3 was made dithiothreitol-free by gel filtration as described below, with 10 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA as eluent. 300 μl of the sample (25 μg of protein) was added to the Protein-A-Sepharose and incubated for 6 h at 4 °C. Then the Sepharose was precipitated by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant was assayed for both enzyme activities. The oligomeric structure of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase was determined with purified UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase from step 5 (10 μg) by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia). For elution, buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl was used. Gel filtration was performed with samples preincubated in the absence or presence of 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc for 3 h at 0 °C. Fractions obtained at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and assayed for enzyme activities as described above, with the exception that the assay time was reduced to 15 min in order to avoid reassociation of the hexamer (see below). Dimeric enzyme was prepared by gel filtration as described above. Reassociation was performed in a mixture containing 45 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 0.2 mm NADH, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2 units of pyruvate kinase, 2 units of lactate dehydrogenase, and 1.25 μg/ml UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase. UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity was monitored at 340 nm by the oxidation of NADH. The ratio of dimer to hexamer was determined by gel filtration of aliquots withdrawn from an equivalent reassociation assay, but without pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, followed by peak integration. Kinetic data were determined separately for dimeric and hexameric UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase prepared by gel filtration as described above. Hexameric enzyme was stabilized with 0.1 mm UDP. The hexameric state was completely stable under these conditions for 6 h as tested by re-chromatography. The UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase assay contained 45 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm NADH, 2 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 2 units of pyruvate kinase, 2 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 0.25 to 0.5 μg/ml UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase, and variable amounts of UDP-GlcNAc. The ManNAc kinase assay contained 60 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, 20 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm NADH, 2 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 2 units of pyruvate kinase, 2 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 0.05 to 0.2 μg/ml UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase, and variable concentrations of ManNAc in the presence of 20 mm ATP or variable concentrations of ATP in the presence of 5 mm ManNAc. Initial velocities were determined by measuring the decrease in extinction at 340 nm. Michaelis constants (K m) were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plots, and Hill coefficients (n H) were determined by Hill plots. Inhibition of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity by CMP-Neu5Ac was determined in an assay containing 45 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm NADH, 2 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 2 units of pyruvate kinase, 2 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 0.5 μg/ml UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase, 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc, and variable concentrations of CMP-Neu5Ac. The Hill coefficient for inhibitor binding was determined as described by Levitzki and Koshland (16Levitzki A. Koshland D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The purification of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase from rat liver cytosol involved salmine sulfate precipitation, followed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose FF (Fig.1 A), affinity chromatography on ATP-agarose (Fig. 1 B), and anion exchange on Mono Q HR 5/5 (Fig. 1 C). The enzyme activities of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and ManNAc kinase were co-purified during all purification steps (Table I). The chromatograms in Fig. 1 displayed the same elution behavior for both enzyme activities. After the last purification step, SDS-PAGE showed only one polypeptide, and this had a molecular mass of 75 kDa (Fig.2). A polyclonal antibody against the 75-kDa polypeptide precipitated both enzyme activities from a partially purified fraction in apparently equal amounts (Fig.3). All these results led to the conclusion that the 75-kDa polypeptide is a bifunctional enzyme possessing both enzyme activities. Surprisingly, the ratio of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity to ManNAc kinase activity was not constant during purification (Table I), as expected for a bifunctional enzyme. The explanation for this observation is given below.Table IPurification of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinasePurification stepProteinSpecific activitiesPurification factorsYieldsUDP-GlcNAc 2-epimeraseManNAc kinaseUDP-GlcNAc 2-epimeraseManNAc kinaseUDP-GlcNAc 2-epimeraseManNAc kinasemgmilliunits/mg-fold%Cytosol5301.94.311100100Salmine sulfate5012.536.6786280Phenyl-Sepharose67116537384243ATP-agarose0.528312101492811427Mono Q0.18784114462957918 Open table in a new tab Figure 2SDS-PAGE of samples obtained during purification of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase. 150 ng of protein per lane were applied to a 10% polyacrylamide gel and silver stained.

No loss of activity was observed under these conditions for several months. Purified UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase from the ultimate purification step was used to determine the oligomeric structure of the enzyme. Gel filtration resulted in two peaks corresponding to proteins with native molecular masses of 450 and 150 kDa, respectively (Fig.4 A). SDS-PAGE of fractions obtained during chromatography demonstrated that both protein peaks contained the same 75-kDa polypeptide, associated either as a hexamer or as a dimer. The hexamer showed both enzyme activities, whereas the dimer only catalyzed the phosphorylation of ManNAc (Fig. 4). The ratio of hexamer to dimer in fractions of purification step 5 depended on the duration of the purification procedure. Fig.4 A shows the ratio after a 3-day purification with overnight storage on ice. After 5 days of storage the hexamer was completely dissociated to the dimer, whereas no further dissociation was observed if the enzyme was frozen. It was possible to stabilize the hexameric state in buffers containing 0.1 mm UDP or 0.1 mm UDP-GlcNAc, but this prevents binding of the enzyme to ATP-agarose. Dissociation of the hexamer to the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase-inactive but ManNAc kinase-active dimer over a period of some days explains the non-constant ratio of the two enzyme activities during purification. After gel filtration of freshly prepared cytosol, enzyme activities were found only in fractions corresponding to the hexamer (data not shown). The dimer reassembled to the fully active hexamer by induction with the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase-substrate, UDP-GlcNAc. Fig. 4 Bdemonstrates that the dimer reassociated to the hexamer in a dimer-hexamer mixture obtained after step 5 of the purification. The purified dimer also reassociated to the hexamer (Fig.5). The time course of hexamer assembly showed a lag phase of about 20 min. The maximal amount of hexamer was present after 3 h of incubation with UDP-GlcNAc. The presence of ManNAc and/or ATP did not influence the dimer-hexamer ratio (data not shown). In both reassociation experiments the hexamer was only partially restored. This may depend on the in vitro conditions used in the experiments or on the enzyme concentration, which may be critical for optimal reassociation (17Traut T.W. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 125-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). At a UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase concentration of 100 μg/ml, a reassociation rate of 70% was achieved (Fig. 4), whereas a concentration of 1.25 μg/ml resulted in only 37% reassociation (Fig. 5). Michaelis constants and Hill coefficients for the hexameric and the dimeric enzyme were determined for the substrates used by UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase (TableII). The data for UDP-GlcNAc could be determined only for the hexamer. For UDP-GlcNAc, theK m was 11 ± 2 mm and the Hill coefficient was 0.45 ± 0.07, corresponding to a strongly negative cooperativity for the binding of this substrate. For ManNAc and ATP it was possible to obtain data for both oligomeric states. For both substrates we found significantly lower K m values and higher Hill coefficients for the hexamer than for the dimer. This may explain the slightly higher specific ManNAc kinase activity of the hexamer (4.88 units/mg; calculated from the data of Fig. 4) compared with that of the dimer (3.85 units/mg).Table IIKinetic data of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinaseSubstrateK mn HDimerHexamerDimerHexamerμmUDP-GlcNAcND2-aND, not determined.11 ± 2ND0.45 ± 0.07ManNAc121 ± 1593 ± 31.17 ± 0.061.42 ± 0.16ATP1670 ± 2001180 ± 1301.05 ± 0.141.30 ± 0.09All values are means ± S.D. of three independent determinations.2-a ND, not determined.

Kornfeld R. Neufeld E.F. O'Brien P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In the present study we also showed that the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity of purified hexameric UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase is inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by CMP-Neu5Ac (Fig.6). Complete inhibition was achieved with 60 μm CMP-Neu5Ac. A Hill coefficient of 4.1 was found for the binding of the inhibitor. The results were in good agreement with those for the partially purified enzyme from rat liver (6Kikuchi K. Tsuiki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 327: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and for the enzyme in human fibroblasts (18Seppala R. Tietze F. Krasnewich D. Weiss P. Ashwell G. Barsh G. Thomas G.H. Packman S. Gahl W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7456-7461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ManNAc kinase activity was not influenced by CMP-Neu5Ac, either in the dimeric or the hexameric enzyme (data not shown). Biosynthesis of Neu5Ac is initiated by the action of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and ManNAc kinase. In this study we have purified a protein which occurs as a bifunctional enzyme combining both UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and ManNAc kinase activities. This finding is supported by the following results. First, during all steps of the purification procedure presented above, both enzyme activities were co-purified. Second, UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and ManNAc kinase activities show the same elution profile from phenyl-Sepharose, ATP-agarose, and Mono Q. Third, the purification resulted in a single 75-kDa polypeptide; fractions containing only this polypeptide displayed both UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and ManNAc kinase activity. Fourth, a polyclonal antibody against the 75-kDa polypeptide precipitated both enzyme activities in equal amounts. Fifth, as shown in the accompanying paper (19Stäsche R. Hinderlich S. Weise C. Effertz K. Lucka L. Moormann P. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24319-24324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the corresponding cDNA of the 75-kDa polypeptide was overexpressed in COS7 cells whereby both enzyme activities were increased proportionately. Bifunctional enzymes are rare in mammalian metabolism. Three other known bifunctional enzymes, which catalyze two subsequent steps of a metabolic pathway, are: peroxisomal 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (20Palosaari P.M. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2446-2449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), formiminotransferase/cyclo-deaminase (21Paquin J. Baugh C.M. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14925-14931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ATP sulfurylase/adenosine 5-phosphosulfate kinase (22Li H. Deyrup A. Mensch Jr., J.R. Domowicz M. Konstantinidis A.K. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29453-29459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Possible advantages conferred by the evolution of a bifunctional enzyme are: (i) the enzyme is more stable than isolated catalytic domains (23Yablonski M.J. Pasek D.A. Han B.-D. Jones M.E. Traut T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10704-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); (ii) allosteric control is possible between the two domains (17Traut T.W. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 125-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar); (iii) the two catalytic centers may interact to “channel” an intermediate (21Paquin J. Baugh C.M. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14925-14931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further investigations are necessary to determine whether any of these advantages apply to UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase. However, it may be concluded that “channeling” of intermediates is advantageous, in that ManAc is not released into the cytosol, where it would be available to aminosugar metabolism. Thus, in the cytosol ManNAc can directly be epimerized to GlcNAc byN-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase, an activity present in rat liver (24Datta A.

ManNAc, which is essential for the biosynthesis of Neu5Ac, could be converted to GlcNAc whereas ManNAc 6-phosphate is not a substrate of N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase. Gel filtration analysis of purified UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase resulted in two oligomeric structures of the enzyme, a fully active hexamer with a molecular mass of 450 kDa and a partially active dimer with a molecular mass of 150 kDa. These results are consistent with the works of Sommar and Ellis (5Sommar K.M. Ellis D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 268: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in which the native molecular mass of the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase was estimated to be in the range of 400 to 600 kDa. The two oligomeric structures can dissociate and reassociate. Association is promoted by the presence of the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase substrate, UDP-GlcNAc, whereas dissociation occurs in the absence of this substrate. Several enzymes are known in which a change in subunit assembly is accompanied by a change in enzymatic activity, thereby providing a possible mechanism for regulation (17Traut T.W. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 125-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the case of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase, the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity is influenced by a change in quaternary structure whereas the hexamer and the dimer display only slightly different specific activities of ManNAc kinase. This suggests that UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity may be regulated by the dissociation-association mechanism in accordance with the proposed key role of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase in the metabolism of Neu5Ac. However, this suggestion appears to be inconsistent with the finding that freshly prepared cytosol does not contain a dimer. As mentioned by Traut (17Traut T.W. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 125-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), most results of the dissociation-reassociation of enzymes come from in vitroexperiments wherein it is impossible to show the existence of anin vivo regulatory mechanism. Thus, it cannot be concluded from our results for UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase that UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity is really regulated by a dissociation-reassociation mechanism in vivo. Other bifunctional enzymes are known with different oligomeric structures (17Traut T.W. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 125-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 23Yablonski M.J. Pasek D.A. Han B.-D. Jones M.E. Traut T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10704-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but to our knowledge, UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase is the first reported enzyme whereby one of the oligomeric structures catalyzes both reactions, whereas an alternative oligomeric structure catalyzes only a single enzyme activity. As demonstrated by gel filtration, UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase assembles as a hexamer and as a dimer of 75-kDa subunits. Kinetic data for the enzyme confirm this observation. The binding of CMP-Neu5Ac to the enzyme occurs with positive cooperativity and a Hill coefficient of 4.1. This suggests that the oligomeric state responsible for inhibitor binding must be greater than a tetramer and is likely to be a hexamer. Hill coefficients between one and two for the binding of ManNAc and ATP, respectively, reveal that the functionally important structure for ManNAc kinase activity is dimeric, both in the hexameric and in the dimeric enzyme. On the basis of these results we assume that hexameric UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase assembles as a trimer of dimers. Only two other enzymes are known which form hexamers by the assembly of three dimers: chick embryo dCMP deaminase (17Traut T.W. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 125-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and DNA replication helicase of bacteriophage T4 (25Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase suggests further regulatory mechanisms for UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity. As observed in this and previous studies (6Kikuchi K. Tsuiki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 327: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18Seppala R. Tietze F. Krasnewich D. Weiss P. Ashwell G. Barsh G. Thomas G.H. Packman S. Gahl W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7456-7461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CMP-Neu5Ac inhibits UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity in a concentration dependent manner, the effective concentrations lying in the normal concentration range of CMP-Neu5Ac in the cytosol (10Harms E. Kreisel W. Morris H.P. Reutter W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 32: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This provides for a very sensitive regulation of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity depending on the consumption of CMP-Neu5Ac for oligosaccharide biosynthesis. The binding of UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase is regulated by a strongly negative cooperativity (n H = 0.45). It should be considered that UDP-GlcNAc is used not only for Neu5Ac biosynthesis, but also as a substrate forN-acetylglucosaminyl transferases in the biosynthesis of oligosaccharides (26Brockhausen I. Schachter H. Gabius H.-J. Gabius S. Glycosciences, Status and Perspectives. Chapman & Hall, Weinheim1997: 79-113Google Scholar). The negative cooperativity of UDP-GlcNAc binding, together with the limited synthetic rate of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase, which is largely independent of the higher substrate concentration, guarantees that the amounts of UDP-GlcNAc required for oligosaccharide biosynthesis are not diverted to sialic acid biosynthesis. Kinetic data for ManNAc kinase (K m andn H values) indicate that the higher oligomeric state results in better substrate binding. For this reason, the specific ManNAc kinase activity of the hexamer is higher than that of the dimer although the difference is too small to be physiologically significant. There is no need for the regulation of ManNAc kinase activity, because its efficiency is directly linked to UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase by the bifunctionality of the enzyme. Furthermore, it has been shown that Madin-Darby canine kidney cells fed with high amounts of ManNAc have a 6.5-fold increased CMP-Neu5Ac pool (27Fritsch M. Geilen C.C. Reutter W. J. Chromatogr. A. 1996; 727: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This indicates that Neu5Ac biosynthesis is controlled only by the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity. We thank Dr. T. A.

Receptors with intrinsic or associated tyrosine kinase activity recruit heterodimeric PI 3-kinases consisting of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110) and an 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85). We separated a PI 3-kinase that could be stimulated by the βγ subunits of G protein (Gβγ) from rat liver. The Gβγ-sensitive PI 3-kinase appeared to be a heterodimer consisting of p110β and p85 (or their related subunits). The stimulation by Gβγ was inhibited by the GDP-bound α subunit of the inhibitory GTP-binding protein. Moreover, the stimulatory action of Gβγ was markedly enhanced by the simultaneous addition of a phosphotyrosyl peptide synthesized according to the amino acid sequence of the insulin receptor substrate-1. Such enzymic properties could be observed with a recombinant p110β/p85α expressed in COS-7 cells with their cDNAs. In contrast, another heterodimeric PI 3-kinase consisting of p110α and p85 in the same rat liver, together with a recombinant p110α/p85α, was not activated by Gβγ, although their activities were stimulated by the phosphotyrosyl peptide.

The activation of PI 3-kinase results in an increase in cellular levels of d-3 phosphorylated phosphoinositides, such as PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(3,4)P 2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3. These products, however, do not serve as the substrates of phospholipase C (3Serunian L.A. Haber M.T. Fukui T. Kim J.W. Rhee S.G. Lowenstein J.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

At least two types of PI 3-kinase, in terms of mode of the activation, have been described in mammalian cells (2Fry M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 237-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). One is stimulated by membrane-bound receptors activating tyrosine kinase, whereas the other is under the direct control of the heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins. The well known former type has been structurally characterized as a heterodimer consisting of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110) and an 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85); the regulatory subunit contains one SH3 and two SH2 domains. Stimulation of tyrosine kinase receptors by extracellular signals phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues located in the YMXM motifs of their own receptors or adaptor molecules, such as insulin receptor substrate-1. These phosphorylated proteins bind to the SH2 domains of p85 and stimulate the lipid kinase activity. The stimulatory effect of these proteins can thus be mimickedin vitro by a synthetic tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide possessing the YMXM motif (9Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J.

One report showed that a partially purified PI 3-kinase, which was immunochemically distinct from p110α and not associated with p85, is activated by Gβγ (19Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Thus, a novel catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, designated as p110γ, has been cloned and shown to be activated in vitro by both the α and βγ subunits of G proteins (14Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nürnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Receptor-induced translocation of p110γ to a cytoskeletal fraction has also been reported (20Zhang J. Zhang J. Benovic J.L.

This isozyme lacks the binding site to p85 and thus does not interact with the regulatory subunit. Quite recently, Stephens et al. (15Stephens L. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F.

PI 3-kinase activity of the novel heterodimer was markedly stimulated by Gβγ but not by a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide. In contrast to these reports, two groups including us showed that Gβγ is capable of stimulating PI 3-kinase activity immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 antibodies (16Thomason P.A. James S.R. Casey P.J.

Interestingly, insulin-induced accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3in THP-1 cells was synergistically enhanced by activation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein (18Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This observation suggests the presence of an isozyme that is regulated by both phosphotyrosyl proteins and G proteins. In the present study, we have separated a PI 3-kinase responsible for such synergistic activation from rat liver and identified its structure as a heterodimer consisting of p110β and p85 (or their related catalytic subunits). The same synergistic activation was also observed in a recombinant form of p110β/p85 expressed with their cDNAs. [γ-32P]ATP,125I-labeled protein A, and 125I-labeled protein G were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Protein A-Sepharose and anti-mouse IgG-agarose resin were form Pharmacia Biotech Inc. and American Qualex, respectively. Tyrosine-phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides synthesized according to the sequence of insulin receptor substrate-1, NGDYMPMSPKS, were obtained from Kurabou Co. (Osaka, Japan). A monoclonal antibody against the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85α ([N]SH2) and a polyclonal antibody against the whole p85 (p85PAN) were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Polyclonal antibodies against p110 (α and β) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. All other reagents were from commercial sources and of analytical grade. The bovine p85α cDNA was subcloned into pcDLSRα296 eukaryotic expression vectors for transient transfection (21Tanaka S. Matsuda M. Nagata S. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Shizawa Y. Fukui Y. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1993; 84: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The bovine p110α cDNA was subcloned between the HindIII and SalI sites of the pCMV5. The pCMV5 plasmid was a gift from D. W. Russell, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The human p110β cDNA was obtained by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction with mRNA of Jurkat cells that had been treated with dibutyryl cAMP and ligated between theHindIII and SalI sites of the pCMV5. To modify the C-terminal end of p110 (α and β), the fragments in which the p110 (α and β) coding region were extended by sequences encoding amino acids ELG as a hinge region, which precedes the 11-amino acid Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDLN), followed by a stop codon. The sequences were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.6 mg/ml glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere. Transfections were performed on 40–50% confluent monolayers in 100-mm dishes for immunoprecipitation. For transient transfection, the cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 40 μl of Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) per 100-mm dish plus 1 μg of pCMV5 containing the cDNA encoding Myc tag-conjugated p110 (α or β) with 5 μg of pcDLSRα296 containing the cDNA encoding p85α per 100-mm dish. After 12 h of exposure to the transfection medium, monolayers were replaced with growth medium and incubated for 48 h. The transfected COS-7 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 400 μl of a lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.4), 75 mm NaCl, 15 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. The cell extracts, after being precleared with Sepharose 4B resin, were incubated with 9E10 (1 μg) and anti-mouse IgG-agarose resin. After the incubation, the beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer and then three more times with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl. PI 3-kinase activity in the immunocomplex was determined as described below. In some cases, proteins in the immune complex were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with the antibody against p85, p110β, or epitope tag. PI 3-kinase activity was assayed with 0.1 mm PtdIns(4,5)P 2 as described previously (17Kurosu H. Hazeki O. Kukimoto I. Honzawa S. Shibasaki M. Nakada M. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). When the effects of GTP-binding proteins were examined, GDP-bound Giα and/or Gβγ subunits were mixed and incubated on ice for 5 min before addition of the enzyme preparation. Gβγ-sensitive PI 3-kinase was purified from rat liver according to a purification protocol of Carpenter et al.(22Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B.C. Auger K.R. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. J.

Rat livers were homogenized in 2.5 volumes of a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 10 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The resultant supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol (buffer A) and loaded to a 250-ml column of DEAE-Sepharose FF, which had been equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 1,250 ml of buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–400 mm KCl in buffer A over 1,000 ml. Fractions containing Gβγ-sensitive PI 3-kinase, which had been eluted with 150 mm KCl, were pooled, concentrated to 20 ml using a Minimodule (Asahikasei Co.), and diluted with 4 volumes of 50 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.7), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol (buffer B). The mixture was then loaded on a 50-ml column of CM-Sepharose FF equilibrated with buffer B containing 50 mm KCl. The column was washed with 150 ml of buffer B containing 50 mm KCl and eluted with a linear gradient of 50–400 mm KCl in buffer B over 200 ml. Fractions containing the activity, which had been eluted with 190 mm KCl, were pooled and concentrated to 7.5 ml using the Minimodule. The concentrate was loaded to a 300-ml column of Sephacryl S-300HR, which had been equilibrated with 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 150 mmKCl (buffer C). The PI 3-kinase was eluted at a flow rate of 1.25 ml/min, and the fractions containing the activity were concentrated to 2 ml using a Centriprep-30 (Amicon). The concentrate was diluted with 10 volumes of buffer B and loaded on a 5-ml column of blue Sepharose CL-6B equilibrated with buffer B containing 25 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer B containing 25 mmNaCl and eluted with a linear gradient of 25–1000 mm NaCl in buffer B over 25 ml. The PI 3-kinase eluted with 400 mmNaCl was concentrated to 1 ml using a Centricon-30 (amicon) and diluted with 10 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol (buffer D). The mixture was loaded on a 1-ml column of Mono Q HR5/5, which had been equilibrated with buffer D containing 50 mm KCl. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer D containing 50 mm KCl and eluted with a linear gradient of 50–300 mm KCl in buffer D over 25 ml. The PI 3-kinase eluted with 170 mm KCl was pooled and concentrated to 0.2 ml using the Centricon-30. The sample was supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin before being aliquoted, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. A heterodimeric PI 3-kinase consisting of p110α/p85 was also separated from rat liver. The p110α/p85 PI 3-kinase was eluted with 160 mm KCl from the first DEAE-Sepharose column and further separated by the column chromatography of CM-Sepharose FF and Sephacryl S-300HR under the same conditions as the Gβγ-sensitive PI 3-kinase. The βγ subunits of GTP-binding proteins were purified from rat brain and stored at a concentration of 20 μm in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% CHAPS (23Kontani K. Takahashi K. Inanobe A. Ui M. Katada T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Rat recombinant Gαi-2 was purified from Escherichia coli and stored at a concentration of 20 μm in 50 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (24Nishina H. Nimota K. Kukimoto I. Maehama T. Takahashi K. Hoshino S. Kanaho Y. Katada T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). When rat liver cytoplasmic proteins were applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column and eluted with a linear gradient of KCl, there were several peaks of fractions containing PI 3-kinase activity (17Kurosu H. Hazeki O. Kukimoto I. Honzawa S. Shibasaki M. Nakada M. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the previous paper (17Kurosu H. Hazeki O. Kukimoto I. Honzawa S. Shibasaki M. Nakada M. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we have identified that a 100-kDa/46-kDa heterodimeric form of PI-3 kinase, which was not tightly retained on the column, was activated by Gβγ. In addition to this isoform, we found that PI 3-kinase, which had been eluted from the column with approximately 150 mm KCl, was also stimulated by Gβγ upon assay with PtdIns(4,5)P 2 as a substrate. The Gβγ-sensitive PI 3-kinase was further purified by means of sequential chromatography with CM-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-300/HR, blue Sepharose, and Mono Q columns. Fig. 1shows the PI 3-kinase activity eluted form the final Mono Q column. The kinase activity eluted with about 170 mm KCl (fractions 15–18) was markedly stimulated by Gβγ (closed circles), although the basal activity assayed without Gβγ was quite low (open circles). The Gβγ-sensitive PI 3-kinase fractions contained 110- and 85-kDa proteins, which were recognized with anti-p110β and p85 antibodies, respectively (Fig. 1,middle and bottom panels of theinset), and the degree of the Gβγ-stimulated activity was correlated with both protein amounts. There was, however, no protein band immunoreacted with an anti-p110α specific antibody in the Mono Q fractions (Fig. 1, top panel of theinset). We next investigated whether a signal associated with protein tyrosine phosphorylation may also regulate the kinase activity. A tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide, NGDY* MPMSPKS (Y* indicates phosphotyrosine), derived from the sequence of insulin receptor substrate-1 was used for the present kinase assay. In the chromatography on Mono Q column, the phosphotyrosyl peptide produced only a slight increase in the PI 3-kinase (data not shown, but see Figs. 2 C and3 B below). However, the combination of Gβγ with the phosphotyrosyl peptide caused marked activation of the PI 3-kinase (Fig. 1, closed triangles).Figure 3Comparison between the Gβγ-sensitive (p110β/p85) and p110α/p85 PI 3-kinases of rat liver. The Gβγ-sensitive PI 3-kinase (p110β/p85) in the Mono Q fraction and p110α/p85-rich fraction separated from the same rat liver were subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibody against p110β and p110α, respectively. A, after resolution of the immunoprecipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide), the proteins were transferred and immunoblotted (IB) with anti-p110β (left), p110α (center), or p85PAN (right) antibody. IP, immunoprecipitate.B, the samples immunoprecipitated with the anti-p110β (left) or p110α (right) antibody were assayed for the PI 3-kinase activity as the substrate of PtdIns(4,5)P 2. The assay was performed in the presence or absence of the phosphotyrosyl peptide (pY-pep., 100 μm), Gβγ (0.5 μm), and/or wortmannin (0.1 μm). Bars represent differences between duplicate determinations in a typical study.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 2 shows properties of the Mono Q PI 3-kinase, which was assayed with the various concentrations of Gβγ and the phosphotyrosyl peptide. Gβγ stimulated the kinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, regardless of whether the phosphotyrosyl peptide was included in the assay mixture; the half-maximal activation was observed with about 0.5 μmGβγ (Fig. 2 A). To confirm that the free Gβγ subunits were responsible for the kinase activation, we examined the effect of GDP-bound Gαi-2 on the Gβγ-sensitive PI 3-kinase (Fig. 2 B). As expected, the increasing concentrations of the α subunit induced the progressive inhibition of PI 3-kinase activities stimulated by Gβγ alone and Gβγ plusphosphotyrosyl peptide. Fig. 2 C shows the effect of the various concentrations of the phosphotyrosyl peptide, together with a control tyrosine-nonphosphorylated peptide, NGDYMPMSPKS. The phosphotyrosyl peptide further enhanced the Gβγ-sensitive PI 3-kinase activity, although the control peptide had no stimulatory effect on the kinase activities assayed in the presence and absence of Gβγ. The active fractions of the Mono Q column (Fig. 1) were next treated with the specific antibody against the p110β. The peptides in the immunoprecipitate were separated by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-p85 antibody. As expected, an 85-kDa peptide can be detected in the p110β immunoprecipitate. The PI 3-kinase activity in the immunoprecipitate was again found to be stimulated by Gβγ (Fig. 3 B, left panel). The further addition of the phosphopeptide to the assay mixture increased the Gβγ-stimulated activity in the immunocomplex (Fig.3 B, left panel), as is the case in the Mono Q fraction (Fig. 1). The activity in the immunocomplex was completely inhibited by the presence of PI 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin (Fig.3 B) (25Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) or LY294002 (data not shown) (26Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the Mono Q PI 3-kinase activated in a cooperative manner by Gβγ and the phosphotyrosyl peptide appeared to be a heterodimer consisting of p110β and p85 (or their related subunits). This notion is in agreement with the findings that the antibody against the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85 ([N]SH2) recognized the 85-kDa polypeptide of the Mono Q fraction and that the Gβγ-sensitive PI 3-kinase migrated as an apparent molecular mass of 220,000 on a gel filtration column (data not shown). For a comparison, another heterodimeric PI 3-kinase consisting of p110α and p85 was also separated from the same rat liver. The p110α-subtype specificity in the separated fraction was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3 A, middle andright panels). As shown in the left panel of Fig.3 A, there was no protein band cross-reacted with anti-p110β antibody in the p110α/p85 PI 3-kinase fraction. In contrast to the Mono Q fraction containing p110β/p85, Gβγ had no stimulatory effect on the PI 3-kinase activity of the p110α/p85 PI 3-kinase fraction, although its activity was certainly stimulated by the phosphotyrosyl peptide (Fig. 3 B, right panel). As expected, the p110α/p85 PI 3-kinase activity was also inhibited by wortmannin. The phosphotyrosyl peptide alone increased the activity of both p110β/p85 and p110α/p85 only slightly, but this effect can be observed reproducibly and significantly. To confirm that p110β/p85 PI 3-kinase certainly functions as the target isoform of the synergistic activation by Gβγ and the phosphotyrosyl peptide, we expressed Myc-tagged p110β/p85α and p110α/p85α in COS-7 cells with their cDNAs. As shown in theleft panel of Fig. 4, PI 3-kinase activity of the recombinant p110β/p85α was stimulated by both Gβγ and the phosphotyrosyl peptide and synergistically by the presence of the two activators. The activity of p110α/p85α was increased by the phosphotyrosyl peptide but was unaffected by Gβγ regardless of the presence or absence of the phosphotyrosyl peptide (Fig. 4, right panel). These results suggest that the Gβγ sensitivity of the heterodimer was carried by p110β. This notion is supported by a finding that a PI 3-kinase consisting of an undefined 46-kDa peptide and p110β is also stimulated by Gβγ (Ref. 17Kurosu H. Hazeki O. Kukimoto I. Honzawa S. Shibasaki M. Nakada M. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). 2H. Kurosu, O. Hazeki, and T. Katada, unpublished results. In the present study, we have separated the target PI 3-kinase of Gβγ-induced stimulation from rat liver cytosol. Immunological analysis (Figs. 1 and 3) suggested that the rat liver Gβγ-sensitive PI 3-kinase is a heterodimer consisting of p110β and p85 (or their related subunits). In fact, Gβγ could stimulate an epitope-tagged p110β/p85α PI 3-kinase, which was expressed in COS-7 cells with their cDNAs (Fig. 4, left panel). Both the purified and the recombinant p110β/p85 PI 3-kinases were stimulated not only by Gβγ but also by a synthetic phosphotyrosyl peptide (containing the YMXM motif) that binds to the SH2 domain of p85. A surprising feature of the p110β/p85 type is its synergistic activation in the presence of the two effectors. The actions of the two effectors are considered to be specific, since (i) Gβγ-induced activation could be inhibited by the GDP-bound form of Gαi-2 (Fig. 2 B) and (ii) a nonphosphorylated peptide with the same sequence had no stimulatory effect (Fig.2 C). Stephens et al. (19Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) showed that the PI 3-kinase activity distinct from the p110/p85 heterodimer was activated by Gβγ but was unaffected by a phosphotyrosyl peptide. In agreement with their results, we have observed the presence in THP-1 cells of the PI 3-kinase activity that is regulated solely by Gβγ (18Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because the fractions having these activities are reported not to contain p85, the Gβγ-sensitive activities are considered to be different from the p110β/p85 described in this study. Thus the present paper indicates that there are multiple species of Gβγ-sensitive PI 3-kinase. The possibility that the previously reported enzyme is the p110β subunit freed from p85 is unlikely because the enzyme migrates as an apparent molecular mass of 200,000 on a gel filtration column (19Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a very recent report by the same authors showed that the enzyme consisted of the p101 regulatory subunit and the γ-subtype of p110 (15Stephens L. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M.

Recent studies have revealed that a tyrosine kinase-associated PI 3-kinase plays an important role in cellular signaling mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins (27Stephens L. Eguinoa A.

Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). For examples, an increase in PI 3-kinase activity was observed in immunoprecipitated fractions with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-src-type protein tyrosine kinase antibodies upon stimulation of the G protein-coupled receptors (27Stephens L. Eguinoa A. Corey S. Jackson T. Hawkins P.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2265-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 28Ptasznik A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19969-19973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation induced by Gβγ was attenuated by the introduction of a dominant negative p85 mutant (29Hawes B.E. Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12133-12136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we previously reported in monocytic THP-1 cells that stimulation ofN-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe receptors, which activate pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, potentiated the insulin-induced and thus tyrosine kinase-mediated accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 (18Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Such synergistic activation has been observed also in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing both insulin and formyl-Met-Leu-Phe receptors. 3T. Suzuki, O. Hazeki, and T. Katada, manuscript in preparation. These results suggested that p110β/p85 PI 3-kinase is regulated in the downstream of a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein-coupled receptor. Thus, the synergistic activation of PI 3-kinase indicated in the present in vitro study may be expected to function in the intact cell systems."

Exposure to UV light causes damage to DNA primarily in the form of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and (6-4) photoproducts. These types of DNA lesions, as well as bulky adducts produced by some chemical mutagens, are processed by nucleotide excision repair (NER). 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; XP, xeroderma pigmentosum; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; FEN-1, flap endonuclease 1; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin.1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; XP, xeroderma pigmentosum; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; FEN-1, flap endonuclease 1; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin. The human genetic disorder xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is the result of defects in this DNA damage repair pathway. Symptoms of XP include extreme sensitivity to sunlight exposure and a greatly elevated risk of skin cancer. In the past few years, much progress has been made in understanding the molecular events associated with NER (1Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15915-15918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding protein XPA is involved in damage recognition. In concert with replication protein A, which binds single-stranded DNA, and helicases XPB and XPD, a ∼27–29-base oligonucleotide segment containing the lesion is excised as the result of dual incision by structure-specific endonucleases XPF-ERCC1 and XPG. The XPF-ERCC1 complex cleaves the damaged strand at a 5′ site about 23 nucleotides from the lesion, whereas XPG cleaves the strand approximately 5 nucleotides to the 3′ side of the damage. The resultant gap is filled in by the action of DNA polymerase δ or ε, and then DNA ligase seals the nick to complete repair.

Here we report domain mapping experiments to pinpoint the PCNA-binding region of FEN-1 and show that the small region responsible for activity is conserved in XPG. This domain in XPG as well as the full-length XPG protein are shown to bind to PCNA. We also provide evidence fromin vivo studies indicating that the PCNA-XPG interaction has a role in repair of UV damage. Finally, we identify a convergent evolutionary relationship between the PCNA-binding domains of the DNA damage-inducible inhibitor p21 and the repair endonuclease XPG and show that these domains compete for binding to PCNA. TheEcoRI-XhoI fragment of human FEN-1 expression plasmid pET-FCH (15Nolan J.P. Shen B. Park M.S. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11668-11676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was ligated withEcoRI/XhoI-linearized pGEX-4T-1 vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to create a plasmid that expresses a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and residues 206–380 of FEN-1. The amino acid fragments 254–363, 254–380, 290–363, 290–380, 254–328, 290–328, 328–363, and 328–380 of FEN-1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using pET-FCH as template and primer pairs F2 (5′-CCAGAATTCAAGAGCATCGAGGAGATCGTG-3′) and R2 (5′-GTGCTCGAGTTAAGATCCCTTGGGTTCTGGCTC-3′), F2 and R3 (5′-GTGCTCGAGTTATTTTCCCCTTTTAAACTTCCC-3′), F3 (5′-CCAGAATTCGACCCAGAGTCTGTGGAGCTG-3′) and R2, F3 and R3, F2 and R5 (5′-GTGCTCGAGTCACAGCCTCTTGACCCCACTG-3′), F3 and R5, F5 (5′-TGGAATTCCTGAGTAAGAGCCGCCAA-3′) and R2, and F5 and R3, respectively. The products were digested with EcoRI andXhoI and subcloned intoEcoRI/XhoI-linearized pGEX-4T-1 to make GST fusion protein expression plasmids. Expression plasmids for the production of GST fusion proteins containing FEN-1 residues 328–348 and 328–355 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the GST-FEN328–363 plasmid to convert codon 349 or 356 to a stop codon. The stop codons were introduced using the QuickChange Mutagenesis procedure (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and mutagenic primer pairs 5′-CTTCAAGGTGACCGGCTGACTCTCTTCAGCTAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTTAGCTGAAGAGAGTCAGCCGGTCACCTTGAAG-3′, 5′-TCACTCTCTTCAGCTAAGCGCTAGCAGCCAGAACCCAAGGGATCC-3′ and 5′-GGATCCCTTGGGTTCTGGCTGCTAGCGCTTAGCTGAAGAGAGTGA-3′, respectively. The latter primer pair created an NheI site to facilitate screening. Expression plasmids for the production of GST fusion proteins containing FEN-1 residues 354–380 and 363–380 were generated by ligating annealed synthetic oligonucleotides withEcoRI/XhoI-linearized pGEX-4T-1. The oligonucleotides corresponded to each strand of the FEN-1 cDNA sequence for the specified region, included the stop codon immediately after codon 380 and were flanked by EcoRI andXhoI sites. Plasmid pET-FCH produces full-length FEN-1 (amino acids 1–380) with six histidine residues appended to the C terminus (15Nolan J.P. Shen B. Park M.S. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11668-11676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The polyhistidine tag binds tightly to metal chelation affinity resin. The FEN-1 codon arginine 339 in this plasmid was replaced with either an alanine or glutamate codon by QuickChange Mutagenesis to create R339A and R339E single point mutant derivatives using mutagenic primer pairs 5′-CCAAGGCAGCACCCAGGGCGCGCTGGATGATTTCTTCAA-3′ and 5′-CCTTGAAGAAATCATCCAGCGCGCCCTGGGTGCTGCCTT-3′, 5′-CCAAGGCAGCACCCAGGGCGAGCTCGATGATTTCTTCAA-3′ and 5′-CCTTGAAGAAATCATCGAGCTCGCCCTGGGTGCTGCCTT-3′, respectively. These primer pairs created a BssHII or SacI site to facilitate screening. The second pair of mutagenic primers was also used to generate the R339E derivative of plasmid GST-FEN328–363, whose product was used in PCNA bead competition experiments. Truncated FEN-1 proteins comprising amino acids 1–328 or 1–363 with C-terminal polyhistidine tags were created by QuickChange Mutagenesis of pET-FCH to replace codon 329 or 364, respectively, with six histidine codons followed immediately by a stop codon. The mutagenic primer pairs used to create the truncated FEN-1 constructs were 5′-GCAGTGGGGTCAAGAGGCTGCACCATCACCACCATCACTAGTGCAGCACCCAGGGCCGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCGGCCCTGGGTGCTGCACTAGTGATGGTGGTGATGGTGCAGCCTCTTGACCCCACTGC-3′, 5′-AGCCAGAACCCAAGGGATCCCACCATCACCACCATCACTAGTGGGGCAGCAGGGAAGT-3′ and 5′-ACTTCCCTGCTGCCCCACTAGTGATGGTGGTGATGGTGGGATCCCTTGGGTTCTGGCT-3′. These primer pairs each created a SpeI site to facilitate screening. The amino acid 981–1009 fragment of human XPG was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with forward primer 5′-CCAGAATTCTTAAAGCAACTCGATG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTGCTCGAGTTAACGTTTAGCATCTTCTTTCTC-3 using plasmid pBSK-XPGA (16MacInnes M.A. Dickson J.A.

The EcoRI/XhoI-digested product was ligated with EcoRI/XhoI-linearized pGEX-4T-1 to create plasmid GST-XPG that expresses a fusion protein of GST and XPG981–1009. The XPG codon arginine 992 in this plasmid was replaced with either an alanine or glutamate codon by QuickChange Mutagenesis to create R992A and R992E single point mutant derivatives using mutagenic primer pairs 5′-GCCCAGCAGACACAGCTCGCGATTGATTCCTTCTTTAGATTAG-3′ and 5′-CTAATCTAAAGAAGGAATCAATCGCGAGCTGTGTCTGCTGGGC-3′, 5′-GCCCAGCAGACACAGCTCGAGATTGATTCCTTCTTTAGATTAG-3′ and 5′-CTAATCTAAAGAAGGAATCAATCTCGAGCTGTGTCTGCTGGGC-3′, respectively. These primer pairs created an NruI or XhoI site to facilitate screening. Human PCNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with forward primer 5′-GGAATTCATGAGTCACCACCACCACCACCACATGTTCGAGGCGCGCCTGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTGCGAAGCTTACTCGAGAGATCCTTCTTCATCCTCG-3′ using plasmid kindly provided by Dr. Suk-Hee Lee (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) as template. TheAflIII/HindIII-digested product was ligated toNcoI/HindIII-linearized pET28b (Novagen, Madison, WI) to produce a subcloning intermediate. The first three nucleotides of a C-terminal XhoI site (introduced to facilitate generation of tagged variants of PCNA for other experiments) were converted to a stop codon by QuickChange mutagenesis with primers 5′-ATCGAGGATGAAGAAGGATCTTAGGAGTCAGCTTGCGGCCGCACTCGA-3′ and 5′-TCGAGTGCGGCCGCAAGCTGACTCCTAAGATCCTTCTTCATCCTCGAT-3′. This primer pair destroyed a HindIII site to facilitate screening. The resulting plasmid contained a stop codon in the naturally occurring position and directed high level inducible expression of wild-type human PCNA without tags or extensions. All subcloning and site-directed mutagenesis procedures were confirmed by DNA sequencing. BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli was used as the host strain to express PCNA, polyhistidine-tagged FEN-1 and derivatives, and all GST fusion proteins. Expression was induced with 0.8 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were lysed in wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, for FEN-1 and its derivatives and 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mmKH2PO4/K2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, for GST-XPG and its derivatives) supplemented with 2 mm EDTA and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme at a ratio of 1 ml/25-ml culture. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g. For GST fusion protein binding assays, 80 μl of 40% glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) was mixed with 450 μl of GST fusion protein cell lysate and 450 μl of PCNA cell lysate. The same procedure was used for polyhistidine-tagged protein binding assays, except that 80 μl of 40% NiSO4-charged iminodiacetic acid metal chelation resin (HisBind; Novagen) replaced glutathione-agarose beads, EDTA was omitted from lysis and wash buffers, and 60 mm imidazole was added to the wash buffer. Mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed six times with 0.8 ml of wash buffer. Protein complexes were eluted by heating to 100 °C with 80 μl of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar) and analyzed on 12% gels by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Coomassie Blue staining using Mark12 (Novex, San Diego, CA) molecular weight standards. In the first competition experiment, 0.24 mg of synthetic peptide LKQLDAQQTQLRIDSFFRLAQQEKEDAKR (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL), corresponding to residues 981–1009 of XPG, was added to one of the lysate mixtures. In this set of assays, NaCl concentration was 300 mm, 150 μl of each lysate was used, and 150 μl of wash buffer was added to increase the volume to improve mixing. In the salt dependence experiment, low salt wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 60 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) plus 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme was used for lysis, and low salt wash buffer supplemented as indicated was used for subsequent binding and washing steps. In the second competition experiment, XPG981–1009 peptide or biotinylated synthetic peptide GRKRRQTSMTDFYHSKRRLIFS corresponding to residues 139–160 of human p21 (kindly provided by Dr. Jerard Hurwitz, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) was added to lysate mixtures at the concentrations indicated. GST-XPG981–1009, GST-XPG981–1009(R992E), GST-FEN328–363, and GST-FEN328–363 (R339E) proteins used in competition experiments were purified by glutathione-agarose chromatography. Human PCNA was purified from bacterial lysate by QSepharose, S-300 Sephacryl gel filtration, and Phenyl-Superose chromatography (19Fein K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a Bradford-based assay (Bio-Rad) and verified by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels. Purified human PCNA or protease-free bovine serum albumin (BSA; Boehringer Mannheim) at 4 mg/ml in 25 mm NaHCO3, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.3, was added to cyanogen bromide-activated agarose beads (Sigma) and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C to covalently attach the proteins to the beads. Coupling efficiency was 80% or higher for each protein. Unbound protein was removed, and then remaining reactive sites were blocked with 0.1 m glycine, 65 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. Washed beads were stored on ice. Human XPG was expressed from recombinant baculovirus as described previously (17Cloud K.G. Shen B. Strniste G.F. Park M.S. Mutat. Res. 1995; 347: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), except that Trichoplusia ni (BTI-TN-5B1-4) insect cells (“High Five” cells, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) were used as the host. Cells were infected with XPG recombinant baculovirus and collected at 35.5 h post-infection. The cell pellet from 50 ml of culture was lysed in 4 ml of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mmpotassium phosphate, 300 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4. After lysis, an equal volume of the same buffer without detergent was added, reducing the final concentration of Nonidet P-40 to 0.25%. The lysate was centrifuged at 90,000 ×g, and the supernatant was 0.45 μm filtered. For binding assays, 80 μl of 20% PCNA or BSA beads was mixed with 430 μl of XPG-containing insect cell supernatant. In competition experiments, 0.4 mg of purified BSA, PCNA, GST-XPG981–1009, GST-XPG981–1009(R992E), GST-FEN328–363, or GST-FEN328–363(R339E) was added to the lysate mixture. The mixtures were incubated for 2.5 h at 4 °C and then washed five times with 0.8 ml of 100 mmKH2PO4/K2HPO4, 300 mm KCl, pH 7.4. In some experiments, a DNase I treatment was performed between the third and fourth washes. Noncovalently bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, resolved on 4–12% polyacrylamide gradient gels, and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA) polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for Western blot analysis. The membrane was sequentially incubated with 10% nonfat dry milk, 1:2000 rabbit polyclonal XPG1322 (IgG fraction) raised against an XPG amino acid 1147–1163 peptide (20Knauf J.A. Pendergrass S.H.

PCNA affinity beads were incubated with insect cell lysate and washed three times. 10 mmMgCl2 and 0 or 250 units of DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) were added to the washed beads. The beads were incubated for 20 min at 10 °C and were mixed periodically to keep the beads in suspension. After two more washes, proteins were eluted and analyzed. To confirm the activity of DNase I under the conditions used,HindIII-digested Lambda DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) and DNase I were added at various ratios to washed beads and incubated as described. These confirmatory reactions were terminated by addition of 25 mm EDTA and 0.5% SDS, and the DNA was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The repair assay using UV-damaged luciferase reporter plasmid has been described previously (22Ludwig D.L. Mudgett J.S. Park M.S. Perez-Castro A.V. MacInnes M.A. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, luciferase expression plasmid pGL-2 (Promega, Madison, WI) was irradiated with 0, 400, or 800 J/m2 of 254-nm UV light from a calibrated source. XPG function was provided by pBactin-XPG, a mammalian expression plasmid containing human XPG cDNA under the control of a β-actin promoter. A truncated derivative of this plasmid was created by BamHI digestion to remove amino acids 948–1186 of the XPG coding region and a downstream polyadenylation signal and then recircularizing the vector fragment. R992A and R992E mutations were generated in pBSK-XPGA using mutagenic primers as described for bacterial expression plasmids. These mutations were introduced into pBactin-XPG by swappingEcoRV-KpnI fragments between plasmids. XPG plasmid concentrations were determined by measurement of absorbance at 260 nm and verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The XPG-deficient CHO cell line UV135 (16MacInnes M.A. Dickson J.A. Hernandez R.R. Learmonth D. Lin G.Y. Mudgett J.S. Park M.S. Schauer S. Reynolds R.J. Strniste G.F. Yu J.Y. Mol. Cell.

Mutagenesis. 1989; 4: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was transfected with a mixture of 150 ng of luciferase plasmid, 150 ng of β-galactosidase plasmid (22Ludwig D.L. Mudgett J.S. Park M.S. Perez-Castro A.V. MacInnes M.A. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and 30 ng of wild-type or mutant XPG plasmid by calcium phosphate precipitation (16MacInnes M.A. Dickson J.A. Hernandez R.R. Learmonth D. Lin G.Y. Mudgett J.S. Park M.S. Schauer S. Reynolds R.J. Strniste G.F. Yu J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6393-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For each XPG transfection set, three to six 60-mm dishes were used. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection for analysis of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity (22Ludwig D.L. Mudgett J.S. Park M.S. Perez-Castro A.V. MacInnes M.A. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Activity assays were performed in duplicate, and the values were averaged. For each transfection, the luciferase activity was divided by the corresponding β-galactosidase activity to give relative luciferase activity, a measure of DNA repair that is normalized for transfection efficiency. Statistical analyses of the data were performed using Microsoft Excel version 4. We produced a series of GST fusion proteins that contain various regions of human FEN-1 and assayed their PCNA binding activity using a “pull-down” affinity bead interaction assay (Fig. 1). The binding activity was contained entirely within amino acids 328–355 of FEN-1. All fusion proteins that contained this region bound to PCNA, whereas none of the proteins tested that lacked the complete 28 amino acid sequence displayed binding activity. For example, the fusion protein containing only residues 328–348 of FEN-1 did not bind PCNA. It has been reported previously that the PCNA-binding domain of human FEN-1 is contained within residues 307–380 and that residues 364–380 are essential for PCNA binding (12Chen J. Chen S. Saha P. Dutta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11597-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The former conclusion is consistent with the observations reported here, but the latter conclusion is not. Because we observed no requirement for 364–380 in our domain mapping studies, we generated truncated FEN-1 proteins to address the importance of this region in more detail (Fig.2). Deletion of the PCNA-binding region to give a truncated form of FEN-1 comprising only amino acids 1–328 abolished PCNA binding activity. However, a truncated FEN-1 comprising amino acids 1–363 bound PCNA as effectively as full-length FEN-1 (amino acids 1–380). Thus, we conclude that the C-terminal region from residues 364 to 380 of FEN-1 is not essential for PCNA binding activity and in fact makes little if any contribution to this activity. This contrasts with the previous report that truncated FEN-1 (amino acids 1–363) is unable to bind to PCNA in gel filtration and affinity bead pull-down assays (12Chen J. Chen S. Saha P. Dutta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11597-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The reason for the difference between those observations and our own is not apparent. We next sought to identify specific residues of FEN-1 that are most important for interaction with PCNA. Arginine 339 of FEN-1, lying within the PCNA-binding region, was found to be crucial for PCNA binding activity. Single point mutagenesis of FEN-1 to convert Arg339 to either alanine or glutamate dramatically decreased the ability of the protein to bind PCNA, showing the importance of this region of FEN-1 and of this residue in particular. Although PCNA binding activity of the R339A and R339E mutants of FEN-1 was severely impaired, each mutant retained endonuclease activity as determined by rapid kinetic flow cytometry (15Nolan J.P. Shen B. Park M.S. Sklar L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11668-11676Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9173-9176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using a fluoresceinated 5′-flap DNA substrate (data not shown). The amino acid sequence of the PCNA-binding region of FEN-1 is significantly conserved in XPG (Fig. 3). We sought to determine whether the function of this region is conserved in XPG as well. We made a GST fusion protein (GST-XPG) containing the 29-amino acid sequence of human XPG (residues 981–1009) that is homologous to the PCNA-binding region of FEN-1. GST-XPG bound human PCNA very efficiently when bacterial lysates containing these proteins were mixed (Fig.4). GST alone lacking XPG sequence had no observable affinity for PCNA. The association of GST-XPG and PCNA was blocked by the addition of XPG981–1009 peptide as competitor, confirming that the XPG moiety of the fusion protein was responsible for the binding. XPG and FEN-1 share a conserved arginine (Arg992 in XPG) that was shown by mutagenesis to be important for PCNA binding activity in FEN-1 (Fig. 2). Replacing this arginine in GST-XPG with alanine or glutamate caused almost total loss of PCNA binding activity. The dramatic decrease in bound PCNA resulting from a single amino acid substitution in GST-XPG attests to the specificity of this assay.Figure 4XPG amino acids 981–1009 bind PCNA, and conserved arginine 992 is essential for this activity.Coomassie-stained gel of protein complexes bound to glutathione-agarose beads in pull-down binding assay. Beads were mixed with lysate from bacteria expressing GST (lane 1), GST fusion protein containing residues 981–1009 of human XPG (lanes 2–4), GST-XPG981–1009 fusion with single point mutation R992A (lane 5), or GST-XPG981–1009 fusion with single point mutation R992E (lane 6). Lysate from bacteria expressing human PCNA was added to each assay, and synthetic peptide corresponding to the XPG981–1009 29-mer was added to the assay shown in lane 3. After washing, protein complexes were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Three times as much fusion protein and PCNA lysate was used in the assays shown in lanes 4–6 as in those shown in lanes 1–3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The PCNA-binding domain of FEN-1 displayed robust binding activity under all conditions tested; however, the binding activity of the corresponding region of XPG exhibited profound salt dependence (Fig.5). Binding of GST-XPG and PCNA was almost undetectable in a buffer containing 60 mm NaCl. Adding 100 mm potassium phosphate to this buffer produced maximal binding, and adding 25 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, or 300 mm KCl increased binding to about 25, 25, and 100% of maximum, respectively. Thus, divalent anion was especially effective in aiding binding. In contrast to the behavior of GST-XPG, GST-FEN (residues 328–355) displayed nearly maximal binding in any of these buffers. Varying pH from 6.0 to 8.0 had little effect on the association of GST-XPG and PCNA, and this complex was stable to repeated washing with either 1% Nonidet P-40 detergent or 1.0 m NaCl (data not shown). An affinity bead assay was used to evaluate the interaction of PCNA and full-length XPG. Purified human PCNA was covalently attached to beads. Human XPG was expressed in insect cells that had been infected with a recombinant baculovirus strain that contains XPG cDNA (17Cloud K.G. Shen B. Strniste G.F. Park M.S. Mutat. Res. 1995; 347: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). XPG present in baculovirus-infected cell lysates bound to PCNA beads but not to control beads made with BSA (Fig.6 A). The specificity of the PCNA-XPG interaction was further demonstrated in competition experiments. The binding of XPG to PCNA beads was blocked by the addition of free PCNA to the lysate but was unaffected by addition of BSA (Fig. 6 B). Binding was also inhibited by the addition of GST-XPG981–1009, the fusion protein containing the PCNA-binding fragment of XPG. However, the R992E derivative of this fusion protein, which lacks PCNA binding activity (Fig. 4), was unable to compete with XPG for binding to the beads. Similarly, GST-FEN328–363, but not the R339E mutant of GST-FEN328–363, competed with XPG for binding to the PCNA beads. It appe"

Although these fragments are the principal PS1 species found in normal mammalian brain, the role of endoproteolysis in the maturation of PS1 has been unclear. The present study, which uses stably transfected mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells, demonstrates that full-length polypeptides, derived from either wild-type or A246E FAD-mutant human (hu) PS1, are relatively short-lived (t½ 1.5 h) proteins that give rise to the N- and C-terminal PS1 fragments, which are more stable (t½ ∼ 24 h). N-terminal fragments, generated artificially by engineering a stop codon at amino acid 306 (PS1–306) of wild-type huPS1, were short-lived, whereas an FAD-linked variant that lacked exon 9 (ΔE9) and was not endoproteolytically cleaved exhibited a long half-life. These observations suggest that endoproteolytic cleavage and stability are not linked, leading us to propose a model in which wild-type full-length huPS1 molecules are first stabilized then subsequently endoproteolytically cleaved to generate the N- and C-terminal fragments.

Thus, it has been difficult to resolve whether function is provided by full-length PS1 or the endoproteolytic fragments. Previous studies of multiple lines of transgenic mice expressing wild-type human (hu) PS1 indicate that the synthesis/accumulation of PS1 NTFs and CTFs is highly regulated; the levels of full-length PS1 increase in parallel with the levels of transgene-derived huPS1 mRNA, but the levels of huPS1 NTFs and CTFs plateau (9Thinakaran G.

Moreover, in animals expressing high levels of huPS1, the levels of endogenous mouse NTFs and CTFs fall below the threshold of detection (9Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L.

These data suggest that the absolute levels of PS1 NTF and CTF in cells is highly regulated, such that the overproduction of human fragments inhibits the synthesis/accumulation of the mouse fragments. In the present study, we generated mouse neuroblastoma N2a cell lines that harbor wild-type and FAD-mutant huPS1 cDNA genes under the transcriptional control of a butyrate-inducible cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Using this system, we demonstrate that the processed 27 and 17 kDa derivatives of huPS1 are far more stable than full-length polypeptides, indicating that endoproteolysis is a step in the maturation of full-length wild-type PS1 precursors into stable molecules. Because we did not observe short-lived pools of PS1 proteolytic fragments, it is likely that endoproteolysis occurs after the full-length protein has been targeted for stabilization. Consistent with this idea was the finding that recombinant polypeptides, engineered to terminate near the site of endoproteolysis at residue 306, were short-lived. However, and interestingly, the noncleavable ΔE9 huPS1 variant was capable of being stabilized, suggesting that endoproteolytic cleavage is not an obligatory step in maturation. These new observations, taken together with our previous studies, lead us to conclude that newly synthesized wild-type PS1 is first stabilized (probably via interactions with limiting cellular proteins), and then endoproteolytically cleaved into two long-lived fragments. In our view, the more stable endoproteolytic derivatives are likely to represent the fully mature, functional, forms of PS1. The cDNAs encoding wild-type, A246E, and exon 9 deleted (ΔE9) mutant huPS1 were generated as described (17Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. Lee M.K. Sisodia S.S. Int. J. Exp. Clin.

To generate the truncated PS1306Δ variant, sequences encompassing residues 146–306 of wild-type huPS1 cDNA were amplified by PCR using the primer pair hAD3-F146-S (GGATCCATTGTTGTCATGACTATC) and hPS1-R307stop-AS (CGGGATCCCTCGAGCTATTGAGCTTCCGGGTC). The antisense primer hPS1-R307stop-AS also encoded a BamHI restriction endonuclease site. The PCR product was digested with PflMI and BamHI, gel-purified, and ligated with anAsp718-PflMI fragment of wild-type huPS1 cDNA and Asp718-BamHI-digested pCB6 expression plasmid, which encodes the gene conferring resistance to the neomycin analog G418 (19Brewer C.B.

Mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells were maintained in 1:1 OptiMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Stable N2a cells expressing wild-type and mutant huPS1 were generated by transfecting 0.1 μg of pCB6-PS1 expression plasmids, encoding wild-type, A246E, ΔE9, and PS1306Δ, followed by selection in G418 (400 μg/ml). The level of huPS1 expression in isolated colonies was determined following induction for 24 and 48 h with 10 mm butyrate (21Lo A.C.Y. Haass C. Wagner S.L. Teplow D.B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

Four separate cell lines expressing wild-type huPS1 (WT-7, WT-9, WT-15, and WT-18), two cell lines expressing A246E (A246E-25 and A246E-26), one cell line expressing ΔE9, and one cell line expressing PS1306Δ were used in these studies to demonstrate, in part, that the observations were consistent among different cell lines. Total RNA was isolated from cells by extraction in Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) and quantified by spectrophotometry. For Northern blotting studies, 7.5 μg of total RNA was fractionated on agarose gels containing 2.2m formaldehyde, stained with ethidium bromide, photographed, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Following hybridization at 65 °C for 14–16 h with a random-primed32P-labeled huPS1 cDNA in 0.5 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 7% SDS, membranes were washed at 50 °C in 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 30 min, then exposed to film. Levels of PS1 mRNA in stably transfected N2a cells following butyrate induction were assayed by PCR of reverse-transcribed RNA (RT-PCR). Degenerate primers, capable of hybridizing to human and mouse PS1 mRNA, were used to amplify a 351-bp fragment PS1 that encompasses amino acids 290–407 (sense primer, CCTCAACAATGGTGTGGTTG; antisense primer, GGTTGTGTTCCAGTCTCCAC). The resulting PCR product was digested with AvaI, which recognizes a site present only in mouse cDNA, generating two fragments of 199 and 152 base pairs. To confirm that hyperexpression of huPS1 does not affect the level of mouse PS1 mRNA, we also PCR-amplified reverse-transcribed RNA with primers (sense, GCGAATTCACTATTGGACTTTGGAAGG; antisense, CCGGATCCTTAGAGAGTTCACAGTGC) that specifically amplify a 300-bp sequence in the 3′-untranslated region of mouse PS1 cDNA. As a control for RNA loading, we also RT-PCR-amplified a 400-bp region of mouse APP (sense, CCGGGATCCGAGCAGAACTACTCCGAC; antisense, CCGGAATTCGTTCGAACCCACATCTTC).

We initially identified cell lines that showed marked induction of human wild-type and A246E mutant PS1 after 24- and 48-h incubations in 10 mm butyrate (Fig.1). Analyses of the mRNA levels in selected cell lines demonstrated remarkable increases in the levels of huPS1 mRNA after butyrate induction (Fig. 1 A, comparelanes 3 and 4). Notably, the levels of endogenous PS1 mRNA were not affected by butyrate treatment (Fig.1 A, compare lanes 1 and 2). In parallel with increased mRNA expression after butyrate, immunoblots with PS1Loop antiserum, which is specific for epitopes in the loop domain of PS1 (9Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K.

Butyrate treatment of untransfected cells did not change the levels of full-length endogenous PS1 polypeptides or the levels of endogenous NTFs and CTFs (data not shown). To examine the kinetics of butyrate-induced expression of full-length huPS1 and proteolytic processing, cells were induced for varied intervals followed by detergent lysis, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting (Fig. 2). huCTFs migrate slightly slower than murine CTFs, whereas huNTFs migrate slightly faster than the murine equivalent (9Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N. Copeland N. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S.

In cells expressing either wild-type or A246E huPS1, full-length huPS1 polypeptides as well as NTFs and CTFs were first detectable at 6–10 h post-induction (Figs. 2, A andB, lanes 3,4,10, and11). By 24 h post-induction, the levels of both wild-type and mutant full-length huPS1, and proteolytic derivatives, began to plateau, with no further increase observed after 48–80 h of induction (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 5,6,12, and13). Immunoblots with Ab14 (Fig. 2 B), which is specific for a shared mouse/human epitope between amino acids 3 and 15 of PS1 (9Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G.

Although the observed increase in huCTFs after induction appears much more robust (Fig. 2 A), the PS1Loop antiserum binds huCTFs 2.3 times more avidly than the murine CTF (9Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N. Copeland N. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S.

Thus, relative to uninduced huPS1-N2a cells, the total steady-state levels of proteolytically processed fragments increased by only 2–3-fold after butyrate induction, whereas the levels of full-length protein increased dramatically. These data are entirely consistent with our earlier analysis of huPS1 expression in the brains of transgenic mice, where we demonstrated a highly regulated, saturable, accumulation of huNTF and huCTF (9Thinakaran G.

To examine the relative stabilities of the full-length polypeptide versus proteolytic derivatives, we employed two complementary strategies. First, we examined the decay of full-length PS1, over a 6-h interval, following 24 h of butyrate induction and blockade of protein synthesis with cycloheximide (Fig. 3, A and B). Immunoblots of lysates from cells expressing both wild-type and mutant PS1 revealed that the levels of full-length polypeptide decline relatively rapidly (within 2 h) after cyclohexamide addition (Fig.3, A and B, lane 4). From multiple immunoblots developed with 125I-labeled protein A and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis, we estimate that the half-life of both wild-type and A246E mutant, full-length, polypeptides in these cells is ∼1.5 h (data not shown). Similar data for full-length PS1 have been obtained by metabolic radiolabeling studies of transfected cells and immunoprecipitation of PS1 (12Podlisny M.B. Citron M. Amarante P. Sherrington R. Xia W. Zhang J. Diehl T. Levesque G. Fraser P. Haass C. Koo E.H.M. Seubert P. St. George-Hyslop P. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 3: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Likewise, using strategies very similar to those used here, Kim et al. (23Kim T.-W. Pettingell W.H. Hallmark O.G. Moir R.D. Wasco W. Tanzi R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11006-11010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the endoproteolytic fragments of PS2 are much more long-lived than full-length precursor protein. Notably, a short-lived pool of CTFs was not observed as the levels of CTF were unchanged over the 6-h incubation period in cyclohexamide. To examine huPS1 metabolism over much longer intervals, we adopted a second strategy, which was to transiently induce huPS1 expression with butyrate then chase in standard medium. Ten-hour butyrate inductions markedly increased the levels of full-length huPS1 and CTFs (Fig.4, lanes 3 and 8). Upon withdrawal of butyrate and subsequent incubation for 15 h, the levels of full-length huPS1 declined dramatically, whereas the levels of both wild-type and mutant 17-kDa huPS1 CTF were unchanged (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 9). These data suggested that the endoproteolytically processed CTFs are much longer lived than full-length polypeptide. To further examine the half-life of wild-type CTFs, cells were incubated in medium containing butyrate for 48 h, then “chased” in standard culture medium for 20-, 32-, 44-, 56-, and 68-h intervals. Initially, we examined the steady-state levels of huPS1 mRNA by RT-PCR analysis to determine when transcription returns to basal levels following butyrate withdrawal. Approximately 20 h after the removal of butyric acid, the levels of transgene mRNA fell to pre-induction levels (Fig.5 B); thus, between 20 and 68 h post-induction, changes in the levels of CTFs reflect, in a large part, the half-life of the polypeptide. By examining the rate of decline in C-terminal fragments over this interval, we estimated that the half-life of the wild-type C-terminal fragment is ∼24 h. The CTF derived from A246E mutant PS1 appeared to possess a similar half-life (data not shown). Similarly, the NTFs of wild-type and A246E mutant PS1 exhibited half-lives of ∼24 h (see Fig. 7 for wild-type NTFs; data on mutant NTFs are not shown).Figure 7Recombinant PS1 N-terminal fragments are not stabilized. Stable N2a cells expressing wild-type huPS1 (cell line 18) and truncated huPS1306Δ (cell line 14) were induced with butyrate for 48 h and then chased in standard medium for the indicated intervals. A and B, detergent lysates (40 μg of total protein) were analyzed by immunoblot with the monoclonal antibody N-term. C, the blot shown inA was reprobed (without stripping) with a combination of Ab14 and αPS1Loop antiserum.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). RT-PCR amplification of human and mouse mRNA with degenerate primers suggested that the steady-state levels of mouse PS1 mRNA might be diminished by butyrate induction (Fig.5 B). To determine whether the induction of PS1 transgene expression altered the steady-state levels of endogenous murine PS1 mRNA, we performed RT-PCR analysis of mouse PS1 mRNA levels with primers complementary to unique sequences in the 3′-untranslated region. Relative to APP mRNA, the levels of murine PS1 mRNA were unchanged throughout the course of induction with butyrate (Fig.5 C). These data, in conjunction with Northern blot analyses (see Fig. 1 A), indicate that the apparent loss of mouse PS1 mRNA in Fig. 5 B is an artifact of the high level of huPS1 mRNA template in the induced cells; the actual level of mouse PS1 mRNA is unchanged by butyrate induction. Thus, the “replacement” of endogenous NTFs and CTFs by huPS1 fragments appears to involve post-transcriptional processes. Previous studies have demonstrated that the FAD variant that lacks exon 9 (ΔE9 PS1) possesses normal function (5Levitan D. Doyle T.G. Brousseau D. Lee M.K. Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H. Sisodia S.S.

Med. 1997; 3: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we observed that the expression of ΔE9 polypeptides led to diminished accumulation of endogenous PS1 NTFs and CTFs, indicating that the ΔE9 PS1 protein competes with authentic full-length PS1 for entry into the stabilization/cleavage pathway. To determine whether ΔE9 PS1 is actually stabilized, the half-life of ΔE9 huPS1 was examined in stably transfected N2a cell lines. Forty-eight-hour inductions with butyrate resulted in the appearance of ΔE9 huPS1 polypeptides (Fig.6, compare lanes 1 and2). In parallel to the increase in ΔE9 huPS1, the levels of endogenous mouse CTFs were diminished (Fig. 6, lane 2). Removal of butyrate and further incubation in standard medium demonstrated that a substantial portion of the ΔE9 PS1 polypeptide persisted for more than 40 h (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and4) (mRNA expression returns to basal levels in less than 20 h of chase; see Fig. 5). Thus, we conclude that the ΔE9 PS1 polypeptide is capable of being stabilized despite its inability to be endoproteolytically processed. The high stability of ΔE9 huPS1 indicates that full-length PS1 possesses the signals for entry into the stabilization/cleavage pathway. To test whether individual NTFs can be stabilized, we inserted recombinant PS1 cDNAs that terminate at amino acid 306 (huPS1306Δ) into the pCB6 vector and generated stable N2a cell lines. Based on previous studies (9Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N. Copeland N.

Dis. 1997; 3: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), amino acid 306 is predicted to lie 10 residues C-terminal of the cleavage site that creates the NTFs and CTFs. Using a monoclonal antibody specific for the N terminus of huPS1 (N-term; Ref. 20Lah J.J. Heilman C.J. Nash N.R. Rees H.D. Yi H. Counts S.E. Levey A.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1971-1980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), immunoblot analyses of lysates from butyrate-induced cells revealed an ∼30-kDa polypeptide (Fig.7 A, lane 2) that migrated only slightly slower than huNTFs generated by proteolysis of full-length PS1 precursors (Fig. 7 B, lane 2). To determine whether huPS1306Δ polypeptides were stabilized, cells were induced for 48 h, then chased in standard medium for varied intervals. Compared with cells expressing full-length PS1 polypeptide (Fig. 7, B and D), which generated very stable NTFs and CTFs, little, if any, of the huPS1306Δ polypeptides were stabilized (Fig.7 A). These data are consistent with the idea that the signals for stabilization reside in the C-terminal portion of full-length PS1. Notably, immunoblot analyses of cells expressing PS1306Δ with αPS1Loop antiserum demonstrated that endogenous murine PS1 C-terminal fragments continued to accumulate in the presence of huPS1306Δ (Fig. 7 C, lane 2). These data indicate that the presence of excess huPS1306Δ mRNA does not interfere with translation of endogenous mRNA. Therefore, the observed “replacement” of endogenous murine PS1 derivatives by the wild-type huPS1 derivatives upon butyrate induction (see Figs. 5 A and 6) is likely to be regulated at the level of competition for entry into the stabilization/cleavage pathway. The present study demonstrates that full-length PS1 polypeptides are relatively short-lived molecules, whereas the NTFs and CTFs of huPS1 are long-lived. Although full-length polypeptide may have functions, the long half-lives of the processed derivatives suggest that these species of PS1 are not merely intermediates in a degradation pathway, but instead represent the appropriately targeted, mature, and functional forms of PS1. Several lines of evidence support the view that endoproteolytic cleavage is a late event in the maturation of PS1, occurring after full-length polypeptides are stabilized. First, we failed to demonstrate the presence of short-lived pools of PS1 CTFs, as would be expected had cleavage preceded stabilization. Second, ΔE9 huPS1 was capable of being stabilized. Finally, recombinant N-terminal PS1 polypeptides terminating at residue 306 showed short half-lives. Collectively, these findings suggest that the signals for stabilization reside in the C-terminal domain of full-length polypeptide. Whether an individual CTF is capable of being stabilized is difficult to assess because the membrane topology of the C-terminal domain is dictated by the adjoining N-terminal domain (6Doan A. Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Slunt H.H. Ratovitsky T. Podlisny M. Selkoe D.J. Seeger M. Gandy S.E. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1023-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), making it difficult to express CTFs alone. However, we believe it likely that only full-length PS1 polypeptides are capable of entering the stabilization/cleavage pathway because such a mechanism is the best way to explain the observed 1:1 stoichiometry of huPS1 NTFs and CTFs in the brains of transgenic mice (9Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N. Copeland N. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S.

To explain our observations in the present and previous studies, we propose a model (Diagram 1) in which newly synthesized full-length PS1 polypeptides first become associated with cellular proteins, which are responsible for its initial stabilization, and only later are endoproteolytically cleaved. Several observations suggest that the factors responsible for targeting and delivery of PS1 into the “stabilization/cleavage” pathway are limiting. First, despite tremendous increases in steady-state levels of PS1 mRNA and full-length protein, following butyrate induction, parallel increases in the total levels of NTF and CTF are not observed (see Figs. 1 and 2). Second, previous analyses of several lines of transgenic mice expressing different levels of huPS1 demonstrated that the levels of full-length PS1 polypeptide increase proportionately with mRNA levels but the levels of both NTFs and CTFs are maximal at relatively low levels of transgene mRNA expression (9Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N. Copeland N. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S.

Med. 1997; 3: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and cultured cells (see Figs. 5 A and6), the high level expression of huPS1 leads to decreased accumulation of mouse NTFs and CTFs. Collectively, these data suggest that, under conditions of hyperexpression, excess huPS1 polypeptides compete with mouse PS1 polypeptide for a limited supply of factors that specify targeting to the “stabilization/cleavage pathway.” Whether endoproteolytic cleavage modifies the function of PS1 is unclear at present. Previous studies have demonstrated that the egg-laying defects in C. elegans, lacking the PS1 homologue sel-12, can be rescued by ΔE9 huPS1 (5Levitan D. Doyle T.G. Brousseau D. Lee M.K. Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H. Sisodia S.S. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14940-14944Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Moreover, we demonstrate here that ΔE9 huPS1 can be stabilized without cleavage. Thus, whether endoproteolytic cleavage modifies function is uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, the high stability of the NTFs and CTFs suggest that these processed derivatives represent the functional entities of PS1. The factors necessary for the targeting of PS1 to the “stabilizing/cleavage” pathway appear to be present in subsaturating levels and thus provide a mechanism to regulate the cellular levels of PS1 post-translationally. Whether these targeting factors are permanently associated with PS1 in some type of stable, functional complex is presently unclear (24Seeger M. Nordstedt C. Petanceska S. Kovacs D.M. Gouras G.K.

It is anticipated that the molecular characterization of proteins that assist in the stabilization/cleavage of PS1 may provide important insights into the function of the protein and could lead to the identification of other molecules that play roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

In the cell transfected with the HIV Tat cDNA, the promoter-bound Tat can recruit a p32/VP16 fusion protein to the promoter (3Yu L. Zhang Z. Loewenstein P.M. Desai K. Tang Q. Mao D. Symington J.S.

In addition to these proteins, p32 can interact with globular heads of C1q (gC1q). Because the recombinant p32 protein inhibits C1q hemolytic activity (10Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.L. Peerschke E.I.B.

Irrespective of the binding of p32 to many substances, the functional aspects of these associations are not appropriately defined. For example, p32 is neither cross-linked to RNA nor effective to the splice site selection (1Krainer A.R. Mayeda A. Kozak D. Binns G. Cell. 1991; 66: 383-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), casting a question about the contribution to spliceosome. p32 must be localized in the nucleus to functionally associate with SF2/ASF, HIV Tat, Rev, transcription factor IIB, and lamin B receptor. Although p32 is proposed to be in the nucleus (8Simons G. Georgatos S.D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), it is not unambiguous because the crude nuclear fraction, a 1,000 ×g pellet, is usually contaminated with other fractions of cells (15Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To interact with gC1q, H-kininogen, hyaluronic acid, and vitronectin, p32 must exist at the extracellular side of plasma membrane. There is evidence for the presence of p32 in the membrane fraction (13Deb T.B. Datta K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2206-2212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The reported membrane fraction, which is prepared by 30,000 × g centrifugation of post-nuclear supernatant (13Deb T.B. Datta K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2206-2212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), would contain many organelles including mitochondria which are pelleted by 7,000 × g centrifugation. More recently, most of p32 has been suggested to be localized in cytoplasm but neither in nucleus nor on plasma membrane (16Dedio J. Esterl W.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition to uncertainty of p32 localization, the possibility is raised that p32, which is a highly acidic protein with pI 4.2, nonspecifically interacts with the basic region of nuclear proteins (4Fridell R.A. Harding L.S. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. Virology. 1995; 209: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, despite the many studies on p32, its physiological role remains to be clarified. To elucidate the function of p32, we cloned yeast p30 gene, a yeast counterpart of human p32, and precisely examined the intracellular localization of human p32 and yeast p30 proteins. Here we show that both p32 and p30 proteins are exclusively localized in the mitochondrial matrix and that they are functionally important in maintaining mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. U937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2humidified incubator. After the growth reached 60–70% confluence, the cells were harvested and homogenized in the homogenizing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA). The subcellular fractions were obtained as described (17Kang D. Nishida J. Iyama A. Nakabeppu Y. Furuichi M. Fujiwara T. Sekiguchi M. Takeshige K. J. Biol.

Briefly, the crude mitochondrial fraction (7,000 × g pellet of 700 × g supernatant) was layered on the discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of successive 4.5 ml of 1.6 m, 1.0 m sucrose from the bottom and centrifuged at 100,000 × g. The band between 1.6 and 1.0 m sucrose was collected for the mitochondrial fraction. The crude nuclear fraction (700 × g pellet) was loaded on the top of discontinuous sucrose gradient made by successive layering of 4.5 ml of 2.0 and 1.6 m sucrose containing 1 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet at the bottom was collected and used for nuclear fraction. The mitochondrial fraction was further separated (17Kang D. Nishida J. Iyama A. Nakabeppu Y. Furuichi M. Fujiwara T. Sekiguchi M. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14659-14665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Three mg of the mitochondrial fraction in 0.5 ml of buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 250 mm sucrose) was sonicated at output 5.0 for 10 s with an Ultrasonic processor (Tokyorika, Tokyo, Japan) 5 times and centrifuged at 100,000 × g. The resulting pellets and supernatant were used as membrane and soluble fractions, respectively. To disrupt outer membrane, the mitochondrial fraction was suspended in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets and supernatant were used as mitoplasts and intermembranous fractions, respectively. Human cDNA library (Human HeLa S3 MATCHMAKER cDNA Library,CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was used for amplification of human p32 cDNA. The DNA fragment corresponding to the mature form of p32-(74–282) was amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers H74 (5′-GAATTCTTTCGCGATGCTGCCTCT-3′) containing EcoRI site at its 5′-end and H282TGA (5′-GGATCCGCTCTACTGGCTCTTGAC-3′) containingBamHI site at its 5′-end and stop codon of p32. The PCR product was subcloned into the vector pCR™II (Invitrogen BV, De Schelp, NV Leek, The Netherlands) to generate pCRHm and then the sequence of the insert was examined to be correct. The EcoRI-BamHI fragment from pCRHm was inserted into the vector pBluscriptII (Stratagene Ltd., Innovation Center, Cambridge). Then the vector was digested by XhoI andBamHI. The XhoI-BamHI fragment was inserted into XhoI-BamHI sites of the vector pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI) to generate the expression vector pETHm for producing a mature form of human p32 with His-tag at its N terminus in Escherichia coli. The vectors for expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged p32 protein in PLC cells were constructed as follows. First, a vector containing cDNA for HA-tag (pBHA) was made. Oligonucleotide (5′-TTGGATCCGTACCCCTATGATGTGCCTGACTATGCTGGTAGCTCTCATCATCATCATCATCATAGCAGCGGATGACTCGAGTT-3′) encoding the 12 amino acids of influenza HA epitope plus six histidine repeat was annealed with its antisense oligonucleotide. TheBamHI-XhoI fragment of this DNA was inserted intoBamHI-XhoI sites of pBluscriptII to generate pBHA. Then, the full-length cDNA of human p32 was amplified by PCR from the cDNA library with gene-specific primers H1 (5′-GAATTCTTTCCGCGATGCTGCCTCT-3′) containing EcoRI site at its 5′-end and H282 (5′-GGATCCTGGCTCTTGACAAAACT-3′) containingBamHI site at its 5′-end. To generate a DNA fragment coding a mature form of p32-(74–282) without stop codon, a PCR reaction was performed using primers H282 and H73ATG (5′-GAATTCATGCTGCACACCGACGGAGAC-3′) harboring the BamHI site at its 5′-end and ATG initiation codon. The two kinds of PCR products were cloned into pCR™II to generate pCRH1 and pCRH74, respectively. The sequences were examined to be correct. TheEcoRI-BamHI fragments from pCRH1 and pCRH74 were inserted into pBHA (pBHA1 and pBHA74, respectively). Two expression vectors of p32 with HA-tag at the C terminus, pCIHA1 and pCIHA74, were constructed by inserting the XbaI-XhoI fragment from pBHA1 and pBHA74 into the vector pCIneo (Promega, Madison, WI). A PCR reaction was performed with the primer H1 and H282TGA, and the PCR product was subcloned into pCR™II, the sequence was compatible with those previously reported (18Honore B. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. Leffers H. Gene ( Amst .). 1993; 134: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The EcoRI fragment containing p32 full-length cDNA was inserted into EcoRI site of pGAP (19Tanaka K. Matsumoto K. Toh-e A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), containing yeast replication 2μ origin and glyceraldehyde triphosphates dehydrogenase promoter, to generate the expression vector pGAPH1 of 1–282 amino acid residues of human p32 in yeast cells. Recombinant human p32 and yeast p30 proteins were obtained by expressing under the control of T7 promoter in E. coli. Briefly, BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pETHm or pGEXY114 (the constructions are described in elsewhere). The cells were grown in 200 ml of LB containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin untilA 600 of culture medium reached 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested, and the fusion protein was purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. To obtain polyclonal antibodies against human p32 protein and yeast p30 protein, 500 μg each of the recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli was emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant (Difco) and injected into a Japanese white rabbit. Two weeks later, the first booster injection (500 μg) was given, followed by three booster injections at 2-week intervals. Sera were obtained 2 weeks after the last booster injection. The His-tag region of recombinant p32 protein was removed with thrombin. The recombinant p32 without His-tag was covalently linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), which was used to purify the antibodies against p32. The antibodies against glutathione S-transferase (GST) portion in anti-GST-p30 fusion protein antiserum was absorbed in GST-Sepharose 4B. Proteins were separated on 10 or 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After the membrane was incubated in the blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature for 2 h or at 4 °C overnight, the membrane was then incubated with 0.5 μg/ml affinity purified anti-p32 antibody, 5,000-fold diluted anti-p30 antiserum, or 0.2 μg/ml anti-60-kDa heat shock protein monoclonal antibody (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) in the blocking buffer for 1 h and washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 5 min three times. The membrane was then incubated in PBS-T containing 0.1 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Int., Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) for 30 min. The immunoreactive bands were detected using a chemiluminescent substrate as in manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Corp.). The signals was quantified using NIH image program (20Seebacher T. Bade E.G.

Biochem. 1996; 237: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The absolute amount of p32 in the mitochondrial fraction and total lysate was determined by comparing signal intensities to those of serial concentrations of purified recombinant p32 protein (6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 ng). Indirect immunofluorescence staining of the cells was done as described by Larsson et al. (22Larsson S.H. Charlieu J.P. Miyagawa K. Engelkamp D. Rassoulzadegan M. Ross A. Cuzin F. Heyningen V. Hastie N.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 391-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) after the cells were fixed and permeabilized with 50% methanol and 50% acetone for 10 min at room temperature and rehydrated. Secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate was used against rabbit IgG (American Qualex, San Clemente, CA). Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry of mitochondria of Jurkat cells was done as described previously (17Kang D. Nishida J. Iyama A. Nakabeppu Y. Furuichi M. Fujiwara T. Sekiguchi M. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14659-14665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The pCIneo vectors containing p32 cDNA with HA tag were transfected into PLC cells as described by Kamura et al. (23Kamura T. Handa H. Hamasaki N. Kitajima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11361-11368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 2 μg of each plasmid DNA and 4.5 μl of cationic liposome (Promega, Madison, WI) were mixed in 200 μl of PBS and added to the cells. After incubation for 60 min at 37 °C, the cells were resuspended in 2 ml of complete medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and cultured on a 35-mm dish. For immunostaining, a part of the cells were plated onto a four-well tissue culture chamber (Division of Miles Laboratories, Inc,. Naperville, IL). After incubation for 48 h at 37 °C, the cells on a four-well tissue culture chamber were fixed and stained. The cells cultured on a 35-mm dish were harvested and immunoblotted with polyclonal antibody raised against HA-tag (Babco, Richmond, CA) or purified anti-p32 antibody. The strains ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae used had the following genotypes: YPH499 (MATa wa3-52, lys 2-801, ade 2-101, trp 1-63, his 3-300, leu 2-1), and YPH500 (MATα, ura 3-52, lys 2-801, ade 2-101, trp 1-63, his 3-200, leu 2-1). Yeast cells were grown in the medium consisting of 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% glucose (YPD) or 3% glycerol (YPG). Solid medium consisted of 2% Bacto-agar, 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% glucose (YPDagar) or 3% glycerol (YPGagar). Yeast transformation was performed by the lithium chloride procedure as described by Ito et al.(24Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mating the haploid strain was performed as described by Kaiseret al. (25Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Total lysate of yeast cells for SDS-PAGE was prepared as described by Yamazaki et al. (26Yamazaki S. Harashima S. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Data base sequence comparison was performed using FASTA and BLAST program as described (27Pearson W.R. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 227-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) The yeast p30 gene encoding 1–266 amino acids was amplified with a primer UY1 (5′-AAGCTTAAACAACAAATAATGTTCTT-3′) containing HindIII site at its 5′-end and a primer LY266 (5′-GGATCCAAGTGGAAAAACTTCTTCA-3′) containing BamHI site at its 5′-end. The PCR was performed on genomic DNA from yeast strain YPH499. The PCR product was subcloned into the vector pCR™II to generate pCRY1. Two independent clones in which the sequences completely matched those deposited in GenBank were used for yeast p30 cDNA. A vector of yeast p30 (pGAPY1) for the protein expression in yeast cells was constructed by inserting EcoRI fragment from pCRY1 into EcoRI site of pGAP. To construct a cDNA for a GST-yeast p30-(114–266) fusion protein, a DNA fragment encoding 114–266 amino acids of p30 was amplified with a gene-specific primer MY (5′-GAATTCATGGACGTAGCTCAGATTGCTAAT-3′) containing EcoRI site at its 5′-end and the primer LY266. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR™II to generate pCRY114.EcoRI-BamHI fragment from pCRY114 was inserted into pGEX-4TK vector (Pharmacia). The resulting expression vector pGEXY114 was used for producing a GST-yeast p30-(114–266) fusion protein in E. coli. Deletion of most of the p30 gene was carried out by a one-step replacement (28Rothenstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). A targeting vector for yeast p30 cDNA was constructed as follows. PCR was performed on genomic DNA from yeast strain YPH500 with primers TU1 (5′-GGTTGAAAAGGCTTCCAGACAAC-3′) and TU2 (5′-CATATGTGATAGTTTATGTATCTT-3′). TU1 corresponds to 592 bp upstream of initiation codon. TU2 corresponds to 24 bp upstream of initiation ATG (A = 0 bp) codon of yeast p30 open reading frame and containsNdeI site at its 5′-end. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR™II to generate pCR-U. Another PCR reaction was performed with primers TL1 (5′-TGGATCCTTATGTTGATAGTGCTACTC-3′) and TL2 (5′-GAGCTCAGCTGCCTGTTGCCAACTATT-3′). TL1 is complementary 261 bp upstream of the termination site and contains the adopter ofBamHI site at its 5′-end. TL2 is complementary 258 bp downstream of termination TAA (A = 0 bp) codon of yeast p30 open reading frame and contains the adopter of SacI site at its 5′-end. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR™II to generate pCR-L. The 1229-bp PvuII-BamHI fragment from the plasmid pGBT9 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA), which contains the TRP1 yeast auxotrophic marker, was inserted intoPvuII and BamHI sites of pBR322 to generate pBR-T. The 1460-bp fragment containing TRP1 was excised from pBR-T with NdeI and BamHI. The fragment was inserted into NdeI and BamHI sites of pCR-U to generate pCR-UT. The 520-bp BamHI-SacI fragment from pCR-L was inserted into BamHI and SacI sites of pCR-UT to generate pCR-UTL. The DNA for targeting was liberated from the plasmid by EcoRI-SacI digestion and used to transform the haploid strain YPH500 to generate strain YPH500 (Δp30::TRP1). To replace TRP1 byHIS3, the NdeI-SalI fragment containing TRP1 of the plasmid pCR-UTL was removed, and the resulting cohesive ends of the plasmid were filled and ligated to each other, and then a BamHI fragment from the vector pYAC3 (29Ward E.R. Jen G.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 14: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) containing HIS3 was inserted into the BamHI site of the TRP1 gene-deleted plasmid to generate pCR-UHL. TheEcoRI-SacI fragment from the plasmid was used to transform the haploid strain YPH499 and generate strain YPH499 (Δp30::His3). The gene disruptions of p30 were verified at the DNA level (30Baudin A. Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar) and by Northern hybridization analysis (31Kondo K. Inouye M. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9320-9331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Spheroplasts prepared by the treatment of zymolyase 20T (10 mg for 1 g of cells) (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) were homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged at 700 ×g. The resulting post-mitochondrial supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was used as a cytosol fraction, and the pellet was used as a microsomal fraction. Purity of the subcellular fractions was analyzed by the activities of marker enzymes as described under “Fractionation of U937 Cells.” The mitochondrial fraction was sonicated and centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 60 min. The resulting supernatant was used as a mitochondrial soluble fraction, and the pellet was used as a mitochondrial membrane fraction. A mitoplast fraction was prepared by osmotic shock as described by Daum et al. (33Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of lactate dehydrogenase was measured by the method of Bergmeyer et al. (34Bergmeyer H.U. Bernt E. Hess B. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis.

Neurology. 1990; 40: 495-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were measured as described. One unit of the activities for adenylate kinase and fumarase was defined as the absorbance change of 1.0/min. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. To assess the intracellular localization of p32 protein in cultured cells, we performed immunofluorescence staining using the affinity purified anti-p32 antibody (Fig. 1 A). A coarse granular pattern was observed in the cytoplasm of U937 cells and Jurkat cells. In PLC cells, we observed a reticular, lacy cytoplasmic staining pattern. In the three cell lines, nuclei were hardly stained. These patterns of staining are typically observed when mitochondrial components are immunostained (15Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J.

Each value is shown a mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Mitochondria, mitochondrial fraction: cytosol, cytosolic fraction; microsomes, microsomal fraction. To biochemically confirm the mitochondrial localization of p32, U937 cells were fractionated into cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions. The contamination of each fraction with the other fractions was less than 4%, as judged by the specific activities of marker enzymes,i.e. lactate dehydrogenase, succinate-cytochromec reductase, and rotenone-insensitive NADPH-cytochromec reductase for cytosol, mitochondria, and microsomes, respectively (Table I). When the total homogenates were immunoblotted with anti-p32 antibody, a protein of 32 kDa was specifically detected (Fig. 1 B, left panel). This band was not visible with preimmune serum (Fig.1 B, right panel). Recombinant p32 protein migrates slower than the endogenous p32 protein due to its additional His-tag (Fig.1 B). p32 was detected in the mitochondrial fraction but not in the cytosolic or microsomal fractions (Fig.2 A). Compared with the known amount of recombinant p32, the specific content of p32 in the mitochondrial frction was 1.43 ng/mg protein (Table I).

Its functions in these tissues include lubrication and protection of the epithelia, and roles in cell adhesion have been suggested (6Sawada T. Ho J.J.L. Chung Y.-S. Sowa M. Kim Y.S. Int. J.

Moreover, MUC1 is aberrantly expressed by tumors (9Ho S.B. Niehans G.A. Lyftogt C. Yan P.S. Cherwitz D.L. Gum E.T. Dahiya R. Kim Y.S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 641-651PubMed Google Scholar) with patterns of post-translational modifications that are different from corresponding normal cell types (10Brockhausen I. Yang J.-M. Burchell J. Whitehouse C. TaylorPapadimitriou J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar); several different glycoforms of MUC1 were originally described as “tumor-associated antigens.” Although MUC1 has been the subject of a number of lines of research, little is known about the mechanisms that direct its diverse post-translational processing. Until recently, there has been little precise information available on the O-glycosylation of MUC1 with respect to blood group antigens.

In addition, the glycosylation of MUC1 purified from a human mammary tumor cell line (T47D), solid tumor, and human breast milk has been described (14Hanisch F.-G. Stadie T.R.E. Deutzmann F. Peter-Katalinic J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 318-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A major problem in detecting and purifying different glycoforms of the MUC1 core protein is that monoclonal antibodies raised against the core protein bind epitopes in the tandem repeat domain. Many forms of MUC1 that are secreted by different adenocarcinomas are heavily glycosylated in this domain, which obscures the protein epitopes recognized by these anti-MUC1 antibodies. Polyclonal antibodies generated against the cytoplasmic tail (15Pemberton L. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Gendler S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) do not bind the secreted forms of the protein or some intracellular forms that are proteolytically processed (16Boshell M. Lalani E.-N. Pemberton L. Burchell J. Gendler S.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It has been impossible to purify single mucin core proteins by standard biochemical approaches because the biophysical properties of most mucin core proteins are very similar. We developed an epitope-tagged form of MUC1 to circumvent these problems and facilitate analysis of its post-translational processing. The use of an antibody to the epitope tag allows the detection of multiple MUC1 glycoforms, even with a background of endogenous MUC1 and other mucin-like core proteins. In this report, we identify carbohydrate epitopes that are found on MUC1 expressed in two pancreatic tumor cell lines and two colon tumor cell lines. Restriction enzymes and ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. PNGase F was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Eppley Institute Core Laboratory. Monoclonal antibodies were obtained from the following sources: mAb M2 was purchased from IBI; CO514, CO431, B93.1, and CSLEX1 were the gift of Mark Reddish of Biomera Corp.; CA19–9 was a gift from Hilary Koprowski; HMFG-2 was the gift of Sandra Gendler; CA-2 was the gift of Michael Bramwell; and CC49 was the gift of David Colcher. FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig was purchased from Southern Biotechnology Associates, and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG serum was purchased from Sigma. Enhanced chemiluminescence kits were purchased from Amersham Life Sciences and Pierce. Lipofectin was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Cell culture medium was purchased from Celox or Life Technologies, Inc., and fetal bovine serum and Geneticin (G418) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. A double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide was designed to encode the amino acid sequence DYKDDDDQILDMVA in which DYKDDDD is the Flag® epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody M2 (17Brizzard B.L. Chubet R.G. Vizard D.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 730-734PubMed Google Scholar). The remainder of the inserted amino acid sequence (QILDMVA) is a result of the addition of two unique restriction enzyme sites, BglII and Tth111I, which were included to facilitate screening for successful insertion of the double-stranded oligonucleotide and for future cloning purposes. This oligonucleotide was ligated into a BsmI site at position 232 of the MUC1 cDNA (see Fig. 1 B). In-frame insertion of the oligonucleotide was verified by sequence analysis. Panc-1 and S2-013 cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Caco-2 and HT-29 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine. The cells were passaged at >80% confluence using 0.1% trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 0.2 mm EDTA. Epitope-tagged MUC1 (MUC1F) cDNA was subcloned into the expression vector pHβ-APr1-neo (18Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.-Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S .A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) at the BamHI site. Panc-1 and S2-013 (pancreatic adenocarcinomas) were transfected with plasmid DNA using the Lipofectin method. Cells were plated in six-well culture plates and grown to approximately 70% confluence. Growth medium was removed, the cells were washed twice in serum-free MEM, and then incubated 12 h in 1 ml of serum-free MEM with 10 μl of Lipofectin reagent and 10 μg of circular plasmid DNA. The transfection medium was replaced with normal growth medium, and after 48 h each well was passaged into a 10-cm plate with growth medium containing G418 at 600 μg/ml. After 7–10 days, the cells were passaged and plated at approximately 30–50 cells/plate, and single colonies were selected and expanded for screening. HT-29 and Caco-2 (colon adenocarcinomas) were transfected using the calcium phosphate method and selected with growth medium containing G418 at 500 μg/ml. The clonal cell lines were evaluated for expression of the Flag epitope by analyzing surface immunofluorescence. Cells were plated in 24-well cell culture plates, allowed to grow to >80% confluence, stained using mAb M2 (10 μg/ml) and a goat anti-mouse-FITC second antibody (10 μg/ml), and fixed with 4% formalin in PBS (145 mm NaCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 2.5 mmNaH2PO4). Cell lines expressing the Flag epitope were evaluated for co-expression of Flag and MUC1 epitopes by Western blotting with M2 and one anti-MUC1 peptide antibody (HMFG-2 or CA-2). Cell lysates were prepared by scraping cells into 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0% Triton X-100) with a rubber cell scraper. After a 30-min incubation on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 1000 ×g (4 °C) for 30 s to remove cell debris, supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, and the lysates were stored at −20 °C. Protein content of the lysates was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standards. M2 antibody conjugated to agarose beads (IBI) was placed in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes with cell lysate and incubated at 4 °C on a shaker for 15 h. The agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and washed two times with NET (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris) + 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The washed pellets were resuspended in NET + 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for PNGase F treatment, or boiled in sample loading buffer (2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) for loading on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Cell lysates and immunoprecipitated protein were resolved on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (with 3% polyacrylamide stacking gel), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes electrophoretically, and blocked in 5% dry milk in TBS (0.9% NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% MgCl2) overnight. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:2000 in blotto (5% nonfat dry milk in TBS). Incubations were for 1 h at room temperature and were followed by three 10-min washes with blotto. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were diluted 1:2500 in blotto, and incubations were for 1 h at room temperature. Second antibody incubations were followed by three washes as above. ECL reagents were applied as per the manufacturer's instructions, and the blots were exposed to ECL-sensitive film (Amersham Life Sciences). Cells were cultured on coverslips and allowed to grow to approximately 60% confluence. After washing once with PBS, the cells were chilled on a bed of ice for 10 min, then incubated on ice in cold 5% MEM with 10 μg/ml M2 antibody for 1 h. After incubation with primary antibody, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold 5% MEM. The cells were then incubated on ice in cold 5% MEM with 10 μg/ml secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse Ig-FITC-conjugated). After incubation in secondary antibody, the cells were washed three times with cold PBS and fixed on ice for 15 min in 4% formalin. The cells were then washed once in PBS, and imaged on either a Zeiss inverted microscope with epifluorescence optics or a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal laser scanning microscope. Adherent cells were released from culture flasks by treating with 0.05 mm trypsin and 1.5 mm EDTA in PBS for 4 min at 37 °C. All subsequent steps were carried out on ice. Cell surface-associated MUC1F is stable to this treatment. The cells were resuspended in 5% MEM and incubated with the anti-epitope tag antibody at a concentration of 10 μg/ml for 30 min. The cells were washed with 5% MEM and incubated with a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse second antibody for 30 min. The cells were washed again, resuspended in 5% MEM, and analyzed on a FACStarPLUS (Becton Dickinson). MUC1F was immunopurified as outlined above. Immunopurified material was incubated overnight with 1.2 units of PNGase F supplemented with 10 mm EDTA at 37 °C. The total reaction volume (50 μl) was loaded in a single well for electrophoresis as described above for immunoblotting. A schematic of the MUC1 cDNA construct used in this study is shown in Fig.1. DNA encoding the Flag epitope was added to the MUC1 cDNA (Fig. 1 A) by ligating a double-stranded oligonucleotide into a BsmI site found 5′ to the region of the cDNA that encodes the tandem repeat domain. This resulted in the in-frame insertion of the sequence DYKDDDDQILDMVA on the amino-terminal side of the tandem repeat domain in the translated MUC1 core protein sequence (Fig. 1 B, MUC1F). A site toward the amino terminus of the MUC1 protein was chosen for the insertion because this yields recombinant product with the epitope tag on the extracellular surface of transfected cells, which allowed for convenient screening using surface immunofluorescence microscopy or fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Furthermore, it was predicted that placing the epitope tag at this position in the molecule would be unlikely to interfere with basic biological functions of epitope-tagged protein because the amino acid sequence of this region is poorly conserved among different species (19Spicer A.P.

Four cell lines were chosen in which to evaluate the epitope-tagged MUC1. The first, Panc-1, is a poorly differentiated human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line that expresses low levels of endogenous MUC1 (and other mucin-like glycoproteins) and relatively low levels of otherO-glycosylated glycoproteins (22Yonezawa S. Byrd J.C. Dahiya R. Ho J.J.L. Gum J.R. Griffiths B. Swallow D.M. Kim Y.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The second, S2-013, is a human pancreatic tumor cell line that is well differentiated and known to extensively O-glycosylate mucin-like proteins (23Iwamura T. Taniguchi S. Kitamura N. Yamanari H. Kojima A. Hidaka K. Setoguchi T. Katsuki T. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1992; 7: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Caco-2 and HT-29 are human colon tumor cell lines of mixed epithelial morphologies that express other mucin core proteins and tumor-associated carbohydrate epitopes (24Hollingsworth M.A. Strawhecker J.M. Caffrey T.C. Mack D.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Byrd J.C. Dahiya R. Huang J. Kim Y.S. Eur. J.

The MUC1F cDNA was subcloned at the BamHI site of the expression vector pHβ-APr1-neo vector, which we have previously used for establishing stable expression of MUC1 in a number of human and rodent cell lines (27Batra S.K. Kern H.F. Worlock A.J. Metzgar R.S. Hollingsworth M.A. J. Cell. Sci. 1991; 100: 841-849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Batra S.K Metzgar R.S. Worlock A.J. Hollingsworth M.A. Int. J.

Analysis of the primary sequence of MUC1 reveals the presence of five consensus N-linked glycosylation sites, at least some of which are known to be utilized (29Hilkens J. Buijs F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirmN-glycosylation of MUC1F and that insertion of the epitope tag near the signal sequence did not interfere with insertion of MUC1F into the endoplasmic reticulum, MUC1F expressed by Panc-1 was immunoprecipitated and treated with PNGase F. PNGase F treatment of MUC1F resulted in an increase in mobility on denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.2), demonstratingN-glycosylation of MUC1F. To test whether insertion of the epitope tag interfered with surface expression of MUC1F, a polyclonal population of Panc-1 cells expressing MUC1F was evaluated for surface expression of the Flag epitope by immunofluorescence. Approximately 25% of the cells surviving G418 selection were positive for expression of the Flag epitope in this assay (data not shown). Clonal populations of transfected Panc-1 cells displayed cell surface expression of MUC1F as detected by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Similar cell surface expression was seen in all transfected cell lines. Analysis by confocal microscopy of unpermeablized Panc-1 cells expressing MUC1F showed a rim fluorescence pattern indicative of surface localization of the MUC1F protein (Fig.3 E). Untransfected Panc-1 cells were unreactive with the M2 antibody (Fig. 3 B). The results of flow cytometry experiments showed that greater than 98% of unpermeablized Panc-1 cells expressing MUC1F were positive for surface expression of MUC1F (Fig. 3 F). Immunoprecipitated MUC1F protein derived from lysates of individual clones of the four cell lines stably expressing MUC1F was analyzed for the presence ofO-linked carbohydrate structures by Western blotting with a panel of antibodies against a number of tumor-associated and blood-group carbohydrate antigens (Fig.4, TableI). For all cell lines except Panc-1, multiple clones were evaluated. In each experiment, the anti-epitope tag antibody M2 was used to immunoprecipitate recombinant MUC1F glycoforms. The immunoprecipitated MUC1F was analyzed for expression of blood group antigens by Western blotting. Representative examples of Western blot data for the four cell lines is shown in Fig. 4.Table ISummary of Western blot analysis of MUC1 glycosylation by cell linesAntibodyStructureCell linePanc-1S2–013Caco-2HT-29CO514Lea−−/−1-aWhere two clones were evaluated, the results for each clone is reported.

For example, “−/+” would indicate that clone 1 was negative, and clone 2 was positive. Open table in a new tab Epitope tagged MUC1 was immunoprecipitated with an antibody against the epitope tag and Western blotted with a panel of anti-carbohydrate antibodies. The profile of reactivities of the antibodies with MUC1F was different for each of the four cell lines tested (Table I). Of the nine antibodies evaluated in this study, only CC49 (anti-sTn) was reactive with MUC1F expressed by Panc-1, while antibodies to Lea, sLea, Leb, sLec, Lex, sLex, and Ley structures were not. MUC1F expressed by the S2-013 cell line was found to carry the sLea, sLec, sLex (one out of two clones), and sTn structures, but not Lea, Leb, Lex, or Ley. HT-29 cells produced MUC1F that carried sLea, sLex, and sTn structures, while Caco-2 cells produced MUC1F carrying sLex and sTn. Extracts from untransfected or vector control transfected cell lines were also subjected to the immunoprecipitation protocol and evaluated with the panel of anti-carbohydrate antibodies in each experiment to control for nonspecific interactions of the M2-agarose reagent with other proteins in the cell extracts. In each of the cell lines, MUC1F was found to carry carbohydrate epitopes that were not detected in lysates prepared from untransfected or control transfected cells, even though some of the lines are known to express mucin and mucin-like proteins. For example, in the S2-013 cell line, sLec, sLex, and sTn were not detected on endogenous proteins by Western blotting, yet reactivity with antibodies against these structures was detected on MUC1F expressed by these cells. Pancreatic and colon tumor cells produce and secrete mucin-like molecules that contain complex oligosaccharide structures that correspond to several important blood group and tumor-associated antigens, such as those recognized by the monoclonal antibodies DUPAN-2 (sLec), CC49 (sTn), and CA19-9 (sLea). However, not every O-glycosylated protein that is expressed by pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells receives sLec, sTn, or sLea structures as part of their O-linked oligosaccharides, and in many cases it is not known which mucin-like core protein (or proteins) carries a given carbohydrate structure. We expressed an epitope-tagged MUC1 isoform (MUC1F) in four tumor cell lines and evaluated this epitope-tagged protein for the presence of nine blood group and tumor-associated antigens. Although there were some similarities in the types of oligosaccharides that were added to MUC1F by the different cell lines, each of the four tumor cell lines glycosylated MUC1F with a distinct set of carbohydrate structures. One simple structure, sTn, was found on MUC1F produced by all four tumor cell lines. Consistent with previous reports, a cell line derived from a pancreatic adenocarcinoma (S2-013) expressed the DUPAN-2 epitope (sLec), but the cell lines derived from colon carcinomas did not. It was also notable that sLex was found on MUC1F expressed by S2-013 cells and both of the colon tumor cell lines. For all cell lines evaluated here, carbohydrate epitopes not detected in untransfected or control transfected cell lysates were found on MUC1F. For example, MUC1F expression in S2-013 cells results in its glycosylation with sLec structures that could be bound by the antibody DUPAN-2. This result, coupled with the observation that DUPAN-2 does not bind to proteins in control S2-013 extracts, suggests that the appearance of this epitope is correlated with expression of the MUC1 protein. It is possible that expression of MUC1F provides a proper protein scaffold for the creation of epitopes that are detectable by these antibodies. For some of the antibodies used in this study, patches of carbohydrate moieties in a particular array may be required for antibody binding and this may be provided by the MUC1 tandem repeat. This leaves open the possibility that similar oligosaccharide structures exist in the cell on endogenousO-glycosylated proteins or glycolipids, but they are not detected by Western blotting because the array provided by these protein backbones may not bind efficiently to these antibodies. Another hypothesis that would explain the appearance of these structures after transfection with the MUC1F cDNA is that the primary amino acid sequence of MUC1F contributes to its glycosylation. For example, sequence motifs in the MUC1 protein may cause this protein to pass through the Golgi in a way that facilitates the construction of particular oligosaccharide structures by using glycosyltransferases that are constitutively expressed in a given cell type. This does not imply that MUC1 is the only protein that will receive a sLea structure in the S2-013 cells for example, only that it may contain sequence information that helps determine that this carbohydrate structure is created on this molecule by this cell line. The appearance of sTn oligosaccharide structures after transfection of the MUC1F cDNA may be a result of high levels of expression of MUC1F protein. Overexpression of a protein with multiple acceptor sites for O-glycosylation may saturate the post-translational modification system such that novel, truncated structures are created. This may explain in part the appearance of short oligosaccharides such as sTn on MUC1F in the studies reported here, and on MUC1 and other mucins that are overexpressed by tumors. There are reports that MUC1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain and that MUC1 associates with Grb2 and the Sos/Ras exchange protein (30Zrihan-Licht S. Baruch A. Keydar Orna Elroy-Stein Iafa Wreschner D.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 31Pandey P. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4000-4003PubMed Google Scholar). Although there is no published evidence supporting this hypothesis, it is possible that overexpression of MUC1F in these cells may influence signal transduction events that affect the types or levels of expression of certain glycosyltransferases that are required to create oligosaccharide structures. It is significant that carbohydrate structures such as sLeaand sLex are attached to MUC1 by tumor cells. MUC1 expression has been associated with a reduction in ability of cells growing in culture to aggregate (8Hilkens J. Ligtenberg M.J.L. Vos H.L. Litvinov S.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 359-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). This property of MUC1 is thought to result from its rigid and extended structure at the surface of the cell combined with an overall negative charge as a result of extensive sialylation. This may cause MUC1 to physically interfere with cell adhesion molecules by masking their presence on the surface. Blood group antigens on MUC1 may also contribute to adhesion properties of tumor cells. It may be advantageous for tumor cells to express an array of blood group antigen structures on cell surface-associated mucins such as MUC1 because this would allow them to mimic host mechanisms for leukocyte trafficking during the metastatic process. The recently cloned physiologic P-selectin ligand PSGL-1 (32Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M. Ahern T.J. Furie B. Cumming D.A. Larsen G.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1179-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) has a structure that is similar to MUC1 (with tandem repeats, a transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic tail) and receives O-glycosylation with sLea and sLex structures. These carbohydrate structures are known to bind to P-selectin expressed on activated endothelia and this interaction is an early event in leukocyte recruitment and extravasation at sites of inflammation (reviewed by Varki (33Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7390-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar)). Tumor cells expressing MUC1 and carbohydrate structures such as sLea and sLex may utilize these in cell-cell interactions during the metastatic process. Alternatively, secreted soluble forms of MUC1 carrying oligosaccharide blood group antigens may compete with selectin ligands on leukocytes and interfere with leukocyte trafficking to the tumor. This may explain in part how tumors evade infiltration and recognition by the immune system. In summary, the generation of an epitope-tagged version of MUC1 allowed us to identify O-linked oligosaccharide structures including Lewis blood group and tumor-associated antigens found on MUC1 expressed by pancreatic and colon tumor cell lines. These studies lay the ground work for further examination of the relationship between the primary structure of MUC1 and related O-glycosylated proteins, their post-translational processing in different cell types, and their biological functions.

These proteins are present in both excitable and nonexcitable cells. Their main functions are associated with the regulation of the resting membrane potential and the control of the shape and frequency of action potentials (1Rudy B.

Kv9.1 and Kv9.2 are new modulators of Kv2.α subunits but have no functional activity by themselves. The study also shows that Kv5.1 and Kv6.1 are also potent regulators of channels of the Kv2 family.

A BLAST search of the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base, using the query peptide sequence of Kv8.1, reveals two groups of matching EST coding for two new homologues of Kv channels. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the extremities of these two EST groups were synthesized (Genosys) and used in two polymerase chain reaction amplifications on mouse brain cDNA. The sequencing of cloned polymerase chain reaction products allowed the isolation of Kv9.1 and Kv9.2 probes that were used to screen 5 × 105 clones of a mouse brain cDNA library constructed with λZAP II vector (Stratagene). Probes ([α-32P]dCTP-labeled Kv9.1 and Kv9.2 fragments) were produced with a random primers kit from Amersham Corp. Filters were hybridized in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 4 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 45 °C overnight and washed to a final stringency of 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Three independent clones for Kv9.1 and one for Kv9.2 were isolated. The cDNA inserts were characterized by restriction enzyme analysis and by partial or complete DNA sequencing on both strands by the dideoxy nucleotide method using an automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 373A). Two Kv9.1 clones (2.2–2.3 kb long) and the Kv9.2 insert (5 kb long) were shown to contain a full-length ORF. The third Kv9.1 clone was identical but incomplete in its 5′-coding sequence. A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was probed with the32P-labeled inserts of pBS Kv9.1 or pBS Kv9.2 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Experiments were performed on adult Swiss mice using standard procedures (29Heurteaux C. Messier C. Destrade C. Lazdunski M. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 18: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The dissected organs (brains, spinal cords, and retina) were fixed in ice-cold 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium phosphate-buffered solution (PBS, pH 7.4) for 8 h and then immersed overnight at 4 °C in a 20% sucrose, PBS solution. Frozen sections (10 μm) were cut on a Cryostat (Leica) at −25 °C, collected on 3-aminopropylethoxysilane-coated slides, and stored at −20 °C until use. Specific antisense cRNA probes were generated with T7-RNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) by in vitro transcription using d-[33P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, ICN Radiochemicals), from EcoRI-linearized plasmid containing a 900-base pair fragment of Kv9.1 cDNA or a 560-base pair fragment of Kv9.2 cDNA in the 3′-untranslated sequence and in the cytoplasmic C-terminal coding sequence, inserted into pBluescript SK−. Sections were treated consecutively with 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 10 min, PBS for 3 min, 5 μg/ml proteinase K diluted in 0.1m Tris, 50 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) for 15 min at 37 °C, 4% paraformaldehyde, and PBS (pH 7.2) for 5 min. Slides were then rinsed for 10 min in PBS, acetylated for 10 min in 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 m triethanolamine and dehydrated. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 55 °C in hybridization buffer (50% deionized formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 500 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 1% Denhardt's solution, 5% Sarcosyl, 250 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mmNaPO4 in 2 × SSC, and the radiolabeled probe (at 0.2 ng/ml with specific activities of 8 × 108 dpm/μg). Following hybridization, sections were washed in 4 × SSC for 15 min and then twice in 1 × SSC for 30 min at 60 °C, treated with RNase A (5 μg/ml) in 2 × SSC for 15 min at 37 °C, and washed twice with 1 × SSC for 30 min, followed by two 15-min washes in 0.1 × SSC at 30 °C. Specimens were then dehydrated, air-dried, and exposed to Amersham β-max Hyperfilm for 5 days at 4 °C. Selected slides were dipped in Amersham LM1 photographic emulsion and exposed for 3 weeks at 4 °C and then developed in Kodak D-19 for 4 min. All slides were counterstained with hematoxylin/eosin. For control experiments, adjacent sections were hybridized with corresponding sense riboprobes or digested with RNase before hybridization. The coding sequences of Kv9.1, Kv9.2, Kv5.1 (IK8) and Kv6.1 (K13) were amplified using a low error rate DNA polymerase (PWO DNA polymerase, Boehringer Mannheim) and subcloned into pEXO vector (30Lingueglia E.

Capped cRNAs were synthesized in vitrofrom linearized plasmid by using the T7, T3, or SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega).

Xenopus laevis were purchased from C.R.B.M. (Montpellier, France). Pieces of the ovary were surgically removed, and individual oocytes were dissected away in a saline solution (ND96) containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES at pH 7.4 with NaOH. Stage V and VI oocytes were treated for 2 h with collagenase (1 mg/ml, type Ia, Sigma) in ND96 to discard follicular cells. cRNA solutions were injected (50 nl/oocyte) using a pressure microinjector (Inject+Matic, Switzerland). We have previously shown that a high level of expression of some cloned K+ channels could lead to high magnitude K+currents with major kinetic and voltage-dependence modifications when compared with currents of lower intensity (32Guillemare E. Honore E. Pradier L. Lesage F. Schweitz H. Attali B. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12463-12468Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 40Honoré E. Attali B. Romey G. Lesage F. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, particular attention was paid to compare currents of similar and relatively low intensities (under 5 μA for a test pulse at +50 mV). cRNAs were injected at 0.5 ng/oocyte for Kv2.1 and 10 ng/oocyte for Kv2.2. The oocytes were kept at 19 °C in the ND96 saline solution supplemented with gentamycin (5 μg/ml). Oocytes were studied within 2–4 days following injection of cRNA. In a 0.3-ml perfusion chamber, a single oocyte was impaled with two standard glass microelectrodes (1–2.5-megohm resistance) filled with 3 m KCl and maintained under a voltage clamp using a Dagan TEV 200 amplifier. Stimulation of the preparation, data acquisition, and analysis were performed using pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). All experiments were performed at room temperature (21–22 °C) in ND96 solutions. The activation phase of currents elicited by voltage steps to +30 mV, 1 s in duration, were fitted with a single exponential and the time constant τact was determined. Inactivation curves (see Figs. 5,E and F, and 7, E and F) were fitted with a Boltzman distribution of the form I = 1/1 + exp(V 1/2 inact/k inact).V 1/2 inact is the potential of half-inactivation and k inact is the slope factor. The tail currents were recorded at −40 mV after a 500-ms long prepulse to +50 mV, in standard ND96 solution. These currents were fitted with a single exponential characterized by a time constant τtail. The coding sequence of Kv9.1 was subcloned into the Flag-pRc/CMV vector as described previously for N-terminal-tagged Kv2.2 protein (21Hugnot J.P. Salinas M. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Weille J. Heurteaux C. Mattéi M.G. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3322-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, to link the T7 tag epitope (MASMTGGQQMG) to the N terminus of Kv9.2, the double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-GGGCTAGCTGATCAGAGGCCTCACCATGGCTAGTATGACTGGAGGACAGCAAATGGGATATCGCGACCAGCTGACTCGAGAATTCG-3′, which contains the restriction sites NheI andEcoRI in its extremities, was subcloned into the pCI vector (Promega) at the corresponding sites. This construction designated T7.tag-pCI contains EcoRV, NruI,PvuII, and XhoI cloning sites. The PCR fragment of Kv9.2 (see above under “cRNA Synthesis, Injection, and Electrophysiological Measurement in Xenopus Oocyts”) was digested in 5′ by XhoI and inserted inEcoRV-XhoI-linearized T7.tag-pCI vector to create a tagged-Kv9.2-expressing vector. COSm6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (60 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin). Two days before transfection 15 × 103 cells were plated on cover glasses onto 15-mm Petri dishes. The cells were transfected by a modification of the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method (41Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) using 1 or 2 μg of supercoiled DNA. Two days after transfection the cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed for 15 min with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. After rinsing twice with PBS, cells were permeabilized by incubation for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100. The sites of nonspecific binding were blocked by 2-h incubation with 5% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature. The cells were then incubated for 2 h with a mixture of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1/150 dilution, Kodak) or T7.Tag monoclonal antibody (1/250, NOVAGEN) with a BS solution (2% bovine serum albumin in PBS), followed by washing with PBS and incubation for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (1/200, Sigma) in BS. After washing in PBS then in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, cells were mounted in Vectashield Medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and observed with a Leitz Aristoplan microscope (Wild Leitz) using an interference blue (fluorescein isothiocyanate) filter and a 40× lens. Computer analyses were performed using Genetics Computer Group software. The phylogenetic tree (see Fig. 1 C) and the percentage of identity (Table I) were generated using the PILEUP multiple sequence analysis program with the conserved region corresponding to the amino acids from the position 24–435 of Kv9.1 (starting from residues NVGG to Y). The members of subfamilies used and their accession numbers are as follows: mKv1.1, Y00305; hKv1.3, M85217; rKv2.1, X16476; rKv2.2, M77482; rKv3.3, M84211; rKv3.4, X62841; rKv4.1,S64320; rKv5.1, M81783; rKv6.1, M81784; aKv7.1, L35766; and Kv8.1,U62810.Table IAmino acid identity between voltage-gated potassium channels of different subfamiliesKv5.1Kv6.1Kv8.1Kv9.1Kv9.2%3736373740Kv1.13937373738Kv1.34546494245Kv2.14547494245Kv2.24036373535Kv3.33935363334Kv3.43735383536Kv4.13730353334Kv7.110038393740Kv5.1100414039Kv6.11004449Kv8.110058Kv9.1100Kv9.2Percentages of identical positions were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The percentages for K+ channels of the same subfamily are shown in boldface. Open table in a new tab Percentages of identical positions were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The percentages for K+ channels of the same subfamily are shown in boldface. The Kv8.1 subunit is a new K+ channel subunit which is inactive by itself and which has recently been described to regulate both active subunits of the Kv2 potassium channel subfamily (21Hugnot J.P. Salinas M. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Weille J. Heurteaux C. Mattéi M.G. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3322-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Salinas M. de Weille J. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. Hugnot J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8774-8780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This result has suggested the existence of a new class of regulatory α subunits. To identify potential genes coding for parent sequences, the peptide sequence of the Kv8.1 subunit was used to search related sequences in GenBankTM data base using the BLAST sequence alignment program (42Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar). We identified two groups of human EST encoding a portion of a new α subunit (named Kv9.1) from the S3 to the S6 transmembrane domain for the EST group corresponding to the accession numbers H18119, H43697, H49525, H42586,H49759, H2O365, H18164, and H42586, and another new α subunit (named Kv9.2) from the S2 to S4 transmembrane domains for the EST groupR19352, H19204, and R34920. It was then postulated that these two groups of EST were partial copies of mRNAs coding for two new subunit homologues of the Kv8.1 K+ channel. Two DNA probes derived from these two groups of sequences were used to screen a mouse cDNA brain library. Three clones for Kv9.1 and one clone for Kv9.2 were obtained. Two of the three independent Kv9.1 clones found were full-length and presented the same expected open reading frame (ORF). Nevertheless, these two clones differed in their 5′-noncoding sequence upstream of the nucleotide −21. The 5.0-kb cDNA insert of the Kv9.2 clone also comprises the expected ORF. The methionine initiation codon for the longest ORF is preceded by several in-frame termination triplets. In addition, nucleotide sequences surrounding the initiation codon of both Kv9.1 and Kv9.2 clones correspond to the Kozak consensus sequence (43Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). The ORFs of Kv9.1 and Kv9.2 encode proteins of 497 and 477 amino acids, respectively, with a calculated molecular mass of 54.9 and 54.3 kDa (Fig. 1 A). Protein sequences reveal that all the structural characteristics of outward rectifier voltage-gated K+ channel α subunits (Kv) are conserved in Kv9.1 and Kv9.2, i.e. six putative transmembrane segments (S1 to S6), a transmembrane region (S4) showing five positively charged amino acids and a conserved pore-forming region (named H5 or P domain). As indicated in Fig. 1 A, Kv9.1 and Kv9.2 subunits contain several putative phosphorylation sites located in the cytoplasmic regions for protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, Ca2+-calmodulin kinase II, casein kinase II, and tyrosine kinase. No N-glycosylation sequence was detected. The identity between these two new α subunits is about 58% and they have only 33–49% identity with other Kv channel subunits (TableI). Thus, they belong to the same subfamily (44Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. Voltage-gated K+ Channels. CRC, Boca Raton, FL1995Google Scholar). The phylogenetic tree presented in Fig. 1 Cindicates that the Kv9 α subunits have a common ancestor with other “nonfunctional” α subunits such as Kv5.1, Kv6.1, and Kv8.1, as well as with the Kv2 family. Northern blot analysis presented in Fig.2 shows that Kv9.1 and Kv9.2 mRNAs are expressed only in the brain. Specific probes detected two transcripts for Kv9.1 with an estimated size of 2.2 and 2.7 kb and one for Kv9.2 of approximately 5.3 kb. No expression was observed in heart, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, or testis. The two Kv9.1 transcripts probably represent alternatively spliced variants in the 5′-noncoding region as shown by sequencing of the different clones. The regional distribution of Kv9.1 and Kv9.2 mRNA was studied from analysis of x-ray film images and emulsion-coated sections of adult mouse brains cut in sagittal and coronal planes and detected byin situ hybridization. Specific cRNA probes revealed a wide and heterogeneous expression pattern in adult mouse brain (Fig.3 A). The heterogeneous distribution of the hybridization signal and the observation of emulsion-dipped sections suggested a neuronal localization of the transcripts. Sense probes did not show significant hybridization (data not shown). Examination of adjacent sections hybridized with Kv9.1 and Kv9.2 cRNA probes indicated that the distribution of Kv9.1 transcripts was strikingly similar to that observed for Kv9.2, with highest expression levels in the main olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, habenula, basolateral amygdaloid nuclei, and cerebellum. In the olfactory system (Fig. 3 B), cells expressing Kv9.1 and Kv9.2 mRNA were localized in the glomerular cell layer, the densely packed internal granular layer, and the thin mitral and internal plexiform cell layers. Within the glomerular layer, transcripts were restricted to the periglomerular cells whose processes extend into the glomerula. In contrast, light diffuse labeling was observed in the external plexiform layer and the olfactory nerve layer. In addition to the main olfactory bulb, Kv9.1 and Kv9.2 expression was also prominent in the anterior olfactory nuclei and the piriform (primary olfactory) cortex. In the hippocampus (Fig. 3 C), Kv9.1 and Kv9.2 mRNAs were strongly expressed in dentate granule cells and hilar neurons as well as in CA1–CA3 pyramidal cells. In addition, intense hybridization signals were observed in large interneurons located in stratum oriens and radiatum of all subfields. Many cells in the subiculum and enthorinal cortex of the hippocampal formation were also found to be positive. In the neocortex (Fig.3 D), Kv9.1 and Kv9.2 gene expression was observed in all cortical areas with a labeling pattern reflecting the laminar structure of cell distribution. These two transcripts were strongly expressed in the large cortical pyramidal neurons as compared with the small cell bodies throughout the cortical layers, which may represent nonpyramidal neurons, oligo-, astro-, or microglia cells and which failed to show hybridization signals. Kv9.1 and Kv9.2 mRNAs were also densely distributed throughout most of the amygdala, including the cortical, lateral and basolateral nuclei. Within the thalamus, the medial and lateral habenula showed particularly high levels of Kv9.1 and Kv9.2. The ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus displayed an intense hybridization signal. A distinct laminar expression pattern was observed in the cerebellum (Fig. 3 E). The most intense labeling was detected in the Purkinje and granule cell layers. The molecular layer was weakly labeled except for a few strongly positive cells that are scattered in the cerebellar molecular layer and may be stellate cells and/or basket cells. Large neurons in all deep cerebellar nuclei expressed moderate to high levels of Kv9.1 and Kv9.2 mRNAs. A diffuse expression was observed over most other regions including striatum, globus pallidus of the basal ganglia, substantia nigra, midbrain, and brainstem (pons and medulla). Kv9.1 and Kv9.2 transcripts were also intensely expressed in the rat retina with a distinct stratification pattern. High labeling was apparent in the inner nuclear layer (INL), composed of nuclei of Müller cells and amacrine, bipolar, and horizontal neurons, in the retinal ganglion cell layer (RGC) and in the photoreceptor inner segments (IS) (Fig. 3 F). The spinal cord showed an intense hybridization signal in several neuronal types. This hybridization pattern was similar from the upper cervical to the sacral region.

An increasing number of cysteine-rich antifungal and antimicrobial peptides have been isolated from plants and in particular from plant seed.

Furthermore, a single class of cDNA has been identified that encodes all four members of this family of peptides as part of a preproprotein. Details of the characterization of the unusual structure of this cDNA and its products, as well as of their expression patterns, are presented. Seeds of I. balsamina were purchased from Sandeman Seeds (Pulborough, United Kingdom). Fungi and bacteria were grown and maintained as described previously (14Osborn R.W. De Samblanx G.W.

Sugar); Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (SES A); Trichoderma viride (K1127); andVerticillium alboatrum (K0937). The following Gram-positive bacterial strains were used: Bacillus subtilis (JHCC 55331);Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 9341); Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923); Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212); and the following Gram-negative bacterial strains:Erwinia amylovora (CFBP1430); Escherichia coli(HB101); Proteus vulgaris (JHCC 558711); Pseudomonas solanacearum (R48/a); Xanthomonas campestrispathovarpelargonii (INRA 10342); and Xanthomonas oryzae (ETH 698). The purification of antimicrobial peptides from the basic protein fraction of I. balsamina seed was essentially as described previously (10Terras F.R.G. Schoofs H.M.E. De Bolle M.F.C. Van Leuven F. Rees S.B. Vanderleyden J. Cammue B.P.A. Broekaert W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15301-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One-kilogram amounts of seed were ground in a coffee mill, and protein was extracted by stirring overnight at 4 °C in extraction buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, 15 mmNaH2PO4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7). Ammonium sulfate was added to 80% relative saturation, and precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in distilled water, and extensively dialyzed against distilled water using 2000-Da cutoff dialysis tubing (Sigma). The extract was adjusted to 50 mm NH4Ac (pH 9) and passed over a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (12 × 5 cm, Pharmacia) equilibrated in 50 mm NH4Ac (pH 9). The unbound fraction represents the basic protein fraction, and this was adjusted to pH 6 with acetic acid and passed over a S-Sepharose Fast Flow column (10 × 2.6 cm, Pharmacia) equilibrated in 50 mmNH4Ac (pH 6). Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 50 mm–1.5 m NH4Ac (pH 6) over 325 min at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Proteins were monitored by the on-line measurement of the absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions with the highest antifungal activity were pooled for each peak and further purified by RP-HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: RP-HPLC, reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography; SDS-PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; AMP, antimicrobial peptide; Ib, Impatiens balsamina; SSPE, saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA. on a Pep-S column (C2/C18 silica, 25 × 0.93 cm, Pharmacia). Peptides were eluted with linear gradients of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid to 99.9% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid over 100 min at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Elution of peptides was monitored by absorbance at 210 nm. The purified peptides were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on precast high density gels (PhastSystem, Pharmacia), the sample buffer containing 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.005% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 1% (w/v) dithiothreitol. Peptides were diffusion blotted onto 0.2-μm pore size nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) and visualized by silver staining (16Kovarik A. Hulbinova K. Vrbenska A. Prachar J. Folia Biol. (Prague). 1987; 33: 253-257PubMed Google Scholar). For N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, peptides were reduced and cysteine residues were alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine prior to digestion with either trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) or chymotrypsin (EC3.4.21.1), both from Promega. Following protease digestion, peptide fragments were separated by RP-HPLC (Pep-S column, C2/C18 silica, 25 × 0.93 cm, Pharmacia) and eluted with linear gradients of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid to 99.9% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid over 100 min at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Peptide fragments were subjected to N-terminal sequencing by automated Edman degradation using a 477A Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was performed by M-Scan Ltd. (Ascot, UK) using a PerSeptive Biosystems VoyagerTM Elite Biospectrometry TM Research Station laser-desorption mass spectrometer coupled with Delayed ExtractionTM. Antifungal and antibacterial assays were conducted as described previously (11Terras F.R.G. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Osborn R.W. Vanderleyden J. Cammue B.P.A. Broekaert W.F.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The growth medium for the antifungal assays was either potato dextrose broth (Difco) at 12 g/liter (medium A), or medium A supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 50 mm KCl (medium B). Antibacterial assays were carried out in 1% (w/v) tryptone (Sigma), 0.5% (w/v) low melting point agarose for B. subtilis, Escherichia coli, M. luteus, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus,and Streptococcus faecalis and in 1% (w/v) Bacto-Peptone (Difco), 0.5% (w/v) low melting point agarose for Erwinia amylovora, Pseudomonas solanacearum, X. campestris, and X. oryzae. Magainin I (Sigma) was used as a positive control in the antibacterial assays. Growth in each assay was assessed after the appropriate incubation period (48 h at 24 °C for fungi and 24 h at 28 °C for bacteria). Membrane integrity of cultured human cells was tested on skin muscle diploid fibroblasts using the neutral red uptake method as described previously (10Terras F.R.G. Schoofs H.M.E. De Bolle M.F.C. Van Leuven F. Rees S.B. Vanderleyden J. Cammue B.P.A. Broekaert W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15301-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hemolytic activity was assayed using human blood group A erythrocytes as described previously (10Terras F.R.G. Schoofs H.M.E. De Bolle M.F.C. Van Leuven F. Rees S.B. Vanderleyden J. Cammue B.P.A. Broekaert W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15301-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the erythrocytes were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline instead of 150 mm myo-inositol. Total RNA was purified from dry seed of I. balsamina by grinding in liquid nitrogen, extraction with phenol/cresol and phenol/chloroform, followed by lithium chloride precipitations (17Jepson I. Bray J. Jenkens J. Schuch W. Edwards K. Plant Mol. Biol. Reporter. 1991; 9: 131-138Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+RNA was isolated by a Poly(A)Ttract mRNA Isolation System utilizing magnetic beads (Promega). cDNA was synthesized using a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene) and, following the ligation ofEcoRI linkers and size fractionation on a Sephacryl S-400 column (Pharmacia), a library constructed in λ-ZAP (Stratagene). A DNA probe for screening the cDNA library was generated by performing PCR on the above seed cDNA fractions using a pair of degenerate oligonucleotide PCR primers based on reverse translation of the available amino acid sequence of Ib-AMP1 peptide. The degenerate primers utilized were IbAMP1-C (5′-GITGT/CTGT/CGGITGGGGICC-3′) and IbAMP1-B (5′-CACCAICT/GIACG/ACAG/ATA-3′), where I represents an inosine residue. The resulting 46-base pair PCR product was eluted from an acrylamide gel, purified using a Mermaid Kit (Bio101), and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Random Prime DNA Labeling Kit (Boehringer). The labeled PCR product was used to screen the cDNA library by plaque hybridization, following the transfer of near-confluent plaques to nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham) and the UV cross-linking of DNA. Nonstringent hybridization was performed in 0.25% (w/v) Marvel (Premier Beverages, UK), 5× SSPE (1 × SSPE is 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 mNaH2PO4, 0.001 m EDTA, pH 7.4), 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 35 °C and washing in 6 × SSC followed by 3 × SSC at 42 °C (1 × SSC is 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0). A total of 12 hybridizing plaques were purified and subsequently in vivo excised to generate subclones in pBluescript SK (−) phagemid vectors (Stratagene). Sequencing was performed using a Sequenase kit (United States Biochemical). Nucleotide sequence assembly and analysis was performed using PC/GENE and IG-SUITE Intelligenetics software. Seed representing a range of developmental stages was harvested from glasshouse-grown plants. Developing seed was arbitrarily classified into 5 stages based on morphology and size: stage 1 = white seed, ∼1 mm in diameter; stage 2 = pale green/white, 2 mm; stage 3 = pale green/white dry, 3 mm; stage 4 = gray, dry, 4 mm; and stage 5 = brown seed coat, 3–5 mm. For germination studies, seed were germinated on damp filter paper at 28 °C in the dark, and material was harvested at 24-h intervals. For Northern analysis, total RNA was isolated from seed as described by Jepson et al. (17Jepson I. Bray J. Jenkens J. Schuch W. Edwards K. Plant Mol. Biol. Reporter. 1991; 9: 131-138Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and blotted from a 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel onto Hybond-N membrane (Amersham). Hybridization was performed in 0.25% (w/v) Marvel (Premier Beverages, UK), 5 × SSPE, 0.01% (w/v) SDS at 65 °C and washing in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe used for these studies was a purified DNA fragment representing the full length of the cDNA insert. The signal was detected by autoradiography. For immunoblot analysis, total protein extracts were prepared from seed as described by Terras et al. (1Terras F.R. G Eggermont K. Kovaleva V. Raikhel N.V. Osborn R.W. Kester A. Rees S.B. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Vanderleyden J. Cammue B.P.A. Broekaert W.F. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 573-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Two μg of total protein were electroblotted from a 15% nonreducing SDS-PAGE gel onto 0.2-μm pore size nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) as described (1Terras F.R. G Eggermont K. Kovaleva V. Raikhel N.V. Osborn R.W. Kester A. Rees S.B. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Vanderleyden J. Cammue B.P.A. Broekaert W.F. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 573-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The antiserum used had been raised in rabbits against bovine serum albumin-conjugated Ib-AMP1 peptide. Detection was performed using an enhanced luminescence method (Amersham) as described (1Terras F.R. G Eggermont K. Kovaleva V. Raikhel N.V. Osborn R.W. Kester A. Rees S.B. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Vanderleyden J. Cammue B.P.A. Broekaert W.F. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 573-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The basic proteins from I. balsamina seed were fractionated by cation exchange chromatography, and fractions assayed for antifungal activity against F. culmorum spores. Following chromatography, the extract yielded four peaks of activity eluting between 400 mm and 700 mm NH4Ac (Fig.1, arrowheaded). Fractions from each peak that showed the highest levels of activity were pooled and further purified by preparative RP-HPLC. Each pooled fraction yielded a single peak of absorbance at 210 nm which exactly matched the antifungal activity eluting from the column (data not shown). These active peaks were designated Ib-AMP1, Ib-AMP2, Ib-AMP3, and Ib-AMP4, respectively, according to the order of their elution from the cation exchange column. The purified active fractions were further analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and each was shown to contain a peptide of ∼2–3 kDa (Fig.2). The peptides ran identically whether reduced or unreduced prior to loading on the gels (data not shown), indicating that they are each composed of a single polypeptide chain. Initial attempts to sequence the Ib-AMPs by automated Edman degradation indicated that all four peptides were N-terminally blocked. To obtain their sequences, each peptide was digested with either trypsin or chymotrypsin following modification of cysteine residues with 4-vinylpyridine, and the resulting fragments were purified by RP-HPLC prior to sequencing. The following partial amino acid sequences were generated for peptides Ib-AMP1, Ib-AMP2, Ib-AMP3, and Ib-AMP4, respectively: GRRCCGWGPGRRYCVRWX, GRRCCNxGPGRRYCKRWC, RHRCCAWGPGRKYCKRWC, and GRRCCGWGPGRRYCRRWC. Residue 7 of Ib-AMP2 could not be unambiguously identified as one of the common amino acids. Clearly, all four peptides are very close homologues of each other, with as little as one, and no more than five, amino acid differences between any pairwise alignment of the above sequences. The molecular mass of each of the purified Ib-AMP peptides was experimentally determined by electrospray mass spectrometry as 2464.6, 2527.4, 2536.6, and 2522.6 Da for Ib-AMP1, -2, -3, and -4, respectively (data not shown). These molecular mass determinations are consistent with the estimation based on SDS-PAGE. The antifungal activity of the purified peptides was assessed on 13 fungal strains, many of which are plant pathogens of significant importance to agriculture, using a standard antifungal activity assay (14Osborn R.W. De Samblanx G.W. Thevissen K. Goderis I. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Attenborough S. Rees S.B. Broekaert W.F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In medium A, all four peptides showed similar levels of broad spectrum activity (TableI, medium A). For the majority of the assays in this medium, the IC50 values were <10 μg/ml. The antifungal activity of the peptides is, however, sensitive to the ionic strength of the assay medium and in the same medium supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 50 mm KCl, the activity of Ib-AMP1, Ib-AMP2, and Ib-AMP3 is severely reduced (Table I, medium B). Only Ib-AMP4 maintains any significant inhibitory activity even though its activity is also markedly reduced. On some fungi, notably F. culmorum, the Ib-AMPs cause a very distinct swelling and hyperbranching in the spore germination assay at subinhibitory rates (Fig. 3 A). The Ib-AMPs also inhibit the growth of germlings, and in the case of Ib-AMP4 this is also apparent in medium B (Table I). On germlings, the Ib-AMPs cause swelling and branching along the length of hyphae and at the hyphal tip (Fig. 3 B).Table IAntifungal activity of the Ib-AMP peptidesFungusIC50Ib-AMP1Ib-AMP2Ib-AMP3Ib-AMP4μg/mlMedium A, spores Alternaria longipes31263 Botrytis cinerea122566 Cladosporium sphaerospermum1631 F. culmorum1661 Penicillium digitatum3633 T. viride612126 V. alboatrum31266Medium B, spores Alternaria longipes50>200>20012 Botrytis cinerea>200>200>200200 Cladosporium sphaerospermum50>2001006 F. culmorum50>2001006 Penicillium digitatum200>20010025 T. viride>200>200>200150 V. alboatrum>200>200>20050Medium B, germlings Colletotrichum gloeosporioidesND1-aND, not determined.NDND25 Gloeodes pomigenaNDNDND>100 Gloeosporium solaniNDNDND>100 Nectria galligenaNDNDND6 Phialophora malorumNDNDND6 Sclerotinia sclerotiorumNDNDND25Protein concentrations required for 50% growth inhibition 48 h after addition were determined from dose-response curves.

In addition to their broad spectrum antifungal activity, the Ib-AMPs are also inhibitory to the growth of a range of bacteria, especially Gram-positive bacteria (TableII). On the Gram-positive bacteria tested, the IC50 values of Ib-AMP4 are lower than those obtained with the antibiotic peptide magainin I (18Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The effect of Ib-AMP2 and Ib-AMP4 on human erythrocytes and cell cultures of human skin fibroblasts was investigated. At a concentration of 200 μg/ml, these peptides did not cause lysis of erythrocytes nor did they perturb membrane integrity of the cultured fibroblasts (data not shown). A total of 12 cDNA clones were isolated from the dry seed cDNA library by hybridization, and the insert of the largest clone (Ib22) fully sequenced following in vivo excision of the phagemid. The 1238-base pair DNA sequence of the insert from this clone is presented in Fig. 4 and discussed further below. Approximately 500 base pairs of DNA sequence were obtained for each of the other cDNA clones. Although some clones appeared to be truncated at the 5′ end, the DNA sequence of each was identical to that of clone Ib22 in regions of overlaps, the only differences being apparently due to the exact position of polyadenylation. As indicated in Fig. 4, there appeared to be 5 different polyadenylation sites utilized among the 12 cDNA clones within a region spanning 52 base pairs of the 3′-untranslated region, the majority being at the same position as that of clone Ib22. Clone Ib22 is considerably larger than would be anticipated for a cDNA encoding a single IbAMP peptide. In fact it contains an open reading frame encoding a predicted protein comprising 333 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 37,262 Da. Analysis of this predicted translation product reveals within it the presence of domains that correspond exactly in amino acid sequence to the four antimicrobial peptides described above. Ib-AMP1 is represented three times in consecutive repeats, the other Ib-AMPs once each. The sixboxed regions in Fig. 4 represent, consecutively, Ib-AMP3, Ib-AMP1, Ib-AMP1, Ib-AMP1, Ib-AMP2, and Ib-AMP4. Hydropathy plots and sequence analysis (not shown) of the predicted translation product deriving from clone Ib22 predict a 23-amino acid N-terminal signal sequence, consistent with the fact that many plant antifungal peptides are extracellularly located (1Terras F.R. G Eggermont K. Kovaleva V. Raikhel N.V. Osborn R.W. Kester A. Rees S.B. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Vanderleyden J. Cammue B.P.A. Broekaert W.F. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 573-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The general structure of the predicted translation product and an amino acid alignment of those regions assumed to encode the individual mature peptides are presented in Fig.5. The proprotein domains flanking each Ib-AMP peptide domain vary in length between 16 and 35 amino acids but display some degree of homology with each other, each containing at least five negatively charged amino acids, generally organized as doublets in the vicinity of the presumed cleavage sites (see Fig. 4). This composition is in contrast to the highly basic Ib-AMP domains, which are separated by these proprotein regions. Although there is no clear homology to other peptide sequences or processing sites in the data bases, it is assumed that these regions contain information required for the correct processing of the preproprotein into constituent mature peptides. To investigate the accumulation of Ib-AMP-related transcripts and protein during seed development, both Northern and Western blot analysis was performed on material isolated from developing, dry, and germinating seed. The hybridization pattern resulting from Northern blots probed with the entire insert of clone Ib22 is shown in Fig. 6. There appears to be hybridization to a single class of transcript of ∼1200 nucleotides, which is in accordance with the size predicted from the cDNA sequence analysis of clone Ib22. The pattern of hybridization indicates that the highest accumulation of related transcript is found in dry seed (Fig. 6, lane E) and in the stage of development immediately prior to this (Fig. 6, lane D). Western blots using Ib-AMP1 antibody indicate that immunoreactive material is most abundant in dry seed, from which the Ib-AMPs were originally isolated, and in seed undergoing the early stages of germination (Fig. 7, lanes E, F,and G). There appear to be significant quantities of such material also present in the developmental stage immediately preceding seed dry-down (Fig. 7, lane D). Immunoreactive material migrating at a higher position on the gel (Fig. 7, lane C) may represent unprocessed or incompletely processed precursor protein. An investigation into the processes involved in maturation of the precursor protein is currently under way. Four closely related, small, basic, cysteine-rich peptides have been purified from seed of I. balsamina and shown to be active in vitro against a range of fungal and bacterial species. The majority of the amino acid sequence of the four peptides could be determined experimentally, although complete assignment was prevented because the N terminus of each was blocked. The molecular mass of Ib-AMP1 as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry indicated that the full-length Ib-AMP1 sequence was only 2 amino acids longer at its N terminus than the 18 amino acids assigned by direct amino acid sequencing. It can be predicted that the amino acid residue N-terminally adjacent to the sequenced region must be either a tryptophan or a tyrosine for chymotrypsin to have cleaved Ib-AMP1 in that position. Furthermore, based on the molecular mass estimation and the fact that the peptide is N-terminally blocked, it can be considered likely that the unassigned N-terminal residue is a cyclized glutamine. Both these speculations were indeed confirmed for all four Ib-AMP peptides by the subsequent analysis of the cDNA clone reported here. The molecular mass of each peptide determined experimentally by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight electrospray analysis is consistently ∼21 Da lower than that theoretically predicted for each by direct translation of the gene sequence. This difference is precisely accounted for if it is assumed that the N-terminal glutamine residue of each Ib-AMP peptide is cyclized and that the four internal cysteine residues form two disulfide bridges. The former supposition is supported by the fact that all classes of the Ib-AMP peptides were found to be N-terminally blocked when amino acid sequencing was attempted. The latter is supported by the fact that the native Ib-AMP peptides do not react with Ellman's free thiol reagent. When the theoretical molecular masses for Ib-AMP1, Ib-AMP2, Ib-AMP3, and Ib-AMP4 are adjusted to take into account the N-terminal cyclization and disulfide bridge formation, the respective values of 2464.3, 2527.4, 2536.5, and 2521.4 match the experiment"

Plenum Press, New York1995: 7-67Crossref Google Scholar). The expression of specific sialic acids depends on the species, the tissue, and the developmental stage of the organism (3Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4951) Google Scholar). By virtue of their widespread distribution, their structural versatility, and their peripheral position in glycoconjugates, sialic acids are well suited as molecular determinants of specific biological functions (4Reutter W. Stäsche R. Stehling P. Baum O. Gabius H.-J. Gabius S. Glycosciences: Status and Perspectives. Chapman and Hall, Weinheim1997: 245-259Google Scholar) such as cellular adhesion (5Edelman G.M.

Cancer Res. 1989; 52: 257-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 11Bhavanandan V.P. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), especially in Wilms tumor where they are present as polysialic acid (12Roth J. Zuber C. Wagner P. Taatjes D.J. Weisgerber C. Heitz P.U. Goridis C. Bitter-Suermann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The metastatic and invasive potential of tumor cells is often correlated with the amount of expressed sialic acids (13Dennis J.W. Laferte S. Fukuda M. Dell A. Carver J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Sawada R. Tsuboi S. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1425-1431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the functional role of sialic acids in normal and diseased tissues many efforts have been made to influence the amount of expressed sialic acids by inhibition of sialyltransferases (15Basu S. Basu M. Basu S.S. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 7-67Crossref Google Scholar), and to modulate the structure of sialic acids by the use of synthetic precursor analogs (16Kayser H. Zeitler R. Kannicht C. Grunow D. Nuck R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16934-16938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Keppler O.T. Stehling P. Herrmann M. Kayser H. Grunow D. Reutter W. Pawlita M. J. Biol.

Neu5Ac and CMP-Neu5Ac, its activated form, are biosynthesized in rat liver by five consecutive reactions (18Warren L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier Publishing Co., Amsterdam, London1972: 1097-1126Google Scholar). Recently we found that the two enzymes initiating the biosynthesis of Neu5Ac, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase (UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase, EC 5.1.3.14) and N-acetylmannosamine kinase (ManNAc kinase, EC 2.7.1.60) are parts of one bifunctional enzyme (19Hinderlich S. Stäsche R. Zeitler R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24313-24318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This bifunctional enzyme, the key enzyme of Neu5Ac biosynthesis, was cloned and its cDNA was functionally expressed. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell (Dassel, Germany). Nylon filters for screening, [α-32P]dATP, and [α-35S]dATP were from Amersham (Braunschweig, Germany).N-Acetyl-d-[1-14C]mannosamine and UDP-N-acetyl-d-[U-14C]glucosamine were from ICN (Eschwege, Germany). Peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit antibody was from Dako (Hamburg, Germany). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated swine anti-rabbit antibody was purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). All other chemicals were of the highest available quality and purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany) and Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase was purified from rat liver as described (19Hinderlich S. Stäsche R. Zeitler R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24313-24318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems protein sequencer (model 473A). Peptides were generated by digestion of 20 μg of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase with 2 μg of trypsin in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, at 37 °C for 24 h. Peptides were separated on a reversed phase HPLC column (C18 column LiChro CART CHR D, Merck) with a discontinous gradient of 2 to 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 85 min at 0.4 ml/min, followed by 50 to 95% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 25 min at 0.4 ml/min. Effluent samples showing peaks of absorbance at 215 nm were collected and concentrated to 20 μl before peptide sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from rat liver tissue in an acidic guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform mixture (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription of poly(A)+ RNA with oligo(dT)15 primers was done using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resulting reverse transcripts were used directly for PCR. Primers for PCR were designed from peptide sequences, taking into consideration the rat codon usage frequencies. PCR was performed using sense and antisense primers (125 pmol each) and 1.3 units of Taq DNA polymerase in a reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 1 μg of cDNA. Amplification was carried out by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min using a TwinCycler II thermal cycler (AGS, Heidelberg, Germany). The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified, cloned in pCR II (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) using a T7 sequencing kit from Pharmacia (Freiburg, Germany). The obtained 546-bp PCR product was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dATP by the random priming method (22Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) using a Random Primed DNA Labeling System Kit from Life Technologies, Inc.; 1.2 × 106 clones of a rat liver λ ZAP II cDNA library (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) were screened. Hybridization was performed in buffer of 5 × SSC (1 × SSC, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5 × Denhardt's solution (1 × Denhardt's solution, 0.2% Ficoll 400, 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.2% bovine serum albumin), 0.1% SDS, 200 μg/ml herring sperm DNA at 42 °C. Washes were at the same temperature with 2.0–0.3 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Positive clones were converted to phagemids, consisting of pBluescript II SK− and cDNA insert, by in vivo excision in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue host with R408 helper phage. Plasmids were amplified and the inserted cDNA sequenced. T3, T7, and internal primers generated from the sequence were used for sequencing both strands. Sequence homology analysis was done with GenBank/EMBL and SWISS-PROT data bases using MacMolly software (Soft Gene, Berlin, Germany). UDPGlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase coding cDNA from pBluescript II was subcloned into the eucaryotic expression vector pBK-CMV (Stratagene). COS7 cells were then transiently transfected with this construct using the calcium phosphate method (23Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 152: 456-462Crossref Scopus (6464) Google Scholar). After 20 h, the calcium phosphate precipitate was removed and cells were further cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h and then selected with 600 μg/ml G418. Expression of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase was monitored by immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, and determination of enzyme activity in cell lysates. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on coverslips, fixed in solution containing 3% formaldehyde and permealized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with polyclonal antibody at room temperature. The polyclonal antiserum directed against UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase was obtained by the method of Boulard and Lecroisey (24Boulard C. Lecroisey A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 50: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody and imaged by fluorescence microscopy. Cell lysates of COS7 were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described by Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using 10% acrylamide gels. Separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 12 h in 5% skim milk in buffer A (0.1% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl in 9 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.2) and then incubated for 1 h in a 1/2000 dilution of polyclonal anti-UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase antiserum in buffer A. Detection was performed using a peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit secondary antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit from Amersham. Male Wistar rats were perfused with 20 ml of 150 mm NaCl while the animals were under light ether anesthesia. Organs were removed and transferred to 2 volumes of homogenizing buffer containing 10 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ManNAc, 0.1 mm UDP, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The tissues were homogenized with an Ultraturrax for 1 min at 10,000 rpm. The homogenates were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and ManNAc kinase were assayed as described (19Hinderlich S. Stäsche R. Zeitler R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24313-24318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Tissue distribution was determined by assaying ManNAc kinase in the presence of 5 mm N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to inhibit the ManNAc kinase activity of N-acetylglucosamine kinase (GlcNAc kinase) (26Allen M.B. Walker D.G. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. A rat multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was hybridized with the [α-32P]dATP radiolabeled 546-bp DNA fragment generated by PCR as described above. Hybridization was performed overnight at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4), 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA. The blot was washed four times at 42 °C in 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 10 min and then twice at 50 °C in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 20 min. The bands were visualized by autoradiography. Amino acid sequences of five selected peptides were obtained after tryptic digestion of purified UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase and fractionation of the peptides by reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 2). Sequencing of the NH2 terminus of the 75-kDa polypeptide was without result, suggesting that the NH2 terminus was blocked. The sequences of peptide D and peptide E were used for designing oligonucleotide primers (d, e, a-d, and a-e, where a-d and a-e are the antisense sequences of primers d and e, respectively) for PCR, taking into consideration the rat codon usage (Table I). First, a DNA fragment of 546 bp was amplified from rat liver cDNA with primer e and primer a-d. The 546-bp DNA fragment was cloned in pCR II and then sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the amplified fragment contained a complete match of peptide A.Table IDesign of PCR primersPeptidePrimerAmino acid sequenceDNA sequence “rat codon usage”D LIQEWNSVDL CTGATCCAGGAGTGGAACWSYGTGGAYCTGd CTGATCCAGGAGTGGAAa–d GTTCCACTCCTGGATCAEVGAFGTPVINLGTRGTGGGCGCYTTCGGCACHCCHGTGATCAACCTGGGCACHMGVe GTGATCAACCTGGGCACa–e GTGCCCAGGTTGATCACSense (d and c) and antisense (a-d and a-e) primers for PCR were designed from sequences of peptides D and E, taking into consideration the rat codon usage frequencies. Open table in a new tab Sense (d and c) and antisense (a-d and a-e) primers for PCR were designed from sequences of peptides D and E, taking into consideration the rat codon usage frequencies. The 546-bp DNA fragment was used to screen a cDNA library of rat liver. Eight hybridization positive clones were identified. After plaque purification and rescreening, DNA was prepared from each clone and characterized by restriction analysis. The partial restriction map of the longest cDNA clone, which was designated cDNA EK, is shown in Fig. 1. The additional seven clones had overlapping restriction maps. cDNA EK was chosen for further characterization. PCR primers d, e, a–d, and a–e were used as sequencing primers. Additional primers were constructed from the newly obtained sequence, and the complete cDNA sequence of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase was determined in both directions. The strategy used for deducing the nucleotide sequence is illustrated in Fig. 1. The determined DNA sequence of 2508 bp included the 546-bp long PCR-generated DNA fragment from bp 990 to bp 1536. The sequence of the leading strand is shown in Fig. 2. Examination of the nucleotide sequence showed an open reading frame starting at position 48 and ending at position 2213. The reading frame of 2166 nucleotides encoded 722 amino acids (Fig. 2). The deduced amino acid sequence contained complete matches for all five peptides of the digested UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase. The position of these peptides with respect to the DNA sequence is shown in Fig. 1 and the sequences of these peptides within the 75-kDa polypeptide are shadowed in Fig. 2. The initiation codon ATG is part of a complete consensus motive for eucaryotic translation (28Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′-terminal noncoding region includes the polyadenylation signal (29Wickens M. Stephenson P. Science. 1984; 226: 1045-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) from nucleotide 2497 to nucleotide 2502 (Fig. 2). Two potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites with -Asn-Xaa-Ser- as consensus sequence were identified at amino acid positions 300 and 395, but no glycosyl residues were detected in the purified UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase when assayed by peptide N-glycosidase F digestion and separation of the products by ion exchange chromatography by the method of Nuck et al. (30Nuck R. Zimmermann M. Sauvageot D. Josic D. Reutter W. Glycoconjugate J. 1990; 7: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In addition, no potential transmembrane spanning sequences or signal sequences for glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchoring were detectable, suggesting that UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase is translated on free ribosomes as a cytosolic protein, and therefore has no opportunity to undergo N-glycosylation. Searches of EMBL/GenBank and SWISS-PROT sequence data showed that no identical sequence has been reported so far. In addition, we compared the amino acid sequence of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase with the known sequences of 13 UDP-GlcNAc-binding enzymes, 15 UDP-glucose 4-epimerases, and 12 other epimerases, including the sequence of porcine GlcNAc 2-epimerase (31Maru I. Ohta Y. Murata K. Tsukada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16294-16299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The comparison revealed no similarities which may indicate the localization of the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase domain within the bifunctional enzyme. Comparison with the sequences of several hexokinases (Fig. 3) revealed good matches at positions which are typical for phosphate-binding subdomains in ATPase domains of sugar kinases (Fig. 3) (32Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7290-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). To confirm that UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase is the product of, and can be directly functionally expressed by, the cloned cDNA, cDNA EK was expressed in COS7 cells which were low in detectable UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase activity. The recombinant plasmid pBK:cDNA EK contained the 2.5-kilobase pair cDNA EK fragment between XbaI and XhoI sites of the vector pBK-CMV. COS7 cells were then transfected with pBK:cDNA EK. Transfected cells were found to show an increased intensity of immunofluorescence in the cytosol (Fig.4 a). Immunoblot analysis of the cell lysates of transfected cells with a polyclonal antibody directed against rat liver UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase revealed a polypeptide showing the same mobility as native UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4 b). In cell lysates expressing the 75-kDa polypeptide the activities of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and ManNAc kinase were five times greater than those in cell lysates of either pBK-CMV-containing strains or nontransfected strains of COS7 cells (Fig.4 c). The enzyme activities of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase were determined in the cytosols of 10 different rat tissues. Enzyme activities were only found in liver, salivary glands, and intestinal mucosa, whereas activities of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase in the cytosols of brain, heart, kidney, lung, skeletal muscle, spleen, and testis were below the detectable level (TableII). mRNA analysis was used to determine whether the tissues showing no UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase activity contained even small amounts of the enzyme. Rat mRNA of liver, brain, heart, kidney, lung, skeletal muscle, spleen, and testis were probed at high stringency with the radiolabeled 546-bp DNA fragment. Liver showed a dominant signal at 2500 nucleotides corresponding to the cDNA of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase, but no positive hybridization signal was obtained with the mRNA of the other investigated tissues (Fig.5).Table IIUDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and ManNAc kinase activities of the cytosolic fraction of various tissuesTissuesUDP-GlcNAc 2-epimeraseManNAc kinaseLiver3.1 ± 1.16.5 ± 1.7Salivary glands0.5 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.4Intestinal mucosa0.3 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.2Lung<0.1<0.1Spleen<0.1<0.1Kidney<0.1<0.1Testis<0.1<0.1Brain<0.1<0.1Heart<0.1<0.1Skeletal muscle<0.1<0.1For details see “Experimental Procedures.” Enzyme activities are given as milliunits/mg of protein and are expressed as means ± S.D. for three different experiments. Open table in a new tab For details see “Experimental Procedures.” Enzyme activities are given as milliunits/mg of protein and are expressed as means ± S.D. for three different experiments. Recently we found that the two enzymes initiating the biosynthesis of Neu5Ac (UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and ManNAc kinase) are parts of one bifunctional enzyme (19Hinderlich S. Stäsche R. Zeitler R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24313-24318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Here we present the complete sequence of the cDNA encoding the bifunctional enzyme. The 722 amino acids derived from the open reading frame of the cDNA have a predicted molecular mass in agreement with that of the native enzyme, and contain exact matches of five peptides obtained from tryptic digestion of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase. Expression of the cDNA in COS7 cells resulted in a 75-kDa polypeptide, as well as increased activities of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and ManNAc kinase. We therefore conclude that the cDNA of the 75-kDa polypeptide encodes the bifunctional enzyme UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase. A bifunctional enzyme normally consists of two distinct domains containing separate catalytic sites. As demonstrated for mouse ATP sulfurylase/adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate kinase (33Li H. Deyrup A. Mensch Jr., J.R. Domowicz M. Konstantinidis A.K. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29453-29459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) it is possible to determine these domains from their similarity to known sequences encoding separated enzymes with equal or similar properties. Although we compared the amino acid sequence of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase with several sequences of enzymes using UDP-GlcNAc as a substrate or catalyzing an epimerase reaction, we were not able to determine the localization of the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase domain. Comparison with the ATP-binding domains of hexokinases revealed good matches for two phosphate-binding sites in the COOH-terminal half of the sequence (Fig. 3). The same area also contains a leucine zipper-like motif which participates in dimerization of DNA-binding proteins and membrane proteins (33Li H. Deyrup A. Mensch Jr., J.R. Domowicz M. Konstantinidis A.K. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29453-29459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 34Struhl K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 137-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This motif may be responsible for the higher stability of the dimeric structure that displays ManNAc kinase activity, although no cytosolic protein has yet been reported in which the leucine zipper motif plays a functional role. We therefore assume that the COOH-terminal part of the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase sequence contains the kinase domain. Sialic acids are widely distributed in mammalian tissues and one might assume that sialic acid synthesizing enzymes occur in all tissues containing sialic acids. This assumption is not supported by Northern blot analysis, which failed to detect mRNA for UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase in the examined tissues, in particular in brain, lung, and kidney, which definitely express sialic acids (36Reuter G. Gabius H.J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 325-342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tissues with a low requirement for sialic acids may replenish their sialic acid pool with Neu5Ac from oligosaccharide turnover (2Schauer R. Kelm S. Reuter G. Roggentin P. Shaw L. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 7-67Crossref Google Scholar, 37Saito M. Yu R.K. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 7-67Crossref Google Scholar). Maru et al. (31Maru I. Ohta Y. Murata K. Tsukada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16294-16299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) reported an alternative pathway for the biosynthesis of Neu5Ac, in which ManNAc is directly synthesized from GlcNAc by the action of N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase, which occurs in most rat tissues (38Datta A. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 3363-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). But the activity of ManNAc kinase is directly linked to that of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase by the bifunctionality of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase. In this case GlcNAc kinase, occurring in several rat tissues (39van Rinsum J. van Dijk W. Hooghwinkel G.J.M. Ferwerda W. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), may phosphorylate ManNAc (26Allen M.B. Walker D.G. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A very appropriate method for testing for an alternative pathway of Neu5Ac biosynthesis is to construct a gene knock-out of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase in mouse. The prerequisite for this experiment is given with the results presented here. We thank Eva Guhl for technical assistance and Dr. T. A. Scott for improving the English of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2091783071,"Activation of the somatostatin receptor sst2, a member of the Gi protein-coupled receptor family, results in the stimulation of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity involved in the sst2-mediated growth inhibitory signal. Here, we report that SHP-1, a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase containing two Src homology 2 domains constitutively associated with sst2 as evidence by coprecipitation of SHP-1 protein with sst2, in Chinese hamster ovary cells coexpressing sst2 and SHP-1. Activation of sst2 by somatostatin resulted in a rapid dissociation of SHP-1 from sst2 accompanied by an increase of SHP-1 activity. SHP-1 was phosphorylated on tyrosine in control cells and somatostatin induced a rapid and transient dephosphorylation on tyrosine residues of the enzyme. Stimulation of SHP-1 activity by somatostatin was abolished by pertussis toxin pretreatment of cells. Giα3 was specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-sst2 and anti-SHP-1 antibodies, and somatostatin induced a rapid dissociation of Giα3 from sst2, suggesting that Giα3 may be involved in the sst2·SHP-1 complexes. Finally, somatostatin inhibited the proliferation of cells coexpressing sst2 and SHP-1, and this effect was suppressed in cells coexpressing sst2 and the catalytic inactive SHP-1 (C453S mutant). Our data identify SHP-1 as the tyrosine phosphatase associated with sst2 and demonstrate that this enzyme may be an initial key transducer of the antimitogenic signaling mediated by sst2. Activation of the somatostatin receptor sst2, a member of the Gi protein-coupled receptor family, results in the stimulation of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity involved in the sst2-mediated growth inhibitory signal. Here, we report that SHP-1, a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase containing two Src homology 2 domains constitutively associated with sst2 as evidence by coprecipitation of SHP-1 protein with sst2, in Chinese hamster ovary cells coexpressing sst2 and SHP-1. Activation of sst2 by somatostatin resulted in a rapid dissociation of SHP-1 from sst2 accompanied by an increase of SHP-1 activity. SHP-1 was phosphorylated on tyrosine in control cells and somatostatin induced a rapid and transient dephosphorylation on tyrosine residues of the enzyme. Stimulation of SHP-1 activity by somatostatin was abolished by pertussis toxin pretreatment of cells. Giα3 was specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-sst2 and anti-SHP-1 antibodies, and somatostatin induced a rapid dissociation of Giα3 from sst2, suggesting that Giα3 may be involved in the sst2·SHP-1 complexes.

Somatostatin is a widely distributed inhibitory hormone that exhibits various biological effects, including neurotransmission, inhibition of exocrine and endocrine secretions, and cell proliferation. The diverse biological effects of somatostatin are mediated through somatostatin receptors that are coupled to a variety of signal transduction pathways including adenylate cyclase, ionic conductance channels, and protein phosphatases (1Yamada T.

They belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors and can couple to diverse signal transduction pathways (3Yamada Y. Post S.R. Wang K. Tager H.S. Bell G.I. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The ability of somatostatin and its stable analogues to promote inhibition of normal and tumor cell growth has been known for many years (8Lamberts S.W. Krenning E.P. Reubi J.C. Endocr.

In pancreatic tumor cells, we and others have previously shown that somatostatin and analogues antagonize the mitogenic effect of growth factors acting on tyrosine kinase receptors such as epidermal growth factor (9Liebow C.

Although the molecular events leading to the inhibition of cell proliferation are still poorly understood, it has been shown that, after binding to somatostatin receptors, somatostatin analogues cause a rapid stimulation of a membrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) 1The abbreviations used are: PTPase, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; sst, somatostatin receptor; MEM, modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio] -1-propanesulfonate; SMS, somatostatin analogue SMS 201-995.1The abbreviations used are: PTPase, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; sst, somatostatin receptor; MEM, modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio] -1-propanesulfonate; SMS, somatostatin analogue SMS 201-995.activity and dephosphorylate phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptors (9Liebow C.

Recently, the expression of the sst2 somatostatin receptor subtype in NIH3T3 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells led us to the demonstration of the direct involvement of sst2 in both the antiproliferative effect of somatostatin and its stimulatory effect on PTPase activity (13Buscail L. Delesque N. Estève J.P. Saint L.N. Prats H. Clerc P. Robberecht P. Bell G.I. Liebow C. Schally A.V. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Incubation of cells expressing sst2 with the PTPase inhibitor, vanadate, prevented both effects suggesting that a PTPase may be implicated in the negative growth signal induced by activation of sst2. In addition, we demonstrated that a PTPase of 70 kDa, identified as SHP-1, copurified with membrane somatostatin receptors (15Zeggari M. Estève J.P. Rauly I. Cambillau C. Mazarguil H. Dufresne M.

Saint L.N. Vaysse N. Susini C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 97-104PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that SHP-1 may be a candidate for sst2-mediated early signaling events. SHP-1 (also named SHPTP-1, SHP, or HCP) is a non-transmembrane PTPase that contains two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains involved in its association with multiple signaling molecules (17Shen S.H.

SHP-1 associates in vivo with activated growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor (21Tomic S. Greiser U. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Imyanitov E. Ullrich A. Bohmer F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21277-21284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). SHP-1 has also been shown to associate with activated cytokine receptors, interleukin-3 receptor β chain (22Yi T. Mui A.L. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7577-7586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), erythropoietin receptor (23Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), interferon-α/β receptor (24David M. Chen H.E. Goelz S. Larner A.C. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell.

Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). As a result of these interactions, SHP-1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated by these factors (22Yi T. Mui A.L.

SHP-1 is also tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to activation of G protein-coupled receptors (28Li R.Y. Gaits F. Ragab A. Ragab T.J. Chap H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Rivard N. McKenzie F.R. Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol.

Recent studies have suggested a role of SHP-1 in terminating growth factor mitogenic signals by dephosphorylating critical molecules. SHP-1 dephosphorylates a variety of protein-tyrosine kinase receptors when coexpressed in 293 cells (30Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and has been shown to down-regulate interleukin-3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and mitogenesis in hematopoietic cells (22Yi T. Mui A.L. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7577-7586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Association of SHP-1 with the erythropoietin receptor causes inactivation of Janus kinase 2 and termination of erythropoietin-induced proliferation signal (23Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Similarly, association of SHP-1 with interferon-α/β receptor negatively regulates interferon-α/β-induced Janus kinase 1/Stat1 signaling pathway (24David M. Chen H.E. Goelz S. Larner A.C. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7050-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). SHP-1 has been also implicated as the mediator used by the FcγRIIB1 receptor in B lymphocytes to turn off B cell antigen receptor signaling (25D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The role of SHP-1 in the negative regulation of hematopoiesis is consistent with the various hematopoietic abnormalities and hypersensitivity to growth factors in mice carrying the lethal mutation in the SHP-1 gene that results in motheaten phenotype (31Shultz L.D. Schweitzer P.A. Rajan T.V. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Matthews R.J. Thomas M.L. Beier D.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 1445-1454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 32Tsui H.W. Siminovitch K.A. de, S. L. Tsui F.W. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). If one of the role of SHP-1 is a negative regulation of growth factor signaling, one might therefore speculate that SHP-1 could be activated by factors that negatively regulate cell growth such as somatostatin. In this study, the role of SHP-1 in signal transduction pathway of the G protein-coupled sst2 somatostatin receptor was investigated. Our results provide evidence of physical and functional association of SHP-1 with sst2 and demonstrate that somatostatin is a physiological modulator of SHP-1 that may be required in somatostatin-induced tyrosine phosphatase activation and antiproliferative signals initiated by sst2. SMS 201–995 (SMS) and somatostatin were generous gifts of Dr. C. Bruns (Sandoz, Basel, Switzerland) and Dr. L. Moroder (Munich, Germany), respectively. [Tyr11]somatostatin was purchased from Bachem. [γ-33P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Isotopchim (France). Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) immunodetection system and Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane were from Amersham Corp. Poly(Glu, Tyr), cholesterol hemisuccinate, geneticin (G418), and Sepharose-protein A beads were from Sigma. Minimal essential medium (αMEM), fetal calf serum (FCS), and Lipofectin reagent were from Life Technologies, Inc. CHAPS was from Serva. The 2.1-kilobase HindIII/NotI fragment of mouse SHP-1 cDNA (Dr. M. L. Thomas, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) was subcloned into the expression vector pcDNAneo vector (Invitrogen). CHO (DG44 variant) cells were grown to 50% confluency in 60-mm diameter dishes and were cotransfected using Lipofectin reagent with 1 μg of SHP-1 or SHP-1 (C453S) mutant in pcDNA I neo vector and 3 μg of 1.2-kilobase XbaI fragment of mouse sst2 gene in pCMV6c vector (Dr. G. I. Bell, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL) (3Yamada Y. Post S.R. Wang K. Tager H.S. Bell G.I. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). SHP-1 (C453S) mutant was constructed with the oligonucleotide primer 5′-GAT GCC AGC GCT GGA ATG CAC AAT-3′ by using the method of Kunkel et al. (33Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). The mutation was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Stable colonies obtained by selection with G418 (600 μg/ml) were screened for somatostatin binding using [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin as described below. Cellular clones expressing somatostatin binding sites at a similar level were screened for the presence of SHP-1 or SHP-1 (mutant) using Western blot analysis as described below. Polyclonal anti-sst2 antibodies were generated in rabbits immunized with a peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 191–206 of mouse sst2 as described previously (34Thevéniau M.A. Yasuda K. Bell G.I. Reisine T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The monoclonal anti-SHP-1 antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Medgene, France). Monoclonal antibodies raised against phosphotyrosine (PY-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Tebu, France). Goα1–2, Giα1–2, Giα2, and Giα3 antibodies were from Gramsch Laboratories (Germany). CHO cells and its derivatives were cultured in αMEM containing 10% FCS and G418 (200 μg/ml) as described previously (14Buscail L. Estève J.P. Saint L.N. Bertrand V. Reisine T. O'Carroll A.M.

For cell treatment, cells were plated in 100-mm dishes (106 cells/dish) in αMEM containing 10% FCS, and after an overnight attachment phase, cells were cultured for 24 h, washed, and cultured overnight in serum-free αMEM. Cells were rinsed and then incubated for indicated times in the presence of the somatostatin analogue, SMS, at 1 nm. For cell growth assay, cells were cultured in αMEM containing 10% FCS and plated in 35-mm dishes at 55 × 103 cells/ml (2 ml/dish). After an overnight attachment phase (time 0), cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-free αMEM or in αMEM containing 10% FCS with or without 1 nm SMS. Cell growth was measured at the indicated times by counting cells with a Coulter counter model ZM (Coulter Electronics) as described elsewhere (13Buscail L. Delesque N. Estève J.P. Saint L.N. Prats H. Clerc P. Robberecht P. Bell G.I. Liebow C. Schally A.V. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2315-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). [Tyr11]somatostatin was radioiodinated and purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (14Buscail L. Estève J.P. Saint L.N. Bertrand V. Reisine T. O'Carroll A.M. Bell G.I. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 75-cm2 flasks for 48 h and lysed by freezing in liquid nitrogen in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.3 mg/ml). After thawing, the cell lyzate was centrifuged at 26,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in the same buffer. Binding studies were performed on the resultant crude membranes as described previously (14Buscail L. Estève J.P. Saint L.N. Bertrand V. Reisine T. O'Carroll A.M. Bell G.I. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of membrane proteins were incubated with 30 pm [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin at 25 °C for 90 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.3 mg/ml), bacitracin (0.5 mg/ml), 5 mm MgSO4 (binding buffer). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm somatostatin. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer, and the radioactivity in the pellet was measured. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between the amount of radioactivity bound in the absence and the presence of 1 μm somatostatin. Cells were washed twice and collected in phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, cells were solubilized with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A) in the presence of 1.5% CHAPS and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate. The mixture was gently agitated for 30 min at 4 °C and thereafter centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min. Soluble proteins (300–500 μg) were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with either anti-SHP-1, anti-sst2, anti-G protein antibodies, or preimmune serum prebound to Sepharose-protein A beads prewashed in buffer A. The beads were then washed twice with buffer A and resuspended in either 50 μl of sample buffer for immunoblotting or 180 μl of PTPase buffer for PTPase assay. For immunoblotting, solubilized proteins (90 μg) or immunoprecipitated proteins (see above) were resolved through 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-SHP-1, anti-sst2, anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-G protein antibodies as described previously (35Cambillau C. Rauly I. Sarfati P. Saint L.N. Estève J.P. Fanjul M. Svoboda M. Prats H. Hollande E. Vaysse N. Susini C. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5476-5484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by the ECL immunodetection system and quantified by image analysis using a Biocom apparatus (Biocom, Paris, France). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in PTPase buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (PTPase buffer). The substrate poly(Glu, Tyr) was phosphorylated with [γ-33P]ATP as described elsewhere (13Buscail L. Delesque N. Estève J.P. Saint L.N. Prats H. Clerc P. Robberecht P. Bell G.I. Liebow C. Schally A.V. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2315-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 30,000 cpm of 33P-labeled poly(Glu, Tyr) and allowed to proceed for 10 min at 30 °C as described previously (13Buscail L. Delesque N. Estève J.P. Saint L.N. Prats H. Clerc P. Robberecht P. Bell G.I. Liebow C. Schally A.V. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2315-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). PTPase activity was expressed in picomoles of inorganic phosphate released per min at 30 °C from radiolabeled substrate. Statistical comparison between SMS-treated and nontreated cells was performed using Student's pairedt test. We had previously reported that, in CHO cells expressing sst2 somatostatin receptors, somatostatin analogues stimulated PTPase activity (14Buscail L. Estève J.P. Saint L.N. Bertrand V. Reisine T. O'Carroll A.M. Bell G.I. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in pancreatic cells that highly expressed endogenous sst2, SHP-1 copurified with somatostatin receptors (15Zeggari M. Estève J.P. Rauly I. Cambillau C. Mazarguil H. Dufresne M. Pradayrol L. Chayvialle J.A. Vaysse N. Susini C. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To investigate whether SHP-1 interacts with sst2, we stably coexpressed SHP-1 and sst2 in CHO cells. CHO/sst2-SHP-1 clones expressed sst2 as a protein of 95 kDa detected by immunoblotting as previously reported (34Thevéniau M.A. Yasuda K. Bell G.I. Reisine T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and SHP-1 as a protein of 68 kDa, whereas these proteins were barely detectable in wild CHO cells (Fig. 1). sst2 immunoprecipitates prepared from CHO/sst2-SHP-1 cells were examined by immunoblotting for the presence of SHP-1. As shown in Fig.2, the 68-kDa SHP-1 protein was coprecipitated with the 95-kDa sst2 protein. Similarly, SHP-1 immunoprecipitation resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of SHP-1 and sst2. These protein bands were not seen when immunoprecipitations were performed in the presence of preimmune serum instead of immune serum. Quantification of immunoblots revealed that the amount of sst2 present in the SHP-1 immunoprecipitates (lane ip SHP-1-blot sst2) represents approximately 17–20% of immunoprecipitated sst2 (ip sst2-blot sst2). Taking into account the efficiency of sst2 immunoprecipitation, this represents about 5% of total cellular sst2. From these results, we conclude that SHP-1 physically associates with sst2 and that sst2·SHP-1 complexes are preformed in resting cells.Figure 2Association of SHP-1 with sst2 in CHO/sst2-SHP-1 cells. CHO/sst2-SHP-1 cells (106cells/dish) were cultured for 24 h in αMEM containing 10% FCS and solubilized with 1.5% CHAPS. Soluble proteins were immunoprecipitated (ip) with either anti-sst2 (sst2) or anti-SHP-1 (SHP-1) antibodies. Immune complexes were fractionated by a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and subjected to sequential immunoblotting (blot) with anti-sst2 or anti-SHP-1 antibodies or preimmune serum (PI).Arrows indicate the position of sst2 and SHP-1. Size markers (kDa) are indicated to the left of the immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the interaction of SHP-1 with sst2 was affected by somatostatin treatment, CHO/sst2-SHP-1 cells were incubated in the presence of the somatostatin analogue, SMS, for various times prior to solubilization and immunoprecipitation with anti-sst2 antibodies. The amount of SHP-1 associated with sst2 was then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-SHP-1 antibodies and the blots were reprobed with anti-sst2 antibodies to ensure that comparable amounts of sst2 molecules were immunoprecipitated at each time point of SMS treatment. As observed in Fig. 3, somatostatin treatment resulted in a transient increase of the amount of SHP-1 immunoprecipitated with anti-sst2 antibodies within the first 30 s after which the rate of immunodetected SHP-1 in sst2 immunoprecipitates decreased, about 80% of the preformed sst2·SHP-1 complexes being dissociated after 10 min of SMS treatment. Similarly, the amount of immunodetected sst2 in SHP-1 immunoprecipitates was decreased by 60 ± 6% following SMS treatment of cells for 3 min. We further investigated the effect of SMS on SHP-1 activity in CHO/sst2-SHP-1 cells. Cells were incubated in the presence of 1 nm SMS for various times, after which they were solubilized, and SHP-1 activity was measured in SHP-1 immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 4, SHP-1 activity was increased upon treatment with SMS. The stimulation of SHP-1 activity was maximal after 30 s of SMS treatment and slightly declined up to 10 min. We then examined the effect of SMS treatment on the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1. SMS-treated or untreated cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-SHP-1 antibodies and immunoblotted with either anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-SHP-1 antibodies. The immunoblot revealed that SHP-1 was tyrosine phosphorylated in untreated cells and that SMS induced a rapid and transient dephosphorylation of SHP-1 (Fig. 5). The dephosphorylation of SHP-1 was observed as early as 30 s after SMS treatment, was maximal at 1 min and declined subsequently until control levels. All these results indicate that SMS induced a transient increase and a subsequent dissociation of preformed sst2·SHP-1 complexes, which was associated with the stimulation and the transient dephosphorylation of the enzyme. In CHO cells expressing sst2, we previously reported that stimulation of PTPase activity by somatostatin was suppressed by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin indicating that a pertussis toxin sensitive G protein was involved in this effect (13Buscail L. Delesque N. Estève J.P. Saint L.N. Prats H. Clerc P. Robberecht P. Bell G.I. Liebow C. Schally A.V. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2315-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in these cells, sst2 has been demonstrated to be coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, Giα3 and Goα2, but not to Giα1 and Giα2 (36Law S.F. Yasuda K. Bell G.I. Reisine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10721-10727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation of CHO/sst2-SHP-1 cells with pertussis toxin for 18 h at 100 ng/ml abolished the stimulatory effect of SMS on SHP-1 activity in SHP-1 immunoprecipitates (not shown) suggesting that sst2-coupled activation of SHP-1 was mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. To identify the G protein involved in the sst2·SHP-1 complexes, SHP-1 and sst2 immunoprecipitates from CHO/sst2-SHP-1 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies directed against Giα1, 2, 3 and Goα1–2 subunits. Giα3 was immunoprecipitated with anti-sst2 antibodies as well as anti-SHP-1 antibodies, suggesting that Giα3 was present in the sst2·SHP-1 complexes. In contrast, Giα1, Giα2, and Goα were never detected in the sst2·SHP-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6). In addition PTPase activity can be immunoprecipitated by anti-Giα3 antibodies but not by Goαantibodies (not shown). All these results argue in favor of a role for Giα3 in the formation of the sst2·SHP-1 complexes. To investigate whether the association of Giα3 with sst2 can be modified by somatostatin, CHO/sst2-SHP-1 cells were treated for various times with 1 nm SMS and Giα3 was identified in sst2 and SHP-1 immunoprecipitates. As observed in Fig. 6, SMS treatment induced a transient increase at 30 s of the amount of Giα3 immunoprecipitated either by anti-sst2 or anti-SHP-1 antibodies which was followed by a rapid decrease of the amount of immunodetected Giα3. Only 30% of sst2-associated Giα3 was detected after 10 min of SMS treatment. The time course of Giα3 dissociation from sst2 and SHP-1 paralleled that of dissociation of SHP-1 from sst2, suggesting that these events can be linked. To obtain direct evidence of the role of SHP-1 in the inhibitory effect of somatostatin on cell proliferation, we generated a catalytically inactive SHP-1 by introducing a point mutation into the conserved catalytic residue, cysteine 453, which is crucial for catalytic activity of the enzyme. Cys453 was mutated to Ser. This mutation completely abolished the phosphatase activity of the SHP-1 mutant transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. 2C. Nahmias, unpublished results. We stably coexpressed the SHP-1 mutant and sst2 in CHO cells and we selected clones (CHO/sst2-SHP-1(C453S)) that expressed the two proteins at a similar level with that observed in CHO/sst2-SHP-1 cells as demonstrated by immunoblotting (Fig. 7).

Immunoblotting studies showed that the cloned RyR3 was indistinguishable from the native mammalian RyR3 in molecular size and immunoreactivity. Ca2+ release measurements using the fluorescence Ca2+ indicator fluo 3 revealed that the cloned RyR3 functioned as a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+release channel in HEK293 cells. Functional properties of the cloned RyR3 were further characterized by using single channel recordings in lipid bilayers. The cloned RyR3 channel exhibited a K+conductance of 777 picosiemens in 250 mm KCl and a Ca2+ conductance of 137 picosiemens in 250 mmCaCl2 and displayed apCa2+/pK+ ratio of 6.3 and an open time constant of about 1.16 ms. The response of the cloned RyR3 to cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations was biphasic. The channel was activated by Ca2+ at about 100 nmand inactivated at about 10 mm. Ca2+ alone was able to activate the cloned RyR3 fully. Calmodulin activated the cloned RyR3 at low Ca2+ concentrations but inhibited the channel at high Ca2+ concentrations. The cloned RyR3 was activated by ATP, caffeine, and perchlorate, inhibited by Mg2+ and ruthenium red, and modified by ryanodine. Cyclic ADP-ribose did not seem to affect single channel activity of the cloned RyR3. The most prominent differences of the cloned RyR3 from the rabbit skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor were in the gating kinetics, extent of maximal activation by Ca2+, and sensitivity to Ca2+ inactivation.

Results of the present study provide initial insights into the single channel properties of the mammalian RyR3. Ryanodine receptors are a family of intracellular Ca2+release channels that were originally identified in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; RyR, ryanodine receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; cADPr, cyclic ADP-ribose; pS, picosiemens; CaM, calmodulin. of striated muscles. To date, three members of this family have been identified in mammalian tissues, namely the skeletal muscle (RyR1), the cardiac muscle (RyR2), and the brain (RyR3) ryanodine receptor. These proteins are the products of different genes and share 66–70% amino acid sequence identity (1McPherson P.S. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13765-13768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 3Coronado R. Morrissette J.

Earlier studies using RNA blot analysis revealed that the expression patterns of these isoforms were very different (6Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). RyR1 was predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, whereas RyR2 was mainly expressed in heart and brain. The expression of RyR3 was detected in smooth muscle tissues and certain regions of the brain. However, results of recent ribonuclease protection assay demonstrate that all three RyR isoforms are widely and differentially expressed (7Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). These studies also indicate that most tissues express more than one RyR isoform. For example, skeletal muscles express both RyR1 and RyR3, although RyR3 is expressed at a much lower level than that of RyR1. The function and regulation of RyR1 and RyR2 have been extensively studied. They function as Ca2+ release channels of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and play an essential role in excitation-contraction coupling in striated muscles (1McPherson P.S. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13765-13768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 3Coronado R. Morrissette J.

Both RyR1 and RyR2 have been purified and characterized. The single channel properties of RyR1 and RyR2 that have been incorporated into lipid bilayers are very similar. They both form a large conductance channel permeable to monovalent and divalent cations and can be activated by submicromolar Ca2+, ATP, and caffeine and inhibited by millimolar Ca2+, Mg2+, and ruthenium red. Ryanodine, a plant alkaloid, locks both channels in a subconductance state. However, differences in sensitivities to Ca2+activation, Ca2+ inactivation, and Mg2+inhibition have been reported (8Rousseau E. Smith J.S. Henderson J.S. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1986; 50: 1009-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 9Meissner G. Henderson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3065-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chu A.

Physiol. 1994; 266: C1729-C1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have also been observed. On the other hand, little is known about the physiological role, regulation, and channel properties of the RyR3 isoform (5Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Isolation and biochemical and biophysical characterization of RyR3 have been impeded by its low abundance and its coexpression with other RyR isoforms. Biochemical studies and single channel recordings of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channels isolated from brain and smooth muscle tissues have been reported (15Herrmann-Frank A. Darling E. Meissner G. Pfluegers Arch. 1991; 418: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16McPherson P.S. Kim Y.K. Valdivia H. Knudson C.M. Takekura H. Franzini-Armstrong C. Coronado R.

A. 1994; 91: 3294-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is, however, uncertain whether the observed properties correspond to those of the RyR3 isoform, since these tissues are known to express RyR3 as well as RyR2 and/or RyR1. Recently, Murayama and Ogawa (18Murayama R. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were able to purify the rabbit brain RyR3 by using an RyR3-specific antibody. They demonstrated that the immunoprecipitated RyR3 was capable of binding [3H]ryanodine in a Ca2+-dependent and caffeine-sensitive manner (18Murayama R. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, channel properties of the purified RyR3 have not been characterized. Significant progress in understanding the function and regulation of RyR3 has recently been made through the generation of mice with a null mutation in the ryr1 gene (19Takeshima H. Iino M. Takekura H. Nishi M. Kuno J. Minowa O. Takano H. Noda T. Nature. 1994; 369: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscles isolated from these mutant mice lack RyR1 and RyR2 but contain RyR3, thus providing a valuable system to study RyR3. Analysis of SR Ca2+ release in these mutant muscles suggests that RyR3 is modulated by Ca2+, adenine nucleotide, caffeine, and ryanodine (20Takeshima H. Yamazawa T. Ikemoto T. Takekura H. Nishi M. Noda T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2999-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). More recently, a mutant mouse lacking RyR3 has also been generated (21Takeshima H. Ikemoto T. Nishi M. Nishiyama N. Shimuta M. Sugitani Y. Kuno J. Saito I. Saito H. Endo M. Iino M. Noda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19649-19652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Ca2+ release studies have shown that SR Ca2+ release in the RyR1-deficient muscle (or RyR3 containing muscle) was much less sensitive to Ca2+activation than that in the RyR3-deficient muscle (or RyR1 containing muscle). Based on these data, it was suggested that RyR3 may function as a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release channel with a high threshold in mammalian skeletal muscles (21Takeshima H. Ikemoto T. Nishi M. Nishiyama N. Shimuta M. Sugitani Y. Kuno J. Saito I. Saito H. Endo M. Iino M. Noda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19649-19652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It remains, however, to be determined whether the intrinsic sensitivity of the RyR3 channel to Ca2+ activation differs from that of the RyR1 channel. To gain insights into the Ca2+ sensitivity, ligand gating properties, and single channel characteristics of RyR3, we have cloned the RyR3 cDNA from rabbit uterus and expressed the cDNA in HEK293 cells. The CHAPS-solubilized and sucrose gradient-purified cloned RyR3 was characterized by using single channel recordings in planar lipid bilayers. Our results demonstrate that the cloned RyR3 single channel is modulated by caffeine, ryanodine, and other physiological and pharmacological ligands. The sensitivity of the cloned RyR3 to Ca2+ activation was found to be similar to that of RyR1. However, the cloned RyR3 differs from RyR1 in the gating behavior, the extent of maximal activation by Ca2+, and the sensitivity to Ca2+ inactivation. Restriction endonucleases and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, Life Technologies Inc., and Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Ryanodine was obtained from Agri Systems International (Wind Gap, PA). Soybean phosphatidylcholine, brain phosphatidylethanolamine, and brain phosphatidylserine were from Avanti Polar Lipids. Calmodulin was obtained from Calbiochem. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody was purchased from Promega Biotech. Rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Prestained protein standards were purchased from Bio-Rad. Cyclic ADP-ribose, CHAPS, and other chemicals were from Sigma. Total RNA from rabbit uterus, isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63222) Google Scholar), was used to purify poly(A)+ RNA using the mRNA Purification Kit (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was prepared from mRNA (10 μg) using the SuperScript Preamplification System (Life Technologies Inc.) with random primers and was resuspended in 150 μl of H2O. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were carried out in a 50-μl solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2.0 mmMgS04, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 ng of each DNA primer, 200 μm concentration of each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase, and 1.0–2.0 μl of first strand cDNA. The DNA was denatured for 3 min at 94 °C followed by 25–30 cycles of amplification. Each cycle consists of 45 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 46–53 °C, and 4 min at 72 °C. An additional extension for 5 min at 72 °C was performed after the final cycle. The annealing temperature and the number of cycles for each pair of primers were determined empirically. The entire 15-kilobase pair coding region of the RyR3 mRNA from rabbit uterus was amplified by PCR using 16 pairs of primers (TableI and Fig. 1). PCR primers were synthesized based on the reported brain RyR3 cDNA sequence (6Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). A 5′-flanking BamHI restriction site is included in primers CP-1F, CP-1R, CP-2F, CP-2R, CP-3F, CP-3R, CP-5F, CP-5R, CP-7F, CP-7R, FP-6F, and FP-8F, whereas a 5′-flanking EcoRI site is included in primers CP-4F, CP-4R, CP-6F, CP-6R, and FP-6R. Primers CP-8F and CP-8R each contain a 5′-flanking XbaI site. CP-1F also contains a 5′-flanking NheI site downstream of theBamHI. Mutations that did not change amino acid sequence were introduced in overlapping PCR primers CP-1R and CP-2F, CP-2R and CP-3F, and CP-5R and CP-6F to generate three unique restriction sitesXhoI, SalI, and SmaI in the RyR3 cDNA.Table ISequences of PCR primersNameSequencePCR productCP-1F5′-ACTGGATCCAGCTAGCAGCCATGGCCGAAGGCGGAGA-3′PCR1CP-1R5′-ACTGGATCCTCGAGTCTGTCCAATTTACTGATAAGC-3′CP-2F5′-ACTGGATCCTCGAGTCTTCCTCAGGTATCCTGGA-3′PCR2aSP2–2R5′-TTCAGCCAGCCTGTCTC-3′SP2–2F5′-GCATCTCCTTCCGCATC-3′PCR2bCP-2R5′-ACTGGATCCATGTCAGGTCGACAGCCTGGCCT-3′CP-3F5′-ACTGGATCCAAGGCTGTCGACCTGACATTGAGCT-3′PCR3aSP3–2R5′-ACCGGGTTCTTCTCTTCAC-3′SP3–1F5′-GCAACGTGGACCTGGAG-3′PCR3bCP-3R5′-ACTGGATCCGCCAAACACAGAGGGATCGATGA-3′CP-4F5′-ACTGAATTCCCTCCTCATCGATCCCTCTGTGT-3′PCR4aSP4–2R5′-CTCCAGCAGGTAACTCAG-3′SP4–3F5′-ACCAGCATCCCAACCTC-3′PCR4bFP-6R5′-CAGGAATTCTCAGCCCATGTGCACAATCTCTTCT-3′FP-6F5′-CTGGGATCCAGGGTGCCATTAAAATCTCCG-3′PCR4cCP-4R5′-ACTGAATTCAGAATCGATCAGAGAGGTGTAGTGT-3′CP-5F5′-ACTGGATCCTGATCGATTCTACACTGCAGACAA-3′PCR5aSP5–2R5′-GAAGGCATCCAGCTCCAT-3′FP-8F5′-CTGGGATCCAGAGGACCAAAGAGGGTGAAGC-3′PCR5bCP-5R5′-ACTGGATCCCGGGGAGTTTTGGTGTTGAAGACT-3′CP-6F5′-ACTGAATTCCCGGGAAAGGTCTATTCTGGGGATG-3′PCR6aSP6–1R5′-CCGCTCCTGGTCCTGT-3′SP6–2F5′-ACCAACTCTTCCGCATG-3′PCR6bCP-6R5′-ACTGAATTCAGCCAAATCCTGTACTAGTTTCTCT-3′CP-7F5′-ACTGGATCCAAGAGAAACTAGTACAGGATTTGGCT-3′PCR7aSP7–1R5′-GTGAACTCATCATTCTGG-3′SP7–1F5′-GCCGAGATGGTCCTTCA-3′PCR7bSP7–4R5′-TCCATGGCCTTCTGGAATTC-3′SP7–4F5′-TTAACCAGCTCAGATAC-3′PCR7cCP-7R5′-ACTGGATCCTGCACTAGTTCAGTCGTGATGCCT-3′CP-8F5′-CAGTCTAGAAGGGGCAAAGAACATCAGAGTGACT-3′PCR8CP-8R5′-GTCTCTAGACCAGTGTCGTGCTGTAGCTTTCAC-3′FP-8F5′-CTGGGATCCAGAGGACCAAAGAGGGTGAAGC-3′FP-8FP-8R5′-CAGGAATTCTCATTCTCTGGAGAGCACAACGTTTG-3′FP-11F5′-GTCGGATCCAGGCAGCAGAGACGAAG-3′FP-11FF-11R5′-CAGGAATTCTCATCGCTCCTCTTCTTTGGCT-3′ Open table in a new tab These primers were used to generate 16 PCR fragments PCR1, PCR2a, PCR2b, PCR3a, PCR3b, PCR4a, PCR4b, PCR4c, PCR5a, PCR5b, PCR6a, PCR6b, PCR7a, PCR7b, PCR7c, and PCR8 (Table I and Fig. 1). These PCR fragments were subcloned into plasmid pBluescript. Individual clones of each PCR fragment were analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing analysis by the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method (23Sanger F. Nicklen S.

All recombinant DNA manipulations were carried out using standard procedures (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual.

Subfragments PCR2a and PCR2b, PCR3a and PCR3b, PCR4a, PCR4b and PCR4c, PCR5a and PCR5b, PCR6a and PCR6b, PCR7a, PCR7b, and PCR7c were joined together to form PCR2, PCR3, PCR4, PCR5, PCR6, PCR7, respectively (Fig. 1). PCR1 and PCR2, PCR3 and PCR5, and PCR6 and PCR8 were then connected together to yield PCR1,2, PCR3,5, and PCR6,8, respectively. These three fragments were then ligated together sequentially to form PCR1–3,5,6,8 (Fig. 1). PCR4 was ligated with PCR1–3,5,6,8 to form PCR1–6,8 which was subsequently subcloned into another plasmid pBlueBac4 (Invitrogen) to yield PCR1–6,8 (pBB4). The final gap was filled by ligating PCR7 with PCR1–6,8 to form pRyR3 (pBB4) (Fig. 1). Finally, the full-length RyR3 cDNA from pRyR3 (pBB4) (Fig. 1) was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to form pRyR3. Anti-FP8 and anti-FP11 antibodies were raised in rabbits against short sequences of the rabbit RyR3 in the form of GST fusion proteins. Oligodeoxynucleotides with a 5′-flanking BamHI restriction site for the forward primers (FP-8F and FP-11F) and 5′-flankingEcoRI restriction site and a stop codon for the reverse primers (FP-8R and FP-11R) were synthesized (Table I). Primers, FP-8F and FP-8R, were used to synthesize the DNA fragment encoding amino acids 2690–2734 of the rabbit RyR3 by PCR using PCR5b as DNA template. Primers, FP-11F and FP-11R, were used to synthesize the DNA fragment encoding amino acids 4328–4363 of RyR3 by PCR using PCR8 fragment as DNA template. PCR products were digested with BamHI andEcoRI, purified, and ligated into theBamHI/EcoRI sites in the polylinker in pGEX-3X to form pFP8 and pFP11. The sequences of pFP8 and pFP11 were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression and isolation of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein FP8 and FP11 were carried out according to the standard protocols from Pharmacia. Rabbits were immunized subcutaneously with 200 μg of affinity purified FP8 or FP11 in complete Freund's adjuvant, and booster injections of the same amount in incomplete Freund's adjuvant were given at 17–19-day intervals. Antiserum was collected 2 weeks after each booster injection. GST protein and FP8 and FP11 fusion proteins were immobilized to separate Affi-Gel 15 columns (Bio-Rad) according to the standard protocol from Bio-Rad. Antiserum was first absorbed on the GST column. Absorbed antiserum was then loaded onto the FP8 or FP11 column, washed, and eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, and neutralized with 0.2 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Affinity purified antibodies were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and concentrated in a Centricon-10 concentrator (Amicon). HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1 mm minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids, 4 mml-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 mg of streptomycin/ml, 4.5 g of glucose/liter, and 10% fetal calf serum, at 37 °C under 5% CO2. DNA transfection was carried out using calcium phosphate (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes 20–22 h before transfection and were transfected with 8 μg of pRyR3 per dish. Control cells were treated in the same way either with no DNA or with only the expression vector DNA. Coverslips were placed in a 100-mm tissue culture dish. Cell culture and DNA transfection were then carried out as described above. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the coverslips were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, and washed once with PBS and three times with PBS containing 0.1% saponin 5 min each time. The coverslips were blocked with buffer A (2% skim milk powder, 0.1% saponin in PBS) for 30 min before washing and incubating with anti-FP11 antibody in buffer A for 1 to 2 h. The coverslips were washed with buffer A and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG in buffer A for 30–60 min. The coverslips were then washed, mounted in 95% glycerol, and analyzed with the Leica DMRB photomicroscope using a 63 × objective. Free cytosolic Ca2+ in transfected and non-transfected HEK293 cells was measured with the fluorescence Ca2+ indicator dye fluo 3 (26Minta A. Kao J.P.Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8171-8178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grown for 24 h after transfection were washed three times with KRH buffer without MgCl2 and CaCl2(KRH buffer: 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 6 mmglucose, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and incubated in the same buffer at 37 °C for 30–60 min. After being detached from culture dishes by pipetting, cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 2 min in a Beckman TH-4 rotor. Cell pellets were washed twice with KRH buffer and loaded with 10 μm fluo 3 in KRH buffer plus 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 250 μm sulfinpyasone at room temperature for 30 min, followed by washing with KRH buffer three times and resuspended in KRH buffer plus 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 250 μm sulfinpyasone. Aliquot of 100–150 μl of fluo 3 loaded cells was added to 2 ml (final volume) KRH buffer in a cuvette. Fluorescence intensity of fluo 3 at 530 nm was measured in an SLM-Aminco series 2 luminescence spectrometer with 480 nm excitation at 25 °C (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL). Heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum was isolated from bovine diaphragm or rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle according to the method described by Campbell and MacLennan (27Campbell K.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4626-4632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomal membranes were prepared from transfected and non-transfected HEK293 cells as described previously (28Chen S.R.W. Vaughan D.M. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells grown for 28 h after transfection on 100-mm tissue culture dishes were washed twice with 3 ml of PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and incubated in the same solution for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were detached from dishes by gentle pipetting and collected by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 2 min in a Beckman TH-4 rotor. Cell pellets were suspended in a solution containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and a protease inhibitor mix (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2.5 mmdithiothreitol) and incubated on ice for 20–30 min. Cells were homogenized in a glass Dounce homogenizer for 50 strokes with pestle A. An equal volume of a solution containing 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.5 m sucrose, 0.3 m KCl, 100 μm CaCl2, and the protease inhibitor mix was added to the homogenate and homogenized for 35 strokes. The homogenate was centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 20 min in a Beckman JA-20 rotor at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 37,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti70 rotor for 60 min. The pellets were suspended in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, and the protease inhibitor mix and solubilized by 1.5% (final concentration) CHAPS in a final volume of 2.5 ml and a final membrane protein concentration of 2 mg/ml for 1 h on ice. The suspension was spun at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti75 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C, and 2.5 ml of the supernatant was layered on top of a 10.5-ml (7.5–25%, w/w) linear sucrose gradient containing 25 mmTris-Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3% CHAPS, and 0.17% phosphatidylcholine. The tubes were centrifuged at 28,500 rpm in a Beckman SW-41 rotor for 17–18 h at 4 °C. Fractions of 0.7 ml each were collected and monitored for immunoreactivity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described below. The peak fractions of immunoreactivity were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Aliquots of 50 μl of the sucrose density gradient fractions were added to microtiter wells containing 150 μl of 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The microtiter plate was incubated at 4 °C for 18 h and then blocked with 5% skim milk powder in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was washed 8–10 times with cold tap water and incubated with anti-FP11 in PBS solution containing 5% milk powder and 0.1% saponin for 2–4 h, washed again, and allowed to react with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. The samples were again washed, and bound antibodies were quantified by the alkaline phosphatase reaction in diethanolamine buffer containing 10% diethanolamine, pH 9.8, 5 mm MgCl2, and one phosphatase substrate tablet (Sigma) per 5 ml of diethanolamine buffer. Microsomal membranes and sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer at 100 °C for 2 min and separated in 5% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207461) Google Scholar). The resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 20 V for 15–16 h at 4 °C in the presence of 0.01% SDS according to Towbinet al. (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44931) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 1 h with PBS plus 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk powder, incubated 2–4 h with anti-FP8 antibody in the same solution, and then washed three times for 15 min each with the same buffer. The bound antibodies were visualized by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting analysis system from Amersham Corp. Single channel recordings were carried out using CHAPS-solubilized and sucrose density gradient-purified ryanodine receptors from either rabbit skeletal muscle heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum or from transfected HEK293 cells as described previously (28Chen S.R.W. Vaughan D.M. Coronado R. MacLennan D.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Brain phosphatidylserine and brain phosphatidylethanolamine, dissolved in chloroform, were combined in a 3:5 ratio (w/w), dried under nitrogen gas, and suspended in 30 μl ofn-decane at a concentration of 35 mg of lipid/ml. Bilayers were formed across a 250-μm hole in a Delrin partition separating two chambers. The trans chamber (500 μl) was connected to the head stage input of an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc.). The cis chamber (1.2 ml) was held at virtual ground. A symmetrical solution containing 250 mm KCl and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, was used for recordings. A 12-μl aliquot of the sucrose density gradient-purified cloned RyR3 or a 4-μl aliquot of the sucrose density gradient-purified native rabbit skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor was added to the cischamber. Unless indicated otherwise, spontaneous channel activity was tested for sensitivity to EGTA and/or Ca2+, thereby providing information about Ca2+ sensitivity, orientation in the bilayer, and stability of the incorporated channel. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using the computer program of Fabiato and Fabiato (31Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. ( Paris ). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). All subsequent additions were made to that chamber in which the addition of EGTA inhibited the activity of the incorporated channel. This chamber presumably corresponds to the cytoplasmic side of the Ca2+ release channel. Recordings were filtered at 1500 Hz using a low-pass Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA), digitized at 20 kHz, and recorded on optical disk cartridges. The data were analyzed using pClamp 6.0.3 software (Axon Instruments Inc.). To obtain the full-length RyR3 cDNA for expression and functional studies, we employed reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify the entire coding sequence of the RyR3 cDNA from rabbit uterus. Sixteen overlapping cDNA fragments were obtained and sequenced (Fig. 1). The deduced amino acid sequence of the rabbit uterus RyR3 cDNA is identical to that of the rabbit brain RyR3 cDNA repo"
https://openalex.org/W2029861067,"Long chain and short chain curaremimetic toxins from snakes possess 66–74 residues with five disulfide bonds and 60–62 residues with four disulfide bonds, respectively. Despite their structural differences all of these toxins bind with high affinity to the peripheral nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR). Binding experiments have now revealed that long chain toxins only, like the neuronal κ-bungarotoxin, have a high affinity for a chimeric form of the neuronal α7 receptor, with K d values ranging from about 1 to 12 nm. In contrast, all other toxins bind to the chimeric α7 receptor with a low affinity, withK d values ranging between 3 and 22 μm. These results are supported by electrophysiological recordings on both the wild-type and chimeric α7 receptors. Amino acid sequence analyses have suggested that high affinities for the neuronal receptor are associated with the presence of the fifth disulfide at the tip of the toxin second loop. In agreement with this conclusion, we show that a long chain toxin whose fifth disulfide is reduced and then dithiopyridylated has a low affinity (K d = 12 μm) for the neuronal α7 receptor, whereas it retains a high affinity (K d = 0.35 nm) for the peripheral AChR. Thus, a long chain curaremimetic toxin having a reduced fifth disulfide bond behaves like a short chain toxin toward both the peripheral and neuronal AChR. Therefore, functional classification of toxins that bind to AChRs should probably be done by considering their activities on both peripheral and neuronal receptors. Long chain and short chain curaremimetic toxins from snakes possess 66–74 residues with five disulfide bonds and 60–62 residues with four disulfide bonds, respectively.

Animal venoms produce a wide diversity of toxins that bind to a variety of different receptors, ion channels, and enzymes. Thus, they block some physiological pathways of prey and/or predators that, as a result, are usually rapidly immobilized and often killed. In addition, however, animal toxins are capable of exerting more subtle activities. For example, mamba venoms contain an unexpectedly large number of muscarinic toxins that exert a spectrum of fine activities toward a diversity of muscarinic receptor subtypes, acting on them as agonists or antagonists (1Jerusalinsky D. Harvey A.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 424-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Certainly, identification of subtle pharmacological activities constitutes a real challenge in the domain of toxin discovery. In this respect, the well known snake curaremimetic toxins and their current classification as long chain and short chain toxins constitute a most puzzling situation. These monomeric toxins possess 66–74 residues with five disulfide bonds and 60–62 residues with four disulfide bonds, respectively (2Endo T. Tamiya N. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 259-302Google Scholar). Well known prototypes of long chain and short chain toxins are, respectively, α-bungarotoxin (Bgtx) 1The abbreviations used are: Bgtx, bungarotoxin; AChR, acetylcholine receptor; Cbtx, cobratoxin; Ea and Eb, erabutoxin a and b, respectively; HEK, human embryonal kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. from venom of the krait Bungarus multicinctus (3Chiapinelli V.A. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 223-258Google Scholar) and toxin α from the African cobra Naja nigricollis (4Eaker D. Porath J. J.

Changeux J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of long chain and short chain toxins can be aligned readily, using four invariant half-cystines (2Endo T. Tamiya N. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 259-302Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, therefore, x-ray crystallographic studies and NMR analyses (7Love R.A. Stroud R.M. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 8Low B.W. Corfield P.W.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Tsernoglou D.

Roumestand C. Gilquin B. Bontems F. Ménez A. Toma F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11335-11347Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the polypeptide chains of both types of toxins adopt the same overall fold, which consists of three adjacent loops, rich in β-pleated sheet, which are connected to a globular fold where the four invariant disulfide bonds are located. However, a closer inspection of both amino acid sequences (see Table I) and spatial structures (2Endo T. Tamiya N. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 259-302Google Scholar) reveals that toxins from both categories display quite precise structural differences. Thus, virtually all long chain toxins have a longer COOH-terminal tail, an additional small loop cyclized by the fifth disulfide at the tip of the central loop, and a slightly shorter first loop. Notwithstanding these clear structural differences, toxins from both categories bind to similar sites and with comparable high affinities on peripheral nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, such as AChR from Torpedo marmorata (13Albuquerque E.X. Eldefrawi A.T. Eldefrawi M.E Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1979; 52: 377-402Crossref Google Scholar). It has been claimed that long chain toxins may bind more irreversibly than short chain toxins to AChR (14Lee C.Y. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. 1972; 12: 84-105Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 15Ishikawa Y. Ménez A. Hori H. Yoshida H. Tamiya N. Toxicon. 1977; 15: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, one may wonder why a large number of Elapidae and Hydrophiidae produce simultaneously two categories of toxins (2Endo T. Tamiya N. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 259-302Google Scholar) which apparently exert the same function.Table IAmino acid sequences of short chain and long chain snake toxins(1), erabutoxin a from L. semifasciata (62 amino acids); (2Endo T.

In the present study, binding experiments have revealed that long chain and short chain toxins present marked biological differences. Thus, long chain toxins recognize a chimeric construction of the neuronal α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor with an affinity that is nearly 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of short chain toxins. Electrophysiological experiments performed with wild-type (WT) and chimeric (α7-V201-5HT3) α7 receptors support these observations. Finally, we demonstrate that this discriminating property is associated with a specific structural feature of long chain toxins,i.e. the presence of an additional cyclized loop at the tip of their central loop. Our findings suggest that toxins should be regarded with more scrutiny concerning the expression of their possible biological activities. The cDNA of the chimeric α7-V201-5HT3 receptor was kindly provided by Prof. J. P. Changeux (Institut Pasteur, Paris). α-Bgtx, α-conotoxins MI and SI, Naja naja oxiana I,d-tubocurarine, and (−)-nicotine were purchased from Sigma. Laticauda semifasciata III and methyllycaconitine were obtained from Latoxan (Rosans, France). κ-Bgtx was obtained from Biotoxins Incorporated (St. Cloud, FL). Cobratoxin (Cbtx) fromNaja siamensis, α-toxin from N. nigricollis,Laticauda colubrina toxin, and erabutoxins a and b (Ea and Eb) from L. semifasciata were purified from their respective venoms in our laboratory according to a procedure not yet published. α-Conotoxin GI was synthetized as described previously (16Lamthanh H. Virelizier H. Frayssinhes D. Peptide Res. 1995; 8: 316-320PubMed Google Scholar).125I-Bgtx (210–250 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham. 2,2′-Dithiopyridine was purchased from Aldrich. Chimeric cDNA (α7-5HT3) was transfected into HEK 293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) by calcium precipitation with a careful control of the pH (6.95), CO2 level (3%), and cDNA amount (15 μg) as described previously (17Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) + 5 mm EDTA, rinsed twice in PBS, and finally resuspended in this buffer (3 ml/plate). This high efficiency transfection protocol allowed direct binding experiments on intact cells for 2 days. The chimeric receptor (α7-V201-5HT3) was constructed in a pMT3 vector (18Eiselé J.L.

Site-directed mutagenesis of erabutoxin a was performed using the mutagene M13in vitro mutagenesis kit from Bio-Rad as described previously (20Trémeau O. Lemaire C. Drevet P. Pinkasfeld S. Ducancel F. Boulain J.-C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9362-9369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Each mutant was submitted to amino acid analysis and sequencing. 1.2 mm Cbtx was incubated with 2.5 mmdithiothreitol in 0.2 m Tris buffer, pH 8.5, 1 mg/ml EDTA for 90 min at 4 °C. After this selective reduction, 15 mm 2,2′-dithiopyridine was added in methanol for 1 h at room temperature. After purification by gel filtration (Bio-Gel P-2) and high pressure liquid chromatography (Vydac C8) the Cbtx-dithiopyridine obtained was analyzed by mass spectrometry. The affinity of 125I-Bgtx was tested by incubating the labeled toxin (final concentration, 5 nm) with 350 μl of cells in suspension in PBS. The nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 mm(−)-nicotine. After a 40-min incubation, the sample was diluted in 3 ml of cold PBS, filtered through a GF/C filter (Whatman) previously dipped in non-fat dry milk (1%), and rinsed with 3 ml of cold PBS. The radioactivity of the filter was determined on a γ-counter. For competition experiments, we examined the effect of ligands on the initial rate of 125I-Bgtx binding. The competitors were preincubated, at different concentrations, for at least 30 min with the cell suspension and filtrated 6 min after the addition of 5 nm125I-Bgtx. The protection constant calculated by fitting the competition data by the Hill equation was shown to correspond to the K d value (6Weber M. Changeux J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar). For the κ-Bgtx, the concentration and affinity constant were determined by assuming that the toxin interacts as a dimer (21Fiordalisi J.J. Grant G.A. Crabb J. Techniques in Protein Chemistry V. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 269-274Google Scholar). Competition experiments made with AChR from T. marmorata were performed at equilibrium, using 3H-labeled toxin as a radioactive tracer. Varying amounts of toxins were incubated with 2 nmAChR and 27 Ci/mmol, 5 nm3H-α-toxin for 18 h at 20 °C, and the mixture was filtered through Millipore filters (HAWP) which had been soaked in Ringer buffer. The filters were washed with 10 ml of Ringer buffer, dried, and after the addition of 10 ml of scintillation solution (Lipoluma) counted on a Rackbeta counter (LKB). Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined from competition experiments according to Ishikawa et al.(15Ishikawa Y. Ménez A. Hori H. Yoshida H. Tamiya N. Toxicon. 1977; 15: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Oocytes were isolated and prepared as described previously (22Bertrand D. Cooper E. Valera S. Rungger D. Ballivet M. Methods Neurosci. 1991; 4: 174-193Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, ovaries were harvested fromXenopus laevis females anesthetized with 0.2% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (Tricaı̈ne from Sigma) and sacrificed by section of the spinal cord. Ovaries were then rinsed with physiological solution and a portion cut into small pieces with a razor blade. Remaining portions of the ovary can be kept for several days in the refrigerator in a clean physiological solution for later use. Oocytes were isolated by gentle mechanical and enzymatic treatment using 0.2% collagenase (Sigma type I). Healthy oocytes were then selected manually under the microscope and injected intranuclearly the next day with 10 nl of solution (injecting buffer, 88 mmNaCl, 1 mm KCl, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7) containing 2 ng of the desired cDNA. Electrophysiological recordings were performed 1–4 days later. Cells were impaled with two glass microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl and maintained in voltage clamp at −100 mV using a GENECLAMP amplifier (Axon Instruments). Cells were superfused throughout the experiment with OR2 (oocyte Ringer) containing 82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmKCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, at pH 7.4 (adjusted with NaOH) at a rate of about 6 ml/min. To prevent the possible contribution of endogenous muscarinic current all solutions were supplemented with 0.5 mm atropine. Acetylcholine was applied by a rapid switch of the perfusion with a system of electromagnetic valves (type III, General Valve, Fairfield, NJ) controlled by a personal computer. Data were converted on-line by an analog to digital converter (AT-MIO16, National Instruments) and stored for later analysis. Mathematical analysis and curve fitting were performed on Macintosh using a personal software. α-Bgtx sensitivity of oocytes, expressing significant currents in response to acetylcholine, was determined in 8 × 12 microplate wells (Nunc). To prevent toxin adsorption on plastic, all solutions were supplemented with 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. When incubated in the microplate, cells were tested as follows. (a) Currents evoked by a short pulse of acetylcholine were recorded, and electrodes were removed. (b) The cell was placed in a microwell, and the extracellular medium was exchanged completely for a solution containing the desired toxin concentration. (c) 30 min later oocytes were poked again, and the remaining acetylcholine-evoked current was measured. Fraction of the unblocked current was computed as the ratio of the acetylcholine current recorded after toxin incubation to the acetylcholine-evoked response measured in the control. Values determined for several cells were then averaged, plotted as a function of the logarithm of the toxin concentration, and fitted with the empirical Hill equation using a least squares minimizing method (Simplex). The extracellular domain of the α7 nicotinic AChR has been fused previously to the membrane region of the 5HT3 receptor (α7-V201-5HT3) (18Eiselé J.L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thierry A.

In agreement with previous results obtained from pharmacological or electrophysiological experiments with the entire α7 receptor (24Peng X. Katz M. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Lindstrom J. Mol.

The yield of receptor production was approximately 0.3 pmol of125I-Bgtx binding site/106 cells. Methyllycaconitine, a well known α7-specific ligand (26Ward J.M. Cockcroft V.B. Lunt G.G. Smillie F.S.

Methods Neurosci. 1993; 12: 263-275Google Scholar), completely inhibited the binding of radioactive α-Bgtx with a binding affinity characterized by a K d value of 1 nm, as deduced from the binding inhibition curve (data not shown). This value is in agreement with those reported in previous studies describing the interaction of methyllycaconitine with entire α7 receptors produced in other types of cells (26Ward J.M.

The family of curaremimetic snake toxins includes a large number of toxin members (2Endo T. Tamiya N. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 259-302Google Scholar). However, only α-Bgtx has been shown to bind with high affinity to the α7 receptor (29Couturier S. Bertrand S. Matter J.M. Hernandez M.C. Bertrand S. Millar S. Valera N. Barkas T. Ballivet M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 847-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). We now investigated the capacity of other snake toxins to inhibit the binding of125I-Bgtx to the recombinant chimeric α7 receptor. Thus, we examined the inhibitory activity of (a) various long chain curaremimetic toxins from snakes, including Cbtx, the α-cobratoxin from Naja kaouthia; L. semifasciata III, N. naja oxiana I, a new toxin fromL. colubrina, 2D. Servent, V. Winckler-Dietrich, H.-Y. Hu, P. Kessler, P. Drevet, D. Bertrand, and A. Ménez, unpublished data. and κ-Bgtx a neuronal toxin from B. multicinctus; and (b) some short chain curaremimetic toxins from snakes, including N. nigricollis toxin α and erabutoxins a and b (Ea and Eb) from L. semifasciata. The amino acid sequences of these toxins are shown in Table I. In general, short chain toxins possess 60–62 residues and four disulfide bonds, whereas long chain toxins possess 66–74 residues and five disulfide bonds (2Endo T. Tamiya N. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 259-302Google Scholar). L. colubrina toxin appears therefore as an exception since, although it possesses 69 residues, it lacks the 2 cysteines 29 and 33 that usually form a disulfide bridge in other long chain toxins. Therefore, L. colubrina toxin is an unusual long chain toxin with four disulfide bonds, like short chain toxins. Fig. 1 shows the capacity of varying concentrations of different toxins to inhibit the binding of a constant amount of 125I-Bgtx to the chimeric α7 receptor. In all cases, a complete dose-dependent inhibition was observed, with IC50 values ranging from approximately 9 × 10−10m for α-Bgtx to 2 × 10−5m for Ea and Eb. Clearly, two groups of competitors emerged. The most potent group is constituted exclusively of long chain toxins, whereas the weak competitors include all short chain toxins and L. colubrina toxin, whose chemical characteristics are hybrid between long chain and short chain toxins. To quantify these data better, we calculated the Hill coefficients and the protection constants that were then assimilated toK d values, as described previously (6Weber M. Changeux J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar). Results from these calculations are summarized in TableII. Thus, α-Bgtx, Cbtx, N. naja oxiana I, and L. semifasciata III display a high affinity for the α7 chimeric receptor with K dvalues equal to 1, 4.5, 12, and 3 nm, respectively. Similarly, the neuronal κ-Bgtx is characterized by aK d value equal to 5 nm. In sharp contrast, the other toxins are much weaker ligands for the chimeric receptor, the K d values of toxin α, Ea, Eb, andL. colubrina toxin being equal to 3, 21, 22, and 7 μm, respectively.Table IIAffinity constants of snake toxins on Torpedo and chimeric α7–5HT3 receptorsα7–5HT3Torpedo AChRα7/TorpedoK pn HK dRef.nmnmShort chain toxins Toxin α3,000 ± 8000.80.02(6Weber M.

Snake curaremimetic toxins have been initially recognized for their capacity to bind to peripheral AChR from Torpedo electric organs with high affinities, irrespective as to whether they are long chain or short chain toxins (13Albuquerque E.X. Eldefrawi A.T. Eldefrawi M.E Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1979; 52: 377-402Crossref Google Scholar). In agreement with this general view, competition experiments made between 3H-α-toxin or125I-Bgtx and various snake toxins toward AChR fromTorpedo (6, 30–33, this study) revealed that both short chain and long chain curaremimetic toxins, including L. colubrina toxin, had high affinities for Torpedoreceptor, with K d values ranging between 10−9 and 10−11m. Only the neuronal κ-Bgtx had a lower affinity for this receptor. To appreciate better the differential affinities of the toxins for the α7 receptor over Torpedo receptor, we calculated the ratios of their respective affinities. As shown in Table II, the ratios vary between 2 and 35 for long chain curaremimetic toxins, except L. colubrina toxin, whereas they are close to 3 × 105 for both short toxins and L. colubrinatoxin. Therefore, long chain curaremimetic toxins exert similar binding affinities for both α7 and Torpedo AChRs, whereas short chain toxins and L. colubrina toxin have a marked preference for Torpedo AChR. Not unexpectedly, the ratio of affinities of κ-Bgtx is unique, with an affinity approximately 100-fold higher for the α7 chimeric receptor compared with Torpedo, further indicating the particular character of the α7 receptor, which is capable of binding both long chain curaremimetic and neuronal toxins with high affinities. Recently, it was observed that α-Bgtx and two new short chain toxins from the Australian snake Oxyuranus scutellatus bind to homogenates from chick optic lobes, a tissue that is likely to contain various neuronal receptors, including the α7 receptor.

Previously, we found that the β1 subunit of the AMPK was multiply phosphorylated in an intramolecular autophosphorylation reaction (14Michell B.J. Stapleton D. Mitchelhill K.I. House C.M. Katsis F.

The β1subunit of the AMPK contains an N-terminal consensus sequence for myristoylation with glycine at position 1 and serine (a small uncharged residue) at position 5 (15Aitken A. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Lipid Modification of Proteins. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 63-88Google Scholar).In view of the potential importance of posttranslational modifications of the AMPK subunits in its physiological function, we have characterized the native state of the β subunit. We find that the β subunit purified from rat liver is fully myristoylated and present as a mixture of di- and triphosphorylated species with small amounts of monophospho-β subunit. Autophosphorylation of the AMPK in vitro results in up to 6 or more moles of phosphate incorporated per mole of β subunit. The mass of the isolated N-terminally acetylated γ subunit is identical to the mass inferred from the cDNA sequence and is not phosphorylated.DISCUSSIONThe N terminus of β1 (MGNTSSERAA … ) contains a penultimate glycine (Gly2) in an appropriate context of downstream sequence (MGNXXS) of other known myristoylation sites (15Aitken A. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Lipid Modification of Proteins. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 63-88Google Scholar). In some cases myristoylation is responsible for targeting proteins to the membrane, but may also facilitate protein/protein interactions (22Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Adams S.P. Glaser L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 69-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Science. 1993; 259: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) has been shown to facilitate membrane binding, but for calcineurin-B and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, myristoylation does not affect membrane association (27Zhu D. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24831-24838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Recurring basic amino acids and palmitoylation may also effect membrane binding either alone (27Zhu D. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24831-24838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or with myristoyl groups (28Sigal C.T. Zhou W. Buser C.A. McLaughlin S. Resh M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12253-12257Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A number of evenly spaced basic amino acids that could potentially interact with acidic phospholipids in membrane bilayers have been described for thesrc proteins (23Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) and there is a polybasic sequence in the N terminus of β1 (Arg8, Arg13, Lys18, Arg20, Arg21). The β1 subunit is not modified by palmitoylation. In other examples the myristoyl-dependent membrane association may also be modulated by protein phosphorylation (24Taniguchi H. Manenti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9960-9963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or calcium binding (26Dizhoor A.M. Chen C.K. Olshevskaya E. Sinelnikova V.V. Phillipov P. Hurley J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and play a role in signal-induced protein localization. The present studies indicate that the presence/absence of the penultimate Gly2 myristoylation site has a modest influence on the intracellular localization of AMPK heterotrimer, although other factors also seem to be involved. More studies are needed to examine the role/localization of particulate AMPK in the action of this kinase. It is not known if the presence of the myristate group contributes to the stability of the AMPK heterotrimer as it does for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (29Yonemoto W. McGlone M.L. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2348-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Extensive in vitro phosphorylation of noncatalytic subunits of protein kinases has been observed for a number of protein kinases including phosphorylase kinase and CK2 (30Wang J.H. Stull J.T. Huang T.S. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4521-4527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Desjardins P.R. Lue P.F. Liew C.C. Gornall A.G. Can. J. Biochem. 1972; 50: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) but the physiological significance of these phosphorylation events is uncertain. In the AMPK we have found three phosphorylation sites in the native β1 subunit, whereas no phosphorylation of the γ subunit has been observed. Of the three β1 phosphorylation sites, Ser24/25 and Ser108 are part of the intramolecular autophosphorylation cascade that are phosphorylatedin vivo. There are (at least) three additional sites present in the hyperphosphorylated state following in vitroautophosphorylation that we have not characterized. We have observed these on two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps (32van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) of tryptic peptides derived from in gel digests of autophosphorylated β1subunit. Phosphorylation at Ser182 seems likely to result from phosphorylation by a separate protein kinase with a Ser-Pro specificity. This site appears to be stoichiometrically phosphorylated in the native enzyme as no additional [32P]phosphate is incorporated into this site; the corresponding dephosphorylated peptide is not detected nor is any dephosphorylated β1 subunit detected.We were unable to obtain electrospray mass spectrometry data on the native α subunit to determine its state of phosphorylation. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of in vitro and cell-labeled α1 subunits indicate that they are multiply phosphorylated (data not shown). The phosphorylation site Thr172 in the activation loop that is phosphorylated by the AMPK kinase has been recently characterized (21Hawley S.A. Davison M. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K. Carling D.

Our intact cell studies with expression of AMPK heterotrimers indicate that α1 Thr172 is critical for enzyme activity and that its absence diminishes phosphorylation of both the α1 and β1 subunits. Furthermore, upon activation of AMPK activity by the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation with sodium azide, no increase in 32P content in either α1 or β1 is observed when the T172A mutant is incorporated into the heterotrimer. These data indicate that Thr172 is the critical activating phosphorylation site under these conditions and that β1subunit phosphorylation, in part, occurs through an intramolecular autophosphorylation. However, there is residual phosphorylation of both α1 and β1 subunits, even in the absence of an active catalytic subunit (we have been unable to detect any endogenous α1 subunit in COS-7 cells), suggesting that there may be distinct AMPK kinases active on both the α1and β1 subunits.

Previously, we found that the β1 subunit of the AMPK was multiply phosphorylated in an intramolecular autophosphorylation reaction (14Michell B.J. Stapleton D. Mitchelhill K.I. House C.M. Katsis F.

The β1subunit of the AMPK contains an N-terminal consensus sequence for myristoylation with glycine at position 1 and serine (a small uncharged residue) at position 5 (15Aitken A. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Lipid Modification of Proteins. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 63-88Google Scholar). In view of the potential importance of posttranslational modifications of the AMPK subunits in its physiological function, we have characterized the native state of the β subunit. We find that the β subunit purified from rat liver is fully myristoylated and present as a mixture of di- and triphosphorylated species with small amounts of monophospho-β subunit. Autophosphorylation of the AMPK in vitro results in up to 6 or more moles of phosphate incorporated per mole of β subunit. The mass of the isolated N-terminally acetylated γ subunit is identical to the mass inferred from the cDNA sequence and is not phosphorylated. DISCUSSIONThe N terminus of β1 (MGNTSSERAA … ) contains a penultimate glycine (Gly2) in an appropriate context of downstream sequence (MGNXXS) of other known myristoylation sites (15Aitken A. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Lipid Modification of Proteins. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 63-88Google Scholar). In some cases myristoylation is responsible for targeting proteins to the membrane, but may also facilitate protein/protein interactions (22Towler D.A. Gordon J.I. Adams S.P. Glaser L. Annu. Rev.

The β1 subunit is not modified by palmitoylation. In other examples the myristoyl-dependent membrane association may also be modulated by protein phosphorylation (24Taniguchi H. Manenti S. J. Biol.

The present studies indicate that the presence/absence of the penultimate Gly2 myristoylation site has a modest influence on the intracellular localization of AMPK heterotrimer, although other factors also seem to be involved. More studies are needed to examine the role/localization of particulate AMPK in the action of this kinase. It is not known if the presence of the myristate group contributes to the stability of the AMPK heterotrimer as it does for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (29Yonemoto W. McGlone M.L. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2348-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Extensive in vitro phosphorylation of noncatalytic subunits of protein kinases has been observed for a number of protein kinases including phosphorylase kinase and CK2 (30Wang J.H.

Biochem. 1972; 50: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) but the physiological significance of these phosphorylation events is uncertain. In the AMPK we have found three phosphorylation sites in the native β1 subunit, whereas no phosphorylation of the γ subunit has been observed. Of the three β1 phosphorylation sites, Ser24/25 and Ser108 are part of the intramolecular autophosphorylation cascade that are phosphorylatedin vivo. There are (at least) three additional sites present in the hyperphosphorylated state following in vitroautophosphorylation that we have not characterized. We have observed these on two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps (32van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) of tryptic peptides derived from in gel digests of autophosphorylated β1subunit. Phosphorylation at Ser182 seems likely to result from phosphorylation by a separate protein kinase with a Ser-Pro specificity. This site appears to be stoichiometrically phosphorylated in the native enzyme as no additional [32P]phosphate is incorporated into this site; the corresponding dephosphorylated peptide is not detected nor is any dephosphorylated β1 subunit detected.We were unable to obtain electrospray mass spectrometry data on the native α subunit to determine its state of phosphorylation. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of in vitro and cell-labeled α1 subunits indicate that they are multiply phosphorylated (data not shown). The phosphorylation site Thr172 in the activation loop that is phosphorylated by the AMPK kinase has been recently characterized (21Hawley S.A. Davison M. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K. Carling D.

https://openalex.org/W2072289725,"The anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase ofEscherichia coli catalyzes the synthesis of the deoxyribonucleotides required for anaerobic DNA synthesis. The enzyme is an α2β2 heterotetramer. In its active form, the large α2 subunit contains an oxygen-sensitive glycyl radical, whereas the β2 small protein harbors a [4Fe-4S] cluster that joins its two polypeptide chains. Formation of the glycyl radical in the inactive enzyme requiresS-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), dithiothreitol, K+, and either an enzymatic (reduced flavodoxin) or chemical (dithionite or 5-deazaflavin plus light) reducing system. Here, we demonstrate that AdoMet is directly reduced by the Fe-S center of β2 during the activation of the enzyme, resulting in methionine and glycyl radical formation. Direct binding experiments showed that AdoMet binds to β2 with aK d of 10 μm and a 1:1 stoichiometry. Binding was confirmed by EPR spectroscopy that demonstrated the formation of a complex between AdoMet and the [4Fe-4S] center of β2. Dithiothreitol triggered the cleavage of AdoMet, leading to an EPR-silent form of β2 and, in the case of α2β2, to glycyl radical formation. In both instances, 3 methionines were formed per mol of protein. Our results indicate that the Fe-S center of β2 is directly involved in the reductive cleavage of AdoMet and suggest a new biological function for an iron-sulfur center, i.e redox catalysis, as recently proposed by others (Staples, R.

Escherichia coli uses different enzymes for thede novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) during aerobic and anaerobic growth (1Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The aerobic ribonucleotide reductase, coded by nrdAB genes, has an α2β2 structure, with the large α2 protein carrying allosteric and catalytic sites and the small β2 protein harboring two oxo-bridged diferric centers capable of forming and stabilizing a tyrosyl radical in their vicinity (2Fontecave M. Nordlund P. Eklund H. Reichard P. Adv. Enzymol. 1992; 65: 147-183PubMed Google Scholar). During catalysis, the stable tyrosyl radical is thought to generate by long range electron transfer a transient thiyl radical on the large protein which, together with two redox-active thiols, catalyzes the reduction of the ribose group to deoxyribose (3Mao S.

Both generate a stable free amino acid radical, as part of their protein structure, essential for activity: a tyrosyl radical in the case of the aerobic enzyme and a glycyl radical in the anaerobic one. The activation of the aerobic reductase is reasonably well understood; generation of the tyrosyl radical is an oxygen-dependent process in which the iron center is involved (14Atkin C.L. Thelander L.

As prepared, the pure enzyme lacks the glycyl radical and is inactive. The radical is generated, and the enzyme is activated during anaerobic incubation withS-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; DTT, dithiothreitol; 5-DAF, 5-deaza-7,8-demethyl-10-methylisoalloxazine; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. together with NADPH, flavodoxin, flavodoxin reductase, K+, and dithiothreitol (DTT) (8Sun X.

Mulliez E. Hoover D.M. Matthews R.G. Reichard P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 197: 792-797Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). During the reaction, AdoMet is reduced and cleaved to 5′-deoxyadenosine and methionine (17Harder J. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Ballinger M.D. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25548-25552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar mechanism seems to operate during generation of catalytic free radicals in pyruvate-formate-lyase from E. coli and lysine 2,3-aminomutase from Clostridium pasteurianum (21Frey M. Rothe M. Wagner A.F.V. Knappe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12432-12437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Moss M.L. Frey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18112-18115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both contain a metal center and require AdoMet, which is converted to 5′-deoxyadenosine and methionine during the reaction. Against this background, we suggested in 1993 a speculative scheme for the generation of the glycyl radical of the anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase, involving four steps (9Mulliez E. Fontecave M. Gaillard J. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2296-2299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the first, the iron-sulfur cluster of the enzyme is reduced by the flavodoxin system or by photoreduced deazaflavin. In the second step, AdoMet is bound and reduced to a radical intermediate, which in the third step is cleaved to the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical and methionine. Finally, in the fourth step, this radical generates the glycyl radical by abstracting a hydrogen atom of the α-carbon of glycine 681 (10Sun X. Ollagnier S. Schmidt P.P. Atta M. Mulliez E. Lepape L.

In the present work, we present a series of experiments involving the separate β2 protein and the complete α2β2 enzyme that provide evidence for the proposed scheme described above. It is thus shown that AdoMet is reduced by the reduced iron-sulfur center, resulting in methionine and glycyl radical formation. This suggests a new biological function for an iron-sulfur cluster. All components of the anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase system were prepared as described previously (6Sun X. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Andersson J. Buist G. Sjöberg B.-M. Reichard P. J. Biol.

Pyruvate ferredoxin:oxidoreductase from C. pasteurianum was provided by J.-M Moulis (CENG, Grenoble, France) and ferredoxin IV from Rhodobacter capsulatus was provided by Y. Jouanneau (CENG, Grenoble, France). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). AdoMet was from Boehringer Mannheim, and sodium dithionite was from Fluka. 5-Deaza-7,8-demethyl-10-methylisoalloxazine (5-DAF) was available in our laboratory. [methyl-3H]AdoMet (60–90 Ci·mmol−1) was from Amersham Corp. It was isotopically diluted 200-fold and purified over a Whatmann CM cellulose cation exchange column (2 ml). Pure AdoMet was eluted with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8. After lyophilization, the solid residue was diluted in 50 mm Mes, pH 6 to make a 500 μm stock solution (400–800 cpm·pmol−1). Because of spontaneous degradation, storage at −20 °C should not exceed a period of 1 month. In the first step, the enzyme (0.32 μm), in a total volume of 20 μl, was deaerated with moist argon on a manifold during 30 min at room temperature. In parallel, the activation mixture was deaerated separately in the dark, and 15 μl were added to the protein solution so that the final concentrations were 5 mm sodium formate, 5 mm DTT, 30 mm potassium chloride, 500 μm AdoMet, 38 μm 5-DAF, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Irradiation with a slide projector, 20 cm away from the reaction mixture, was then applied for 30 min under argon. When sodium dithionite was substituted for 5-DAF, it was added separately from a deaerated stock solution in 30 mmTris-HCl, pH 8. In this case, the protein solution received first dithionite (final concentration 4 μm), followed by the activation mixture. The solution was then incubated for 30 min. A third activating mixture was also used. It is similar to the one described first except that flavodoxin, flavodoxin reductase and NADPH (final concentrations of 20 μg/ml, 40 μg/ml, and 1.25 mm, respectively) replaced 5-DAF. In the second step, 15 μl of the substrate mixture (giving a final concentration of 1.4 mm [3H]CTP (10 cpm/pmol), 1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2) was added to initiate the reduction of the substrate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of 1 m HClO4, and the solution was worked up as described earlier (24Eliasson R. Pontis E. Fontecave M. Gerez C. Harder J. Jörnvall H. Krook M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25541-25547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity represents the formation of 1 nmol of dCTP/min. β2 (40 pmol) or α2β2 (16–40 pmol) and [methyl-3H]AdoMet (15 μm) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature under a stream of humidified argon in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 40 mmKCl, 8 mm DTT and either 2 mm NADPH, flavodoxin (0.4 μg), and flavodoxin reductase (0.1 μg) or 5 μm5-DAF in a total volume of 35 μl. With 5-DAF, irradiation with a slide projector was required. The reaction was stopped by adding 665 μl of cold water, and then 600 μl were loaded onto a 2-ml Bio-Rad Dowex 50WX8 (Na+ form) column. Methionine was measured from the radioactivity eluted with 3 ml of water. Control experiments indicated that, under these conditions, more than 98.5% of AdoMet was bound and more than 95% of methionine ([35S]methionine) was recovered. Appropriate controls without proteins gave the corresponding blank values. Low temperature EPR spectra were recorded on a Varian E 109 (9.5 GHz) EPR spectrometer or on a Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer, both equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR 900 Helium Flow Cryostat. Double integrals of EPR signals were evaluated by using a computer online with the spectrometer. All of the 0.2-ml samples were introduced into quartz EPR tubes under argon and sealed with a rubber septum. 1 mg of α2β2 was incubated anaerobically in an EPR tube with 0.5 mm AdoMet, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm sodium formate, 30 mm KCl, 20 μg of flavodoxin, 80 μg of flavodoxin reductase, 1.25 mm NADPH in 0.2 ml of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After 10 min reaction under anaerobic conditions, the EPR tube was frozen in liquid nitrogen and analyzed by EPR spectroscopy for its glycyl radical content. Proteins β2 or α2β2 (20–140 μm) in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, were deaerated in EPR tubes inside an anaerobic box at 4 °C for 1 h. Then the EPR tubes were transferred to an anaerobic manifold. Some of them received 5–10 mm dithionite exclusively, while others received first a deaerated solution of AdoMet (from 0 to 5 mm) immediately followed by dithionite. After a 40-min incubation at room temperature, the tubes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and analyzed by EPR spectroscopy. For the power saturation experiment (Fig. 1 D) the amplitude of the central component of the EPR signal (g = 1.92) was measured as a function of the incident microwave power in the 40–4 db (0.02–82 milliwatts) range at 10 K. The amplitude at the lowest power value was taken as 100%. At each power increment, the amplifier gain was changed to keep the signal amplitude constant under nonsaturating conditions. Methionine content was determined with a Pharmacia-LKB4151 Alpha Plus amino acid analyzer. All of the following procedures were done under strict anaerobic conditions. β2 or α2β2 in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 30 mm KCl was deaerated inside an anaerobic box during 1 h at 4 °C in an EPR tube. Reduction was started on the manifold by irradiation of the protein solution in the presence of 5-DAF (38 μm) at room temperature. After 40 min, the solution was put in the dark using an aluminum foil, and AdoMet (0.5 mm) was added anaerobically. At time intervals (from 0 to 120 min), an aliquot (1 nmol of protein) was removed and assayed for methionine formation. The rest of the solution was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for EPR spectroscopy analyses of the iron-sulfur center for β2 or of the glycyl radical for α2β2. Recording conditions were as follows for the iron-sulfur center: microwave power, 0.1 milliwatt; modulation amplitude, 1 millitesla; frequency, 9.62 GHz; temperature, 10 K. For the glycyl radical, conditions were as follows: microwave power, 1 microwatt; frequency, 9.62 GHz; modulation amplitude, 1 millitesla; temperature, 20 K. A filter-binding assay used earlier to measure binding of allosteric effectors to ribonucleotide reductase (25Söderman K. Reichard P. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was adapted to the anaerobic conditions required for the present experiments. In the standard procedure, the enzyme in a volume of 90 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 20 mm KCl was flushed at room temperature with moistened argon for 60 min on an anaerobic manifold, followed by the addition of 10 μl of an anaerobic solution of 25 mm dithionite to reduce the iron-sulfur center. Also, reduction by 5-DAF plus light was used, but with less reproducible results. After an additional 20 min, the closed tube was shifted to an anaerobic hood kept at +4 °C, received 0.9 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm dithionite, and was transferred to the chamber of a syringe attached to a filter device containing a GSWP 01300 Millipore filter (25Söderman K. Reichard P. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). [methyl-3H]AdoMet in 20 μl was added, and the mixture was immediately pushed through the filter. The filter was removed, blotted from underneath with Kleenex, and transferred to a scintillation vial. After the addition of 1 ml of 0.1 mHCl, the radioactivity was determined and, after substraction of an appropriate blank lacking the enzyme, used to calculate the amount of AdoMet on the filter. In some experiments, the volume during the filtration step was decreased to 0.15 ml, and the filtrate was used to analyze for the formation of methionine during the binding process. The smaller volume provided a higher sensitivity for the assays. In these experiments, we could also determine the amount of AdoMet bound to the filter from the loss of radioactivity in the filtrate. All binding experiments were done as duplicates. With some practice, variation between duplicates was usually below 10%. The limitations of the method arise from a combination of two problems: the limited capacity of the filter to bind protein and the increasing background radioactivity at increasing concentrations of the labeled ligand. In the following, α2β2defines solutions obtained by incubation of stoichiometric 1:1 amounts of each pure protein: the iron-free α2 large protein and the β2 small protein (containing two irons and two sulfides per polypeptide chain) prepared separately from overproducingE. coli strains (7Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9410-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fig. 1shows the light absorption spectrum of the oxidized enzyme (Fig.1 A) and the EPR spectrum after anaerobic reduction with either dithionite or photoreduced 5-DAF (Fig. 1 B). Both spectra of α2β2 were almost identical to those of β2, reported previously (7Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9410-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The power saturation properties (Fig. 1 C) and the temperature dependence (not shown) of this EPR signal are characteristic of a [4Fe-4S]+ center and close to those of β2. Quantification of the EPR signal showed that the reduction was quantitative with 5-DAF as the reducing agent. With dithionite, the reduction yield did not exceed 50–70%. This then indicates that the properties of α2β2 are exclusively due to the [4Fe-4S] center of β2 and that binding of α2 to β2 has only minor effects on the symmetry and the electronic properties of that center. During affinity chromatography of α2β2 on dATP-Sepharose, the iron-sulfur center was partially converted into an oxidized [3Fe-4S]+ center, as shown from the appearance of an intense characteristic isotropic EPR signal at g= 2.01 (Fig. 1 D). This explains why we earlier concluded that the reductase, when purified by dATP-Sepharose chromatography, contains a [3Fe-4S]+ cluster (9Mulliez E. Fontecave M. Gaillard J. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2296-2299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of α2β2involves the generation of a glycyl radical on α2 during anaerobic incubation with AdoMet, K+, DTT, and a reducing system. Photoreduced 5-DAF (19Bianchi V. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Mulliez E. Hoover D.M. Matthews R.G. Reichard P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 197: 792-797Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) could generate active enzymes with specific activities of up to 1000 nmol of dCTP/min/mg of protein. As shown in Fig. 2 (A andB), dithionite was also able to activate α2β2. The maximal specific activity, obtained with a 12-fold molar excess of dithionite after a 30-min incubation, was 400. As shown above, both dithionite and 5-DAF converted the iron-sulfur center of α2β2 to the EPR-active reduced [4Fe-4S]+ form. NADPH plus flavodoxin plus flavodoxin reductase also generates an active α2β2 protein, with a specific activity of about 400 (19Bianchi V. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Mulliez E. Hoover D.M. Matthews R.G. Reichard P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 197: 792-797Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the EPR signal of the glycyl radical (Fig. 3) showed formation of up to one radical per α2β2 after a 10-min reaction. However, this reducing system did not give rise to any discernible iron-based EPR signal during incubation with α2β2 in the absence of AdoMet. This showed that the enzyme was not reduced to the [4Fe-4S]+ form by flavodoxin. During activation of the enzyme, AdoMet is converted to 5′-deoxyadenosine and methionine (17Harder J. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Ballinger M.D. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25548-25552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This reaction can be monitored by using [methyl-3H]AdoMet and measuring the formation of [methyl-3H] methionine. Fig. 4 shows that α2β2 catalyzes the reduction of AdoMet to methionine either by NADPH in the presence of flavodoxin and flavodoxin reductase or by photoreduced 5-DAF. DTT greatly stimulated the reaction (data not shown). No methionine could be detected when β2or the reducing agent was omitted from the activation mixture. As shown in Fig. 4, β2 alone could support the reaction with 5-DAF as the reducing agent, with DTT again required for maximal activity. However, no methionine formation was observed with the flavodoxin system as a reducing reagent (data not shown). Thus, α2had a clear stimulating effect. Since apo-β2, the iron-depleted form, was totally inactive (data not shown) with either reducing system even in the presence of α2, the iron-sulfur center appeared to be the key component of the enzyme. Binding experiments with [methyl-3H]AdoMet were done under anaerobic conditions by a filter binding assay (25Söderman K. Reichard P. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein was first reduced on the anaerobic manifold with either dithionite or 5-DAF, transferred to the filtration device in the anaerobic hood, mixed with AdoMet, and filtered. Bound AdoMet was retained on the filter together with protein, and its amount was determined either from the radioactivity on the filter or from the decrease of radioactivity in the filtrate. Binding strictly depended on the presence of K+, whereas Mg2+ was not required (TableI). The addition of DTT improved the binding capacity of β2 significantly. When air was admitted to the reduced enzyme, no AdoMet was bound. Methionine was not produced during the short time period it took to mix and filter the solution. However, when enzyme plus AdoMet were incubated at +4 °C, a slow formation of methionine, found exclusively in the filtrate, ensued without loss of bound AdoMet (Fig.5). No methionine was bound to the enzyme at any time point (data not shown). These results show that enzyme-bound AdoMet, at +4 °C, was slowly reduced to methionine that was immediately released from the protein. In the presence of an excess of dithionite, the iron-sulfur center remained reduced and could continuously bind new molecules of AdoMet.Table IRequirements for binding of AdoMet to β2Reaction conditionsν̄Complete system0.62−DTT0.14−KCl0.01+MgCl20.57+Air0.00The complete system was as described under “Experimental Procedures” with 51 μg of β2 and 40 μm[methyl-3H]AdoMet in a filtration volume of 1.0 ml.

Open table in a new tab The complete system was as described under “Experimental Procedures” with 51 μg of β2 and 40 μm[methyl-3H]AdoMet in a filtration volume of 1.0 ml. When added, Mg2+ was 10 mm. Where indicated, air was admitted after reduction of the iron-sulfur cluster, and filtration was made aerobically (ν̄ = mol of bound AdoMet/mol of β2). Fig. 6 A shows a Scatchard plot in which the binding stoichiometry (ν̄ = mol of bound AdoMet/mol of β2) was calculated at varying AdoMet concentrations. The slope of the linear curve gives a binding constant of 10 μm. The curve extrapolates at the abscissa to a value of 0.6 mole/mole of β2. Fig. 6 Bshows results from a separate experiment in which AdoMet binding was determined at increasing protein concentrations. A linear relation is found up to 40 μg (1.1 μm) of β2, but then the curve levels off rapidly. In the experiment depicted in Fig. 6, we used 51 μg (1.5 μm), slightly outside the proportional range, to give better signal:noise ratios. Correcting for this fact, we calculate that 1 mol of our preparation of β2 could bind 0.7–0.75 mol of AdoMet and suggest a 1:1 stoichiometry for the binding of AdoMet to β2. The binding behavior of β2 did not change noticeably when α2 was added in the experiment (data not shown). However, minor changes would not have been detected, since this experiment was made with only 10 μg of β2 (together with 40 μg of α2) in view of the limited protein binding capacity of the membrane. Characterization of a reduced β2-AdoMet complex by EPR spectroscopy can only be achieved if electron transfer to and subsequent cleavage of AdoMet is significantly slowed down. From the observation that DTT greatly stimulated the formation of methionine during the β2-catalyzed reduction of AdoMet, a simple way to produce this condition was to omit DTT from the reaction mixture. Anaerobic incubation of β2 in the absence of DTT with a chemical reductant (dithionite or photoreduced 5-DAF) for 1 h generated the previously reported EPR spectrum, indicating that the iron-sulfur center had been reduced to a [4Fe-4S]+ form. When AdoMet was added to the reaction mixture, the EPR spectrum was instantaneously modified with the low f"

We found the presence of three major lipid components of E. coli whole lipid to be essential for creation of the large lesions observed in LUV: phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin. Cardiolipin appears to play a key role because no leakage can be induced when only phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine are present.

Invest. 1985; 76: 1436-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 2Wilde C.G. Griffith J.E. Marra M.N. Snable J.L. Scott R.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1985; 260: 4579-4584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They are small (M r = ∼4000) cationic antimicrobial peptides that act primarily by permeabilizing the cell membranes of a wide variety of microbes (4Lichtenstein A. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R.I. Blood. 1986; 68: 1407-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lehrer R.I. Szklarek D. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1985; 49: 207-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Daher K.A. Harwig S.S.L. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Neutrophil defensins have 29–34 amino acids, are rich in arginine (4–10 per molecule), and have three disulfide bonds that stabilize a rigid β-sheet structure (see Ref. 7White S.H. Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholarfor a review). The amino acid sequences of the six rabbit and four human neutrophil defensins are presented in Fig.1 (residues are numbered according to the NP-1 sequence). Although neutrophil defensins kill bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses effectively, they are tolerated at high concentrations inside membrane-bound neutrophil granules. The suggestion has thus been made that antimicrobial peptide selectivity is determined by differences in the lipid compositions of the target and host membranes (8Tytler E.M. Anantharamaiah G.M. Walker D.E. Mishra V.K. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Available evidence supports the hypothesis that the principal mode of action of neutrophil defensins involves physical perturbation and permeabilization of the membranes of the target organisms (6Lehrer R.I.

Therefore, studies of defensin-induced permeabilization of model membranes provide valuable insight to their permeabilization of biological membranes (11Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1362-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 12Hristova K. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11888-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). An important observation is that neutrophil defensins isolated from different species vary in their mode of action. Human neutrophil defensin HNP-2 forms large multimeric pores in large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) 1The abbreviations used are: LUV, extruded unilamellar vesicles of 100-nm diameter; POPE, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine; POPG, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol; POPC, 1palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; diPG, di-phosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin);E. coli whole lipid, chloroform-methanol extract of lyophilized E. coli cells; ANTS, 8-aminonapthalene-1,3,6 trisulfonic acid, M r = 427.33; DPX,p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide, M r = 422.16; HNP, human neutrophil peptide (human defensin) NP, rabbit neutrophil peptide (rabbit defensin); FD-4, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran, M r 4,400; FD-20, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran, M r18,900; FD-70, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran,M r 50,700; NBD-PE, 7-nitro-benzoxadiazole phosphatidylethanolamine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.formed from POPG, causing the vesicle contents to be released in an all-or-none manner (11Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1362-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Rabbit neutrophil defensins cause graded leakage (12Hristova K. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11888-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Despite high sequence identity and three-dimensional structural similarity of monomers, HNP-2 exists as dimers in aqueous solution, whereas rabbit defensins are always monomeric. This suggests that the lack of aqueous dimerization by rabbit neutrophil defensins leads to a fundamental difference in defensin assembly on the membrane surface and thus in the mechanism of permeabilization (11Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1362-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 12Hristova K. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11888-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Another important observation is that the lipid composition of the LUV is important; small additions of neutral lipids (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) or 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE)) to POPG LUV eliminate leakage even though defensins can bind to the mixed bilayers (12Hristova K. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11888-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This indicates that lipid composition can strongly influence membrane permeabilization by neutrophil defensins. A third observation of importance is that small differences in monomer sequence can have large effects on membrane permeabilization (12Hristova K. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11888-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the present study, our goal was to examine in greater detail the lipid requirements for rabbit neutrophil defensin action using defensin concentrations that are well within the normal physiological range (13Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R.I. Eur. J. Hematol. 1990; 44: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We began with an examination of the interactions of the six known rabbit neutrophil defensins, individually and as the “natural” mixture, with LUV made from whole lipid extracts of Escherichia coli membranes. The lipid content varies among strains but typically is about 20–50% charged lipid (PG and diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin, diPG) and about 50–80% neutral lipid (PE) (14Randle C.L. Albro P.W. Dittmer J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 187: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We found that defensins NP-1, NP-2, NP-3A, NP-3B, and the natural mixture NP-1–5 induced membrane permeabilization, probably through large scale transient lesions. NP-4 and NP-5 alone had no effect on membrane permeability but did have synergistic effects when used in combination with other defensins. Under the same experimental conditions, bilayer permeabilization of POPG vesicles was fundamentally different as indicated by leakage that had a preference to DPX (12Hristova K. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11888-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and was slower. We then examined the permeabilization by NP-2 and NP-5 of LUV composed of various combinations of the three major E. coli lipid components, POPE, POPG, and cardiolipin, and confirmed the strong influence of lipid composition on the activity of rabbit neutrophil defensins. Cardiolipin was found to be especially important, although all three lipids must be present to mimic E. coliwhole lipid. Further, we identified amino acid residues in the sequence of the six rabbit defensins that may be crucial for the observed activity. Our results indicate that permeabilization of microbial membranes is likely to be extremely sensitive to lipid composition, as well as to the composition of the defensin mixture. E. coli whole lipid extracts as PE from E. coli ∼50%, lot 41H8362, and fluorescein-labeled dextrans FD-4, FD-20, and FD-70 were purchased from Sigma. The lipid composition of the extract was analyzed by Avanti Polar Lipids using normal phase HPLC with evaporative light scattering detection. Consistent with other studies (14Randle C.L. Albro P.W. Dittmer J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 187: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Kanemasa Y. Yoshioka T. Ichikawa H. Takai K. Acta Med.

Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 833-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the three major components of the extract are PE (78%), diPG (14.4%), and PG (4.7%). The preparation also contained minor components identified as phosphatidylcholine (1.2%), phosphatidylserine (0.8%), and lyso-PE (0.9%). NBD- and rhodamine-labeled lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). ANTS and DPX were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Water was glass distilled. The buffer composition was 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm NaN3, pH 7.0. About 70 mg of lipid was combined in chloroform that was subsequently removed under a stream of argon. About 1 ml of buffer containing ANTS/DPX or dextran was added to the dry lipids, and the suspension was frozen and thawed 10 times to assure maximum entrapment prior to extrusion (11Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1362-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The final lipid concentration was typically 100 mm. A stock solution of LUV of approximately 0.1 μm in diameter was formed by extrusion under N2 pressure through Nucleopore polycarbonate membranes (11Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1362-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar,18Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). The concentrations of solutes used were 9 mm ANTS, 25 mm DPX, 8 mg/ml FD-4, 20 mg/ml FD-20, and 40 mg/ml FD-70. Assuming that the concentration inside the vesicles equaled the initial concentration, we estimated entrapment of about 200–300 dextrans/vesicle; entrapment of ANTS/DPX should be about an order of magnitude higher. The total KCl concentration in ANTS/DPX-containing vesicles was adjusted so that the entrapped solutions had the same osmolarity as the external 50 mm KCl buffer. Unencapsulated ANTS and DPX were separated from encapsulated material using Sephadex G-100 packed in a 2.5-ml Pasteur pipette. Untrapped FD-4, FD-20, and FD-70 were removed on a 45 × 1.3-cm Sephadex G-100 column run at approximately 1 ml/min. Typically, about 50 μl of the vesicle stock solution (above) was applied to the column and eluted with several milliliters of buffer. The fraction of the effluent collected (about 0.8 ml) had a lipid concentration of about 14 mm. After separation, nonfluorescent dextran of approximately the same molecular weight was added externally to the FD-4, FD-20, and FD-70 liposomal suspensions of E. colilipids to eliminate any osmotic stress on the vesicles. No detectable leakage of any solutes in the absence of defensin was observed during periods of time corresponding to the duration of the experiments. Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed using either a SPEX Fluorolog fluorimeter that was upgraded and interfaced to a computer by OLIS, Inc. (Jefferson, GA) or a SLM AMINCO 8100 spectrophotometer (Rochester, NY). Excitation and emission wavelengths were as follows: ANTS (SPEX): excitation, 360 nm (slit, 20 nm), and emission, 515 nm (slit, 50 nm); NBD-PE (SPEX): excitation, 465 nm: (slit, 8 nm), and emission, 530 nm (slit, 8 nm); FD-20 (SPEX): excitation, 495 (slit, 8 nm), and emission, 525 (slit, 8 nm); and FD-4 and FD-70 (SLM AMINCO): excitation, 495 (slit, 1 nm), and emission, 525 (slit, 4 nm). Right angle geometry and no reference signal were used. Emission spectra covering the range of the fluorescence spectra of the fluorophores were collected from samples with and without vesicles to assure that light scattering made no contribution to the fluorescence signals of the fluorophores. We found in all cases that the scattering peak made no significant contribution to the fluorescence signals at the emission wavelengths used. Vesicles containing ANTS/DPX, FD-4, FD-20, and FD-70 at about 400 μm were placed into 1 × 0.2-cm quartz cuvette (volume, 0.5 ml), and the fluorescence increase due to leakage and subsequent dilution of quenched dye was measured after the addition of defensin. Data are presented in terms of fractional fluorescence f F = (F− F initial)/(F max −F initial), where F is the measured fluorescence, F initial is the initial quenched fluorescence, and F max is the fluorescence corresponding to 100% leakage as established by the addition of 0.4% Triton X-100. In the absence of leakage, a fluorescenceF initial = QF max is observed, where Q is the quenching factor (about 0.14–0.2 for E. coli whole lipid/ANTS/DPX vesicles, 0.2 for E. coli whole lipid/FD-4, 0.5 for E. coli whole lipid/FD-20, and 0.6 for E. coli whole lipid/FD-70 vesicles). Note that Q = 0 corresponds to complete quenching, whereas Q = 1 corresponds to no quenching. There are two general mechanisms of leakage. It can be a graded process in which all vesicles release portions of their contents, or it can be an all-or-none process in which some vesicles lose all of their contents while others lose none. One can distinguish between these two possibilities using the so-called fluorescence requenching method, which is based on the idea that the ANTS molecules inside and outside the vesicles show different susceptibility to quenching with externally added DPX (11Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1362-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 12Hristova K. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11888-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Ladokhin A.S. Wimley W.C. White S.H. Biophys.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 474-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In brief, one measures the dependence of ANTS quenching inside the vesicles Q in as a function of the fraction of ANTS that has leaked out of the vesicles. If Q inis independent of the fraction of ANTS that has leaked out, then the leakage is all-or-none. If Q in increases withf out then the leakage is graded. For graded release, Q in depends onf out as follows (19Ladokhin A.S. Wimley W.C. White S.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1964-1971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar),Qin={(1+Kd[DPX]0(1-fout)a).(1+Ka[DPX]0(1-fout)a)}-1Equation 1 where [DPX]0 is the initial DPX concentration inside the vesicles, and α is the selectivity defined as the ratio of the rates of release of ANTS and DPX. The constantK d is the dynamic quenching constant, andK a is the association constant for the ANTS/DPX nonfluorescent complex. They were determined previously to be 50m−1 and 490 m−1, respectively (19Ladokhin A.S. Wimley W.C. White S.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1964-1971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The selectivity α is determined by fitting this equation to the experimental data using standard nonlinear least squares methods (19Ladokhin A.S. Wimley W.C. White S.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1964-1971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The extent of aggregation of 400 μm vesicles of E. coli whole lipid by rabbit defensins was assayed by measuring the total concentration of defensin and lipid and the concentrations remaining in solution after centrifugation of the lipid/defensin mixture in a table top centrifuge (1000 × g) for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer and also assayed. The lipid concentration was determined by fluorescence measurements using E. coli whole lipid vesicles doped with 1 mol% NBD-PE. Peptide concentration was assayed by HPLC (21Wimley W.C. White S.H. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A 50 μm solution of E. coliwhole lipid LUV containing 1 mol% of both NBD-PE and rhodamine-PE were diluted with a 10-fold excess of unlabeled E. coli whole lipid vesicles, and the defensin was added to the mixture (22Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). The fluorescence increase due to dilution of the quencher was monitored and quantitated as fractional fluorescence f F = (F final −F initial)/(F max −F initial), where F finalis the final plateau level of fluorescence,F initial is the initial quenched fluorescence, and F max is the fluorescence of 550 μm E. coli whole lipid LUV suspensions doped with 0.1 mol% of both NBD-PE and rhodamine-PE. Mixing of vesicle contents upon fusion was assayed by mixing equal amounts of ANTS- and DPX-containing LUV at 400 μm total concentration and monitoring ANTS fluorescence after the addition of defensins (23Ellens H. Bentz J. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1532-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The leakage of low molecular weight markers fromE. coli whole lipid LUV was examined using the dye/quencher pair ANTS/DPX as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown in Fig. 2 are the fractional fluorescence changes that occur following the addition of 30 μg/ml of NP-2, NP-5, or the natural mixture NP-1–5 corresponding to the naturally occurring ratio of the six rabbit defensins (26% NP-1, 17% NP-2, 6% NP-3A, 6% NP-3B, 15% NP-4, and 30% NP-5). The zero level in Fig. 2 corresponds to zero leakage, and the maximum level corresponds to complete release of ANTS/DPX. The results show that both NP-2 and NP-1–5 induce leakage of contents of E. coli whole lipid vesicles and that NP-5 does not. NP-1, NP-3A, and NP-3B behaved similarly to NP-2, whereas NP-4, like NP-5, caused no leakage (data not shown). For both NP-2 and NP-1–5, a fast initial fluorescence signal increase followed by a slower one is observed. Although particular fluorescence levels are the same as for POPG LUV (12Hristova K. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11888-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the kinetics of the increase are much faster (5–10 min versus several hours for POPG). However, we observed subtle differences in the kinetics of release. For instance, as seen in Fig. 2, NP-2 causes a faster fluorescence increase toward a plateau level than NP-1–5. Fig. 3 shows the fractional fluorescence increase f F caused by leakage from E. coli whole lipid vesicles induced by NP-2 and NP-1–5 as a function of defensin concentration. The measurements were made in the plateau region (see Fig. 2) approximately 30 min after defensin addition. f F is a sigmoidal function of defensin concentration, indicating defensin cooperativity. The results for NP-2 and NP-1–5 presented in Fig. 3 were obtained using a single LUV preparation; the exact shape varied somewhat between preparations. Also shown in Fig. 3 are measurements of increases inf F caused by leakage from various mixed lipid vesicles induced by NP-2 (see below). In our previous study of the interactions of rabbit neutrophil defensins with POPG LUV (12Hristova K. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11888-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), no synergy was observed between the six peptides despite the occurrence of antimicrobial synergy in vivo (24Lehrer R.I. Szklarek D. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1986; 52: 902-904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present case, however, there was significant synergy between NP-5 and a mixture of NP-1, NP-2, NP-3A, NP-3B, and NP-4 (NP-1–4). Fig. 4 shows the kinetics of ANTS/DPX leakage induced by 40 μg/ml NP-1–5 and by 30 μg/ml NP-1–4 mixture containing the same amounts of NP-1, NP-2, NP3A, NP-3B, and NP-4. The data reveal that although NP-5 did not cause leakage by itself (Fig. 2), it enhanced the permeabilizing properties of NP-1–4. Similarly, NP-4 enhanced the permeabilizing properties of a mixture of NP-1, NP-2, NP-3A, NP-3B, and NP-5 (data not shown). The possibility of synergy among other defensin combinations remains to be examined. The mechanism of ANTS/DPX leakage was established by the fluorescence requenching method that has been described in detail elsewhere (see “Experimental Procedures” and Refs. 11Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1362-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 12Hristova K. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11888-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, and 19Ladokhin A.S. Wimley W.C. White S.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1964-1971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, when fluorescence reaches a plateau after the addition of a particular amount of defensin, DPX is added externally to quench the released ANTS. The remaining unquenchable fluorescence is then due to the ANTS retained in the vesicles (if any). Such measurements allow one to determine the residual internal quenching Q in as a function of the fraction f out of ANTS released in a series of release experiments. As discussed under “Experimental Procedures,” if Q in is independent off out, then release is all-or-none, whereas ifQ in increases with f out, then release is graded. One can further establish in the latter case whether the release is preferential for ANTS or DPX by means of the selectivity parameter α, which is the ratio of DPX to ANTS that leaked out of the vesicles. Fig.5 A shows the results of requenching experiments for release induced by NP-2 from E. coli whole lipid vesicles. The internal quenching,Q in, of ANTS by DPX increases withf out and is above the initial level ofQ in of 0.14. The dotted line in Fig.5 A shows the result expected had the leakage been all-or-none. The solid line in Fig. 5 A is the best fit of the data to Equation 1, which yields a value for α of 1.17 ± 0.24. Similar results were obtained for NP-1–5 as shown in Fig. 5 B (α = 1.13 ± 0.26) and for NP-1, NP-3A, and NP-3B (data not shown). A χ2 test showed that these values are not statistically different from 1.0 (reduced χ2 ∼ 0.87). Thus, the experiments did not distinguish preferential leakage for ANTS or DPX, suggesting that the release of solutes occurs in a nondiscriminative manner. The nonpreferential leakage of ANTS and DPX suggested that the leakage path aperture might be much larger than the characteristic dimensions of ANTS and DPX. We therefore examined the effect of the rabbit defensins on the leakage of high molecular weight dextrans fromE. coli whole lipid vesicles. The leakage of high molecular weight compounds was examined using fluorescein-labeled dextrans (FD-4,M r = 4,400; FD-20, M r = 18,700; and FD-70, M r = 50,700). The possibility of these dextrans binding to E. coli whole lipid liposomes was examined as described elsewhere (25Ladokhin A.S. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1762-1766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). No evidence of binding was found. 2A. Ladokhin, personal communication. We took advantage of the fact that the fluorescein-dextrans self-quench as indicated by the observation that the concentration dependence of dextran fluorescence in vesicle-free solutions deviates from linearity at high concentrations (data not shown). Self-quenching concentrations of dextrans were therefore entrapped, and defensin-induced leakage was detected by increases in fluorescence due to dextran dilution during leakage. The fractional fluorescence increases off F following additions of NP-2 and NP-1–5 to solutions of 400 μm E. coli whole lipid LUV with entrapped dextrans are plotted in Fig.6 as a function of defensin concentration. All measurements were made in the plateau region of the release kinetics approximately 30–40 min after defensin addition. The zero level corresponds to vesicle fluorescence in the absence of defensins. The maximum level of fluorescence, determined by lysis of the vesicles with Triton X-100 detergent, was assigned a value of 1. For two of the NP-1–5 concentrations, we performed several experiments with different FD-70 vesicle preparations to estimate experimental variability (error bars, Fig. 6 B). Fig. 6 shows that NP-1–5 and NP-2 induce the leakage of all of the dextrans studied. Furthermore, the leakage increases with defensin concentration, up to about 20 μg/ml, and then levels off at about 40–50%, independent of dextran molecular weight. The kinetics of the leakage of ANTS/DPX and FD-20 from E. coli whole lipid vesicles induced by NP-2 are compared in Fig.7. The data show that NP-2-treated vesicles are leaky to both small molecules (ANTS/DPX) and large dextran molecules. Note, however, that although ANTS fluorescence quickly reaches its plateau level of almost 1, the fluorescence of FD-20 levels off at about 0.5 with a slower time course. The kinetics and extent of leakage of the release of FD-4 and FD-70 are very similar to those of FD-20 under similar conditions (data not shown). The data presented in Figs. 6 and 7 reveal that dextran leakage is independent of molecular weight and that it is never complete (Fig. 6). We considered the possibility that the dextran-loaded E. coli whole lipid vesicles are incapable of releasing all of their contents regardless of the leakage mechanism. To examine this possibility, we took advantage of the fact that denatured defensins (reduced disulfide bonds) induce leakage by a different mechanism than native defensins and are far more effective in causing leakage of ANTS/DPX (11Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1362-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 26Fujii G. Selsted M.E. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).

We now show that IL-2 regulation of STAT3 proteins in T cells is a complex response involving activation of two forms of STAT3: 90-kDa STAT3α and an 83-kDa carboxyl-terminal truncated STAT3β. The phosphorylation of STAT proteins on serine residues is also required for competent STAT transcription. A critical serine phosphorylation site in STAT3α is at position 727. In this study we have produced an antisera specific for STAT3α proteins phosphorylated on serine 727 and used this to monitor the phosphorylation of this residue during T lymphocyte activation. Our results show that phosphorylation of STAT3α on serine 727 is not constitutive in quiescent T cells but can be induced by the cytokine IL-2. Interestingly, triggering of the T cell antigen receptor complex or activation of protein kinase C with phorbol esters also induces phosphorylation of serine 727 but without simultaneously inducing STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation or DNA binding. Hence, the present results show that STAT3 serine phosphorylation can be regulated independently of the tyrosine phosphorylation of this molecule. IL-2 and T cell antigen receptor complex induction of STAT3α serine 727 phosphorylation is dependent on the activity of the MEK/ERK pathway. Previous studies have identified H-7-sensitive kinase pathways that regulate STAT3 DNA binding. We show that H-7-sensitive pathways regulate STAT3 DNA binding in T cells. Nevertheless, we show that H-7-sensitive kinases do not regulate STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation or phosphorylation of serine 727. These results thus show that STAT3 proteins are targets for multiple kinase pathways in T cells and can integrate signals from both cytokine receptors and antigen receptors. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) induces tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs 3 and 5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription).

STAT activation involves tyrosine phosphorylation which allows for Src homology (SH) 2 domain-mediated homodimerization or heterodimerization. Activated and tyrosine-phosphorylated STATs then translocate to the nucleus to form sequence-specific DNA binding complexes and enable cytokine-mediated gene transcription (reviewed in Ref. 20Darnell J.E.J.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 4781-4789PubMed Google Scholar). In reconstitution experiments, it has been recently shown that for STAT1 to elicit IFN-γ-mediated antigrowth activity, the serine phosphorylation site (Ser-727) is required (27Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Zilong W. Schreiber R. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7673-7678Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). We have also recently shown that IL-2 regulation of STAT5 is mediated by both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase pathways (28Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). STAT5 serine phosphorylation in T cells is regulated by an as yet uncharacterized kinase whose activity is required for STAT5 transcriptional activity. IL-2 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of STAT3. The phosphorylation of serine 727 in the STAT3 carboxyl terminus is important for STAT3 transcriptional function, but neither has there been any characterization of STAT3 serine phosphorylation nor any study of the identity of STAT3 serine kinases in T cells. Recent debates have focused particularly on the role of MEK/ERK kinase pathways in STAT activation (29Ihle J.N. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the STAT3 serine 727 kinase has not been fully resolved in any cellular system. This site forms anin vitro substrate for the MAP kinase ERKs which raised the possibility that STAT3 integrates signals from the MAP kinases. This hypothesis has not been fully explored in vivo, in particular, for certain cell systems phosphorylation of serine 727 is constitutive and in others, subject to regulation by extracellular stimuli (25Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Herein we present evidence that IL-2 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of two different forms of STAT3: 90-kDa STAT3α and 83-kDa STAT3β. IL-2 also induces serine phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3α via a MEK/ERK pathway. The present data also show that STAT3 tyrosine and serine phosphorylation can be independently regulated: activation of MAP kinases by phorbol esters or T cell antigen receptor cross-linking induces phosphorylation of STAT3α on serine 727 without concurrently inducing STAT3 DNA binding or tyrosine phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of serine 727 is not obligatory for DNA binding or tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. Nevertheless, we find a H-7-sensitive kinase pathway that does not regulate STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation or phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3α is able to modulate STAT3 DNA binding. These data collectively indicate the role of multiple T cell signaling pathways in mediating differential control over STAT activation. Kit225 cells (30Hori T. Uchiyama T. Tsudo M. Umadome H. Ohno H. Fukuhara S. Kita K. Uchino H. Blood. 1987; 70: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum and 1 nm recombinant IL-2 (Eurocetus). IL-2 receptor expressing human peripheral blood-derived T lymphoblasts were generated and maintained as described previously (31Beadling C. Guschin D. Witthuhn B.A. Ziemiecki A. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5605-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Cells were quiesced by washing three times in RPMI 1640, and replacing in RPMI 1640 with 10% serum in the absence of IL-2 for 48- 72 h. The inhibitors H-7, 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (Sigma), and PD098059 (a gift of L. O'Neill, Trinity College, Dublin) were preincubated with cells in RPMI 1640 for 30 min prior to cytokine stimulation. Recombinant IL-2 (1 nm), interferon α (1000 units/ml), or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (50 ng/ml) was incubated at indicated times. Interferon α (IFNα) was a gift from I. Kerr. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) was from Calbiochem. Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysis of approximately 10–20 × 106 cells/ml in a lysis buffer comprised of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml chymostatin. The oligonucleotide sequence used was derived from the high-affinity SIE of the c-fos gene (SIEM67) GTCGACATTTCCCGTAAATC. DNA-binding proteins were isolated from extracts of approximately 15 × 106 cells in the above buffer by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with 1 μg of double-stranded, 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide coupled to 30 μl of a 50% suspension of streptavidin-agarose (Sigma). For affinity purification of proteins binding to the phosphopeptide IFNγR Y440P, the phosphotyrosylpeptide TSFGYDKPH was coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) at 5 mg/ml, and 30 μl were used to purify binding proteins from 1 ml of cell lysate. Binding was at 4 °C for 1 h, and complexes were washed twice in lysis buffer prior to elution by boiling in reducing sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% acrylamide, 0.2% bis gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Western blot analysis was performed with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (4G10 and PY20; 1 μg/ml each; Upstate Biotechnology Inc. and Transduction Laboratories, respectively) or antibodies against STAT proteins; STAT5, STAT3, or STAT1(anti-ISGF3) (Transduction Laboratories unless indicated otherwise). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with the epichemiluminescence Western blotting system (Amersham). For the analysis of STAT3α/β immunoreactivity on Western blot analyses, the following antibodies were used: amino-terminal (residues 1–175) raised anti-STAT3 N-T fusion protein, carboxyl-terminal (residues 750–769) raised anti-STAT3 C-T peptide, and carboxyl-terminal (residues 688–727) raised anti-STAT3 C-T fusion protein (Transduction Laboratories, Santa Cruz, CA, and a gift from I. Kerr, respectively). For the analysis of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blot analysis, antibodies raised to the consensus tyrosine phosphorylation motif were used (residues 701–709); either using a tyrosine phosphopeptide (α-Py STAT3) or the equivalent non-phosphorylated peptide (α-STAT3 control). Both antibodies were from New England Biolabs. The peptide sequence corresponding to human STAT3 at site 717–736, TCSNTIDLPMSPRALDSLMQ, were synthesized with serine 727 as a phosphopeptide or a control non-phosphorylated peptide. These peptides were then coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via the glutaraldehyde coupling method. Rabbit antisera to these serine 727 phosphopeptide were generated by standard immunization protocols. Rabbit sera was screened for antigen reactivity by standard ELISA and Western blot analysis. On final screening, the phosphoserine 727 antisera was used at a dilution of 1:5000 for Western analysis and at a dilution of 1:100 for immunoprecipitation studies. Cells were lysed in the buffer used for affinity purification experiments, and proteins were concentrated by precipitation with 2.0 volumes of acetone. Proteins isolated from 1 to 3 × 106 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE using the following gel conditions: for STAT5, STAT3, Sos, and Raf-1 analysis, 7.5% acrylamide, 0.2% bisacrylamide gels and 15% acrylamide, 0.075% bisacrylamide for MAP kinase analysis. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and detected by Western blot with the indicated antisera: for STAT5 and STAT3, pan-Erk antisera (Transduction Labs.), Sos (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), Raf-1 (Santa Cruz Inc.), or phosphotyrosine STAT3 (New England Biolabs), unless indicated otherwise. Biotinylated oligonucleotides comprising the high-affinity mutant sis-inducible element (SIEM) was used to affinity purify STAT proteins from cell extracts of quiescent or IL-2-stimulated human peripheral blood-derived T lymphoblasts. The data in Fig.1 A show that IL-2 induces DNA binding of STAT3 and STAT5 in peripheral blood-derived T cells. IL-2 induced DNA binding of STAT3 and STAT5 is clearly discernible within 1 min of exposure to the cytokine and maximal by 10 min (Fig.1 A). Two forms, a 90-kDa and a 83-kDa form of STAT3 proteins, were seen in both Kit225 cells and peripheral blood-derived T lymphoblasts (Fig. 1, A and B). Previous studies have not noted STAT3 heterogeneity in T cells. However, two different STAT3 proteins of 90 and 83 kDa were detected in the IL-2 STAT·DNA complexes in both peripheral blood-derived T cells and Kit225 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Two different forms of STAT3 have been described: STAT3α and STAT3β; STAT3β being a carboxyl-terminal truncated spliced variant of a single STAT3 gene (32Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar,33Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T. Solari R. Armstrong J. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.-W.J. Koenderman L. de Groot R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13221-13227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To further characterize the 90- and 83-kDa IL-2 induced STAT3 proteins (termed hereafter as STAT3α and STAT3β, respectively), antisera raised against different domains of STAT3 were used in Western blot analyses of the STAT3 proteins in total T cell lysates and in DNA binding complexes (Fig. 1 B). Additionally, a tyrosine phosphopeptide comprising the tyrosine-phosphorylation site (Tyr-440) of the γ-interferon receptor α-chain was used to generate an affinity matrix for the purification of STAT3 from cell extracts. The data in Fig. 1 B show that antisera raised against an NH2-terminal STAT3 fusion protein and antisera generated against a fusion protein comprising residues 688–727 of STAT3 recognize two STAT3 proteins in T cell lysates and in the Tyr-440 peptide complexes. They also recognize both IL-2-induced STAT3 proteins in SIEM DNA binding complexes. In contrast, antisera raised against a COOH-terminal STAT3 peptide comprising residues 750–769 recognize only the 90-kDa STAT3 and not the 83-kDa protein (Fig. 1 B). The 83-kDa STAT3β protein in T cells thus corresponds to the recently described carboxyl-terminal truncated spliced variant of STAT3 (32Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar,33Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T. Solari R. Armstrong J. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.-W.J. Koenderman L. de Groot R.P. J. Biol.

Activated and tyrosine phosphorylated STAT proteins were readily detected in STAT3 immunoprecipitates prepared from IL-2 activated T cells using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies raised to the tyrosine phosphorylation site of STAT3 (Tyr-705) (Fig.2).Figure 2Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is detected using phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)-705) STAT3 antibodies in IL-2 and interferon α-treated cells. Total lysates were prepared from unstimulated (lanes 1, 4, and 7), IL-2 (lanes 2, 5, and 8), or interferon α (lanes 3, 6, and 9)-treated Kit225 cells and subjected to immunoprecipitation using an antibody raised to residues (750–769) of STAT3. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)-705) STAT3 (lanes 1–3), STAT3 (lanes 4–6), and STAT5 (lanes 7–9) antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) There was a discernible reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of STAT3α but not STAT3β isolated from IL-2-activated Kit225 cells and in IL-2 activated peripheral blood T lymphoblasts (Fig.3 A and data not shown). Both forms of STAT3α (termed s, slow, and f, fast; for the different electrophoretic mobility shift properties) can equally bind DNA upon IL-2 activation and are both tyrosine-phosphorylated. The ability of STAT3α to undergo an electrophoretic mobility shift in response to IL-2 could reflect IL-2-regulated serine phosphorylation of STAT3. There is a serine phosphorylation site at residue 727 in STAT3α that is required for transcriptional activation (25Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Generation of phosphorylation state-specific antibodies has been described previously (34Czernik A.J. Girault J-A Nairn A.C. Chen J. Synder G. Kebabian J. Greengard P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 264-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and had been shown to be successful in the analysis of site-specific phosphorylations of a variety of proteins (35Drago G.A. Colyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25073-25077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Coghlan M.P. Pillay T.S. Tavare J.M. Siddle K. Biochem.

Cell. 1993; 4: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), including transcription factors (38Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Thus to circumvent radiolabeling techniques and to explore whether IL-2 is inducing the phosphorylation of STAT3α on serine 727, we generated rabbit antisera selectively reactive to a phosphopeptide corresponding to the serine 727 site in STAT3. The selectivity of this antisera for the phosphorylated serine 727 STAT3 peptide compared with the nonphosphorylated peptide is shown by ELISA (Fig. 3 B). The phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera could weakly immunoprecipitate STAT3α proteins from quiescent peripheral blood-derived T cells but levels of STAT3α immunoprecipitable with the phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera were increased markedly in cells lysates isolated from IL-2 stimulated T cells (Fig. 4 A). The carboxyl-terminal truncated STAT3β protein lacking the serine 727 site could not be immunoprecipitated with the phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera from either quiescent or IL-2-activated cells. On Western blot analysis, IL-2 induced STAT3α DNA bound proteins were also reactive with the phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera (Fig. 4 B). The reactivity of the phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera with STAT3α proteins isolated from IL-2-activated T cells could be blocked by competition with the phosphorylated serine 727 STAT3 peptide but not the nonphosphorylated peptide (data not shown). STAT3 proteins, affinity purified using the IFNγR Tyr-440 tyrosine phosphopeptide matrix were similarily analyzed for immunoreactivity with the phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera. There was a low level reactivity of phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera with STAT3 proteins isolated from quiescent cells but this was markedly increased upon IL-2 stimulation (Fig. 4 C). No reactivity of phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera with STAT3β could be detected. These data collectively show that IL-2 induces serine phosphorylation of STAT3α on serine 727 in peripheral blood-derived T lymphoblasts. Xenopus MAP kinase can phosphorylate STAT1in vitro at the carboxyl terminus consensus MAPK phosphorylation site (25Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). The equivalent in vitro ERK site in STAT3 is serine 727. To explore directly the role of the MEK/ERK pathway in STAT3 regulation by IL-2 we used an inhibitor of the ERK stimulatory kinase, MAP kinase kinase (MEK), PD098059. The specificity of PD098059 as a MEK inhibitor has been previously described (39Dudley D. Pang L. Decker S. Bridges A. Saltiel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar, 40Alessi D. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). To monitor the effectiveness of the MEK inhibitor in T cells, we examined the phosphorylation of ERK induced by IL-2 in T cells pretreated with PD098059. As an additional means to monitor ERK activation in IL-2-treated cells, hyperphosphorylation of ERK substrates were also analyzed. Cellular substrates for ERK in T cells, as in many cells, include the p21ras effector molecule Raf-1, and the guanine nucleotide exchange protein Sos (41Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1485-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 42Rozakis-Adcock M. van der Geer P. Mbamalu G. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1417-1426PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are both upstream regulators of the MAP kinases, but are phosphorylated by the MAP kinases through feedback signaling mechanisms. Hyperphosphorylated ERK, Raf-1, and Sos have reduced electrophoretic mobility when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The data in Fig.5 A show that IL-2 regulated hyperphosphorylation of ERK, Sos, and Raf-1 are inhibited by the MEK inhibitor PD098059, demonstrating that this inhibitor is effective at blocking the MEK/ERK pathway in T cells. Analysis of STAT3α and STAT3β in DNA bound complexes (Fig. 5 B) shows that IL-2 induced changes in STAT3α electrophoretic mobility were inhibited by the MEK inhibitor PD098059, however, this inhibitor did not prevent IL-2 induced DNA binding of STAT3. To examine directly the effects of PD098059 on IL-2 induced phosphorylation of serine 727 of STAT3α we used the phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera. The data in Fig. 5 C shows a marked increase in reactivity of the phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera with STAT3α, isolated from IL-2-activated T cells. This increased reactivity was inhibited in STAT3α proteins isolated from IL-2-treated T cells that had been preincubated with the MEK inhibitor PD098059. Hence, inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway prevents the IL-2-induced phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3α. The phorbol ester PDBu stimulates protein kinase C and activates the ERK/MAP kinase pathway independently of IL-2 receptor activation. If STAT3α is regulated by MEK/ERK then one possibility is that PDBu, which activates ERK via a protein kinase C/Raf-1 pathway independent of IL-2, could also induce the phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3α. This is assuming that serine phosphorylation of STAT proteins can proceed independently of their tyrosine phosphorylation. The data in Fig.6 A show that PDBu did not induce changes in the electrophoretic mobility of STAT5 but similar to IL-2, PDBu induced changes in the electrophoretic mobility of STAT3α but not STAT3β. Moreover, immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses of STAT3 proteins showed that PDBu induced STAT3α reactivity with the phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera (Fig. 6 B,panels a andb). PDBu did not induce DNA binding of STAT3 probably because of the failure of phorbol esters to induce STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 6 C and data not shown). The PDBu data thus show that phosphorylation of STAT3α on serine 727 can occur independently of DNA binding or tyrosine phosphorylation. Phorbol esters are pharmacological activators of the ERK pathway and to examine whether a more physiological signal for ERK activation can induce phosphorylation of STAT3 proteins in the absence of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, we examined the effects of triggering the T cell antigen receptor complex on STAT3. Previous studies have shown that triggering of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) complex does not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (31Beadling C. Guschin D. Witthuhn B.A. Ziemiecki A. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5605-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, the data in Fig. 6 D show that STAT3α proteins isolated from TCR-activated T cells are reactive with the phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera compared with the weak reactivity seen in STAT3α proteins isolated from quiescent T cells. These results show that STAT3α can be phosphorylated on serine 727 in response to triggering the TCR complex. This effect is prevented by pretreating T cells with the MEK inhibitor PD098059; consistent with a model in which TCR regulation of the phosphorylation of serine 727 being mediated by the MEK/ERK pathway (Fig. 6 D). The data above show that IL-2 regulates a MEK-sensitive serine kinase that is acting on serine 727 in the COOH terminus of STAT3α. The activity of this MEK-dependent pathway is not necessary or sufficient for induction of STAT3α DNA binding (Fig. 5 B and 6C, respectively). Although the MEK inhibitor PD098059 inhibits STAT3α serine 727 phosphorylation (Fig. 5 C), the data in Fig.7 A show that pretreatment of T cells with the MEK inhibitor does not abrogate IL-2 induced STAT3α/β tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 7 A, lane 2 versus lane 3). Thus, although the MEK pathway can control STAT3α phosphorylation on serine 727, its activity is not required for IL-2 induced DNA binding of STAT3α or STAT3β or tyrosine phosphorylation. In certain cells, cytokine induction of STAT3 DNA binding can be regulated by a serine kinase pathway sensitive to the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor H-7 (24Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). H-7 does not block the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway in T cells (28Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) but the role of H-7-sensitive kinases in IL-2/STAT3 regulation in T cells had not been examined. We considered the possibility that STAT3 could be regulated by two different serine kinases. We therefore examined the effect of H-7 pretreatment of T cells on IL-2 regulation of STAT3. The data in Fig. 7 B shows that IL-2 induced STAT3α/β DNA binding was inhibited in T cells pretreated with H-7. H-7 did not inhibit IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3α/β (Fig. 7 A, lane 2 versus 7). The effect of H-7 on STAT3 DNA binding showed selectivity since this inhibitor did not prevent IL-2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 or STAT5 (Fig. 7 A). Nor was DNA binding of STAT5 proteins affected by H-7 (Fig. 7 B) although as described previously, H-7 inhibits the generation of the serine-phosphorylated STAT5 p2 form as shown by the effect of H-7 on IL-2-induced electrophoretic mobility shift of STAT5 proteins. (28Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7 B). The inhibitor H-7 also did not prevent the formation of hyperphosphorylated STAT3α in IL-2-activated cells in contrast to the effects of the MEK inhibitor PD098059 (Fig. 7 A lane 7 versus lane 3, respectively). Concurrently, STAT3α proteins from IL-2 activated, H-7-pretreated T cells were also reactive with phosphoserine 727 STAT3 antisera (Fig. 7 C), demonstrating that H-7 in T cells does not inhibit IL-2-induced phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3α. Thus, H-7 inhibits IL-2 induction of STAT3 DNA bound complexes without preventing tyrosine phosphorylation or phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3α. The present study reveals that IL-2 activates DNA binding of two forms of STAT3 in T cells: 90-kDa STAT3α and an 83-kDa carboxyl-terminal truncated STAT3β. We show moreover that STAT3 proteins are both tyrosine- and serine-phosphorylated in IL-2-activated T cells. Notably, we developed a specific antibody reactive with phosphorylated serine 727 in STAT3α and show that STAT3α is regulated by a MEK regulated pathway that is not required for STAT3 DNA binding but which specifically targets the site serine 727 required for STAT3α maximal transcriptional activity (25Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). The present results also reveal that phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3α is not only regulated by IL-2 but can be regulated by the TCR or phorbol esters (Fig. 8). IL-2 activation of STAT3 concurrently induces phosphorylation on serine 727 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. However, STAT3 phosphorylation on serine 727 in response to TCR ligation or phorbol esters occurs without concomitant induction of tyrosine phosphorylation or DNA binding of STAT3. Accordingly, the serine and tyrosine phosphorylation pathways that target the STATs can be controlled independently by extracellular stimuli. A continual challenge in T cell biology is to understand the mechanisms that regulate the immune specificity of T cell responses. Phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3α is required for maximal STAT3 transcriptional activity (25Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). The ability of T cells to respond to TCR triggering by inducing phosphorylation of STAT3 on a residue that is key for STAT3 transcriptional activity reveals that in T cells there is “crosstalk” regulation of the STATs by members of the antigen receptor family. This allows the transcriptional activity of STAT3α in T cells to be linked to the immune activation status of the cells; a link which may facilitate the immune specificity of T cell responses. The inhibitor H-7 has been one tool with which to explore STAT serine kinases in a variety of cell systems, particularly, the regulation of STAT3 by H-7-sensitive kinases has been described. Because of these previous experiments with H-7 we were prompted to see whether H-7 could regulate the phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3α. The present study shows that IL-2-induced STAT3 DNA binding can be regulated by a H-7-sensitive pathway. Nevertheless, the H-7-sensitive pathway does not regulate STAT3α serine 727 phosphorylation. The H-7 target is unknown but is intriguing because of the effects of H-7 on STAT3 DNA binding. The simplest interpretation of the H-7 data is that STAT3α integrates signals from two serine kinase pathways in T cells: a MEK-regulated pathway and a H-7-sensitive pathway. These pathways are independent as H-7 does not prevent IL-2 activation of the MEK/ERK2 pathway (28Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) or the phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3α. H-7, however, does inhibit IL-2-activated STAT3 DNA binding in T cells. Conversely, the MEK/ERK2 pathway regulates phosphorylation of serine 727 in STAT3α but is not necessary for IL-2 induced STAT3 DNA binding. The regulation of both STAT3α and STAT3β DNA binding indicates that the H-7-sensitive pathway must regulate a site outside the variant carboxyl termini of the two forms of STAT3. It is possible that through a H-7-sensitive kinase, phosphorylation at, or close to, the DNA-binding domain increases DNA binding affinity of STAT3 proteins. Nevertheless, it is also possible that the H-7 effect on STAT3 proteins is indirect and mediated through association with other transcription factors or co-factors; H-7-inhibited phosphorylation of these associated factors could contribute to a loss in STAT3 DNA binding affinity. We have shown previously that IL-2 activation of STAT5 involves the convergent action of both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases (28Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The STAT5 serine kinase is H-7 sensitive and not regulated by MEK and cannot be stimulated by activators of the MAP kinase cascade (28Beadling C. Ng J. Babbage J.W. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1902-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Herein we show that the STAT3 727 serine kinase is sensitive to a MEK inhibitor and can be stimulated by receptors that activate the MEK cascade independently of STAT tyrosine phosphorylation. The involvement of the MEK pathway clearly distinguishes IL-2 regulation of STAT3α and STAT5 and shows how a single cytokine working in the same cell can use distinct serine kinase pathways to regulate different STATs. There has been considerable debate as to the identity of STAT serine kinases. The present results show that regarding the identity of STAT serine kinases may reflect that cytokines can target STATs involving multiple and functionally different serine kinase pathways. The MEK/ERK pathway is known to have an essential role in the activation responses of mature T cells and in thymocyte differentiation: the transition of thymocytes from double negative to double positive cells requires MEK/ERK2 activity as does positive selection of thymocytes (43Alberola-Ila J. Hogquist K.A. Swan K.A. Bevan M.J. Perlmutter R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 44Crompton T. Gilmour K.C. Owen M.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of this pathway, few MEK regulated pathways have been identified in T lymphocytes. We now show that serine 727, a residue critical for STAT3 function, is a substrate for the action of the MEK in T cells. Interestingly, serine 727 in STAT3α can be phosphorylated by the MEK/ERK pathway not only in response to the cytokine IL-2 but also in response to triggering of the antigen receptor complex. The present results demonstrate serine phosphorylation of residue 727 can occur independently of STAT3α tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that the regulation of STAT3 DNA binding and maximal transcriptional activity are separate processes. These data collectively reveal the complexity of STAT regulation and show that STATs are not only targets for members of the cytokine receptor family in T cells but can also integrate diverse MAP kinase signals notably, signals from antigen receptors.

Cell-specific expression of eukaryotic genes involves the functional interaction of sets of transcription factors that interact with essential cis-acting promoter regions to initiate RNA transcription. The repertoires of transcription factors that are involved in the expression of genes in highly differentiated cells often consist of those ubiquitously expressed in many cell types in cooperation with others whose expression are cell type-restricted (1Hayashi S.

Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 459-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Little information is available to explain the highly restricted expression of the TSHβ subunit gene to this small population of thyrotrope cells. To study these thyrotrope-specific factors, we have utilized the TtT-97 tumor model, which consists of a homogeneous thyrotrope cell population that expresses the TSHβ gene without the confounding influence of other pituitary cell types (4Ross D.S. Downing M.F. Chin W.W. Kieffer J.D. Ridgway E.C. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 2050-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Characterization of the transcription factors present in thyrotropes that functionally interact with this promoter will enhance our understanding of the pivotal role they may play in pituitary development and in the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype.Cell-specific activity of the mouse TSHβ promoter in thyrotrope cells requires sequences located between −270 and −80 of the 5′-flanking region (5Gordon D.F.

Within this broad area, four DNase I protected regions have been identified using nuclear extracts from TSHβ expressing mouse TtT-97 thyrotropic tumor cells (7Alexander L.M. Gordon D.F. Wood W.M.

Recently, using scanning mutagenesis, DNase I footprinting, and gene transfer studies, we have focused on the contribution of the functionally important proximal P1 region to TSHβ gene expression in thyrotropes (10Haugen B.R. McDermott M.T. Gordon D.F. Rupp C.L. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 385-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Selected mutations in the P1 region resulted in loss of DNA binding of at least two different thyrotropic nuclear proteins in TtT-97 thyrotrope cells. We previously identified the more distal of these two binding proteins as the POU homeodomain Pit-1 transcription factor (9Gordon D.F. Haugen B.R. Sarapura V.D. Nelson A.R. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 96: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Haugen B.R. McDermott M.T. Gordon D.F. Rupp C.L. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 385-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). By Southwestern blot analysis, we determined that the more proximal factor is a 50-kDa protein, which binds adjacent to the Pit-1 consensus sequence where its binding is independent of Pit-1. Targeted mutagenesis showed that when the binding of either Pit-1 or the 50-kDa protein was disrupted, functional promoter activity was reduced by 60–80% to a level exhibited by a minimal −80/+43 promoter fragment that lacks the P1 region (10Haugen B.R.

Thus, full TSHβ promoter activity required the functional participation of both Pit-1 and an additional protein at the P1 promoter region.Pit-1 is a transcription factor present in somatotropes, lactotropes, and thyrotropes of the anterior pituitary (11Bodner M.

In the P1 region of the mTSHβ, gene an imperfect consensus sequence occurs twice on the antisense strand at positions −122 to −114 and −107 to −100. Mutations that disrupt either of these sites abrogated Pit-1 binding and dramatically lowered functional promoter activity (10Haugen B.R. McDermott M.T. Gordon D.F. Rupp C.L. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 385-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a mutation that drastically altered the downstream site was without detrimental effect on binding or function. Other studies have shown that regulation of TSHβ promoter activity by TRH or cyclic AMP colocalized with Pit-1 binding sites and that mutations of these consensus sequences blunted the stimulatory effect (18Steinfelder H.J. Hauser P. Nakayama Y. Radovick S. McClaskey J.H. Taylor T. Weintraub B.D. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Given this information, it is reasonable to speculate that Pit-1 may be important for both basal and hormone-stimulated activity of the TSHβ promoter. However, additional factors most likely are involved in regulating basal activity, since the endogenous TSHβ gene is not expressed in Pit-1 containing lactotrope and somatotrope cells. Furthermore, the addition of Pit-1 alone was not sufficient to stimulate TSHβ promoter activity in αTSH cells that lack endogenous Pit-1 (9Gordon D.F. Haugen B.R. Sarapura V.D. Nelson A.R. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 96: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Finally, we have recently shown that a mutation that disrupts binding of a 50-kDa thyrotropic protein without disrupting Pit-1 binding to the adjacent site diminished promoter activity in transfected TtT-97 thyrotrope cells (10Haugen B.R.

The GATA transcription factor family consists of six members, GATA-1 through -6. In general, they are approximately 50 kDa in size (hGATA-2) and contain a highly conserved DNA-binding domain consisting of two zinc fingers, and although originally found in cells of hematopoietic lineage (23Yamamoto M.

GATA factors have been shown to functionally interact with other classes of transcription factors such as AP1 (25Kawana M. Lee M. Quertermous E.E. Quertermous T. Mol. Cell.

Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3147-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The AGATAA sequence is also present in the human, equine, and mouse α-subunit promoters, and Steger et al.(30Steger D.J.,. Hecht J.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5592-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that GATA family members are involved in both pituitary and placental expression of the α-glycoprotein hormone gene that encodes the common subunit of TSH, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and chorionic gonadotropin. In the current study, we present data showing that the 50-kDa protein in thyrotropes that binds to the proximal P1 region of the mTSHβ promoter and functionally synergizes with Pit-1 is likely to be GATA-2.DISCUSSIONThe absolute restriction of thyrotropin β-subunit expression to the pituitary thyrotrope suggests that its transcription is governed by an exclusive interaction between the TSHβ gene promoter and cell-specific transcription factors. To date, little information is available about which factors are necessary and sufficient to allow high levels of basal transcription in these cells. Our observations define the participation of two different classes of transcription factors to synergize on a closely spaced response element within the proximal P1 promoter region and demonstrate a functional ternary protein-DNA complex involving the pituitary-specific factor, Pit-1. Such composite elements have been described for a number of interacting transcription factors in other systems (53Miner J.N. Yamamoto K.R.

Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and provide a mechanism for their combinatorial action within a regulatory network. The analysis of the mTSHβ gene described in this report provides evidence for the participation of a zinc finger factor, GATA-2, with a POU homeodomain partner, Pit-1, on a such a composite element and may be a general mechanism in which other GATA family members can functionally and physically interact with other homeodomain partners.A number of lines of evidence point to the fact that the pituitary-restricted factor, Pit-1, is necessary but not sufficient to allow basal transcription of the mTSHβ gene. Pit-1 is expressed in thyrotropes, lactotropes, and somatotropes of the anterior pituitary (13Li S. Crenshaw E.B. Rawson E.J. Simmons D.M. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1990; 347: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 14Camper S.A. Saunders T.L. Katz R.W. Reeves R.H. Genomics. 1990; 8: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), while TSH expression is restricted solely to the thyrotrope cell population. While it is clear that Pit-1 is critical for thyrotrope ontogeny, the role of Pit-1 in governing TSHβ gene expression in thyrotropes is less well understood. Several reports have shown that when using a transfection reconstitution system, Pit-1 alone fails to transactivate TSHβ promoter activity using 1.2 kb of 5′-flanking DNA in either pituitary or nonpituitary cells (9Gordon D.F. Haugen B.R. Sarapura V.D. Nelson A.R. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 96: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 56Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In contrast, a marked enhancement of TSHβ promoter activity resulted when other pituitary factors were cotransfected with Pit-1 such as P-lim (57Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse R.V., II Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) or a unique thyrotrope-specific Pit-1 isoform, termed Pit-1T (58Haugen B.R. Wood W.M. Gordon D.F. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20818-20824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 59Haugen B.R. Gordon D.F. Nelson A.R. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1574-1582PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of P-lim in TSHβ activation is not clear, since it is also present in GH3 somatomammotrope cells, which do not express endogenous TSHβ. It is unlikely to interact with the P1 region, which we demonstrated to be of importance in the present study, since P-lim clearly does not bind to the −120 to −60 region, which contains the P1 region, unless the LIM domain was deleted (57Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse R.V., II Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Moreover, such a truncated form of this protein lacking the LIM domain has not been demonstrated in thyrotropes. Thus, it is unlikely that P-lim accounts for the extended footprint found with thyrotropic nuclear extracts. In this report, we provide evidence that GATA-2 is the predominant GATA factor in thyrotrope cells, can functionally synergize with Pit-1 on juxtaposed sites in the P1 region, and in vitro can form a protein-protein interaction. This combinatorial interaction likely participates in TSHβ gene expression in thyrotropes.Synergistic interaction involving Pit-1 with other transcription factors on a variety of pituitary hormone genes has also been reported. On the growth hormone gene promoter, Pit-1 has been shown to synergize with Zn-15 (60Lipkin S.M. Naar A.M. Kalla K.A. Sack R.A. Rosenfeld M.G.

The sites of synergy with Pit-1 have been examined for several of these interactions. Synergy with Zn-15 grossly mapped to the amino-terminal transactivation domain of Pit-1 (60Lipkin S.M. Naar A.M. Kalla K.A. Sack R.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), while a smaller Pit-1 deletion, lacking amino acids 72–100, eliminated synergism with thyroid hormone receptor without affecting independent transcriptional activation on the rat growth hormone gene (61Chang W. Zhou W. Theill L.E. Baxter J.D. Schaufele F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17733-17738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast, the site of interaction of Pit-1 with the estrogen receptor mapped to amino acids 45–72 (71Holloway J.M. Szeto D.P. Scully K.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1992-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), while the interaction with Oct-1 mapped to the POU homeodomain, consisting of amino acids 210–273 (69Voss J.W. Wilson L. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, levels of expressed protein from these Pit-1 mutant constructs compared with wild type Pit-1 were not reported, and loss of function could be due to inefficient expression. Thus, Pit-1 may contain or provide a number of distinct domains, each of whose function or accessibility is dependent on the specific cis-acting promoter sequence and its synergistic transcription partner. Future studies will define the synergistic domains of Pit-1 with GATA-2 on the TSHβ promoter, as well as the specific sites of protein-protein interaction. Such factor interactions with Pit-1 may represent a more general mechanism whereby a tissue-restricted homeodomain factor can recruit widely expressed factors to a particular composite element and integrate high levels of tissue-specific gene expression, as has been proposed by Gutierrez-Hartmann's group (64Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2849-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 65Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Tran P.H. Ostrowski M.C. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24639-24648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).The GATA family of transcription factors are also somewhat tissue-restricted in their expression. GATA-1 was the first member of the family to be discovered, and its expression is generally restricted to erythroid cells, mast cells, and megakaryocytes, where it binds to a consensus sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G) by virtue of its two zinc finger domains and plays a pivotal role in erythropoiesis (72Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). GATA-2 is expressed in a wide variety of tissues; GATA-3 is most abundantly expressed in T lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and in the developing nervous system; GATA-4 is generally restricted to the heart and gonads (32Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Steger et al. (30Steger D.J.,. Hecht J.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5592-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that GATA transcription factors play a role in pituitary α-subunit gene expression. They detected GATA-2 and a mouse GATA-4-related protein in gonadotrope-derived αT3 cells and showed that both GATA-2 and -3 can activate α-subunit gene promoter activity 3-fold. The GATA site responsible for this activity mapped just upstream of the cyclic AMP-responsive site within the proximal 180 bp of the 5′-flanking region. In TSHβ-expressing thyrotropic tumor cells, a majority of the GATA transcripts were GATA-2, since the pattern of hybridization was identical when using a GATA-2-specific probe or with a probe only containing the conserved DNA-binding domain. Additionally, using a common DNA-binding domain probe from mGATA-3 in a cDNA library screening, all of the clones we isolated contained GATA-2 sequences. There was, however, a low but detectable level of GATA-3 expression in these cells, and we cannot rule out its contribution in activating the TSHβ promoter. However, we failed to detect any GATA-4 transcripts in TtT-97 thyrotropes, although a nonabundant GATA-4 transcript was detected in non-TSHβ-expressing αTSH cells. Finally, it is interesting to speculate that GATA-2 may also transactivate the α-subunit gene promoter in thyrotrope cells where it may coordinately regulate both subunits of thyrotropin.Two transcripts for GATA-2 have also been reported for the human protein. Structural analysis of human genomic DNA clones encoding GATA-2 coupled with RNA blot analysis demonstrated that the observed molecular heterogeneity is due to alternative use of two polyadenylation consensus sequences, which are 612 bp apart within exon 6 (73Nagai T. Harigae H. Ishihara H. Motohashi H. Minegishi N. Tsucyiya S. Hayashi N. Gu L. Andres B. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Blood. 1994; 84: 1074-1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sizes of the mouse GATA-2 transcripts that we detected (3.7 and 3.1 kb, Fig. 2) in thyrotrope RNA also differ by 600 nucleotides and are also most likely the result of alternative polyadenylation sites. It is of interest that αTSH cells, a thyrotrope-derived cell line that expresses the α-subunit gene but not TSHβ, contains transcripts for GATA-2 and GATA-3. However, although this cell line contains Pit-1 transcripts, Pit-1 protein was not detected (9Gordon D.F. Haugen B.R. Sarapura V.D. Nelson A.R. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 96: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GH3 cells, which express growth hormone and prolactin but not TSHβ, contain Pit-1 transcripts and protein but lack transcripts for GATA-2. Moreover, the 50-kDa protein, identified as GATA-2 in the present study, was not detected in GH3extracts by Southwestern blot analysis with the proximal P1 probe (10Haugen B.R. McDermott M.T. Gordon D.F. Rupp C.L. Wood W.M. Ridgway E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 385-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These data suggest that both factors must be present in the same cell for TSHβ gene expression. Studies are ongoing in our laboratory to stably express modulated levels of Pit-1 protein in αTSH cells or GATA-2 in GH3 cells and determine whether endogenous TSHβ expression can then be detected. Of course, additional factors that interact with GATA-2 and/or Pit-1 may also be required for full TSHβ reconstitution.The role of GATA-2 in pituitary thyrotrope development has yet to be determined. Recently, GATA-2 has been shown to be essential for normal mouse development. The targeted disruption of the GATA-2 gene resulted in the death of the embryos by embryonic day 10 or 11. This was due to a severe anemia that developed because of the critical role that GATA-2 plays in the regulation of genes controlling growth factor responsiveness or the proliferative capacity of early hematopoietic cells (74Tsai F. Keller G. Kuo F.C. Weiss M. Chen J. Rosenblatt M. Alt F.W. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, thyrotrope function could not be assessed in this model, since TSHβ markers are first detected in the mouse pituitary gland during embryonic days 12.5–14.5 (13Li S. Crenshaw E.B. Rawson E.J. Simmons D.M. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1990; 347: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 75Lin S-C. Li S. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Development. 1994; 120: 515-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During pituitary development, a transient population of TSHβ-expressing thyrotropes appears in the rostral tip and is present before Pit-1 is expressed (75Lin S-C. Li S. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Development. 1994; 120: 515-522Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells do express thyrotrope embryonic factor (56Drolet D.W. Scully K.M. Simmons D.M. Wegner M. Chu K. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), but it is yet to be determined whether GATA-2 is present and plays a role in TSHβ expression within this initial thyrotrope population as we have shown in mature thyrotropes.

The downstream targets that mediate the effects of Cdc42 on the actin cytoskeleton have yet to be fully identified. We have used the transient transfection of COS-7 cells with epitope-tagged Cdc42 to identify candidate signaling partners for this GTPase and identified the IQGAP protein as a major in vivo target for activated Cdc42. Epidermal growth factor stimulation of serum-starved COS-7 cells promoted the formation of a Cdc42-IQGAP complex, indicating that growth factors can increase the pool of activated Cdc42. Activated HA-Cdc42 co-localized with IQGAP or F-actin in vivo, whereas cells transfected with dominant-negative forms of Cdc42 (Cdc42T17N) showed predominantly dispersed distributions for both HA-Cdc42 and endogenous IQGAP. In detergent lysates from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with different forms of Cdc42, or from stably transfected CHO cells, the induction of actin polymerization by phalloidin resulted in the incorporation of both IQGAP and Cdc42 into actin-containing complexes. Taken together, these findings are consistent with a model whereby IQGAP serves as a target for GTP-bound Cdc42 providing a direct link between the activated GTPase and the actin cytoskeleton.

Microinjection of activated forms of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 give rise to changes in the underlying actin structures of cells, as manifested by an increase in the number and extent of actin stress fibers (Rho (11Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar)), lamellipodia (Rac (12Ridley A. Paterson H. Johnston C. Diekman D.

Despite numerous studies using microinjection and genetic approaches to demonstrate the importance of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 in these processes, little is known about the protein-protein interactions that give rise to these morphological changes. To identify specific targets for Cdc42, which may play critical roles in mediating the effects of this GTPase on the actin cytoskeleton and cell morphology, we have used epitope-tagged mutant forms of Cdc42 to facilitate co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies in transfected cell populations. In this study, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that a major target of the activated form of Cdc42 in mammalian cells is IQGAP1, a previously described protein possessing a Ras-GTPase activating domain (3Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M. Snijders A. Murthy A. Yan Y. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We show that Cdc42 and IQGAP associate in response to the addition of EGF, 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; HA, hemagglutinin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). demonstrating the activation of cellular Cdc42 via growth factor-stimulated pathways. Cdc42 is seen to co-localize with endogenous IQGAP and actin in transfected COS-7 cells, giving rise to numerous pleated structures, and to co-immunoprecipitate with these proteins in an F-actin- and GTP-dependent manner. Our results suggest that the assembly of a stable complex containing Cdc42, IQGAP, and F-actin is regulated by the GTPase activity of Cdc42. The affinity-purified antibody recognizing IQGAP1 was raised in rabbits injected with the amino-terminal half of Sf9-expressed IQGAP1 as described previously (4Hart M. Callow M. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody 12CA5 specifically recognizing the hemagglutinin (HA) peptide YPYDVPDYA was purchased as mouse ascites from Berkeley Antibody Corp. Anti-actin (rabbit) antibody was purchased from Sigma. Other chemicals were purchased as standard reagent grade and were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. COS-7 cells (ATCC) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and plated overnight prior to transfection. Plasmids encoding mutant forms of Cdc42 were constructed by ligating the BamHI-EcoRI Cdc42 coding sequence from pGEX-KG into the mammalian transfection plasmid pKH3 (a generous gift of I. Macara, University of Virginia) containing the oligonucleotide coding region for three tandem amino-terminal hemagglutinin epitope sequences as described previously (5Mattingly R. Sorisky A. Brann M. Macara I. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 7943-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with purified pKH3Cdc42 plasmid preparations using the LipofectAMINETM protocol as per manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Approximately 24 h post-transfection, cells were trypsinized and replated onto glass coverslips (22 × 22 mm; Corning) and assayed between 48 and 72 h post-transfection. CHO cells were stably transfected with the wild-type pKHA3 construct of Cdc42 at a 10:1 ratio with a plasmid encoding G418 resistance. [35S]Methionine metabolic labeling was carried out using 20 mCi of Tran35S-label® on 100-mm tissue culture plates of transfected COS-7 cells (24 h post-transfection) for 15 h in 4 ml of methionine/cysteine-free DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 15 h of labeling, cells were rinsed in PBS (10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl), harvested in lysis buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and treated as described below for non-radioactive immunoprecipitations. Transfected COS-7 cells were lysed 48–72 h post-transfection (1 × 105cells/35-mm well) in ice-cold detergent lysis buffer for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were transferred to pre-chilled tubes and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove detergent-insoluble material. Supernatants were rocked for 2 h (4 °C) after addition of mouse ascites containing anti-HA antibody. Immune complexes were isolated by adding 20 ml of suspended protein A-Sepharose beads (100 mg of swollen beads/ml) to each tube and rocking for 2 h. Samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 2 min. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer for 10 min each before resuspension of the beads in 50 ml of SDS sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% acrylamide gels and transferred overnight to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 2% dry milk in TBS-Tween (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween) for 1 h, membranes were probed with primary antibodies as indicated. After 3 washes of 30 min each in TBS-Tween, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000 in TBS-Tween buffer), washed 3 times with 20 ml of TBS-Tween, and visualized with ECL (Amersham). Transfected COS-7 cells were replated 24 h post-transfection onto glass coverslips and allowed to adhere (for 24–48 h) before fixation for 10 min with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. Following 3 washes with PBS (10 min each), cells were permeabilized for 5 min in PBS-containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and washed three times in PBS. For indirect immunofluorescence of epitope-tagged Cdc42, a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5) was used 1:100. For localization of endogenous IQGAP, a polyclonal antibody raised against the amino terminus of recombinant IQGAP1 was used at a dilution of 1:50. Diluted primary antibodies were incubated with the fixed and permeabilized cells for 2 h at 22 °C. After washing the primary antibodies for 30 min with PBS, secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) conjugated to rhodamine (anti-mouse; 1:200 dilution) or Bodipy® (anti-rabbit; 1:100 dilution) fluorophores were incubated for 1 h at room temperature prior to the mounting of coverslips with non-fade medium (Kirkegaard and Perry, Gaithersburg, MD). F-actin was visualized by incubating fixed and permeabilized cells with rhodamine phalloidin (1:20 dilution of a 1 mg/ml stock in ethanol; Molecular Probes) in the secondary incubation step. Cells expressing HA3-tagged Cdc42 were resuspended and lysed at 1 × 106 cell eq/ml with 10 strokes of a 50-ml glass homogenizer in actin polymerization buffer (150 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm K2HPO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin). Following a 10-min incubation on ice, the lysate was spun for 90 min at 170,000 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman type Ti-50 fixed angle rotor. The supernatant was aliquoted into chilled Microfuge tubes, 1 ml or 106 cell eq/tube, and each was made 25 μm in ATP by additions from a 5 mm stock solution. Other components of the reaction mixture were added as indicated, and the samples were rocked overnight (∼16 h) at 4 °C. Anti-HA ascites (3 μl each sample) was added, and the samples were rocked an additional 2 h at 4 °C prior to isolation of the immune complexes with protein A-Sepharose beads. These pellets were washed three times in actin lysis buffer for 10 min each at 4 °C, and the final pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and resolved by gel electrophoresis as described above. Co-immunoprecipitation of proteins specifically bound to the amino-terminally HA-tagged forms of Cdc42 was carried out in transfected COS-7 cells expressing wild-type (WT), dominant-negative (T17N) or constitutively active (Q61L) Cdc42, or vector alone. Biosynthetic labeling of cellular proteins in these transfected cells with [35S]methionine, followed by immunoprecipitation, revealed an intense band at 195 kDa in autoradiographed gels that co-precipitated with the constitutively active form of HA-Cdc42 (Fig.1 A). Low levels of p195 co-immunoprecipitated with the wild-type form of HA-Cdc42 whereas no association between p195 and HA-Cdc42T17N was detected even when the dominant-negative form of HA-Cdc42 was expressed at higher levels. The interaction between p195 and HA-Cdc42 was specific for HA-Cdc42, as HA-tagged Rho and Rac showed no detectable co-immunoprecipitation with p195 (data not shown). The [35S]methionine-labeled p195 protein was identified by Western blotting with an antibody specific for IQGAP1. Antibodies raised against the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of recombinant IQGAP1 both recognized immunoprecipitated p195 (data not shown). Previous work by us (4Hart M. Callow M. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 6McCallum S. Wu W. Cerione R. J. Biol.

A second co-immunoprecipitated protein of ∼17 kDa has been previously identified as Ca2+-calmodulin (4Hart M. Callow M. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The putative calmodulin binding domain in the IQGAP sequence (i.e. the IQ repeat motif) most likely accounts for the presence of calmodulin in immunoprecipitates of the epitope-tagged Cdc42. The association of calmodulin with immunoprecipitated IQGAP is not stoichiometric; however, it has recently been reported that calmodulin can influence IQGAP interactions with Cdc42 (19Joyal J.L.

Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). IQGAP and F-actin have previously been shown to co-localize in the peripheral cell cortex (4Hart M. Callow M. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and this co-localization has been suggested to be responsive to receptor tyrosine kinase pathways (7Kuroda S. Fukata M. Kobayashi K. Nakafuku M. Nomura N. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The result of EGF stimulation of serum-starved, transfected COS-7 cells is shown in Fig. 1 B. Co-immunoprecipitation of IQGAP with epitope-tagged Cdc42 increased after a 10-min stimulation of EGF. The time course for this increase mirrored that for EGF receptor phosphorylation (bottom of four panels; Fig.1 B). These results suggest that the EGF receptor kinase activity initiates a signaling pathway leading to the activation of the Cdc42 protein. The specificity and the relatively high affinity of GTP-bound Cdc42 for IQGAP suggested that these two proteins might co-localize in vivo. Fig. 2 A shows the immunostaining pattern obtained with anti-HA antibody (red) and antibody recognizing the endogenous IQGAP (green). Thetop two panels show that a diffuse distribution is observed for the dominant-negative form of HA3-Cdc42T17Nand that, in the HA3-Cdc42T17N transfected cells, a similarly diffuse distribution is observed for the endogenous IQGAP. In contrast, transfection of COS-7 cells with GTPase-defective HA3-Cdc42Q61L resulted in a significant overlap between HA-Cdc42 and IQGAP in the form of large pleats which included both proteins (bottom panels; Fig. 2 A). A significant percentage of cells expressing the HA-tagged wild-type Cdc42 also displayed the pleated structures (data not shown). This result is consistent with the view that Cdc42 acts upstream of IQGAP, perhaps by directing its incorporation into Cdc42-IQGAP complexes. We then examined whether F-actin was associated with these complexes. In cells staining positively for transfected, HA-tagged Cdc42WT and HA-Cdc42Q61L, we observed pleated structures that were shown to also contain F-actin, as these filaments stained with rhodamine phalloidin (14Wieland T. Phallotoxins. Springer-Verlag, New York1986: 69-88Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). In experiments using three different fluorescent dyes well resolved in their respective excitation and emission wavelengths, all three proteins, HA-Cdc42, IQGAP, and actin were seen to co-localize (data not shown), suggesting that they participate in the formation of a specialized, Cdc42-regulated structure. It has recently been reported that IQGAP purified from bovine adrenal binds to F-actin (20Bashour A. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We were interested in obtaining biochemical evidence for a Cdc42-IQGAP-F-actin complex. Lysates were prepared from cells transfected with wild-type HA-Cdc42, dominant-negative HA-Cdc42T17N, or constitutively active HA-Cdc42Q61L. The lysates were cleared of F-actin after centrifugation and then incubated with 25 μm phalloidin (a concentration that exceeds the remaining actin concentration as estimated by a comparison of immunoblotted actin standards (data not shown)). The stoichiometric addition of phalloidin to solutions of G-actin reduces the critical concentration for the G-actin to F-actin transition, resulting in a net increase in polymerized actin (8Estes J. Selden L. Gersham L. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 15Le Bihan T. Gicquaud C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Following overnight equilibration at 4 °C, immune complexes were isolated with anti-HA antibody, and the precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. We observed a co-immunoprecipitation of both IQGAP and actin with HA-Cdc42WT (lane 2, Fig.3 A), but not with either the dominant-negative HA-Cdc42T17N or constitutively active HA-Cdc42Q61L (lanes 4 and 6), when phalloidin was added to these lysates. No actin was detected in any of the samples without phalloidin addition (lanes 1,3, and 5 in Fig. 3 A). While the HA-Cdc42Q61L species remained capable of co-immunoprecipitating IQGAP (top panel, lane 5, Fig. 3 A), this was not observed for the phalloidin-treated sample (lane 6). Although the endogenous Cdc42 in transfected COS-7 lysates is about equimolar with the transfected HA-Cdc42Q61L, this last result suggests that endogenous wild-type Cdc42 participates more effectively than the transfected Cdc42Q61L in the formation of stable IQGAP-actin complexes in the presence of phalloidin, thereby depleting the endogenous IQGAP pool and rendering it unavailable for co-immunoprecipitation with Cdc42Q61L. One possible alternative explanation for these data may include IQGAP-F-actin guanine nucleotide exchange activity, which leads to the preferred incorporation and activation of wild-type Cdc42. We feel that it is unlikely that either F-actin or IQGAP alone is capable of guanine nucleotide exchange activity because we have not found F-actin to directly bind to Cdc42 nor have we detected exchange activity in purified preparations of IQGAP (data not shown). Nevertheless, the possibility that actin-IQGAP complexes in the phalloidin-treated lysates may serve as points of recruitment for other proteins including endogenous nucleotide exchange factors remains an intriguing possibility that warrants closer examination. Under the conditions of this experiment, the wild-type HA-tagged Cdc42 did not co-immunoprecipitate detectable IQGAP in the control lane (lane 1, Fig. 3 A). Only after the addition of the F-actin stabilizing compound, phalloidin, did the centrifuged lysate yield a complex containing HA-tagged (wild-type) Cdc42 together with IQGAP and actin. These results indicate that Cdc42 is part of a multimeric actin complex. In contrast, HA-Cdc42T17N was not capable of co-immunoprecipitating either IQGAP or actin under conditions where the F-actin pool was increased by the addition of phalloidin (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4), consistent with the findings from immunofluorescence experiments that HA-Cdc42T17N does not co-localize with F-actin or IQGAP. The requirement for wild-type Cdc42 suggests that the GTP hydrolytic activity and therefore the cycling of the GTPase between active and inactive states is necessary for the formation of a stable ternary complex, Cdc42-IQGAP-F-actin. Additional support for this view was obtained from studies with a stably transfected cell line expressing the wild-type HA-tagged Cdc42 construct. The transfected CHO cells provided a homogeneous cell population and led to better reproducibility in the actin polymerization experiments. After clearing these lysates of any F-actin by centrifugation, 1-ml aliquots of supernatant (1 × 106 cell eq) were tested for HA immunoprecipitation of actin complexes in response to a variety of treatments. The Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 3 B is consistent with a role for Cdc42-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis in the formation of Cdc42-IQGAP-actin complexes. Only when GTP was present in a lysate containing phalloidin was an appreciable amount of actin co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA (12CA5) antibody (lane 4, Fig. 3 B). Significantly, the co-immunoprecipitation of actin was blocked by the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, GTPγS, even while the amount of co-immunoprecipitated IQGAP in this sample remained comparable (lane 5, Fig. 3 B). Thus, under the conditions used in these immunoprecipitation experiments where the protein contents of the cell are diluted, added GTP can drive complex formation. The situation may not be so clear-cut in the intact cell where the relevant protein concentrations are ∼4 orders of magnitude higher. Immunolocalization of the constitutively active mutant of HA-Cdc42 in transfected cells, which binds tightly to IQGAP but is not observed to be a stable element of the actin complex in immunoprecipitation experiments, may not show the strict nucleotide dependence observed in the cell-free system. The reversible interaction of the HA-Cdc42-IQGAP complex with actin most likely occurs through the amino-terminal domain of IQGAP, which harbors a potential binding site for F-actin, similar to those found in α-actinin and filamin (9Castresana J. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 16Winder S.J. Hemmings L. Maciver S. Bolton S. Tinsley J. Davies K. Critchley D. Kendrick-Jones J. J.

One attractive hypothesis regarding the role of Cdc42 in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is the allosteric regulation of the availability of this site of actin-IQGAP interaction by the binding of activated Cdc42. Taken together, the in vitro results suggest a scheme (Fig.4) in which the formation of a ternary complex between GTP-bound Cdc42, IQGAP, and F-actin represents a transient state which precedes the formation of more stable Cdc42-IQGAP-actin aggregates. In this model, formation of F-actin by the addition of phalloidin in the lysates drives the initial formation of the actin-IQGAP-Cdc42 interaction while hydrolysis of GTP increases the stability of the complex such that it persists under the conditions of the immunoprecipitation experiment. This aspect of the model may explain our findings that HA-Cdc42Q61L and actin co-localize in transfected cells (Fig. 2 B) but are unable to form a stable ternary complex as detected by immunoprecipitation (Fig.3 A, lane 6). Based on our data demonstrating that only the wild-type form of Cdc42 is competent at driving the formation of these complexes in vitro, we propose that GTP hydrolysis by Cdc42 results in stably cross-linked actin filaments that are observed in our experiments as immunoprecipitable Cdc42-IQGAP-actin complexes. In this view, actin remodeling, as it pertains to Cdc42 activation, occurs as a consequence of GTP hydrolysis by Cdc42, allowing the wild-type Cdc42 protein to regulate the assembly of F-actin into stable higher order structures. Cdc42T17N, by competitively inhibiting the activation of endogenous Cdc42, would block both the formation of the transient Cdc42-IQGAP-actin ternary complex and the subsequent formation of a stable ternary complex. Conversely, although Cdc42Q61L binds tightly to IQGAP and co-localizes with IQGAP-actin structures, our model proposes that it is not tightly incorporated into the immunoprecipitable F-actin structures due to the requirement for Cdc42-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis. The apparent need for a GTPase-competent Cdc42 molecule for the assembly and regulation of higher order actin complexes is provocative given that we have found that expression of GTPase-defective forms of Cdc42 in NIH 3T3 cells, while being capable of binding target molecules and stimulating target kinase activities, is nonetheless deleterious to normal cell growth and cytokinesis. 2K. Shinjo, unpublished observations. Thus, the ability of Cdc42 to initiate a sequence of events that results in actin reorganization may underlie processes that are fundamentally important to cell viability. Current studies are focusing on identifying other cellular participants in these Cdc42/IQGAP-mediated actin rearrangements and in establishing how these remodeling events may affect other known Cdc42 cellular activities."

We investigated CD95-induced ceramide formation in Jurkat cells, using two methods (radiolabeling/thin layer chromatography and benzoylation/high performance liquid chromatography), which, unlike the commonly used diglyceride kinase assay, discriminate between ceramide species and de novoformed dihydroceramide. We demonstrate that ceramide accumulates after several hours, reaching a 7-fold increase after 8 h, kinetics closely paralleling apoptosis induction. No fast response was observed, not even in the presence of inhibitors of ceramide metabolism. The majority (∼70%) of the ceramide response remained unaffected when apoptosis was completely inhibited at the level of caspase-3/CPP32 processing by the inhibitor peptide DEVD-CHO. Exogenous cell-permeable C2-ceramide induced the proteolytic processing of caspase-3, albeit with somewhat slower kinetics than with CD95.

A second pathway leading to apoptosis involves activation of sphingomyelinase (SMase), which hydrolyzes sphingomyelin (SM) to ceramide (Cer).

A specific role for Cer in mediating apoptotic signals is suggested by the apoptotic effect of exogenous short-chain Cer, the structurally closely related compound dihydroCer being inactive. Likewise, treatment with bacterial SMase or drugs that inhibit metabolic conversion of Cer causes apoptosis, supposedly via elevated endogenous Cer levels (18Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). There is currently much confusion about the role of endogenous Cer in apoptosis, inasmuch as kinetics and magnitude of the Cer response differ widely among various studies (18Hannun Y.A.

Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One may question whether late ceramide formation is a consequence rather than a cause of apoptosis, inasmuch as kinetics often parallels the onset of apoptosis (19Tepper C.G. Jayadev S. Liu B.

On the other hand, overexpression of Bcl-2 in ALL-697 cells did not affect vincristine- or TNFα-induced delayed ceramide formation whereas it completely prevented apoptosis (22Zhang J. Alter N.

Activation of both SMase and caspases has been implicated in apoptosis, especially when induced by members of the TNF receptor family, but the connection between both pathways has not been elucidated. In the present study, we have thoroughly investigated CD95-induced Cer formation by two different quantitation methods, other than the commonly used Escherichia coli diglyceride kinase assay. Unlike the latter assay, the new assays based on metabolic radiolabeling/TLC and benzoylation/HPLC, respectively, allow the resolution of Cer with different chain lengths as well as separation from de novo synthesized dihydroCer. We demonstrate that, in Jurkat T cells, CD95 only induces late Cer formation paralleling caspase-3 activation. Direct inhibition of caspase-3 processing prevents apoptosis but does not block the Cer response. Because exogenous Cer can activate caspase-3, our findings suggest that Cer acts upstream of caspase-3 in the CD95-induced apoptotic signaling pathway.

Methods. 1984; 72: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), resuspended at 5–10 × 106 cells/ml in Yssel's medium in a 24-well culture plate, and stimulated with CH-11 mAb, C2-Cer (prepared as 10 mm stock in Me2SO), or SMase for various time periods at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For apoptosis measurements, cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml, 200 μl/well in round-bottomed, 96-well microtiter plates in Yssel's medium (24Yssel H. de Vries J.E. Koken M. van Blitterswijk W.J. Spits H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (25Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4398) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity of propidium iodide-stained DNA was determined in 5000 cells on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), and data were analyzed using Lysys software. Fragmented, apoptotic nuclei are recognized by their subdiploid DNA content. Cells (1 × 107) were collected by brief centrifugation and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:2,v/v) and phases separated (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41817) Google Scholar). Benzoate-derivatives were prepared essentially as has been reported for mono- and diglycerides (27Louie K. Wiegand R.D. Anderson R.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 9014-9020Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Dried lipid extracts of 1 × 107 cells were dissolved in 0.25 ml of toluene containing 8 mg of benzoic anhydride and 3 mg of 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine and allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 h. Under these conditions, no amide acylation occurs (28Gross S.K. McCluer R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Samples were cooled on ice, and 2 ml of 25% NH4OH was added dropwise. Benzoate-derivatives were extracted three times with 2 ml ofn-hexane. The samples were dried, reconstituted in 1 ml of chloroform, passed through a 0.2-μm HPLC sample filter, dried under N2, and dissolved in a small volume (usually 50 μl) of carbon tetrachloride. HPLC was performed using a Waters 600E System Controller. Separation of benzoylated lipids was accomplished using isocratic HPLC with a ChromSpher silica analytical column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5-μm pore size) based on published methods (29Iwamori M. Costello C. Moser H.W. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 20: 86-96Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 30Previati M. Bertolaso L. Tramarin M. Bertagnolo V. Capitani S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Samples of 15 μl, corresponding to lipids from 3 × 106 cells, were injected, and eluates were monitored at 230 nm using a Waters 486 Tunable Absorbance Detector. The attenuation was usually set at a full scale of 0.075 absorbance unit. Data were collected with a Waters 741 Data Module integrator. The mobile phase consisted of cyclohexane, 0.45% (v/v) isopropanol at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. This system not only allows the separation of benzoyl-Cer from other benzoylated lipid molecules, it also resolves dihydroCer and Cer molecular species differing in fatty acid chain length. Cells (1 × 106/ml) in Yssel's medium (24Yssel H. de Vries J.E. Koken M. van Blitterswijk W.J. Spits H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) were labeled with [14C]serine (0.2 μCi/ml) for 16–20 h. When inhibitors of Cer metabolism were used, these were added at this point. Cells were washed twice, stimulated, and extracted as described above. Lipid extracts were spotted on TLC silica plates and developed to 70% of the total length in CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/25% NH4OH (50/50/2/1, v/v). Plates were dried under nitrogen and rechromatographed to the top of the plate in CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/25% NH4OH (90/10/0.5/0.5, v/v). Under these conditions, Cer, glucosylceramide, sphingosine, SM, and glycerophospholipids are well separated. Radioactive lipids were visualized and quantitated using a Fujix BAS 2000 TR phosphorimager (exposure time 1–2 days). For chromatographic reference, radiolabeled Cer was prepared from endogenous [14C]SM isolated by TLC and sonicated in 1.5 ml of 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 6 mmMgCl2, by incubation overnight with B. cereusSMase (1 units/ml) at 37 °C. [14C]Cer, extracted with diethylether, yielded a doublet on TLC corresponding to Cer species containing either C22–24 (upper spot) or C16–18 (lower spot) fatty acid chains, as was confirmed with bovine brain Cer (mainly C24:1 and C18:0 species), C24:1-Cer, and C18:0-Cer as commercial standards (data not shown). Cells (2 × 106) were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 30 μl of 10 mm triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.8, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.02 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 0.02 mg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were centrifuged, and supernatants were taken up in reducing SDS sample buffer and separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (equivalents of 0.8–1 × 106 cells/lane). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel, Germany). Blots were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20; probed with purified anti-Ig (10 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% nonfat dry milk, followed by a 1:7500 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit Ig (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark); and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). Previous studies suggested the involvement of acidic SMase, generating Cer, in transmitting signals from the CD95 receptor to the apoptotic machinery (12Cifone M.G. De Maria R. Roncaioli P.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5859-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 19Tepper C.G. Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A. Wolff R. Yonehara S. Hannun Y. Seldin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8443-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). However, widely conflicting data regarding kinetics and magnitude of Cer formation have caused much confusion concerning the role of Cer as a mediator of apoptosis as induced by CD95 or other apoptotic stimuli (18Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to analyze Cer formation by methods alternative to the commonly used procedure for Cer mass measurement involving E. colidiglyceride kinase (31Wright T.M. Rangan L.A. Shin H.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9374-9380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major drawback of this assay is that it does not discriminate between Cer and dihydroCer (32Smith E.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18749-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which lacks the C4–C5 trans double bond in the sphingoid backbone and is, therefore, biologically inactive (33Bielawska A. Crane H.M. Liotta D. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26226-26232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the outstanding question whether Cer plays a role in apoptosis induction, we investigated the kinetics and magnitude of CD95-induced Cer formation in apoptosis-sensitive Jurkat T cells, using two different quantitation methods that discriminate between Cer, released from existing sphingolipids, and dihydroCer, produced via stimulated de novo synthesis. The first method involves metabolic sphingolipid labeling in the sphingoid backbone using [14C]serine and analysis of Cer formation by TLC. Besides a clear distinction between dihydroCer and Cer, this method allows separation of Cer species containing either long (C22–24) or intermediate (C16 -18) fatty acids represented by a doublet (Fig. 1 A). Exposure of Jurkat T cells to monoclonal anti-human CD95/Fas IgM (CH-11) caused accumulation of Cer, which was most prominent for the intermediate species (lower spot). Analysis of Cer species generated by bacterial SMase treatment of [14C]serine-labeled cells (data not shown) or total isolated endogenous [14C]SM (Fig.1 A) also yielded a doublet with the majority of the radioactivity also residing in the lower spot. Because the Cer species distribution produced upon CD95 stimulation reflects the fatty acid composition of total SM, there is no evidence for the selective hydrolysis of SM with intermediate acyl chains. Quantification of total Cer showed a first significant increase between 3 and 4 h after CD95 stimulation, which further increased to approximately 7-fold above basal at 8 h (Fig. 1 B). Although the accumulation of C16–18 species (referred to as Cer lower spot) may somewhat precede, there is a clear temporal correlation between total Cer formation and the onset of apoptosis measured by nuclear segmentation. Others have shown a similar correlation in SKW6.4 cells, when the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide viability assay (19Tepper C.G. Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A. Wolff R. Yonehara S. Hannun Y. Seldin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8443-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) or bisbenzamide staining (21Sillence D.J. Allan D. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were used to monitor kinetics of CD95-induced cell death. In separate experiments, using several assays (diglyceride kinase, [14C]serine labeling, or HPLC; see below), we have extensively looked for rapid (within 30 min) Cer responses, but these were never detected (data not shown). Alternatively, we metabolically labeled SM with [14C]choline (48 h). Subsequent CD95 triggering did not reveal an acute decrease in [14C]SM, which would be indicative of SMase activity (results not shown). We next considered the possibility that detection of an acute Cer signal could have been masked by its rapid attenuation through the action of ceramidase or glucosyltransferase. Cer degradation to sphingosine by neutral ceramidase is inhibited byd-e-MAPP (34Bielawska A. Greenberg M.S. Perry D. Jayadev S. Shayman J.A. McKay C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12646-12654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), whereas PPMP (35Abe A. Shayman J.A. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14383-14389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and tamoxifen (36Cabot M.C. Giuliano A.E. Volner A. Han T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 129-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) block conversion of Cer to glucosylceramide. Interestingly, these agents have been reported to be inducers of apoptosis, presumably via increasing endogenous Cer levels (18Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). After [14C]serine labeling of sphingolipids, cells were pretreated overnight with 500 nm PPMP or 10 μm tamoxifen, which indeed increased the steady-state ratio Cer/glucosylceramide (data not shown), or with 10 μmd-e-MAPP. Subsequent CD95 triggering in the presence of these agents, however, did not reveal any acute Cer formation, whereas all agents induced apoptosis at higher concentrations (results not shown). To exclude the possibility that [14C]serine might have selectively labeled a subpopulation of SM molecules inaccessible to possible rapid CD95-induced hydrolysis, we also developed an HPLC method to quantify Cer mass. In this assay, total cellular lipids were subjected to a derivatization procedure to yield chromophoric, nonpolar benzoate-derivatives. Exposure of Jurkat cells to anti-CD95 mAb caused Cer accumulation, which, again, was most prominent for the second peak of a doublet, corresponding to C16–18 Cer species (Fig.2). Also with this assay, kinetics of Cer formation closely paralleled apoptosis and no acute Cer formation was detected, in agreement with the radiolabeling assay. From these extensive analyses, we have to conclude that CD95 triggering does not evoke rapid activation of SMase, but only causes a late and sustained elevation of Cer species that predominantly contain intermediate chain fatty acids. The relevance of late Cer formation in mediating CD95-induced apoptosis is a topic of debate. In a number of studies, cell lines resistant to apoptosis induced by CD95 (19Tepper C.G. Jayadev S.

Immunol. 1995; 25: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were reported to lack Cer formation. However, whether this is really the cause, as was suggested, rather than a consequence of their resistance remains a question. In the case of TNFα-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, ceramide accumulation is also slow but clearly precedes apoptosis (23Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Activation of the ICE/Ced-3-like cysteine protease caspase-3/CPP32 was previously shown to be required for CD95-induced apoptosis (39Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. Miller D.K. Thornberry N.A. Yamin T.-T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1841-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows the kinetics of proteolytic activation of caspase-3 as triggered by CD95 in Jurkat cells. A first significant decline in the 32-kDa proform with concomitant appearance of a proteolytic fragment is observed after 4 h. The caspase inhibitor DEVD-CHO (40Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3766) Google Scholar) efficiently blocked caspase-3 processing (Fig.3) and apoptosis (Fig. 6). However, this inhibitor did not prevent CD95-induced Cer formation (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, Fig.4 B shows that inhibition of caspase-3 and apoptosis hardly affected the kinetics of Cer formation, although its magnitude is reduced by approximately 30%. These data suggest that CD95-induced ceramide formation occurs upstream of caspase-3 activation. In a different system, i.e. TNFα-stimulated MCF-7 cells, Dbaiboet al. (23Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K.

Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) also concluded that Cer was generated upstream of caspases involved in the “execution stage” of apoptosis, inasmuch as Bcl-2 overexpression did not interfere with TNFα-induced ceramide generation, while it provided protection from exogenous Cer-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and apoptosis (22Zhang J.

After a 2-h preincubation with DEVD-CHO at varying concentrations, Jurkat cells were exposed to anti-CD95 mAb (CH-11; 500 ng/ml; 8 h), C2-Cer (50 μm; 18 h), B. cereus SMase (300 milliunits/ml; 18 h), or control medium (18 h). Apoptosis was determined by FACS analysis (25Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol.

(41Gamen S. Marzo I. Anel A. Piñeiro A. Naval J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 233-237Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), wherein DEVD-CHO completely prevented CD95-induced Cer generation. However, they measured only [1-14C]stearic acid-labeled Cer at 16 h and showed no kinetics of Cer formation or apoptosis. Their 16-h timepoint might well reflect an end point of the apoptotic process (dead cells). Others, using the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk to inhibit CD95-induced cell death, observed complete inhibition of ceramide production in SKW 6.4 cells (21Sillence D.J. Allan D. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and concluded that Cer is formed as a consequence of processes downstream of the caspase cascade. However, because zVAD.fmk is a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor and can inhibit FLICE activation in vivo (8Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), their results do not exclude that Cer is formed in between steps of sequential caspase activation. As the majority of Cer accumulation is not downstream of caspase-3 and because kinetics parallel caspase-3 proteolytic processing, we investigated whether caspase-3 could be a Cer target. Indeed, exogenous C2-Cer induced the proteolytic cleavage of the 32-kDa proform of the protease after 6–8 h (Fig.5), which is somewhat later than by CD95 stimulation. Notably, in a different system, i.e.C6-Cer-treated Molt-4 cells, and using a different read-out, i.e. proteolytic cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, Smyth et al. (42Smyth M.J. Perry D.K. Zhang J. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have also found activation of caspase-3 by exogenous Cer. Fig.6 shows that nuclear fragmentation in response to exogenous Cer and bacterial SMase, like that induced by CD95, was inhibited by DEVD-CHO in a dose-dependent fashion. These results provide evidence for the specific requirement of caspase-3 in mediating the apoptotic effect of both short-chain Cer as well as of naturally occurring Cer species. Taken together, we find that CD95 evokes no rapid (<1 h) Cer response but only induces late Cer formation paralleling caspase-3 activation and the appearance of nuclear fragmentation. Direct inhibition of caspase-3 processing by the caspase inhibitor DEVD-CHO completely prevents the apoptotic phenotype but does not block the majority (∼70%) of the Cer response. These results indicate that late Cer is not a mere result of CD95-induced apoptosis but rather could be instrumental in the execution of apoptosis. Exogenous Cer was shown to induce caspase-3 processing, and, moreover, caspase-3 activation appeared a requirement for apoptosis induced either by cell-permeable Cer or bacterial SMase. Thus, our results support the model in which the SMase pathway acts upstream of the caspase-3 member of the family of caspases in CD95-induced apoptosis and pose intriguing questions concerning the role of Cer acting in concert with members of the proteolytic cascade. We thank E. Noteboom for his contribution to the FACS analyses and Dr. G. Gil-Gomez for kindly providing the polyclonal antiserum against human caspase-3/CPP32."
https://openalex.org/W2019096247,"PTPL1 is an intracellular protein-tyrosine phosphatase that contains five PDZ domains. Here, we present the cloning of a novel 150-kDa protein, the four most C-terminal amino acid residues of which specifically interact with the fourth PDZ domain of PTPL1. The molecule contains a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain, a cysteine-rich, putative Zn2+- and diacylglycerol-binding domain, and a region of sequence homology to the product of the Caenorhabditis elegans geneZK669.1a. The GAP domain is active on Rho, Rac, and Cdc42in vitro but with a clear preference for Rho; we refer to the molecule as PTPL1-associated RhoGAP 1, PARG1. Rho is inactivated by GAPs, and protein-tyrosine phosphorylation has been implicated in Rho signaling. Therefore, a complex between PTPL1 and PARG1 may function as a powerful negative regulator of Rho signaling, acting both on Rho itself and on tyrosine phosphorylated components in the Rho signal transduction pathway."

It was shown subsequently that this enzyme forms the 8S enantiomer (9Hughes M.A. Brash A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1081: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and isolation of the corresponding hydroperoxide confirmed identification of the enzyme as a lipoxygenase (10Fürstenberger G. Hagedorn H. Jacobi T. Besemfelder E. Stephan M. Lehmann W.D. Marks F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15738-15745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse skin is the only reported site of synthesis of 8S-HETE in animal tissues, and there is no indication from the literature pointing to a potential homologue of the mouse 8S-lipoxygenase in other mammals.In the course of studies on HETE synthesis in skin, we recently cloned a second type of 15S-lipoxygenase from human skin (11Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This enzyme is different from the well known reticulocyte type of 15S-lipoxygenase in that it oxygenates arachidonic acid purely at C-15 and linoleic acid is a relatively poor substrate. For clarity, we will refer to the reticulocyte-type of 15S-lipoxygenase as 15-Lox-1 and the more recently cloned enzyme as 15-Lox-2. It was not clear a priori what is the animal homologue of the new human lipoxygenase, 15-Lox-2. In searching for a potential murine homologue, we carried out a series of PCR reactions using mouse skin. This led to the detection of a new mouse cDNA that is characterized in this report.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Mouse Epidermal Total RNA and cDNA SynthesisPhorbol ester (PMA, 10 nmol) dissolved in 50 μl of acetone was applied topically onto dorsal skin of 6–7-day-old mice. At 21–24 h after PMA treatment, the mice were euthanized, and epidermis was prepared from the frozen dorsal skin as described previously (9Hughes M.A. Brash A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1081: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The frozen epidermis was dropped into guanidinium thiocyanate solution, the lysis buffer from the RNeasy RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN). After a brief sonication using an ultrasonic probe (2 s, twice), total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer instructions. Approximately 50 μg of total RNA was recovered in 50 μl of water. Twenty μl aliquots were used in 50 μl reactions for first strand cDNA synthesis using an oligo(dT)-adaptor primer (12Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Shieh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20949-20957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). One μl aliquots of cDNA were used directly in PCR reactions.PCR Cloning of Epidermal Lipoxygenase cDNAInitial PCR CloneTwo upstream degenerate primers encoded the sequence DVWLLAK. The two primers differed only in using alternative codons for the 3′-lysine, AAA or AAG, and they are referred to below as WLLAK-(AAA) and WLLAK-(AAG) (11Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). For the first round PCR reaction, each upstream primer was used in separate reactions against a set of downstream primers encoding three amino acid sequences beginning GQ that occur seven amino acids downstream of the most 3′-histidine ligand to the iron: the sequence GQLDW occurs in mammalian 12S- and 15S-lipoxygenases, GQYDW occurs in 5S-lipoxygenases, and GQFDS occurs in the new human 15S-lipoxygenase, 15-Lox-2 (11Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The primer sequences were reported previously (11Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), except for the new degenerate downstream primer encoding GQFDS: 5′-CCA-AGC-GCA-SSA-RTC-RAA-YTG-NCC (where S, “strong,” encodes C or G). For the second round nested PCR reaction, the upstream primer was retained as before (WLLAK-(AAA) or WLLAK-(AAG)) while the downstream primer was changed in all reactions to encode the sequence ELQXWWR (11Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). After the second round PCR, only the reaction that originally used the WLLAK-(AAG) and GQFDS primers yielded a visible PCR product. This product was 500 bp in size. The first round PCR reaction was primed with cDNA from phorbol ester-treated mouse epidermis, 1 μl per 50-μl PCR reaction (from a 50-μl cDNA synthesis using 20 μg total RNA), and using 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2 with 0.2 mm of each dNTP and 0.25 μl (1.25 units) of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) in a Perkin-Elmer 480 thermocycler. After the addition of the cDNA at 80 °C (hot start), the PCR was programmed as follows: 94 °C for 2 min, 1 cycle; 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, 94 °C for 1 min, 30 cycles; 72 °C for 10 min, 1 cycle; and then the block temperature was held at 4 °C. The second round reaction was primed with the equivalent of 0.1 μl of the first round reaction products (added as a 10-fold dilution). The protocol was 94 °C for 2 min for 1 cycle and 58 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and 94 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles, and the protocol was completed with 1 cycle at 72 °C for 10 min and then the block temperature was held at 4 °C.3′-RACE and 5′-RACEThe 3′-sequence was obtained using established upstream sequence 5′-G-AGC-TTT-GTC-TCT-GAA-ATA-GTC-AG-3′ against a downstream primer based on the adaptor-linked oligo(dT) primer used for cDNA synthesis (12Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Shieh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20949-20957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The 5′-RACE was accomplished using a kit from Life Technologies, Inc. according to the manufacturer instructions. The gene-specific downstream primers were 5′-GTG-AGG-AAT-CAA-TAG-CTT-GAA-GAG-3′, and 5′-G-ATG-TGT-GAC-AGC-CTC-ATG-GAT-G-3′.Full-length Clones Obtained by PCRThe upstream primer encoded the N terminus with a HindIII site added at the 5′-end to facilitate subcloning, 5′-C-AAG-CTT-AGG-AGG-ATG-GCG-AAA-TGC-AGG-3′, and the downstream primer encoded the C terminus of the protein with an added 5′EcoRI site, 5′G-GAA-TTC-ATG-TTA-GAT-GGA-GACACT-GTT-3′. These two primers were purified by HPLC as the DMT (dimethoxytrityl) derivative (12Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Shieh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20949-20957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). After deprotection, they were used in PCR reactions with a proof-reading mixture of Taq/Pwo DNA polymerase (Expand High Fidelity, Boehringer-Mannheim) according to the manufacturer instructions. The reaction conditions were 94 °C, 2 min for 1 cycle; 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1.5 min, and 96 °C for 15 s for 3 cycles; 68 °C for 2 min, and 96 °C for 15 s for 30 cycles; 72 °C for 10 min for 1 cycle; and the block temperature was held at 4 °C.DNA SequencingcDNAs were sequenced using the Oncor Fidelity manual dideoxy chain termination method or by automated sequencing on an ABI Prism 310 Genetic analyzer and fluorescence-tagged dye terminator cycle sequencing (Perkin-Elmer).HPLC Analysis of Lipoxygenase MetabolismThe lipoxygenase metabolism of [1-14C]arachidonic acid or [1-14C] linoleic acid was evaluated essentially as described previously (9Hughes M.A. Brash A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1081: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Following incubation with 100 μm substrate, products were extracted using the Bligh and Dyer procedure (13Bligh G.H. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar), and the extracts were analyzed by reversed phase-HPLC, normal phase-HPLC, and chiral column analysis (11Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 14Brash A.R. Hawkins D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The hydroperoxide products were reduced with triphenylphosphine, methylated with diazomethane, purified by normal phase-HPLC, and then the stereochemistry was analyzed using a Chiralcel OD column.Expression of Mouse 8S-Lipoxygenase ClonesThe PCR products corresponding to the open reading frame of the cDNA were ligated directly into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) and expressed by transient transfection in HeLa cells using VTF-7, a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the T7 RNA polymerase gene (15Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), or in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells using the adenovirus viral-associated RNA gene (7Funk C.D. Keeney D.S. Oliw E.H. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23338-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the former system, cells plated at 1 × 106 cells/35-mm well 48 h earlier were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 3 μg of Lipofectin and harvested after 12 h. In the HEK system, cells plated at 1 × 106cells/10-cm dish 24 h earlier were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate method and harvested after 2–3 days (7Funk C.D. Keeney D.S. Oliw E.H. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23338-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The harvested cells were sonicated on ice, and the resulting homogenates were incubated with 100 μm[1-14C]arachidonic acid or [1-14C]linoleic acid for 45 min at room temperature. The metabolites were extracted and analyzed as described above.Screening of cDNA LibraryThe library was a commercial λ Unizap.XR skin cDNA library prepared using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from whole skin of C57/black female mice (Stratagene). It was screened with a 347-bpBsaMI fragment of the mouse 8S-lipoxygenase cDNA (PCR clone) as probe.Northern AnalysisPoly(A)+ RNA was prepared from PMA- or acetone-treated frozen dorsal skin using Tri Reagent®(Molecular Research Center, Inc.) and OligotexTM (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer instructions. The poly(A)+RNA was electrophoresed in 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and blotted to a Hybond-H+ nylon membrane (Amersham Corp.). The membrane was hybridized with 32P-labeled DNA probe (complementary with a 0.6-kilobase EcoRV/BamHI fragment of mouse epidermal 8S-lipoxygenase) prepared using the Multiprime DNA labeling kit (Amersham Corp.) and Rapid-hybridization buffer (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) and then washed according to the manufacturer specifications. Blots were exposed to Fuji x-ray film at −80 °C. Mouse cyclophilin cDNA was used as a house-keeping gene to access loading of RNA.Western AnalysisAfter quantitation by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred electrophoretically to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Corp.). These were probed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the human 15-Lox-2. This antibody recognizes 15-Lox-2 and the mouse 8S-lipoxygenase, but not the human reticulocyte type of 15S-lipoxygenase (see “Results”). Donkey anti-rabbit Ig linked with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) was the secondary antibody. Specifically bound protein was detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Life Science, Inc.).Immunohistochemical AnalysisThe dorsal and tail skin of 6–7-day-old mice were treated with acetone or PMA (10 nmol for dorsal skin, 2 nmol for tail skin). After 24 h, the animals were euthanized, and the dorsal and tail skin were washed with soap and then rinsed thoroughly with water. Whole dorsal and tail skin was immersion-fixed for 24 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), dehydrated in ethanolic solutions and xylenes, and embedded in paraffin. Skin sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated in graded alcohols. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked in 3% hydrogen peroxide/methanol for 20 min followed by incubation in 10% goat serum for 20 min. Sections were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in a 1/2500 dilution either of primary rabbit antisera that was used for Western analyses of 8S-lipoxygenase or of pre-immune sera. After rinsing in PBS, sections were incubated with the biotinylated secondary antisera and peroxidase-labeled tertiary antisera supplied with an ABC Elite kit (Vector Corp., Burlingame, CA) followed by visualization of immunoprecipitate with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine chromagen (Biogenix, Ban Ramon, CA).DISCUSSIONMouse 8S-lipoxygenase cDNA was cloned by PCR using primers related to a recently characterized human 15S-lipoxygenase (15-Lox-2) (11Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). These two lipoxygenases have 78% amino acid identity, and the differences are mainly conservative substitutions. The two enzymes have only 30–45% identity to other mammalian lipoxygenases. The primary structure of the mouse 8S-lipoxygenase contains the absolutely conserved iron-binding histidines of lipoxygenases and the C-terminal isoleucine that is also an iron ligand (19Boyington J.C. Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 20Minor W. Steczko J. Stec B. Otwinowski Z. Bolin J.T. Walter R. Axelrod B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10687-10701Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). A notable feature of the mouse 8S-lipoxygenase primary structure is the presence of a serine at amino acid position 558 as the putative 5th iron ligand (20Minor W. Steczko J. Stec B. Otwinowski Z. Bolin J.T. Walter R. Axelrod B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10687-10701Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The equivalent residue in all other lipoxygenases is either a histidine or asparagine, with the exception of the human 15-Lox-2 in which a serine is also present (11Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Based on the sequence similarity, our conclusion is that the 8S-lipoxygenase is the mouse homologue of the human 15-Lox-2. The extent to which the two enzymes are functionally homologous remains to be determined.Initially we had difficulty studying the mouse enzyme as we could not obtain reliable expression of active lipoxygenase using our conventional HEK cell system (1Chen X-S. Naumann T.A. Kurre U. Jenkins N.A. Copelend N.G. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17993-17999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 4Chen X-S. Kurre U. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13979-13987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The problem was solved by use of the recombinant vaccinia virus in a co-transfection system in Hela cells. In this procedure, the cells are co-transfected with the plasmid cDNA and vaccinia virus encoding the T7 RNA polymerase. The virus protein induces high level expression via the T7 promoter upstream of the lipoxygenase cDNA. The cells are harvested after 12 h. In this system, the mouse enzyme expressed with equivalent activity to either the 15-Lox-1 or 15-Lox-2 positive controls. Each of these lipoxygenases was expressed at a much higher level in the viral infected Hela cells than in the other procedure using the HEK cells.Our Western results show clearly that HEK cells produce the 8S-lipoxygenase protein although at lower levels than the positive controls (Fig. 3 C). Whether this is a transfection problem, or related to translation or protein stability is not resolved. We found a similar poor expression of activity of the mouse epidermal-type of 12S-lipoxygenase in HEK cells (7Funk C.D. Keeney D.S. Oliw E.H. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23338-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The lipoxygenase proteins expressed in HEK and HeLa cells were indistinguishable in size by Western analysis. The very same preparations of 8S-lipoxygenase plasmid cDNAs that failed to express active 8S-lipoxygenase in HEK cells were expressed with good activity in the vaccinia system. Changing the vector from pCR3.1 to pcDNA3 had no effect on HEK cell expression. Extracts of Hela cells (± viral infection or vector alone) did not restore catalytic activity to HEK cells transfected with 8S-lipoxygenase. Furthermore, changing the vaccinia virus system over to HEK cells failed to induce expression of 8S-lipoxygenase, whereas a 15-Lox-2 positive control gave easily measurable 15S-lipoxygenase activity. HEK cells may lack some factor that helps the effective expression of certain lipoxygenase enzymes.Linoleic acid was converted with about 3-fold lower efficiency than arachidonic acid by the 8S-lipoxygenase. It was, however, specifically oxygenated to 9S-HPODE and might participate in the biosynthesis of this product in vivo. Linoleic acid is an abundant polyunsaturated fatty acid in mouse skin, and thus, potentially, this substrate is available (21Ziboh V.A. Chapkin R.S. Prog. Lipid Res. 1988; 27: 81-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Lehmann et al. (22Lehmann W.D. Stephan M. Fürstenberger G. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) noted that the levels of 8-HETE and 9-HODE in mouse skin tend to change in parallel. Both are strikingly elevated in mouse skin papillomas and are lower than normal in skin carcinomas. The 9S chirality of the product from linoleic acid is one criterion that could be used to assess the contribution of the 8S-lipoxygenase to formation of 9-HODE in mouse skin. The main cyclooxygenase product from linoleic acid is the enantiomeric 9R-HODE (23Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 617: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), while non-enzymatic reactions would give racemic product.Northern and Western analyses, as well as the activity assay, showed that PMA treatment strongly induced de novo synthesis of mouse 8S-lipoxygenase in the dorsal skin of the outbred mice used in this experiment. The histochemical analyses further defined the effect of PMA. Immunoreactive 8S-lipoxygenase protein was most prominent in a layer of differentiated epidermis, the stratum granulosum. The thickness of this cell layer increased markedly following 24 h of treatment with PMA. An increase in the number of cells that produce 8S-lipoxygenase, therefore, is one of the causes of the increased 8S-lipoxygenase activity induced by PMA.In the Northern analysis using a multiple tissue blot, 8S-lipoxygenase mRNA was detected clearly in brain but not in the other seven tissues examined. Both the stratum granulosum of the epidermis and the neuronal tissues of the central nervous system were originally derived from the same ectodermal layer in early embryonic development, and both represent highly differentiated cell types. Occurrence of the 8S-lipoxygenase transcript in brain was unexpected as lipoxygenase-catalyzed formation of 8-HETE has not been reported in neuronal tissues. The negative reaction in liver is of interest in relation to the reported activity of 8S-HETE as a strong activator of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, PPAR-α (24Yu K. Bayona W. Kallen C.B. Harding H.P. Ravera C.P. McMahon G. Brown M. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23975-23983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In liver, there is the possibility of synthesis of 8-HETE via the microsomal cytochrome P-450 system, although in vitro this gives a nearly racemic 8-HETE product (25Capdevila J. Yadagiri P. Manna S. Falck J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The absence of 8S-lipoxygenase signal in the Northern analysis of liver, could, however, be related to the lack of induction in normal tissue. The same issue applies to the absence of detectable 8S-lipoxygenase activity in normal mouse prostate from young adult males (see “Results,” last section). Although the human homologue of the mouse 8S-lipoxygenase, 15-Lox-2, was readily detectible in human prostate (11Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), the pooled human sample would include tissue from older subjects, the majority of which are expected to exhibit benign prostatic hyperplasia (26Oesterling J.E. Prostate. 1996; 6: 67-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of 8S-lipoxygenase in mouse skin by phorbol ester certainly is a striking feature of this enzyme. It remains to be seen whether inducibility is a general characteristic of this mouse enzyme and its human homologue, 15-Lox-2. At least five distinct lipoxygenase enzymes are expressed in the mouse. Three of these enzymes are best known for their occurrence in different types of blood cells. In common with other mammals, a 5S-lipoxygenase is present in leukocytes and is responsible for synthesis of the pro-inflammatory mediators, the leukotrienes (1Chen X-S. Naumann T.A. Kurre U.

Nature. 1994; 372: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). A 12S-lipoxygenase is found in platelets and several other tissues including skin (3Nugteren D.H. Kivits G.A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4Chen X-S. Kurre U. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Funk C.D. J. Biol.

A second type of 12S-lipoxygenase, which is closely related in sequence to the human and rabbit “reticulocyte-type” of 15S-lipoxygenases, occurs in certain macrophages (5Sun D. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24055-24062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The fourth mouse lipoxygenase to be characterized is another enzyme to have 12S-lipoxygenase activity; it was cloned recently from mouse skin and has been classified as an epidermal 12S-lipoxygenase (6van Dijk K.W.

https://openalex.org/W2059737467,"The vacuole constitutes a large compartment in plant and fungal cells. The VAM3 gene ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a syntaxin-related protein required for vacuolar assembly. An Arabidopsis thalianacDNA library, designed for expression in S. cerevisiae,was screened for cDNAs able to complement defective vacuolar assembly of the Δvam3 mutation. One cDNA, encoding a 33-kDa protein with structural similarities to the other syntaxins, was identified. The product of AtVAM3 (AtVam3p) was expressed in various tissues including roots, leaves, inflorescence stems, flower buds, and young siliques. The AtVAM3 transcripts were abundant in undifferentiated cells in the meristematic region. AtVam3p fractionated predominantly to an 8,000 × g pellet fraction where a vacuolar membrane protein H+-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase) also fractionated. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that AtVam3p was localized to restricted regions on the vacuolar membranes. We propose that AtVam3p provides the t-SNARE function in the vacuolar assembly in A. thaliana. The vacuole constitutes a large compartment in plant and fungal cells. The VAM3 gene ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a syntaxin-related protein required for vacuolar assembly. An Arabidopsis thalianacDNA library, designed for expression in S. cerevisiae,was screened for cDNAs able to complement defective vacuolar assembly of the Δvam3 mutation. One cDNA, encoding a 33-kDa protein with structural similarities to the other syntaxins, was identified. The product of AtVAM3 (AtVam3p) was expressed in various tissues including roots, leaves, inflorescence stems, flower buds, and young siliques. The AtVAM3 transcripts were abundant in undifferentiated cells in the meristematic region.

We propose that AtVam3p provides the t-SNARE function in the vacuolar assembly in A. thaliana. The vacuole in plant and fungal cells constitutes a large compartment with various physiological functions (1Matile P. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1978; 29: 193-213Crossref Google Scholar, 2Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The vacuole serves as a storage compartment for various primary and secondary metabolites including amino acids, organic acids, and sugars. It is a lytic compartment as well, sharing common features with lysosomes of mammalian cells. It also functions in homeostatic regulation of cytosolic ions by transporting small molecules across the vacuolar membrane through various transporters. One of the most prominent features of the plant vacuole is its large volume. In fully matured plant cells, it occupies over 90% of cell volume. Individual plants need to expand their stems, leaves, and roots to acquire resources from the environment including light energy, minerals, and water. This expansion in plant body size, however, would be costly if it were accomplished by cell division or by synthesis of cytosolic material. In fact, cell enlargement is mostly attributable to the increase in vacuolar volume. Therefore, the plant vacuole provides a space-filling compartment (3Maeshima M. Nakanishi Y. Matsuura-Endo C. Tanaka Y. J. Plant Res. 1996; 109: 119-125Crossref Google Scholar). While the physiological importance of the plant vacuole is clear and many of the molecules that make up this compartment have been well characterized, the molecular mechanisms involved in its assembly are largely unknown. In contrast, vacuolar biogenesis and assembly in the unicellular organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae are fairly well understood. Our previous genetic studies showed that nineVAM genes (for vacuolar morphology) are involved in the assembly of yeast vacuolar compartments (4Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18665-18670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also shown that the yeast VAM3 gene encodes a member of the syntaxin family (5Wada Y. Nakamura N. Ohsumi Y. Hirata A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the key molecules regulating vesicular transport (6Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S.

Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Syntaxins are membrane receptors on the target membrane (t-SNARE) that interact with the other molecules on the transport vesicles (v-SNARE). Specific interactions between the t-SNARE and v-SNARE molecules ensure fusion of the transport vesicles with their target membranes and the correct delivery of their contents (8Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The yeast vam3 mutants show a characteristic phenotype; they accumulate numerous small vesicles instead of large vacuoles, and they are defective in the processing of vacuolar membrane and soluble proteins. We have also shown that the product of VAM3(Vam3p) is localized to the yeast vacuolar membranes (5Wada Y. Nakamura N. Ohsumi Y. Hirata A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These structural and functional features of Vam3p are consistent with Vam3p providing the t-SNARE function in the vacuolar assembly in yeast cells. Vam3p is the first t-SNARE identified on the vacuole/lysosome in eukaryotic organisms. Toward understanding the development of vacuolar compartments in higher plant cells, in the present paper we searched for the vacuolar syntaxin of Arabidopsis thaliana. We predicted that vacuolar assembly in yeast and plant cells may share similar molecular machinery. If so, plant molecules may replace the function of corresponding yeast molecules, as shown in a handful of cases in different stages of intracellular vesicular trafficking (9d'Enfert C. Gensse M. Gaillardin C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4205-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Lee H.I. Gal S. Newman T.C. Raikhel N.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we report on the identification and characterization of a new member of syntaxin-related molecule, AtVam3p, the vacuolar t-SNARE of A. thaliana. Yeast vam3 strain YW22–12B has been described previously (5Wada Y. Nakamura N. Ohsumi Y. Hirata A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PEP12 gene of S. cerevisiae (13Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) was obtained by PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; mCPY, mature CPY; GST, glutathione S-transferase; H+-PPase, vacuolar proton translocating pyrophosphatase; LSP, low speed pellet; HSP, high speed pellet; HSS, high speed supernatant. amplification. A genomic DNA fragment containing PEP12 was screened for a yeast genomic library and subcloned into pBluescript II SK+(Stratagene). A pep12::LEU2 fragment was constructed by replacing the SplI/PstI region of PEP12 with the PvuII-PstI fragment of pJJ282 (14Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) containing LEU2 and was used for disruption of the chromosomal PEP12 gene by the standard method (15Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Yeast cells were cultured in SCD or SCGS supplemented appropriately (16Nakamura N. Hirata A. Ohsumi Y. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11344-11349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Kawai E. Ohsumi M. Protoplasma. 1996; 191: 126-135Crossref Google Scholar). The A. thaliana cDNA library in λYES (18Elledge S.J. Mulligan J.T. Ramer S.W. Spottswood M. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1731-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), originally constructed by R. W. Davis of Stanford University, was provided from Y. Komeda of Hokkaido University. The library was introduced into the yeast Δvam3 strain by the modified lithium acetate method (19Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Ura+ transformants were selected on SCGS (−Ura) containing 10 μg/ml adenine. Candidates for Vam+ colonies were identified by strong red pigmentation on the plates and subsequently verified by fluorescence microscopy for adepigment (5Wada Y. Nakamura N. Ohsumi Y. Hirata A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nakamura N. Hirata A. Ohsumi Y. Wada Y. J. Biol.

Plasmid was recovered and the cDNA insert was introduced into pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene) and sequenced on both strands. The coding region of the AtVAM3cDNA was amplified by PCR, verified by sequencing, and placed under the control of the TDH3 promoter in a plasmid pKT10 (2 μmURA3) (22Tanaka K. Nakafuku M. Tamanoi F. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4303-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was designated pKT10-AtVAM3. Genomic DNA blot was hybridized with the 32P-labeled, randomly primed full-length AtVAM3 cDNA fragment in a hybridization solution containing 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 60 °C overnight. The membrane was then washed once with 2 × SSC and 0.5% SDS at room temperature for 30 min, and twice with 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 15 min. The 3′-untranslated region of AtVAM3 was amplified by PCR using a pair of oligonucleotides, SAT1-NCRA (5′- AATGAGCTCATAGTACTCGCAGCT-3′) and SAT1-NCRS (5′-AATGGTACCCCACAAACAAAACAGAGTTTCTGT-3′), and subcloned into pBluescript II SK+ to generate plasmid pMHS005. Total RNA was isolated by RNeasy Plant Total RNA Kit (QIAGEN). Thirty μg of RNA was electrophoresed and transferred onto a nylon membrane and then hybridized with 32P-labeled RNA probes produced from plasmid pMHS005. The blot was washed in the same way as the DNA blot. Seedlings (7 days old) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, overnight at 4 °C, dehydrated through a graded ethanol series followed by a xylene series, and embedded in Paraplast Plus (Sherwood Medical). Microtome sections (4 μm) were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated through a graded ethanol series and then hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes prepared from the full-length cDNA of AtVAM3 by T3 or T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (23Kouchi H. Hata S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 238: 106-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment encoding a part of AtVam3p (Arg30-Lys200) was introduced into pGEX5X-1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and a GST-AtVam3p fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coli NM522. The fusion protein was purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Pharmacia) and used for immunizing a rabbit. Arabidopsis tissues were frozen in liquid N2, mixed with 1 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and homogenized in Eppendorf tubes with disposable pellet pestles (Kontes). The lysates were boiled and centrifuged to remove debris. Preparation of yeast cell lysates and immunoblotting analyses were described previously (16Nakamura N. Hirata A. Ohsumi Y. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11344-11349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Kawai E. Ohsumi M.

A. thaliana was grown in liquid medium (0.5 × Murashige and Skoog salts and vitamins (Gibco), 2% sucrose) at 20 to 25 °C under 16 h light/8 h dark condition for 3 weeks. Roots were excised, frozen in liquid N2, and then ground to fine powder. The powder was resuspended in AT extraction buffer (0.1m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 tablet of complete proteinase inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim) per 50 ml of buffer) and then centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min to remove debris and unbroken materials. The cell lysates were spun at 8,000 × g for 15 min to give a pellet fraction (low speed pellet (LSP)) and then the supernatant was further spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h to give pellet (high speed pellet (HSP)) and supernatant (high speed supernatant (HSS)) fractions. The apical shoot meristem of 1-week old A. thaliana was fixed for 2 h with a fixative that consisted of 4% paraformaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde, and 0.06 m sucrose in 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4. After washing with 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, that contained 0.06 m sucrose, the specimen was dehydrated in a graded series of dimethylformamide at −20 °C and embedded in LR-White resin (London Resin Co. Ltd., UK). ImmunoGold procedures were essentially the same as those described earlier (25Nishimura M. Takeuchi Y. De Bellis L. Hara-Nishimura I. Protoplasma. 1993; 175: 131-137Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar), except for the use of antiserum against GST-AtVam3p (diluted 50-fold) and 30-fold diluted protein A-gold (15 nm; Amersham Corp.). The sections were examined with a transmission microscope (model 1200EX; JEOL). Yeastvam3 mutants lack normal large vacuoles but accumulate small vacuole-related structures. This Vam phenotype is clearly seen even on plates by colony pigmentation of ade fluorochrome (4Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18665-18670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This pigment is produced in the ade1 and/or ade2mutants and accumulates in vacuoles (26Weisman L.S. Bacallao R. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Vam+ ade2 cells develop red colonies while vam3 ade2 mutants form less pigmented pink colonies, presumably due to the abnormal vacuolar morphology and reduced vacuolar volumes in the vam3mutant cells. To obtain the VAM3-related genes from A. thaliana, we screened cDNAs that were able to complement the defective vacuolar morphology of the vam3 mutant. We obtained 49 red candidates among 1 × 105transformants and observed them under a microscope to verify vacuolar morphology. Among them, we found one clone that developed large prominent vacuoles (Fig. 1). The plasmid was isolated from this Vam+ transformant, and it was reintroduced into the Δvam3 cells to confirm that the complementing activity was linked to the plasmid. The library expresses the cDNAs under the regulation of the yeast GAL1promoter that is highly induced in the presence of galactose as a carbon source. The transformants never developed large vacuoles in the glucose medium (Fig. 1 A) where the expression from theGAL1 promoter was repressed. In contrast, their vacuoles acquired normal morphology in the presence of galactose (Fig.1 B). We determined the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA and found an open reading frame encoding a 29.5-kDa polypeptide of 268 amino acid residues (Fig. 2 A). The size of the isolated cDNA (1183 base pairs) agreed well with the size of its RNA transcript (1.2-kilobase, Fig. 5 B), thus we concluded that this cDNA represents the full-length transcript. The amino acid sequence shows structural similarities to the members of syntaxin, including yeast Vam3p (Fig. 3). We designated this Arabidopsis gene, AtVAM3, from its structural similarity and functional potential for complementing the yeast vam3 mutation. The product, AtVam3p, has a heptad repeat structure (residues 164–220) in which hydrophobic amino acid residues appear at seven amino acid intervals. Such regions have a high potential to form an amphiphilic α-helix, intriguing for the intermolecular interactions by forming coiled-coil structure. AtVam3p has a highly hydrophobic segment at its C terminus thus implicating it to be a membrane protein while the rest of the sequence is hydrophilic, and there is no typical signal sequence for membrane insertion at the N terminus (Fig. 2 B). The other members of the syntaxin-related proteins such as Pep12p (13Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), aPep12p (27Bassham D.C. Gal S. da Silva Conceição A. Raikhel N.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), Sed5p (31Hardwick K.G. Pelham H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and Vam3p (5Wada Y. Nakamura N. Ohsumi Y. Hirata A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) share similar structural characteristics. They are hydrophilic proteins with 280–330 amino acid residues, and they possess single hydrophobic transmembrane domains at the C terminus but lack the typical signal sequences for membrane translocation at the N terminus. The amino acid sequence of AtVam3p was aligned to the syntaxin-related molecules (Fig. 3). AtVam3p shares 27.2 and 21.6% identity to Pep12p and Vam3p over entire length, respectively. Interestingly, AtVam3p failed to replace the Pep12p function in yeast cells (see below) although the structural similarity predicts that AtVam3p may relate more closely to yeast Pep12p than to Vam3p.Figure 5DNA and RNA gel blot analyses.

Pep12p and Vam3p are both syntaxin-related molecules and involved in the vacuolar biogenesis; however, these two proteins provide the t-SNARE function at different stages of yeast vacuolar assembly. Pep12p is shown to be localized on the prevacuolar/endosomal compartments (13Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), whereas Vam3p is found in the vacuolar membranes (5Wada Y. Nakamura N. Ohsumi Y. Hirata A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of their function results in distinctive phenotypes. Δpep12 cells exhibit mostly single large vacuoles, a characteristic phenotype of the class Dvps mutant group (32Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) to whichpep12/vps6 belongs, while Δvam3cells accumulate multiple small fragmented vacuoles. Δpep12 cells have severe defects in delivery of a set of vacuolar proteins including carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) to the vacuole. The pep12 mutants mistarget a considerable amount of newly synthesized CPY to the cell surface, thus Δpep12 cells contain essentially no mature CPY (13Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In contrast, Δvam3cells do not secrete CPY, though processing of CPY is less efficient in Δvam3 than in the wild-type cells. Therefore, Δvam3 cells contain both a mature form CPY as well as abnormally processed CPY (5Wada Y. Nakamura N. Ohsumi Y. Hirata A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the vacuolar morphology of yeast Δpep12cells did not change upon introduction of the AtVAM3 gene (data not shown), indicating that the AtVAM3 could not complement the pep12 mutation. The differential defect in the maturation of CPY provided a much clearer clue for assessing the functionality of AtVam3p in yeast cells. When the AtVAM3 was expressed from a constitutive promoter of TDH3, the amount of mature CPY (mCPY, 61-kDa form) increased, showing that the expression of the AtVAM3 complemented the defective maturation of CPY in Δvam3 cells (Fig.4). However, the defective maturation of CPY was not complemented by TDH3p-AtVAM3 in the Δpep12 mutant, as Δpep12 cells harboring theTDH3p-AtVAM3 construct accumulate only a limited amount of Golgi-modified p2-CPY (69-kDa form) but lacked mCPY, like Δpep12 cells harboring a control plasmid. This observation showed that the AtVAM3 failed to replace the function ofPEP12 in yeast cells. In summary, AtVAM3complemented the defective vacuolar morphology (Fig. 1) and CPY processing (Fig. 4) in the Δvam3 cells while it did not provide enough activity for rescue of the defective vacuolar biogenesis in the Δpep12 mutant. DNA blot analysis probed with the full-length AtVAM3 cDNA showed multiple bands when the blot was washed under low stringency conditions, suggesting that the AtVAM3-related gene exists in the A. thaliana genome (Fig.5 A). The coding regions of theAtVAM3 and aPEP12 share approximately 70% identity at the nucleotide sequence level, and the sizes of the weakly hybridizing bands agreed with the reported restriction patterns of theaPEP12 gene though the ecotypes used in these studies were different. Here we used ecotype Columbia while the aPEP12gene was characterized in ecotype RLD (27Bassham D.C. Gal S. da Silva Conceição A. Raikhel N.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7262-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The spatial expression pattern of AtVAM3 in plants was examined by Northern hybridization (Fig. 5 B). A transcript of 1.2 kilobases was identified, which agreed well with the length of the cDNA insert in the original clone. The expression of theAtVAM3 was seen in all tissues but at varying levels. In stems and roots, it was highly expressed, whereas the amount of transcript in leaves was relatively low, about one third of the level seen in stems and roots. We focused on the expression pattern ofAtVAM3 around a shoot apical meristem of young plants byin situ hybridization analysis (Fig.6). High uniform levels ofAtVAM3 transcript were detected in morphologically undifferentiated cells. The signal was much higher in these cells than more mature, vacuolated cells. High levels of expression were also detected in the leaf primordia and vascular tissues. To facilitate analyses of the protein product, we prepared a rabbit antibody for a GST-AtVam3p (residues 21–200) fusion protein. The specificity of the antibody was verified by the yeast expression system (Fig.7 A). The antibody recognized a 33-kDa protein in yeast cell lysates prepared from the galactose grown Δvam3 cells harboring theGAL1p-AtVAM3 construct. This protein was not found when the yeast was grown in the glucose medium, an indication that the 33-kDa protein is the product of AtVAM3. The antibody recognized a protein in the A. thaliana lysate which shows the same migration in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel as AtVam3p produced in yeast cells (Fig. 7 B). This protein was not recognized by the preimmune serum (data not shown). From these observations, we concluded that the 33-kDa protein is the product of the AtVAM3 gene. A similar expression level of AtVam3p was observed in various tissues (roots, leaves, stems, flowers, and green siliques) when samples were normalized for overall protein content (Fig. 7 B). We noted that the amount of AtVam3p in leaf was comparable with that in roots and stems while mRNA levels were lower in leaves than in roots and stems (Fig. 5). The subcellular localization of AtVam3p was examined both by subcellular fractionation by differential centrifugation and immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. 8). We speculated that AtVam3p may be localized on the vacuolar membranes because of its structural and functional similarities to the yeast vacuolar syntaxin, Vam3p. A post-nuclear supernatant of root was fractionated into LSP, HSP, and HSS fractions. Approximately 80% of AtVam3p was fractionated into the LSP fraction, and the remainder was found in the HSP fraction. A vacuolar membrane marker protein, H+-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase) showed a similar distribution in the differential centrifugation fractionation. This distribution pattern of AtVam3p supported our prediction that AtVam3p is localized to the vacuolar membranes in plant cells. Ultrathin sections of shoot apical meristem of A. thalianaseedlings were probed with the antibody against AtVam3p and protein A-conjugated colloidal gold. The gold particles were found on the membranes of small vacuoles (Fig. 9,A and B). In a mature cell with a larger vacuole, the staining was more dispersed (Fig. 9 C). This observation was consistent with the relatively lower transcript levels in the mature cells containing larger vacuoles (Fig. 6). AtVam3p was not distributed homogeneously on the vacuolar membrane. Rather, it appeared to accumulate in vacuoles that were interacting with one another (Fig.9, A and C, arrows). This suggests that AtVam3p functions in membrane-membrane interactions. A higher concentration of preimmune serum did not give any signal (data not shown). We concluded from both subcellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopic studies that AtVam3p is localized on the vacuolar membrane of plant cells. Syntaxins are the key molecules regulating intracellular vesicular traffic. The primary structure of syntaxins, however, are not highly conserved enough to allow design of PCR primers or hybridization probes. We used a functional screening strategy to find aVAM3 homologue from A. thaliana and identified a novel syntaxin-related molecule, AtVam3p. AtVam3p is structurally related to the yeast vacuolar syntaxin, Vam3p, it is able to replace the Vam3p function in yeast, and it is localized to the vacuolar membranes in plant cells. Taken together, we propose that AtVam3p provides the t-SNARE function at a certain step of the vacuolar assembly in A. thaliana. Bassham et al. (27Bassham D.C. Gal S. da Silva Conceição A.

A. 1995; 92: 7262-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) identified another syntaxin-related protein in Arabidopsis, aPep12p, by a similar approach using the yeast pep12 mutant. Our studies together endorse the great potential that heterologous expression and functional screenings have, even in distantly related organisms such as A. thaliana and S. cerevisiae. AtVam3p and aPep12p appear to be closely related in their structures (over 60% identity at the amino acid level). This argues that these two syntaxins represent redundancy in the A. thaliana genome. However, we do not believe they are executing the same function. In yeast, we and others have shown that pep12 mutants and vam3 mutants have different phenotypes, clearly indicating that they are involved in different steps of the vacuolar assembly in yeast cells (4Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18665-18670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wada Y. Nakamura N. Ohsumi Y. Hirata A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The expression of the AtVAM3 did not complement the defective vacuolar targeting and maturation of CPY in a pep12 mutant (this study), while aPep12p provides the Pep12p function in yeast cells (27Bassham D.C. Gal S. da Silva Conceição A. Raikhel N.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7262-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These observations predict that AtVam3p executes its function in a similar step where Vam3p does in yeast, while aPep12p performs its role in accepting the Golgi-derived transport vesicles on the prevacuolar/endosomal compartments as Pep12p does in yeast (13Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Since these studies addressed the functionality in yeast cells, we cannot rule out the possibility that AtVam3p and aPep12p provide redundant functions at a same stage of the vacuolar assembly in plant cells. We should also point out that heterologous expression and subsequent complementation alone may reflect functional cross-suppression or an artifact due to overexpression and mislocalization of the protein in question, especially when its expression is driven by a strong promoter like the GAL1 orTDH3 promoter. Therefore, the precise function of AtVam3p and aPep12p must ultimately be examined in plant cells. We have shown here that AtVam3p is localized to the vacuolar membranes. Most recently, aPep12p was reported to be localized to post-Golgi, endosome-like compartments that are clearly distinct from the vacuole (33da Silva Conceição A. Marty-Mazars D. Bassham D.C. Sanderfoot A.A. Marty F. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1-13Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This differential subcellular localization of these two related proteins supports our view that aPep12p and AtVam3p perform distinct functions at different stages of the vacuolar assembly. The vacuolar compartments in plant cells show heterogeneity; at the least, storage vacuoles and lytic vacuoles are distinct compartments containing different sets of proteins in their lumen and membranes (34Paris N. Stanley C.M. Jones R.L. Rogers J.C. Cell. 1996; 85: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In addition, these two compartments undergo dynamic exchange and fusion during the plant growth and development (34Paris N. Stanley C.M. Jones R.L. Rogers J.C. Cell. 1996; 85: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 35Strzalka K. Hara-Nishimura I. Nishimura M. Biochim. Biophys.

These dynamic processes of the plant vacuoles are also suggested by the studies of vacuolar protein targeting signals for various vacuolar proteins. In plant vacuolar proteins, at least three different classes of protein targeting signals are involved in protein sorting (37Bednarek S.Y. Wilkins T.A. Dombrowski J.E. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 38Dombrowski J.E. Schroeder M.R. Bednarek S.Y. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 587-596PubMed Google Scholar, 39Tague B.W.

A. 1991; 88: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and these signals seem to utilize different targeting mechanisms in the transport process from the Golgi to the vacuoles (41Matsuoka K. Bassham D.C. Raikhel N.V. Nakamura K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). As plant vacuoles are more diverse than their yeast counterparts both morphologically and biochemically, their assembly and dynamism must be regulated in a more sophisticated manner than in yeast cells. It is therefore likely that plant cells develop more elaborate systems for vesicular trafficking around the vacuolar compartments. According to the SNARE-hypothesis (6Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar), each compartment should be distinguished by a specific tag, otherwise the specificity of the compartments would be compromised by nonspecific fusion of transport vesicles. We have shown here that AtVam3p was not uniformly distributed on the vacuolar membranes. Interestingly, yeast Vam3p exhibits a patchy localization to restricted regions of the vacuolar membrane (5Wada Y. Nakamura N. Ohsumi Y. Hirata A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as is also true of the other yeast vacuolar assembly molecule, Vam6p (16Nakamura N. Hirata A. Ohsumi Y. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11344-11349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Large accumulations of AtVam3p on the membranes of small vacuoles suggests that AtVam3p is involved in vacuolar dynamics, for example, when two distinct, vegetative and storage vacuoles merge to develop large prominent vacuoles. These possibilities can be examined further by histological and immunocytochemical localization of AtVam3p during the plant developments.

https://openalex.org/W2063263589,"Mechanisms of ligand binding and activation of G protein-coupled receptors are particularly important, due to their ubiquitous expression and potential as drug targets. Molecular interactions between ligands and these receptors are best defined for small molecule ligands that bind within the transmembrane helices. Extracellular domains seem to be more important for peptide ligands, based largely on effects of receptor mutagenesis, where interference with binding or activity can reflect allosteric as well as direct effects. We now take the more direct approach of photoaffinity labeling the active site of the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor, using a photolabile analogue of CCK having a blocked amino terminus. This probe,125I-desaminotyrosyl-Gly-[Nle28,31,pNO2-Phe33]CCK-(26–33), binds specifically, saturably, and with high affinity (K i = 3.3 nm) and has full agonist activity. This makes likely its being sited in a natural position within the receptor. As substrate, we used CHO-CCK receptor cells overexpressing functional recombinant rat type A CCK receptor. Covalent labeling of the appropriate M r = 85,000–95,000 plasma membrane glycoprotein with core of M r = 42,000 was established by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. A single domain adjacent to transmembrane 1 was labeled, as established by cyanogen bromide cleavage and separation by gel and/or high pressure liquid chromatography. The site of interaction was further defined by additional proteolysis with trypsin, with purification of the labeled fragment, followed by manual Edman degradation and radiochemical sequencing. This demonstrated that Trp39 was specifically labeled and likely resides proximate to the carboxyl-terminal pNO2-Phe33 residue of the probe. A model of this ligand-bound receptor has been constructed and will be used to plan future experiments to refine our understanding of this interaction.

Our best understanding of the molecular basis for ligand binding to members of this superfamily is the binding of the chromophore to rhodopsin and the binding of biogenic amines to adrenergic receptors. These insights come from complementary studies of receptor mutagenesis, photoaffinity labeling, and reciprocal chemical modification of ligand and receptor (1Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J.

All available data focus the relevant interactions to sites at the core of the coalescence of transmembrane helices, in the outer third of the bilayer. Even with this extensive information, the constrained nature of the ligands, and the relatively confined space for ligand docking, the debate continues regarding the specific siting of the agonist ligands in some of these receptor systems (7Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 8Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Understanding the interactions between peptide ligands and their G protein-coupled receptors represents an even greater challenge. By first principles, these ligands are quite flexible and can achieve many conformations. Whereas some peptides appear to have some preferred conformation in solution (9Mammi S. Goodman M. Peggion E. Foffani M.T. Moroder L. Wuensch E. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1986; 27: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), there is little information regarding how such structures relate to the receptor-bound states of these ligands. Most of our insights into binding domains for peptide ligands have come from receptor mutagenesis studies, which have focused attention on receptor domains predicted to be outside the membrane (7Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 8Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Given the extended size of the pharmacophoric domains and the solubilities of the peptide ligands, these regions of interaction seem plausible. We know, however, that receptor mutagenesis can modify receptor function nonspecifically, interfering with biosynthetic processing or trafficking or having an allosteric effect, rather than necessarily directly interfering with a site of ligand-receptor interaction. For a very limited number of peptide receptors in this family, direct sites of contact have been recently described using photoaffinity labeling approaches (10Wong S.K.F. Slaughter C. Ruoho A.E. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7925-7928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kojro E. Eich P. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25797-25800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide hormone and neurotransmitter that has a wide spectrum of physiologic actions (14Mutt V. Glass G.B.J. Gastrointestinal Hormones. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1980: 169-221Google Scholar). These relate largely to control of nutrient assimilation, through regulation of gallbladder contraction, pancreatic exocrine secretion, gastric emptying and gut motility, and satiety. The type A CCK receptor is expressed on the gallbladder muscularis smooth muscle cell, the pancreatic acinar cell, smooth muscle and neurons at different positions along the gastrointestinal tract, and on select central nervous system nuclei. There is a large amount of primary structure-activity information defining the pharmacophoric domain of the CCK peptide to its carboxyl-terminal heptapeptide (15Ondetti M.A. Rubin B. Engel S.L. Pluscec J. Sheehan J.T. Am. J. Dig. Dis. 1970; 15: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This includes critical contributions by an unusual tyrosine sulfate and the carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine-amide, and important contributions by almost every residue within this domain. The structurally related type B CCK (gastrin) receptor has less extensive structural requirements for its ligands, with the carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide shared by CCK and gastrin adequate for high affinity binding and full agonist activity at that receptor (16Morley J.S. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1968; 170: 97-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gastrin is a very weak agonist at the type A CCK receptor, where it has a binding affinity greater than 3 orders of magnitude lower than CCK (14Mutt V. Glass G.B.J. Gastrointestinal Hormones. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1980: 169-221Google Scholar). Our current insights into the binding domain of the type A CCK receptor have come exclusively from mutagenesis of that receptor (17Mantamadiotis T. Baldwin G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1382-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Kopin A.S. McBride E.W. Quinn S.M. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Beinborn M. J. Biol.

While a large series of photolabile probes for this receptor have been developed and applied to identify the receptor molecule (20Rosenzweig S.A. Miller L.J. Jamieson J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1288-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 21Pearson R.K. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 869-876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Powers S.P.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), they have not yet been applied to define distinct sites of interaction up to the present time. Like the peptide receptors described above (7Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 8Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), predicted extracellular loop regions of the CCK receptor seem to be important. In this report, we have utilized photoaffinity labeling with a CCK analogue probe that incorporates a photolabile residue intrinsic to its pharmacophoric domain to identify a distinct site of interaction with the receptor. This was achieved by the application of chemical and enzymatic cleavage of the affinity labeled receptor, with the subsequent manual Edman degradation and radiochemical sequencing of the labeled fragment. Of particular interest, a domain within this receptor, which was previously shown to be important by receptor truncation and mutagenesis studies, does contain the residue we now identify as interacting with the carboxyl terminus of CCK. However, the previous work suggested that this was a site of interaction with the amino-terminal domain of CCK, based on the indirect correlation of effects on different CCK analogues (19Kennedy K. Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Maigret B. Martinez J. Moroder L. Frehel D. Gully D. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2920-2926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The model previously proposed placed the carboxyl terminus of CCK deep within the bilayer, among the transmembrane helices (19Kennedy K. Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Maigret B. Martinez J. Moroder L. Frehel D. Gully D. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2920-2926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), something not possible with the current finding. We now have one clear site of contact between distinct residues of agonist ligand and receptor. We present a new model that incorporates this new contact data and is consistent with a large body of agonist structure-activity relationship data for CCK A receptors. Synthetic CCK-8 was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). Previously characterized CCK analogues,d-Tyr-Gly-[Nle28,31]CCK-(26–33) andd-Tyr-Gly-[Nle28,31,pNO2-Phe33]CCK-(26–33), were synthesized in our laboratory as we previously described (22Powers S.P. Fourmy D. Gaisano H. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5295-5300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Desaminotyrosyl-Gly-[Nle28,31,pNO2-Phe33]CCK-(26–33), a photolabile analogue with a blocked amino terminus, was synthesized specifically for this project, purified, and characterized similarly to the previously reportedd-Tyr-Gly-[Nle28,31,pNO2-Phe33]CCK-(26–33) (22Powers S.P. Fourmy D. Gaisano H. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5295-5300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cyanogen bromide (CNBr), phenylisothiocyanate (PITC), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide were from Pierce; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride andN-(2-aminoethyl-1)-3-aminopropyl glass beads were from Sigma; soybean trypsin inhibitor and trypsin were from Worthington; digitonin was from Gallard-Schlesinger (Carle Place, NJ); wheat germ agglutinin-agarose was from EY Laboratories (San Mateo, CA). All other reagents were analytical grade. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the rat type A CCK receptor (CHO-CCKR), which was established and characterized in our laboratory (25Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), was used as source of receptors for the current study. Receptors were expressed in density approximately 25 times that on the pancreatic acinar cell (125,000 sites per CHO-CCKR cell), bound ligands with appropriate structural specificity, and were appropriately coupled to signaling machinery (25Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The cell line was cultured on tissue culture plastic in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% Fetal Clone-2 (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and was passaged twice per week. For study, cells were lifted mechanically and were triturated and washed. Enriched plasma membranes from these cells were prepared as we described (25Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The major new probe used in this work was desaminotyrosyl-Gly-[Nle28,31,pNO2Phe33]CCK-(26–33) (CCK analogue). This is quite analogous to thed-Tyr-Gly-[Nle28,31,pNO2-Phe33]CCK-(26–33) probe previously reported (22Powers S.P. Fourmy D. Gaisano H. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5295-5300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and characterized to represent a high affinity, full agonist at the CCK receptor, except for having its amino terminus blocked. This modification was critical to permit the radiochemical sequencing of the labeled receptor fragment, without the cleavage of the probe itself. This probe was synthesized and purified in our laboratory by solid and solution phase techniques, as we have previously reported (22Powers S.P. Fourmy D. Gaisano H. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5295-5300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The chemical identity of this product was confirmed by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. The CCK analogue was radioiodinated using the solid phase oxidant,N-chloro-benzenesulfonamide (IODO-BEADS, Pierce), and purification of the product by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography to 2000 Ci/mmol, as we have described (26Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The ability of the CCK analogue probe to bind to the type A CCK receptor was established in a standard binding assay (25Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This utilized a CCK-like radioligand (125I-d-Tyr-Gly-[Nle28,31]CCK-(26–33)) which has previously been extensively validated (27Pearson R.K. Powers S.P. Hadac E.M. Gaisano H. Miller L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and rat type A CCK receptor-bearing membranes from the CHO-CCKR cell line (25Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Assay tubes included approximately 10 pm radioligand, approximately 2–5 μg of membrane protein, and 0.5 ml of Krebs-Ringer/Hepes medium containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm KH2PO4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor. This was carried out in the absence or presence of variable concentrations of desaminotyrosyl-Gly-[Nle28,31,pNO2-Phe33]CCK-(26–33). Incubations were performed for 60 min at 25 °C, conditions adequate to achieve steady-state binding. Rapid separation of bound from free radioligand was accomplished with a Skatron cell harvester (Sterling, VA) using receptor-binding filter mats. Bound radioactivity was quantified with a gamma spectrometer, and data were analyzed using the competition-binding program in the Prism software suite (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The agonist activity of the CCK analogue probe was studied using an assay for stimulation of intracellular calcium activity in the CHO-CCKR cell line (25Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this assay, approximately 2 million cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in Krebs-Ringer/Hepes medium for 30 min at 37 °C. They were then washed and stimulated with variable concentrations of desaminotyrosyl-Gly-[Nle28,31,pNO2-Phe33]CCK-(26–33) at 37 °C, with fluorescence quantified in a Perkin-Elmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer (Norwalk, CT). Excitation was performed at 340 and 380 nm, and emissions were determined at 520 nm, with calcium concentration calculated from the ratios, as described by Grynkiewiczet al. (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The peak intracellular calcium transient was utilized to determine the concentration dependence of the biological response. For the covalent labeling of the binding domain of the CCK receptor, receptor-bearing membranes from the CHO-CCKR cells were incubated with the125I-desaminotyrosyl-Gly-[Nle28,31,pNO2-Phe33]CCK-(26–33) under the same conditions described above for the binding assay, except using larger amounts of membrane (50–100 μg) and radioligand (0.1–1 nm). After binding, membranes were photolyzed using a Rayonet photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet Co., Hamden, CT) equipped with 3000-Å lamps for 30 min at 4 °C. After photolysis, membranes were washed and solubilized using 1% digitonin at 4 °C overnight. The radiolabeled and solubilized CCK receptors were enriched by adsorption to wheat germ agglutinin-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by washing and electrophoretic elution in 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer and electrophoresis through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel according to the conditions described by Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206271) Google Scholar). Aliquots of affinity-adsorbed receptor were deglycosylated by treatment for 2 h at 37 °C with 2 units of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase F (endo F) in buffer containing 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.1, 50 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. This was also then separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After identification of the radiolabeled CCK receptor band by autoradiography, it was excised and eluted by suspension in water and Dounce homogenization. This material was then lyophilized, and the radiolabeled receptor was precipitated in 85% ethanol at −20 °C overnight. Affinity labeled, lectin-purified CCK receptor, in its native or deglycosylated state, was then cleaved with CNBr. For this, the sample was incubated with 2.5 mg of CNBr in 70% formic acid in the dark at 25 °C for 48 h. Sample volumes were then reduced under vacuum in a vacuum centrifuge, and solvent exchange into water was accomplished. The products of cleavage were then separated on a 10% NuPAGE gel (Novex, San Diego, CA) using MES running buffer and visualized by autoradiography. Affinity labeled CCK receptor or its purified CNBr fragments were also cleaved with trypsin. For this, up to 8 mg/ml trypsin was utilized in 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.8, treating for 24 h at 25 °C. Products of digestion were then separated on a Tris-Tricine gel (30Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10449) Google Scholar) or on a 10% NuPAGE gel, as described above. Products were again visualized by autoradiography. When it was clear that the expected product was present and in good yield, it was then purified by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography. This was performed on a Beckman system equipped with a Vydac (214TP5415) analytical C-4 column, utilizing a 1 ml/min flow rate and a gradient of increasing acetonitrile with a background of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The gradient consisted of the following: 1% solution B for 5 min, advancing from 1 to 25% solution B over 5 min, advancing from 25 to 60% solution B over 25 min, advancing from 60 to 99% solution B over 5 min, and retaining the 99% solution B flow for another 5 min. A 254 nm was monitored on line and 1-ml fractions had radioactivity quantified with a gamma spectrometer. Select peak fractions were further characterized by separation on an appropriate gel by electrophoresis, with visualization by autoradiography. Purified fragments were sequenced using manual Edman degradation chemistry. For this, the purified fragment was dissolved in 100 mm MES, pH 5.0, containing 10 mg/ml 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 20% acetonitrile. Coupling to 20 mg ofN-(2-aminoethyl-1)-3-aminopropyl glass beads was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 25 °C. The beads were then washed sequentially with the following: 200 μl of methanol two times, 200 μl of methanol:water (1:1, v:v) two times, and 200 μl of methanol two times. This was followed by treatment with 50 μl of trifluoroacetic acid followed by 200-μl methanol washes, repeating this three times. The solvents were then eliminated under vacuum, and the beads were manually cycled through steps of alkalinization, covalent modification with PITC, washing, cleavage with trifluoroacetic acid, and elution. The cycles included the following: (i) beads were suspended in 50 μl of triethylamine and brought to dryness under vacuum, repeating three times; (ii) 60 μl of triethylamine:methanol:PITC (1:7:1, v:v) were added and incubated for 5 min at 50 °C; (iii) three sequential 400 μl of ethyl acetate washes were performed; (iv) beads were brought to dryness under vacuum in a Speed Vac centrifuge, and 50 μl of trifluoroacetic acid were added and incubated for 5 min at 25 °C; and (v) elution was performed with three successive washes using 200 μl of methanol. Radioactivity in each pooled eluate was quantified by gamma spectrometer. A cycle (number 0) was performed excluding the PITC step to ensure elution of all non-covalently bound radiolabeled fragments, before initiating cycle 1. Three-dimensional models for rat CCK-A receptor were constructed using methods described previously for adrenergic receptors (31MaloneyHuss K. Lybrand T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 859-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Kontoyianni M. DeWeese C. Penzotti J.E. Lybrand T.P. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 4406-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, seven-helix bundles were constructed, using our previous models for α-1 and β-adrenergic receptors as templates. Both clockwise and counterclockwise helical bundle clusters were built. Extracellular and cytosolic loop segments were then attached in an extended conformation to a target helix in the bundle, and weak harmonic constraints were applied to ligate the free end of each loop segment with the second target helix during a short, low temperature molecular dynamics simulation. The peptide was docked manually into the extracellular loop region of the receptor models using interactive molecular graphics methods. The peptide was initially docked in a standard β-hairpin conformation in the receptor models. After manual docking, limited energy minimization and low temperature molecular dynamics calculations were used to relieve any residual bad steric contacts and to optimize the peptide-receptor interactions. All energy minimization and molecular dynamics calculations were performed using AMBER 4.1 (33Pearlman, D. A., Case, D. A., Caldwell, J. C., Seibel, G. L., Singh, U. C., Weiner, P., and Kollman, P. A. (1991) AMBER, Version 4.1, University of California, San FranciscoGoogle Scholar), with a united atom potential function (34Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Nguyen D.T. Case D.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3589) Google Scholar). Interactive graphics model building was performed using the PSSHOW package (35Swanson, E. (1995) PSSHOW: Silicon Graphics, Version 4D, Seattle, WAGoogle Scholar). Desaminotyrosyl-Gly-[Nle28,31, pNO2-Phe33]CCK-(26–33) was synthesized and purified and corresponded to the expected structure as demonstrated by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. Also, as expected, it bound to the type A CCK receptor saturably and with high affinity (K i = 3.3 ± 0.3 nm) (Fig. 1). Nonspecific binding, determined in the presence of 1 μm CCK, represented less than 15% total binding. This analogue of CCK was a full agonist, stimulating an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2). This response was not different from that stimulated by natural CCK in the same cells (25Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The photolabile CCK analogue covalently labeled the CCK receptor, as demonstrated by autoradiography of SDS-polyacrylamide gels used to separate the products after binding in the presence of increasing amounts of competing unlabeled CCK (Fig. 3). The electrophoretic migration of the specifically labeledM r = 85,000–95,000 band was identical to that previously observed with a series of photolabile analogues of this hormone (22Powers S.P. Fourmy D. Gaisano H. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5295-5300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Klueppelberg U.G. Gaisano H.Y. Powers S.P. Miller L.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3463-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic migration of the deglycosylated band was also as expected from previous studies (36Pearson R.K. Miller L.J. Hadac E.M. Powers S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13850-13856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (M r = 42,000). Cyanogen bromide cleavage of the affinity labeled CCK receptor yielded a single labeled fragment migrating at apparent M r = 25,000 (Fig.4 A). The same cleavage of the deglycosylated receptor yielded a single band with apparentM r = 8,500 (Fig. 4 A). There is only one possible cyanogen bromide fragment of the CCK receptor that could account for this electrophoretic migration (Fig. 4 B). Only the fragment extending from residue 10 to 72 (using a numbering scheme common to the type A CCK receptors cloned from other species, recog"

Alternative splicing of vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA results in three distinct molecular forms: V189 and V165 or V121 which lack the exons 6 or 6 and 7, respectively. To clarify the functions of the 24-amino acid insertion, the biological activity of V165 was compared with that exerted by purified recombinant V189 and a synthetic peptide designed on the sequence encoded by exon 6 (Ex6P). V189 and Ex6P, but not V165, induced cell proliferation on corneal endothelial cells cultured in vitro. These effects were due to the release of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) stored in the extracellular matrix but not to direct interactions with FGF receptors since V189 was inefficient on heparan sulfate-deficient cells expressing constitutively FGF-R1. Moreover corneas incubated ex vivo with Ex6P solubilized 10-fold more FGF2 than a isocationic peptide containing a scrambled sequence. Ex6P elicited an angiogenic response in a corneal pocket assay which was totally inhibited by addition of anti-FGF2 IgG. Moreover the angiogenic response to V189, but not to V165, was inhibited by FGF2 immunoneutralization. These findings demonstrate that the presence of the exon 6-encoded sequence confers VEGF with the ability to exert its biological effects through FGF2 signaling pathways.

Sprouting of new capillaries from preexisting vessels, or angiogenesis, occurs in several physiological or pathological conditions such as tumor progression, diabetic retinopathy, or rheumatoid arthritis (1Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7177) Google Scholar). This local hypervascularization is thought to result from the release by the tissues of growth factors interacting with their receptors on endothelial cells which in turn migrate, proliferate, and differentiate into new capillaries. Several growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor 1 and 2 (FGF1, FGF2) 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; Ex6P, synthetic peptide RGKGKGQKRKRKKSRY; SP, synthetic peptide RKGKRQKGRKGKSKYR; V165, vascular endothelial growth factor 165; V189, vascular endothelial growth factor 189; uPA-V189, urokinase-cleaved V189; Pl-V189, plasmin-cleaved V189; PlGF, placenta growth factor 152; FBAE, bovine fetal aortic endothelial cells; BCE, bovine corneal endothelial cells; pgsA-745, heparan sulfate-deficient CHO cells; BHK, baby hamster kidney cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor.1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; Ex6P, synthetic peptide RGKGKGQKRKRKKSRY; SP, synthetic peptide RKGKRQKGRKGKSKYR; V165, vascular endothelial growth factor 165; V189, vascular endothelial growth factor 189; uPA-V189, urokinase-cleaved V189; Pl-V189, plasmin-cleaved V189; PlGF, placenta growth factor 152; FBAE, bovine fetal aortic endothelial cells; BCE, bovine corneal endothelial cells; pgsA-745, heparan sulfate-deficient CHO cells; BHK, baby hamster kidney cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor. or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are angiogenic in vivo.

The transcripts encoding the 165- and 121-amino acid forms are freely soluble in the tissue culture medium. In contrast a longer transcript encodes a 189-amino acid form with a 24-amino acid peptide corresponding to exon 6 of the gene which appears to bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix and the cell membrane (13Houck K.A. Leung D.W. Rowland A.M. Winer J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26031-26037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These authors suggest that V189 sequestration would provide a reserve of biologically active growth factor from which the V189 species can be released by heparin or through proteolysis following plasminogen conversion into plasmin. VEGF binds to two different receptors Flt-1 (14De Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar) and KDR (15Terman B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E. Dimitrov D. Armellino D.C. Gospodarowicz D. Böhlen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar) or its murine homologue Flk-1 (16Quinn T.P. Peters K.G. DeVries C. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7533-7537Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The binding domains of VEGF to Flt-1 and KDR/Flk-1 have been identified as the sequences 63–67 and 82–86, respectively (17Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that native V189 binds to Flt-1 but requires a cleavage by urokinase located within the exon 6-encoded sequence to bind to KDR/Flk-1 and to exert a mitogenic effect on vascular endothelial cells (18Plouët J.

However the mitogenic effect of the shorter form generated by plasmin cleavage between Arg110 and Ala111 was reduced 10–100-fold as compared with that of urokinase-matured V189 (18Plouët J. Moro F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13390-13396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) or V165 (19Keyt B.A. Berleau L.T. Nguyen H.V. Chen H. Heinsohn H. Vandlen R. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7788-7795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Because these results suggested that exon 6 acted as a mitogenic enhancer, we then compared the physiological roles exerted by V165, V189, and a synthetic peptide designed on the sequence encoded by exon 6 (Ex6P). It appeared that, in contrast to V165, V189 and Ex6P could exert a mitogenic activity, even in the absence of KDR/Flk-1 activation, providing the target cells expressed and stored FGF2 in their cell membranes and extracellular matrix. The use of neutralizing antibodies against FGF2 showed that this biological activity was due to the release of FGF2 bound to cell membranes in vitro,ex vivo, and in vivo. Accordingly V189, in contrast to FGF2, did not promote cell migration in CHO cells transfected with FGF-R1. These findings demonstrate that the presence of the exon 6-encoded sequence confers VEGF with the ability to exert its biological effects through FGF2 signaling pathways.DISCUSSIONThe data presented in this paper show that, besides information for extracellular matrix or membrane retention, the 24-amino acid insertion of V189 also contains information to activate the FGF2 signaling pathways in vitro as well as in vivo.VEGF is the angiogenic growth factor which seems the most vessel-specific in vivo. Nevertheless VEGF exerts mitogenic effects on several cultured cells such as vascular endothelial cells, T lymphocytes, retinal pigment epithelial cells (2Ferrara N. Henzel W.J. Biochem. Biophys.

Bertrand N. Enjolras O. Drouet L. Plouët J. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1315-1326PubMed Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA generates 3 distinct isoforms. We had previously demonstrated that V189 is secreted by heparan sulfate-deficient CHO cells and further sequestered on two different binding sites. Its release requires a cleavage by urokinase which allows V189 to bind to KDR/Flk-1 and to exert a mitogenic effect on vascular endothelial cells (18Plouët J. Moro F. Bertagnolli S. Coldeboeuf N.

However the shorter form generated by plasmin cleavage between Arg110 and Ala111 exerted a mitogenic effect that was reduced by 50-fold compared with that of urokinase-matured V189. Since both Pl-V189 and uPA-V189 bound equally to the VEGF receptors, these results suggest that exon 6 behaved as a mitogenic enhancer. Surprisingly uPA-V189 could induce thymidine incorporation on corneal endothelial cells despite the fact that these cells did not express KDR/Flk-1 (26Bednardz J. Weich H.A. Rodokanaki-von Schrenck A. Engelmann K. Cornea. 1995; 14: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the VEGF receptor mediating cell proliferation (27Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L.

Enjolras O. Drouet L. Plouët J. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1315-1326PubMed Google Scholar). This observation suggested that uPA-V189 mitogenic activity was exerted through the activation of other growth factor pathways. Several recent studies have pointed out that V165 and FGF2 signaling pathways might synergize to trigger angiogenesis in vitroand in vivo (29Goto F. Goto K. Weindel K. Folkman J. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 508-517PubMed Google Scholar). However we did not notice any synergy between V165 and FGF2 for the proliferation of cells cultured on plastic, confirming our previous results (30Plouët J. Moukadiri H. Biochimie. 1990; 72: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but we observed that uPA-V189-dependent proliferation of BCE cells was blocked by neutralizing anti-FGF2 IgG. We then focused on the possible interactions of VEGF and FGF2.FGF2 interacts with specific high affinity receptors and heparan sulfate proteoglycans to form trimolecular complexes on the cell surface (31Klagsbrun M. Baird A. Cell. 1991; 67: 229-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The FGF receptors, like the VEGF receptors, are tyrosine kinases which contain three immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular portion of the molecule, instead of seven for the VEGF receptors. The binding of FGF2 to heparan sulfate moieties of proteoglycans increases its affinity for the FGF receptor tyrosine kinases (32Roghani M. Mansukhani A. Dell'Era P. Bellosta P. Basilico C. Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3976-3984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and allows its storage in the cell membranes and extracellular matrix (33Flaumenhaft R. Moscatelli D. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Biol. 1990; 111: 1651-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The inhibition of iodinated FGF2 cross-linking to its receptors by peptides containing the basic sequence encoded by exon 6 of VEGF might result from a direct activation of the FGF receptors or from competition with FGF2. The first possibility was ruled out by the finding that V189, uPA-V189, or Ex6P could not induce cell migration or proliferation on BHK cells which do not synthesize FGF2. Moreover the use of heparan sulfate-deficient CHO cells expressing constitutively the VEGF receptors demonstrated that homodimerization of Flt-1 obtained by PlGF or V165 was sufficient to trigger cell migration. In contrast to the report of Waltenberger et al. (27Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that Flk-1 activation was not sufficient to promote chemotaxis. Interestingly native V189 and the PlGF 2 splice variant, which both contain a basic sequence encoded by exon 6, could bind to Flt-1 and induce cell migration on these cells. The finding that V189 was not chemotactic for FGF-R1-expressing pgs-A745 CHO cells also favored the second hypothesis. In fact uPA-V189 and Ex6P, but not V165, could (i) compete with FGF2 binding to its receptors, (ii) release FGF2 in vitro and ex vivo, (iii) induce a mitogenic effect only on target cells which express FGF2 and store it in their membranes and extracellular matrix, and (iv) have anti-FGF2 neutralizing antibodies block their mitogenic and angiogenic activities. In addition the discrepancy observed between the lack of mitogenic activity exertedin vitro by native V189 and its strong angiogenic activityin vivo suggests that its maturation occurs in vivo.Several reports (34Khachigian L.M. Chesterman C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7478-7482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Raines E.W. Russel R. J. Cell. Biol. 1992; 116: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) have characterized the interactions of a synthetic peptide, representing the alternatively spliced exon 6 of PDGF A-chain, with a large population of cell surface binding sites. The amino acid sequences of exon 6 of the PDGF A-chain and exon 6 of the VEGF are closely related (36Betsholtz C. Rorsman F. Westermark B. Ostman A. Heldin C.-H. Nature. 1990; 344: 299Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with 6 consecutive residues in common but in the reverse sense (KRKRKK instead of KKRKRK). Both groups concluded in the glycosaminoglycan nature of the binding sites. These synthetic peptides also prevented the binding and mitogenic effects of the two splice variants of PDGF AA, FGF2 and EGF, to 3T3 cells. We also found that Ex6P or SP concentrations above 100 μminhibited the binding and mitogenic effect of exogenously added growth factors such as FGF2, V165, or serum (data not shown). Accordingly FGF2 and V189, but not V165, could release up to 60% of the amount of iodinated FGF2 previously bound to cell membranes and extracellular matrix with an IC50 in the nanomolar range, a value close to the K d of FGF2 for heparan sulfate proteoglycans (37Moscatelli D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Ex6P and SP released iodinated FGF2 bound to BCE or FBAE cells as a function of the dose, but the IC50 corresponding to Ex6P was 15-fold lower and the total amount released was almost twice that released by SP. These data suggest that beside competition of cationic peptides with heparan sulfates, other membrane binding sites would interact with the exon 6-encoded sequence, possibly through a protein-protein interaction. Such a binding site for the VEGF exon 6-encoded sequence has been recently purified as 69–75-kDa “CRS-BP1” proteins (38Boensch C. Kuo M.-D. Connolly D.T. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1807-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In fact we observed that the exon 6-encoded sequence conferred VEGF with the ability to bind to heparan sulfate-deficient cells (18Plouët J. Moro F. Bertagnolli S. Coldeboeuf N. Mazarguil H. Clamens S. Bayard F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13390-13396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Another group recently identified a splice variant of VEGF lacking the exon 7 (39Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Sivan R. Kandelis Y. Spira G. Vlodavsky I. Keshet E. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7151-7158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). They also observed that this VEGF variant was able to bind to the extracellular matrix even after pretreatment with chlorate which prevents the sulfation of heparan proteoglycans. The finding that Ex6P released FGF2 from fresh corneas ex vivo was physiologically relevant since the peptide alone was sufficient to elicit corneal angiogenesis through this indirect mechanism involving FGF2 signaling pathways.These results demonstrate the dual mechanism of the action of V189 schematized on Fig. 9. The folding of native V189 would mask its binding domain to Flk-1 (amino acids 82–86, Ref. 17Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), but its binding domain to Flt-1 (amino acids 63–67, Ref. 17Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T.

The sequences encoded by exons 6 and 7 mediate V189 binding to CRS-BP1 (Ref. 38Boensch C. Kuo M.-D. Connolly D.T. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1807-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and to proteoheparan sulfate (Refs. 19Keyt B.A. Berleau L.T. Nguyen H.V. Chen H. Heinsohn H. Vandlen R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), respectively. The binding to these two distinct sites anchors V189 in the plasma membrane (Ref. 18Plouët J. Moro F. Bertagnolli S. Coldeboeuf N. Mazarguil H. Clamens S. Bayard F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13390-13396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). When V189 is cleaved by urokinase it can interact with the two VEGF receptors and release FGF2 from its storage sites, which in turn can activate the FGF receptors. When V189 is cleaved by plasmin it does not interact with CRS-BP1 or proteoheparan sulfates and does not release FGF2. It might be of interest to determine if other basic sequences encoded by exons 6 of the A or B chains of PDGF or PlGF can also release bioactive FGF2 from extracellular matrix. Sprouting of new capillaries from preexisting vessels, or angiogenesis, occurs in several physiological or pathological conditions such as tumor progression, diabetic retinopathy, or rheumatoid arthritis (1Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7177) Google Scholar). This local hypervascularization is thought to result from the release by the tissues of growth factors interacting with their receptors on endothelial cells which in turn migrate, proliferate, and differentiate into new capillaries.

Molecular cloning of human cDNA has shown that the factor is in fact composed of multiple species which are generated after alternative splicing of a single RNA transcribed from a single gene (9Keck P.J.

The transcripts encoding the 165- and 121-amino acid forms are freely soluble in the tissue culture medium. In contrast a longer transcript encodes a 189-amino acid form with a 24-amino acid peptide corresponding to exon 6 of the gene which appears to bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix and the cell membrane (13Houck K.A.

These authors suggest that V189 sequestration would provide a reserve of biologically active growth factor from which the V189 species can be released by heparin or through proteolysis following plasminogen conversion into plasmin. VEGF binds to two different receptors Flt-1 (14De Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar) and KDR (15Terman B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E. Dimitrov D. Armellino D.C. Gospodarowicz D. Böhlen P. Biochem.

The binding domains of VEGF to Flt-1 and KDR/Flk-1 have been identified as the sequences 63–67 and 82–86, respectively (17Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that native V189 binds to Flt-1 but requires a cleavage by urokinase located within the exon 6-encoded sequence to bind to KDR/Flk-1 and to exert a mitogenic effect on vascular endothelial cells (18Plouët J.

However the mitogenic effect of the shorter form generated by plasmin cleavage between Arg110 and Ala111 was reduced 10–100-fold as compared with that of urokinase-matured V189 (18Plouët J. Moro F.

Because these results suggested that exon 6 acted as a mitogenic enhancer, we then compared the physiological roles exerted by V165, V189, and a synthetic peptide designed on the sequence encoded by exon 6 (Ex6P).

The gene for this enzyme is regulated by a number of inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-γ. Transcriptional activation of the gene is dependent on the interferon-γ-induced transcription factor, interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1).

The region of binding is then extended both in a 5′ and 3′ direction on formation of the dimeric complex, with additional contacts in the minor groove of DNA. Binding of the second molecule of IRF-1 is dependent on the presence of the initial bound protein. Sequential binding of IRF-1 to form a dimeric complex has not been described previously, and we show that formation of this dimeric complex is essential for full activation of the iNOS gene by cytokines in vascular smooth muscle cells.

Sakakibara J. Sudo Y. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Taniguchi T. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3397-3405Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning revealed it to be a DNA-binding protein with a basic NH2-terminal domain linked to an acidic COOH-terminal region which is highly conserved between mice and humans (2Miyamoto M. Fujita T. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Harada H. Sudo Y. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1988; 54: 903-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The NH2 terminus is responsible for DNA binding, whereas sequences within the COOH-terminal domain mediate transactivation (3Fijita T. Kimura Y. Miyamoto M. Barsoumian E.L. Taniguchi T.

IRF-1 is generally present only at low levels within resting cells; but after treatment with either type I or type II IFN, transcription of the IRF-1 gene is increased, and levels of IRF-1 protein rise dramatically (2Miyamoto M.

In addition, IRF-1 production is induced by other cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α (6Fujita T. Reis L.F.L. Watanabe N. Kimura Y. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Evans, unpublished observations. where it binds to a DNA motif with the sequence G(A)AAA(G/C)(T/C)-GAAA(G/C)(T/C) (8Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). This motif has been found in the upstream promoter elements of a number of IFN-inducible genes such as IFN-β (9Ohno S. Taniguchi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 5403-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), major histocompatibility complex class I (10Johnson D.R. Pober J.S. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1987; 7: 4498-4504Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A number of studies have shown the importance of IRF-1 in mediating transcriptional up-regulation of these and other IFN-induced genes (8Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). IRF-1 has additional functions in cellular growth. Molecular cloning revealed that IRF-1 belongs to a gene family of related proteins, the closest of which is termed IRF-2 (4Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). This binds to the same sequence motif as IRF-1, but in general it acts as a repressor rather than a transcriptional activator. Further work has demonstrated that IRF-1 and -2 have opposing actions on cell growth, with IRF-1 acting as a growth inhibitor, whereas cells overexpressing IRF-2 showed a transformed growth phenotype and enhanced tumorigenicity (12Harada H. Kitagawa M. Tanaka N. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Ishihara M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1993; 259: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). IRF-1 levels in the cell are linked to the cell cycle, with peak amounts in growth arrest which decline after serum stimulation (12Harada H. Kitagawa M. Tanaka N. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Ishihara M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1993; 259: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). A role for IRF-1 as a tumor repressor is supported by the observation that the human IRF-1 gene is often deleted in patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes (13Willman C.L. Sever C.E. Pallavicini M.G. Harada H. Tanaka N. Slovak M.L. Yamamoto H. Harada K. List A.F. Taniguchi T. Science. 1993; 259: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Recently, the gene for inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) has been shown to be regulated by IRF-1 (14Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Le J. Koh S.I. Kimura T.

Med. 1994; 180: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide (NO) is a mediator of many diverse physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. It is a major determinant of resting vascular tone in mammals (16Palmer R.M.J. Ferrige A.G. Moncada S. Nature. 1987; 327: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (9366) Google Scholar), it can act as a microbicidal and tumoristatic agent (17Nathan C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1991; 3: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar), and, inter alia also acts as a neurotransmitter at glutamate receptors in the brain (18Garthwaite J. Charles S.L. Chess-Williams R. Nature. 1988; 336: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (2284) Google Scholar). Three related enzymes can synthesize NO in different tissues. Two of these, the brain and endothelial forms, are generally constitutively present in the cells where they are found, but the third, iNOS, is usually only produced after transcriptional activation of its gene (19Nathan C. Xie Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Potent activators include proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, which synergize in the production of iNOS in a variety of cell types (20Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4161) Google Scholar). Originally described in macrophages, iNOS is found in a number of different cells ranging from vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells to astrocytes (20Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4161) Google Scholar). Its function differs depending on the cell type. In macrophages, NO produced from iNOS is responsible for their microbicidal and tumoristatic properties. In VSM cells, NO production from iNOS produces smooth muscle relaxation. This is responsible for the hypotension seen in bacterial sepsis, a condition in which high circulating levels of endotoxin and proinflammatory cytokines combine to induce iNOS in VSM (21Glauser M.P. Zanetti G. Baumgartner J.-D. Cohen J. Lancet. 1991; 338: 732-736Abstract PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Cloning of the iNOS promoter in mice and rats has shown the presence of a number of potential IRF-1 binding sites (22Xie Q.-W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 23Eberhardt W. Kunz D. Hummel R. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Deletion and mutational analyses have shown the importance of sequences in the region of the promoter from −890 to −1002 in induction by IFN-γ (15Martin E. Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Exp.

Site-directed mutagenesis and competition experiments have suggested that IRF-1 binding at a site found between positions −913 and −923 is required for full synergistic effects of IFN-γ in induction of the iNOS gene (14Kamijo R.

In addition, mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the IRF-1 gene are unable to produce iNOS, again demonstrating the importance of this transcription factor in iNOS induction (14Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Le J. Koh S.I. Kimura T. Green S.J. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J. Science. 1994; 263: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The transcription factor NF-κB is also essential for cytokine activation of the iNOS gene (24Spink J. Cohen J. Evans T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29541-29547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The IRF gene family does not have any sequence similarity to those of other known transcription factors. NMR studies on IRF-2 suggest that the IRF family proteins contain a helix-turn-helix-like domain that mediates DNA binding (25Uegaki K. Shirakawa M. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Kyogoku Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Unlike the majority of transcription factors, IRF-1 appears to bind as a monomer to a single IRF-1 site through its NH2-terminal domain (8Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Early studies have shown that contacts within its binding site are made to the major groove of DNA (4Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). In two studies of IRF-1 action in transcriptional up-regulation, IRF-1 has been shown to facilitate the binding of other transcription factors such as NF-κB (26Neish A.S. Read M.A. Thanos D. Pine R. Maniatis T. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2558-2569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the structural DNA-binding protein, high mobility group protein-(I)Y (27Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Thus, IRF-1 binding to DNA and other proteins is central to the formation of transcription factor complexes, or enhanceosomes, which mediate the transcriptional regulation of a number of IFN-regulated genes. Given the importance of IRF-1 in iNOS gene induction, we set out to determine how IRF-1 up-regulates transcription of this gene and possibly interacts with other transcription factors responsible for iNOS transcriptional control. We wished to determine the site or sites within the iNOS enhancer at which IRF-1 binds and its importance in regulating iNOS gene transcription. In this study, we show that binding of IRF-1 occurs initially to a single high affinity site within the iNOS promoter. This initial binding then allows the binding of a second molecule of IRF-1 to form a ternary DNA·protein complex. This second molecule of IRF-1 does not bind at a separate well defined canonical IRF-1 site but produces an extension of the area of DNA in contact with IRF-1 in both a 5′ and 3′ direction. Formation of this complex is essential for full cytokine activation of the gene. A7r5 rat VSM cells were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures at Porton Down, U. K. They were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units ml−1 penicillin, and 100 μg ml−1streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of humidified 5% CO2. The protein coding sequence of murine IRF-1 was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on cDNA prepared from IFN-γ-treated L929 cells and appropriate primers derived from the NH2 and COOH termini of the protein; these primers contained terminal BamHI sites. After amplification, the product was purified from an agarose gel, digested withBamHI, and cloned into the BamHI site of the vector pET19b (Novagen). Clones with the insert in the correct orientation for protein expression were transformed into the bacterial strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). This bacterium produces T7 RNA polymerase under lacUV5control. The expression of mRNA from the pET19b plasmid is under the control of T7 polymerase, so that induction of cells with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside leads to accumulation of RNA and protein from the cloned insert. A 50-ml culture of cells was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h according to the manufacturer's protocol, collected by centrifugation, and lysed in 5 ml of binding buffer (Novagen) containing 100 μg ml−1 lysozyme and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at 30 °C. Released DNA was sheared by sonication and inclusion bodies collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Inclusion bodies were solubilized in 5 ml of binding buffer containing 6 m urea for 1 h on ice with occasional vortexing. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was clarified by passing through a 0.22-μm filter before purifying the His-tag-containing protein using immobilized metal affinity chromatography in a kit (Novagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified protein was dialyzed overnight into 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA containing 5m urea. Renaturation was then allowed to continue by dialyzing into buffers containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0); 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm dithiothreitol; and 4, 2, 1, and 0 m urea, respectively. The purity of the recombinant protein was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was greater than 95% in all cases. Aliquots of the pure protein were stored at −80 °C. Enterokinase (Boehringer Mannheim) digestion was performed with 1:40 w/w protease:IRF-1 in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 3m urea for 16 h at 37 °C. After digestion, any remaining His-tag was removed by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, and the flow-through from the column was then renatured as described above. Complete removal of the His-tag was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which demonstrated that the product was all of a lower molecular weight. Truncated derivatives of IRF-1 lacking amino acids at either the NH2 or COOH terminus of the protein were constructed using PCR with primers designed to introduce a stop codon at the required termination point (for COOH-terminal deletions) in the IRF-1 coding sequence or to start the protein at an internal site (for NH2-terminal deletions). Such mutated sequences were cloned into pET19b and expressed and purified as described above. The 99-bp fragment of the iNOS promoter extending from position −979 to −881 was radiolabeled using the primers GTGCTAGGGGGATTTTCCCTCTC (forward) and GCATTCACACATGGCATGG (reverse) in a modified PCR in a volume of 100 μl containing reaction buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 9.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2.5 mm MgCl2); a 0.1 mm concentration each of dGTP, dTTP, and dATP; 0.025 mm dCTP; 50 μCi of [α32P]dCTP (∼3,000 Ci mmol−1); 50 pmol of each primer; and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. Added template (0.1 μg) was a purified 99-bp fragment made in this reaction with no added radiolabel. The PCR was performed as follows: denaturation for 5 min at 95 °C, then 28 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C, followed by one incubation of 10 min at 72 °C. Radiolabeled product was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and required no further purification before use. For the experiment shown in Fig. 6, duplex oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with polynucleotide kinase. EMSAs were performed in 20-μl reactions containing 10 mmTris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 100 μg ml−1poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC), 1 μl of DNA probe (∼100,000 cpm), and added DNA-binding protein as indicated. Immediately before use, an aliquot of recombinant IRF-1 was diluted to the required concentration in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin. Incubations were for 15 min at room temperature. DNA·protein complexes were then separated on native 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer which were prerun for 1 h before sample loading. Gels were run at room temperature for 2 h at 13 V cm−1, dried, and autoradiographed with an intensifying screen at −80 °C using Kodak X-Omat AR film. For footprinting DNA·protein complexes, probe labeled on one strand of duplex DNA was prepared with the PCR described above, but using one of the primers already radiolabeled at the 5′ terminus with polynucleotide kinase, omitting the radiolabeled dCTP, and increasing the concentration of dCTP to 0.1 mm in the reaction mixture. Methylation interference analysis was performed as described (28Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and ethylation interference as described (29Wissman A. Hillen W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Missing nucleoside analysis was performed as described (30Dixon W.J. Hayes J.J. Levin J.R. Weidner M.F. Dombroski B.A. Tullius T.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 380-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Approximately 100 ng of radiolabeled probe was prepared in 70 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA (TE). In one single pipette tip the following reagents were drawn up, with an air bubble between each: 10 μl of 100 mm sodium ascorbate, 10 μl of 0.6% H2O2, and 10 μl of a freshly prepared mixture of 10 mm iron(II) ammonium sulfate, 20 mm EDTA. These were added together to allow instantaneous mixing with the labeled DNA in the same tube. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 min at room temperature before quenching with the addition of 30 μl of 0.1 m thiourea, 10 μl of 0.2 m EDTA, 20 μl of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2), and 40 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA. Gapped probe was precipitated with ethanol twice and resuspended in 20 μl of TE; 5 μl was used in one gel shift reaction. In all cases gel shifts were performed as described above, except the autoradiograph was performed with the gel wet. Specific bands were excised and the DNA eluted by incubation of the crushed gel slice in 400 μl of 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 10 mmmagnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS for 16 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. Eluates were extracted once with phenol/chloroform and DNA precipitated with ethanol. Pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of formamide-loading dyes (95% formamide, 4% EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol). Radioactivity in each sample was determined using a scintillation counter and equal amounts of radioactivity loaded in each lane of a denaturing urea 10% polyacrylamide gel. The density of bands on autoradiograms was quantified by scanning the image into the program NIH Image, which calculates the band densities required in two dimensions. Intensities of bands in the unbound DNA fraction reflect the relative abundance of DNA fragments that failed to bind either one or two molecules of IRF-1. For DNA eluted from the monomeric IRF-1 complex, the usual practice of calculating the intensity of footprint by the ratio of band density from free and bound fractions of probe will therefore be inaccurate, tending to overestimate degree of protection in areas where IRF-1 in fact only contacts the probe in the dimer. Thus, quantitation of footprints was performed by calculating the ratio of band density in the bound DNA fraction compared with the same band in an equal loading of DNA eluted from a control, untreated sample (input). Figures of these gels were prepared using these scanned images transferred into MacDraw Pro and printed using the dye-sublimation technique. Molecular modeling of the contacts made by IRF-1 onto the DNA double helix was performed using the program Insite II (Biopolymer module) obtained from BioSym/MSI, San Diego, and run on an Indigo II Silicon Graphics workstation. All site-directed mutations were made using recombinant PCR (31Vallette F. Mege E. Reiss A. Adesnik M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) with the complete murine iNOS fragment spanning nucleotide −1577 to +165 as template. Common to all of the reactions was the use of primers that amplify this whole segment, which are described in Ref. 24Spink J. Cohen J. Evans T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29541-29547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar. For generation of the five insertion mutants, the internal mutagenizing primers were (TCAATATTTCACTTTCCGCACATAATGGAAAATTC) and its complement for the 5-bp insertion. The inserted sequence is shown underlined. The primers used for generation of the site B and site C mutants were (CAATATTTCACGGTCATAATGG) and its complement for the site B mutant and (CACTTTCATCCTGGAAAATTCC) and its complement for the site C mutation. The altered residues from wild type are underlined. Conditions for the PCRs were as described for the generation of labeled probes, except no radioactivity was added, and the concentration of all nucleotides was 0.1 mm. For the first round of PCR, annealing was at 50 °C for 28 cycles. The PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and one-quarter of each product was combined with the same amount of its appropriate pair and used as template in a further 12 rounds of PCR under the same conditions. Full-length mutant iNOS promoter was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. For the five-insertion mutant a 262-bpBpu1102I/NheI fragment was purified and cloned into Bpu1102I/NheI-digested vector pCAT-NOS (24Spink J. Cohen J. Evans T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29541-29547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), which contains the iNOS promoter up-stream of a CAT reporter gene. For the site B and site C mutants, an SphI/NheI fragment was used in an exactly similar fashion. All mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. For generation of mutant probes, linearized plasmid DNA from the mutant clones was used as template in the reactions as described above. The rat VSM line A7r5 was transfected exactly according to the method as described in Ref. 24Spink J. Cohen J. Evans T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29541-29547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar. CAT activity was determined using the method described in the same paper. The concentrations of cytokines used were: 10 ng ml−1 IL-1, 200 units ml−1 IFN-γ, and 25 ng ml−1TNF-α. All cytokines were of murine origin and were supplied by Genzyme or Serotec. Recombinant bacterially expressed IRF-1 fused to an oligohistidine tag was tested for its ability to bind to the cytokine-responsive element of the iNOS gene using the EMSA. A 99-bp probe was used corresponding to position −979 to −881 of the murine iNOS promoter which encompasses the predicted IRF-1 binding sites (Fig.1 A). There are three potential IRF-1 binding sites within this region which are denoted A, B, and C. The number of nucleotides matching the canonical binding sequence is shown above each site, as a fraction of the total nucleotides comprising the potential binding site. This region of the promoter is essential for cytokine induction of the iNOS gene in VSM cells (24Spink J. Cohen J. Evans T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29541-29547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Addition of increasing amounts of recombinant IRF-1 produced initially one major retarded band (Fig. 1 B, lane b). With the addition of increasing amounts of IRF-1, a second, lower mobility band became apparent (Fig. 1 B, lanes c andd). At the highest concentration of added IRF-1, the first complex formed largely disappeared, and a third and fourth band of still lower mobility were formed (Fig. 1 B, lane e). Essentially identical results were obtained after removal of the oligohistidine tag at the NH2 terminus of the recombinant protein using enterokinase (data not shown). All further experiments were performed with the oligohistidine tag attached. Protein binding to this probe was specific because bovine serum albumin or denatured IRF-1 showed no binding (data not shown). In addition, excess unlabeled probe abolished this binding; excess DNA of an unrelated sequence had no effect (data not shown). The simplest explanation of the multiple bands seen in Fig.1 B that initially a single molecule of IRF-1 binds at one site, followed by a second molecule at a separate site, and so on. It is well known that IRF-1 does not bind as a multimer to a single binding site (8Tanaka N. Kawakami T. Taniguchi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar).2 To determine the exact stoichiometry of binding (32Hope I.A. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2781-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), we repeated the EMSA with the same probe but adding a mixture of full-length recombinant IRF-1 (329 amino acids) and a COOH-terminal truncated IRF-1 mutein composed of amino acids 1–246, termed D3. Because the third and fourth most retarded species detected in Fig. 1 were only seen at the highest concentrations of added IRF-1, we decided to focus on the first two species formed with lower amounts of added IRF-1. The COOH-terminal truncation mutein of IRF-1 binds to the iNOS enhancer probe in a fashion similar to that of the full-length wild type protein (Fig. 2, lanes e–g), but with the shifted bands having a greater mobility than those produced by the wild type protein, consistent with the reduced molecular weight of the mutein. Binding with the mixture of proteins produces only one new species not seen in the binding of either molecule alone (Fig. 2, lanes h–k), which is intermediate in mobility between the slowest species produced by the wild type and truncated protein. This corresponds to a mixed dimer of the two species and demonstrates that the two main bands formed on IRF-1 binding in Fig. 1 correspond to monomer then dimer formation. To determine the exact region of the iNOS enhancer which binds IRF-1, we performed molecular footprinting analyses on the monomeric and dimeric IRF-1·DNA complexes. Gel retardation with IRF-1 was performed with the 99-bp probe utilized in Fig. 1 labeled on either the top or bottom strand. Complexes corresponding to monomeric and dimeric bound IRF-1 were subjected to footprinting analysis using three separate footprinting techniques. First, we employed the technique of hydroxyl radical"
https://openalex.org/W2005339591,"We investigated the effect of expression of constitutively active Galpha mutants on cell survival. Transfection of constitutively active Galphaq and Galpha13 in two different cell lines caused condensation of genomic DNA and nuclear fragmentation. Endonuclease cleavage of genomic DNA was followed by labeling the DNA fragments and subsequent flow cytometric analysis. The observed cellular phenotype was identical to the phenotype displayed by cells undergoing apoptosis. To distinguish between the apoptosis-inducing ability of the two Galpha-subunits, the signaling pathways involved in this cellular function were investigated. Whereas Galpha q induced apoptosis via a protein kinaseC-dependent pathway, Galpha13 caused programmed cell death through a pathway involving the activation of the small G-protein Rho. Both of the pathways leading to apoptosis were blocked by overexpression of bcl-2. In contrast to other apoptosis-inducing systems, expression of constitutively active Galphaq and Galpha13 triggered apoptosis in high serum as well as in defined medium."
https://openalex.org/W2020858130,"2-Hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase (HbpA), the first enzyme of 2-hydroxybiphenyl degradation inPseudomonas azelaica HBP1, was purified 26-fold with a yield of 8% from strain HBP1 grown on 2-hydroxybiphenyl. The enzyme was also purified from a recombinant of Escherichia coliJM109, which efficiently expressed the hbpA gene. Computer densitometry of scanned slab gels revealed a purity of over 99% for both enzyme preparations. Gel filtration, subunit cross-linking, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the enzyme was a homotetramer with a molecular mass of 256 kDa. Each subunit had a molecular mass of 60 kDa containing one molecule of noncovalently bound FAD. The monooxygenase had a pI of 6.3. It catalyzed the NADH-dependent ortho-hydroxylation of 2-hydroxybiphenyl to 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl. Molecular oxygen was the source of the additional oxygen of the product. The enzyme hydroxylated various phenols with a hydrophobic side chain adjacent to the hydroxy group. All substrates effected partial uncoupling of NADH oxidation from hydroxylation with the concomitant formation of hydrogen peroxide. 2,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl, the product of the reaction with 2-hydroxybiphenyl, was a non-substrate effector that strongly facilitated NADH oxidation and hydrogen peroxide formation without being hydroxylated and also was an inhibitor. The apparentK m values (30 °C, pH 7.5) were 2.8 μm for 2-hydroxybiphenyl, 26.8 μm for NADH, and 29.2 μm for oxygen. The enzyme was inactivated byp-hydroxymercuribenzoate, a cysteine-blocking reagent. In the presence of 2-hydroxybiphenyl, the enzyme was partly protected against the inactivation, which was reversed by the addition of an excess of dithiothreitol. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme contained the consensus sequence GXGXXG, indicative of the βαβ-fold of the flavin binding site and shared homologies with that of phenol 2-hydroxylase from Pseudomonas strain EST1001 as well as with that of 2,4-dichlorophenol 6-hydroxylase from Ralstonia eutropha. 2-Hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase (HbpA), the first enzyme of 2-hydroxybiphenyl degradation inPseudomonas azelaica HBP1, was purified 26-fold with a yield of 8% from strain HBP1 grown on 2-hydroxybiphenyl.

Siegel M.R. Sisler H.D. Antifungal Compounds. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1977: 269-352Google Scholar). The concern about its persistence in the environment was the driving force for studies aimed at elucidating its bacterial metabolism. Growing on 2-hydroxybiphenyl as the sole carbon and energy source,Pseudomonas azelaica HBP1 employs a meta-cleavage pathway with a broad substrate spectrum for breaking down 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2Kohler H.P.E. Kohler-Staub D. Focht D.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 2683-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation of 2,2′-dihydroxybiphenyl, which is also a growth substrate, occurs accordingly (3Kohler H.P.E. Schmid A. van der Maarel M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first reaction of the pathway, the ortho-hydroxylation of 2-hydroxy- and 2,2′-dihydroxybiphenyl to 2,3-dihydroxy- and 2,2′,3-trihydroxybiphenyl, respectively, is catalyzed by the NADH-dependent 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3monooxygenase (EC 1.14.13.44). 2,3-Dihydroxy- and 2,2′,3-trihydroxybiphenyl are further degraded to benzoate and salicylate via the meta-cleavage products 2-hydroxy-6-phenyl-6-oxo-2,4-hexadienoic acid and 2-hydroxy-6-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-6-oxo-2,4-hexadienoic acid, respectively (2Kohler H.P.E.

In rats, 2-hydroxybiphenyl shows renal toxicity and causes tumors of the urinary bladder (11Nakagawa Y. Moore G.A. Life Sci. 1995; 57: 1433-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The microsomal monooxygenase system hydroxylates 2-hydroxybiphenyl to 2,5-dihydroxybiphenyl (phenylhydroquinone) (12Nakagawa Y. Tayama S. Xenobiotika. 1989; 19: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanisms of the toxic and carcinogenic effects in rats are still unclear, it is speculated that reactive oxygenation products of 2,5-dihydroxybiphenyl (phenylbenzoquinone and phenylsemiquinone) ultimately cause these effects (13Tayama S. Nakagawa Y. Mutat. Res. 1994; 324: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently, the microbial degradation of 2-hydroxy- and 2,2′-dihydroxybiphenyl has become important to researchers involved in the desulfurization of coal and petroleum, since it was reported that 2-hydroxy- and 2,2′-dihydroxybiphenyl are the end products of the bacterial desulfurization of dibenzothiophene, a major sulfur-containing component of fossil fuels (14Omori T.

Bioeng. 1996; 81: 121-124Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Previously, we partly purified the 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase for producing metabolites necessary for elucidating the degradation pathway of 2,2′-dihydroxybiphenyl in P. azelaica HBP1 (3Kohler H.P.E. Schmid A. van der Maarel M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now report on the purification and characterization of the enzyme. 2-Hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase is a novel flavin-containing, NADH-dependent aromatic hydroxylase with a broad substrate spectrum. Its relationship to other members of the group of phenolic hydroxylases is discussed. P. azelaica HBP1 was cultured on 2-hydroxybiphenyl as described previously (2Kohler H.P.E. Kohler-Staub D. Focht D.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 2683-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks on a rotary shaker (150–170 rpm) at 30 °C. The purity of the cultures was regularly tested by streaking them out on mineral salts medium plates that were prepared by adding 2-hydroxybiphenyl as a concentrated methanolic solution to the hot mineral medium containing 15 g/liter agar. Recombinants of Escherichia coli JM109 were cultivated in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For the purpose of protein purification, large amounts of cells were produced in aerated 20-liter carboys equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. Cells were harvested in the late exponential growth phase (with anA 546 of about 1.5) by centrifugation (15 min at 6,000 × g) at 4 °C. The culture fluid was passed through a paper filter before centrifugation to remove remaining 2-hydroxybiphenyl crystals. Cells were washed twice with an excess amount of triethanolamine-HCl buffer (10 mm, pH 7.5). Approximately 20 g of cell paste (wet weight) was obtained from one 20-liter batch. The cell paste was stored at −20 °C until further use. 2,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl was obtained from Wako Chemicals GmbH (Neuss, Germany). 2,5-Dihydroxybiphenyl, 2-propylphenol, 2-ethylphenol, and 2-sec-butylphenol were purchased from Aldrich-Chemie (Steinheim, Germany). 2-sec-Butylcatechol was prepared by the enzymatic conversion of 2-sec-butylphenol with 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase and by subsequent purification of the product by means of a preparative HPLC apparatus.18O2 was obtained from Eurisotop, Center d'Etudes de Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France. If not otherwise indicated, all other chemicals used were bought from Fluka Chemie AG (Buchs, Switzerland). The enzyme purification apparatus was located in a laboratory at room temperature, but the buffer reservoirs and the sample collector vials were kept on ice. The flow rate was 1 ml min−1 for all chromatography steps, and the volume of the collected fractions was always 1 ml if not stated otherwise. Ten grams of cell paste was suspended in 50 ml of triethanolamine-HCl buffer (10 mm, pH 7.5). Crude cell extract was prepared by passing the cells through a French pressure cell (two passages at 20,000 p.s.i.) followed by ultracentrifugation (30 min at 50,000 × g) at 4 °C. Crude cell extract was freed from DNA and basic proteins by slowly adding a 2% (w/v) protamine sulfate solution until a final concentration of 0.05 mg of protamine sulfate/mg of protein was reached. After stirring for 30 min at 4 °C, the precipitated biopolymers were removed by centrifugation (30 min, 50,000 × g, 4 °C). The supernatant of the above purification step was directly loaded onto an anion exchange column (1 × 15 cm; Fractogel EMD TMAE-650; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) equilibrated with 10 mm triethanolamine-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Elution was carried out with an increasing NaCl gradient in 10 mm triethanolamine-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). 2-Hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase eluted at an NaCl concentration of 0.3 m. Active fractions from the protamine sulfate treatment step were pooled, supplemented with (NH4)2SO4 to a final concentration of 0.9 m, and loaded onto a Fractogel TSK Butyl 650 S (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) column (1 × 15 cm) equilibrated with 0.75 m(NH4)2SO4 in 100 mmNa2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.0). The column was washed with 2–3 volumes of the equilibration buffer, and the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient from 0.75 to 0 m(NH4)2SO4. The fractions containing the enzyme were desalted on Sephadex G-25 M columns (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The desalted enzyme solution was supplemented with FAD to a final concentration of 0.3 mm and loaded onto an anion exchange column (Fractogel EMD TMAE-650) equilibrated with 10 mm triethanolamine-HCl buffer (pH 8.2). Isocratic conditions (0.3 m NaCl) were used to elute the 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase. The fractions containing active enzyme from the preceding step were incubated with 0.3 mm FAD for 30 min on ice. The solution was passed with a flow rate of 1.5 ml min−1 through a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (1.6 × 60 cm; Pharmacia) equilibrated with 50 mmNa2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.5). Pooled fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration with Centricon concentrators (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). The concentrated solution of the purified enzyme (3–5 mg of protein/ml) was stored at −20 °C until further use. Activity of the 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase was measured either spectrophotometrically or polarographically as described previously (2Kohler H.P.E. Kohler-Staub D. Focht D.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 2683-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All measurements were done at 30 °C. The oxygen consumption rates were calculated based on saturation constants of oxygen in water (7.53 mg/liter at 30 °C and at atmospheric pressure (1.013 105 pascals). The investigation of the pH dependence was done with the following buffers of constant ionic strength (I = 20 mm): 20 mmMES, 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis;pHMB, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate., pH 6–6.75; 20 mmNa2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 6.75–7.75; 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.75–8.5. The disappearance of substrates and the formation of metabolites were monitored by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Protein was removed from the samples (3 ml) by the addition of 20 μl of 8.5% H3PO4 and subsequent centrifugation. The samples were analyzed by injecting 20 μl onto a computer-controlled Gynkotek high performance liquid chromatograph consisting of a Gina 50 automated injection module, a M480 G gradient pump, an on-line degasser, and an UVD 340 S photodiode array detector (Gynkotek, Germering, Germany). Reverse-phase separation was achieved on a Waters Nova-Pak C-18 column (Waters-Millipore, Milford, MA) by applying a linear gradient of 60–70% B (A, 10 mmH3PO4; B, 90% methanol, 10% 10 mmH3PO4) with a flow rate of 0.6 ml min−1. The flavin cofactor was extracted from the protein by treating a 400-μl sample of 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase (2.6 mg ml−1) in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) with 100 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid for 5 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. HPLC analysis (isocratic conditions with an eluent consisting of 40% methanol and 60% 10 mm H3PO4 (v/v)) of the supernatant allowed the identification of the cofactor by comparison of the retention times and the UV-VIS spectra to authentic FAD (retention time, 10.3 min) and FMN (retention time, 14.4 min). The protein contents of the cell extracts and the purified protein fractions were measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, München, Germany). Bovine serum albumin in the concentration range from 2 to 20 μg ml−1 was used as a standard. Incorporation of 18O2 into the products of the enzyme reaction was measured to confirm the monooxygenation reaction. The experiments were carried out in two 13.8-ml serum flasks, which contained 1 ml of the enzyme incubation mixture consisting of 30 milliunits of 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase, 0.3 mmNADH, and 10 mm triethanolamine-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Both flasks were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers. A 50:50 mixture of18O2 to 16O2 in one of the flasks was obtained by injecting 2.6 ml of18O2 into the head space (12.8 ml). The other flask contained 16O2 from air. The enzyme reaction was started by injecting 15 μl of a methanolic solution of 2-hydroxybiphenyl (0.1 mm) through the rubber seals. After 15 min, the incubation mixtures were acidified with 5 μl of H3PO4 (8.5%) to a final pH of 2 and subsequently centrifuged to remove the precipitated protein. The metabolites were extracted from the supernatants with an equal volume of ethyl acetate and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. Samples were derivatized withN,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis as described before (3Kohler H.P.E. Schmid A. van der Maarel M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) was performed in slab gels (100 × 60 × 0.75 mm) with the separating gels containing 12.5% acrylamide. The following proteins were used as standards (Pharmacia): phosphorylase b (94 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 and destained with a solution of 30% (v/v) methanol and 1.5% (v/v) acetic acid in deionized water. Silver staining of SDS gels was performed according to a standard method (20Copeland R.A. Methods for Protein Analysis: A Practical Guide to Laboratory Protocols. Chapman and Hall, New York1994: 59-98Crossref Google Scholar). The gels were scanned and analyzed with a computing densitometer system (ImageQuant™, Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Isoelectric focusing gels contained 7.5% acrylamide and a broad pH range ampholyte (Resolyte 3.5–10, BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole, United Kingdom). Isoelectric focusing was performed in the same apparatus that was used for SDS-PAGE (20Copeland R.A. Methods for Protein Analysis: A Practical Guide to Laboratory Protocols. Chapman and Hall, New York1994: 59-98Crossref Google Scholar). The pH gradient was formed by filling the upper buffer chamber with catholyte solution (20 mm sodium hydroxide) and the lower buffer chamber with anolyte solution (10 mm phosphoric acid). Five micrograms of protein was loaded onto the isoelectric focusing gel, and the pI was estimated from the position of the protein band relative to the position of the bands of the marker proteins (broad pI calibration kit, 3.5–10; Pharmacia). The molecular mass of the pure enzyme was determined under native conditions by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (1.6 × 60 cm, Pharmacia) equilibrated with 20 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The column was calibrated with blue dextran 2000 and the following reference proteins (Pharmacia): thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). Covalent cross-linking of enzyme subunits was carried out by the method of Griffith (21Griffith I.P. Biochem. J. 1972; 126: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with glutaraldehyde as the reactive agent. Ten microliters of glutaraldehyde (0.5%, w/v) was added to 250 μl (0.5 mg ml−1) enzyme solution and incubated for 12 h at room temperature. The treated protein sample was denatured with SDS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was determined by automated Edman degradation. The specific activity of purified 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase and of partly purified enzyme fractions was routinely measured in an spectrophotometric assay with NADH and was defined as the amount of NADH (μmol) that the enzyme oxidized in the presence of 2-hydroxybiphenyl/min/mg of protein. The reaction was started by the addition of the substrate. The substrate-specific oxidation rates were corrected for nonspecific NADH oxidation in the absence of substrate (endogenous rate). The kinetic parameters V maxand K m were calculated with a computer program (IGOR Pro; WaveMetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). The calculation was based on weighted nonlinear regression analysis of the Michaelis-Menten model. We confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations that the least square estimators of the paramaters were close to being normally distributed and that the model was close to linear (22Wilkinson G.N. Biochem. J. 1961; 80: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2724) Google Scholar, 23Ratkowsky D.A. Nonlinear Regression Modeling: A Unified Practical Approach. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1983Google Scholar). 2-Hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase (4–4.5 μm, in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) was incubated with various concentrations of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate at 25 °C. Aliquots of 10 μl were withdrawn from the incubation mixtures, immediately diluted in 990 μl of phosphate buffer, and assayed for enzyme activity. Reactivation of the mercurated enzyme was followed after the addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol. 2-Hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase (HbpA) from cells of P. azelaica strain HBP1 grown on 2-hydroxybiphenyl as the only carbon and energy source was purified 26-fold with a yield of 8% (Table I). The enzyme was brightly yellow and accounted for about 4% of the total cell protein in the crude cell extract. Protein samples from the final step of the purification were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The enzyme migrated as a single band. Computer densitometry of scanned slab gels revealed a purity of over 99% (Fig. 1 A). To detect minor contaminating proteins in the sample, separate gels were stained with silver. No additional protein bands could be detected by silver staining.Table IPurification of 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase from P. azelaica HBP1Total volumeTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityRecoveryPurification factormlmgunitsunits mg −1%-foldCrude extract557451150.15100Protamine sulfate treatment49452980.2285.21.47Anion exchange (pH 7.5)13176850.4873.93.2Hydrophobic interaction3.618372.0632.213.7Anion exchange (pH 8.2)2.43.1113.559.5723.7Gel filtration0.62.329.13.927.9126.1 Open table in a new tab 2-Hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase was also purified from cells of the recombinant E. coli JM109 [pIV61] containing the gene (hbpA) for the 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase (24Schmid, A. (1997) Der Metabolismus von ortho-Hydroxybiphenylen in Pseudomonas azelaica HBP 1, Ph.D. thesis, University of StuttgartGoogle Scholar) by means of the method established for the wild type enzyme (Fig.1 B). At a temperature of 4 °C, the activity of the purified enzyme remained constant for at least 12 h, and after 24 h approximately 90% of the activity was still present. The pure enzyme was stored at a concentration of 3.8 mg/ml in 50 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at −20 °C. Under these conditions, it retained full activity for at least 6 months. The relative molecular mass of the pure enzyme under native conditions was determined to be 256 kDa by gel filtration. SDS-PAGE of the purified monooxygenase gave a single band with an estimated molecular weight of 60 kDa, suggesting a tetrameric quatenary structure of the enzyme. The subunits of the enzyme were covalently cross-linked with glutaraldehyde. SDS treatment of such a preparation and subsequent separation of its components by SDS-PAGE led to the appearance of three bands with estimated molecular masses of 259, 138, and 64 kDa (not shown). It is assumed that the bands reflect the tetrameric, dimeric, and monomeric forms of the enzyme. A protein band corresponding to a trimeric form was not found. The pI was determined to be at pH 6.3 ± 0.7 (95% confidence interval) by isoelectric focusing as described under “Material and Methods.” The enzyme activity in the pooled fractions of the hydrophobic interaction chromatography step was increased by 30% when 10 μm FAD was present in the assay. The addition of FMN to the assay mixture had no effect on the enzyme activity. These results suggested that FAD might be the prosthetic group of the monooxygenase. To isolate the cofactor, samples of the purified enzyme were treated with 5% trichloroacetic acid. HPLC analysis confirmed that the cofactor of the monooxygenase was indeed FAD, since the extracted compound co-chromatographed with authentic FAD and also had an identical UV-VIS spectrum (diode array detection). An enzyme preparation from the final purification step (gel filtration) was taken for spectroscopic analysis. The enzyme sample was judged to be free of unbound FAD, since the specific activity did not decrease after gel filtration and the addition of FAD to the eluted enzyme did not further stimulate activity. The UV-vis spectrum of the purified 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase showed maxima at 382 and 452 nm and a minimum at 410 nm. This is characteristic of a flavoprotein (Fig.2). The ratio of the absorbance at 250 nm relative to that at 450 nm was 6.2. Above 320 nm, the spectrum closely resembled that of authentic FAD except that the ratio of the absorbance at 375 nm to the one at 450 nm was 0.92 for the enzyme as compared with 0.82 for free FAD. The absorption at 450 nm of an enzyme solution with a protein content of 2.3 mg ml−1 (8.9 μm) was 0.37 (Fig. 2). On the basis of a molar absorption coefficient (ε450) of 11,300 m−1cm−1 for the FAD moiety (25Beinert H. Boyer P.D. Lardy H. Myrbäck K. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1960: 339-416Google Scholar), it was estimated that 1 mol of enzyme contained 3.7 mol of FAD. To confirm the monooxygenation reaction for the formation of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl from 2-hydroxybiphenyl by 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase, the enzymatic reaction was carried out in the presence of18O2. The reaction products were isolated, derivatized, and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Fig.3 shows the mass spectra of the TMS derivatives of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl from the incubation with16O2 (A) and with a 1:1 mixture of16O2 to 18O2(B). The fragmentation patterns of the two spectra clearly show that one atom of dioxygen was incorporated into 2-hydroxybiphenyl during the course of the reaction. The effect of temperature on the activity of the 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase was investigated over the range of 10–50 °C. The temperature optimum of the enzymatic reaction was at 33 °C. The monooxygenase retained more than 70% of its activity in the temperature range from 27 to 40 °C. Above 50 °C, enzymatic activity was completely absent. The monooxygenase maintained more than 80% of its activity in the pH range between pH 7.2 and 7.8 and showed a maximum activity at pH 7.5. Beyond pH 7.8, the activity of the 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase declined abruptly with increasing pH. Incubation of 2-hydroxybiphenyl with the purified 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase led to the formation of a reaction product that was isolated and identified as 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The substrate specificity of the 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase was investigated with a variety of ortho-substituted phenols. TableII shows initial velocities of substrate conversions determined by independent measurements of NADH oxidation, oxygen consumption, and substrate disappearance at 30 °C and pH 7.2. It is evident that for all substrates the stoichiometric coefficients for NADH oxidation (or oxygen consumption) and hydroxylation were not equal. This indicates that the substrates partially uncoupled oxygen activation from hydroxylation with the resultant reduction of both atoms of oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide. The formation of hydrogen peroxide was shown by the addition of catalase at the end of the oxygen uptake experiments. For 2-hydroxybiphenyl as the substrate, 15% of the consumed oxygen was recovered after the addition of catalase, which means that according to the stoichiometry of the catalase reaction 30% of the consumed oxygen was diverted to hydrogen peroxide. With 2-sec-butylphenol, which was more rapidly metabolized than 2-hydroxybiphenyl, 47% of the consumed oxygen was released as hydrogen peroxide. The uncoupling determined by the catalase-dependent oxygen production exceeded the uncoupling determined by the measurement of initial reaction velocities. Subsequent experiments showed that the product of the hydroxylation of 2-hydroxybiphenyl, 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl was a strong effector of 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase and stimulated stoichiometric NADH and oxygen consumption without undergoing hydroxylation. This explained the elevated amounts of hydrogen peroxide observed after the complete conversion of 2-hydroxybiphenyl.Table IIAssay substrateSpecific monooxygenase activityPercentage of uncoupling2-aThe proportion of uncoupling of hydroxylation with the different substrates was calculated as the deviation of the apparent oxygen consumption from the assumed 1:1 stoichiometry with respect to substrate conversion.NADH oxidationOxygen uptakeSubstr"

To date, 11 different PKC isoenzymes have been identified that are divided into three different subgroups, conventional PKCs (cPKCs), novel PKCs (nPKCs), and atypical PKCs (1Newton A.C. J. Biol.

Overexpression of wild type of PKC-δ (PKC-δWT) in 32D myeloid progenitor cells led to monocytic differentiation in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment (5Mischak H.

PKC-δ was also demonstrated to be an important substrate in the platelet-derived growth factor β receptor (PDGF-βR) pathway (13Li W. Yu J.-C. Michieli P. Beeler J.F. Ellmore N.

The relevance of PKC-δ in mediating c-sis/PDGF-B transformation of NIH 3T3 cells was recently elucidated (14Li W. Michieli P. Alimandi M. Lorenzi M.V. Wu Y. Wang L.-H. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 731-737PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, expression of the PKC-δK376R mutant led to dramatic inhibition of c-sis-induced NIH 3T3 cell transformation. These results demonstrate that PKC-δ plays a physiological role in a signaling pathway leading to malignant transformation of fibroblasts induced by sis oncogene. Serine/threonine phosphorylation of PKC in vivo was first observed approximately 10 years ago (15Borner C. Filipuzzi I. Wartmann M. Eppenberger U. Fabbro D. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of PKC on the “activation loop,” which corresponds to threonines 497 and 500 of PKC-α (23Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1114-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and βII (26Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, by an unidentified PKC kinase then renders PKC catalytic domain competent. However, transphosphorylation of PKC on its activation loop does not alter the mobility of the protein as observed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Subsequent autophosphorylation on threonine 641 of PKC-βII results in the first upward shift of the mobility of the protein. This event is followed by a second autophosphorylation on serine 660 of PKC-βII which further shifts the protein to the mature 80-kDa form. Generation of diacylglycerol through different mechanisms recruits PKC to the membrane where the pseudosubstrate region-mediated autoinhibition of the catalytic domain is released. The enzyme is then able to phosphorylate substrates and transmit the downstream signals. How the mature enzyme returns to the cytosol after activation remains unclear. This may be regulated by serine/threonine phosphatase activity (1Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of PKC has been observed both in vivoand in vitro (15Borner C. Filipuzzi I. Wartmann M. Eppenberger U. Fabbro D. J. Biol.

It is thought that autophosphorylation of PKC enhances its binding to phorbol ester and reduces the K m for its substrates in vitro (16Huang K.-P. Chan K.-F.J. Singh T.J. Nakabayashi H. Huang F.L. J.

Several in vivo autophosphorylation sites for different PKC isoenzymes have been mapped (20Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr.

Recently, conserved threonine autophosphorylation sites on two cPKCs (PKC-α and PKC-βI) were characterized by site-directed mutagenesis (23Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1114-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 28Zhang J. Wang L. Petrin J. Bishop W.R. Bond R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of threonine 638 to alanine in the PKC-α molecule did not dramatically affect its enzymatic activity (23Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1114-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In striking contrast, mutation of this conserved site (threonine 642 to alanine) in PKC-βI completely abolished its enzymatic activity and in vivophosphorylation (29Zhang J. Wang L. Schwartz J. Bond R.W. Bishop W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since PKC-δ belongs to the nPKC subfamily and a serine residue rather than a threonine residue exists at this conserved position (see Fig. 1), we have attempted to elucidate whether PKC-δ is phosphorylated on this conserved site and, if so, whether this phosphorylation would influence PKC-δ function. Our results indicate that serine 643 is a major PKC-δ autophosphorylation site, and phosphorylation of this site significantly affects its enzymatic activity. The Bio-Rad Muta-gene Phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit (version 2) was used for the site-directed mutagenesis. The oligonucleotide 5′-GAATGAGAAACCTCAGCTTGCATTCAG-3′ was used as a mutant primer in the in vitro mutagenesis reaction where the serine residue at amino acid 643 of murine PKC-δ was changed to alanine (underlined in the sequence). The successful mutation of this site generated a new BsmI restriction site that was used to screen all the reaction products. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The PKC-δS643A mutant cDNA was subcloned into pCEV-HA (three hemagglutinin epitope repeats, neo selection) and pLTR (two HA epitope repeats, gpt selection) vectors, generating pCEV-δS643A-HA and pLTR-δS643A-HA, respectively. The generation of these two vectors and subcloning of PKC-δWT cDNA into these vectors have been previously described (6Li W. Yu J.-C. Shin D.-Y. Pierce J.H. J. Biol.

The 32D cells were transfected with different cDNA expression vectors using the electroporation procedure described previously (5Mischak H. Pierce J.H. Goodnight J. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20110-20115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 32D cells and transfectants were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 5% WEHI-3B conditioned medium as a source of murine interleukin-3. These procedures have been described previously (6Li W. Yu J.-C. Shin D.-Y. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8311-8318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,10Li W.

Briefly, the 32D transfectants were serum-starved for 2 h and left untreated or stimulated with 100 ng/ml TPA (Sigma) for 10 min. The cell pellets were lysed in Triton X-100 containing lysis buffer (13Li W. Yu J.-C. Michieli P. Beeler J.F. Ellmore N. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6727-6735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and clarified by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitation, equal amounts of proteins (1–5 mg per sample) were incubated with polyclonal anti-PKC-δ serum (5 μl per sample, Calbiochem) together with 40 μl of protein G-coupled Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) or with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (mAb; 4 μg per sample, Boehringer Mannheim) together with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Pierce). Anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P), 2 μg/ml, Upstate Biotechnology) and anti-PKC-δ (1:1000) were utilized for immunoblot analysis. The enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.) was used to visualize proteins, and the densities of the bands from SDS-PAGE and autoradiography were quantified by using a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). The method for the subcellular fractionation has been described before (6Li W. Yu J.-C. Shin D.-Y. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8311-8318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Li W. Yu J.-C. Michieli P. Beeler J.F. Ellmore N. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Mol. Cell.

The in vitro autophosphorylation assay utilizing anti-HA antibody for immunoprecipitation was performed by following a previously described protocol (6Li W. Yu J.-C. Shin D.-Y. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8311-8318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody as described above. Washed immunoprecipitates were incubated on ice for 30 min with 50 μl of autophosphorylation buffer that contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmmagnesium acetate, 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine (Sigma), 100 ng/ml TPA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μm ATP (Boehringer Mannheim), and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.). The reaction was stopped by washing twice with Triton X-100 containing lysis buffer, and denatured proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The dried gel was autoradiographed. Both in vivo labeling and subsequent two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis have been described previously (30Li W. Li W. Chen X.-H. Kelley C.A. Alimandi M. Zhang J. Chen Q. Bottaro D.P. Pierce J.H.

Briefly, serum-starved 32D transfectants were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/ml; NEN Life Science Products) for 3 h and were stimulated with TPA (100 ng/ml) for 10 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mAb, and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled PKC-δWT-HA and PKC-δS643A-HA bands were excised from the gel and exhaustively digested with trypsin (tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated). The resulting phosphopeptides were resolved by thin layer electrophoresis, pH 8.9, followed by ascending chromatography, pH 1.9. Dried plates were autoradiographed for 1 week. DE52 ion exchange chromatography to enrich PKC from the cell lysates and the subsequent measurement of PKC activity utilizing PKC-δ pseudosubstrate region-derived peptide as a substrate have been described previously (6Li W. Yu J.-C. Shin D.-Y. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8311-8318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Li W. Yu J.-C. Michieli P. Beeler J.F. Ellmore N.

Direct measurement of PKC-δ activity on PKC-δ substrate utilizing anti-HA immunoprecipitates as the kinase sources was also employed. Briefly, the equal amounts of protein (6 mg per sample) from the various PKC-δ transfectants were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody (4 μg per sample). Washed immunoprecipitates were incubated at room temperature with 40 μl of reaction buffer that contained 10 μm PKC-δ substrate derived from PKC-δ pseudosubstrate region (6Li W. Yu J.-C. Shin D.-Y. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8311-8318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 μm magnesium acetate, 1 μm TPA, 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine (Sigma), 30 μm ATP, and 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min. The reaction tube was centrifuged, and 20 μl of the supernatant was spotted on phosphocellulase disk sheets (Life Technologies, Inc.). The sheets were washed twice with 1% phosphoric acid and twice with distilled water, and samples were analyzed by liquid scintillation. The nonspecific catalytic activity was measured in the same reaction buffer except that TPA and phosphatidylserine were omitted from the reaction. The specific PKC-δ activity was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific catalytic activity from the total catalytic activity and expressed as counts per min (cpm). 32D cells or 32D transfectants were untreated or exposed to TPA (100 ng/ml) overnight. Cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-Mac-1 (CalTag) or anti-FcγII/III receptor (anti-FcγII/IIIR, Pharmigen) as described previously (6Li W. Yu J.-C. Shin D.-Y.

In an attempt to define which amino acids within PKC-δ are autophosphorylation sites and determine whether mutation of one of these sites would affect PKC-δ enzymatic activity, we chose to mutate serine 643 to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. This putative autophosphorylation site is conserved in other PKC sequences, including PKC-α, PKC-βI, and PKC-βII (Fig.1). In vivo phosphopeptide mapping or site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding threonine sites within PKC-α, PKC-βI, and PKC-βII revealed that these residues were all phosphorylated in vivo (20Keranen L.M.

The mutant cDNA, designated PKC-δS643A, was inserted into the pCEV-HA (3 × HA repeats) vector, generating pCEV-δS643A-HA, or into pLTR-HA vector (2 × HA repeats), generating pLTR-δS643A-HA. PKC-δWT cDNA was previously inserted into these same vectors and designated pCEV-δWT-HA and pLTR-δWT-HA, respectively (30Li W. Li W. Chen X.-H. Kelley C.A. Alimandi M. Zhang J. Chen Q. Bottaro D.P. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26404-26409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 32D cells were transfected with expression vectors containing the various cDNA constructs, and drug-resistant 32D transfectants were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis to detect PKC-δS643A and PKC-δWT expression. As shown in Fig.2, immunoprecipitation with anti-PKC-δ serum followed by immunoblot analysis with the anti-HA mAb detected both pLTR-δWT-HA and pCEV-δWT-HA proteins with mobilities of 80 and 90 kDa, respectively. The mobilities of PKC-δWT proteins expressed in these two vectors were identical to those reported in our previous study (30Li W. Li W. Chen X.-H. Kelley C.A. Alimandi M. Zhang J. Chen Q. Bottaro D.P. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26404-26409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Endogenous PKC-δ expression in 32D cells was not detected, since the anti-HA mAb was utilized for immunoprecipitation. The levels of PKC-δS643A expression in cells transfected with pLTR-HA and pCEV-HA vectors were 2.8- and 1.8-fold higher than those of PKC-δWT in the corresponding vectors, respectively (Fig. 2). We performed in vitroautophosphorylation assays utilizing the anti-HA mAb for immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig.3 A, autophosphorylation of pLTR-δS643A-HA protein was reduced by 54% when compared with that of the pLTR-δWT-HA molecule. Autophosphorylation of the pCEV-δS643A-HA protein was decreased by 37% when compared with that of pCEV-δWT-HA (Fig. 3 B). Autophosphorylation of endogenous PKC-δ from parental 32D cells was not detected since the anti-HA mAb would not recognize endogenous PKC-δ. By normalizing protein expression levels of PKC-δS643A in comparison to those of PKC-δWT in the various transfectants (see Fig. 2), an 83% reduction in pLTR-δS643A-HA autophosphorylation and a 65% reduction in pCEV-δS643A-HA autophosphorylation were observed. These results strongly suggest that serine 643 of PKC-δ is a major autophosphorylation site, and mutation of this site dramatically reduces autophosphorylation. To confirm that serine 643 is an in vivo phosphorylation site, two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 4 A, tryptic digestion of in vivo labeled PKC-δWT-HA from the TPA-treated transfectant resulted in the detection of approximately 20 distinct phosphopeptides. The phosphopeptide pattern generated from PKC-δWT-HA is consistent to that generated in a previous study (30Li W. Li W. Chen X.-H. Kelley C.A. Alimandi M. Zhang J. Chen Q. Bottaro D.P. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26404-26409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), assuring that this assay is very reproducible. Although most of PKC-δWT-HA phosphopeptides were also detected from tryptic digestion of in vivo labeled PKC-δS643A-HA after TPA treatment of 32D/pLTR-δS643A-HA transfectant, two phosphopeptides (peptides 5 and 14) were absent from PKC-δS643A-HA sample. The reduced intensity of peptide 5 in a mixture experiment, where equal amounts of PKC-δWT-HA and PKC-δS643A-HA samples were mixed before performing two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis, confirmed that peptide 5 was missing in PKC-δS643A-HA (compare peptide 5 in Fig. 4, Aand C). Since the PKC-δWT-HA sample migrated slightly slower than the others in chromatography, only a tail of peptide 14 can be observed (Fig. 4 A). This peptide was not detected in PKC-δS643A-HA sample (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, whether the intensity of peptide 14 detected in the mixture experiment was reduced (Fig. 4 C) is difficult to judge. In addition, the intensity of peptide 11 was greatly reduced in the PKC-δS643A-HA sample when compared with PKC-δWT-HA, and intermediate intensity was observed in the mixture experiment (Fig. 4 C). On the other hand, phosphopeptide 19 may be absent in PKC-δWT-HA. Taken together, the results of two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis clearly indicate that the absence or reduction in intensity of phosphopeptides 5, 14, and 11 may account for the reduced autophosphorylation of PKC-δS643Ain vitro (see Fig. 3). The enzymatic activity of PKC-δS643A expressed in pLTR-HA system was measured utilizing two separate procedures. In the first assay, the activities were measured utilizing anti-HA immunoprecipitates as the kinase sources. This method has been recently used in other PKC studies to measure PKC activity (8Denning M.F. Dlugosz A. Threadgill D.W. Magnuson T. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol.

As shown in Table I, the immunoprecipitates derived from pLTR-δWT-HA and pLTR-δS643A-HA mutant transfectants displayed similar nonspecific catalytic activities when they were incubated with the PKC-δ pseudosubstrate region-derived peptide in the absence of TPA and phosphatidylserine, two important cofactors required for specific PKC activation in vitro. However, the specific PKC-δ catalytic activity of pLTR-δS643A-HA mutant was reduced by 54% when compared with that of pLTR-δWT-HA protein.Table IThe PKC-δS643A mutant protein expressed in 32D cells possesses reduced enzymatic activity as measured by utilizing anti-HA immunoprecipitates as PKC-δ kinase sourcesCell linesTotal catalytic activityNonspecific activityPKC-δ activity32D/pLTR-δWT-HA1,401,383246,7421,154,64132D/pLTR-δS643A-HA747,810214,401533,409 (54%)1-aThe % inhibition of enzymatic activity was determined by subtracting the PKC-δ activity of the pLTR-δS643A-HA transfectant from the pLTR-δWT-HA transfectant and dividing the difference by the activity of the pLTR-δWT-HA transfectant.The method for measuring PKC-δ activity by using anti-HA immunoprecipitates as PKC-δ sources was described under “Experimental Procedures.” Only one sample from each lysate was utilized for anti-HA immunoprecipitation and the subsequent activity assay.

The increased activity observed in the pLTR-δWT-HA transfectant correlated with the levels of overexpressed PKC-δ protein (data not shown). Expression of pLTR-δS643A-HA reduced its specific catalytic activity by 39% compared with that of pLTR-δWT-HA. By normalizing the protein expression level of pLTR-δS643A-HA in comparison to that of pLTR-δWT-HA, a 78–84% reduction in pLTR-δS643A-HA enzymatic activity was calculated from the results of these two assays (see Fig.2). In summary, these results indicate that PKC-δ serine 643 is not only important for autophosphorylation but also for transphosphorylation of its in vitro substrate.Table IIThe PKC-δS643A mutant protein expressed in 32D cells possesses reduced enzymatic activity as measured by utilizing DE52 column eluates as PKC-δ kinase sourcesEluates of DE52 columnTotal catalytic activityNonspecific activityPKC-δ activity32D14,060 ± 5036,438 ± 432 7,62232D/pLTR-δWT-HA130,123 ± 8,32620,051 ± 264110,07232D/pLTR-δS643A-HA79,106 ± 2,78611,708 ± 332 67,398 (39%)2-aThe % inhibition of enzymatic activity was determined by subtracting the PKC-δ activity of the pLTR-δS643A-HA transfectant from the pLTR-δWT-HA transfectant and dividing the difference by the activity of the pLTR-δWT-HA transfectant.The method for PKC enrichment by DE52 ion exchange chromatography and the subsequent activity assay has been described previously (6Li W.

PKC-δ specific activity was obtained by subtracting nonspecific activity from total catalytic activity. The results represent the mean value of three individual samples. The activity is presented as cpm. Recent work on the PKC-αT638A mutant suggested that mutation of threonine 638 rendered the enzyme very sensitive to heat treatment (23Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1114-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, we were interested in determining whether there were any changes in the heat sensitivity of PKC-δS643A mutant in comparison to PKC-δWT. As shown in Fig. 5, pLTR-δWT-HA, pLTR-δS643A-HA, and endogenous PKC activities remained very stable even after a 30-min period of preincubation at 25 °C. Surprisingly, both pLTR-δWT-HA and pLTR-δS643A-HA mutant activities were slightly increased after the preincubation period. This result suggests that phosphorylation of PKC-δ on serine 643 does not affect the heat stability of the enzyme, even though the enzymatic activity and autophosphorylation of PKC-δS643A are greatly reduced in comparison to PKC-δWT. PKC-δ normally resides in the cytosol (S100) of the cell. In response to stimulation by TPA, a portion translocates to the membrane fraction (P100) (13Li W. Yu J.-C. Michieli P. Beeler J.F. Ellmore N. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6727-6735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous data demonstrated that PKC-δ was tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo in response to TPA stimulation, and tyrosine-phosphorylated PKC-δ could be detected only in the membrane fraction (6Li W.

Thus, we investigated whether mutation of serine 643 would affect localization, translocation, or tyrosine phosphorylation of the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the pLTR-δS643A-HA mutant as well as pLTR-δWT-HA proteins resided in the cytosol in resting cells after cell fractionation and immunoprecipitation with anti-HA mAb followed by anti-PKC-δ immunoblot analysis. Stimulation with TPA for 10 min caused translocation of a similar portion of both pLTR-δWT-HA and pLTR-δS643A-HA mutant proteins to the membrane fraction (Fig. 6 A, lanes 4 and 6). Reblotting the membrane with anti-Tyr(P) mAb showed that both pLTR-δWT-HA and pLTR-δS643A-HA mutant proteins were tyrosine-phosphorylated in TPA-stimulated samples (Fig. 6 B, lanes 4 and 6). As previously demonstrated (6Li W. Yu J.-C. Shin D.-Y. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8311-8318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Li W. Yu J.-C. Michieli P. Beeler J.F. Ellmore N. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6727-6735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), tyrosine phosphorylation was observed only in the membrane fraction. Taken together, the results indicate that autophosphorylation of PKC-δ on serine 643 does not affect localization, translocation, or tyrosine phosphorylation of the enzyme. TPA treatment of 32D cells overexpressing PKC-δWT was able to mediate monocytic differentiation, as judged by changes in morphology, cell adhesion, nonspecific esterase staining, and cell surface differentiation marker expression (5Mischak H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8311-8318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Since mutation of PKC-δ on serine 643 reduced its autophosphorylation and its enzymatic activity, we tested whether PKC-δ-mediated monocytic differentiation would be affected. Treatment of the pLTR-δS643A-HA mutant transfectant with TPA overnight resulted in reduced cell adhesion and less morphological changes indicative of the macrophage phenotype as analyzed by Wright-Giemsa staining when compared with the pLTR-δWT-HA transfectant (data not shown). Flow cytometric analysis was utilized to detect cell surface differentiation marker expression. As seen in Fig. 7, stimulation of pLTR-δWT-HA transfectant with TPA overnight resulted in increased expression of Mac-1 (Fig. 7 A) and FcγII/IIIR (Fig. 7 B). TPA treatment of the pLTR-δS643A-HA mutant transfectant resulted in reduced increases in marker expression in comparison to the pLTR-δWT-HA transfectant (Fig. 7, A andB). However, the TPA-induced increase in marker expression observed for the pLTR-δS643A-HA mutant transfectant was still greater than that for the parental 32D cells, indicating that the remaining kinase activity provided by the pLTR-δS643A-HA mutant was able to partially mediate the differentiation process. These results suggest that serine autophosphorylation on amino acid 643 plays an important role in PKC-δ-mediated monocytic differentiation of 32D myeloid progenitor cells. In the present study, we have demonstrated that serine 643 of PKC-δ is a major autophosphorylation site in vitro and autophosphorylation of PKC-δ on this site is required for its full enzymatic activity. TPA-induced monocytic differentiation of 32D cells overexpressing PKC-δS643A is reduced in comparison to the PKC-δWT transfectant, suggesting that the mutant protein is less efficient at activating key substrate(s) which affect the differentiation process. The effects of site-directed mutagenesis of PKC-α and PKC-βI at similarly conserved sites were recently reported (23Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1114-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 29Zhang J. Wang L. Schwartz J. Bond R.W. Bishop W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although noin vitro autophosphorylation data were presented in either study, transphosphorylation of the histone substrate in vitro by PKC-αT638A mutant was reduced by 26% (23Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1114-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In contrast, the PKC-βIT642A mutant completely abolished in vivo phosphorylation and enzymatic activity (29Zhang J. Wang L. Schwartz J. Bond R.W. Bishop W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether mutagenesis of PKC-βI affected the general conformation of the protein remains to be determined. This was suggested by the inability to label in vivo the PKC-βIT642A mutant protein with [32P]orthophosphate. Although an ATP binding mutant of PKC-δ (PKC-δK376R) generated in our laboratory was completely devoid of autophosphorylation capacity (6Li W. Yu J.-C. Shin D.-Y. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8311-8318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), it could still be labeledin vivo by [32P]orthophosphate. 2W. Li, unpublished observations.Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of the PKC-δK376R mutant revealed that at least two autophosphorylation sites were absent when compared with PKC-δWT, indicating that other sites in addition to serine 643 must contribute to PKC-δ autophosphorylation.2Moreover, the present results provide evidence that autophosphorylation of the PKC-δS643A mutant is not completely abolished (see Fig. 3). PKC-δS643A mutant could be labeled in vivo to a similar extent as PKC-δWT (see Fig. 4). Based on recent mapping and site-directed mutagenesis results involving PKC-α at serine 657 (24Bornancin F. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3544-3549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and PKC-βII at serine 660 (20Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), we predict that the corresponding serine 662 of PKC-δ may be an additional autophosphorylation site. Generation of a serine 643 to alanine mutant of PKC-δ did not affect the translocation of PKC-δ from the cytosol to the membrane in response to TPA stimulation, nor did it affect its tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo. These data indicate that site-directed mutagenesis did not alter the general conformation of the molecule. This is also suggested by the similar two-dimensional phosphopeptide pattern observed for both PKC-δWT and PKC-δS643A (see Fig. 4, A and B). Translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane is dependent on the binding of phorbol ester or endogenously produced diacylglycerol to the regulatory domain of PKC (1Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC-δ has also been mapped at the N terminus of PKC-δ (30Li W. Li W. Chen X.-H. Kelley C.A. Alimandi M. Zhang J. Chen Q. Bottaro D.P. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26404-26409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was not surprising that mutation of serine 643 did not affect these events since this mutation resides in the C terminus of the molecule. Although phosphorylation has been implicated to be important for PKC localization, expression of PKC-δS643A did not alter the localization of the molecule. This can be best explained by the finding that in vitroautophosphorylation was diminished by only 65–83% in the mutant (see Fig. 3). Thus, alternative autophosphorylation sites may compensate and allow the mutant protein to normally regulate localization through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation dynamics. In summary, our results demonstrate that serine 643 is a major autophosphorylation site of PKC-δ. Autophosphorylation of PKC-δ on this site is indispensable for its full enzymatic activity but is not required or sufficient for determining the localization, translocation, or tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC-δ. Mapping the remaining autophosphorylation site(s) within PKC-δ should make it feasible to determine the complete role of autophosphorylation and its effects on the various aspects of PKC-δ function.

Nature. 1995; 375: 24Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that a fully coupled state can be attained in potato mitochondria only when a purine nucleotide such as ATP is present, and, simultaneously, free fatty acids (FAs) are absent. A hydrophobic, 32-kDa-protein was isolated, similar in all respects to the mammalian uncoupling protein (UcP) of brown adipose tissue mitochondria (1Vercesi A.E. Martins I.S. Silva M.A.P. Leite H.M.F. Cuccovia I.M. Chaimovich H. Nature. 1995; 375: 24Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, as in the brown adipose tissue, the site of mammalian nonshivering thermogenesis, mitochondria from certain plant tissues may contain a protein that allows for regulated uncoupling (2Jez̆ek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol.

Martins I.S. Silva M.A.P. Leite H.M.F. Cuccovia I.M. Chaimovich H. Nature. 1995; 375: 24Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the first reconstitution experiments with PUMP (1Vercesi A.E. Martins I.S. Silva M.A.P. Leite H.M.F. Cuccovia I.M. Chaimovich H.

In this respect, PUMP was found indistinguishable from the mammalian UcP. Further studies using potato mitochondria have shown that FAs interact directly with PUMP, since they induce an H+-dependent swelling in potassium acetate medium in the presence of valinomycin (2Jez̆ek P.

Both proteins facilitate the uniport of amphiphilic anions, including fatty acids. This should lead to uncoupling by the FA-cycling mechanism (7Skulachev V.P.

If a membrane protein possesses the ability to mediate uniport of anionic FAs, then they must undergo cycling, alternating between protonated and anionic forms.

In this study, we use the reconstituted system to evaluate whether a mechanism of transport similar to that suggested for UcP could also be valid for PUMP. In particular, we investigate, whether PUMP is able to conduct anionic fatty acids. Artificial and natural FAs were from Fluka (Switzerland) or Sigma, undecanesulfonate was from Lancaster (UK), hydroxylapatite from Bio-Rad, PBFI and SPQ were from Molecular Probes. Reconstitution was carried out using materials as described elsewhere (4Jez̆ek P. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Garlid K.D. J. Biol.

Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation in a medium of 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm K-MOPS, 1 mm Tris-EGTA, pH 7.4 (10Beavis A.D. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3079-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), routinely containing 1% BSA. The acidic tomato homogenate was neutralized immediately by KOH. Extraction was performed by suspending mitochondria (60 mg of protein) in 2.5 ml of 50 mm TEA2-SO4, 20 mm TEA-TES, pH 7.2 ([TEA] = 6.6 mm), 0.2 mm Tris-EDTA, containing 4.5% octylpentaoxyethylene, while stirring for 30 min at 0 °C. The extract was spun at 100,000 ×g for 30 min (Beckman L8-M), and then the supernatant was applied to a spin-column containing 3 g of hydroxylapatite, prewashed with the “elution medium” (30 mmTEA2-SO4, 5 mm TEA-TES, pH 7.2 ([TES] = 1.66 mm), 0.2 mm Tris-EDTA). The paste was incubated for 45 min at 5 °C and then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 2 min. A step-wise elution (1 ml per step) (11Jez̆ek P. Freisleben H.-J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) yielded the diluted first fraction and three additional fractions containing approximately 0.1 mg of protein/ml. All four fractions contained the 32-kDa PUMP protein. Isolated PUMP and PBFI or SPQ were added to lipid/octylpentaoxyethylene micellar solution, and the detergent was removed using Bio-Beads SM2 (Bio-Rad). The external probe was washed out using Sephadex G-25–300 (11Jez̆ek P. Freisleben H.-J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Transport in proteoliposomes containing one of the fluorescent indicators PBFI (12Jez̆ek P. Mahdi F. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10522-10526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or SPQ (13Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 150: 97-104Google Scholar) was detected using a Hitachi model F-4010 fluorometer (Hitachi, Japan). FAs were added directly to the assay medium as microliter aliquots of the stock solutions in ethanol. PBFI fluorescence is enhanced by [K+] and can be used to monitor the uptake of K+ that accompanies uptake of anionic FA. Thus, addition of K+ ionophore valinomycin (1.3 μm) was used to initiate a net charge flux (the influx of FA anion) together with the return of protonated FA in proteoliposomes containing PUMP. In other experiments, the net influx of alkylsulfonates was detected in the same way. Fluorescence records were transformed into “K+traces” using calibration curves (12Jez̆ek P. Mahdi F. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10522-10526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) constructed by adding KCl stepwise in the presence of 0.2 μm nigericin. The initial rates (d[K+]/dt) were calculated in mm·s−1. Vesicle interiors contained 75 mm TEA2SO4, 75 mmTEA-TES, pH 7.2, 0.05 mm K2SO4 and 300 μm PBFI. Vesicles (25 μl) were added to 1.475 ml of 75 mm K2SO4, 75 mmTEA-TES, pH 7.2, or to mixtures of the external and internal medium to vary the K+-diffusion potential. Vesicle volume was estimated as described previously (6Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The method is based on the quenching of SPQ fluorescence by the TES− anion, but not by neutral TES (13Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 150: 97-104Google Scholar), and was employed to monitor the internal acidification that results from FA's flipping to the internal lipid leaflet. Alternatively, SPQ served as an indicator of the internal alkalinization resulting from the valinomycin-induced uptake of anionic FAs and the concomitant H+ efflux. Vesicles (25 μl) containing 84.4 mm TEA-SO4, 28.9 mmTEA-TES, pH 7.2 ([TEA] = 9.2 mm), and 0.6 mmTris-EGTA, were added to external medium (1.475 ml) containing 84.4 mm K2SO4, 28.85 mmTEA-TES, pH 7.2, ([TEA] = 9.2 mm), and 0.6 mmTris-EGTA. PUMP-mediated FA cycling was initiated by adding 1.3 μm valinomycin. Calibration curves were constructed by adding KOH stepwise in the presence of nigericin (6Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M.

Biochem. 1993; 150: 97-104Google Scholar). According to the Eyring theory (14Eyring H. Eyring E. Modern Chemical Kinetics. Rheinold, New York1963Google Scholar, 15Laugher P. Stark G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 211: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), the movement of an ion across a single energetic barrier (a sharp peak) depends exponentially upon the applied voltage. Garlid et al. (16Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. Ratkje S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 976: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have developed a simplified description of flux-voltage characteristics, which is valid at higher potentials and relates a net ion flux J with the reduced voltage, u J=P·C1·eβuEquation 1 where parameter β describes the degree of nonlinearity and its value reflects the particular energetic barrier model;u = −zFΔΨ/RT, where the terms have their usual meanings; P is the permeability coefficient, and C 1 is the concentration of species in the membrane/water interface at the cis-side. Linearization of Equation 1 yields the simple expression (in the case of an anion with z = −1)lnJ=lnPC1+βu=lnPC1+βFΔΨ/RTEquation 2 It has been shown that for a single-sharp-peak barrier, β = 0.5 and this was experimentally found for tetramethylammonium ion permeation (16Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. Ratkje S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 976: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and for SCN−influx 2P. Jez̆ek and K. D. Garlid, unpublished data. into liposomes; for the extreme case of a “smoothed multiple barrier,” β approaches 0.16, the value for a rectangular barrier, thus giving nearly linear (ohmic) J-ΔΨ characteristics. Interestingly, in the case of two sharp barriers with an energy well (an internal binding site) in the middle, this theory predicts that β = 0.25, and this was indeed found for Cl− uniport via UcP (17Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 141-154Google Scholar), in which the existence of an internal anion binding site was documented (3Jez̆ek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol.

The experimental approach based on creation of a K+-diffusion potential in liposomes has a drawback due to a capacitance effect that causes a parasitic K+ influx at large external [K+] and limits flux at low external [K+]. However, since the same interference is expected in each case, a flux-voltage analysis derived from the experimental data can be valuable for comparing different translocated ions. In addition, this analysis allows one to determine permeability coefficientsP, calculated by extrapolating flux-voltage data to zero voltage, where J 0 =P·C 1 (in nmol·s−1) and using theoretical values for surface area (lipid packing 70 Å2 per molecule). Purified PUMP from potato (Fig.1, A and B) and red tomato mitochondria (not shown) reconstituted in lecithin liposomes containing cardiolipin was able to mediate a net uptake of anionic FAs and alkylsulfonates as indicated by the fluorescent K+probe, PBFI. PUMP was able to translocate anionic forms of linoleic acid (Fig. 1 A), stearic and heptylbenzoic acid, but not phenylvaleric or abscisic acid (not shown). Undecanesulfonate and, at 10-fold higher concentration, hexanesulfonate were also translocated, but not Cl− (Fig. 1 B). With both potato and tomato PUMP, all these transport activities were inhibited up to 50% by externally added ATP (Fig. 1 A) and GDP, indicating that 50% of the PUMP molecules are oriented with the nucleotide binding site outward. In proteoliposomes loaded with 5 mm Tris-ATP, addition of 5 mm ATP to the external medium inhibited by 70%. The remaining flux represented the leak. Consequently, the overall inhibition with ATP present both externally and internally was 80–90% (Fig. 1 A). The SPQ probe, in combination with TES, provides a sensitive system for the measurement of H+ fluxes. In accordance with Kamp and Hamilton (8Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11086Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and Garlid et al. (6Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), we show (Fig.2 A) that the addition of linoleic acid to protein-free liposomes causes an internal acidification concomitant to a flipping of FA to the inner lipid leaflet and subsequent dissociation of H+ into the vesicle interior. When valinomycin is added, no significant H+movement occurs (Fig. 2 A). This demonstrates an important property of prepared vesicles. They must be tightly sealed, having membranes with a low H+ permeability. In contrast, when proteoliposomes containing potato (Fig. 2 B) or tomato PUMP (Fig. 2 C) are used, the addition of valinomycin after FA induces a purine nucleotide-sensitive H+ efflux. Note that the addition of linoleic acid to the proteoliposomes caused similar acidification of the interior, as it did in liposomes. External ATP inhibited the linoleic acid-induced H+ efflux by 94%, when proteoliposomes were loaded with 5 mm Na-ATP (Fig.2 B). This accounts for the overall 97% inhibition by external plus internal ATP. The dose-response curve for externally added ATP (not shown) yielded an apparent K i of 1.5 mm at pH 7.2, a value comparable to theK i (0.8 mm) for ATP inhibition of H+-dependent swelling of potato mitochondria in the presence of FA (2Jez̆ek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32743-32749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The H+ efflux was induced only by FAs that were able to acidify the liposome interior (Fig. 2 B) and were translocated in the anionic form as indicated by the PBFI probe. Besides linoleic acid, this was observed with stearic and heptylbenzoic acid, but not with phenylvaleric or abscisic acid. Although the latter FAs exist in a dissociated form, they were unable to flip-flop in the lipid bilayer, as indicated by the lack of liposome acidification (Fig.2 A). Being unable to flip-flop, they did not promote H+ efflux (Fig. 2 B) or the anion transport activity (see above) in vesicles containing PUMP. As reported before (6Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), undecanesulfonate was unable to acidify the vesicles' interior, nor did it induce an H+ efflux after the addition of valinomycin (Fig. 2 C). Using PBFI we evaluated the kinetics of linoleic acid anion uniport. With plain rates (not shown), the K m derived from the double-reciprocal plot was 45 μm at 135 mV, a value close to K m obtained by the SPQ technique (43 or 57 μm, cf. below). TheV max was 1.16 mm·s−1at 135 mV and 3 mm·s−1 at 187 mV. These values correspond to minimum specific activities 3Minimum specific activities (rates) were calculated on the assumption that 100% of the added isolated PUMP protein was inserted properly into the membrane. of 35 and 90 μmol·min−1·mg of protein−1, respectively. A slightly higher K m (80–115 μm, Fig. 3) was obtained for linoleic acid when the basal rates obtained in the presence of BSA were subtracted, and in this case V max reached 1.4–1.5 mm·s−1 at 135 mV. The kinetics of undecanesulfonate uniport exhibited a lower K m, 18 μm at 187 mV and 16 μm at 135 mV without corrections, increasing to 64 μm and 59 μm, respectively, with corrections (Fig. 3). In this case theV max values were lower: 0.5–0.6 mm·s−1 at 187 mV and 0.24 mm·s−1 at 135 mV (15–18 and 7.3 μmol·min−1·mg of protein−1, respectively). The kinetics of heptylbenzoic acid-induced H+ transport (Fig. 3, SPQ detection) exhibited much higher values: a K m of 504 μm andV max of 1.48 mm·s−1, or 44 μmol·min−1·mg of protein−1. The lowest apparent affinity for PUMP was found for hexanesulfonate uniport (K m between 7 and 10 mm andV max of 0.3–0.5 mm·s−1 at 180 mV). As a PUMP substrate, undecanesulfonate was also able to inhibit the FA-induced H+ efflux in proteoliposomes containing PUMP. The inhibitory constant K i (around 92 μm, Fig. 4) was slightly higher than the K i for inhibition of UcP-mediated transport (6Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Preincubation with undecanesulfonate was required to obtain reproducible results. The observed inhibition may reflect a competition of undecanesulfonate and linoleate at a hypothetical internal FA binding site of PUMP. One factor that may artificially enhance the inhibition is the negative surface charge that is created by the added alkylsulfonate due to its inability to flip-flop. This charge would not be present with FA alone. Its presence can be inferred from the effect of 100–400 μm undecanesulfonate, which partially suppressed the initial acidification of the proteoliposome interior upon addition of FA. However, since addition of KOH in the presence of nigericin results in alkalinization of the vesicle interior even with 366 μm undecanesulfonate present, it is unlikely that the surface charge effect obstructs inhibitory dose responses. Moreover, the kinetics of H+ efflux in proteoliposomes containing PUMP measured at various undecanesulfonate concentrations showed a pattern that is typical of specific inhibition (Fig. 5). The scatter of the data did not allow us to determine precisely the nature of the inhibition, but it was possible to fit the data using a model for competitive inhibition (Fig. 5, solid lines), in which K mincreases at constant V max. Thus,K m increased from 57 μm in the absence of undecanesulfonate to 90, 124, and 182 μm in the presence of 90, 200, and 366 μm undecanesulfonate, respectively.Figure 5Undecanesulfonate inhibition of PUMP-mediated, linoleate-induced H+ efflux.Double-reciprocal plots of the valinomycin-induced H+efflux detected with SPQ (see Fig. 2 B) were constructed from the uncorrected rates at different concentrations of linoleic acid in the absence (▾) and in the presence of undecanesulfonate (▪) at a final concentration of 366 μm. Samples of proteoliposomes were preincubated with undecanesulfonate (see legend to Fig. 4). Linear regressions using a Marquart algorithm yielded K m = 57.3 μm, V max = 2.19 mm·s−1 and the K m = 182 μm in the presence of undecanesulfonate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The rates of PUMP-mediated H+ efflux induced by linoleic (Fig.6 A) and heptylbenzoic acid (not shown) increased exponentially with the applied voltage (K+ diffusion potential, ΔΨ). An identical exponential dependence was obtained, independently of whether PBFI or SPQ was used (Fig. 6 A). Linearization of the flux-voltage characteristics for linoleic acid using Equation 2 (Fig. 6, insets) yielded a slope (β) of 0.85 when the probe was PBFI, 0.75 when the probe was SPQ, and 1 for heptylbenzoic acid (SPQ probe). The rates of undecanesulfonate and hexanesulfonate uniport via PUMP also increased exponentially with ΔΨ (Fig. 6 B), but linearizations yielded lower slopes, 0.35 and 0.36, respectively. The H+ permeability coefficients for proteoliposomes containing PUMP in the presence of linoleic acid were 4.5.10−2 cm·s−1 when PBFI was used and 5.8.10−2 cm·s−1 when SPQ was used. These values are two orders of magnitude higher than the coefficients for the basal H+ permeability of lipid bilayer measured in liposomes (18Freisleben H.-J. Zwicker K. Jez̆ek P. John G. Bettin-Bogutzki A. Ring K. Nawroth T. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1995; 78: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For the transport of alkylsulfonates at zero ΔΨ permeability coefficients of proteoliposomes were even higher (see legend to Fig. 6 B). We have demonstrated the ability of the PUMP to interact with FAs and conduct monovalent unipolar amphiphilic anions, such as alkylsulfonates. The mutual competition between FAs and alkylsulfonates (Figs. 4 and 5) (2Jez̆ek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32743-32749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and induction of H+ transport exclusively with FAs having the ability to flip-flop across the lipid bilayer in a protonated form, suggest that PUMP conducts FA anions and, consequently, allows for FA cycling, which leads to uncoupling (6Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). PUMP is the third example of an integral membrane protein possessing this ability, besides the mammalian uncoupling protein UcP (6Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and the ADP/ATP carrier (19Brustovetsky N. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27329-27336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Schönfeld P Jez̆ek P. Borecký J. Belyaeva E. Slyshenkov V.S. Wieçkowski M.R. Wojtczak L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although discovered recently (1Vercesi A.E. Martins I.S. Silva M.A.P. Leite H.M.F. Cuccovia I.M. Chaimovich H. Nature. 1995; 375: 24Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar), PUMP is now well characterized functionally. Similarly to the mammalian UcP, PUMP does not act as an H+ conductor, but ensures the uniport of fatty acids and long-chain amphiphiles in a process that is inhibited by purine nucleotide di- and triphosphates. However, PUMP exhibits a much lower affinity toward nucleotides than does UcP (2Jez̆ek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32743-32749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Contrary to UcP, PUMP is unable to conduct small hydrophilic anions such as Cl−. Indeed, Cl− flux via PUMP is nearly zero, since no transport was observed even at 150 mm Cl− (the rates were equal to the basal rates in the presence of BSA). This may reflect limited access of Cl− to a hypothetical intramembraneous FA (anion) binding site. The existence of such a site is suggested by the fact that PUMP exhibits higher affinities for more hydrophobic substrates, linoleate and undecanesulfonate (lower K m values for their uniport) and lower affinities for less hydrophobic hexanesulfonate and heptylbenzoate (higher K m values for uniport). Note, for example, that heptylbenzoic acid, as a medium-chain FA, should cross the membrane faster than linoleic acid, as observed in liposomes (Fig. 2 A). Its partition coefficient is no lower than that for linoleate, since the extent of acidification of the vesicles' interior upon addition of heptylbenzoic acid is even higher than for linoleic acid (Fig. 2 A). Nevertheless, its affinity for PUMP is lower, suggesting that a rate-limiting step is imposed by the PUMP-mediated transport of FA. The existence of the anion binding site of PUMP is also implied by the mutual competition between FAs and alkylsulfonates (Figs. 4 and 5) (2Jez̆ek P. Costa A.D.T. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32743-32749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Such competition has been documented for the mammalian UcP by numerous kinetic (4Jez̆ek P. Orosz D.E.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and photoaffinity-labeling experiments (5Jez̆ek P. Hanuö J. Semrad C. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6199-6205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Růz̆ic̆ka M. Borecký J. Hanuö J. Jez̆ek P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The FA cycling mechanism for PUMP is suggested by phenomena similar to those found for UcP (6Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Thus, both FAs and alkylsulfonates exhibit a net charge transfer. However, undecanesulfonate, having a pK a around 2, cannot be protonated at pH 7.2, and cannot flip across the lipid bilayer to acidify the vesicles' interior (6Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Also, in contrast to FA, it does not induce H+transport in proteoliposomes containing UcP (6Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) or PUMP (Fig.2 C). Since FAs such as linoleic acid do induce H+ transport in proteoliposomes, we conclude that this is due to their ability to flip-flop across the lipid bilayer in a protonated form. This conclusion was confirmed by the experiments with so-called “inactive” FAs which are unable to flip-flop, but retain the ability to partition into the membrane (9Jez̆ek P. Modrianský M. Garlid K.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For example, phenylvaleric acid did not acidify the lumen of liposomes or proteoliposomes (Fig. 2, A and B), did not induce significant H+ transport in proteoliposomes (Fig.2 B) and did not exhibit charge transfer. The analog, heptylbenzoic acid, was able to flip-flop (Fig. 2 A) and exhibited both H+ transport and the charge transfer in proteoliposomes (Fig. 2 B). The K m values for FA uniport (FA cycling) were similar to those found for the mammalian UcP (6Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jez̆ek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). When expressed in terms of total concentrations added to the bulk medium, theK m values reflect an overall sequence of events: partitioning into the membrane, binding to the internal FA binding site, and the kinetics of flip-flop. Based on the partition coefficient of 100,000 for linoleic acid (23Anel A. Richieri G.V. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 32: 530-536Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar), at a total concentration of 50 μm, it will be distributed with 0.56 μmfree in solution and 49.44 μm in the membrane. If 100% insertion of PUMP is assumed, the molar ratio of linoleic acid to the dimeric PUMP is 11. Since the observed K m is well above the critical micellar concentration (13 μm) for linoleic acid in water (24Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23495-23501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), micelles will be formed when it is first added, but they will disappear immediately after its partitioning into the bilayer. Consequently, FA is embedded in the membrane before it can interact with PUMP. We have also documented that FA-induced H+ transport and alkylsulfonate uniport depends exponentially on membrane potential, ΔΨ, as predicted (16Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. Ratkje S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 976: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and as found for Cl− uniport via UcP (17Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 141-154Google Scholar). Note that a linear (ohmic) J-ΔΨ characteristic was found only for the uncoupler-mediated H+ transport (25Krishnamoorthy G. Hinkle P.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1640-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The linearized J-ΔΨ characteristics obtained for alkylsulfonate uniport via PUMP yielded slopes around 0.35, which are close to the value found for Cl− uniport via UcP. Bearing in mind possible interfering effects (see “Experimental Procedures”), we cannot determine whether the data are compatible with an existence of an internal anion binding site. 4Hydrophobicity of alkylsulfonates or capacitance effects might contribute to a slightly higher value of slope (β) when compared with Cl− uniport via UcP (17Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 141-154Google Scholar). Also, theJ-ΔΨ characteristics for PUMP-mediated H+transport induced by FAs differ from the characteristics reported in the literature. 5This is not an argument against a common transport pathway for FAs and alkylsulfonates, which is supported by their mutual competition and common ATP inhibition. Rather, the interfering effects might be stronger with FA, since higher slopes of linearizations of the J-ΔΨ plots were also found for UcP (P. Jez̆ek, unpublished data) for which the common pathway was demonstrated. In this case, additional effects might interfere, such as preequilibration of FA in both leaflets of the lipid bilayer, increasing background flux with ΔΨ and other phenomena which will tend to exaggerate the ΔΨ dependence and increase the slope β. Having suggested a mechanism of PUMP function, we can propose some of the consequences for plant mitochondria that have this protein. As found for thermogenic brown fat in mammals (26Nedergaard J. Cannon B. New Compr. Biochem. 1992; 23: 385-420Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar), regulated uncoupling should lead to the release of heat. The question of whether this heat production is the primary function of PUMP, or whether modulation of oxidative phosphorylation is the primary one must be resolved in further studies. Our findings of active PUMP in the ripe (red) tomatoes and in potato tubers suggest a role for regulated uncoupling during fruit ripening, senescence, and seed dormancy. Mitochondria in fruits play their role until the final stages of ripening (27Gardestrom P. Lernmark U. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Smart C.M. New Phytol. 1994; 126: 419-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), and in storage tissues during the whole lifetime. A regulated uncoupling promoted by PUMP could be the primary cause of the climacteric rise in respiration (29The Biochemistry of Fruits and Their Products, Academic Press, LondonHulme, A. C. (ed) The Biochemistry of Fruits and Their Products, Academic Press, LondonGoogle Scholar), known since 1925 (30Kidd, F., and West, C (1925) Great Britain Department of Science and Industry Research Food Invets. Board Report 27Google Scholar). Ethylene (C2H4), a natural ripening hormone, was recently shown to initiate these marked biochemical changes in climacteric fruits (31Oeller P.W. Min-Wong L. Taylor L.P. Pike D.A. Theologis A. Science. 1991; 254: 437-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), including tomato, banana, mango, avocado, pineapple, and pome fruits. The respiration burst in these fruits has been traditionally explained as a function of the alternative oxidase (32Moore A.L. Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 33Day A.D. Wiskich J.T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34Krab K. J.

Gomez-Lim M.A. Planta. 1995; 197: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). If PUMP was active in the climacteric fruits, storage tissues, and other plant organs, their mitochondria would posses a fine control of oxidative phosphorylation, not only by eliminating H+ pumping when switching to alternative oxidase, but also by shortcircuiting the H+ pumping, i.e. also by protonmotive force consumption.

These pluripotent cells have the ability to differentiate into derivatives of three germ layers, endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm, upon different inducer stimulation (29Jones-Villeneuve E.M.V.

Monolayer cultures of P19 cells challenged with 50 nm retinoic acid (RA) differentiate to endodermal-like cells (31Jones-Villeneuve E.M.V. McBurney M.W. Rogers K.A. Kalnins V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In the current study we show that JNK activity is increased during RA-induced differentiation of P19 cells and the progression of P19 cell differentiation by Gα12 and Gα13 is mediated by JNK, but not ERK or p38 MAPK. Expression of the dominant negative form of JNK1 is shown to block RA-induced differentiation of embryonal cells to endoderm, establishing an obligate role of JNK in a model of early mouse embryogenesis. The P19 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) in 6% CO2 humidified chamber. To induce endodermal differentiation, P19 cells were cultured as monolayers on tissue culture plates in growth media supplemented with 10 nm RA (all-trans; Sigma) for 2–5 days. The antisense sequences, 5′-AGCTTCAGGCCGCGGCCGCGCCCCGCTGGGGCCCGCGCG CCAT-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCTCGGCGGGCCCCTGCGGCTCCTAT-3′ derived from the cDNA sequences of mouse Gα12and Gα13 (32Offermanns S.

Johnson (National Jewish Center for Immunology, Denver, CO). The plasmid containing the cDNA for the Flag epitope-tagged, dominant negative form of JNK1 replaces the dual phosphorylation sites Thr-Pro-Tyr with Ala-Pro-Phe (pCMV5-JNK1APF) and was employed to probe the role of JNK in P19 cell differentiation. P19 cells were transfected with plasmids using LipofectinTM (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. For pCMV5-JNK1-(APF), the pCW1-neo plasmid was co-transfected to provide a selectable marker. Positive transfectants were selected using G418 (400 mg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) and stable transfectant clones maintained in media supplemented with 100 mg/ml G418. The ability of the antisense RNAs to suppress the expression of Gα12 and Gα13 in the transfectant clones was determined by immunoblotting analysis. Expression of pcDNA3-Gα12 (Q229L) or pcDNA3-Gα13 (Q226L) was established by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. For immunoprecipitations and FPLC analysis, P19 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) and lysed. Lysis buffer contains 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 5 mg/ml leupeptin, 6.0 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 200 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 1% Triton X-100. After 20 min at 4 °C with constant rotation the cell lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 14,000 × gfor 15 min, and the resultant supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. Protein content was measured by the Lowry method (35Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Aliquots of protein were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically from the gel to nitrocellulose membrane. Antibodies to the following antigens employed in these studies were obtained from the indicated sources: JNK 1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; ERK1 and 2, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco; p38 MAPK, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, Gα12, Dr. Gunther Schultz, Freie University, Berlin, Germany and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; and Gα13, Dr. Gunther Schultz, Freie University, Berlin, Germany and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, or a rabbit polyclonal antiserum obtained by immunization with a synthetic C-terminal dodecapeptide of Gα13. The immune complexes formed were made visible by using alkaline phosphatase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, Inc.), rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Life Technologies, Inc.), or rabbit anti-goat IgG (Sigma). An aliquot (250 μg to 1 mg of protein) of the clarified lysate was mixed with the JNK1-specific antibody and resuspended to 1.0 ml in the same cell lysis buffer. After 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation, 20–40 μl of Protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 1.5 h. The immunoprecipitates were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The pellets were washed twice with same lysis buffer and then washed twice with JNK assay buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate). Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in a final volume of 40 μl of the JNK assay buffer. A 20-μl aliquot was used for Western blot analysis and the other 20 μl was used for JNK assay. Aliquots of immunoprecipitates were mixed with 2 μg of GST-fusion proteins encoding for the N-terminal region of Jun-(1–79) (36Moxham C.M. Tabrizchi A. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol.

Reaction was started by addition of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/tube, 100 μm final concentration) and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Reaction was stopped by addition of 6 μl of 4 × Laemmli buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 8% SDS, 0.08% bromphenol blue, and 40% glycerol). After separation of proteins by 10% SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 and autoradiography, the bands for GST-Jun were excised and the incorporated 32P was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Undifferentiated and differentiated P19 cells were harvested and lysed. An aliquot of sample (2.5 mg of protein) was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer and fractionated by chromatography on a Mono Q HR 5/5 FPLC column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). The column was washed with 8 column volumes of buffer A (70 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and the bound proteins were eluted with a 12.5-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0–400 mm) in buffer A. Twenty-five fractions (0.5 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A 15-μl aliquot of FPLC fraction was mixed with 5 μl of 4 × kinase assay buffer (100 mm β-glycerophosphate, 160 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 40 mmMgCl2, 100 μg/ml protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, 2 mm EGTA) and 2 μg of either MBP (Sigma) or GST-ATF2-(1–109) (36Moxham C.M.

Each reaction was started by addition of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/tube, 100 μm final concentration) and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by addition of 6 μl of 4 × Laemmli buffer. After separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels, staining of the resolved proteins with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, and autoradiography, the bands for either MBP or GST-ATF2-(1–109) were excised, and the incorporated 32P into these substrates was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Cells were grown in Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY) and were fixed for 10 min with 3% paraformaldehyde. After fixation, slides were rinsed three times with modified Shield's media/Pipes (modified Shield's media; 18 mm MgSO4, 5 mmCaCl2, 40 mm KCl, 24 mm NaCl, 5 mm Pipes (pH 6.8), 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). A monoclonal antibody MC-480 (SSEA-1) that reacts with a stem-cell surface antigen marker (37Solter D. Knowles B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MC-480 was obtained from the NIH Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Baltimore, MD). The fixed cells were incubated with primary antibody for 30 min at 37 °C and then washed three times with modified Shield's media/Pipes buffer. Fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The slides were washed then three times with blotting buffer (560 mm NaCl, 10 mm KPO4 (pH 7.5), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.02% SDS). The cells were examined by phase contrast and epifluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss Axiphot microscope and photographed on Kodak-64T or Kodak-TMax 400 film. The P19 cells differentiate to neuroectoderm-like phenotypes (29Jones-Villeneuve E.M.V. Rudincki M.A. Harris J.F. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell.

In the absence of aggregation, P19 cells are induced to differentiate by RA but only to the endoderm-like phenotype (29, Fig.1), providing a useful model for study of this process. P19 embryonic cells stain positive in indirect immunofluorescence study of cells probed with antibody to the embryonic marker SSEA-1 (Fig. 1, panel B). The cells induced morphologically to endoderm by RA no longer stain positive with the same antibody, displaying a loss in the embryonic marker antigen SSEA-1 (Fig. 1, panel D). Endodermal cells stain positive with TROMA-1, a monoclonal antibody to the endoderm-specific marker cytokeratin-1 (37Solter D. Knowles B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Untreated P19 cells stain negative for TROMA-1 (Fig. 1, panel F), reflecting their embryonal character, whereas RA-treated P19 cells stain prominently for TROMA-1 (Fig. 1,panel H), a hallmark for endodermal development (37Solter D. Knowles B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5565-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 38Kemler R. Brulet P. Schnebelen M. Gaillard J. Jacob F. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1981; 64: 45-60PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of epifluorescence signals from the RA-treated cells stained with SSEA-1, from the untreated P19 cells stained with TROMA-1, and from the controls performed without primary antibody (not shown) provide ample evidence for the specificity of the staining in defining endoderm versus embryonal character (Fig. 1). Since heterotrimeric G-proteins have been implicated in control of P19 cell differentiation (39Jho E. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and Gα12 and Gα13 are known to mediate the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, especially c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (16Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we explored the role of MAP kinases in P19 cell differentiation, with an emphasis on Gα12 and Gα13. To explore the role of MAP kinases in P19 cell differentiation, cells were treated with retinoic acid (100 nm) for 3 days to achieve full differentiation to endodermal phenotype and a cell extract prepared and fractionated by FPLC on a Source Q column (Fig.2 A). Immunoblotting of samples from the fractions revealed ERK1,2 in fractions 9–11 and p38 in fractions 14–19 of extracts from untreated P19 cells. MAP kinase activity was measured using myelin basic protein (MBP), which is a substrate for both p38 and ERK1,2. The profile of activities coincides with the appearance of ERK1,2 and p38 kinases in the immunoblots, shown as insets (Fig. 2, panel A). When MAP kinase activity was measured in fractions from an FPLC of RA-treated, endodermal cells, a modest but highly reproducible (n = 3) decline in ERK1,2 activity was observed in each profile (Fig. 2,panel A). MAP kinase activity in the region of the profile in which p38 was found increased slightly in the extracts from the RA-treated, endodermal P19 cells in each of three separate analyses (Fig. 2, panel A). The status of p38 kinase activity in the FPLC fractions from untreated and RA-treated P19 cells was measured further, using GST-ATF2 fusion protein, as ATF2 is a specific substrate for p38 and not ERK1,2 (Fig. 2 B). The activity was confined to the same FPLC fractions as judged by immunoblotting and phosphorylation of the ATF2-fusion protein. In extracts from RA-treated P19 cells, again, the p38 activity displayed a small but reproducible increase compared with the activity in profiles from untreated P19 cells. Unlike the modest changes observed in the activity of p38 or ERK1,2 in the RA-treated cells, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase activity (JNK) displays marked activation upon treatment of the cells with RA (Fig.2 C). JNK activity in the solid-state assay using GST-Jun fusion protein increases from 2.7-fold on day 2 to 7.8-fold on day 3 following induction of differentiation in response to RA. Based upon multiple experiments, the increase in JNK activity (fold over basal) was found to be 4.3 ± 0.6 (n = 3) on day 2 and 7.0 ± 0.2 (n = 4) on day 3 following treatment with RA. The amount of the JNK itself, in contrast, was found to be relatively constant over the time frame of the induction of differentiation, whereas the activity of JNK was markedly enhanced. These data demonstrate among the various MAP kinases that JNK is markedly activated in the P19 cells induced to endoderm by RA, p38 activities increase little, and ERK1,2 activities show a modest decline. Anisomycin is a potent activator of JNK activity (15Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Ruble E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar) and was employed to explore the nature of the activation of JNK that accompanies RA treatment (Fig. 3). P19 cells were incubated with or without anisomycin (100 ng/ml) for 2 h, and the JNK was immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts and the kinase activity measured using the solid-state assay (Fig. 3 A). Anisomycin proved to be a potent stimulator of JNK, increasing JNK activity by more than 3-fold within 2 h of stimulation. The stimulation by anisomycin was reversible, simply removing the anisomycin precipitated a return to base line of the JNK activity in cells treated with anisomycin, washed free of the agent, and measured 1 day later (Fig. 3 A). Anisomycin treatment alone was not able to induce the loss of SSEA-1 antigen nor positive staining by TROMA. The same situation was not observed with regard to the ability of RA to induce differentiation and activation of JNK in the P19 cells (Fig.3 B). Treating cells with 100 nm RA activates JNK by at least 6-fold by day 5, whether the RA is included throughout the 5-day period or added only for the first 2 of the 5-day treatment. The RA-induced increase in JNK activity is sustained following disruption of P19 cell aggregates, harvest, and re-plating of the cells (data not shown). These data suggest a fundamental difference in the activation of JNK by RA as compared with anisomycin. Commitment to the differentiated state or activation of JNK observed in response to RA in the first 2 days continues well beyond the presence of the RA, much like the expression of Gα12 and Gα13induced by RA in P19 cells (39Jho E. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RA treatment increases the expression of Gα12 and Gα13 in P19 cells (39Jho E. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Both Gα12 and Gα13 have been shown to mediate signals that act on downstream MAP kinases, particularly JNK (16Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Faure M.P. Ahn N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21081-21087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 40Collins L.R. Minden A. Karin M. Brown J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18655-18659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Taken together these observations stimulated us to examine the relationship between Gα12 and Gα13 levels in P19 cells and the activity of JNK (Fig. 4). P19 cells stably expressing mutant forms of either Gα12 (Q226L) or Gα13 (Q229L) that are constitutively active were probed with respect to JNK activation, in the absence of RA treatment. Expression of either Q226LGα12 or Q229LGα13in P19 cells resulted in the activation of JNK activity in the absence of RA treatment. Cells expressing Q226LGα12 displayed activation of JNK activity ranging from 1.9- to 2.7-fold over basal levels. P19 cells expressing Q229LGα13 displayed activation of JNK activity ranging from 2.4- to 3.8-fold over basal (Fig. 4). In the absence of RA treatment, P19 cells expressing Q229LGα13 have been shown to differentiate to the endodermal phenotype (39Jho E. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Expression of Q226LGα12induces the differentiation from embryonal phenotype and loss of positive staining for the SSEA-1 embryonic-specific marker but not to endodermal-like phenotype (39Jho E. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with a role for Gα12 and Gα13 controlling aspects of differentiation induced by morphogens (38Kemler R. Brulet P. Schnebelen M. Gaillard J. Jacob F. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1981; 64: 45-60PubMed Google Scholar) but go further to demonstrate a potential role for activation of the MAP kinase regulatory network, and specifically JNK, by RA. The linkage between expression of Gα12 and Gα13 and JNK activity in differentiating P19 cells was approached from the opposite perspective, i.e. suppression of Gα12 and Gα13 with RNA antisense to each. Previously we demonstrated the suppression of either Gα12 or Gα13 in stable transfectants of P19 cells using the pLNCX vector (39Jho E. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Suppression of Gα12was 50–70% in clones expressing RNA antisense to Gα12(39Jho E. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas induction of JNK activity upon RA treatment in those clones was attenuated significantly in comparison to clones harboring the empty vector (Fig. 5) or to wild-type cells (Fig. 2 C). The same basic observations were true for the clones in which RNA antisense to Gα13 suppressed Gα13 levels 60–80%, and induction of JNK activity upon RA treatment was found to be reduced by approximately half. Thus, expression of constitutively active forms of Gα12 and Gα13 results in constitutively elevated basal levels of JNK activity, whereas suppression of Gα12 and Gα13 results in constitutively attenuated induction of JNK activity upon RA treatment. To test further the linkages among Gα12 and Gα13, JNK activation and induction of differentiation by RA, we stably expressed a dominant negative mutant form of JNK1 (JNK1 (APF)) in P19 cells and examined JNK activity of the clones in the absence and presence of RA (Fig.6 A). Densitometric scanning of immunoblots reveals that the total level of JNK1 immunoreactivity increased about 50% in the cells stably expressing the immunoreactive, dominant negative form of JNK1 (not shown). The FLAG-tagged, dominant negative form of JNK1 was readily detected in the cells transfected with the vector harboring JNK1 (APF) with antibodies specific to the tag epitope (not shown). More importantly, expression of negative dominant JNK1 was observed to block completely the activation of JNK1 activity by RA, although slightly increasing the apparent level of JNK basal activity (Fig. 6 A). Thus, expression of dominant negative JNK abolishes the ability of RA to activate JNK. To test the ability of the dominant negative to block endogenous JNK1 activity, we probed activity of JNK following anisomycin activation in cells stably expressing either pCMV vector alone or pCMV vector harboring JNK1 (APF). Upon treatment with 200 ng/ml anisomycin, control cells displayed a 15-fold activation of JNK over basal levels, whereas cells expressing the dominant negative showed a 4-fold activation (Fig.7 B). These data strongly suggest that induction of JNK activity is a causal effect for differentiation rather than result of differentiation. The capacity to abolish the activation of JNK in response to RA by expressing the dominant negative form of JNK1 provided the opportunity to address directly if the activation of JNK is critical to the ability of RA to induce differentiation of the embryonal P19 cells. Clones harboring the empty vector (pCMV) as well as those expressing the dominant negative version of JNK1 were both treated with RA for 3 days and then stained with antibody to the embryonic-specific marker SSEA-1 (Fig. 7). When treated with RA, clones harboring the empty vector differentiated to the endodermal phenotype just as wild-type P19 cells (Fig. 1), displaying negative staining for the embryonal marker antigen, SSEA-1 (Fig. 7). Clones expressing the dominant negative from of JNK1, in contrast, stain positive for the embryonal marker in the absence or presence of RA. These data demonstrate an obligate role for JNK1 activation in the differentiation of P19 cells to endoderm stimulated by RA. P19 embryonal carcinoma cells are an attractive model for the study of differentiation, displaying a capacity to differentiate to endoderm, neuroectoderm, and beating cardiac myocytes under the appropriate culture conditions (29Jones-Villeneuve E.M.V. Rudincki M.A. Harris J.F. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2271-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 30Bain G. Ray W.J. Yao M. Gottlieb D.I. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The P19 cell line was adopted for the study of the role of heterotrimeric G-protein subunits Gα12 and Gα13 as well as MAP kinases in the differentiation of these embryonal cells to endoderm in response to RA. Gα12 and Gα13 are expressed in P19 cells, and their levels of expression are increased in response to RA (39Jho E. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of the constitutively active mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 provoke differentiation from the embryonal phenotype in the absence of RA (39Jho E. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The role of heterotrimeric G-proteins in the regulation of the MAP kinase regulatory network has been appreciated recently, and the current study illuminates the role of Gα12 and Gα13 in differentiation mediated via specific activation of JNK but neither ERK1,2 nor p38. The JNK pathway is required for embryonic viability (42Yang D. Tournier C. Wysk M. Lu H.-T. Xu J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice in which the gene for MKK4, the upstream activator of JNK, has been interrupted die prior to day 11 of embryonic development (42Yang D. Tournier C. Wysk M. Lu H.-T. Xu J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This lack of viability is consistent with a role of JNK in mammalian development, perhaps differentiation (42Yang D. Tournier C. Wysk M. Lu H.-T. Xu J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). InDrosophila, the JNK pathway is required for embryonic development (43Riesgo-Escovar J.R. Jenni M. Fritz A. Hafen E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2759-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 44Sluss H.K. Han Z. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Ip T.

Embryonic death occurs because of a failure of the migration of the dorsal epithelial cells required for dorsal closure. The early nature of this defect precludes analysis of the role of JNK in differentiation in this system (43Riesgo-Escovar J.R. Jenni M. Fritz A. Hafen E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2759-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 44Sluss H.K. Han Z. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Ip T.

The most compelling evidence for the role of JNK1 in P19 embryonal cell differentiation was the ability of the dominant negative mutant of JNK1 to block endodermal differentiation in response to RA. Perhaps these heterotrimeric G-proteins activate JNK via known downstream elements (46Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar) or perhaps through a tyrosine kinase that is regulated directly by G-proteins, as recently reported in an avian lymphocyte cell line (47Wan Y. Kurosaki T. Huang X.-Y. Nature. 1996; 380: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2059334340,"Bik is a potent pro-apoptotic protein, which complexes with various anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, 19-kDa adenovirus E1B, and EBV-BHRF1. The mechanism by which Bik promotes cell death is not known. It shares a conserved domain, BH3, with other pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax, Bak, Bid, and Hrk, and certain anti-apoptosis proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Mutations within the BH3 domain of Bik abrogate its ability to induce cell death and to complex with anti-apoptosis proteins. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that Bik may promote cell death by complexing with and antagonizing the activity of endogenous cellular anti-apoptosis proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. To elucidate the relationship between protein complex formation and induction of cell death, we have identified the minimal sequences of Bik, from a library of N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutants, required for interaction with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and for inducing efficient cell death. Two-hybrid analysis in yeast and immunoprecipitation analysis of proteins expressed in mammalian cells indicate that a 52-amino acid region (amino acids 43–94) of Bik, encompassing the BH3 domain, is sufficient for efficient heterodimerization with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Protein interaction studies further reveal that an 18-amino acid region, encompassing the BH3 domain (residues 57–74), constitutes the core heterodimerization domain. Functional analysis indicates that a Bik deletion mutant expressing residues 43–120, which efficiently heterodimerizes with the anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, is defective in eliciting cell death. In contrast, a mutant expressing additional C-terminal sequences (amino acids 43–134) interacts with the survival proteins and elicits efficient cell death. Our results suggest that for Bik-mediated cell death, the heterodimerization activity encoded by the BH3 domain alone is insufficient and raise the possibility that Bik may induce cell death autonomous of heterodimerization with survival proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL.

Apoptosis is a normal physiological process required for selective elimination of cells in multicellular organisms. This process is either positively or negatively modulated by a number of external and internal factors. The bcl-2 proto-oncogene is a well known inhibitor of apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 1Reed J.C.

Recently, a number of vertebrate cellular and viral proteins structurally related to Bcl-2 have been identified. The various Bcl-2 homologs have been shown to possess either anti-apoptotic or pro-apoptotic activity. The pro-apoptotic homologs include Bax (3Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1638-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), which function as dominant death inducers when overexpressed. The mechanism(s) by which anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins elicit their respective activities are not known. A common feature of the various Bcl-2 family members is that they form homo- and heterodimeric complexes (3Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5820) Google Scholar, 11Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J.

A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, it has been proposed that anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 promote cell survival by complexing with pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax, thereby antagonizing the death-promoting activity of these proteins (3Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5820) Google Scholar, 11Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). However, it has recently been observed that certain mutants of Bcl-xL, defective in complex formation with Bax and Bak, are still able to promote cell survival (13Cheng E.H. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that at least certain anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins may promote cell survival independently of their interaction with known pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bak. The pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak are closely related to Bcl-2 whereas Bik is more distantly related. Bax and Bak contain three conserved domains, BH1, BH2, and BH3, similar to Bcl-2, in addition to the characteristic C-terminal transmembrane domain common to all Bcl-2 family proteins. In contrast, Bik shares only the BH3 and the C-terminal transmembrane domains with other Bcl-2 family proteins. The presence of the BH3 domain in Bik, which is otherwise unrelated to Bax and Bak, suggests a critical role for the BH3 domain in the common cell death-inducing activity of the three different proteins. The dual role of the BH3 domain in inducing cell death and mediating heterodimerization with survival proteins was elucidated by detailed mutagenesis of Bak, where a minigene encoding a 51-amino acid region, encompassing the BH3 domain, was found to be sufficient for inducing cell death and for heterodimerization with Bcl-xL (14Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Further, mutations within the BH3 domain of Bak, Bax, and Bik were found to abrogate the ability of these proteins to heterodimerize with the survival proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and to eliminate their apoptotic activity (7Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chittenden T.

Like Bik, two recently identified pro-apoptotic proteins, Bid (9Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Millman C.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) and Hrk (10Inohara N. Ding L. Chen D. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1638-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), that complex with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL share only the BH3 domain with other Bcl-2 family members. Thus, the two activities (i.e. heterodimerization with survival proteins and induction of cell death) of Bax, Bak, Bik, Bid, and Hrk mediated by the BH3 domain appear to be linked. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that these pro-apoptotic proteins promote cell death by complexing with endogenous survival proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. The results presented in this report suggest that complex formation of Bik with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL alone is insufficient for promoting cell death. Efficient Bik-mediated cell death requires additional sequence elements, in addition to the conserved BH3 domain. To construct N-terminal deletion mutants of Bik, the plasmid pACT-Bik (7Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar) was linearized with BamHI, treated with Bal-31 nuclease (Life Technologies, Inc.) for various lengths of time, and then digested with SalI (3′ end of Bik cDNA). DNA fragments were isolated by agarose electrophoresis and ligated with the vector pACT (between BamHI (blunt ended with T4 DNA polymerase) and SalI sites). The ligated DNA was introduced into Escherichia coli DH5α by electroporation. Transformed colonies (∼103) were pooled by scraping and amplified for purification of library DNA. To construct C-terminal deletion mutants of Bik, pACT-Bik was linearized with SmaI (located near the 3′ end of the Bik open reading frame) and digested with Bal-31 and then with BamHI. DNA fragments were purified and ligated to pACT (between SalI (blunt ended) andBamHI sites) and cloned. Yeast indicator strain GGY1::171 was transformed with the bait plasmid expressing a fusion protein consisting of the human Bcl-2 protein tagged with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (pMA424-Bcl2; Ref. 15Boyd J.M.

BSC40 or MCF-7 cells were infected with vaccinia virus vTF7–3 (10 plaque-forming units/cell) and cotransfected with 3 μg of each plasmid (pcDNA3-based) expressing Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (18Boise L.H.

The cells were labeled with [35S]methionine mix (150 μCi/ml) in methionine-free medium (20–22 h postinfection) and lysed with TNN buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The HA epitope-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated and resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The expression of Bcl-2 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-Bcl-2 antibody, 4D7 (Pharmingen) whereas Bcl-xL expression (tagged with the Flag epitope) was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-Flag antibody (Kodak). MCF-7 cells were transfected with HA epitope-tagged Bik or Bik mutants (2 μg) expressed from the pcDNA3 vector along with the reporter plasmid pRSV-βgal (0.5 μg). After 9–10 h of transfection, the cells were fixed, stained with X-gal, and microscopically examined. 100–200 blue color cells were microscopically scored as flat (live) and round (apoptotic) cells. To determine the minimal sequences of Bik required for interaction with anti-apoptosis proteins, we used a library of N-terminal deletion mutants of Bik generated by Bal-31 nuclease digestion. The mutants competent for interaction with Bcl-2 were identified by two-hybrid analysis in yeast (13Cheng E.H. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Yeast colonies expressing the positively interacting bik mutants were identified on the basis of activation of expression of the lacZ reporter gene. The level of interaction was assessed from the intensity of blue color in the X-gal filter β-galactosidase assay. Ten different yeast colonies that showed intense blue color in the X-gal assay were randomly selected, and the pACT-Bik plasmids were recovered by bacterial transformation. DNA sequence analysis of these mutants revealed four different N-terminal end points starting at codons 29, 34, 38, and 43 (Fig. 1,b–e). The relative levels of interaction of these deletion mutants were more or less similar to that of wt Bik (Fig.1 a). To determine if additional sequences at the N-terminal region could be deleted without abolishing interaction with Bcl-2, a different bik mutant library was prepared after more extensive digestion with Bal-31 nuclease and analyzed by two-hybrid assay. Most of the yeast colonies resulting from transformation of this library and the Bcl-2 bait were white in the X-gal assay indicating lack of interaction. However, two weakly interacting clones (which showed less intense blue color in the X-gal assay) were identified. DNA sequence analysis of these bik clones revealed that both clones had a single N-terminal end at codon 57 (Fig. 1 f). These results indicate that residue 57 defines the N terminus of the minimal Bik protein required for heterodimerization with Bcl-2 whereas additional residues up to 43 amino acids are required for more efficient interaction. To determine the C-terminal boundary, a similar Bal-31 nuclease-mediated deletion mutagenesis of pACT-Bik (wt) was performed, and the products were analyzed for interaction by two-hybrid analysis. Among the positively interacting clones, 18 were sequenced and 4 were chosen for further analysis. These clones had C-terminal ends at residues 96, 82, 78, and 74 (Fig. 1, g–j). Among the four mutants, mutant j (Fig. 1 j) was interesting since it had the largest deletion and interacted with Bcl-2 better than mutant i. However, mutant j contained an additional 21 missense amino acids (unrelated to Bik, resulting from mutagenesis and cloning) at the C terminus compared with mutant i, which had only four missense amino acids. To determine if a truncation mutant of Bik with an additional deletion of the C-terminal sequences can interact with Bcl-2, a different mutant of pACT-Bik expressing the N-terminal 72 amino acids was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and analyzed for heterodimerization (Fig. 1 k). This truncation mutant was defective in interaction with Bcl-2, suggesting that an additional C-terminal sequence is required for BH3-mediated interaction with Bcl-2. These results indicate that Bik residues 57–74 may constitute the core heterodimerization motif and that additional flanking sequences are required to facilitate heterodimerization with Bcl-2. To identify the minimal domain of Bik that interacts with Bcl-2 efficiently, we introduced three different C-terminal truncation mutations by polymerase chain reaction in the N-terminal deletion mutant 43–160. Interaction of the three mutants with Bcl-2 was determined by two-hybrid analysis. These two-hybrid analyses indicated that two of these mutants, 43–134 (Fig. 1 l) and 43–120 (Fig. 1 m), interacted with Bcl-2 as strongly as the parental 43–160 mutant whereas the third mutant 43–94 (Fig. 1 n) interacted at a reduced level. As expected, a deletion mutation (ΔGD) within the BH3 domain of Bik mutants 43–94 (Fig. 1 o) and 43–120 (Fig. 1 p) abolished their interaction with Bcl-2 underscoring the requirement of the BH3 domain for heterodimerization. The ability of the three deletion mutants, 43–94, 43–120, and 43–134, to heterodimerize with cellular anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and BclxL was investigated by coimmunoprecipitation analysis in mammalian cells. For this purpose, the wt Bik and mutants were tagged with the HA epitope and coexpressed with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL in BSC40 cells using the vaccinia virus expression system (19Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar). The proteins were immunoprecipitated with the HA antibody or the antibody specific for the survival proteins. In these studies, Bik mutants with deletions in the BH3 domain (ΔGD) were used as the negative control. As shown in Fig.2 A, Bcl-2 is coimmunoprecipitated with full-length HA-Bik as well as with the Bik deletion mutants HA-Bik(43–134) and HA-Bik(43–120) when the protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with the HA monoclonal antibody. Although the expression of the mutant HA-Bik-(43–94) was generally poor (compared with other mutants), it was also found to complex with Bcl-2 at detectable levels. It should be noted that expression of the various Bik mutants in the absence of Bcl-2 was generally lower than in cells expressing Bcl-2. It is possible the protein heterodimerization may stabilize the mutant proteins. As expected, there was no significant coprecipitation of Bcl-2 with the HA-BikΔGD (BH3) mutant, suggesting that the interaction is specific. Similarly, HA antibody did not precipitate Bcl-2 from cells that were not transfected with Bik expression vectors. These results indicate that all three deletion mutants of Bik can form a complex with Bcl-2 in mammalian cells and are in good agreement with the two-hybrid data. Similar coimmunoprecipitation studies were also carried out with extracts from cells transfected with Bcl-xL (tagged with Flag epitope) and Bik (Fig. 2 B). In general, the relative level of interaction between Bik and Bcl-xL was stronger. Coexpression of HA-Bik wt or the various HA-Bik mutants with Bcl-xL resulted in highly efficient coprecipitation, and in contrast, coexpression with the BikΔGD mutant did not result in detectable amounts of Bcl-xL coprecipitation. Interestingly, coexpression of the Bik mutants with Bcl-xLresulted in high levels of Bik expression. These results indicate that all three deletion mutants of Bik efficiently heterodimerize with Bcl-xL. To determine if the two activities of Bik (i.e. ability to heterodimerize with survival proteins and to induce cell death) can be separated, we then determined the apoptotic activities of the threebik mutants by transient DNA transfection (14Chittenden T.

Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar) in MCF-7 cells. Expression of wt Bik resulted in about 80% apoptotic cells among the transfected cells (Fig.3 A). Similarly, expression of the mutant 43–134 induced cell death at levels comparable with that ofwt Bik. In contrast, cells transfected with the corresponding mutant constructs containing the BH3 deletion (ΔGD) mutation did not exhibit significantly higher frequency of cell death compared with cells transfected with the pcDNA3-HA vector. Interestingly, the heterodimerization-positive mutants 43–120 and 43–94 (as well as their derivatives containing the ΔGD mutation) were defective in induction of cell death. To resolve if the defect in induction of cell death by mutants 43–120 and 43–94 is not due to lack of mutant Bik protein expression in MCF-7 cells, we examined the expression of mutant proteins by immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 3 B). Although mutant 43–94 was expressed at relatively low levels, mutant 43–120 was expressed at significant levels. Since cells transfected with the mutant 43–120 do not exhibit any higher cell death compared with cells transfected with the pcDNA3-HA vector, it appears that additional sequences encompassing residues 121–134 are essential for efficient Bik-mediated cell death. The requirement of amino acids (aa) 121–134 for Bik-induced cell death was also confirmed using a different Bik mutant (Δ121–134) containing an internal deletion of residues 121–134 within Bik43–160 (Figs. 4 B and5). A data bank search revealed that this region is significantly homologous to the substrate binding pocket (position P4) domain of Ced-3/ICE family caspases (22Walker N.P.C. Talanian R.V. Brady K.D.

To determine the role of this motif in Bik-induced cell, we introduced a deletion mutation (ΔWW; residues 122–130) within the death-inducing Bik truncation mutant 43–134. Similarly, a different two-amino acid substitution mutant (R123A/S129A) was also constructed (Fig. 4 B). The cell death activity of these mutants was determined by transient transfection. Deletion of the entire pocket motif impaired the death activity of Bik(43–134) by about one-half, and mutation of the conserved Arg123 and Ser129 residues (R123A/S129A) resulted in modest reduction in the cell death activity compared with Bik-(43–134). These results suggest that the sequences encompassing residues 121–134 are required for efficient Bik-mediated cell death, and the sequence motif similar to the substrate binding pocket of Ced-3/ICE caspases may constitute part of these sequences.Figure 5Induction of apoptosis by Bik C-terminal mutants.

These studies indicate that a 52-amino acid region encompassing the BH3 domain of Bik is sufficient for heterodimerization with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. This result is in good agreement with the results obtained with two other cell death-inducing proteins Bak (14Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and Bax (21Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In the case of Bak, a 51-amino acid region (aa 73–123), and in the case of Bax, a 43-amino acid region (aa 59–101), both proteins encompassing the BH3 domain have been shown to be sufficient for heterodimerization with Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, respectively. Since our two-hybrid analysis indicates that a 18-amino acid region located between residues 57 and 74 mediates heterodimerization, the adjoining sequences may play a facilitating role. Recent in vitro peptide binding studies indicate that 16-amino acid regions encompassing the BH3 domains of Bak, Bax, and Bik can bind with Bcl-xL (24Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P.

The results of these in vitro studies are in good agreement with the data from our two-hybrid analysis. An important outcome of our present studies is the identification of mutants of Bik (e.g. Bik-(43–94) and Bik-(43–120)) that heterodimerize with cellular anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and are unable to induce efficient cell death. Previous studies have indicated that the cell death activities of Bak, Bax, and Bik are closely linked with their ability to heterodimerize with survival proteins (7Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5589-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutations within the BH3 domain of two recently identified pro-apoptotic proteins Bid (9Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Millman C.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) and Hrk (10Inohara N. Ding L. Chen D. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1638-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) impair their ability to heterodimerize with survival proteins and to induce cell death. These results are consistent with a model that the five different pro-apoptotic proteins may mediate cell death by complexing with endogenous survival proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Our present results indicate that interaction of Bik with anti-apoptosis proteins alone is insufficient for induction of cell death by Bik. Although we cannot rule out that the death-promoting activity of Bik is dependent on its interaction with cellular anti-apoptosis proteins, our results would be consistent with a model that Bik promotes cell death independently of such interaction. Our present results also indicate that sequences of Bik encompassing a C-terminal region (aa 120–134) are required (in addition to the BH3 domain) for efficient cell death activity in MCF-7 cells. These sequences are not conserved in other pro-apoptotic members such as Bax, Bak, Bid, and Hrk. Since the BH3 domain plays a central role in mediating cell death by the various pro-apoptotic members, it is possible that in Bik, the C-terminal sequences may function in concert with the BH3 domain whereas in other pro-apoptotic proteins, the BH3 domain may function more autonomously or in concert with other yet unknown auxiliary sequence elements. The precise biochemical activity of the C-terminal region of Bik is not known. Although this region contains a sequence motif similar to the substrate binding motif of Ced-3/ICE family caspases, it remains to be determined if this motif modulates the substrate-caspase complexes. Simpler explanations such as the C-terminal region playing a role in Bik protein folding are also possible. We thank V. M. Dixit and A. M. Chinnaiyan for MCF-7 cells."

Schütz G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1430-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The hepatocyte injuries seen in HT1 patients have not been evidenced in these mice, but ultrastructural investigations on these lethal albino mice revealed altered membranous components of hepatocytes in the perinatal period (9Kelsey G. Ruppert S. Schedl A. Schmid E. Thies E. Schütz G. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1992; 16: 117-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heretofore, available mouse models of HT1 did not demonstrate progressive liver damage and did not allow for examinations of effects of the tyrosine catabolic pathway on mature and unmodified hepatocytes with the FAH defect. In this study, we asked if homozygous null mutation of theHpd gene would rescue the homozygousc 14CoS mice (c14CoS/c 14CoS orFah −/−) (5Gluecksohn-Waelsch S.

HPD catalyzes a complex reaction to form homogentisate from 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The homozygous mutant Hpd allele from mouse strainIII is expected to completely block tyrosine catabolism (13Endo F. Katoh H. Yamamoto S. Matsuda I. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 704-709PubMed Google Scholar, 14Katoh H. Endo F. Suzuki K. Matsuda I. Mouse Genome. 1991; 89: 572Google Scholar, 15Endo F. Awata H. Katoh H. Matsuda I. Genomics. 1995; 25: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As the formation of homogentisate exclusively depends on HPD activity, a complete block of tyrosine catabolism at this step would result in deprivation of homogentisate and its oxidative products. The outcome of the double mutants (Fah −/− Hpd −/−) itself is important for evaluating treatment strategies (4Lindstedt S. Holme E. Lock E.A. Hjalmarson O. Strandvik B. Lancet. 1992; 340: 813-817Abstract PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) and for understanding the mechanism of the related carcinogenesis (1Mitchell G.A. Lambert M. Tanguay R.M. Scriver C.R.

We report here that blocking of tyrosine catabolism concealed the liver damage in lethal albino deletion c 14CoS mice. Retrieval of the tyrosine catabolic pathway in the double mutants byin vivo gene transfer or by injection of homogentisate resulted in apoptotic death of the hepatocytes. These observations provide new insights into the disease process of HT1. This model will aid in assessing and developing treatments for HT1 patients. Heterozygousc 14CoS (Fah +/−) mice (kindly provided by G. Schütz) were crossed with homozygousIII mice (Hpd −/−), followed by the breeding of F1 × homozygous III mice. Mice with the genotype Fah +/− Hpd −/−were identified and used for the next breeding for generation ofFah −/− Hpd −/− mice. Heterozygotes for the Fah − allele (Fah +/−) were identified by Southern blots using the RN.Fd probe (a gift from G. Schütz) as described (8Ruppert S. Kelsey G. Schedl A. Schmid E. Thies E. Schütz G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1430-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,9Kelsey G. Ruppert S. Schedl A. Schmid E. Thies E. Schütz G. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1992; 16: 117-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygotes for the Fah − allele (Fah −/−) were identified by the absence of exon 2 sequences and the presence of exon 8 sequences of theFah gene after PCR amplification of regions containing each exon, respectively. The sequences of sense and antisense primers for PCR amplification of the regions of the mouse Fah gene were derived from the published cDNA sequence (12Klebig M.L. Russell L.B. Rinchik E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1363-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Primer sets used for PCR amplifications were as follows (sense/antisense): a set forFah gene exon 2, 5′-CCAAAGCCACGGATTGGTGT-3′/5′-TCATCGAAGACATGTTGATG; and a set forFah gene exon 8, 5′-CACGAGACATCCAGCAATGG-3′/5′-CTGCTTTGGGTTTGGCACCA-3′. TheHpd − allele was identified as described previously (15Endo F. Awata H. Katoh H. Matsuda I. Genomics. 1995; 25: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis on agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Liver samples were quick-frozen in dry ice and kept at −70 °C until use. The tissues were homogenized in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (7.5 μg of protein) was subjected to SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting of HPD and FAH was carried out with antiserum directed against recombinant human HPD and FAH, respectively. Rabbits were immunized with glutationeS-transferase-human FAH and glutationeS-transferase-human HPD for production of antibodies, respectively. 2F. Endo, S. Kubo, H. Awata, and I.

Awata H. Tanoue A. Ishiguro M. Eda Y. Titani K. Matsuda I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24235-24240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amounts of protein were determined by the Bio-Rad dye binding method. Hepatic HPD activity was measured as described previously (19Kubo S. Kiwaki K. Awata H. Katoh H. Kanegae Y. Saito I. Yamamoto T. Matsuda I. Endo F. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A replication-defective recombinant adenovirus, human adenovirus type 5 lacking the E1A, E1B, and E3 regions and bearing a human HPD expression unit in the E1-deleted region, was prepared as described (20Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Transcriptional orientation of the expression cassette is leftward, opposite the original orientation of E1A and E1B genes. A BamHI-SalI fragment of human HPD cDNA was prepared as described (18Endo F. Awata H. Tanoue A. Ishiguro M. Eda Y. Titani K. Matsuda I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24235-24240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted. Expression of HPD is driven by the CAG promoter, which consists of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer and the chicken β-actin/rabbit β-globin hybrid promoter containing rabbit β-globin 3′-flanking sequences, including a polyadenylation signal (21Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar). The adenovirus was purified and titrated as described (22Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 23Kanegae Y. Makimura M. Saito I. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1994; 47: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and injected into the tail veins of the mice. Liver specimens were isolated before and after injection of the recombinant adenovirus, snap-frozen and kept at −80 °C until use. A recombinant adenovirus, AdexCAGhOTC, which efficiently expresses human ornithine transcarbamylase in mouse liver when injected into the tail vein, was prepared as described previously (24Kiwaki K. Kanegae Y. Saito I. Komaki S. Nakamura K. Miyazaki J. Endo F. Matsuda I. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The effects of the intravenous administration of AdexCAGhOTC on the livers of C57BL/6 mice and ornithine transcarbamylase-deficient mice (spf ash) were characterized (24Kiwaki K. Kanegae Y. Saito I. Komaki S. Nakamura K. Miyazaki J. Endo F. Matsuda I. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For hematoxylin-eosin staining, livers were fixed in vivo by circulating 2% neutralized paraformaldehyde solution without treatment or after the administration of AdexCAGhHPD or homogentisate. For electron microscopic investigation, a small piece of the liver was removed (12 h after homogentisate had been injected) and fixed in glutaraldehyde. The 3′-OH DNA ends generated by DNA fragmentation were detected by in situ terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-dioxygenin nick end labeling assay (25Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9144) Google Scholar) using a kit from Oncor (Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer. The livers of treated animals were excised at 24 h after the administration of the recombinant adenovirus (5 × 108 pfu) or 12 h after injection of homogentisate and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Nuclear DNA was prepared as described (25Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9144) Google Scholar) and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel. Serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine were measured using an automated analyzer. Blood tyrosine levels were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography using a column for neutral amino acids and dried blood spots as samples, as described (19Kubo S. Kiwaki K. Awata H. Katoh H. Kanegae Y. Saito I. Yamamoto T. Matsuda I. Endo F. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Urinary concentrations of succinylacetone were determined by stable isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assay as described (26Jakobs C. Dorland L. Wikkerink B. Kok R.M. de Jong A.P.J.M. Wadman S.K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1988; 223: 223-232Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The mutant Hpd allele (Hpd −) is from mouse strain III(Hpd −/−) (13Endo F. Katoh H. Yamamoto S. Matsuda I. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 704-709PubMed Google Scholar, 14Katoh H. Endo F. Suzuki K. Matsuda I. Mouse Genome. 1991; 89: 572Google Scholar, 15Endo F. Awata H. Katoh H. Matsuda I. Genomics. 1995; 25: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a model for human hereditary tyrosinemia type 3 (27Endo F. Kitano A. Uehara I. Nagata N. Matsuda I. Shinka T. Kuhara T. Matsumoto I. Pediatr. Res. 1983; 16: 92-96Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that is characterized by elevation of blood tyrosine and the absence of visceral injuries (13Endo F. Katoh H. Yamamoto S. Matsuda I. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 704-709PubMed Google Scholar, 27Endo F. Kitano A. Uehara I. Nagata N. Matsuda I. Shinka T. Kuhara T. Matsumoto I. Pediatr. Res. 1983; 16: 92-96Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). There is a C to T transition at nucleotide +7 on exon 7 of the Hpdgene on chromosome 5 of the III mouse, the result being premature termination of translation (15Endo F. Awata H. Katoh H. Matsuda I. Genomics. 1995; 25: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This stop codon mutation was associated with the skipping of exon 7 in its mRNA (15Endo F. Awata H. Katoh H. Matsuda I. Genomics. 1995; 25: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The transcript with the termination codon has not been obtained by reverse transcription-amplification of RNA from the liver (15Endo F. Awata H. Katoh H. Matsuda I. Genomics. 1995; 25: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, the amount of the 14-kDa polypeptide that was synthesized from mRNA with the stop codon mutation appears to be negligible. On the other hand, the abnormally spliced transcript can be translated into a 36-kDa protein lacking the central part of the subunit of HPD. This 36-kDa protein seemed to be unstable. As a result, protein immunologically related to HPD was absent in III mouse liver. Genotyping of the pups revealed that the double mutants (Fah −/− Hpd −/−) survived and grew well (Fig. 1,A and B). Analysis of liver biopsy samples confirmed that FAH and HPD proteins were absent in these mice (Fig.1 C). The clinical phenotype ofFah −/− Hpd −/− mice was indistinguishable from those ofFah +/− Hpd −/− andFah +/+ Hpd −/− mice. The findings in liver sections from Fah −/− Hpd −/− mice (Fig.2 A) were normal and similar to those from Fah +/− Hpd −/− and III mice. Long-term investigations of Fah −/− Hpd −/− mice (12–18 months) revealed no evidence of hepatocellular carcinomas or preneoplastic lesions. Thus, the homozygous mutant Hpd allele from the III mouse not only rescued the lethal phenotype ofFah −/− mice, but also concealed the critical visceral phenotype of HT1.Figure 2Histological appearance of lesions induced inFah −/− Hpd −/− mice by adenovirus-mediated expression of HPD or homogentisate injection. a, liver section from an untreatedFah −/− Hpd −/− mouse (8 months old) showing a normal structure and no hepatocyte injury (hematoxylin eosin × 400). b, liver section from anFah −/− Hpd −/− mouse administered 5 × 108 pfu of AdexCAGhHPD (hematoxylin eosin × 400).

At first, we attempted to retrieve the tyrosine catabolic pathway in these mice, as achieved by adenovirus-mediated in vivo expression of HPD in hepatocytes. Injection of the recombinant virus AdexCAGhHPD into the tail veins of the control mice (Fah +/− Hpd −/−) resulted in expression of HPD in the liver (Fig. 1 D) and was accompanied by a reduction in blood tyrosine levels. No animal injected with 5 × 108 pfu of AdexCAGhHPD was lost in the control experiments using C57BL/6, Fah +/− Hpd −/−, or III mice, except for oneIII mouse, which died within 1 h after the injection (Table I). The death of theIII mouse seemed to be caused by direct reaction to the infusion. When 5 × 108 pfu of AdexCAGhHPD was injected into Fah −/− Hpd −/− mice via the tail veins, blood tyrosine levels were reduced (from 21.4 ± 3.4 to 3.2 ± 1.6 mg/dl at 9 h after injection), and HPD protein appeared in the liver (Fig.1 D), but all the mice died within 30 h (range of 14–30 h) (Table I). Although a recombinant virus carrying mutant HPD would be the best control virus, we used a recombinant adenovirus, AdexCAGhOTC, which expresses an unrelated protein. In control experiments, when AdexCAGhOTC (5 × 108 pfu), which efficiently expresses human ornithine transcarbamylase in mouse liver when injected into the tail vein (24Kiwaki K. Kanegae Y. Saito I. Komaki S. Nakamura K. Miyazaki J. Endo F. Matsuda I. Hum.

The HPD activity was not detected in the original III mice (Fah +/+ Hpd −/−) and in Fah −/− Hpd −/− mice. The administration of AdexCAGhHPD intoIII mice resulted in a rapid increase in hepatic HPD activity, reaching levels in the wild type as early as 6–12 h after administration (19Kubo S. Kiwaki K.

In the present study, livers were excised 6 h after the administration of AdexCAGhHPD, and HPD activities in the liver were measured. These results indicated that the activities in treated Fah −/− Hpd −/−mice were similar to those in treatedFah +/+ Hpd −/− mice.Table IILiver activities of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase in mice treated with recombinant adenovirus AdexCAGhHPDMice and treatmentsHPD activity (mean ± S.D.)microunits/mg proteinC57BL6 (Fah +/+ Hpd +/+) (n = 5)190.1 ± 15.3III(Fah +/+ Hpd −/−) (n = 4)<5.0Double mutant (Fah −/− Hpd −/−) (n = 4)<5.0III(Fah +/+ Hpd −/−), treated with AdexCAGhHPD (6 h after treatment; n = 4)125.3 ± 24.1Double mutant (Fah −/− Hpd −/−), treated with AdexCAGhHP (6 h after treatment; n = 4)100.3 ± 18.6HPD activities were measured as described using a radioisotope (see “Experimental Procedures”). Open table in a new tab HPD activities were measured as described using a radioisotope (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fah −/− Hpd −/− mice treated with AdexCAGhHPD were definitely ill from 12 h after the injection, and mobility was reduced and appetite lost. These animals died within 30 h after injection of the recombinant virus (TableI). In control experiments, we injected AdexCAGhOTC into the tail veins of Fah +/− Hpd −/−,III, or C57BL/6 mice; however, there were no significant changes in the clinical symptoms of these mice, and none were lost (Table I). In liver sections obtained from the AdexCAGhHPD-treatedFah −/− Hpd −/− mice, massive numbers of hepatocytes were nonviable. There was no infiltration of inflammatory cells, but there were small areas of bleeding (Fig. 2 b). The damaged cells showed evidence of chromatic condensation.

The proteolipid is a major component of Vo, and chemical modification withN,N′-dicyclohexycarbodiimide and directed mutagenesis experiments have identified a glutamate residue essential for proton transport (2Nelson N.

InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, two genes (VMA3 andVMA11) encode 16-kDa proteolipids, and both gene products are essential for a functional V-ATPase (18Nelson H. Nelson N.

Furthermore, a 23-kDa proteolipid encoded by VMA16 was also found to be required for function (12Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Up to now, multiple proteolipid isoforms have not been found in higher eukaryotes. From the contiguous sequence of Caenorhabditis eleganschromosome III, a putative proteolipid gene has been identified (21Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. Coulson A. Craxton M. Dear S. Du Z. Durbin R. Favello A. Fulton L. Gardner A. Green P. Hawkins T. Hillier L. Jier M. Johnston L. Jones M. Kershaw J. Kirsten J.

Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar), but the open reading frame of 302 amino acid residues is much longer than expected based on homologous proteins from other organisms. We have reassessed the C. elegans genomic sequence and surmised that the chromosome III locus actually contains two 16-kDa proteolipid genes. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of the two genes named vha-1 and vha-2, which are tandemly located as a polycistronic unit. The vha-1 and vha-2 gene products are homologous to those of other organisms. In addition, a third proteolipid gene, vha-4, was identified on chromosome II, and its 23-kDa proteolipid product shares a high degree of homology with the yeast VMA16 protein. The promoters of three vhagenes together with that of the V1 sector Bsubunit are predominantly active in an H-shaped excretory cell of the adult worm. Wild-type Bristol N2 was cultured and maintained as described (22Sulston J. Hodgkin J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988: 587-606Google Scholar). Animals were transformed using the selectable marker plasmid, pRF4 (23Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2446) Google Scholar). yk185d8, yk100 g12, and yk167f7 (lambda ZAP II cDNA clones of vha-1, vha-2, and vha-4, respectively) were kindly provided by Y. Kohara and were converted to recombinant plasmids using the Rapid Excision kit (Stratagene). The resulting plasmid pCVA-1 carried the cDNA fromvha-1, pCV10 carried the cDNA from vha-2, and pCVC-1 carried the cDNA from vha-4. Nucleotide sequences were determined using the Dye Terminator DNA sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). The nucleotide sequence data reported in this paper will appear in the DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBankTM nucleotide sequence data bases with the following accession numbers: vha-1,AB000917; vha-2, AB000918; and vha-4,AB000919. Total RNA from C. elegans were prepared from a liquid culture of mixed growth stages using TriZOL™ LS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After first-strand cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), PCR was performed with the following cycle conditions: 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 61 °C, and 2 min at 68 °C for 30 cycles with SL primers (SL1 or SL2 are equivalent to the C. elegans spliced leader sequences) plus gene-specific primers (vha-1, 5′-cttcactgatgatatcggcg-3′; vha-2, 5′-cggaaatccgttaagacttgg-3′; or vha-4, 5′-gatcccgttgtgaagattcc-3′). To construct the translational GFP fusion genes,vha-1::GFP,vha-2::GFP, andvha-4::GFP, genomic fragments that included the upstream region and sequences encoding the first two amino acids of each vha gene were subcloned in-frame into the GFP (S65C mutation) reporter vectors 2A. Fire, S. Xu, J. Ahnn, and G. Seydoux, personal communication. (24Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C.

The 6.2-kbBamHI fragment, which includes all of the vha-1and vha-2 genes, was taken from cosmid R10E11 and ligated into pBluescript II to make subclone pCV-F. To create thevha-1::GFP fusion plasmid pCV01, the 1.3-kb BamHI toSalI fragment of pCV-F was inserted into pPD95.67. To create thevha-2::GFP fusion plasmid pCV012, the 2.2-kb BamHI to Spl I fragment was ligated into pPD95.70. In the case of the vha-4::GFPfusion, the 5.2-kb BamHI to EagI fragment of cosmid T01H3, which includes a part of the vha-4 gene, was inserted into pPD95.67 to create pCVC01. To make the GFP fusion with the putative V-ATPase B subunit gene F20B6, the 3.2-kbHincII fragment, which includes the upstream and coding sequences for the first four amino acid residues, was taken from genomic clone F20B6 and ligated into pPD95.70. Total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). Probes were digested from cDNA clones (vha-1, bp +6 to +281;vha-2, bp +5 to +283; or vha-4, bp +21 to +359 (numbering from the first letter of the initiation codon)) and32P-labeled using the Random Primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Hybridizations were carried out using the QuikHyb solution (Stratagene). Analysis of the contiguous sequence of chromosome III led to the identification of a gene in genomic clone R10E11 that was believed to encode a V-ATPase proteolipid-like protein (21Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. Coulson A. Craxton M. Dear S. Du Z. Durbin R. Favello A. Fulton L. Gardner A. Green P. Hawkins T.

Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the open reading frame encoded a protein of 302 amino acids that is much longer than known V-ATPase proteolipids. For this reason, we reanalyzed the genomic sequence and found reasonable evidence that the chromosomal segment actually contains two genes very similar to each other (Table I). Both genes encode V-ATPase 16-kDa proteolipids with significant similarity to those known from other organisms. To verify this possibility, Northern blot analysis was carried out using probes that would differentiate between the putative genes. The two probes hybridized with distinct transcripts of different lengths (Fig.1). These results indicate that the genomic clone R10E11 carries two genes, both of which are transcribedin vivo. The two genes were named vha-1 (0.8-kb transcript) and vha-2 (0.9- and 1.0-kb transcripts).Table IPredicted proteolipid genes in C. elegans chromosomeGenomic clone R10E11 (21Wilson R. Ainscough R.

C. elegans genes are often transcribed in clusters, and polycistronic RNAs are processed to individual mRNAs by trans-splicing (26Spieth J. Brooke G. Kuersten S. Lea K. Blumenthal T. Cell. 1993; 73: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). One of two spliced leaders, SL1 or SL2, is attached to the 5′ end of almost all processed transcripts (27Zorio D.A.R. Cheng N.N. Blumenthal T. Spieth J. Nature. 1994; 372: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To assess whether the vha-1 and vha-2 genes are transcribed together, RT-PCR was carried out using primers specific for spliced leaders. The vha-1 mRNA was amplified by RT-PCR only with the SL1 primer (Fig. 2,lanes 1 and 2), whereas RT-PCR products ofvha-2 were obtained using either SL1 or SL2 primer (Fig. 2,lanes 3 and 4). Thus, the vha-1mRNA was trans-spliced to SL1 exclusively, whereas thevha-2 mRNA was spliced to a mixture of SL1 and SL2. The presence of the spliced leaders on both mRNA in addition to the structure of the gene cluster (Table I) suggests that the two genes are transcribed as a single polycistronic unit. The vha-1mRNA exclusively received SL1, implying that vha-1 is the upstream gene of this cluster because SL2 is known to be specific for trans-splicing to the downstream genes of a cluster (26Spieth J. Brooke G. Kuersten S. Lea K. Blumenthal T. Cell. 1993; 73: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar,27Zorio D.A.R. Cheng N.N. Blumenthal T. Spieth J.

The Expressed Sequence Tag data base of C. elegans provides preliminary sequencing data for terminal regions of randomly isolated cDNA clones. 3Y. Kohara, unpublished results. We searched for clones corresponding to vha-1 and vha-2 in the Expressed Sequence Tag data base and identified cDNA clones yk185d8 and yk100g12 as putative vha-1 and vha-2gene transcripts, respectively. Upon complete sequencing of the two clones, we found that neither clone contained a spliced leader, indicating that they lacked their 5′-terminal regions. To obtain clones of the 5′ regions, RT-PCR was carried out as described above. Sequencing of the resulting products confirmed that the 5′ regions of the initial cDNA clones for vha-1 lacked 31 bp, including the spliced leader, and vha-2 lacked 21 bp. The entire vha-1 cDNA was 830 bp (not including polyadenylation) with an open reading frame for a 169-amino acid polypeptide, whereas the vha-2 cDNA was 983 bp with an open reading frame for 161 residues. Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences revealed that vha-1 is an intron-less gene and vha-2 consists of three exons (Fig.3 A). Consistent with the known V-ATPase proteolipids, thevha-1 and vha-2 gene products are hydrophobic and possess four putative transmembrane domains. The proteins share 60% identity with each other and exhibited 55–67% similarity with 16-kDa proteolipids of yeast, mouse, and cow (Fig. 3 B). Especially noteworthy is the high degree of sequence conservation in the fourth transmembrane segment, which includes the putativeN,N′-dicyclohexycarbodiimide-reactive glutamic acid (Glu-153 in Vha1 and Glu-145 in Vha-2). This segment shares about 80% identity, and all remaining residues are conservatively substituted. The C. elegans genome project 4J. Burton, unpublished results.predicted that the T01H3 cosmid clone contains another potential proteolipid gene, T01H3.1, which is similar to the yeast VMA16 protein (12Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Based on the Expressed Sequence Tag data base of C. elegans, T01H3.1 was believed to be covered by five lambda cDNA clones. We sequenced both terminal regions of all cDNA inserts and selected the longest clone, yk167f7, for further study. The full sequence was determined, and the 1002-bp insert was found to contain an open reading frame for a 214-amino acid polypeptide with five putative transmembrane segments but without a spliced leader. This gene, named vha-4, contains three introns and maps to chromosome II. For analysis of the 5′ upstream region of the vha-4mRNA, RT-PCR was performed using primers specific for SL1 and SL2. Only SL1 spliced leader sequence was found associated withvha-4 mRNA, suggesting that the vha-4 gene is localized on the first gene of a polycistronic unit (Fig.4 A). SL1 was located four nucleotides upstream of the initiation methionine codon. As shown in Fig. 4 B, comparison of deduced amino acid sequences found that the Vha-4 protein exhibited 52% identity with the yeast VMA16 protein (12Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and 64% identity with a human homologue. 5H. Nishigori, S. Yamada, A. A., Fernald, M. M., Lebeau, T. Takeuchi, and J. Takeda, manuscript in preparation. A glutamic acid at position 100 in the middle of the third transmembrane segment is conserved in the three proteolipids. This residue was shown in the yeast V-ATPase to be critical for function (12Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To determine the sizes of the vha-1, vha-2, and vha-4mRNA, total RNA prepared from populations of mixed stages were hybridized with the 5′ region of each cDNA. Single mRNA bands of about 0.8 kb corresponding to vha-1 and 1.0 kb corresponding to vha-4 were found and were consistent with the size of their cDNA clones (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and3). On the other hand, two transcripts of 0.9 kb and 1.0 kb were detected by a vha-2-specific probe (Fig. 1, lane 2). The size of the longer RNA agreed well with that of thevha-2 cDNA isolated above. To assess whether thevha-2 gene contains the two polyadenylation sites, RT-PCR was carried out using a primer including an oligo(dT) sequence. Two amplified products with about a 100-bp difference were obtained. Sequence analysis showed that the polyadenylation of the shorter RT-PCR product was located 135 bp upstream of that of the longer one, which was identical to the isolated vha-2 cDNA clone. These results indicate that the vha-2 gene has two transcripts with different lengths. A cDNA clone corresponding exactly to the shorter sequence product was obtained, confirming that vha-2is transcribed as two different forms. The amounts of the vha-1 and vha-2 mRNA isolated were roughly the same and strengthened the notion that these two genes are transcribed as a single polycistronic unit. The amount ofvha-4 mRNA was 5–10-fold lower than those ofvha-1 and vha-2, which is a similar situation to yeast where the VMA16 protein is found in relatively low abundance (12Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The V-ATPase gene is expected to be a housekeeping gene because every cell has vacuole-related organelles. In addition, V-ATPase is strongly expressed in specific tissues (28Brown D. Sabolic I. Gluck S. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 231-243PubMed Google Scholar, 29Klein U. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 345-354PubMed Google Scholar, 30Davies S.A. Goodwin S.F. Kelly D.C. Wang Z. Sözen M.A. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30677-30684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To determine in which C. elegans cells the vha genes were most strongly expressed, three translational fusion genes,vha-1::GFP, vha-2::GFP, andvha-4::GFP, were constructed by inserting upstream sequences plus the first two codons of the vha genes into GFP vectors. Although the GFP fusion protein contains a nuclear localization signal, the protein is known to leak to the cytoplasm.2 All three GFP fusion genes were strongly expressed in the large mononuclear cell with bilateral excretory canals extending along the length of the body (Fig. 5,A–E). The cell body forming a bridge between the two lateral canals is positioned on the ventral epidermal ridge slightly posterior of the nerve ring. This cell is called the H-shaped excretory cell and is believed to function in toxin and metabolic waste excretion and osmoregulation (31Nelson F.K. Albert P.S. Riddle D.L. J. Ultrastruc. Res. 1983; 82: 156-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 32Nelson F.K. Riddle D.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1984; 231: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 33Hedgecock E.M. Culotti J.G.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1858-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition to the excretory cell, the three fusion proteins were detected in cells of the rectum (Fig. 5,B, C, and F) and a pair of cells with parallel orientation posterior to the anus (Fig. 5, C andG). No signals were detected without the control regions of the vha genes. In fact, the three fusion proteins were observed to have indistinguishable expression patterns. These results indicate that the vha promoters are strongly active in the H-shaped excretory cell, rectum, and a pair of cells posterior to the anus and imply that C. elegans V-ATPase may be important for the excretory function. To test whether the V1 sector was also highly expressed in the same cells as the proteolipids, GFP was translationally fused with the V1 sector B subunit gene. The GFP fusion of the B subunit was preferentially expressed in the H-shaped cell, indicating that the V-ATPase exists as a functional enzyme in the H-shaped excretory cell. We have identified three distinct C. elegans genes that putatively encode the V-ATPase proteolipid. All were transcriptionally active and were expressed in cells involved in excretion. Thevha-1 and vha-2 genes form a polycistronic unit on chromosome III. The proteins coded by the two genes share 60% identity to each other and are highly similar to the 16-kDa proteolipids of yeast (19Umemoto N. Yoshihisa T. Hirata R. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

Yoshihisa T. Hirata R. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18447-18453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

Since vha-1 and vha-2 gene products share equal similarities with the VMA3 and VMA11 proteins, we could not draw definite conclusions about the correspondence of the two yeast genes to the C. elegans counterparts. Despite their similarities, vha-1 and vha-2 could not restore the negative growth of the VMA3 or VMA11 null mutants, 6T. Oka, R. Yamamoto, and M. Futai, unpublished observation. which were conditionally lethal on neutral pH plates (35Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). A third proteolipid gene, vha-4, was found on chromosome II and codes for a 23-kDa proteolipid homologous to the yeast VMA16 protein, suggesting that the vha-4 is a functional counterpart ofVMA16. The discovery of the two genes, vha-1 and vha-2, for the 16-kDa proteolipid and vha-4 gene for the 23-kDa proteolipid is the first example in higher eukaryotes of three distinct V-ATPase proteolipid genes. In the lower eukaryote S. cerevisiae, all three proteolipids genes (VMA3,VMA11, and VMA16) are essential for function. An important question is whether the three C. elegans vha gene products are all required for V-ATPase function. In this regard, the GFP reporter gene experiments found that the three proteolipids have identical expression patterns, strongly suggesting that all three isoforms are necessary (Fig. 5). One is cautioned that each proteolipid may be used in the Vo sectors of different organelles. vha-1 and vha-4 gene transcripts had sizes expected based on their cDNA clones. In contrast, two transcripts were detected for the vha-2 genes with different lengths in the 3′-untranslated regions. In analogy to the two tissue-specific transcripts of the human V1 sector B subunit (37Puopolo K. Kumamoto C. Adachi I. Magner R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3696-3706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is tempting to hypothesize that transcription variants ofvha-2 may be expressed in different cells. The GFP gene under control of the vha-1, vha-2, or vha-4 regulatory sequences was expressed in the H-shaped excretory cell, rectum, and a pair of cells near the anus. We could not rule out the possibility that the expression patterns resulted from the overproduction of the GFP fusion proteins because transgenic animals were carrying the expression plasmid as an extrachromosomal array. This did not appear to affect the tissue-specific expression because the same expression patterns were observed for the GFP fusions under control of the upstream regions of three different vhagenes. It is reasonable to assume from these results that the signals of the GFP fusion proteins are closely related to the distribution ofC. elegans V-ATPase. Interestingly, the C. elegans P-glycoprotein, Pgp-3, was predominantly expressed in the H-shaped excretory cell (34Broeks A. Janssen H.W.R.M. Calafat J. Plasterk R.H.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1858-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the pgp-3deletion mutant was sensitive to both colchicine and chloroquine (34Broeks A. Janssen H.W.R.M. Calafat J. Plasterk R.H.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1858-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), suggesting that the P-glycoprotein functions in exporting toxic compounds. Because of the similar distribution of the vhagenes, we suggest that the proton electrochemical potential generated by V-ATPase may also be required for exporting toxic or metabolic wastes. The mechanisms and functions of V-ATPase have been investigated extensively and are well understood at the molecular level (3Anraku Y. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S.

C. elegans is a model organism suitable for such problems using genetic approaches. The present study is the initial step in elucidating the functional roles of V-ATPase and acidic organelles in development and behavior.

https://openalex.org/W1980212096,"Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the major regulator of proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes and their progenitors. These actions can be reproduced in the human megakaryoblastic cell line UT7 into which the murine TPO receptor, c-Mpl, was introduced. In these cells, TPO enhanced the expression of the specific megakaryocytic marker integrin glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa while decreasing the expression of erythroid genes (Porteu, F., Rouyez, M.-C., Cocault, L., Benit, L., Charon, M., Picard, F., Gisselbrecht, S., Souyri, M., and Dusanter-Fourt, I. (1996) Mol. Cell. Biol.16, 2473–2482). We have now analyzed the effect of TPO on the transcriptional activity of the GPIIb promoter in these cells. Using transient transfection assays of a series of human GPIIb promoter fragments, we delineated a TPO-responsive element within the previously reported enhancer region of the promoter. Although this enhancer included GATA- and Ets-binding sites (EBSs), we found that only EBS −514 was important for TPO response. We identified PU.1/Spi-1 as the endogenous Ets transcription factor that strongly and preferentially interacted with this enhancer EBS. This factor did not interact with other proximal EBSs in the GPIIb promoter. We next showed that TPO induced a strong and selective increase of PU.1/Spi-1 expression and DNA binding activity in UT7-Mpl cells. In contrast, TPO did not affect the expression of Ets-1/2 while weakly increasing the levels of Fli-1. Overexpression of PU.1/Spi-1 was further shown to enhance GPIIb promoter activity in the absence and presence of TPO. Overall, our data indicated that, in UT7-Mpl cells, TPO increased the transcriptional activity of a GPIIb gene in part due to an enhanced expression of an unexpected transcription factor, the Ets family PU.1/Spi-1 factor. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a role for the PU.1/Spi-1 factor in the regulation of megakaryocytic genes.

Megakaryocytic differentiation is characterized by the increase of DNA content in the cell, which involves an endomitotic process. This will lead to an increase in megakaryocyte ploidy and size and to the ultimate production of platelets from the fragmentation of megakaryocyte cytoplasm. Megakaryocytic differentiation is also characterized by the synthesis of a number of platelet proteins. Among these, the integrin αIIb·β3 complex (glycoprotein (GP) 1The abbreviations used are: GP, glycoprotein; hGPIIb, human glycoprotein IIb; bp, base pair(s); EBS, Ets-binding site; TPO, thrombopoietin; GM-CSF, granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor; EPO, erythropoietin; EMSAs, electrophoretic mobility shift assays.1The abbreviations used are: GP, glycoprotein; hGPIIb, human glycoprotein IIb; bp, base pair(s); EBS, Ets-binding site; TPO, thrombopoietin; GM-CSF, granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor; EPO, erythropoietin; EMSAs, electrophoretic mobility shift assays.IIb-IIIa); the glycoproteins GPIb, GPIX, and GPV; platelet factor 4; and the β-thromboglobulin are exclusively expressed on platelets and megakaryocytes. In the past few years, the 5′-regulatory regions of a number of megakaryocytic genes were cloned and sequenced (1Zutter M. Painter A. Staatz W. Tsung Y.

This TATA-less gene encodes a protein, the α-subunit of integrin αIIb·β3, which is expressed at a very early stage of megakaryocytic differentiation. We (10Uzan G. Prenant M. Prandini M.-H. Martin F.

Med. 1995; 181: 2141-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) previously showed that an ∼800-bp DNA fragment located upstream of the initiation start site of the GPIIb gene contains thecis-acting elements necessary for lineage-restricted expression of GPIIb in vitro and in vivo. Sequences crucial for tissue-specific expression of the GPIIb gene were identified using serial deletions of promoter constructs introduced into megakaryocytic cells. Studies showed that the two associated GATA/Ets-binding sites present in the human or rat GPIIb promoter are necessary for full promoter activity, with a dominant participation of the distal GATA/Ets motif (4Block K. Ravid K. Phung Q. Poncz M. Blood. 1994; 84: 3385-3393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lemarchandel V. Ghysdael J. Mignotte V. Rahuel S. Romeo P.-H. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21606-21612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This distal GATA/Ets motif is located in an enhancer region that is active in both erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lines (11Prandini M.-H. Uzan G. Martin F. Thevenon D. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10370-10374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A short enhancer-less GPIIb promoter fragment was also shown to be active in megakaryocytic cells in vitro only. This short 100-bp-long promoter was transactivated in non-megakaryoblastic HeLa cells when cotransfected with the GATA-1, Ets-1, or Fli-1 expression vector, suggesting the positive role of these factors in regulating the expression of the GPIIb gene in megakaryocytes (8Lemarchandel V. Ghysdael J. Mignotte V. Rahuel S. Romeo P.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 13Zhang L. Lemarchandel V. Romeo P.-H. Ben-David Y. Greer P. Bernshtein A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). However, although a number of Ets factors including Ets-1, Ets-2, Fli-1, and PU.1 were reported to be present in megakaryocytes, it is still unclear which Ets factors bind to the various GPIIb Ets-binding sites (EBSs) and which of these factors are essential for GPIIb promoter activation in vivo. Tissue-specific expression of the GPIIb gene was also shown to depend on as yet unidentified negative factors that bind to a repressor domain in the proximal part of the promoter. These factors specifically suppress the expression of the GPIIb gene in non-megakaryocytic cells (4Block K. Ravid K. Phung Q. Poncz M. Blood. 1994; 84: 3385-3393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Prandini M.-H. Martin F. Thevenon D. Uzan G. Blood. 1996; 88: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).While GPIIb gene expression is restricted to megakaryocytic cells, its expression is also regulated along with megakaryocytic differentiation. Only a limited number of studies analyzed the promoter elements that participate in this differentiation-dependent expression of the GPIIb gene. These studies always used erythromegakaryocytic cell lines induced to differentiate in the presence of phorbol esters. Interestingly, in these chemically induced differentiation models, regulatory elements that participated in the temporal expression of GPIIb were identified and located at the same positions as the tissue-specific positive and negative sequences (15Fong A.M. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18441-18447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the identity of the factors physiologically important in the regulated expression of GPIIb in vivo awaits further investigation.The cloning of thrombopoietin (TPO) and its receptor, c-Mpl, has provided a means toward understanding the molecular basis of megakaryocytic development. TPO was found to control the proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes and their progenitors specifically (16Bartley D.T. Bogenberger J. Hunt P. Li Y.S. Lu H.S. Martin F. Chang M.S.

Groopman J. Grabarek J. Blood. 1995; 86: 4054-4062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TPO receptor is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily and is believed to be activated through homodimerization (19Souyri M. Vigon I. Pencioelli J.-F. Heard J.-M. Tambourin P. Wendling F. Cell. 1990; 63: 1137-1147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 20Vigon I. Mornon J. Cocault L. Mitjavila M. Tambourin P. Gisselbrecht S. Souyri M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The human erythromegakaryoblastic cell line UT7 is dependent on the presence of the granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or erythropoietin (EPO) for its growth and survival (21Komatsu N. Nakaushi H. Miwa A. Ishohara T. Eguchi M. Moroi M. Okada M. Sato Y. Wada H. Yawata Y. Suda T. Miura Y. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 341-348PubMed Google Scholar). We had previously shown that, upon introduction of the TPO receptor, these cells acquired the ability to proliferate and differentiate along the megakaryocytic lineage in the presence of TPO (22Porteu F. Rouyez M.-C. Cocault L. Benit L. Charon M. Picard F. Gisselbrecht S. Souyri M. Dusanter-Fourt I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2473-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In these cells, TPO-dependent differentiation was associated with an increase in the levels of GPIIb proteins and mRNAs (22Porteu F. Rouyez M.-C. Cocault L. Benit L. Charon M. Picard F. Gisselbrecht S. Souyri M. Dusanter-Fourt I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2473-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyze the regulation of the human GPIIb promoter in UT7-Mpl cells in response to the natural megakaryocytic regulator TPO. Using transient transfection assays of a series of human GPIIb promoter-reporter constructs, we first delineate a TPO-inducible enhancer. We identify PU.1/Spi-1 as the major endogenous Ets factor bound to the TPO-responsive enhancer and provide evidence that TPO up-regulates the expression of active PU.1/Spi-1 proteins. This is the first identification of PU.1/Spi-1 as a transcription factor responsible for the regulated expression of GPIIb in a megakaryocytic cell line.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we provided evidence that, in the UT7-Mpl cell line, the transcription factor PU.1/Spi-1 regulates the expression of the megakaryocytic GPIIb gene through binding to a specific TPO-responsive element. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a direct involvement of the PU.1/Spi-1 transcription factor in the control of megakaryocytic gene expression. We further showed that TPO regulates the expression of active PU.1/Spi-1 protein in UT7-Mpl cells. This is the first evidence of the regulation of a specific Ets family transcription factor by a cytokine.The PU.1/Spi-1 factor is an Ets-related transcription factor that was first discovered as a target of insertional activation at the Spi site by the Friend virus (31Moreau-Gachelin F. Tavitian A. Tambourin P. Nature. 1988; 331: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). This insertion leads to an overexpression of normal PU.1/Spi-1 proteins in infected erythroid progenitors and consequently to immortalization of erythroblasts via as yet uncharacterized mechanisms (32Schuetze S. Stenberg P. Kabat D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Independently, PU.1/Spi-1 was identified as a macrophage and B lymphoid transcription factor (33Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) that regulated the expression of a number of genes in this two lineages (reviewed in Ref. 35Moreau-Gachelin F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 149-163PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of PU.1/Spi-1 was shown to be restricted to hematopoietic organs and was detected in myeloid, erythroid, and B (but not T) lymphoid cell lines. In bone marrow,in situ immunohistochemical analysis showed that PU.1/Spi-1 was present in early (but not late) erythroid and granulocytic precursors. In the same studies, PU.1/Spi-1 was shown to be surprisingly highly expressed in mature megakaryocytes (34Hromas R. Orazi A. Neiman R. Maki R. Van Beveran C. Moore J. Klemsz M. Blood. 1993; 82: 2998-3004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of other studies reported the expression of PU.1/Spi-1 in cultures of early erythroid progenitors (32Schuetze S. Stenberg P. Kabat D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Moreau-Gachelin F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 149-163PubMed Google Scholar, 36Galson D.L. Hensold J.O. Bishop T.R. Schalling M. D'Andrea A.D. Jones C. Auron P.E. Housmann D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2929-2941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggested a requirement for the PU.1/Spi-1 factor during very primitive erythroid development (37Voso M.T. Burn T.C. Wulf G. Lim B. Leone G. Tenen D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7932-7936Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Friend murine erythroleukemia cells, which were derived from Friend virus-infected erythroid progenitors and overexpressed PU.1/Spi-1, express quite high levels of a number of megakaryocytic markers in addition to the erythroid ones. Because of the expression of this megakaryocyte-like program, these cells were considered as a bipotential model of differentiation rather than being purely erythroid in nature (42Paoletti F. Vannucchi A.M. Mocali A. Caporale R. Burstein S. Blood. 1995; 86: 2624-2631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In light of our present data, it is now possible to suggest that overexpression of PU.1/Spi-1 in murine erythroleukemia cells is responsible for the observed expression of megakaryocytic markers. Therefore, although PU.1/Spi-1 was long believed to be a master switch in hematopoietic development in programming hematopoietic cell commitment and differentiation along the myeloid lineage, other observations also suggested a role for this transcription factor in early erythroid and late megakaryocytic development (32Schuetze S. Stenberg P. Kabat D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34Hromas R. Orazi A. Neiman R. Maki R. Van Beveran C. Moore J. Klemsz M.

Blood. 1995; 86: 2624-2631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Insertional inactivation of the PU.1 gene causes multiple hematopoietic abnormalities, with a lack of mature macrophages, neutrophils, and B and T cells leading to perinatal death of PU.1/Spi-1−/− mice (38Scott E.W. Simon M.C. Anastasi H. Singh H. Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 39McKercher S. Torbett B. Anderson K. Henkel G. Vestal D. Baribault H. Klemsz M. Feeney A. Wu G. Paige C. Maki R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5647-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Overall development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages seemed not to be strongly affected in PU.1/Spi-1 null neonates, with platelets being detected in peripheral blood smears and erythroid progenitors being present in bone marrow. However, the precise number and functional capacities of the erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors in PU.1/Spi-1 null mice have not yet been determined. Development of erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors during embryonic development of PU.1/Spi-1 null mice might be due to other Ets family protein(s) compensating for the absence of PU.1/Spi-1 and allows some megakaryocytic differentiation in these animals. In agreement with this hypothesis, we (Fig. 7) and others (8Lemarchandel V. Ghysdael J. Mignotte V. Rahuel S. Romeo P.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,13Zhang L. Lemarchandel V. Romeo P.-H. Ben-David Y. Greer P. Bernshtein A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar) found a strong induction of GPIIb expression in cells overexpressing Ets-1 or Fli-1, indicating a possible functional complementation/redundancy among various Ets members for the activation of megakaryocytic genes.Analyses of the mechanisms involved in megakaryocytic differentiation and the expression of megakaryocytic genes were performed with phorbol ester-induced differentiation models. In cells such as DAMI, Meg01, HEL, and K562, phorbol esters were shown to induce a strong expression of GPIIb along with the expression of Ets-1 and Fli-1 (but not Ets-2 and PU.1/Spi-1) mRNAs (8Lemarchandel V. Ghysdael J. Mignotte V. Rahuel S. Romeo P.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 43Athanasiou M. Clausen P. Mavrothalassitis G. Zhang X.-K. Watson D. Blair D. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1525-1534PubMed Google Scholar). Neither of these studies had evaluated the expression of Ets proteins in addition to Ets transcripts. We did not find any Ets-1 proteins expressed in TPO-treated or -untreated UT7-Mpl cells, indicating that endogenous Ets-1 proteins should not play any role in the basal and TPO-dependent expression of GPIIb in our cells. Furthermore, although phorbol esters induced a strong expression of megakaryocytic markers in UT7-Mpl cells (22Porteu F. Rouyez M.-C. Cocault L. Benit L. Charon M. Picard F. Gisselbrecht S. Souyri M. Dusanter-Fourt I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2473-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), these agents did not induce the expression of PU.1/Spi-1 proteins after 2–4 days of treatment (data not shown). Thus, the mechanisms involved in the TPO-dependent induction of megakaryocytic differentiation are at least partially unrelated to those triggered by phorbol esters. It is worth noting that, although we delineated a TPO-responsive enhancer in the GPIIb promoter, TPO still induced up to an 8-fold activation of the enhancer-less GPIIb promoter construct (see Fig. 2). This indicates the existence of PU.1/Spi-1-independent signal(s) able to activate the GPIIb proximal promoter upon TPO treatment. The identities of these signals are unknown. Whether these signals involve phorbol ester-responsive pathway(s) is currently under investigation.The mechanism(s) by which PU.1/Spi-1 might regulate the transcriptional activity of the GPIIb promoter is still unknown. However, the GPIIb gene is a TATA-less gene, and such genes have often been shown to depend on Sp1 and Ets factors to tether the transcriptional initiation complex at the transcriptional start site. Recent studies with primary rat megakaryocytes suggested that factors bound to the proximal EBS and Sp1 sites of the rat GPIIb promoter could interact with as yet uncharacterized enhancer factor(s) to form a transcription complex with the TFIID factor, joining the basal transcriptional machinery to upstream enhancer elements (40Block K. Shou Y. Poncz M. Blood. 1996; 88: 2071-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PU.1/Spi-1 has been previously reported to directly interact via its N-terminal transactivation domain with TFIID in vitro (41Hagemeier C. Bannister A. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). According to these observations and our present data, PU.1/Spi-1 bound to EBS −514 may provide a physical link between the basal transcription complex (TFIID) at the transcriptional start site and the enhancer region, which will regulate the magnitude of GPIIb transcription. Since a number of other known megakaryocytic genes (PF4, GPV, etc.) possess multiple Ets-binding sites in their regulatory region (3Ravid K. Doi T. Beeler D. Kuter D. Rosenberg R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6116-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 44Lanza F. Morales M. de La Salle C. Cazenave J.-P. Clemetson K.J. Shimomura T. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20801-20807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it remains to be established whether the PU.1/Spi-1 factor will also participate in the regulation of other megakaryocytic gene expression. Megakaryocytic differentiation is characterized by the increase of DNA content in the cell, which involves an endomitotic process. This will lead to an increase in megakaryocyte ploidy and size and to the ultimate production of platelets from the fragmentation of megakaryocyte cytoplasm. Megakaryocytic differentiation is also characterized by the synthesis of a number of platelet proteins. Among these, the integrin αIIb·β3 complex (glycoprotein (GP) 1The abbreviations used are: GP, glycoprotein; hGPIIb, human glycoprotein IIb; bp, base pair(s); EBS, Ets-binding site; TPO, thrombopoietin; GM-CSF, granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor; EPO, erythropoietin; EMSAs, electrophoretic mobility shift assays.1The abbreviations used are: GP, glycoprotein; hGPIIb, human glycoprotein IIb; bp, base pair(s); EBS, Ets-binding site; TPO, thrombopoietin; GM-CSF, granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor; EPO, erythropoietin; EMSAs, electrophoretic mobility shift assays.IIb-IIIa); the glycoproteins GPIb, GPIX, and GPV; platelet factor 4; and the β-thromboglobulin are exclusively expressed on platelets and megakaryocytes. In the past few years, the 5′-regulatory regions of a number of megakaryocytic genes were cloned and sequenced (1Zutter M. Painter A. Staatz W. Tsung Y.

This TATA-less gene encodes a protein, the α-subunit of integrin αIIb·β3, which is expressed at a very early stage of megakaryocytic differentiation. We (10Uzan G. Prenant M. Prandini M.-H. Martin F.

Sequences crucial for tissue-specific expression of the GPIIb gene were identified using serial deletions of promoter constructs introduced into megakaryocytic cells. Studies showed that the two associated GATA/Ets-binding sites present in the human or rat GPIIb promoter are necessary for full promoter activity, with a dominant participation of the distal GATA/Ets motif (4Block K. Ravid K. Phung Q. Poncz M. Blood. 1994; 84: 3385-3393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lemarchandel V. Ghysdael J. Mignotte V. Rahuel S. Romeo P.-H. Mol. Cell.

This distal GATA/Ets motif is located in an enhancer region that is active in both erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lines (11Prandini M.-H. Uzan G. Martin F. Thevenon D. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10370-10374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A short enhancer-less GPIIb promoter fragment was also shown to be active in megakaryocytic cells in vitro only. This short 100-bp-long promoter was transactivated in non-megakaryoblastic HeLa cells when cotransfected with the GATA-1, Ets-1, or Fli-1 expression vector, suggesting the positive role of these factors in regulating the expression of the GPIIb gene in megakaryocytes (8Lemarchandel V.

https://openalex.org/W2143967204,"In an attempt to unravel the role of conserved histidine residues in the structure-function of sheep liver cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), three site-specific mutants (H134N, H147N, and H150N) were constructed and expressed. H134N and H147N SHMTs had K m values for l-serine,l-allo-threonine and β-phenylserine similar to that of wild type enzyme, although the k catvalues were markedly decreased. H134N SHMT was obtained in a dimeric form with only 6% of bound pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) compared with the wild type enzyme. Increasing concentrations of PLP (up to 500 μm) enhanced the enzyme activity without changing its oligomeric structure, indicating that His-134 may be involved in dimer-dimer interactions. H147N SHMT was obtained in a tetrameric form but with very little PLP (3%) bound to it, suggesting that this residue was probably involved in cofactor binding. Unlike the wild type enzyme, the cofactor could be easily removed by dialysis from H147N SHMT, and the apoenzyme thus formed was present predominantly in the dimeric form, indicating that PLP binding is at the dimer-dimer interface. H150N SHMT was obtained in a tetrameric form with bound PLP. However, the mutant had very little enzyme activity (<2%). Thek cat/K m values forl-serine, l-allo-threonine and β-phenylserine were 80-, 56-, and 33-fold less compared with wild type enzyme. Unlike the wild type enzyme, it failed to form the characteristic quinonoid intermediate and was unable to carry out the exchange of 2-S proton from glycine in the presence of H4-folate. However, it could form an external aldimine with serine and glycine. The wild type and the mutant enzyme had similarK d values for serine and glycine. These results suggest that His-150 may be the base that abstracts the α-proton of the substrate, leading to formation of the quinonoid intermediate in the reaction catalyzed by SHMT.

Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) 1The abbreviations used are: SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; rSHMT, sheep liver cytosolic recombinant SHMT; H4-folate, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; PMP, pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate. catalyzes the reversible conversion of serine and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (H4-folate) to glycine and 5,10-methylene-H4-folate (5,10-CH2-H4-folate) and plays a major role in one-carbon metabolism (1Blakely R.L. Biochem. J. 1955; 61: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This enzyme is a component of thymidylate cycle, along with thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase and has been suggested as an alternate target for cancer chemotherapy (2Appaji Rao N.

SHMT contains covalently bound pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), which forms an internal aldimine with the ε-amino group of Lys-256 in the rabbit and sheep liver cytosolic SHMT (5Martini F. Angelaccio S. Pascarella S. Barra D. Bossa F. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5499-5509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Usha, R. (1992) The Primary Structure and Active Site Residues of Sheep Liver Serine Hydroxymethyl Transferase. Ph. D. thesis, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, IndiaGoogle Scholar). An early step in the catalysis is the formation of an external aldimine, i.e.cofactor-substrate complex, which absorbs between 420–430 nm. This is followed by the formation of a resonance-stabilized carbanion (quinonoid intermediate) with an absorption maximum near 500 nm (7Schirch L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 83-112PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of the quinonoid intermediate requires the abstraction of an α-proton from the amino acid substrate. It has been suggested in several PLP enzymes that lysine, which forms an internal aldimine, is the likely candidate for the abstraction of this proton (8Smith D.L. Almo S.C. Toney M.D. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8161-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Toney M.D. Kirsch J.F. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 109-119Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10Bhatia M.B. Futaki S. Ueno H.

In contrast to these observations, it has been suggested that inEscherichia coli SHMT, Lys-229 (equivalent to Lys-256 of rabbit and sheep liver cytosolic SHMTs) is not the base that removes the α-proton (13Schirch D. Fratte S.D. Iurescia S. Angelaccio S. Contestabile R. Bossa F. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23132-23138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SHMT has been classified by sequence alignments in the same family as aminotransferases for which crystal data are available (14Pascarella S. Schirch V. Bossa F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J.

However, the mechanism of reaction catalyzed by SHMT is different from that of aspartate aminotransferase, since it involves a Cα–Cβ bond cleavage and removal of proton from β-hydroxyl group of serine in the aldol cleavage reaction. In the reverse reaction, with glycine and 5,10-CH2-H4-folate, the 2-S proton (Cα-H) is abstracted to form the quinonoid intermediate. Chemical modification studies with sheep liver cytosolic SHMT suggested that Lys, Arg, His, and Cys residues are essential for catalysis (17Manohar R. Appaji Rao N. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The alignment of SHMT sequences from several sources indicated that a few of the His residues are conserved among prokaryotic and eukaryotic SHMTs (18Usha R. Savithri H.S. Appaji Rao N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As a first step in identifying the His residue(s) essential for enzyme activity, His-147, His-150, which were conserved among all SHMTs, and His-134, which was present only in eukaryotic SHMTs (TableI), were chosen for this study. An inspection of the alignment of the fold type I PLP-dependent enzymes showed that His-147 of sheep liver SHMT corresponds to conserved Trp-140 of aspartate aminotransferase, shown to be involved in PLP binding (19Hayashi H. Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In other members of the fold type I group, this position is occupied by Phe, Tyr, or His (16Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). However, SHMT His-150 is not conserved in other fold type I enzymes except aspartate aminotransferase and glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase. 2Grishin, N. V., Phillips, M. A., and Goldsmith, E. J. (1995) Protein Sci. 4 (Internet address: gopher://gopher.prosci.uci.edu: 70/00/PSvolumes/v4n7/SUPLEMNT/Grishin.SUP/Grishin.seq). This paper describes the construction, expression, and characterization of H134N, H147N, and H150N mutants. A study of the oligomeric structure and the spectral and catalytic properties of these three mutants suggests that His-134 has a role in subunit interactions, His-147 in the cofactor binding, and His-150 in the proton abstraction step of catalysis.Table IA comparison of the amino acid sequences around His-134, -147, and -150 in sheep liver and other SHMTsSourceSequenceReference134 147 150SHEEP cytE P H A R…G G H L T H G18Usha R.

Initially, the clones were screened by ampicillin selection and later by DNA sequencing according to the mutagenesis kit protocol. pUC 19 and pALTER-1 plasmids containing the mutated SHMT cDNA were purified and digested using the KpnI andPmaCI restriction enzymes flanking all three histidine mutations. The 520-base pair KpnI-PmaCI mutated DNA fragments were gel-purified and swapped at the same sites of pETSH vector (23Jagath-Reddy J. Ganesan K. Savithri H.S. Datta A. Appaji Rao N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The clones obtained were screened by sequencing. The entire 520-base pair KpnI-PmaCI DNA fragments were sequenced using SequenaseTM version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit in all three mutants to rule out the presence of other nonspecific mutations. pETSH, H134N, H147N, and H150N mutant enzymes were purified as described by Jagath et al. by subjecting BL21 (DE3) pLys extracts to ammonium sulfate fractionation, CM-Sephadex, Sephacryl S-200 column chromatography (27Jagath J.R. Sharma B. Bhaskar B. Datta A. Appaji Rao N. Savithri H.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Sephacryl S-200 fractions containing SHMT were pooled and precipitated with 65% ammonium sulfate. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A (50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm EDTA) and dialyzed against 1 liter of the same buffer (with two changes) for 24 h. This enzyme preparation was used in these studies. One ml of purified rSHMT (10A 280/ml) enzyme was passed through a Centricon filter by rinsing with 10 ml of double distilled water. After Centricon filtration, the absorbance was measured at 280 nm, and then the sample was lyophilized and weighed. The concentration at 1A 280 was found to be 1.2 mg with a molar extinction coefficient of 176,333 m−1cm−1. A similar value was obtained when the protein concentration was estimated by the method of Gill and von Hippel (28Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). This value was used for the estimation of all three mutant enzymes, since the absorbance at 280 nm did not change compared with wild type enzyme. The SHMT-catalyzed aldol cleavage of serine with H4-folate to form glycine and 5,10-CH2-H4 folate was monitored usingl-[3-14C]serine and H4-folate as substrates in the absence and presence of 500 μm PLP (29Taylor R.T. Weissbach H. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 13: 80-84Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar,30Manohar R. Ramesh K.S. Appaji Rao N. J. Biosci. 1982; 4: 31-50Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The SHMT-catalyzed aldol cleavage ofl-allo-threonine to glycine and acetaldehyde was monitored at 340 nm by the NADH-dependent reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol and NAD+ in the presence of an excess amount of alcohol dehydrogenase as described earlier (31Malkin L.I. Greenberg D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 85: 117-131PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. One ml of buffer A contained SHMT (1–70 μg), alcohol dehydrogenase (100 μg), NADH (250 μm), and 0–10 mml-allo-threonine. The reference cuvette contained all the above components exceptl-allo-threonine. The reaction was monitored in the absence and presence of PLP (500 μm) at 37 °C for 10 min. The NADH consumed in the reaction was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 6220 m−1cm−1 (32Ciotti M.M. Kaplan N.O. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 890-899Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The rate of cleavage of β-phenylserine to benzaldehyde was monitored at 279 nm for 5 min at 37 °C as described earlier (33Ulevitch R.J. Kallen R.G. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5342-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The amount of the enzyme (rSHMT and mutant enzymes) used in the reaction was in the range of 2.5–300 μg. The concentration of benzaldehyde formed in the reaction was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 1400 m−1cm−1. The rates of transamination of d-alanine to pyruvate and pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP) were determined by measuring the rate of increase in absorbance at 325 nm (34Schirch L. Jenkins W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3797-3800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in buffer A at 37 °C for 5 min. The amount of PMP formed in the reaction was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 8300 m−1 cm−1(35Peterson E.A. Sober H.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 169-183Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The concentration of the enzyme (rSHMT and H150N SHMT) used in the reaction was in the range of 0.35–1.5 mg. CD measurements were made in Jasco-J-500 A automated recording spectropolarimeter. All CD spectra were recorded at 22 ± 2 °C in buffer A using the same buffer as blank. A protein concentration corresponding to 0.12 mg/ml was used for far-UV CD studies. Visible CD spectra were recorded in a Jasco-J-20 C automated recording spectropolarimeter at a protein concentration of 1.2 mg/ml in buffer A. To analyze the oligomeric structures of the His mutant enzymes, a Superose-12 HR 10/30 analytical gel filtration column attached to Pharmacia FPLC system was used. The column was calibrated with standard proteins such as apoferritin (440 kDa), sheep cytosolic SHMT (213 kDa), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). The buffer used for this study was buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl and 0.05% sodium azide. The dissociation constants of the enzyme-substrate complexes with rSHMT and H150N SHMT were determined by a slight modification of the earlier procedure (36Schirch L. Diller A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3961-3966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate-induced quenching of enzyme bound PLP fluorescence was monitored using a Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorimeter. The enzyme (1 mg/ml) sample was incubated with increasing concentrations ofl-serine (0.1–50 mm) or glycine (0.5–100 mm) at 25 ± 2 °C, and the fluorescence was monitored at 450–550 nm after excitation at 425 nm. TheK d values were obtained from double reciprocal plots of the change in fluorescence units at 495 nm as a function of the ligand concentration. It was ensured that inner filter quenching was minimal and did not interfere with the measurements. [2-3H]Glycine was purified on Dowex-50W-12 column packed in a 1-ml syringe as described (37Chen M.S. Schirch L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3631-3635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rSHMT or H150N enzyme (60 μg) in HEPES buffer pH 7.4 was incubated with 30 mm [2-3H]glycine (2.2 × 105 cpm) for 10 min at 37 °C. After the incubation, H4-folate (0–100 μm) was added, and the reaction continued for an additional 1 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the denatured protein was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was loaded onto a Dowex 50W-12 column that was previously equilibrated with 10 mm HCl. The column was washed with 5 ml of 10 mm HCl, the eluant was collected (0.5-ml fractions), and the radioactivity was measured. Apoenzyme of rSHMT was prepared as described earlier (13Schirch D. Fratte S.D. Iurescia S. Angelaccio S. Contestabile R. Bossa F. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23132-23138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. d-Alanine (200 mm) was added to the holoenzyme in 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA and 200 mmammonium sulfate and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The pyruvate and PMP formed during the reaction were removed by passing the sample through a 30-kDa centricon filter. The conserved His-134, -147, and -150 residues were mutated to Asn by site-directed mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression of the mutant constructs was as good, since the wild type clone (pETSH) and the expressed proteins were present predominantly (>90%) in the soluble fraction. The enzyme present in the soluble fraction was purified by a procedure identical to that used for the wild type enzyme, and yields of the enzymes were in the range of 40–50 mg/liter. The purified mutant proteins were homogeneous as indicated by a single band on native PAGE and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified rSHMT (wild type), H134N, H147N, and H150N SHMTs were assayed using 0.6, 15, 30, and 30 μg of the enzyme, respectively. The H150N SHMT had the lowest specific activity of 0.06 units/mg, while H134N and H147N SHMTs had 0.18 and 0.09 units/mg, respectively, compared with a value of 4.8 units/mg for rSHMT. The far-UV CD spectra of all the mutant enzymes were essentially similar to the wild type enzyme, suggesting that there were no alterations in the secondary structure upon mutation of the specified His to Asn residues. The presence of characteristic spectral intermediates in the catalytic process of SHMT has provided a convenient handle to examine the specific functions of identified amino acid residues in the structure and function of the enzyme. It can be seen from Fig.1 a that H150N has slightly reduced absorbance at 425 nm compared with rSHMT, while H134N and H147N SHMTs had much less absorbance when an equal concentration of protein (1.2 mg) was used for recording the spectrum. H134N and H147N SHMTs had very little CD in the visible region (350–500 nm), while H150N SHMT gave a visible CD spectrum characteristic of the presence of an internal aldimine at the active site. H134N, H147N, and H150N SHMTs had approximately 6.3, 3, and 64% of the visible CD (at 425 nm) that rSHMT had, respectively (data not shown). It can be seen from Fig.1 b that the quinonoid intermediate (495 nm) was observed when glycine and H4-folate were added to H134N and H147N mutant enzymes. However, this intermediate was not seen with H150N SHMT. Even increasing the concentration of H150N SHMT from 1 to 5 mg did not result in the formation of this intermediate. The oligomeric status of the enzymes immediately after the Sephacryl-S-200 column chromatography step of purification was examined by using a calibrated Superose-12 HR 10/30 analytical gel filtration column. The rSHMT, H147N, and H150N SHMTs eluted as single symmetrical peak corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼220 kDa, indicating that they are in the tetrameric form. However, the H134N SHMT eluted as a single peak corresponding to the mass of the dimer (∼100 kDa) (Fig. 2 a). When the column was equilibrated with PLP (150 μm), the elution profiles were identical. Dialysis of the H147N mutant enzyme against the buffer not containing the PLP resulted in the formation of apoenzyme that was predominantly in the dimeric form; in contrast, the rSHMT remained as a tetramer with bound PLP under similar conditions (Fig. 2 b). Removal of PLP from rSHMT by transamination ofd-alanine followed by dialysis for 24 h resulted in the partial dissociation of the tetramer to a dimer (Fig.2 b). A unique feature of SHMT is its ability to catalyze a variety of H4-folate-dependent and -independent reactions (7Schirch L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 53: 83-112PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the role of the mutated His residues in reaction specificity, some of these reactions were examined. Table II summarizes the K m,k cat andk cat/K m values determined for H134N, H147N, and H150N SHMTs using l-serine andl-allo-threonine as substrates in the absence and presence of added PLP (0.5 mm). K mvalues of serine and H4-folate (1.0 ± 0.2 mm) for the mutant enzymes were similar to that of wild type enzyme, whereas the k cat values decreased significantly for all of the three mutant enzymes. A comparison of thek cat/K m values indicated that the H134N, H147N, and H150N SHMTs are 36-, 70-, and 80-fold less efficient compared with the wild type enzyme in the H4-folate-dependent physiological reaction in the absence of added PLP, whereas in the presence of 500 μm PLP, the activities were 6.85-, 8.64-, and 64-fold less efficient. The K m values forl-allo-threonine were similar in the absence and presence of added PLP for all of the mutant enzymes and rSHMT (TableII). However, the k cat values were markedly decreased. The k cat/K m values for l-allo-threonine with the H134N, H147N, and H150N SHMTs were 21-, 32-, and 60 ± 4-fold less compared with wild type enzyme in the absence and presence of added PLP. The difference in the k cat values of the mutants (H134N, H147N) in the H4-folate-dependent and -independent reactions in the presence of excess PLP could be due to the effect of a large excess PLP or errors in the estimation of the activity due to the interference of PLP absorbance at 340 nm, the wavelength at which alcohol dehydrogenase activity was estimated. The mutant enzymes catalyzed the β-phenylserine cl"

Considerable effort has been devoted to discovery of glutamate antagonists (1Scatton B. Life Sci. 1994; 55: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 2Lipton S.A. Rosenberg P.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar) in recent years, due to increasing evidence linking glutamate excitotoxicity to various neurological disorders (3Thomas R.J. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 1995; 43: 1279-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, while known antagonists can provide neuroprotection, excessive action of these classical blocking agents can obtain undesirable side effects (1Scatton B. Life Sci. 1994; 55: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 2Lipton S.A. Rosenberg P.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar). To minimize these undesirable side effects, modification of the redox modulatory sulfhydryl groups of the glutamate receptor has been suggested as a possibly superior therapeutic strategy (4Gozlan H. Ben-Ari Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 368-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Unlike classical antagonists, that can give complete inhibition by interaction at the glutamate receptor (e.g. CGS 19755) or directly at receptor-linked, calcium ion channels (e.g. phencyclidine or MK-801) (2Lipton S.A. Rosenberg P.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar), inhibition via the redox modulatory sites are expected to give only partial inhibition of function and thereby limit unwanted side effects associated with excessive antagonism (4Gozlan H. Ben-Ari Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 368-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). At present S-nitrosylation of glutamate receptors by an NO+ donor (e.g.nitroglycerin) is the only mechanism for partially blocking receptor response in vivo that would achieve this effect by interaction with the redox modulatory sites (5Lipton S.A. Choi Y.-B. Pan Z.-H. Lei S.Z. Chen H.S.V. Sucher N.J. Loscalzo J. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (2309) Google Scholar, 6Lipton S.A. Neurochem.

Baillie T.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We now report that DETC-MeSO also partially blocks glutamate binding to synaptic membrane preparations isolated from the brains of mice, and in addition, DETC-MeSO prevents seizures induced in mice by glutamate analogs or by exposure to hyperbaric oxygen. Male Swiss Webster mice (20–30 g) or male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) were used in the study. All experiments that employed animals were conducted in strict compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines on animal use and institutional regulations concerning animal experimentation. Animals were exposed to hyperbaric oxygen in a specially designed pressure chamber as described previously (11Faiman M.D. Mehl R.G. Oehme F.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1971; 20: 3059-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12Faiman M.D. Nolan R.J. Oehme F.W. Aerosp. Med. 1974; 45: 29-32PubMed Google Scholar). The time to first clonic-tonic seizure after bringing animals to a final pressure of 5 atmospheres of 100% oxygen or after intraperitoneal injection of convulsants was noted by criteria outlined previously (11Faiman M.D. Mehl R.G. Oehme F.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1971; 20: 3059-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12Faiman M.D. Nolan R.J. Oehme F.W. Aerosp. Med. 1974; 45: 29-32PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, the ability of DETC-MeSO to prevent seizures was tested by intraperitoneal injection of 5.2 mg/kg DETC-MeSO 1–2 h prior to bringing the animal to a final pressure of 5 atmospheres of 100% oxygen or intraperitoneal injection ofN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) (125 mg/kg) orl-methionine sulfoximine (MetSOX) (250 mg/kg). Evaluation of the statistics for whole animal experiments or for changes in brain glutamate binding after administration of DETC-MeSO was conducted by use of the program GraphPAD InStat from GraphPAD Software (San Diego, CA). Synaptic membranes (100 μg of protein) were isolated (13Lee Y.-H. Bhattacharyya A. Tang X.W. Seah E.-C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) from whole brain homogenate of male Swiss Webster mice and were incubated in 0.1 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and DETC-MeSO (1 μm to 1 mm) or 0.5 mml-glutamate for 30 min at 25 °C. After addition of 50 nm[3H]glutamate, incubation was continued for an additional 45 min. Reactions were terminated by centrifugation at 4 °C to separate membrane-bound from free radioactivity. Nonspecific binding (radioactivity bound in the presence of 0.5 mm unlabeled glutamate) averaged 20–30% of total radioactivity bound. The rate (k) and maximum percent blockage of glutamate binding (M) by DETC-MeSO (I) during the incubation time (t) was determined by fitting the equation: % inhibition =M(1 −e −kIt) to these data by use of the program Grafit (Erithicus Software Ltd.). This equation was derived for first-order inactivation by a group-specific reagent that gives a partial effect. If “A” is the percent of binding activity that remains after extensive exposure (t = ∞) of the receptor to excess DETC-MeSO, then M = 100 − A. The percent activity remaining at any time (a) would be equal to: a = (100 −A)e −kIt +A; substituting (100 − M) for Aand [100 − % inhibition] for a in this equation gives the one employed for purposes of data analyses. The maximum percent blockage of glutamate binding (M) observed did not depend on the concentration of glutamate employed in binding experiments, such that the modified receptors appeared to be “noncompetitively” inhibited (independent of whether DETC-MeSO was still present or absent at the time that glutamate binding was assayed). A second equation was employed in the analysis of binding data that defines partial, irreversible inactivation of two distinct groups of receptors: % inhibition = M 1(1 − e−k1It) +M 2(1 −e −k2It), whereM 1 and M 2 are the maximum amount of inhibition obtained for complete modification of each receptor population, and k 1 andk 2 are the rate constants for these modifications, respectively. DETC-MeSO was synthesized by the method of Hart and Faiman (14Hart B.W. Faiman M.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Carbamoylated glutathione,S-(N,N-diethylcarbamoyl)glutathione (DETC-GS), was prepared essentially as described by Jin et al. (10Jin L. Davis M.R. Hu P. Baillie T.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The structures and purity of DETC-MeSO and DETC-GS were confirmed by 300 MHz NMR and fast atom bombardment-tandem mass spectrometry. A QE300 NMR spectrometer (General Electric, Fremont, CA) and Autospec-Q tandem hybrid mass spectrometer (Fiscons/VG Analytical Limited, Manchester, United Kingdom) were employed for these analyses. Liver aldehyde dehydrogenase was extracted and assayed as described previously (14Hart B.W. Faiman M.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). MetSOX, monosodium l-glutamate, glycine, glutathione, and NMDA were purchased from Sigma.l[G-3H]Glutamate (46 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Life Science (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Treatment of synaptic membrane preparations (13Lee Y.-H. Bhattacharyya A. Tang X.W. Seah E.-C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) from the brains of mice with DETC-MeSO resulted in a time-dependent (k = 25 ± 10 m−1s−1), partial (M = 58 ± 7%), and irreversible loss of their ability to bind glutamate (Fig.1). Inhibition of glutamate binding appeared to depend on modification of more than one population of glutamate receptor, each with distinct kinetics. Although a better fit of these data could be obtained by use of a double exponential equation (see “Materials and Methods”), a unique fit of this equation to these data could not be obtained, due to the larger number of independent parameters involved. However, a nominal fit of these data indicated that about one-fourth of the total inhibition (M 1 = 15%) occurs at a much faster rate (k 1 = 900 m−1s−1), than the rate (k 2 = 8m−1 s−1) associated with inhibition of the remainder (M 2 = 43%) (Fig.1). Since the effect of DETC-MeSO on either receptor population is irreversible, glutamate receptor blockage in vivo can be easily determined. Synaptic membranes were prepared from the brains of mice injected with DETC-MeSO (5.2 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). The ability of synaptic membrane preparations isolated from DETC-MeSO-treated mice to bind glutamate was compared with similar preparations isolated from control animals. Fig. 2 Aillustrates the results obtained from synaptic membranes prepared from brains of mice killed 2 h after a single dose of DETC-MeSO or 2 h after the last injection of multiple consecutive doses (5.2 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, daily for 7 days). Either single or multiple dosing with DETC-MeSO reduced the capacity of synaptic membranes to bind glutamate by approximately 50%, the maximum effect obtainedin vitro (Fig. 2 A). For brain synaptic membrane preparations isolated from mice killed 24 h after a single dose of DETC-MeSO, less inhibition of glutamate binding was found (Fig.2 B). By contrast, for brain synaptic membrane preparations isolated from mice killed 24 h after the last dose of seven daily consecutive doses, similar inhibition of glutamate binding was observed to that seen 2-h postinjection of DETC-MeSO (Fig. 2 B). The results obtained for the group that received a single dose of DETC-MeSO and were sacrificed after 2 h were significantly different from the group that received a single dose and were sacrificed after 24 h (Bonferroni's p < 0.01 determined by analysis of variance). Comparison of the singly dosed group that was sacrificed after 2 h with the multiply dosed groups that were sacrificed after 2 h or 24 h did not show statistical significance from each other by the same criteria. It is hard to reconcile the ability of DETC-MeSO to carbamoylate brain glutamate receptors with its extreme lability in vivo. DETC-MeSO rapidly and selectively carbamoylates the sulfhydryl of glutathione (GSH) in vitro (10 m−1s−1 at 37 °C, pH 7), and since the concentration of GSHin vivo is high (1–6 mm) (15Potter D.W.

DETC-GS has been detected in the bile of mice treated with disulfiram (10Jin L. Davis M.R. Hu P. Baillie T.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Unlike DETC-MeSO, DETC-GS is not reactive and does not carbamoylate sulfhydryl groups (10Jin L. Davis M.R. Hu P. Baillie T.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although DETC-GS reversibly blocked glutamate binding to synaptic membrane preparations from mouse brain (data not shown), a time-dependent, irreversible blockage of the glutamate receptor, like that observed with DETC-MeSO, was not obtained. If the effect of DETC-MeSO on glutamate receptors in vivo is mediated by glutathione, then the carbamoylated glutathione requires activation. GSH, oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and DETC-GS reversibly blocked glutamate binding to mouse synaptic membrane preparations (data not shown). However, when the membranes were washed after exposure to GSH, GSSG, or DETC-GS, inhibition was reversed, unlike the effect by DETC-MeSO. Oxidation of the sulfur of DETC-GS to a sulfoxide would make it reactive toward sulfhydryl groups (9Madan A. Parkinson A. Faiman M.D. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 1153-1162PubMed Google Scholar), similar in chemistry to DETC-MeSO, and potentially capable of irreversible inhibition of glutamate receptors in vivo. Carbamoylated glutathione and DETC-MeSO had the same effect in vivo, despite the fact that they had different effects on glutamate receptors in vitro. Intravenous administration of an equimolar concentration of DETC-GS or DETC-MeSO (30 μmol/kg) to mice resulted in a comparable degree of irreversible brain glutamate receptor blockage (26.9 ± 4.3 and 38.2 ± 1.6%, respectively) or liver aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibition (30.1 ± 1.0 or 44.9 ± 1.0%, respectively). Since DETC-GS reversibly blocked glutamate binding to synaptic membranes in vitro(i.e. the inhibition can be reversed by washing the membranes to remove DETC-GS), but in vivo both DETC-MeSO and DETC-GS irreversibly blocked glutamate binding, and DETC-GS has no effect on aldehyde dehydrogenase in vitro (reversible or irreversible), it is suggested that DETC-GS is activated by oxidationin vivo (DETC-GSO, Fig. 3). To test whether carbamoylation of glutamate receptors might prevent seizures caused by glutamate agonists, the effect of DETC-MeSO on seizures induced by glutamate analogs was examined. Treatment of mice with DETC-MeSO prior to administration of the glutamate analog NMDA (125 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) prevented seizures that result from NMDA administration alone (Table I). Similarly, DETC-MeSO administered to mice or rats prior to injection of the glutamate analog MetSOX more than doubled the time that the animals remain free of seizures (Table I).Table IEffect of NMDA, MetSOX, and oxygen on mice and ratsTreatmentMean time to seizureControl animalsDETC-MeSO-treated1-bDETC-MeSO was administered at a dose of 5.2 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection 1–2 h prior to exposure to hyperbaric oxygen, NMDA, or MetSOX.minNMDA16 ± 3>1201-aThe mean values for the time to the first clonic-tonic seizure are reported ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab It has been shown that glutamate is released by rat hippocampal (brain) slices subjected to oxidative stress (16Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E. Cherici G. Alesiani M. Carla V. Moroni F. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the affect of DETC-MeSO on oxygen-induced seizures. Administration of DETC-MeSO (5.2 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) to mice two hours before exposure to 5 atmospheres of 100% oxygen, prevented the seizures that occurred after 24 min in control animals (Table I). NMDA is a selective agonist for a major subtype of ionotropic (calcium ion channel-linked) glutamate receptor (17Burnashev N. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1993; 3: 318-331Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As determined in the results illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, the effect of DETC-MeSO on glutamate binding to synaptic membrane preparations is not a measure of DETC-MeSO's modification of this receptor subtype. Although up to 34% of the total glutamate binding capacity of synaptic membranes is attributable to NMDA receptors (18Cincotta M. Summers R.J. Beart P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the effect of glutamate on these receptors is dependent on glycine (19Bonhaus D.W. Yeh G.C. Skaryak L. McNamara J.O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar), that was not included in the studies presented in Figs. 1 and 2. Under the conditions of these experiments, NMDA does not block glutamate binding to synaptic membrane preparations. When these binding experiments were repeated in the presence of glycine (0.1 mm), reversible blockage of glutamate binding to mouse brain synaptic membrane preparations by NMDA (0.5 mm, 32 ± 2% blockage) and irreversible blockage by DETC-MeSO (0.1 mm, 48 ± 3% blockage) was observed. The similar degree of inhibition observed by DETC-MeSO in the presence and absence of glycine (48 and 58% (Fig. 1), respectively) indicates that both NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptor subtypes are affected to a similar extent by carbamoylation. DETC-MeSO is effective in partially preventing glutamate binding to brain synaptic membrane preparations in vitro andin vivo. Inhibition of the glutamate receptor by DETC-MeSOin vivo is suggested to be mediated by GSH. DETC-MeSO carbamoylates GSH to form DETC-GS. DETC-GS crosses the blood-brain barrier and is then oxidized to DETC-GSO at the site of action. DETC-GSO would be the ultimate carbamoylating agent in vivo. The interconversion of DETC-MeSO, DETC-GS, and DETC-GSO is illustrated in Fig. 3. This novel and efficient method for delivering the carbamoyl moiety across the blood-brain barrier converts a small fraction of the circulating glutathione into a carbamoyl delivery system. Reaction of the oxidized, reactive (sulfoxide) form of carbamoylated glutathione (DETC-GSO) with another molecule of glutathione simply converts the carbamoyl moiety from a reactive form (DETC-GSO) to a latent one (DETC-GS). Oxidation of the latent form of carbamoylated glutathione (DETC-GS) would convert it once again to the reactive form (DETC-GSO). Thus, the carbamoyl moiety could cycle many times between latent and reactive forms prior to delivery at its site of action in vivo. Evidence that brain glutamate receptors are carbamoylated in vivo comes from: 1) the chemistry of carbamoyl sulfoxides, that are selective carbamoylating agents for sulfhydryl groups (9Madan A. Parkinson A. Faiman M.D. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 1153-1162PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jin L. Davis M.R. Hu P. Baillie T.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); 2) the effect in vivo is chemically (but not biologically) irreversible, as would be expected for carbamoylated sulfhydryl residues (9Madan A. Parkinson A. Faiman M.D. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 1153-1162PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jin L. Davis M.R. Hu P. Baillie T.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); 3) the rate at which the majority of glutamate binding is lost in vitro as a consequence of receptor exposure to DETC-MeSO (8–25 m−1s−1) is comparable with the rate at which DETC-MeSO reacts with the sulfhydryl of glutathione (10 m−1s−1); 4) the size of the maximum effect of DETC-MeSOin vitro (58% loss of glutamate binding capacity by synaptic membrane preparations, Fig. 1) is approximately equal to the maximum effect observed in vivo (53% loss of glutamate binding capacity after multiple serial doses of DETC-MeSO, Fig.2 A); 5) the partial effect of other sulfhydryl modifying reagents on the glutamate receptor (NMDA subtype) in vitro, indicating that DETC-MeSO modifies the known “redox modulatory site” of the receptor (4Gozlan H. Ben-Ari Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 368-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); 6) the protection by DETC-MeSO against seizures induced by NMDA, MetSOX, or oxygen at high pressure. While it is possible that DETC-MeSO elicits the effect at the glutamate receptor by a mechanism other than carbamoylation and/or prevents seizures by effects in vivo that are unrelated to modification of the glutamate receptor, these possibilities seem rather remote. NMDA is recognized to be a selective agonist of a specific subtype of glutamate receptor that is associated with calcium ion channels (17Burnashev N. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1993; 3: 318-331Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As such, seizures induced as a consequence of NMDA administration are commonly thought to be due to interaction of NMDA with glutamate receptors. By contrast, MetSOX is best known as an extremely potent inhibitor of brain glutamine synthetase (20Rao S.L.N. Meister A. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1123-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of glutamine synthetase persists long after MetSOX-induced seizures have subsided (21Lamar Jr., C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1968; 17: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), indicating that the cause of convulsions induced by this glutamate analog is not related to glutamine synthetase inhibition. It is not presently known which glutamate receptor subtypes may be affected by MetSOX or how potent these interactions may be. The discovery that glutamine synthetase inhibition does not correlate with the seizures induced by MetSOX (21Lamar Jr., C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1968; 17: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) predates by more than a decade the discovery of glutamate receptors and their essential role in the central nervous system (3Thomas R.J. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 1995; 43: 1279-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The observation that DETC-MeSO acts as a glutamate antagonist offers an explanation for several neurological effects of the drug disulfiram. First, it is consistent with the previous observation that disulfiram also prevents oxygen-induced seizures (11Faiman M.D. Mehl R.G. Oehme F.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1971; 20: 3059-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12Faiman M.D. Nolan R.J. Oehme F.W. Aerosp. Med. 1974; 45: 29-32PubMed Google Scholar) and requires bioactivation to DETC-MeSO (9Madan A. Parkinson A. Faiman M.D. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 1153-1162PubMed Google Scholar). Also, occasionally patients treated with disulfiram have been reported to exhibit various neurological disorders, such as encephalopathy (including schizophrenic-like symptoms), parkinsonism, ataxia, choreoathetosis, seizures, optic neuritis, and peripheral neuropathy (22Fisher C.M. Arch. Neurol. 1989; 46: 798-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Mokri B. Ohnishi A. Dyck P.J. Neurology. 1981; 31: 730-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hotson J.R. Langston J.W. Arch. Neurol. 1976; 33: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Patients with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia are thought to be especially prone to disorientation, impaired memory, and hallucinations upon treatment with disulfiram (24Hotson J.R. Langston J.W. Arch. Neurol. 1976; 33: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Some of these rare side effects associated with disulfiram are consistent with those expected due to excessive blockage of glutamate function in the central nervous system (1Scatton B. Life Sci. 1994; 55: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 2Lipton S.A. Rosenberg P.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar, 3Thomas R.J. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 1995; 43: 1279-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, in a controlled clinical study of the incidence of neurological side effects associated with disulfiram use (250 mg/day), there was no statistically higher incidence of neurological problems than were seen in a control population (25Branchey L. Davis W. Lee K.K. Fuller R.K. Am. J. Psychiatry. 1987; 144: 1310-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). If, in humans, the normal extent of glutamate antagonism by disulfiram were partial (e.g. 60% as observed for mice), then the effects of excessive blockage would only be manifest in individuals with unusual response (e.g.>60%) to carbamoylation of their glutamate receptors. As such, the average incidence of undesirable neurological problems would be quite low. In any case, since there is evidence that the density of glutamate receptors is increased as a consequence of chronic alcohol consumption (26Nevo I. Hamon M. Neurochem. Int. 1995; 26: 305-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 27Follesa P. Ticku M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13297-13299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the effect on the glutamate receptors by DETC-MeSO may actually be of positive benefit during treatment of the alcoholic with disulfiram. Furthermore, the physiology of the disulfiram-ethanol reaction cannot be completely explained by accumulation of acetaldehyde due to inactivation of aldehyde dehydrogenase (25Branchey L. Davis W. Lee K.K. Fuller R.K. Am. J. Psychiatry. 1987; 144: 1310-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is possible that part of the success of disulfiram in treating alcoholism has, in fact, relied upon its previously unrecognized effect on glutamate receptors. Much of the variability in disulfiram's effectiveness in the treatment of alcoholism can be attributed to variable extents of bioactivation to DETC-MeSO (9Madan A. Parkinson A. Faiman M.D. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 1153-1162PubMed Google Scholar). Not all of the adverse neurological effects of disulfiram can be attributed to modification of glutamate receptors. Disulfiram is metabolized to carbon disulfide, a known neurotoxin, and potently inhibits copper enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and dopamine β-hydroxylase, through the action of another disulfiram metabolite, diethyldithiocarbamate (28Haley T.J. Drug Metab. Rev. 1979; 9: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Eneanya D.I. Bianchine J.R. Duran D.O. Andresen B.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1981; 21: 575-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). DETC-MeSO does not share any of these latter effects with disulfiram (carbon disulfide formation or copper enzyme inhibition), 2S. N. Nagendra and M. D. Faiman, manuscript in preparation. so it would be expected to more selectively affect glutamate receptorsin vivo. In particular, DETC-MeSO is not likely to cause the seizures, optic neuritis, and peripheral neuropathy linked to higher doses (>500 mg/day) of disulfiram, that are most probably a consequence of CS2 formation (22Fisher C.M. Arch. Neurol. 1989; 46: 798-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Mokri B. Ohnishi A. Dyck P.J. Neurology. 1981; 31: 730-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hotson J.R. Langston J.W. Arch. Neurol. 1976; 33: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A strong correlation exists between glutamate excitotoxicity and damage due to free radicals (3Thomas R.J. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 1995; 43: 1279-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Brain hippocampal slices exposed to superoxide selectively release glutamate into the media, without releasing other intracellular constituents (16Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E. Cherici G. Alesiani M. Carla V. Moroni F. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which superoxide triggers the release of glutamate is not known. However, it is tempting to speculate that oxidation of sulfhydryl groups on presynaptic neurons, perhaps even sulfhydryl groups associated with presynaptic glutamate receptors (30Schoepp D.D. Neurochem. Int. 1994; 24: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), are responsible for triggering glutamate release. Carbamoylation of presynaptic sulfhydryls should render them less susceptible to oxidation by reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, carbamoylation of postsynaptic glutamate receptors (i.e. NMDA receptors) should ameliorate the consequences of reactive oxygen-induced glutamate release. Thus, DETC-MeSO may play a dual role in preventing O2-induced seizures, in that it could both prevent the triggering of glutamate release presynaptically and prevent the consequences of glutamate release postsynaptically. There is not a clear consensus on the origin of seizures induced by oxygen at high pressure. The ability of DETC-MeSO to prevent O2-induced seizures, while consistent with these seizures having their origin in glutamate excitotoxicity, does not necessarily resolve the complete etiology of these seizures. The molecular mechanism by which the glutamate system becomes perturbed and its overall role in the physiology of these seizures remains to be fully defined. Clearly, further investigation is required to elucidate the details of the mechanism(s) by which DETC-MeSO prevents hyperbaric oxygen-induced seizures.

Expression of the constitutively active, mutant form of Gα12 (Q229L), in contrast, stimulates loss of the embryonal phenotype. Expression of the constitutively active form of Gα13 (Q226L) stimulates differentiation of the cells from embryonal to endodermal, in the absence of retinoic acid.

Although it has been shown that disruption of the gene encoding Gα13 results in intrauterine death of transgenic mice (15Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.-P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), specific details of the roles of either Gα12or Gα13 in cellular differentiation or normal development in mammalian systems are lacking.P19 embryonal carcinoma cells provide an attractive model for study of early embryonic determination and differentiation (16McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M.V. Edwards M.K.S. Anderson P.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 17Jones-Villeneuve E.M.V. McBurney M.W. Rogers K.A. Kalnins V.I. J.

Under appropriate culture conditions, P19 cells display the ability to differentiate into derivatives of three germ layers, endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. Treatment of aggregated P19 cells with low concentrations (10 nm) of retinoic acid (RA) leads to differentiation of embryonal cells to endodermal and mesodermal derivatives (17Jones-Villeneuve E.M.V. McBurney M.W. Rogers K.A. Kalnins V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 18Bain G. Ray W.J. Yao M. Gottlieb D.I. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). At higher concentrations (100 nm) of RA, P19 cells can be stimulated to form neurons, glial and fibroblast-like cells (17Jones-Villeneuve E.M.V. McBurney M.W. Rogers K.A. Kalnins V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 18Bain G. Ray W.J. Yao M. Gottlieb D.I. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).In the current study we take advantage of the P19 cell system to explore the expression of Gα12 and Gα13during RA-stimulated differentiation. Addition of RA increases expression of both Gα12 and Gα13, prompting us to examine their role in cellular differentiation via blocking of expression with RNA antisense to Gα12/Gα13and via expression of GTPase-deficient, constitutively active mutant forms of either Gα12 or Gα13. Gα12 and Gα13 are shown to play essential roles in differentiation of P19 cells in response to RA. In the accompanying paper (19Jho E. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24468-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the linkage between Gα12/Gα13 and signaling via mitogen-activated protein kinases in differentiation of P19 cells is elucidated.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONP19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells are sensitive to aggregation and RA, differentiating to an endoderm phenotype in response to low concentrations of RA (10 nm) and to a neuroectodermal-like phenotype in response to high concentration of RA (100 nm). Aggregation on bacterial-grade Petri dishes for 4 days followed by dissociation and 3 days further growth on tissue culture plates is required for stimulation of the differentiated states by RA (18Bain G. Ray W.J. Yao M. Gottlieb D.I. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Untreated P19 cells grow densely packed, display a characteristic cuboidal morphology (panel A) evident in phase contrast microscopy, and are stained prominently by the embryonic marker SSEA-1 (panel B), as shown by indirect immunofluorescence signal (Fig. 1). Treatment with either 10 or 100 nm RA results in a dramatic change in morphology (comparepanels C, E, and G with panel A) as well as a loss of SSEA-1 antigen staining (panel D). These data demonstrate the loss of the SSEA-1 antigen in response to RA. Positive staining with TROMA-1, a monoclonal antibody directed against a class of cytokeratin-like proteins, is a hallmark of endodermal-like phenotype. Untreated, embryonal P19 cells fail to stain with TROMA-1 antibody (not shown), whereas P19 cells differentiated to endoderm by treatment with 10 nm RA display prominent staining with TROMA-1 (panel F). At higher concentrations of RA (100 nm), P19 cells differentiate to a neuroectodermal phenotype with neurite-like morphology as well as prominent staining by antibody 2H3 (panel H), an antibody directed against the 165-kDa neurofilament protein (22Tapscott S.J. Bennett G.S. Holtzer H. Nature. 1981; 292: 836-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The embryonal cells and those treated with 10 nm RA are negative for staining by the neuronal-specific marker, 2H3 antibody (not shown). Thus, P19 cells provide an invaluable model system in which to study how a morphogen like RA, in combination with aggregation, stimulates commitment of these cells to endodermal and neuroectodermal phenotypes.The expression of Gα12 and Gα13 mRNAs in P19 cells was investigated in cells allowed to aggregate for 4 days in either the absence or the presence of increasing concentrations of RA and then dissociated and grown further for 3 days on tissue culture plates (Fig. 2). Northern analysis detected transcripts for both mRNAs (∼4 kilobase pairs for Gα12 and ∼6 kilobase pairs for Gα13) in the wild-type, untreated P19 cells (Fig. 2 A), the Gα12 mRNA appearing more abundant than that of Gα13. Although mRNA levels of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were relatively constant in P19 cells challenged with RA from 10 to 500 nm concentrations, transcripts for both Gα12 and Gα13 were found to increase 2.5–2.9-fold over levels in untreated cells upon aggregation in the presence of high concentrations of RA for 4 days, followed by dissociation and re-growth on tissue culture plates. The increase in Gα12 and Gα13 mRNA levels prompted us to explore if similar challenge of another embryonal-derived cell line, the mouse F9 teratocarcinoma cells, would stimulate expression of either Gα12 or Gα13transcripts, or both (Fig. 2, panel B). Like the P19 cells, F9 teratocarcinoma cells displayed a 2.8-fold increase in Gα12 and 1.8-fold increase in Gα13 mRNA levels after 4 days of challenge with RA. At 6 days of exposure to RA, levels of Gα12 mRNA increase by 2.3-fold and those of Gα13 mRNA by 2.6-fold over that of untreated, F9 embryonal stem cells in culture. Expression of mRNA levels for GAPDH, in contrast, was relatively constant in response to RA. Under these conditions, RA stimulates F9 cells to differentiate from embryonal stages to primitive endoderm (28Strickland S. Smith K.K. Marotti K.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 347-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). These data suggest that commitment of embryonal cells to the differentiated state in response to RA is accompanied by a sharp rise in the expression of Gα12 and Gα13, at the level of mRNA.Figure 2Gα12 and Gα13subunit mRNAs are increased in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells and F9 teratocarcinoma cells in response to retinoic acid and present in mouse embryos at 6.5 and 7.5 days p.c. Panels A and B, Northern blot analysis of total RNA (10 mg/lane) from cells differentiated with various concentrations of RA were separated on formaldehyde containing agarose gels, transferred to Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and probed with radiolabeled cDNA probes for Gα12, Gα13, and GAPDH. P19 cells were grown on tissue culture plate (lane 1) or for 4 days on bacterial grade Petri dishes (lanes 2–5) and incubated on tissue culture plates for 3 days with 0 (lane 2), 10 (lane 3), 100 (lane 4), or 500 (lane 5) nm RA. These same blots were probed with GAPDH, demonstrating equal loading of RNA samples. Panel B, Northern blot analysis of RNA samples from F9 embryonal teratocarcinoma stem cells grown without RA (lane 1) or differentiated in the presence of 100 nm RA for 4 (lane 2) and 6 (lane 3) days. These same blots were probed with GAPDH, demonstrating equal loading of RNA samples. Panel C, RT-PCR amplification from total RNA prepared from mouse embryos at 6.5 and 7.5 days p.c. and maternal RNA. To preclude maternal contamination of the embryonic RNA, the ectoplacental cone was removed in 7.5-day p.c. embryos. Maternal RNA was isolated from the decidual tissue. RT-PCR was performed with primers specific for amplification of Gα12and Gα13 sequences using the RNA samples indicated as templates. Each of the experiments was replicated at least twice with similar quantitative results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next addressed if transcripts for Gα12 and for Gα13 could be detected in mouse embryos. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification with primers specific for Gα12 and for Gα13reveals the presence of both Gα12 and Gα13transcripts in mouse embryos harvested at days 6.5 and 7.5 post-coitus (Fig. 2, panel C). RT-PCR product was observed also in RNA extracts of the maternal tissue decidua. To avoid contamination of maternal RNA, we manually dissected the ectoplacental cone from the 7.5-day p.c. embryos. The stimulation of Gα12 and Gα13 gene expression in both P19 and F9 cells as well as the detection of Gα12 and Gα13 mRNAs in early stage of mouse embryo prompted us to investigate if Gα12 and Gα13 may play a role in cellular differentiation and/or mouse embryogenesis.Gα12 and Gα13 expression was explored first at the protein level by immunoblotting (Fig.3). Crude membranes from untreated P19 cells (where TC indicates cells grown on tissue culture plates alone) as well as from cells allowed to aggregate in the presence of 10, 100, and 500 nm RA for 4 days (aggregation + TC) and then dissociated and re-grown on tissue culture plates for 3 days were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose. The blots were stained with antibodies specific to either Gα12 or Gα13. In good agreement with the analysis of mRNA levels, expression of both Gα12 and Gα13 was observed in the untreated P19 cells. Challenging cells with RA increases expression of Gα12 to levels about 1.5-fold greater than the cells grown on tissue culture plates alone. For Gα13, expression was increased about 2-fold in the cells challenged with RA at either 10 nm (endodermal) or 100 nm(neuroectodermal). At 500 nm RA, levels of Gα13 expression rose to more than 2.5-fold. Thus, RA stimulates differentiation of the embryonal carcinoma cells to endoderm or to neuroectoderm and increases the expression of both Gα12 and Gα13. Expression of many G-protein subunits, except Gαs, remains relatively constant during adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 embryonal fibroblasts (3Wang H.Y. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similarly, in F9 teratocarcinoma cells differentiating to primitive or parietal endoderm, the levels of Gαs, Gαi1, Gαi3, Gαo, and Gβ1 all remain relatively constant. Gαi2 expression uniquely declines (4Watkins D.C. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whereas levels of Gα12 and Gα13 are shown to increase (present study) in the F9 model of early mouse development. Thus, generalized changes in G-protein subunit expression are not typical during differentiation in several well known models. Not only have changes in the expression of specific subunits of G-proteins been shown to be associated with cellular differentiation but have also been demonstrated to be critical features in regulating 3T3-L1 cell adipogenesis (3Wang H.Y. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and F9 teratocarcinoma cell differentiation (4Watkins D.C. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Figure 3Retinoic acid stimulates expression of Gα12 and Gα13 in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells: analysis by immunoblotting. Crude membranes were prepared from P19 cells grown on tissue culture plate alone (lane 1) or cells grown on bacterial grade Petri dishes for 4 days and then on tissue culture plates for 3 additional days (lanes 2–5), with 0 (lane 2), 10 (lane 3), 100 (lane 4), and 500 (lane 5) nm RA. The membranes (200 mg protein/lane) were separated SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with primary antibodies to either Gα12(upper) or to Gα13 (lower). Immunoblots stained for Gα12 were made visible by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoblots stained for Gα13 were made visible by use of the chemiluminescence regent (RENAISSANCETM, NEN Life Science Products). Data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments performed on separate occasions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To explore whether or not a linkage exists between the expression of either Gα12 or Gα13 and the capacity of the P19 cells to differentiate in response to RA, expression of the individual α-subunits was suppressed via constitutive expression of RNA antisense to either Gα12 or Gα13. The vector employed, a derivative of the pLNCX vector (4Watkins D.C. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), takes advantage of the cytomegalovirus promoter and has been shown to express antisense RNA and to suppress targeted protein expression in F9 teratocarcinoma cells (4Watkins D.C. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), as well as other cell types like hamster vas deferens smooth muscle DDT1 MF-2 and human epidermoid carcinoma cells (29Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although this approach has succeeded in suppressing Giα2 to near absence in several cells (4Watkins D.C. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we identified no P19 cell clones in which either Gα12 or Gα13 expression was abolished (Fig.4). After careful analysis of many clones, we observed that suppression of Gα12 by antisense RNA was no greater than 70%. Similarly, the level of suppression of Gα13 observed in viable clones never exceeded 80%. Clones expressing RNA antisense either to Gα12 or to Gα13 display prominent staining by antibodies to SSEA-1 (not shown), demonstrating an embryonal character even in the absence wild-type levels of either Gα12 or Gα13. Although possible that the vector may not operate well in the P19 cells, ample examples of vector expression in a variety of other cells, including F9 teratocarcinoma cells (4Watkins D.C. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1373-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), suggest that this not likely. Alternatively, one can speculate that perhaps the absence of either Gα12 or Gα13 cannot be tolerated and that the only viable clones are those expressing a threshold level of subunit sufficient to support cell proliferation.Figure 4Expression of RNA antisense to Gα12 and Gα13 stimulates a decline in subunit expression in stable transfected, P19 embryonal carcinoma cells: analysis by immunoblotting. Crude cell membranes were prepared from stable transfectant clones expressing antisense RNA specific for either Gα12 (lanes 2 and 3, panel A) or Gα13 (lanes 2–4, panel B) as well as clones harboring the empty pLNCX vector (lane 1, panels A and B). Crude membranes (50 mg protein/lane) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels, the separated proteins transferred to nitrocellulose blots, and the blots then probed with primary antibodies to either Gα12 or Gα13. Immunoblots stained for Gα12 were made visible by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoblots stained for Gα13 were made visible by use of the chemiluminescence reagent (RENAISSANCETM, NEN Life Science Products). Data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments performed on two or three separate clones for each antisense vector or empty vector alone and on separate occasions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Favoring the second possibility, one that could be tested directly, we examined the growth of clones in which either Gα12 or Gα13 was suppressed at least by 50–70% (Fig.5). Cells expressing RNA antisense to Gα12 and levels of Gα12 deficiency of ∼60–70% displayed a 2-fold decline in cell growth and an increase in the percentage of cells that detach from the substratum. For Gα12-deficient clones, cell number declined by two-thirds, whereas cell detachment was approximately 35%. Cells constitutively expressing RNA antisense to Gα13, in contrast, display only a slight reduction in cell growth but a prominent increase in cell detachment from the substratum. Approximately half of the cells detach from the culture dishes in the clones deficient in Gα13. Although trypan blue exclusion was evident in the bulk of the cells detached from the plates for clones deficient in either Gα12 or Gα13(not shown), the more direct question is whether or not these cells have initiated programmed cell death, apoptosis. To explore this possibility, clones were fixed with paraformaldehyde and then assayed for apoptosis using exogenous terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase with biotinylated 14-dCTP, counterstained with fluorescein-coupled avidin (Fig. 6). Although displaying some background staining, P19 cells transfected with vector alone did not show prominent staining using this version of the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling technique, reflecting few cells entered into apoptosis. Stable transfectants of P19 cells made deficient in either Gα12or Gα13, in contrast, showed marked staining of cells using the dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay, reflecting marked apoptotic activity. These data clearly link P19 cell deficiency in either Gα12 or Gα13 to initiation of programmed cell death and detachment.Figure 5Deficiency in expression of either Gα12 or Gα13 stimulates detachment of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. Tissue culture plates (100 mm) were seeded with cells (∼1.5 × 105 cells) from stable transfectants made deficient by antisense RNA in either Gα12 (ASGα12) or Gα13(ASGα13) as well as stable transfectant clones harboring empty vector (pLNCX). After 56 h incubation, media were collected, and the number of cells detached from the substratum as well as the number of those that remain attached were quantified. The data shown are the mean values ± S.E. for four separate experiments performed with two or more separate clones of each antisense vector and empty vector alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Deficiency in expression of either Gα12 or Gα13 stimulates apoptosis in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells.

After 2 days of growth, detached cells were re-attached to the coverslip by cytospin. The cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, incubated in the presence of exogenous terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and biotin-14-dCTP, and then counterstained with fluoresceinated avidin.

To test the linkage further, P19 cells were stably transfected with an expression vector harboring the cDNA for the constitutively active mutant form of each of the two α-subunits. Using the pcDNA3 vector, we created clones stably expressing the constitutively active mutant forms of Gα12(Q229L) and Gα13 (Q226L) and characterized their properties. RT-PCR and primers from a unique sequence in either Gα12 or Gα13 in concert with a primer just 5′ to the poly(A) region of the expression vector pCDNA3 revealed the presence of the mRNAs encoding the mutant versions of Gα12 and Gα13 could be detected readily in the stable transfectants but not in the transfectant clones harboring the empty vector (Fig. 7). Control studies of the RT-PCR employed primers for GAPDH, displaying equivalent amplification from the samples obtained from clones harboring empty vector as well as those harboring the cDNAs for either Gα12 (Q229L) or Gα13 (Q226L). Although not quantitative, RT-PCR amplification of RNA from clones transfected with the expression vector harboring the mutant forms of either α-subunit consistently displayed prominent signals (Fig. 7).Figure 7Expression of constitutively active Gα12 (Q229L) stimulates loss of embryonic phenotype, whereas expression of constitutively active Gα13 (Q226L) stimulates differentiation to endodermal phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W1988730832,"The protozoan flagellate Leishmania donovani has an active myo-inositol/proton symporter (MIT), which is driven by a proton gradient across the parasite membrane. We have used site-directed mutagenesis in combination with functional expression of transporter mutants in Xenopusoocytes and overexpression in Leishmania transfectants to investigate the significance of acidic transmembrane residues for proton relay and inositol transport. MIT has only three charged amino acids within predicted transmembrane domains. Two of these residues, Asp19 (TM1) and Glu121 (TM4), appeared to be critical for transport function of MIT, with a reduction of inositol transport to about 2% of wild-type activity when mutated to the uncharged amides D19N or E121Q and 20% (D19E) or 4% (E121D) of wild-type activity for the conservative mutations that retained the charge. Immunofluorescence microscopy of oocyte cryosections showed that MIT mutants were expressed on the oocyte surface at a similar level as MIT wild type, confirming that these mutations affect transport function and do not prevent trafficking of the transporter to the plasma membrane. The proton uncouplers carbonylcyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone and dinitrophenol inhibited inositol transport by 50–70% in the wild-type as well as in E121Q, despite its reduced transport activity. The mutant D19N, however, was stimulated about 4-fold by either protonophore and 2-fold by cyanide or increase of pH 7.5 to 8.5 but inhibited at pH 6.5. The conservative mutant D19E, in contrast, showed an inhibition profile similar to MIT wild type. We conclude that Asp19 and Glu121 are critical for myo-inositol transport, while the negatively charged carboxylate at Asp19 may be important for proton coupling of MIT. The protozoan flagellate Leishmania donovani has an active myo-inositol/proton symporter (MIT), which is driven by a proton gradient across the parasite membrane. We have used site-directed mutagenesis in combination with functional expression of transporter mutants in Xenopusoocytes and overexpression in Leishmania transfectants to investigate the significance of acidic transmembrane residues for proton relay and inositol transport. MIT has only three charged amino acids within predicted transmembrane domains. Two of these residues, Asp19 (TM1) and Glu121 (TM4), appeared to be critical for transport function of MIT, with a reduction of inositol transport to about 2% of wild-type activity when mutated to the uncharged amides D19N or E121Q and 20% (D19E) or 4% (E121D) of wild-type activity for the conservative mutations that retained the charge. Immunofluorescence microscopy of oocyte cryosections showed that MIT mutants were expressed on the oocyte surface at a similar level as MIT wild type, confirming that these mutations affect transport function and do not prevent trafficking of the transporter to the plasma membrane. The proton uncouplers carbonylcyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone and dinitrophenol inhibited inositol transport by 50–70% in the wild-type as well as in E121Q, despite its reduced transport activity. The mutant D19N, however, was stimulated about 4-fold by either protonophore and 2-fold by cyanide or increase of pH 7.5 to 8.5 but inhibited at pH 6.5. The conservative mutant D19E, in contrast, showed an inhibition profile similar to MIT wild type. We conclude that Asp19 and Glu121 are critical for myo-inositol transport, while the negatively charged carboxylate at Asp19 may be important for proton coupling of MIT. In kinetoplastid protozoa such as Leishmania myo-inositol plays an especially important role as the precursor for various inositol phospholipids found in the great majority of surface molecules in these parasites. These include glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored surface proteins such as the major surface glycoprotein, gp63 (1Chang C.S. Chang K.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 2Russell D.G. Wilhelm H. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 2613-2620PubMed Google Scholar), or abundant inositol-containing glycolipids such as lipophosphoglycan (3Turco S.J. Descoteaux A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 65-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and glycoinositolphospholipids (4McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Several of these surface molecules are involved in the invasion of macrophages in the mammalian host or the attachment of the parasite to the epithelium of the insect midgut. Strikingly, these glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored surface proteins and glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-related glycolipids are several orders of magnitude more abundant on the surface of these parasites than in the mammalian host (5Ferguson M.A.J. Brimacombe J.S. Cottaz S. Field R.A. Güther L.S. Homans S.W. McConville M.J. Mehlert A. Milne K.G. Ralton J.E. Roy Y.A. Schneider P. Zitzmann N.

Parasitol. 1992; 55: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we cloned a myo-inositol transporter (MIT) 1The abbreviations used are: MIT,myo-inositol transporter from Leishmania; TM, transmembrane domain; ITR, inositol transporter from S. cerevisiae; AraE, arabinose transporter from E. coli; GalP, galactose transporter from E. coli; XylE, xylose transporter from E. coli; GLUT1, mammalian glucose transporter 1; FCCP, carbonylcyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. from the parasitic protozoan Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of fatal visceral leishmaniasis and an increasing health problem as an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised individuals (7de Gorgolas M.

MIT shows significant amino acid similarity with two inositol transporters from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ITR1 and ITR2 (9Nikawa J. Tsukagoshi Y. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11184-11191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is a member of the 12-transmembrane domain sugar transporter superfamily (10Henderson P.J.F. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Functional expression of MIT in Xenopus laevis oocytes has revealed that it is an activemyo-inositol/proton symporter driven by a proton gradient across the cell membrane (12Drew M.E. Langford C.K. Klamo E.M. Russell D.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5508-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Subsequently, voltage clamp recording was used to characterize a 1:1 stoichiometry of transport with an ordered binding of a proton followed by a molecule ofmyo-inositol and subsequent transport of both molecules across the membrane (13Klamo E.M. Drew M.E. Landfear S.M. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14937-14943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Finally, immunolocalization studies revealed that this transporter is expressed on the plasma membrane, flagellar pocket, and flagellum of the parasite (12Drew M.E. Langford C.K. Klamo E.M. Russell D.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5508-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Many transport processes in these flagellates are thought to be proton-driven, and MIT thus presents an excellent model for the study of one such proton symporter in Leishmania. A plasma-membrane proton ATPase has been identified in L. donovani (14Zilberstein D. Dwyer D.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which can provide the transmembrane proton gradient for active secondary transporters. Knowledge of the function of protozoan transporters is still very limited, but from studies in prokaryotes, proton relay across cell membranes is thought to involve negatively charged amino acids within membrane-spanning domains (15Nagle J.F. Morowitz H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Two well studied examples are the lactose/H+ symporterlac permease of Escherichia coli (16Kaback R. Friedlander M. Mueckler M. Molecular Biology of Receptors and Transporters: Bacterial and Glucose Transporters. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1992: 97-125Google Scholar) and bacteriorhodopsin of halobacteria (17Lanyi J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 241-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Extensive mutagenesis oflac permease has revealed only four amino acids essential for transport, and all are thought to be charged transmembrane residues (18Wu J. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5213-5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, studies with the melibiose permease from E. coli (19Zani M.-L. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3216-3221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have defined a role for transmembrane aspartate residues in interaction with the counterions H+ or Na+. We chose the Leishmania myo-inositol/proton symporter MIT as a model system for active transporters in lower eukaryotes. Examination of the MIT sequence revealed that this protein has only three charged amino acids within predicted transmembrane domains: aspartate 19, glutamate 95, and glutamate 121 (Fig. 1). In this study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis, in combination with functional expression of MIT mutants in X. laevisoocytes and overexpression in L. donovani, to investigate the significance of these acidic transmembrane residues in MIT for inositol uptake. Promastigotes of the L. donovani DI-700 clone (Sudan strain 1S; Ref. 20Keithly J.S. J. Protozool. 1976; 23: 244-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were cultured at 27 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, adapted for Leishmania (DME-L medium; Ref. 21Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. Parasitology. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar), containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin (fraction V; Sigma) to replace fetal calf serum. Defolliculated stage V–VI X. laevis oocytes were microinjected with 8–10 ng (40 nl) of capped MIT cRNA, which was transcribed in vitro from linear MIT.pL2–5 template DNA by T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) as described previously (22Langford C.K. Little B.M. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17939-17943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Injected oocytes were incubated for 3–5 days at 16 °C and 80 rpm shaking in ND-96 buffer (22Langford C.K. Little B.M. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17939-17943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mm theophylline, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific in vitro mutagenesis (23Hutchison III, C.A. Swanstrom R. Loeb D.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 356-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was a modification of the procedure of Titus (24Titus D.E. Promega Protocols and Application Guide. Promega Corp., Madison, WI1991: 98-105Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA mutagenesis template was prepared from MIT.pL2–5 plasmid as described (25Viera J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.06 pmol of single-stranded DNA mutagenesis template was annealed with 1.7 pmol of phosphorylated mutagenic oligonucleotide (Table I) for 5 min at 75 °C, gradually cooled down to 45 °C within 30 min and to room temperature within 10 min. Mutant strand synthesis by primer extension and ligation was carried out for 90 min at 37 °C using 8 units of T4 DNA polymerase (Promega) and 3 units of T4 DNA ligase (Promega). One-tenth of this mutagenesis reaction (about 10 ng of template DNA) was transformed into the E. coliES1301 mut S strain to suppress in vivo mismatch repair (26Zell R. Fritz H.J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1809-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and amplified in liquid culture under ampicillin selection. Subsequently, 1 ng of mut S-derived plasmid DNA was transformed into E. coli XL-1 Blue cells and individual colonies were selected from agar plates. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed to generate the appropriate aspartate or glutamate mutation and to introduce simultaneously a silent restriction endonuclease site alteration (Table I). Mutant clones were identified by restriction enzyme mapping with a yield of 20–50% of mutants. The presence of the mutation was later verified by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method (27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52655) Google Scholar). For the mutations affecting inositol uptake (D19N, D19E, E121Q, E121D), the entire mutant gene was sequenced to confirm the introduction of the desired mutation and the absence of any other sequence alterations.Table IMutations introduced into MITMITMutagenic primerNucleotideNucleotide changeRestriction site alterationD19N5′-GAT:GAC GC*C CGT GTT:ATA GCC GAA GAG-3′730G → ADrdI site lostD19E5′-GAT:GAC GC*C CGT TTC:ATA GCC GAA GAG-3′732C → ADrdI site lostD32N5′-GAA GCC:GAA GT*G GTTC:TT CAT CTG GAA-3′769G → ANew XmnI siteE95Q5′-CAC GAG CAC CAC TT:G CAC*ATT TGG G:GC-3′958G → CBsiYI site lostE121Q5′-CGG CGA TGT TAC TT:G*CGC:CAG GTA CAC-3′1036G → CNew CfoI siteE121D5′-TGT TAC GTC CGC CAG GTA C:AC AG*G A:AT GGT GGC-3′1023, 1038A → T, A → CBsrI site lostItalics indicate nucleotides replaced in mutants.

Landfear S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 55: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the Xenopus expression vector pL2–5 (Ref. 28Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P.

Russell D.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5508-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) to produce the MIT.pL2–5 plasmid. For overexpression of the MIT gene in L. donovanipromastigotes, the MIT HindIII-HindIII insert of MIT.pL2–5 was subcloned into the Leishmania expression vector pX-H, derived from vector pX (Ref. 29LeBowitz J.H. McMahon-Pratt Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar; kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Beverley, Harvard Medical School) by introducing aHindIII site into the BamHI site of pX, to produce the MIT.pX-H plasmid. Transfection of the MIT.pX-H plasmid intoL. donovani promastigotes was performed by electroporation as described previously (30Piper R.C. Xu X. Russell D.G. Little B.M. Landfear S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and transfectants were selected in liquid medium containing 200 μg/ml neomycin analog G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). For transport assays inLeishmania and oocytes,myo-[2-3H]inositol (specific activity of 21 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) was utilized. Promastigotes from middle to late log phase L. donovani culture, transfected with MIT.pX-H, were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and resuspended in PBS. Transport was measured at 25 °C and initiated by adding 100 μl of cells (5 × 107) to 100 μl of radiolabeled myo-inositol at 50 μmfinal concentration in PBS. At various time points between 10 and 120 s, transport was stopped by spinning the cells through an oil cushion of 100 μl of dibutyl phthalate in a microcentrifuge tube, followed by immediate snap freezing of the tube in a dry ice/ethanol bath. The tip of the tube with the frozen cell pellet was then clipped off into 250 μl of 1% SDS, mixed with 2 ml of EcoLume (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), and analyzed by liquid scintilation counting. The initialmyo-inositol uptake rate was determined by linear regression analysis from the linear uptake range for the various transfectants. Transport measurements in Xenopus oocytes were performed at room temperature and initiated by adding three or four oocytes to 300 μl of radiolabeled myo-inositol (50 μm to 3 mm final concentration) in ND-96 buffer. After 30 min of incubation, the oocytes were washed three times in 2 ml each of ND-96 buffer. Subsequently, each oocyte was individually solubilized in 250 μl of 1% SDS and analyzed by liquid scintilation counting in EcoLume as described above. Water-injected oocytes served as control for MIT-specific inositol uptake determination. For inhibitor studies, protonophores or other potential inhibitors (applied from an ethanol stock solution) were preincubated with the oocytes for 10 min prior to the initiation of uptake assays, and cells incubated with 1% ethanol served as control. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by the paired sample t test, and all p values are two-tailed (31Zar J.H. Biostatistical Analysis. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1984: 150-153Google Scholar). For the substrate saturation kinetics,K m and V max values were determined by least squares fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation, employing the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (KaleidaGraph program, Synergy Software) (22Langford C.K. Little B.M. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17939-17943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody against the 136-amino acid hydrophilic COOH-terminal domain of MIT (MIT-COOH) was produced against an MIT-COOH glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (12Drew M.E. Langford C.K. Klamo E.M. Russell D.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5508-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For MIT immunolocalization in oocyte cryosections, MIT-expressing oocytes (four per wild-type or mutant) were fixed in 3% formaldehyde/PBS for 2 h at room temperature, infiltrated with 20% sucrose/PBS overnight at 4 °C, and embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek U.S.A., Torrance, CA) for at least 5 h at room temperature (32Lostao M.P. Hirayama B.A. Panayotova-Heiermann M. Sampogna S.L. Bok D. Wright E.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Embedded samples were rapidly frozen in dry ice, and semithin cryosections (8–10 μm) were cut on a cryostat, mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated slides, dried, and stored at −20 °C. Subsequently, MIT protein was immunolocalized in oocyte sections blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 10 min, followed by a 1-h incubation with MIT-COOH rabbit antiserum (diluted 1:100 in 1% BSA/PBS) and Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; diluted 1:500 in 1% BSA/PBS) for 30 min. Oocyte sections were examined with a Leica confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) with a Leitz × 63 oil immersion lens as described previously (30Piper R.C. Xu X. Russell D.G. Little B.M. Landfear S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All oocytes in Fig.4 came from the same batch, and for each mutant, oocytes from the same microinjection were tested for mutant-specific inositol uptake prior to the embedding procedure. As shown in Fig.2, alteration of either Asp19(TM1) or Glu121 (TM4) from the charged carboxylate to the uncharged amide reduced transport activity to about 2% of wild-type activity when the mutants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. For all measurements in oocytes, MIT-specific inositol uptake was determined by subtracting the values of water-injected control oocytes from the same batch for each experiment, and the resulting D19N-specific and E121Q-specific inositol uptake, although low, was significantly different from the background level of water-injected oocytes, with p < 0.01 and p < 0.02, respectively (paired sample t test). The mutant D32N in extracellular loop 1 served as control and did not affect inositol uptake significantly. One of the acidic transmembrane residues, Asp95 (TM3), also showed no effect when mutated (Fig. 2). Subsequent transfection and overexpression of MIT inLeishmania confirmed the significance of Asp19and Glu121 for MIT transport function. Transport was reduced by 96 and 97%, respectively, in flagellates overexpressing the two mutants compared with MIT wild-type overexpressors (Fig. 2). MIT overexpressors showed 21-fold higher inositol uptake compared with endogenous MIT transport activity of Leishmania transfected with the vector alone, and inositol transport in D19N- and E121Q-overexpressing parasites was also significantly different from endogenous MIT transport (p < 0.01 andp < 0.06, respectively). Finally, growth of transfected parasites under drug selection did not affect MIT activity, with 72.4 ± 13.7 pmol/min and 70.7 ± 5.6 pmol/min per 108 cells in pX-H-transfected flagellates and untransfectedLeishmania, respectively (Fig. 2). As a next step, we mutated the two residues affecting inositol uptake to the alternative carboxylate form and thus retained the charge. These conservative mutations both showed a significant reduction on inositol uptake compared with MIT wild type, but inositol uptake was 11-fold higher in D19E and 2-fold higher in E121D than in the respective nonconservative mutations to the uncharged amide (Fig. 2). Thus, amino acid side chain length appears to be more restricted for the negative charge at position 121 than for the apparently more flexible negative charge at position 19. Substrate saturation kinetics revealed that the transporter's substrate affinity was not significantly changed in the two mutants affecting inositol uptake, instead demonstrating a dramatic reduction of the V max values by 97% (D19N) and 98% (E121Q) compared with MIT wild-type activity (Fig.3 and TableII). Alternative monovalent cations such as Li+ or Rb+ at 1 mm concentration in the uptake buffer could not restore inositol transport activity in the two mutants with reduced inositol uptake (data not shown).Table IIKinetics of inositol uptake in MIT mutantsK mV maxV mut/V wtnμmpmol/30 min/oocyte%Wild type640 ± 144465 ± 1521004D19N509 ± 22916 ± 2.53.4 ± 0.54D32N554 ± 147556 ± 136120 ± 293E95Q699 ± 277556 ± 166120 ± 363E121Q437 ± 12110 ± 1.02.2 ± 0.23Substrate saturation kinetics of myo-inositol uptake were determined in Xenopus oocytes injected with 8–10 ng ofin vitro transcribed cRNA.

The means ± S.D. from three or four independent experiments (number on the right), each performed with three or four oocytes, are shown. V mut/V wt was obtained by dividing each V max value by theV max determined for the wild-type transporter. Immunofluorescence microscopy of oocyte cryosections showed that MIT mutants were expressed on the oocyte surface in similar quantity as MIT wild type (Fig. 4), confirming that these mutations affect transport function, inhibiting inositol uptake up to 98%, and do not prevent trafficking of the transporter to the plasma membrane. Water-injected oocytes served as control and did not show any plasma membrane staining (Fig. 4). MIT was expressed homogeneously over the entire oocyte plasma membrane of both animal and vegetal pole. The results shown in Fig. 4 were confirmed by examining four separate oocytes expressing each MIT mutant. Subsequently, we investigated the effect of two protonophores and uncouplers on the various mutants. The proton gradient uncouplers FCCP and dinitrophenol inhibited inositol transport by 50–70% in the wild-type as well as in the control mutant D32N. The same protonophore sensitivity was found in the MIT mutants E95Q and E121Q, despite the reduced transport activity of the latter one (Fig.5). Surprisingly, one mutant, D19N, completely lost all inhibition and instead was stimulated about 4-fold by either protonophore (statistical significance: p < 0.002, paired sample t test). Subsequently, we further investigated the pharmacology and pH dependence of this interesting Asp19 mutant (Table III). Phenol did not show the stimulatory effect on D19N and served as control for the protonophore effect of dinitrophenol, separating from its effects as an organic solvent. Monensin had no effect on inositol uptake in any of the Asp19 mutants or MIT wild type, and as a Na+ ionophore it served as control for the H+ specificity of the D19N effect (Table III, top). Finally, cyanide showed a similar effect as the protonophores and inhibited MIT wild type and the D19E mutant 44–50% but stimulated inositol uptake about 2-fold in the D19N mutant (p < 0.02). This latter reagent was used to indirectly reduce the proton gradient by affecting H+-ATPase activity, due to the inhibition of cytochrome activity and reduction of ATP levels in the cells.Table IIIPharmacology and pH dependence of inositol uptake in MIT wild type and D19 mutantsInositol uptakeWild-typeD19ND19E% (inhibitor/control)Inhibitor Control, 1% ethanol (6)100100 100 FCCP, 10 μm (6)45.7 ± 15.6391.1 ± 124.9***56.3 ± 9.9 DNP, 1.5 mm (3)34.3 ± 15.5399.9 ± 151.7*41.6 ± 17.8 Phenol, 1.5 mm (3)104.8 ± 15.688.2 ± 3.689.0 ± 18.6 Monensin, 2 μm (3)98.7 ± 6.8100.5 ± 9.2108.0 ± 5.2 NaCN, 1 mm (3)50.4 ± 15.3212.2 ± 34.9**56.0 ± 16.2% (pH/control)pH of uptake medium pH 6.5 (3)345.9 ± 52.689.6 ± 4.3**122.4 ± 18.1 pH 7.5, control (3)100100 100 pH 8.5 (3)41.2 ± 3.5174.5 ± 35.1**74.7 ± 20.8Xenopus oocytes were injected with in vitrotranscribed MIT cRNA and assayed for myo-inositol uptake in the presence of (top) various inhibitors or 1% ethanol as control, or (bottom) various pH values of the uptake medium.

Data were obtained at 50 μm inositol concentration from three or six independent experiments (number in parentheses) with three or four oocytes each (mean ± S.D.); 100% inositol uptake equal to 51.4, 0.93, or 10.5 pmol/30 min/oocyte for MIT wild type, D19N, or D19E mutant, respectively. Statistical significance compared with wild-type: *, p < 0.10; **, p < 0.02; ***,p < 0.002 (paired sample t test). A reversal of pH dependence of inositol uptake in the D19N mutant compared with MIT wild type and D19E (Table III, bottom) further supported the results obtained by the proton gradient uncouplers. Inositol uptake in the D19N mutant was stimulated about 1.7-fold when the extracellular proton concentration was reduced from pH 7.5 to pH 8.5, whereas MIT wild type was inhibited about 60% at pH 8.5. Conversely, an increased extracellular proton concentration at pH 6.5 stimulated inositol uptake in MIT wild type about 3.5-fold compared with pH 7.5, while D19N was inhibited about 10% (Table III, bottom). The cumulative data in Table III show that the conservative mutant D19E has the same inhibition profile as MIT wild type and, together with the other controls, suggest that the stimulatory effect of protonophores or reduced extracellular proton concentration upon D19N results from the removal of the charge of the carboxylate and a reduction of the cell's proton gradient. These results underscore the probable importance of aspartate 19 in proton symport, although we do not currently understand how this stimulation occurs. One possibility is that alteration of the transporter's protonation may lead to conformational changes in the D19N mutant and the observed stimulatory effect on inositol transport. Acidic amino acid residues have been shown to be important in translocation of protons across membranes in bacteriorhodopsin, where Asp85 and Asp96 have been postulated to play direct roles in transfer of protons from inside to outside of the membrane (17Lanyi J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 241-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In the lac permease, Asp325 and three positively charged residues, His322, Arg302, and Lys319, have been proposed as important residues for transport (16Kaback R. Friedlander M. Mueckler M. Molecular Biology of Receptors and Transporters: Bacterial and Glucose Transporters. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1992: 97-125Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the E. coli melibiose permease, the acidic transmembrane residues Asp31, Asp51, Asp55, and Asp120 have been implicated in interaction with both the H+ and Na+ cosubstrates (19Zani M.-L. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3216-3221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, alteration of these residues changes the counterion specificity of this transporter. The apparently central role of charged transmembrane residues in transporter function encouraged us to identify and alter, by mutagenesis, such residues in MIT. Indeed, we have found that alteration of two of the three charged transmembrane residues almost eliminates transport activity. Although we do not know the specific function of Asp19 or Glu121 in MIT, these amino acids are likely candidates to be directly involved in transport mechanism. Conversely, alteration of Glu95 to Gln does not affect transport function, indicating that alteration of any charged transmembrane residue is not sufficient to eliminate transport function. Subsequently, we compared the conservation of the three acidic transmembrane residues in MIT with five inositol and sugar/proton symporters from bacteria and yeast (Fig.6), all sharing an active transport mechanism. Amino acid sequence alignment of the corresponding transmembrane domains 1, 3, and 4 was analyzed and quantitated through the variability profile as the number of different amino acids occurring at each locus (33Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2473) Google Scholar). Asp19 and Glu121of MIT were 100% conserved in all six proton symporters, whereas Glu95 was not conserved, with three different amino acids found at that locus in the six transporters (Fig. 6). Conservation of amino acids is a sign of their potential significance with regard to protein function, and these findings match our mutagenesis studies and underscore the importance of Asp19 and Glu121for MIT function. While the MIT Asp19 position is an aspartate in these six proton symporters, it is an asparagine in the homologous facilitated diffusion transporter GLUT1. Glu121, however, remains a glutamate in GLUT1. The possible importance of Asp19 for proton binding is underscored by the pharmacology of MIT wild type and Asp19 mutants (Table III). Active proton-coupled inositol transport is found for a carboxylate side chain at residue 19 (Asp19 or Glu19), as suggested by inhibition with protonophores or cyanide. The mutant with the uncharged amide Asn19, in contrast, is not inhibited by proton uncouplers. Currently, we cannot fully explain the stimulatory effect of a reduced proton gradient upon the D19N mutant, other then a possible allosteric effect that may be caused by changes in the protonation of the transporter mutant. Alteration of transporter ionization was also suggested for the increased transport activity at acidic pH for a facilitated diffusion sugar transporter from lysosomes (34Mancini G.M.S. Beerens C.E.M.T. Verheijen F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12380-12387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the three transmembrane domains 1, 3, and 4 in MIT, ITR1, ITR2, AraE, GalP, and XylE (Fig. 6) revealed a significantly higher degree of conservation in helices 1 and 4 with 66.2 and 62.0% amino acid identity, respectively, compared with helix 3 with 44.9% identity. In helix 1, identity among the six proton symporters increases to 84.9% for the carboxyl-terminal half of the transmembrane domain (MIT G13-I23), which contains residue Asp19. Remarkable is a periodicity of three to four residues for the conservation pattern in helix 1 (Ala9–Gly13–Phe16–Asp19–Ile23) and helix 4 (Gly105–Gly109–Ser112–Pro116), suggestive of α-helical character and orientation along a conserved and functionally important stretch of the transmembrane segment, potentially part of the substrate permeation pathway. The Leishmania MIT is a member of the large sugar transporter superfamily, ranging from bacteria to plants and mammals, and this protozoan transporter serves as a model for active transporters in early eukaryotes. The bacterial disaccharide/cation symporters, lactose permease and melibiose permease, are usually grouped in a separate family, based on structural and functional data (35Maiden M.C.J. Davis E.O. Baldwin S.A. Moore D.C.M. Henderson P.J.F. Nature. 1987; 325: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 10Henderson P.J.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 590-601Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). For lac permease it was demonstrated that transmembrane domains 6–12 (designated C6) are sufficient to catalyze facilitative transport (18Wu J. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5213-5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and four charged transmembrane residues essential for transport function are located in C6. This is distinct from MIT, where charged residues important for function are in the NH2-terminal half of the carrier. However, four aspartate residues in the NH2-terminal half of the melibiose transporter are thought to be important for counterion binding (36Pourcher T. Zani M.-L. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3209-3215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), similar to the results obtained with MIT. Site-directed mutagenesis in the small number of transporters extensively studied has revealed that residues critical for transport activity are rather rare, and in the mammalian glucose transporter GLUT1 only two residues (Gln161 and Trp412) were found to greatly influence transport activity (37Mueckler M. Weng W. Kruse M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20533-20538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These residues lie within transmembrane domains 5 and 11, respectively, and support the idea based on ligand binding and labeling studies that the C-terminal part of GLUT1 may form the aqueous pore for the substrate permeation pathway (11Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 38Gould G.W. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). In MIT, however, transmembrane domains 1 and 4 appear to be important for substrate transport. The observation that either NH2-terminal or C-terminal half of the various transporters are implicated to align the substrate translocation pathway may be explained by the symmetrical arrangement of two six-helix bundles, derived from an internal gene duplication event in an ancestral six-transmembrane domain transporter (35Maiden M.C.J. Davis E.O. Baldwin S.A. Moore D.C.M. Henderson P.J.F. Nature. 1987; 325: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 11Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), where one of the two six-helix bundles retains the substrate translocation pathway in the modern 12-helix transporter. However, this hypothesis has been challenged recently by a photoaffinity labeling study of GLUT1 (39Lachaal M. Rampal A.L. Lee W. Shi Y. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5225-5230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) showing evidence that not only the carboxyl-terminal half but also the amino-terminal half of GLUT1 helices participates in the putative substrate channel formation. In this study, we have shown the importance of two transmembrane carboxylate residues for transport function in a protozoan proton symporter, similar to results observed with active transporters from bacteria. These residues may play a direct role in the transport of protons, although this conjecture remains to be proven. For most transporters, the location of the “permeation pathway” is still largely unknown. It is likely that Asp19 and Glu121 are on this permeation pathway in MIT. The results presented here suggest experiments to test the possibility that Asp19 and Glu121 are on this transport pathway, including systematic chemical modification of residues on putative transmembrane helices 1 and 4, both in the presence and absence ofmyo-inositol (40Akabas M.H.

https://openalex.org/W2075491499,"A neutral, bile salt-independent retinyl ester hydrolase (NREH) has been purified from a rat liver microsomal fraction. The purification procedure involved detergent extraction, DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange, Phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction, Sephadex G-100 and Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration chromatographies, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The isolated enzyme has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 66 kDa under denaturing conditions on SDS-PAGE. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of four peptides isolated after proteolytic digestion revealed that the enzyme is highly homologous with other rat liver carboxylesterases. In particular, the sequences of the four peptides of the NREH (60 amino acids total) were identical to those of a rat carboxylesterase expressed in the liver (Alexson, S. E. H., Finlay, T. H., Hellman, U., Svensson, L. T., Diczfalusy, U., and Eggertsen, G. (1994) J. Biol. Chem.269, 17118–17124). Antibodies against this enzyme also react with the purified NREH. Purified NREH shows a substrate preference for retinyl palmitate over triolein and did not catalyze the hydrolysis of cholesteryl oleate. With retinyl palmitate as substrate, the enzyme had a pH optimum of 7 and showed apparent saturation kinetics, with half-maximal activity achieved at substrate concentrations (K m) of approximately 70 μm. A neutral, bile salt-independent retinyl ester hydrolase (NREH) has been purified from a rat liver microsomal fraction.

With retinyl palmitate as substrate, the enzyme had a pH optimum of 7 and showed apparent saturation kinetics, with half-maximal activity achieved at substrate concentrations (K m) of approximately 70 μm. Hydrolysis of retinyl esters occurs during both the hepatic uptake of newly absorbed dietary vitamin A and during the mobilization of retinyl ester stores from the liver. Thus, hepatic enzymes catalyzing the hydrolysis of retinyl esters are important in the body's overall vitamin A homeostasis. Earlier studies focused on a neutral, bile salt-dependent retinyl ester hydrolase that is now understood to be the enzyme carboxylester lipase (see Ref. 1Harrison E.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar for a review). This enzyme is secreted by the pancreas into the intestinal lumen, where it can presumably hydrolyze dietary retinyl esters and other lipid esters (2Erlanson C. Borgstrom B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 167: 629-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 3Lombardo D. Guy O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 611: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 4Harrison E.H. Gad M.Z.

The enzyme is also secreted by the liver (6Winkler K.E. Harrison E.H. Marsh J.B. Glick J.M. Ross A.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and its role in hepatic retinyl ester metabolism is under investigation but is presently unclear. Carboxylester lipase has been cloned from several species, including the rat (see Ref. 7Wang C.-S. Harsuck J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar for a review). In addition to carboxylester lipase, a number of tissues contain bile salt-independent retinyl ester hydrolase activities that have as yet not been fully purified or characterized biochemically (4Harrison E.H. Gad M.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17142-17147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,8Napoli J.L. McCormick A.M. O'Meara B. Dratz E.A. Arch. Biochem.

For example, we have previously demonstrated the occurrence of both acid and neutral retinyl ester hydrolase activities associated with rat liver microsomal preparations enriched in plasma membranes and endosomes (4Harrison E.H. Gad M.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17142-17147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gad M.Z. Harrison E.H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 685-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently reported studies demonstrating the co-localization of newly delivered chylomicron retinyl esters and bile salt-independent retinyl ester hydrolase enzyme activities in the same plasma membrane/endosome fractions, and the in vitrohydrolysis of chylomicron remnant retinyl esters by these fractions (11Harrison E.H. Gad M.Z. Ross A.C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1498-1506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggested a probable role for these enzymes in the initial hepatic metabolism of chylomicron retinyl esters. In the present investigations, we have undertaken the purification and characterization of a neutral, bile salt-independent retinyl ester hydrolase from rat liver microsomes. The isolated enzyme has an apparent molecular mass of 66 kDa and catalyzes the hydrolysis of retinyl esters at higher rates than triglyceride hydrolysis. It shows no cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity. Partial amino acid sequence analysis and immunoblot analysis show that the enzyme is highly related to or identical to rat liver carboxylesterase ES-2. Cholesteryl [1-14C]oleate (1.96 GBq/mmol) and [1-14C] palmitic acid (2.22 GBq/mmol) were purchased from Amersham; [carboxyl-14C]triolein (4.1 GBq/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products; all-trans-retinol was from Sigma; octyl-β-d-thioglucopyranoside (OSGP) 1The abbreviations used are: OSGP, octyl-β-d-thioglucopyranoside; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NREH, neutral, bile salt-independent retinyl ester hydrolase; MH, microsomal hydrolase. was from Calbiochem; DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, Sephadex G-100, and Sephacryl S-200 were from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). All chemicals used for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were from Fisher Scientific; polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. Retinyl [1-14C]palmitate was synthesized as described by Prystowsky et al. (12Prystowsky J.H. Smith J.E. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4498-4503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was purified by chromatography on small columns of neutral alumina. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Ace Animal Inc., Boyertown, PA), weighing 150–250 g, were fed a commercial diet and water ad libitum. The animals were cared for in an American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)-certified animal care facility at the Medical College of Pennsylvania-Hahnemann School of Medicine. Rat liver microsomes were isolated as described previously (4Harrison E.H. Gad M.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17142-17147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the procedure developed by Amar-Costesec et al. (13Amar-Costesec A. Beaufay H. Wibo M. Thines-Sempoux D. Feytmans E. Robbi M. Berthet J. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Retinyl ester hydrolase activity was measured by the radioisotopic method as described in detail previously (4Harrison E.H. Gad M.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17142-17147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was modified by adding a final concentration of 1% OSGP and 0.1 mm bovine serum albumin per tube. The substrate used was retinyl [14C]palmitate (4 nmol and 0.05 μCi per assay, unless otherwise specified). In each assay, blank tubes (without enzyme) were measured to correct for spontaneous hydrolysis of substrate. An enzyme unit was defined as 1 pmol of retinyl [1-14C]palmitate hydrolyzed/min at 37 °C. Enzyme activity was expressed as units/mg or units/ml. Cholesteryl oleate and triolein hydrolysis activities were measured in the same assay system, using cholesteryl [1-14C]oleate and [carboxyl-14C]triolein as substrate, respectively. To solubilize the microsomal membrane-bound NREH, a 25% OSGP (w/v) stock solution was added slowly, with constant stirring, into freshly thawed microsomal pellet suspension (∼12 mg/ml) to a final concentration of 1% OSGP (w/v). Additionally, a 1 mTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) was added to give a final concentration of 10 mm Tris-HCl. The solution (called sample O+) was incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 42,000 rpm (213,000 × g) using a Ti 50.2 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C for 2 h. After centrifugation, a thin milky-white top layer (fatty materials) was discarded. Relative to the total retinyl palmitate hydrolysis activity in the original solution, the activities of each fraction were 2% top layer, 82% supernatant, and 16% pellet, and the relative amounts of protein were 1% top layer, 38% supernatant, and 61% pellet, indicating that OSGP efficiently solubilized NREH from crude microsomal membranes and led to a slight increase in enzyme specific activity in the solubilizate. The supernatant (called sample S) was collected and used for DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B ion exchange chromatography. OSGP-solubilized microsomal supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column previously equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 (hereafter referred to as column buffer). Unbound proteins were washed off with column buffer, and the column was then eluted with a gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl in column buffer. All of the column chromatography procedures were performed in a walk-in cold room unless otherwise specified. The pooled fractions with retinyl palmitate hydrolase activity from DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (designated as sample W) were first treated with ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 20% (w/v). Then the solution was incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm (17,350 × g) in a Ti 50.2 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C for 15 min. The suspension was collected and loaded onto a Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column equilibrated with column buffer containing 20% ammonium sulfate (w/v). The column was eluted as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The detergent/column buffer washing step was performed at room temperature. Sample WP2, having the highest specific retinyl ester hydrolase activity, was loaded into a Macrosep centrifugal concentrator tube (Filtron Technology Corp., Northborough, MA) with a molecular weight cut-off of 30,000 and centrifuged at 6,000 rpm (4,300 × g) using a SS-34 rotor in Sorvall RC-5B Plus centrifuge (DuPont) at 4 °C for 1 h. No retinyl palmitate hydrolase activity was found in the filtrate. The concentrated protein solution was then loaded onto Sephadex G-100 and Sephacryl S-200 columns connected in series and previously equilibrated with column buffer. Samples from different purification stages were electrophoresed using the Laemmli discontinuous buffer system (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). To estimate the purity and molecular mass of NREH, 10% SDS-PAGE gels (18 × 16 cm) were run at 60 V for 20 h and stained with silver. The estimated molecular mass of NREH was determined by comparison to the relative mobilities of marker proteins. Rat liver microsomal carboxylesterase ES-4 and the corresponding polyclonal antibody were prepared as described earlier (15Alexson S.E.H. Mentlein R. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody against mouse serum esterase ES-1 was a kind gift of Dr. Thomas H. Finlay (New York University Medical Center, New York, NY) (16Kadner S.S. Katz J. Finlay T.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Generation and characterization of antibodies against peptides corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal ends of ES-4 (12 amino acids) and ES-10 (13 amino acids) will be described in detail elsewhere. 2S. T. Engberg, A. Hellberg, and S. E. H. Alexson, manuscript in preparation. For Western blot analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose (Hybond-C, Amersham Corp). The membranes were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris/NaCl/Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibodies. The blots were washed in Tris/NaCl/Tween 20; after incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, the membranes were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.) and exposed to x-ray film. To analyze the peptide sequence of purified proteins, samples were applied onto a 10% SDS gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Amido Black (17Gershoni J.M. Palade G.E. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The membrane was sent to the Protein Microsequencing Facility of the Wistar Institute (Philadelphia, PA) for protease digestion and amino acid sequencing. Protein concentrations were determined by a modified Lowry method (18Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5356) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard, or assayed by the bicinchoninic acid method (19Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18792) Google Scholar). Two rat hepatic microsomal NREHs were purified by a sequence of procedures involving OSGP solubilization, DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange, Phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction, and Sephadex G-100 and Sepharose S-200 gel filtration chromatographies. OSGP was very efficient in releasing NREH from microsomal membranes (TableI). After anion exchange chromatography of the solubilizate on DEAE-Sepharose, NREH activity was recovered in a single peak in fractions eluted with a 0.0–0.3 m NaCl gradient elution (data not shown). The yield at this stage was 40%, with a 14-fold increase in specific activity over the starting microsomal suspension (Table I). The pooled active fractions were then further separated by Phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction column chromatography. Two peaks of NREH activity were resolved (Fig. 1). The first broad peak (designated as WP1) eluted with column buffer and a second sharp peak (designated as WP2) was eluted with column buffer containing 1% OSGP. Fraction WP2 showed a 87-fold increase in specific activity over the starting microsomal fraction and showed three bands on SDS-PAGE. The fractions pooled as WP2 were concentrated and loaded onto two columns of Sephadex G-100 and Sephacryl S-200 connected in series. After gel filtration, two peaks of activity peaks were again observed (Fig. 2). The first eluted peak was designated as GS21, and the second peak was designated GS22. Enzyme activity in the solubilizate and the purified enzyme (GS22) was stable when frozen. In contrast, some enzyme activity was lost during the ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatographies. At both of these steps, the activity in pooled and concentrated fractions (shown in Table I) was less than that accounted for by summing the activities in fractions as assayed directly off the columns. Thus it is useful to carry out these steps as quickly as possible.Table INeutral, bile salt-independent retinyl ester hydrolases purificationFractionVolumeProteinTotal proteinSpecific activityYield-Foldmlmg/mlmgunits/mg%nMicrosomal Crude (O+)108712.0513,097161001OSGP Extract (S)8555.734899531233DEAE-Sepharose (W)8310.453702244014Phenyl-Sepharose WP14050.072710501466 WP21100.0781387687Gel filtration GS21220.103809250 GS22360.04330785192 Open table in a new tab The purities of the NREHs were assessed by SDS-PAGE.

Sample GS21 contained two major bands corresponding to polypeptides with molecular masses of approximately 58 and 60 kDa. When analyzed by native gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions (data not shown), GS22 migrated as a single band of approximately 70 kDa and the GS21 preparation showed a broad band of high molecular mass (∼200 kDa). Four peptides obtained from the purified enzyme (GS22) were subjected to amino acid sequencing with the following results: peptide 1, FAPPEPAEPWSFVK; peptide 2, ESIPLEFSEDCLYLNIYSP; peptide 3, SFNTVPYIVGFNK; peptide 4, DAGAPTYMYEFQYR. These sequences match exactly those of rat liver carboxylesterase ES-2, as predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA for this enzyme that was recently determined by one of us (20Alexson S.E.H. Finlay T.H. Hellman U. Svensson L.T. Diczfalusy U. Eggertsen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17118-17124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the first eight amino acids of peptide 1 are identical to one of the peptide sequences obtained from purified rat serum esterase (20Alexson S.E.H. Finlay T.H. Hellman U. Svensson L.T. Diczfalusy U. Eggertsen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17118-17124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of the two protein bands in GS21 were also subjected to peptide sequencing. Two peptides derived from the lower band (see Fig. 3) had the following sequences: peptide 1, QEFGWIIPTLMGYPLSEGK; peptide 2, TVIGDHGDELFS. These two peptide sequences correspond exactly to sequences found in carboxylesterase ES-10 (also called the pI 6.1 carboxylesterase), as determined from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA for that enzyme (21Robbi M. Beaufay H. Octave J.N. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Finally, analysis of three peptides from the upper band in GS21 gave the following sequences: peptide 1, GPLLVQDVVFTDEMAHFDR; peptide 2, FYTEDGNWDLVGNNTPIFFIR; peptide 3, NYFAEVEQMAFD. These sequences correspond exactly to those found in the rat liver catalase monomer (22Furuta S. Hayashi H. Hijikata M. Miyazawa S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To clarify further the relationships of the preparations containing NREH activity and the major liver carboxylesterases, preparations were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies to various carboxylesterases. These included mouse carboxylesterases ES-1 (which cross-reacts with rat serum esterase ES-2), ES-4 (also called microsomal hydrolase (MH) or pI 6.4 carboxylesterase), and ES-10 (also called the pI 6.1 carboxylesterase). The anti-pI 6.1 and anti-pI 6.4 are rabbit antipeptide antibodies directed against the COOH-terminal ends of the respective enzymes, whereas the anti-serum esterase antibody is a polyclonal antibody raised against the mouse serum esterase. The results of these studies are shown in Fig.4. As shown on the left of this figure, one band in the GS21 preparation reacts with the anti-pI 6.1 (ES-10) antibody, whereas GS22 does not react with this antibody. As shown in the center of the figure, neither GS21 nor GS22 react with anti-pI 6.4 antibody, which reacts strongly with the purified pI 6.4 esterase. The right side of the figure shows the pattern of antibody reaction using anti-serum esterase. This antibody is not monospecific and reacts with both purified pI 6.4 enzyme (MH) and with the same band in GS21 as that which reacts with the anti-pI 6.1 antibody. Importantly, however, the antiserum esterase antibody reacts with a protein in rat serum that is the size of authentic serum esterase and with the purified NREH (GS22), which is of intermediate size. An antibody against catalase reacted only with the upper band of GS21 (data not shown). To characterize purified NREH, a number of experiments were carried out to study the pH dependence, substrate specificity, and enzyme kinetics. The enzyme activity of purified NREH (GS22) functioned from pH 4 to 8 with optimal activity at pH 7.0. The retinyl palmitate hydrolysis activity increased linearly with the incubation time for the first 60 min of the incubation, then gradually slowed down. Initial rates were observed over an enzyme concentration range of 1–6 μg of the purified NREH. Finally, kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of retinyl palmitate by purified NREH were determined with various substrate concentrations as shown in Fig. 5. The apparent kinetic parameters were estimated from Lineweaver-Burk plots;K m and V max were calculated to be 69 μm and 3.1 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. The purified NREH was tested for its substrate specificity to see whether this homogeneous enzyme had other ester hydrolysis activity. Purified NREH showed no hydrolysis activity against cholesteryl oleate. The maximal activity against triolein was about one-tenth that of the hydrolysis of retinyl palmitate under similar assay conditions. This indicates that the purified NREH preferred the retinyl ester as substrate and did not hydrolyze cholesteryl oleate. The studies reported here provide new information on the hepatic enzymes involved in the metabolism of retinyl esters. In addition, they suggest a possible new physiological role for two of the “nonspecific” carboxylesterases of rat liver. Although the enzymatic hydrolysis of retinyl esters plays a key role in both the hepatic uptake and the mobilization of vitamin A, understanding of the specific enzymes involved is limited. Early work focused on a bile salt-dependent NREH that is now recognized to be carboxylester lipase, a soluble enzyme secreted from the pancreas, liver, and breast of mammals (see Refs. 1Harrison E.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar and 7Wang C.-S. Harsuck J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar for reviews). Carboxylester lipase catalyzes the hydrolysis of a wide variety of lipid esters and is more active on cholesteryl esters, triacylglycerols, and lysophospholipids than on retinyl esters. In addition to carboxylester lipase, the liver and other tissues contain membrane-associated NREH activities that are active in the absence of exogenous bile salts in in vitro assays (4Harrison E.H. Gad M.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17142-17147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Napoli J.L. Pacia E.B. Salerno G.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,10Gad M.Z. Harrison E.H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 685-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22273-22278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that these membrane-associated enzymes may by important in the metabolism of retinyl esters. For example, Boerman and Napoli (23Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22273-22278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that apocellular retinol-binding protein directly activates the hydrolysis of endogenous retinyl esters in rat liver microsomes by a bile salt-independent NREH activity. Moreover, chylomicron retinyl esters newly delivered to the liver of intact rats are initially found localized in plasma membrane/endosomal fractions that also contain bile salt-independent NREH activity (11Harrison E.H. Gad M.Z. Ross A.C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1498-1506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These latter studies also demonstrated the hydrolysis in vitro of chylomicron retinyl esters by an NREH activity in these membranes. Despite the potential importance of the bile salt-independent NREHs in retinoid metabolism, little detailed information on their biochemical properties is available. Napoli and colleagues (9Napoli J.L. Pacia E.B. Salerno G.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) conducted the seminal work in this area by showing that the NREH activity of rat kidney microsomes could be effectively solubilized by the detergent, OSGP. Indeed, our initial attempts at enzyme solubilization built on their work. It is noteworthy that both groups found that the NREH activity could be solubilized in good yield with approximately a 3–4-fold increase in specific activity over the starting microsomes from both tissues. It is also of interest that Napoli et al.(9Napoli J.L. Pacia E.B. Salerno G.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) were able to resolve two partially purified kidney NREHs using a combination of gel filtration and ion exchange chromatographies. Although their preparations were only slightly enriched over the solubilized microsomes in NREH activity, even at that stage of purification the preparations were more active in catalyzing the hydrolysis of retinyl palmitate than triolein and showed no cholesteryl esterase activity. It seems likely that the preparations studied by these authors contained the carboxylesterases purified and characterized by us as NREHs. A significant aspect of the work reported here is the isolation in a homogeneous state of a bile salt-independent NREH (GS22) that shows specificity for retinyl esters over triglycerides and that does not catalyze the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters. This specificity suggests that the enzyme might be important in hepatic retinyl ester metabolism and hence in the body's overall economy of retinoid. The existence of a specific bile salt-independent NREH had been suggested by the work of Napoli et al. (9Napoli J.L. Pacia E.B. Salerno G.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) discussed above and by our previous studies using active site-directed inhibitors in whole microsomes (10Gad M.Z. Harrison E.H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 685-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also worth pointing out that the other partially purified NREH isolated in the current studies (GS21) also showed a substrate preference for retinyl esters over triglycerides and did not catalyze the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters. A final significant aspect of the work reported here is the demonstration of the probable identity of two bile salt-independent, microsomal NREHs with two of the major carboxylesterases expressed in rat liver. Although the older biochemical literature refers to more than 30 rat liver carboxylesterases, it is now appreciated that almost all of these enzyme activities are manifestations of the gene products of five major loci in linkage group V (24Mentlein R. Ronai A. Robbi M. Heymann E. von Deimling O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 913: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These esterases are referred to as ES-2 (also called serum esterase), ES-3 (also called the pI 5.6 esterase), ES-4 (also called the pI 6.2/6.4 esterase or microsomal hydrolase), ES-10 (also called the pI 6.0/6.1 esterase), and ES-15 (also called the pI 5.0/5.2 esterase). All of these enzymes have polypeptide monomer molecular masses of 58–65 kDa and all function catalytically as the monomer, except for esterase ES-10, which exists as a homotrimer in the native state (24Mentlein R. Ronai A. Robbi M. Heymann E. von Deimling O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 913: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All of these enzymes function as carboxylesterases (on a wide variety of oxyester substrates), whereas the microsomal hydrolase, ES-4, also functions as a thioesterase and catalyzes the hydrolysis of long-chain acyl-CoAs (15Alexson S.E.H. Mentlein R. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Mentlein R. Ronai A. Robbi M. Heymann E. von Deimling O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 913: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The results of our investigations strongly suggest that the two microsomal NREHs isolated here correspond to esterases ES-10 and ES-2. The evidence suggesting that the partially purified NREH contained in GS21 is esterase ES-10 comes from: 1) the size of the protein as assessed by gel filtration, native gel electrophoresis, and SDS-PAGE; 2) the partial amino acid sequence; and 3) its immunoreactivity. The proteins in GS21 elute early from gel filtration columns and migrate on native gel electrophoresis as a diffuse band with a molecular mass in the 200-kDa range. This is near the known sizes of the homotrimeric esterase ES-10 (180 kDa) and the tetrameric native catalase (240 kDa). Significantly, under denaturing conditions on SDS-PAGE, the preparation shows two distinct bands of molecular masses of approximately 58 and 60 kDa. The 58-kDa species contained amino acid sequences that matched exactly those found in ES-10, whereas the upper band contained sequences that matched exactly the catalase sequence. Finally, antipeptide antibodies directed at the COOH-terminal end of ES-10 specifically recognized the 58-kDa protein in GS21. Taken together, the results suggest that ES-10 (the pI 6.0/6.1 esterase) can function as a bile salt-independent retinyl ester hydrolase. Our results agree quite well with the studies of Mentlein and Heymann (25Mentlein R. Heymann E. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These authors studied the hydrolysis of retinyl palmitate in vitro by four purified, rat liver carboxylesterases, namely ES-3, ES-10, and the two forms (pI 6.2 and 6.4) of ES-4. Using a variety of substrate presentation forms (all of which were different from the assay used by us), they found that ES-4 enzyme showed the highest REH activity and that ES-10 showed lower activity (<10% of ES-4) under some conditions of substrate presentation. Our results obviously do not address the possibility that ES-4 is a NREH, because it is possible that this enzyme was present in the first peak of NREH activity that eluted from Phenyl-Sepharose (WP1), which we did not further characterize. It is clear, however, based on our Western blotting experiments, that neither preparation isolated by us contains ES-4. It appears that both ES-4 and ES-10 can function as NREHs. It is important to point out, however, that both of these enzymes are localized in endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles in the microsomal fraction, and both we (4Harrison E.H. Gad M.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17142-17147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gad M.Z. Harrison E.H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 685-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Harrison E.H. Gad M.Z. Ross A.C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1498-1506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Mentlein and Heymann (25Mentlein R. Heymann E. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) agree that most of the membrane-associated NREH activity in rat liver membranes is associated with plasma membrane/endosomal vesicles. An enzyme more likely to be localized in such vesicles might be the ES-2 or a related enzyme as discussed below. The highest NREH specific activity was associated with the nearly homogeneous protein in GS22. Evidence that this protein is identical to or highly related to the serum esterase ES-2 comes from two sources. First, the isolated NREH reacted with antibodies to the purified serum esterase (20Alexson S.E.H. Finlay T.H. Hellman U. Svensson L.T. Diczfalusy U. Eggertsen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17118-17124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although this evidence is suggestive of a high degree of relatedness of the NREH and ES-2, it does not prove that the two proteins are identical. This is especially true given that the anti-serum esterase antibodies used for the Western blots cross react with other related but distinct carboxylesterases such as ES-4 and ES-10 (Fig. 4). Although, in addition (as also shown in Fig. 4), the purified NREH runs slightly faster on SDS-PAGE than does the mature esterase in rat serum, this is probably because of the isolation of the serum esterase from intracellular sources in a precursor form, which undergoes further glycosylation before being secreted (26Yan B. Yang D. Bullock P. Parkinson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19128-19134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Second, there was complete identity of the amino acid sequences of four internal peptides (60 residues total) with sequences in ES-2, strongly suggesting that the two proteins are identical. If the NREH is identical to serum esterase, the enzyme may function on chylomicron retinyl esters at or near the cell surface in the space of Disse, as has been suggested for the metabolism of chylomicron remnants by other secreted lipases such as hepatic lipase and carboxylester lipase. If the NREH is a distinct enzyme (or a retained form of ES-2), it may be the plasma membrane/endosomal NREH studied previously in whole membrane preparations and thought to be important in hepatic retinyl ester metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W1986420181,"Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) have similar cell-surface receptors yet subserve different physiological functions. To examine whether these differences relate to intrinsic signaling properties of the intracellular domains of their respective receptors, chimeric receptors were constructed using the extracellular domain of the neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor, TrkC, and the intracellular domain of either the insulin receptor or the IGF-1 receptor. TrkC-IR (TIR) and TrkC-IGF-1R (TIGR) were stably expressed in 3T3-L1 cells. While TIR and TIGR cell lines expressing similar numbers of chimeric receptors showed a similar dose-response relationship in NT-3 stimulated DNA synthesis, NT-3 stimulated glycogen synthesis was greater in TIR than in TIGR cells (maximum TIGR response was 35% of maximum TIR response). Additionally, the concentration of NT-3 at which significant stimulation of glycogen synthesis was seen was 0.1 ng/ml in TIR and 1 ng/ml in TIGR cells. Basal levels of thymidine incorporation but not glycogen synthesis were consistently higher in TIR than in TIGR expressing cells. No detectable basal autophosphorylation of chimeric receptors was seen in any of the cell lines. However, exposure of cell lines to the phosphatase inhibitor bisperoxovanadate resulted in greater basal autophosphorylation of the TIR and endogenous murine IR than the TIGR and endogenous murine IGF-1R. Thus, in this system, the intracellular domain of the IR appears to couple more effectively to glycogen synthesis than that of the IGF-1R, whereas the intracellular domains of both receptors have a similar capacity to stimulate DNA synthesis. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) have similar cell-surface receptors yet subserve different physiological functions.

In the intact organism these hormones have significantly different physiological roles (for review, see Refs. 1Kahn C.R. Annu. Rev.

Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin primarily functions as a regulator of carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. In contrast, IGF-1 is largely a mediator of cell growth and differentiation primarily stimulating DNA synthesis and mitogenic events (4Cohick W.S. Clemmons D.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 5LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr.

Despite these different functions, the cell surface receptors for insulin and IGF-1 (IR and IGF-1R, respectively) are highly homologous. They are both Type II tyrosine kinase receptors with the same disulfide-linked heterotetrameric structure consisting of two extracellular α-subunits containing the ligand-binding domain and two transmembrane β-subunits with the ligand-sensitive tyrosine kinase activity (7Yarden Y. Ullrich A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 443-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). The greatest homology (over 80%) is found in the tyrosine kinase domain while differences in the ligand-binding domain (overall homology 44–60%) account for ligand specificity. The greatest sequence divergence between the two receptors is found in their C termini (44% identity) (8Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M. Collins C. Henzel W. Le Bon T.

The former studies have examined the catalytic activity of semipurified IRs versus IGF-1Rs toward different peptide substrates and have suggested that consistent differences may exist (32Xu B.

Issues such as cross-reactivity of the ligands for their non-cognate receptor and the formation of hybrid receptors may have complicated interpretation of previous studies. To overcome some of the inherent limitations in previous systems, we have constructed chimeric receptors using the extracellular and most of the transmembrane domain of the neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor TrkC (a monomeric transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase) and the intracellular domain of either the IR or IGF-1R. As TrkC is known to be activated by ligand-induced dimerization, it was anticipated that the monomeric chimera would be inactive in the absence of ligand. Neither TrkC nor NT-3 are expressed in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes, nor is there any biological response to NT-3 in these cells. Thus these chimeras have allowed us to examine the relative abilities of the intracellular domains of the IR and IGF-1R to stimulate glycogen versus DNA synthesis in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes in response to comparable degrees of receptor activation by a single ligand. Anti-IR and anti-IGF-1R antibodies were polyclonal antibodies raised to the C-terminal region of the IR and IGF-1R, respectively. Polyclonal anti-Trk C-terminal peptide antibody was as described (41Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Fukunaga R. Wood W. Goeddel D.V. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Bucks., United Kingdom). Unless otherwise stated, all biochemicals and cell culture materials were from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, UK) and general purpose laboratory reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from BDH (Poole, Dorset, UK).d-[14C]Glucose, [methyl-3H]thymidine, and Na125I were from Amersham (Ayelsbury, Buckinghamshire, UK). Parental 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Stably transfected 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were maintained in the same medium containing 550 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). CHO.IR cells are stably transfected CHO cells overexpressing the wild-type insulin receptor (42Ilondo M.M. Damholt A.B. Cunningham B.A. Wells J.A. De Meyts P. Shymko R.M.

These were maintained in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 600 μg/ml G418.

These were maintained in the same medium as wild-type 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce novel restriction sites in the transmembrane domain of the IR, IGF-1R, and TrkC. Mutants were generated using “Altered Sites II in vitro Mutagenesis System” (Promega). A DraI site was introduced into the TrkC cDNA using a mutagenic oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotides 2426–2451 (5′-CTTGTTGATCATTTTAAAGAGGACCA-3′; the DraI site is underlined and the mutated nucleotides are boldfaced). A SnaBI site was introduced into the IR cDNA using a mutagenic oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotides 2921–2954 (5′-TTGGAAGTATTTACGTATTCCTGAGAAA-3′; the SnaBI site is underlined and the mutated oligonucleotides are boldfaced). A SnaBI site was introduced into the IGF-1R cDNA using a mutagenic oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotides 2906–2926 (5′-TTCTATGGAATACGTACAGCA-3′; theSnaBI site is underlined and the mutated nucleotide is boldfaced). The DraI site does not alter any amino acids in the region of TrkC to be used in the chimeric receptor. TheSnaBI sites produce a conservative L938V change in the IR and no change in the IGF-1R. TrkC was then cleaved with DraI and the IR and IGF-1R with SnaBI followed by blunt-end ligation of the TrkC extracellular domain to the intracellular domain of either the IR or the IGF-1R producing the TIR and TIGR, respectively. The sequences of the transmembrane domains of the wild-type receptors are: IR, IIIGPLIFVFLFSVVIGSIYLFL; IGF-IR, LIIALPVAVLLIVGGLVIMLYVHF; and TrkC, FGVSIAVGLAAFACVLLVVLFIMI. The sequences of the transmembrane domains of the chimeric receptors are: TIR, FGVSIAVGLAAFACVLLVVLFV FL and TIGR, FGVSIAVGLAAFACVLLVVLFVHF, where the boldfaced residues are derived from the IR and IGF-IR, respectively, and the underlined residue represents the conservative L938V change in the IR. The chimeric receptors were subcloned into pRc/CMV (Invitrogen, Leek, Norway) for expression in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes from the cytomegalovirus promoter. The entire transmembrane domain and 300 flanking nucleotides of both chimeras were sequenced in the final vector. Semi-confluent 3T3-LI pre-adipocytes in 6-well dishes were transfected with 1.5 μg of either pRc/CMV/TIR or pRc/CMV/TIGR using 8 μl of the Lipofectamine reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Three days after transfection, selective media containing 550 μg/ml G418 was added. After 3 weeks of G418 selection, clonal lines were obtained by limiting dilution onto 96-well plates. G418-resistant clones expressing high levels of transfected receptor were selected by measurement of [125I]NT-3 binding. NT-3 was labeled according to the following protocol from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals: 4 μg of NT-3 were mixed with 0.5 μg of lactoperoxidase, 400 μCi of Na125I (2000 Ci/mmol), and H2O2 at a final concentration of 176 μm. All dilutions were done in 0.2m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. After 12 min (vortexing vigorously after 6 min), the reaction was terminated by addition of 30 μl of CIP buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, 1 mNaCl, 0.1 m NaI, pH 7.5). The entire volume was then transferred to a BSA-coated Eppendorf tube and the reaction vial flushed with a further 40 μl of 1–2% BSA (radioimmunoassay grade). Half of the total volume was diluted to 100 μl and spun through a Sephadex G-25 spin column to remove unincorporated label. Labeled NT-3 was found to have a specific activity of 2000–3000 cpm/fmol. [125I]NT-3 was stored at 4 °C and used within 2 weeks of preparation. All binding studies were performed overnight at 4 °C with shaking, using confluent 24-well plates with a total volume of 300 μl/well. For selection of high-expressing clones, cells were incubated with 24 pm [125I]NT-3, washed with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in 0.03% SDS. The radioactivity was measured in a NE1660 γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by preincubating the cells for 45 min with a 1000-fold excess of cold NT-3. It was found to account for maximally 10–20% of total binding. For displacement experiments, cells were incubated with 12 pm[125I]NT-3 and unlabeled NT-3 at concentrations between 0 and 600 pm. Confluent 4-well plates were incubated in serum-free media overnight followed by addition of ligand (insulin, IGF-1, or NT-3) for 5 min. In experiments using bisperoxovanadium phenanthroline (bpV(phen)), the cells were exposed to bpV(phen) for 10 min followed by 5 min with or without ligand. Cells were then washed once with ice-cold PBS, solubilized in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 30 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and clarified by centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 2 μl of either anti-IR or anti-IGF-1R antibody or 5 μl of anti-TrkC antibody plus 40 μl of a 5% slurry of protein A-agarose. After four washes with lysis buffer, pellets were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and boiled for 3 min. For analysis of total cell lysates, aliquots of lysate supernatant were mixed with sample buffer containing dithiothreitol. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% slab gels) and transferred by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was incubated in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 3% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. Blocking was followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 h with either anti-IR, anti-IGF-IR, or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5% BSA. The membrane was then washed for 30 min: 3 × 5 min with PBS, 0.1% Tween and 3 × 5 min with water. Washing was followed by incubation with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by another 30-min wash as described above. For detection by the ECL system (Amersham, Ayelsbury, Bucks., UK), the secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (or anti-rabbit) IgG (Dako Ltd., Denmark) diluted 1:10000 in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5% BSA. For detection using 125I, approximately 1 μCi of125I-labeled goat anti-mouse (or anti-rabbit) IgG (gift of Paul Bevan, Cambridge, UK) was used as secondary antibody. The washed filter was then exposed to x-ray film with an intensifier screen or exposed to a PhosphorImager plate. The results were viewed and quantified using a Fuji BAS2000 PhosphorImager. Glycogen synthesis was assessed by measuring d-[14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen. Confluent monolayers in 6-well dishes were serum-starved for 18 h followed by addition of either 0.001–10 ng/ml NT-3 or 100 nm insulin for 30 min and measurement ofd-[14C]glucose uptake as described (45Mothe I. Tartare S. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Kaliman P. Van Obberghen E. Ballotti R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The unlabeled glucose concentration was 5 mm. Confluent monolayers in 24-well dishes were serum-starved for 24 h in serum-free media. Cells were then washed in serum-free media followed by the addition of either 1 μm insulin or 0.001–1 μg/ml NT-3. After 22 h, thymidine incorporation was measured as described (46Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). To select an appropriate extracellular chimeric partner for these studies a number of ligands were examined to ensure they did not activate downstream signaling in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Both NGF and HGF were found to produce biological responses in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. In contrast, NT-3 did not stimulate glycogen synthesis or thymidine incorporation in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes (Fig. 1, A andB), while these processes responded to insulin and serum, respectively. Conditioned medium was harvested from 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and assayed for the presence of ligand that could activate TrkC in MG86/TrkC cells. There was no increase in TrkC phosphorylation in cells exposed to the supernatants suggesting these cells do not express NT-3 (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, TrkC was chosen as the receptor to be used in the construction of the chimeric receptors. Chimeric receptors consisting of the entire extracellular domain and 21 amino acids of the transmembrane domain of TrkC and the intracellular domain of the insulin or IGF-1 receptor (TIR and TIGR, respectively) were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV which also contains an SV40 promoter-driven G418 resistance gene. The resulting TIR and TIGR expression vectors were transfected into 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes followed by growth in G418 to generate a pool of stably transfected cells. To determine whether the chimeric receptors were correctly synthesized and expressed, total cell lysates from these pools were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, followed by anti-IR or anti-IGF-1R blotting of proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Fig.2). Both chimeric receptors were expressed and migrated on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 145–150 kDa. Neither receptor was expressed in parental 3T3-L1 cells while all cell lines expressed the IR and IGF-1R. We examined the functionality of the chimeric receptors in the pools of stably transfected 3T3-L1 stimulated with NT-3. In the absence of suitable antibody to immunoprecipatate chimeric receptors via TrkC extracellular domain, receptors were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to the intracellular domain of the IR or IGF-1R then immunoblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig.3). The anti-IR and anti-IGF-1R antibodies both recognized the respective endogenous murine receptors but they could be clearly distinguished from the chimeric receptor because of major size differences. Both the TIR and TIGR showed NT-3-dependent autophosphorylation of the chimeric receptor but not of the endogenous insulin or IGF-1 receptor. NT-3 also stimulated autophosphorylation of TrkC in MG86/TrkC cells while insulin and IGF-1 stimulated autophosphorylation of their cognate receptor in CHO.IR and 3T3/IGF-1R cells, respectively. Limiting dilution of the 3T3-L1 pool was used to generate several independent G418-resistant clonal cell lines expressing the TIR or TIGR. [125I]NT-3 binding was used to select clones expressing high levels of chimeric receptor and to identify pairs of clones expressing similar levels of TIR and TIGR. Each pair was analyzed in triplicate on at least two different occasions with MG86/TrkC cells and parental 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes as positive and negative controls, respectively. Two pairs of clones were selected for use in further studies: TIGR1/TIR1 and TIGR2/TIR2 where both clones of each pair bound similar amounts of [125I]NT-3 (data not shown). The displacement of [125I]NT-3 tracer by unlabeled NT-3 was comparable in the pairs of TIR versus TIGR clones (Fig.4). We then examined the dose-response of NT-3-induced chimera autophosphorylation in the paired clones. Serum-starved cells were incubated for 5 min with 0.1–1000 ng/ml NT-3 followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-IR or anti-IGF-1R antibody and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Fig. 5). Paired clones showed a similar dose-response to NT-3 reaching a maximum at 100 ng/ml. Chimera autophosphorylation was reduced at the higher NT-3 concentration of 1000 ng/ml, a finding consistent with the known properties of transmembrane receptors which are dimerized by ligand (47Lawrence J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Shepherd P.R. Navé B.T. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The paired clones TIGR1/TIR1 and TIGR2/TIR2 were then used to compare the effect of NT-3 on glycogen synthesis in cells (Fig.6). Serum-starved cells were exposed to various concentrations of NT-3 for 30 min followed by a 1.5-h pulse ofd-[U-14C]glucose. Results are shown separately for each of the matched pairs and represent the mean results from three independent experiments. Parental 3T3-L1 cells did not respond to NT-3 but glycogen synthesis was stimulated by NT-3 in both pairs of chimeric expressing cell lines. The dose-response curves show that, in both pairs, NT-3 stimulated glycogen synthesis was greater in TIR than in TIGR expressing clones. The maximal response seen in both TIR1 and TIR2 was almost 3 times that of TIGR1 and TIGR2, respectively. Additionally, the concentration at which significant stimulation of glycogen synthesis was seen was 10-fold higher in TIGR1 and TIGR2 than in TIR1 and TIR2 (1 versus 0.1 ng/ml). All clones showed a similar response to 100 nm insulin suggesting that the differences seen are specific to NT-3. The effect of NT-3 on thymidine incorporation in TIGR1/TIR1 and TIGR2/TIR2 was also examined. Serum-starved cells were exposed to various concentrations of NT-3 for 22 h followed by a 1.5-h pulse of [methyl-3H]thymidine. Parental 3T3-L1 cells did not respond to NT-3 but [3H]thymidine incorporation was stimulated by NT-3 in both pairs of chimeric expressing cell lines (Fig. 7). In contrast to the studies of glycogen synthesis, the dose-response characteristics of DNA synthesis were comparable in both pairs of TIR versus TIGR expressing clones. All clones showed a similar response to 1 μminsulin. While the NT-3 dose-response of thymidine incorporation was very similar in TIR and TIGR expressing clones, a consistent increase in basal levels of thymidine incorporation (but not glycogen synthesis) was seen in the TIR versus TIGR expressing clones. The basal levels of thymidine incorporation in TIGR clones were around 4000 dpm (approximately 2% of maximal NT-3 response), whereas in TIR clones the basal levels of thymidine incorporation were around 20,000 dpm (approximately 10% of maximal NT-3 response). These differences in basal levels of thymidine incorporation were not associated with parallel differences in cell proliferation as the doubling times of all cell lines was similar (data not shown). The differences on basal levels of thymidine incorpora"

A fourth open reading frame of the operon encodes a putative protein, NarJ, which is not present in purified nitrate reductase, but is required for biogenesis of the membrane-bound complex. NarJ was identified with a T7 expression system and was produced at significantly less than stoichiometric levels relative to the three enzyme subunits. A functional His-tagged NarJ fusion protein was overexpressed from a multicopy plasmid, purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography, and characterized. Western blot analysis with antibodies raised against the fusion protein demonstrated that NarJ remained in the cytosol after assembly of the active membrane complex. The cytosolic αβ complex accumulated in anarJ insertion mutant was rapidly degraded after induction, but was stabilized by NarJ expressed from a multicopy plasmid. Overproduction of the His-tagged NarJ fusion protein in the same mutant led to the formation of an αβ·NarJ complex, which was resolved by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The NarJ protein therefore has the properties of a system-specific (private) chaperone that reacts directly with and modifies the properties of the cytosolic αβ subunit complex, but remains in the cytoplasm after the assembly of the active αβγ complex in the membrane.

Respiratory nitrate reductase in Escherichia coli is a membrane-bound electron transfer complex that is composed of three subunits, α, β, and γ, encoded by the narG,narH, and narI genes of the narGHJIoperon, respectively (1Stewart V.

The α and β subunits are hydrophilic proteins that contain molybdopterin and non-heme iron cofactors and the active site for nitrate reduction. In the membrane complex, these subunits are tightly associated with the hydrophobic γ subunit, a hemeprotein (cytochrome b NR) that is required for the transfer of electrons from physiological donors through the membrane quinone pool to nitrate (4Enoch H.G.

In anarJ mutant, the γ subunit was inserted normally into the membrane, whereas the αβ complex accumulated in the cytosol in a form that contained a normal complement of cofactors, but was completely inactive (10Blasco F. Pommier J. Augier V. Chippaux M. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, the αβ complex that accumulated in narI mutants in the presence of NarJ appeared to express low levels of reduced methyl viologen-nitrate reductase activity (9Dubourdieu M. DeMoss J.A.

These results suggested that, during the biogenesis of nitrate reductase, NarJ may modify the αβ complex or facilitate its interaction with the membrane-bound γ subunit. It was not clear, however, whether NarJ was a subunit of the complex that was lost during the purification procedures or a chaperone-like component that was required only for assembly of the complex. The experiments presented here were undertaken to identify and localize NarJ in the cell and to clarify its possible role in the expression of nitrate reductase.

A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar), were maintained on L-broth (13Lennox E.S. Virology. 1955; 1: 190-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). For strains bearing plasmids, the medium was supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, or 25 μg/ml tetracycline as required. Plasmids pSL962 (narGHJI), pMV4 (narJI), and pES203.1 (narJ) were previously described (2Sodergren E.J. Hsu P.Y. DeMoss J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16156-16162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pGP1-2 (KanR, T7 RNA polymerase) and the AmpRT7 expression vectors pT7-4 and pT7-6 were as described by Tabor and Richardson (12Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). The CamR T7 expression vector pSU24 was kindly supplied by Valley Stewart (Cornell University). Specific fragments of the narGHJI operon were subcloned into a polycloning site behind the T7 promoter of the T7 expression vectors as diagrammed in Fig. 1 A. To construct plasmid pXL241, a 7186-base pair fragment containing the narGHJI genes, isolated on an agarose gel after digestion of plasmid pSL962 withEcoRI (partial) and DraI (complete), was ligated with plasmid pSU24 previously digested with SmaI andEcoRI. To construct plasmid pXL243, a 1166-base pair fragment containing the narJ open reading frame, isolated on agarose after digestion of plasmid pMV4 with PstI andXmnI, was ligated with plasmid pSU24 previously digested with PstI and SmaI. For construction of plasmids pXL742 and pXL762, a 2162-base pair fragment containing thenarJI open reading frames, isolated after digestion of pMV4 with PstI and EcoRI, was ligated with pT7-4 and pT7-6, respectively, previously digested with PstI andEcoRI. For construction of plasmids pXL744 and pXL746, a 1559-base pair fragment containing the narI open reading frame, isolated after digestion of pMV4 with BamHI andEcoRI, was ligated with pT7-4 and pT7-6, respectively, previously digested with BamHI and EcoRI. The structure of each constructed plasmid, isolated from colonies of strain MV1190 transformed to ampicillin resistance, was confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping. To construct plasmids expressing the His-tagged NarJ fusion protein, aHindIII-EcoRI fragment carrying thenarJI open reading frames was subcloned into phagemid pTZ19R (Bio-Rad), and the sequence around the translation initiation codon onnarJ was modified by site-directed mutagenesis to create aNcoI restriction site. This modification (A to G at nucleotide 4 of the open reading frame) resulted in the substitution of Val for Ile at residue 2 of the putative NarJ protein and had no effect on the ability of the plasmid to complement a narJ mutant. The resulting plasmid was digested with NcoI, the ends were blunted by the Klenow filling reaction, and two fragments were produced by digestion with XmnI (narJ open reading frame) and EcoRI (narJI open reading frames), respectively. The narJ fragment was ligated with plasmid pTrcHis (Invitrogen) that had been digested with BamHI, followed by the Klenow filling reaction. In the resulting plasmid, pXLJ-His6, the entire modified narJ sequence was fused in-frame to an open reading frame that encoded a 36-residue peptide containing 6 sequential His residues and a enterokinase cleavage site. The narJI fragment was ligated with pTrcHis treated as described above but in addition digested withEcoRI. In the resulting plasmid, pXLIJ-His6, the same fused narJ open reading frame was constructed followed by the narI open reading frame. The general structure of each of these plasmids was confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping. The selective expression of thenarGHJI components from the T7 promoter was carried out essentially as described by Tabor and Richardson (12Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar) in strain K38(pGP1-2) transformed with the recombinant T7 expression plasmids described above. The strains were grown in 5 ml of L-broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and either 100 μg/ml ampicillin or 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol to 150 Klett units (540-nm filter), treated essentially as described (12Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar), and labeled with [35S]methionine (5 μC/ml) at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, dissolved in SDS sample buffer (16 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4% SDS, 2% glycerol, and 0.0008% bromphenol blue), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. followed by autoradiography. The same procedure was followed for the pulse-chase experiment except that 0.1% nonradioactive methionine was added after the 5-min labeling period and the incubation continued at 30 °C. Aliquots were removed at 10-min intervals and analyzed as described above. Crude extracts of cells were prepared by passing cells suspended in Buffer A (20 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone) through a French press twice at 15,000 p.s.i. and removing cell debris by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 10 min. To determine the localization of nitrate reductase components, crude extracts were centrifuged for 90 min at 100,000 × g. The resulting supernatants were assumed to represent the cytosolic fraction, and the pellets suspended in the same volume of Buffer A represented the membrane fraction. Strain MV1190(pXLJ-His6) was grown on a rotary shaker at 37 °C in 100 ml of L-broth to midlog phase (150 Klett units, 540-nm filter); 1 mm IPTG was added; and the culture was grown for an additional 3 h. A crude extract was prepared as described above, and the overproduced fusion protein was purified on a 2-ml column of Ni2+-charged ProBond resin (Invitrogen) washed two times with 10 ml of Buffer A. The crude extract (10 ml) was loaded by gravity, and the unabsorbed proteins were removed by washing with 50 ml of Buffer A. The column was then eluted consecutively with 10-ml volumes of Buffer B (Buffer A at pH 6.0) supplemented with 0.8, 8, 40, 80, and 300 mmimidazole. Fractions (1.0 ml) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the peak fractions containing the fusion protein were pooled, concentrated on an Amicon filtration unit, and finally washed and suspended in water. The affinity-purified sample was further resolved by chromatography on a Sephadex G-100 column (1 × 57 cm) that was equilibrated and run with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mmEDTA at a rate of 2 ml/h. The column was calibrated with a mixture of standard proteins (50 μg each of bovine serum albumin, carbonic anhydrase, and cytochrome c plus 5 μg of blue dextran in 200 μl). To remove most of the N-terminal peptide containing the polyhistidine tag from the fusion protein, samples of the purified fusion protein was digested overnight at 37 °C with calf intestine enterokinase (Biozyme Laboratories International Ltd.) in 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 5 mm CaCl2, and the resulting products were purified by gel filtration on the Sephadex G-100 column described above. The N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined on an Applied Biosystems Model 477A gas-phase sequencer by Chris Chen in the Analytical Chemistry Center of this institution. Protein masses were determined with the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry system in the Analytical Chemistry Center. Protein was determined by the procedure of Lowry et al. (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or was followed by absorption at 280 nm. SDS-PAGE was carried out on gels prepared and run according to the procedures of Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Whole cells or proteins were dissolved in SDS sample buffer and heated for 3 min at 95 °C before loading. If necessary, the undissolved residue from cells was removed by brief centrifugation. Antisera against the purified NarJ-His6 fusion protein were produced commercially by Bethyl Laboratories, and specific antibodies used for Western blot analyses were purified by the procedure of Olmstead (16Olmstead J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Purified antibodies against the α and β subunits of nitrate reductase were from an earlier study (9Dubourdieu M. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 867-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were purified by the same procedure. Western blot analyses employed detection by enhanced chemiluminescence following the protocol described by the manufacturer (Amersham International). After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred from gels to nitrocellulose paper with a semi-dry Electroblotter (Millipore). The washing and labeling procedures were as described using horseradish peroxidase-labeled second antibodies. Purified nitrate reductase used as standard was prepared previously (2Sodergren E.J. Hsu P.Y. DeMoss J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16156-16162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The four open reading frames of thenarGHJI operon (2Sodergren E.J. Hsu P.Y. DeMoss J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16156-16162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Blasco F. Iobbi C. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Bonnefoy V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) encode proteins with calculated masses of 140 kDa (narG, α subunit), 58 kDa (narH, β subunit), 26.5 kDa (narJ), and 25.5 kDa (narI, γ subunit). To identify NarJ, fragments of the narGHJIoperon were cloned into T7 expression vectors (Fig.1 A) and selectively expressed in the presence of [35S]methionine as described under “Materials and Methods.” Parallel constructions were made for each fragment in vectors with the β-lactamase gene oriented in opposite directions so that the processed fragments of β-lactamase could be identified and used as internal controls. When the narJ and narI genes were expressed together in cells carrying either plasmid pXL742 or pXL762, two bands corresponding to apparent 29- and 23-kDa proteins were observed (Fig.1 B, lanes 3and 4) along with β-lactamase and its processed fragments (lane 1). The 23-kDa band was identical to that observed for the narI gene product expressed alone from plasmids pXL744 and pXL764 (lanes 5and 6), whereas the 29-kDa band, which apparently corresponded to NarJ, migrated closely to one of the processed products of the β-lactamase gene (lanes 1and 3). Although the putative NarJ protein migrated with an apparent mass that was higher than expected, its expression from pXL762 (lane 4), which contained the β-lactamase gene oriented in the opposite direction, confirmed its identification as the narJgene product. The level of NarJ appeared to be significantly less than that of NarI when both were expressed from the same plasmid, even when adjusted for the 3:1 (NarI/NarJ) ratio of methionine content. A fragment expressing NarJ only and one expressing all four operon proteins were also cloned into the T7 expression vector pSU24 (Fig.1 A). The selective marker for this vector, cat, encodes a product that is not processed and migrates faster than NarJ on SDS-PAGE, facilitating the identification of NarJ in the selective expression system (Fig. 1 C). NarJ appeared to be formed in less than stoichiometric amounts relative to the levels of NarI (γ subunit) even when expressed with the entire operon (fifththrough eighth lanes) and at even lower levels when expressed alone (firstthrough fourth lanes). The pulse-chase experiment shown in Fig. 1 C demonstrated that the turnover rate of NarJ was not significantly different from those of the other subunits, eliminating a rapid turnover rate as the explanation for the relatively low levels of NarJ. We conclude that NarJ migrates on SDS-PAGE less rapidly than would be predicted from its mass calculated from the narJ DNA sequence. It appeared to be produced with the T7 expression system at less than stoichiometric levels compared with the other products of thenarGHJI operon in amounts that were not compatible with the development of a facile purification procedure. To facilitate the purification of NarJ, thenarJ gene was cloned into a vector to create a fused protein with a polyhistidine tag as described under “Materials and Methods.” The resulting plasmid, pXLJ-His6, encoded a protein with a 36-residue peptide, containing six tandem His residues and an enterokinase cleavage site, fused to the N-terminal Met of the NarJ sequence. Induction of expression of the fused gene by IPTG in a wild-type strain carrying plasmid pXLJ-His6 led to the overexpression of an apparent 33-kDa protein, which was located almost exclusively in the supernatant fraction after high speed centrifugation of crude extracts (data not shown). The His-tagged NarJ fusion protein functionally replaced NarJ for expression of nitrate reductase in a narJ mutant. Mutant MD100 produces only α and β subunits and no nitrate reductase activity as the result of an insertion in the narJ gene (9Dubourdieu M. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 867-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformation of MD100 with pXLJ-His6 or an analogous plasmid, pXLIJ-His6, which encoded NarI as well as the His-tagged NarJ fusion protein, led to the expression of nitrate reductase activities on plate assays (17Glaser J.H. DeMoss J.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 116: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) similar to those formed with MD100 transformed with plasmids expressing NarJ and NarJ plus NarI (9Dubourdieu M. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 867-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The His-tagged fusion protein was readily purified on a Ni2+ affinity column (Fig.2 A). The overproduced fusion protein appeared to be partially cleaved by endogenous proteases following breakage of cells in the French press (lanes 2and3). Much of the overproduced fusion protein and its major cleavage products were absorbed to the Ni2+ resin and eluted by increasing concentrations of imidazole. After most of the contaminating proteins were washed off the column at lower imidazole concentrations (lanes 5–8), the fusion protein and its cleavage products were eluted at 300 mm imidazole (lanes 9–13). The pool of the peak fractions, concentrated and desalted, contained three major components (I–III) on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). N-terminal sequence analysis yielded only one sequence, GGSHHHHHHG, which corresponded to that expected for residues 2–11 of the peptide containing the polyhistidine and enterokinase cleavage site motifs. The mass of the largest component (30,639 Da), determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, corresponded reasonably closely to that calculated for the fusion protein with the N-terminal Met removed (30,315 Da). Because only one N-terminal sequence was observed for the fraction that was absorbed and eluted from the Ni2+ resin, it seemed most likely that the other two smaller fragments were generated by removal of C-terminal sequences, leaving the N-terminal sequence intact. Treatment of the pooled purified fraction with enterokinase generated three smaller fragments (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). N-terminal sequence analysis revealed only one N-terminal sequence, DRWGSMVLV, which corresponded to the last 5 residues of the fusion peptide and the first 4 residues of the narJ open reading frame. This result indicated that all three peptides contained the same N-terminal sequence after enterokinase cleavage. The mass of the largest fragment resulting from enterokinase cleavage (23,525 Da), as determined by mass spectroscopy, corresponded closely to the mass calculated for the cleavage of protein III at the enterokinase site (23,232 Da). These results verify that the purified protein is the expected His-tagged NarJ fusion protein. In extracts, the fusion protein appears to be very sensitive to endogenous proteases, which degrade the protein mainly in the C-terminal region. The undegraded form of His-tagged NarJ was resolved from most of the partially degraded forms by gel filtration under nondenaturing conditions (Fig. 3 A). The affinity-purified protein was resolved into two peaks. Peak I eluted at a position that corresponded to a dimer (66 kDa) and was composed almost exclusively of the undegraded 33-kDa form of the protein (Fig.3 B). Peak II eluted at the monomeric position and appeared to contain both undegraded and degraded forms (Fig. 3 B). Western blots employing antisera prepared against His-tagged NarJ demonstrated that little, if any, proteolysis of the fusion protein occurred in vivo (Fig. 4). The purified antiserum did not significantly cross-react with other proteins in the cell extracts (lanes 2and 3), and only the intact protein was visualized in cells that overproduced the His-tagged protein (lanes 4and 5). NarJ, produced at relatively low levels under most conditions, could also be visualized on Western blots using the antiserum prepared against the His-tagged protein. In Fig.5 A, low levels of NarJ were observed in extracts of wild-type cells (lane 2) and significantly increased levels in strains expressing NarJ from multicopy plasmids (lanes 4and 5). The band identified as NarJ was not present in cells of mutant MD100 (lane 3), which contains an insertionally inactivated narJgene. When crude extracts from the wild-type strain RK4353 were fractionated by high speed centrifugation, essentially all of the NarJ protein was present in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 5 B). Under these same conditions, the nitrate reductase subunits, as assessed by Western blotting with antibodies against the α and β subunits, were located chiefly in the membrane fraction (9Dubourdieu M. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 867-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although NarJ is not associated with the assembled membrane-bound nitrate reductase complex, it seemed possible that it interacted directly with an intermediate in the assembly pathway. Previous studies with mutants (9Dubourdieu M. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 867-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,10Blasco F. Pommier J. Augier V. Chippaux M. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) had established that, in the absence of the integral membrane γ subunit, the α and β subunits accumulated as a dimeric complex. In the absence of NarJ, this complex had a normal complement of cofactors (10Blasco F. Pommier J. Augier V. Chippaux M. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but was completely devoid of reduced methyl viologen-nitrate reductase activity. In the presence of NarJ, the complex expressed significant reduced methyl viologen-linked activity, but at very reduced levels (15–20%) compared with that of the membrane-bound complex (9Dubourdieu M. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 867-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, the presence of NarJ appeared to stabilize the αβ complex that accumulated in the absence of the γ subunit. In this experiment, mutant MD100 was grown aerobically to midlog phase and then shifted to anaerobic conditions with the addition of nitrate to induce expression of the two subunits, and the levels of the complex were assessed in extracts of cell samples by Western blotting using anti-α subunit antibodies. In wild-type strains, this induction procedure leads to the rapid formation of nitrate reductase activity, with steady-state specific activities being reached in ∼90 min (18Edwards E.S. Rondeau S.S. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In MD100 (Fig.6 A), the α subunit accumulated rapidly, reaching a maximum in 60 min and then declining after 90 min. To examine the effects of NarJ on the accumulation of the complex, MD100 was transformed with plasmids that expressed either NarJ (pES203.1) or NarJ and NarI (pMV4) under the control of the tac promoter (9Dubourdieu M. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 867-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and induction was carried out with the addition of IPTG to simultaneously induce these components. When both NarJ and NarI were induced with the α and β subunits (Fig. 6 C), the α subunit levels increased for 60 min and then remained constant, as might be expected for the formation of the stable, membrane-bound complex. Similarly, the induction of NarJ alone with the α and β subunits led to the stabilization of the accumulated α subunits (Fig. 6 B). This result suggested that NarJ may react directly with and stabilize the αβ complex prior to its interaction with the membrane-inserted γ subunit. To look directly for an αβ·NarJ complex, we took advantage of the special characteristics of the functionally active His-tagged NarJ fusion protein. The αβ complex and His-tagged NarJ were co-induced in strain MD100(pXLJ-His6), and the resulting cells were processed and fractionated as described above for the overproduced His-tagged fusion protein. SDS gels prepared from the fractions were stained directly for protein (Fig.7 A) or blotted and separate regions of the paper stained with specific antisera against the α and β subunits (Fig. 7 B) or His-tagged NarJ (Fig.7 C). In this short induction procedure, His-tagged NarJ was not overproduced to the same degree as in the cultures used for purification, but based on both the protein stain and the Western blot (Fig. 7, A and C), it is clear that the fusion protein was absorbed and eluted in an almost completely undegraded form. The α and β subunits, induced at much lower levels, were also absorbed to the Ni2+ affinity column and eluted at high imidazole concentrations in the same fractions with His-tagged NarJ (Fig. 7 B). A presumed partially degraded form of the α subunit, also present in the eluted fractions, was apparently formed during the column procedure since it was not present in the crude extract (lane 3). A similar induction and fractionation procedure was carried out with strain MD100(pES203.1), which produced both NarJ and the αβ complex; in this case, most of the NarJ protein and α and β subunits were not absorbed to the column, and the remainder of each was washed off at low concentrations of imidazole (data not shown). These results demonstrate that overproduced His-tagged NarJ formed a complex with the αβ complex that was sufficiently stable to be purified by binding to and elution from the Ni2+ affinity resin. The narJ gene is the third of four contiguous open reading frame in the narGHJI operon, and its start and stop codons overlap by 1 base pair each of the adjacent open reading frames (19Sodergren E.J. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1721-1729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, this type of overlapping structure has been thought to lead to translational coupling and the formation of similar amounts of each of the operon products (20Schumperli D. McKenney K. Sobieski D.A. Rosenberg M. Cell. 1982; 30: 865-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This did not seem to be the case for the NarJ protein; less than stoichiometric levels of NarJ accumulated with the T7 expression system compared with thenarG, narH, and narI gene products even though NarJ appeared to be just as stable as the other operon proteins. Furthermore, only low levels of NarJ could be accumulated when fragments containing the narJ gene were expressed from multicopy plasmids under the control of the tac promoter. These results suggested that, relative to the other operon products, the expression of NarJ is restricted at the level of translation and that less than stoichiometric levels of NarJ are required for the assembly of nitrate reductase. Based on its properties, the NarJ protein would appear to fit the formal definition of a molecular chaperone. It is a protein that is required for the assembly of the nitrate reductase complex on the membrane; it forms a complex with the α and β subunits prior to their assembly with the membrane-integrated γ subunit; and after assembly of the αβγ complex on the membrane, NarJ remains in the cytosol. In contrast to general molecular chaperones (21Ellis R.J. Nature. 1987; 328: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), NarJ would have to be defined as a system-specific chaperone since it appears to be required only for the biogenesis of nitrate reductase. As a component of thenarGHJI operon, it is expressed only when nitrate reductase formation is induced, and its deletion appears to have little effect on the growth and physiology of the affected cells except that which is attributable to the absence of functional nitrate reductase. Genes related to narJ have been identified in other operons that encode membrane-bound nitrate reductase complexes (22Berks B.C. Page M.D. Richardson D.J. Reilly A. Cavill A. Outen F. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 23Hoffmann T. Troup B. Szabo A. Hungerer C. Jahn D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 131: 219-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Blasco F. Iobbi C. Ratouchniak J. Bonnefoy V. Chippaux M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 222: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), but data base searches have not revealed significant homologies to any other known genes that might provide clues concerning the role of NarJ or its homologues in the biogenesis of nitrate reductase. What possible role might NarJ play in the assembly of the nitrate reductase complex? Previous studies have established that a cytoplasmic αβ complex, accumulated in mutants that produce no membrane-integrated γ subunit, is partially active when NarJ is present, but is inactive in mutants that lack NarJ as well (9Dubourdieu M. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 867-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Blasco F. Pommier J. Augier V. Chippaux M. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). When purified, the inactive form contained a full complement of cofactors (10Blasco F. Pommier J. Augier V. Chippaux M. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and appeared to be readily degraded by endogenous (9Dubourdieu M. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 867-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and exogenous (10Blasco F. Pommier J. Augier V. Chippaux M. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) proteases. The αβ complex accumulated in the presence of NarJ catalyzed the reduced methyl viologen-nitrate reductase reaction at ∼15–20% the rate catalyzed by the membrane-bound complex (9Dubourdieu M. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 867-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it appeared to be less sensitive to endogenous protease degradation than the inactive αβ complex accumulated in the absence of NarJ (9Dubourdieu M. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 867-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Palmer et al. (25Palmer T. Santini C.-L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1969; 20: 875-884Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar) have shown recently that, during the in vitroincorporation of molybdopterin cofactor, NarJ is one of the components required to form active nitrate reductase. Together, these observations suggest that NarJ facilitates a maturation or refolding of the inactive αβ complex to an active, protease-resistant complex. Since the inactive αβ complex does not form a complex with the membrane-bound γ subunit in the absence of NarJ (9Dubourdieu M. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 867-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Blasco F. Pommier J. Augier V. Chippaux M. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it seems likely that either the active “matured” form of αβ or the form bound to NarJ is required for interaction with the membrane-integrated γ subunit and assembly of the active αβγ complex. A detailed characterization of the structure and activity of the αβ·NarJ complex should provide more definitive information about the steps involved in assembly of nitrate reductase and the role of NarJ in this process. Putative system-specific or “private” chaperones have been identified for several other unrelated systems, including extracellular lipase formation (limA) in Pseudomonas cepacia(26Hobson A.H. Buckley C.M. Aamand J.L. Jorgensen S.T. Diderichsen B. McConnell D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In each case, the identified component, like NarJ, is required for assembly or processing, but is not found associated with or required for activity or function of the final product. None of these system-specific chaperones have structural features or apparent activities in common that might imply general functional homologies. It is possible that, in each case, a specific problem in biogenesis can be solved only by the participation of a specific protein factor. It is also possible that some general function is shared by these factors, such as protection or formation of otherwise reactive intermediates in the assembly process or facilitation of an interaction of intermediates with the general molecular chaperones of the cell to complete folding steps that are critical to the assembly process. After completion of this manuscript, we learned that Giordano et al. 2G. Giordano and F.

The protective effects of β-carotene and, possibly, other carotenoids against certain chronic diseases such as cancer (1Ziegler R.G. Subar A.F. Craft N.E. Ursin G. Peterson B.H. Graubard B.I.

Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (4331) Google Scholar). In addition, carotenoids serve as biological precursors of vitamin A (5Goodman D.S. Huang H.S.

The transportation of absorbed β-carotene by low density lipoproteins in the plasma compartment has been reported (8Krinsky N.I. Cornwell D.G. Oncley J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 73: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Traber M.G. Diamond S.R. Lane J.C. Brody R.I. Kayden H.J. Lipids. 1994; 29: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the isolation of a partially purified carotenoid-protein complex from rat liver (10Okoh C. Mychkovsky I. Lakshman M.R. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1993; 4: 569-575Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, the existence of a specific cellular carotenoid-binding protein (CCBP) 1The abbreviations used are: CCBP, cellular carotenoid-binding protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin; AS, ammonium sulfate; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)-ethane sulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: CCBP, cellular carotenoid-binding protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin; AS, ammonium sulfate; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)-ethane sulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. in mammalian system is a distinct possibility in analogy with the well characterized cellular retinoid-binding proteins (11Ong D.E.

Academic Press, New York1984: 90-119Google Scholar). The inability in characterizing such a protein complex from mammalian tissues so far may be due to difficulties in formulating a proper aqueous medium for the extraction of such a carotenoid-protein complex. In this paper we present, for the first time, the purification to homogeneity and partial characterization of a CCBP from the livers of β-carotene-fed male ferrets. The domestic ferret (Mustela putoris furo) was chosen for this study because it has many anatomical and physiological features that are similar to humans (13Fox J.G. Biology and Diseases of the Ferret. Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia1988Google Scholar). Furthermore, just like humans, ferrets are also known to absorb intact β-carotene from their diet and have the capacity to store absorbed β-carotene in tissues (14Ribaya-Mercado J.D. Holmgren S.C. Fox J.G. Russel R.M. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Ribaya-Mercado J.D. Fox J.G. Rosenblad W.D. Blanco M.C. Russel R.M. J. Nutr. 1992; 122: 1898-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16White W.S. Peck K.M. Ulman E.A. Erdman Jr., J.W. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 1129-1139PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, characterization of a CCBP in the ferret would have relevance to humans. Male ferrets (M. putoris furo) (body weight ∼600 g) were procured from Marshall Farms, North Rose, NY. After 1 week of quarantine, they were maintained on a high protein ferret diet (Purina, St. Louis, MO) for 1 week. This diet had 40% protein, 13% fat, and 22% carbohydrate. This diet was fortified with 2 g of β-carotene in the form of beadlets (Hoffman-La Roche, Nutley, NJ; β-carotene, 10% w/w, product code 65661) and 10 g of taurocholate/kg, and the animals were fed ad libitum for a period of 4 weeks. The animals were euthanized by aortic exsanguination under pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), and the livers were saved for CCBP isolation. All chemicals, solvents, and reagents were of analytical or ultrapure grade. The procedure was performed essentially according to that described by us previously for rat liver (10Okoh C. Mychkovsky I. Lakshman M.R. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1993; 4: 569-575Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, each liver was homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkman Instruments, Westbury, NY.) with 10 volumes of the homogenizing buffer (50 mm MES, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.2%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 5 mmCHAPS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml butylated hydroxytoluene, and 1 μg/ml each of the following protease inhibitors: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and leupeptin. Unless otherwise specified, all procedures were carried out under F40 Gold fluorescent light at 4 °C. Following ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g, the supernatant fraction was subjected to 0–50% ammonium sulfate (AS) fractionation. The AS fraction was redissolved in elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1 μg/ml each of the following: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and leupeptin). After dialysis against the elution buffer, this fraction was incubated with [14C]β-carotene (2 × 106 dpm) for 1 h at 25 °C. The dialyzed [14C]β-carotene-labeled AS fraction from the previous step was further fractionated on a DEAE-Sephacel column (1.5 cm × 25-cm bed; Sigma), equilibrated with elution buffer. The column was initially washed with two bed-volumes of the elution buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, and then with two bed-volumes of the same buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. Finally, the carotenoid-protein complex was eluted from the column as a yellow band with the elution buffer containing 350 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The eluted fractions were monitored for their absorption at 280 and 465 nm in a Shimadzu UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-160). Fractions 9–19 corresponding to the peak of14C radioactivity were pooled, concentrated by the use of a Speed-Vac Concentrator (Forma Scientific, Inc., Marrieta, OH), and stored at 4 °C for further studies. The concentrated fraction containing CCBP from the previous step was subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Sephadex G-75 column (1 cm × 25 cm) equilibrated with the elution buffer. The eluted fractions were monitored for their absorption at 280 and 465 nm. Fractions 20–25 corresponding to the major peak of 14C radioactivity were collected, concentrated by the use of a Speed-Vac concentrator, and stored at 4 °C for further studies. The yellow concentrated CCBP fraction obtained from the Sephadex-G75 column chromatography step was treated with an equal volume of cold acetone (−20 °C), shaken gently, and left aside at −20 °C for 20–30 min, followed by centrifuging at 1300 × g for 20 min. The organic supernatant fraction was removed, while the apoprotein pellet was dissolved in the original volume of TAB buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.2). The apoprotein was reprecipitated with an equal volume of cold acetone as before, and the pellet again was redissolved in the original volume of TAB buffer. Its protein content was estimated (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). Since CCBP showed high affinity for β-carotene, we decided to explore whether it was possible to make an affinity column with immobilized β-carotene as the affinity ligand. However, β-carotene is a long chain hydrocarbon with no functional groups, which makes its immobilization difficult, if not impossible. Therefore, we took a novel approach of using the Pharmalink immobilization kit (Pierce), which is based on the principles of the Mannich reaction to immobilize the ligand. The Mannich reaction consists of the condensation of formaldehyde or any other aldehyde with ammonia, primary or secondary amines, and a ligand molecule having possibly an active hydrogen. The Pharmalink gel included in the kit is immobilized diaminodipropylamine, which can be used as a source of the primary amine. The 5,6-ethylenic bond on the β-ionone ring, especially with the activator methyl group at C-5 position, can sufficiently activate the hydrogen atom at C-4 or C-4′ to participate in this reaction, as shown in Fig. 1. However, the ligand binding to the matrix can also occur at other positions since β-carotene has a number of conjugated double bonds with adjacent methyl groups to activate a hydrogen atom for participation in this reaction. All operations were carried out in the dark or, where necessary, under F40 gold fluorescent light to minimize the oxidation of β-carotene. The procedure described below was essentially according to manufacturer's specifications using their kit, which contained all the coupling reagents. Briefly, the storage solution in the Pharmalink column (2-ml prepacked column) was drained completely, and the gel was equilibrated with the coupling buffer (2 ml of buffer plus 2 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)). The coupling buffer was also drained as before. Purified β-carotene (10 mg) dissolved in 2 ml of Me2SO containing butylated hydroxytoluene (50 μg/ml) was then mixed with the Pharmalink gel, followed by the addition of Pharmalink coupling reagent in the reaction bottle initially at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 24 h with gentle mixing end over end. The column matrix was washed thoroughly with 30 ml of the TAB buffer containing 50% ethanol until no more unbound β-carotene was eluted from the column (evidenced by absorption spectrum). It was found that 90% of the added β-carotene was bound to the matrix. The ligand binding to the affinity matrix increased to 100% when only 0.2 mg of β-carotene was used for binding. The washed column with immobilized β-carotene was ready for affinity chromatography after equilibration with five volumes of TAB buffer. Fig. 1 shows the proposed structure of immobilized β-carotene using the Pharmalink gel, although other sites of attachment of the chromophore may be possible as indicated previously. CCBP apoprotein fraction, isolated by cold acetone treatment of the complex fraction from Sephadex-G75 column chromatography step (∼3 mg of protein), was subjected to affinity chromatography on the Pharmalink-immobilized β-carotene column prepared above. After applying the protein, the column was initially washed with 20 ml of the TAB buffer to remove the unbound protein (evidenced by the decrease in absorbance at 280 nm). The bound protein was then eluted from the affinity column with 20 ml of the TAB buffer containing 250 mm NaCl and collected as 1-ml fractions. Aliquots of fractions showing protein peaks were tested for their homogeneity by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). Fractions showing a single homogeneous band were pooled, concentrated in a Speed-Vac concentrator, dialyzed against TAB buffer, and stored at 4 °C. This purified protein was tested for its binding affinity to various carotenoid ligands as described below. The standard binding assay (unless specified otherwise) was as follows; 30 μg of purified CCBP or a nonspecific protein like bovine serum albumin (BSA) or the 43-kDa protein from ferret liver in 950 μl of TAB buffer was incubated with 8 nmol of β-carotene in 50 μl of acetone at 37 °C for 60 min. This was followed by thorough extraction of each reaction mixture with 8 ml of light petroleum five times to remove the unbound carotenoid. The absorption spectrum of each resulting aqueous reaction mixture was determined. In addition to β-carotene, the binding of the following ligands to CCBP was tested under standard binding conditions: α-carotene, cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, lycopene, astaxanthin, and retinol. The competitive binding assay was similar to the standard binding assay described above except for the following details. (i) [14C]β-Carotene (specific activity 168,000 dpm/nmol) was used instead of unlabeled β-carotene. (ii) The incubation with labeled β-carotene was carried out both in the absence and presence of 20-fold excess of the following unlabeled ligands: β-carotene, α-carotene, cryptoxanthin, astaxanthin, lycopene, and retinol. At the end of the incubation period, 100 μl of the reaction mixture was loaded on a Sephadex G-25 column matrix (Biospin disposable column with an Eppendorf collection tube: 0.65 × 3 cm, packed dimensions, Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with TAB buffer. The column was centrifuged at 1100 × g for 5 min, and the 14C radioactivity in the eluted fraction was determined using a Beckman LS-6500 liquid scintillation spectrometer, which showed a14C counting efficiency of 95%. This procedure resulted in the quantitative recovery of CCBP-bound [14C]β-carotene in the Eppendorf collection tube, whereas the unbound [14C]β-carotene was completely trapped on the column. Control experiments with (i) labeled β-carotene only and (ii) labeled β-carotene incubated with a nonspecific protein, BSA, showed negligible recovery of the label in the eluate. The method was identical to the competitive binding assay described above, except that the CCBP (62 nm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of [14C]β-carotene (62.5–3200 nm) both in the presence and absence of 20-fold excess of unlabeled β-carotene and the amount of [14C]β-carotene bound was determined after the spin column procedure. The specific binding (total minus nonspecific) was subjected to Scatchard analysis using the LIGAND computer program. All fractions were tested by 10% SDS-PAGE or 6% native PAGE essentially as described by Laemmli and Favre (18Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar), and stained with Silver Stain Plus (Bio-Rad) or Coomassie Blue stain. Purified apo-CCBP (50 μg) was labeled with 125I using Bolton and Hunter's reagent essentially as described (19Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). After extensive dialysis the specific activity of the 125I-apo-CCBP was 2 × 105 cpm/μg, of which 95% was trichloroacetic acid-precipitable (15% w/v). A 67-kDa protein has been purified to homogeneity from ferret liver, which showed a high degree of specificity to β-carotene. The purification steps involved ion exchange, gel filtration, and affinity chromatography, which are described below. The elution profile of labeled β-carotene complex during ion exchange chromatography of the crude AS fraction of the 100,000 × g fraction of ferret liver homogenate in a detergent-containing buffer is shown in Fig.2. The yellow fraction that was eluted with the elution buffer containing 0.35 m NaCl showed the characteristic β-carotene absorption spectrum (data not shown). It was also found that 78% of the 14C radioactivity applied to the column was associated with this protein complex. SDS-PAGE on 10% gel of this fraction is shown in Fig.3. It revealed the existence of four major bands and several minor bands when stained with Coomassie Blue. The peak fraction from DEAE-Sephacel column had an absorbance of 0.156 at 280 nm and 0.284 at 465 nm (A 465/A 280 ratio 1.82).Figure 3SDS-PAGE of the protein pool eluted from the DEAE-Sephacel column. An aliquot of the DEAE-Sephacel column purified complex was delipidated and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel according to the procedures described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following the run, the gel was stained using Coomassie Blue to visualize the protein bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The peak labeled β-carotene complex fraction isolated from the DEAE-Sephacel chromatography step was subjected to Sephadex-G75 gel filtration chromatography. Several early fractions were eluted exhibiting minor radioactive peaks, but none of them had β-carotene spectrum (data not shown). However, fractions 20–25 showed a major radioactive peak along with a characteristic β-carotene spectrum. Fractions 20–25 accounted for 74% of the 14C radioactivity applied to the column. The peak fractions 21 and 22 had 14C/protein ratios of 6 × 105 and 6.1 × 105 dpm/280 nm absorbance unit, respectively. The peak fraction had an absorbance of 0.24 at 280 nm and 0.46 at 465 nm (A 465/A 280 ratio 1.92). SDS-PAGE of this fraction showed a major band of 67 kDa and several minor bands of ≤50 kDa (data not shown). It was clear that the β-carotene-binding protein was still not homogeneous. A 43-kDa protein band was extracted with TAB buffer and saved for binding assay as a nonspecific ferret liver protein. To purify further, the apoprotein fraction was isolated from the pooled fractions 20–25 by removing the chromophore with cold acetone as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To rule out that it was not labeled β-carotene alone that was being eluted during the chromatography steps described above, the elution profile of radioactive β-carotene from both DEAE-Sephacel and Sephadex G-75 columns without any protein extracts was tested as follows. [14C]β-Carotene (1 μCi and 100 nmol) was prepared as a liposome with phosphatidylcholine (1000 nmol) according to cholate dialysis method (20Chen C.-H. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 680-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and chromatographed on each of the above columns. In contrast to the elution profile of the CCBP, all of the labeled β-carotene was eluted from these columns in the void volume of elution buffer (data not shown). The apoprotein fraction, isolated from the complex after Sephadex-G75 chromatography, when subjected to affinity chromatography on the Pharmalink-immobilized β-carotene column, yielded a fraction that was eluted with TAB buffer (no detergent) containing 250 mm NaCl. SDS-PAGE of an aliquot of this fraction on 10% gel showed a single homogeneous band with a molecular mass of 67 kDa (Fig. 4). Significantly, no detergent-containing buffer was used to elute the apoprotein from the affinity column. Thus the apoprotein is totally water-soluble. This affinity-purified protein fraction was used for all subsequent analyses. The elution profile of BSA, a nonspecific protein, was tested to demonstrate the specificity of this affinity column. It was found that BSA was completely eluted in the void volume when chromatographed on the affinity column under identical conditions. This experiment proves beyond doubt the specificity of the affinity column to a specific carotenoid-binding protein. Table Ishows the summary of purification of CCBP. It must be pointed out that because the crude liver homogenate failed to show any high affinity binding with labeled β-carotene the true -fold purification of the homogeneous CCBP should be much higher than that reported. Thus, taking the crude AS fraction to have a relative binding of 1 arbitrary unit, CCBP was purified 15-fold at DEAE-Sephacel chromatography step, 30-fold at Sephadex G75 chromatography step, and, finally, 607-fold after the affinity chromatography step. The final yield of the purified protein was approximately 500 μg from 5 g of liver.Table ISummary of purification of CCBPFractionProteinβ-Carotene boundSpecific bindingPurificationμgpmolpmol/μg protein-foldAS-Fraction350077.80.0221DEAE-Sephacel500166.80.3315Sephadex-G75245162.30.6630Affinity5066713.35607Binding assay was carried out with the indicated amounts of each fraction using 8 nmol of [14C]β-carotene (168,000 dpm/nmol) in the absence (total binding) and presence of 20-fold excess nonradioactive β-carotene (nonspecific binding) under standard conditions, and the amount specifically bound (total minus nonspecific binding) is expressed in picomoles of β-carotene. The -fold purification was calculated based on the specific binding of each fraction. Each value is the average of three independent determinations. Open table in a new tab Binding assay was carried out with the indicated amounts of each fraction using 8 nmol of [14C]β-carotene (168,000 dpm/nmol) in the absence (total binding) and presence of 20-fold excess nonradioactive β-carotene (nonspecific binding) under standard conditions, and the amount specifically bound (total minus nonspecific binding) is expressed in picomoles of β-carotene. The -fold purification was calculated based on the specific binding of each fraction. Each value is the average of three independent determinations. The purified protein showed a high affinity binding with β-carotene with its characteristic absorption spectrum (Fig. 5) consisting of a shoulder peak at 460 nm and two prominent peaks at 482 and 516 nm, apart from a protein peak at 280 nm. There was a 32-nm bathochromic shift of its λmax compared with that of β-carotene in light petroleum. The bound chromophore could be extracted from the CCBP complex with light petroleum only after it was treated with an equal volume of acetone. In contrast, the nonspecific proteins BSA and ferret liver 43-kDa protein showed low affinity binding to β-carotene as evidenced by the lack of the characteristic β-carotene absorption spectrum in the standard binding assay. This was because the weakly bound β-carotene was completely extracted with light petroleum even without denaturation with acetone. Fig.6 shows the Scatchard plot of the specific binding of β-carotene to CCBP as a function of increasing concentration of β-carotene. The nonspecific binding ranged from 7 to 13% of the total binding at the ligand concentrations tested. The analysis of the specific binding data by LIGAND program showed two classes of binding sites, with an apparent K d of 56 × 10−9m for the high affinity site and an apparent K d of 32 × 10−6m for the low affinity site. TheB max for β-carotene binding to the high affinity site was 1.16 mol/mol. It can be seen in Table I that when the binding assay was carried out on a large scale, 13.35 pmol of β-carotene were specifically bound/μg of purified CCBP. This amounts to 0.89 mol of β-carotene bound/mol of CCBP, a value comparable to that obtained from the Scatchard analysis. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that CCBP binds β-carotene mole per mole at the high affinity site. In contrast, the calculatedB max of 145 mol/mol by LIGAND program for the low affinity site may not have physiological relevance because of its very high K d of 32 μm. The purified125I-apo-CCBP was complexed with β-carotene under standard conditions, and both the holo- and apo-CCBP were subjected to native PAGE on a 6% polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. Fig. 7 shows that both holo-CCBP (lane 1) and apo-CCBP (lane 2) moved as homogeneous bands, although apo-CCBP moved faster than the holo-CCBP. Since the mobility of proteins in native PAGE is by their net charge, native PAGE is not a reliable method to assess the molecular size of any protein (21Nielsen T.B. Reynolds J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 48: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Significantly, 125I-apo-CCBP moved as a single sharp band with a molecular size of 67 kDa on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel (data not shown) and thus confirmed our finding of the mobility of unlabeled apo-CCBP (Fig. 4). Among the alternate ligands tested, only α-carotene and cryptoxanthin showed any binding as evidenced by their corresponding absorption spectra (data not shown). In contrast, β-ionone ring substituted carotenoids such as zeaxanthin or astaxanthin, a carotenoid without an intact β-ionone ring like lycopene, and a shortened molecule with one intact β-ionone ring like retinol showed no binding, as evidenced by the lack of their characteristic absorption spectra. Competitive binding of [14C]β-carotene by 20-fold excess of each alternative ligand was determined, and the results are shown in Table II. Each value is the average of triplicate experiments. It is obvious that, while α-carotene and cryptoxanthin inhibited labeled β-carotene binding by 94% and 84%, respectively, none of the other ligands tested showed any competition. Thus, CCBP showed a high degree of specificity toward carotenoids with at least one unsubstituted β-ionone ring but not toward other carotenoids, or retinol.Table IICompetition by various ligands for CCBP binding to [14C]β-caroteneLigandInhibition%β-Carotene100α-Carotene94Cryptoxanthin84Astaxanthin5Lycopene+13Retinol0[14C]β-Carotene binding to purified CCBP was determined in the absence and presence of 20-fold excess of the indicated ligands as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the results are expressed as % inhibition (or % activation marked by + sign) taking the inhibition by 20-fold excess of β-carotene to be 100%.

It is significant to point out that in contrast to a molecular size of 67 kDa for the mammalian CCBP found in this study, carotenoproteins from various lower organisms vary widely between 18 and 350 kDa in their sizes. Thus, α-crustacyanin, an astaxanthin-binding protein from carapace of the lobster, is a 350-kDa protein (22Keen J.N. Caceres I. Eliopoulos E.E. Zagalsky P.F. Findlay J.B.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas a lutein-binding protein isolated from the mid-gut of silkwormBombyx mori is a 36-kDa protein (23Jouni Z.E. Wells M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14722-14726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The plant and the bacterial carotenoproteins are 18- and 35-kDa proteins, respectively (24Zhou J.R. Gugger E.T. Erdman Jr., J.W. J. Agric. Food. Chem. 1994; 42: 2386-2390Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Bullerjahn G.S. Sherman L.A. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 396-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, mammalian retinoid-binding proteins are in the 15-kDa range (11Ong D.E. Crow J.A. Chytil F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13385-13389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chytil F. Ong D.E. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Academic Press, New York1984: 90-119Google Scholar). CCBP from the mammalian source in the present study exhibits three peaks at 460, 482, and 516 nm (Fig. 5) with a 32-nm bathochromic shift in its λmax compared with the absorption spectrum of β-carotene in light petroleum. Interestingly, carotenoid-binding proteins from Mangifera indica (26Subbarayan C. Cama H.R. Indian J. Biochem. 1966; 3: 225-227PubMed Google Scholar) and from cyanobacterium (25Bullerjahn G.S. Sherman L.A. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 396-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also had a similar absorption spectra with λmax at 498 and 476 nm, respectively. However, crustacyanin, the carotenoprotein from lobster carapace, showed a 160-nm bathochromic shift in its λmax compared with the absorption spectrum of the parent carotenoid, astaxanthin (27Zagalsky P.F. Eliopoulos E.E. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The physiological role/s of CCBP remains to be defined. In view of the possible protective roles of carotenoids against cancer, heart disease, and erythropoietic porphyria, a potential role for a specific binding protein may become central in the mechanism of action of carotenoids. Thus, CCBP may play a major role in the storage, transport, and targeting of β-carotene in mammalian systems. It may also act as the natural substrate for many of the metabolic reactions of β-carotene. By virtue of forming a stable high affinity complex, it may protect the carotenoid from degradation. As a result, carotenoids bound to CCBP may be better antioxidants compared with free carotenoids and thus protect the system from oxidative damage. In conclusion, a specific CCBP has been purified to homogeneity with a molecular mass of 67 kDa from a mammalian liver. It exhibits high affinity binding to β-carotene in the molar ratio of 1:1, with an apparent dissociation constant of 56 × 10−9m. The complex exhibits the characteristic carotenoid absorption with the λmax at 482 nm. Alternate ligands, with one intact β-ionone ring like α-carotene and cryptoxanthin, compete with β-carotene binding by 94% and 84%, respectively. However, CCBP does not bind astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, lycopene, or retinol. We gratefully acknowledge the generous gift of β-carotene beadlets and [14C]β-carotene from Hemmige N.

In this study, we have developed two peptide antagonists of human angiogenin by deducing the codes from the antisense RNA sequence corresponding to the receptor-binding site of angiogenin in either 5′ → 3′ (chANG) or 3′ → 5′ (chGNA) direction. chANG and chGNA peptides bind to angiogenin with specificity and high affinity (K d ≈ 44 nm) and inhibit the interaction of angiogenin with actin, which is regarded as the angiogenin-binding protein on the surface of endothelial cells. The peptides inhibit the neovascularization induced by angiogenin in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. The anti-angiogenic activity of the peptides is specific for angiogenin, and the peptides do not have any apparent effect on embryonic angiogenesis or the preexisting blood vessels. chANG and chGNA also inhibit the angiogenesis induced by the angiogenin-secreting PC 3 human prostate adenocarcinoma cells and have no direct effect on the proliferation as well as the adhesion of PC 3 cells to angiogenin. Therefore, the inhibition of the tumor-induced angiogenesis by the peptides is most likely caused by neutralization of the extracellular angiogenin secreted by PC 3 cells. Based on our results, chANG and chGNA peptides may be effective for treatment of various human tumors which secrete angiogenin. Angiogenesis promotes growth and metastasis of tumor cells.

However, several lines of evidence suggest that the biological action of angiogenin is mediated through a cell surface receptor (5Bicknell R. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to its ribonucleolytic activity, the receptor-binding site of angiogenin (residues 58–70) is essential for its angiogenic activity (11Hallahan T.W. Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl.

This appears to be the reason for RNase not being angiogenic despite its high ribonucleolytic activity. Recently, it was reported that a hybrid RNase protein in which the receptor-binding site of angiogenin (residues 58–70) replaced the corresponding residues of RNase (residues 59–73) promotes angiogenesis as effectively as angiogenin (14Raines R.T.

Consequently, the receptor-binding site of angiogenin is a good target site for development of angiogenin antagonists.According to the hydropathic complementarity of amino acids, the amino acid deduced by an antisense code (either 5′ → 3′ or 3′ → 5′ direction) is generally antipathic, that is, a hydrophobic amino acid can be deduced from a code for a hydrophilic amino acid, vice versa (15Blalock J.E. Smith E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 121: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The peptides, which are designed by the hydropathic complementary approach, show inverse hydropathic relationship to the peptides encoded by sense mRNA, and the designed peptide binds target protein with specificity and high affinity (16Bost K.L.

There are several examples that demonstrate successful application of this approach. Antagonists of various proteins such as ACTH, ribonuclease S peptide, c-Raf protein, fibronectin, insulin, and α-chain of fibrinogen were developed based on this approach (16Bost K.L. Smith E.M.

Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) in either 5′ → 3′ direction (chANG) or 3′ → 5′ direction (chGNA) effectively inhibit the interaction of angiogenin with its putative receptor actin in vitro. Furthermore, these peptides block the neovascularization induced by angiogenin and angiogenin-secreting tumor cells in the chick CAM assay. These angiogenin antagonists may be useful for the treatment of human angiogenin-dependent tumors.DISCUSSIONSince neovascularization is indispensable for tumor growth and metastasis (28Folkman J. Cotran R.S. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1976; 16: 207-248PubMed Google Scholar, 29Folkman J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 4-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4375) Google Scholar), development of inhibitors that block the formation of new blood vessels can be an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment of both primary and metastatic cancer. Among the tumor-associated angiogenic factors (30Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar), angiogenin may be the most important angiogenic factor, because angiogenin has been known as one of the most potent angiogenic factors secreted by tumor cells (1Fett J.W. Strydom D.J. Lobb R.R. Alderman E.M. Bethune J.L. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5480-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) and has an essential role for the establishment of different histological types of human tumor cells (31Olson K.A. Fett J.W. French T.C. Key M.E. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32Olson K.A. French T.C. Vallee B.L. Fett J.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4576-4579PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, development of angiogenin antagonists that can block the angiogenic activity of this protein is worthwhile.Our goal in this work was development of the peptide antagonists of angiogenin using hydropathic complementary approach (15Blalock J.E. Smith E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 121: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 16Bost K.L. Smith E.M. Blalock J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1372-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). chANG and chGNA peptides, which are antipathic to the receptor-binding site of angiogenin, interact directly with angiogenin with somewhat high affinity (K d ≈ 44 nm) and also show anti-angiogenin activities without any effect on the ribonucleolytic activity of angiogenin. Both peptides inhibit the interaction of angiogenin with the angiogenin-binding protein, actin, in a concentration-dependent manner and block the neovascularization induced by angiogenin in the chick CAM assay. The anti-angiogenic activity of these peptides is specific for angiogenin, because the presence of these peptides does not have any effect on embryonic angiogenesis or the preexisting blood vessels. Both peptides inhibit the angiogenin-induced neovascularization more effectively than actin, which is previously shown to be an angiogenin antagonist (10Hu G.F. Strydom D.J. Fett J.W. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1217-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chANG and chGNA inhibit the neovascularization induced by the angiogenin-secreting PC 3 tumor cells without any effect on the preexisting blood vessels. However, the peptides do not affect the adhesion of PC 3 cells to angiogenin and proliferation of PC 3 cells. Therefore, the inhibition of the tumor-induced angiogenesis by these peptides is not caused by cytotoxicity toward tumor cells, but is most likely caused by neutralization of the extracellular angiogenin secreted by PC 3 cells. Our results also provide additional evidence that the interaction of angiogenin with its putative receptor actin via the receptor-binding site of angiogenin (residues 58–70) is essential for angiogenic activity of angiogenin (11Hallahan T.W. Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).The results presented in this report clearly demonstrate that small peptides such as chANG (11 amino acid) and chGNA (13 amino acid) bind to the receptor-binding site of angiogenin, and the binding of these peptides to angiogenin inhibits the interaction of angiogenin with actin. The interaction of these peptides with angiogenin is not sequence- or conformation-directed, but rather dependent on the hydropathic profile of these peptides for the following reason. Although both chANG and chGNA peptides have similar affinity for angiogenin and similar anti-angiogenin activities, the primary amino acid sequence of the chANG peptide is completely different from that of chGNA. However, the hydropathic profiles of both peptides are almost the same. According to the previous reports, the interactions between hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids is feasible and may provide the driving force for the binding of complementary peptides to target protein (17Shai Y. Flashner M. Chaiken I.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Fassina G. Roller P.P. Olson A.D. Thorgeirsson S.S. Omichinski J.G. J. Biol.

A. 1988; 85: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structure of the cocrystals of angiogenin and these peptides will provide direct information on how these peptides interact with angiogenin.Actin and noncytotoxic monoclonal antibodies against human angiogenin have been shown to prevent or delay the establishment of the angiogenin-secreting human tumor cell lines such as HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma, HT-1080 fibrosarcoma, and A 549 lung carcinoma in nude mice (31Olson K.A.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4576-4579PubMed Google Scholar). The antitumor activity of the antibodies and actin is caused by neutralization of the extracellular angiogenin secreted by the tumor cells. chANG and chGNA peptide antagonists of angiogenin may inhibit the growth and metastasis of the angiogenin-secreting human cancer as effectively as the angiogenin antibodies and actin in animal studies and may be directly used for treatment of some types of human cancer. Angiogenin is the tumor-derived potent angiogenic factor (1Fett J.W. Strydom D.J. Lobb R.R. Alderman E.M. Bethune J.L. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L.

In this report, we show that the two peptides deduced from the antisense RNA corresponding to the receptor-binding site of human angiogenin (residues 58–70; Ref. 11Hallahan T.W. Shapiro R.

Furthermore, these peptides block the neovascularization induced by angiogenin and angiogenin-secreting tumor cells in the chick CAM assay. These angiogenin antagonists may be useful for the treatment of human angiogenin-dependent tumors. DISCUSSIONSince neovascularization is indispensable for tumor growth and metastasis (28Folkman J.

Among the tumor-associated angiogenic factors (30Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar), angiogenin may be the most important angiogenic factor, because angiogenin has been known as one of the most potent angiogenic factors secreted by tumor cells (1Fett J.W. Strydom D.J. Lobb R.R. Alderman E.M. Bethune J.L. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5480-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) and has an essential role for the establishment of different histological types of human tumor cells (31Olson K.A.

Therefore, development of angiogenin antagonists that can block the angiogenic activity of this protein is worthwhile.Our goal in this work was development of the peptide antagonists of angiogenin using hydropathic complementary approach (15Blalock J.E. Smith E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 121: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 16Bost K.L. Smith E.M. Blalock J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1372-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). chANG and chGNA peptides, which are antipathic to the receptor-binding site of angiogenin, interact directly with angiogenin with somewhat high affinity (K d ≈ 44 nm) and also show anti-angiogenin activities without any effect on the ribonucleolytic activity of angiogenin. Both peptides inhibit the interaction of angiogenin with the angiogenin-binding protein, actin, in a concentration-dependent manner and block the neovascularization induced by angiogenin in the chick CAM assay. The anti-angiogenic activity of these peptides is specific for angiogenin, because the presence of these peptides does not have any effect on embryonic angiogenesis or the preexisting blood vessels. Both peptides inhibit the angiogenin-induced neovascularization more effectively than actin, which is previously shown to be an angiogenin antagonist (10Hu G.F. Strydom D.J. Fett J.W. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1217-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chANG and chGNA inhibit the neovascularization induced by the angiogenin-secreting PC 3 tumor cells without any effect on the preexisting blood vessels. However, the peptides do not affect the adhesion of PC 3 cells to angiogenin and proliferation of PC 3 cells. Therefore, the inhibition of the tumor-induced angiogenesis by these peptides is not caused by cytotoxicity toward tumor cells, but is most likely caused by neutralization of the extracellular angiogenin secreted by PC 3 cells. Our results also provide additional evidence that the interaction of angiogenin with its putative receptor actin via the receptor-binding site of angiogenin (residues 58–70) is essential for angiogenic activity of angiogenin (11Hallahan T.W. Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).The results presented in this report clearly demonstrate that small peptides such as chANG (11 amino acid) and chGNA (13 amino acid) bind to the receptor-binding site of angiogenin, and the binding of these peptides to angiogenin inhibits the interaction of angiogenin with actin. The interaction of these peptides with angiogenin is not sequence- or conformation-directed, but rather dependent on the hydropathic profile of these peptides for the following reason. Although both chANG and chGNA peptides have similar affinity for angiogenin and similar anti-angiogenin activities, the primary amino acid sequence of the chANG peptide is completely different from that of chGNA. However, the hydropathic profiles of both peptides are almost the same. According to the previous reports, the interactions between hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids is feasible and may provide the driving force for the binding of complementary peptides to target protein (17Shai Y.

Three-dimensional structure of the cocrystals of angiogenin and these peptides will provide direct information on how these peptides interact with angiogenin.Actin and noncytotoxic monoclonal antibodies against human angiogenin have been shown to prevent or delay the establishment of the angiogenin-secreting human tumor cell lines such as HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma, HT-1080 fibrosarcoma, and A 549 lung carcinoma in nude mice (31Olson K.A.

Effector proteins have been identified by their ability to bind to Ras in the GTP but not GDP form, and by their requirement for the Ras effector domain for binding. The best understood Ras effectors are serine/threonine kinases of the Raf family, but other candidate Ras effectors, including a Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) have also been identified. To investigate the mechanism of binding of cRaf-1 to Ras, and to investigate the roles of other candidate Ras effectors in transformation, we have isolated and characterized mutants of activated Ras with decreased binding to cRaf-1 relative to other candidate effectors. Examination of these mutants indicates that surface-exposed residues of Ras outside the minimal effector domain interact differentially with cRaf-1 and other Ras-binding proteins, and that fibroblast transformation correlates with cRaf-1 binding and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. Furthermore, activation of PI3 kinase can occur in the absence of significant MAP kinase activation, suggesting that PI3 kinase activation is a primary effect of Ras.

Furthermore, activation of PI3 kinase can occur in the absence of significant MAP kinase activation, suggesting that PI3 kinase activation is a primary effect of Ras. The Ras proteins Ha-Ras, K-rasA, K-rasB and N-Ras are membrane-associated proteins that cycle between GDP and GTP-occupied states. Mutations in Ras that increase the amount of bound GTP activate the protein and are oncogenic, causing morphological and mitogenic transformation. The features of the Ras molecule that are needed for Ras transformation have been revealed by studying mutations that reduce the oncogenicity of activated Ras (1Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Such loss of function mutations include those that inhibit GTP binding, promote GTP release, or prevent membrane localization. In addition, many substitutions of residues 32–38 inactivate Ras without reducing GTP binding or membrane localization. Therefore this region is postulated to be needed for Ras to transmit a signal to cell proteins that induce malignant transformation. These proteins are known as Ras effectors and the region of Ras that they contact is the effector domain. Because a nononcogenic relative of Ras, Rap1A, contains an identical effector domain, Ras residues separate from the effector domain must also needed for binding or activation of Ras effectors (2Noda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 97-109PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of chimeras between Ha-Ras and Rap1A suggests that these additional residues flank the effector domain in the Ras sequence (residues 21–45) (3Zhang K. Noda M. Vass W.C. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R. Science. 1990; 249: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The solution of a three-dimensional structure of Ras has shown that the effector domain between residues 32 and 40 (Switch I) changes conformation between the GDP and GTP states, together with residues 60–72 (Switch II) (see Wittinghofer and Nassar (4Wittinghofer A. Nassar N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 488-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)). The GTP-induced rearrangement of the backbone and side chains of Switch I is consistent with this portion of the molecule directly contacting effectors dependent on GTP. A growing number of cell proteins have the biochemical properties expected of Ras effectors, binding to Ras dependent on GTP and the effector domain, but it seems unlikely that all are important for Ras signaling (1Marshall M.S.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5466-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Of these putative effectors, Raf and PI3 kinase have been shown to have effector functions. Genetic analyses in Drosophilaand Caenorhabditis show that Raf is required for Ras to induce specific cellular differentiation events in those organisms. In mammalian systems, artificial activation of Raf causes the same effects as activated Ras independently of Ras, suggesting that Raf activation is sufficient for some Ras responses. In addition, expression of full-length kinase-defective Raf or fragments containing the Raf Ras-binding domain (RBD) block many Ras responses. Unfortunately, such experiments are difficult to interpret because such “dominant-negative” mutants are in competition with all Ras effectors. One additional effector likely to be regulated by Ras in the cell is PI3 kinase. Downward and co-workers have shown that the stimulation of PI3 kinase activity by Ras does not require Raf and is likely due to direct association of Ras with PI3 kinase (14Rodriguez-Viciana P.

To investigate the role of cRaf-1 relative to other candidate Ras effectors, we have identified mutations in activated Ha-Ras that decrease interaction with cRaf-1 while retaining interaction with RalGDS and a PI3 kinase. The locations of the mutations outside the minimal effector domain suggests that effectors make specific contacts with other parts of Ras. The properties of the mutants suggest that Raf activation is essential for Ras to transform NIH3T3 cells. Two-hybrid analysis using LexA-Ras and VP16-RBDs and dual lacz andHIS3 reporters has been described before (17Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Because Ras-Raf interactions gave low and variable signals in solution β-galactosidase assays (17Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), interaction strength was determined by filter assays for β-galactosidase, using 0.75 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside and incubations from 4 h to overnight at 30 °C. Activation of theHIS3 reporter was assessed by plating serial dilutions of cultures onto plates containing different concentrations of 3-aminotriazole and calculating plating efficiency. Negative and positive controls were included in every assay. Ras Switch I mutants were the kind gift of J. Stone, University of Alberta (18Stone J.C. Blanchard R.A. Mol. Cell.

The human cHa-Ras G12V mutant open reading frame was mutagenized by polymerase chain reaction amplification using Taq polymerase in the presence of MnCl2 (20Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar) and ligated into BTM116. DNA was electroporated into Escherichia coli and approximately 45,000 transformants pooled for DNA extraction. The library DNA was transformed into L40 strain yeast containing VP16-cRaf1, and 2,500 transformants plated out at approximately 250 colonies per plate. Filter assays were performed to identify colonies that were not expressing β-galactosidase. Five hundred candidates were identified from 2,500 transformants, and these were retested and confirmed to be negative for expression of lacz and HIS3. These cells, which are MAT a ade2, were patched in four replicates onto rich agar plates. Each replicate was mated with yeast strain JC1, which is MAT a ade8 (17Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), containing either VP16, VP16-cRaf1, VP16-RalGDS, or VP16-p110δRBD. After overnight incubation, the patches were replica plated onto plates lacking adenine, to enrich for diploids. After an additional day of growth, filter assays were performed to identify cultures that were expressing β-galactosidase conditional upon RalGDS or p110δ. Sixteen candidates were identified and the mutant BTM116-Ras plasmid was successfully isolated from seven of them. These plasmids were retested by transformation into L40 strain yeast containing either VP16, VP16-cRaf1, VP16-RalGDS, or VP16-p110δRBD. Four mutant BTM116-Ras plasmids (J1, J10, J25, and J31) retested positive in both β-galactosidase and HIS3 assays with VP16-RalGDS and VP16-p110δRBD and negative with VP16 and VP16-cRaf1. Mutants were sequenced on both strands using dye terminator sequencing. J1A was derived from J1 using the NcoI site at codon 110, and J31A was derived similarly from J31. J25A and J25B were derived from J25 making use of the BsmBI site at codon 47. Ras G12V and mutants were moved into vector pGEX-2T (21Smith D.B. Johnson K.S.

Binding assays were performed as described elsewhere (17Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). GST-Ras fusion proteins were incubated with GTP or GDP in the presence of EDTA, Mg2+ was added, and the solutions were added to amylose resin carrying maltose binding protein fused to codons 51–210 of cRaf-1. After 1 h at 4 °C, the resin was washed, and bound proteins were eluted with maltose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting with antibodies to GST. Equal recovery of maltose binding protein fusions was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining. The binding reactions contained approximately 700 nm cRaf-1 RBD and 330 nm GST-Ras. Activated Ras mutants were transferred from the BTM116 vector to mammalian expression vectors CS2 (22Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) and DOJ (23Korman A.J. Frantz D.J. Strominger R.L. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Equal transfection of DOJ constructs was confirmed by selection for the drug selection marker present on the DOJ vector. For production of NIH3T3 and Swiss 3T3 cell lines, retroviral stocks were prepared from the DOJ vector constructs (26Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar, 27Afar D.E. Goga A. McLaughlin J. Witte O.N. Sawyers C.L. Science. 1994; 264: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). 60-mm plates of 293T cells were transfected with 5 μg of DOJ construct and 10 μg of ecotropic retroviral packaging vector (26Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar). The media were changed the next morning, and the virus collected 60 h later. The virus stock was supplemented with 8% polybrene, and 50% confluent NIH3T3 cells or Swiss 3T3 cells were infected for 3 h. Cells resistant to G418 were selected, and protein expression was determined by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody specific for Ha-Ras (LA-069, Quality Biotech). NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with the DOJ vector or with DOJ vector containing the Ras mutants were plated at 3 × 104/well into 24-well plates. The cells were fed every 3rd day. Each day, cell number was determined. Cell density was maximal on the 6th day. Ras-expressing Swiss 3T3 cells were plated onto glass coverslips that had been washed with ethanol, coated with type III collagen (W. Carter, FHCRC; 64 μg/ml, 30 min), and blocked with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml, 20 min). Following 2 h for cell attachment, coverslips were washed twice with Dulbecco' modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% serum and incubated overnight in the same medium. The cells were stained with bodipy phalloidin (Molecular Probes) essentially as recommended by the manufacturer. The coverslips were washed three times with warmed PBS and treated with the following solutions at room temperature: (i) 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS, 10 min; (ii) PBS (two washes); (iii) 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS; (iv) PBS (three washes); (v) 5% calf serum in PBS, 1 h; (vi) bodipy phalloidin (1.5 units/200 μl) and 5% calf serum in PBS, 40 min; (vii) PBS (two washes); (viii) water (two washes). Coverslips were mounted in Vectamount (Vector Laboratories). To examine the rate of cell spreading, 105 cells were plated as above on collagen-coated coverslips and allowed to attach for 10 min. Unattached cells were then removed by washing with medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and at various times the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked as above. Coverslips were then incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine (antibody 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, 1:200 dilution) for 2 h. The cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated in 5% calf serum in PBS for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, 1:500) for 2 h, washed 3 times in PBS 0.1% Triton X-100, 3 times in PBS, and stained with phalloidin as described above. To examine the phosphorylation state of MAP kinases, lysates of Swiss 3T3 cells were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. The gel was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with an rabbit anti MAP kinase antibody (antiserum 1913) (28Posada J. Sanghera J. Pelech S. Aebersold R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For transient assays, Myc epitope-tagged Xenopus MAP kinase (28Posada J. Sanghera J. Pelech S. Aebersold R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) in the CS2 vector was transfected along with Ras mutants (also in the CS2 vector) into 293T cells (26Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar) by the BBS/CaCl2 precipitation method. The media were changed the next day and incubated for a further 24 h. Fifty hours after transfection the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% serum, and 72 h after transfection the cells were washed in PBS and lysed in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% 2 mercaptoethanol, 5 mmNaF, 0.02 mm NaVO4, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin). Following brief sonication, the lysates were clarified at 20,000 × g. Forty μl of the clarified lysate were reserved for SDS-PAGE analysis, and the remainder was immunoprecipitated with 9E10 anti-Myc epitope antibody (29Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) for 30 min. Fixed Staphylococcus aureus, coated with goat anti-mouse antibodies, was added for a further 2 h, and immunecomplexes were collected by centrifugation. Immuneprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and suspended in 150 μl of 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4 and split into aliquots for Western blot and for immune complex kinase assays. For immune complex assays, immuneprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in 30 μl of a kinase mix (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgSO4, 15 mm MnCl2, 15 μm ATP, 0.02 mmNa3VO4, 0.17 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP/ml, 0.17 mg of myelin basic protein/ml). The reactions were mixed and immediately placed at 30 °C. After 10 min the reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal amount of 2 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE for Western blot and by 15% SDS-PAGE for kinase assays. Levels of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdInsP3) were determined as described previously (15Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5-cm plates of 293 cells were transfected with 5 μg of pSG5–110α DNA and 1 μg Ras G12V or mutant DNA in the CS2 vector and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then labeled overnight in low phosphate medium (15Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) containing 0.5 mCi of 32Pi. Phospholipids were extracted and analyzed by thin layer chromatography with nonradioactive phosphoinositides as markers. The markers were calibrated in a separate experiment against authentic PtdInsP3 made by the reaction of p110α with PtdIns(4,5)P2 and [γ-32P]ATP. Increased levels of PtdInsP3were observed in cells overexpressing both p110α and activated Ras G12V, but not in cells overexpressing either alone, as observed before (15Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Structure 6Q21 (c-Ha-Ras p21 protein catalytic domain complexed with βγ-methylene-GTP) was retrieved from the Brookhaven Protein Data base, and selected residues were colored using Quanta. Fragments of candidate Ha-Ras effectors were identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse embryo cDNA library (17Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A.

Clones that interacted with wild-type or G12V (activated mutant) but not with T35L/E37R (effector domain double mutant) or G15A (dominant-negative mutant) forms of human Ha-Ras were sequenced and found to contain fragments of five different proteins: cRaf-1 (17Vojtek A.B.

Rap1a interacts with Rip51, containing the Raf RBD, the RBD of RalGDS, and with full-length RalGDS. In striking contrast with Ha-Ras, Rap1a does not interact with full-length cRaf-1, full-length A-Raf or its RBD, full-length B-Raf, or the RBD of p110δ (data not shown). These results indicate that residues outside the core effector domain are required for interaction of Ha-Ras with cRaf1, A-Raf, B-Raf, and the PI3 kinase RBD, but that residues within the core effector domain may be sufficient for Ha-Ras and Rap1a to interact with RalGDS, the RalGDS RBD, and the Raf RBD. To identify features in Switch I needed for binding each candidate effector, seven effector domain mutants of Ras were chosen (TableII). Five are point mutants that are nontransforming in rodent fibroblasts (18Stone J.C. Blanchard R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6158-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and one (P34R) is transforming but fails to interact with RasGAP (19Stone J.C. Colleton M. Bottorff D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7311-7320Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The seventh mutant is a nontransforming double mutant (31Willumsen B.M. Papageorge A.G. Kung H.-F. Bekesi E. Robins T. Johnson M. Vass W.C. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These mutants were tested for interaction with the RBDs of cRaf-1, p110δ, RalGDS, or RGL, as well as with full-length cRaf-1 and RalGDS (Table II). All Ras mutants interacted with CDC25, a Ras exchange factor, indicating that they were all expressed.Table IIInteractions between effector domain mutants, candidate Ras effectors, and CDC25MutantcRaf-1RalGDSRalGDS RBDp110 RBDRGL RBDRaf RBDCDC25G12V2-aHa-Ras activated by a G12V mutation and carrying a wild-type effector domain.

Open table in a new tab Mutant D38A was unable to interact with any fragment or full-length effector tested (Table II). Mutants Y32F and P34G did not interact detectably with full-length cRaf-1 or RalGDS, or with the RBDs of RalGDS, p110δ, or RGL, but they did interact with the Raf RBD. Mutant P34S interacted detectably with the RalGDS RBD and more strongly with the Raf RBD. Mutant E37A did not interact with full-length cRaf-1, but interacted weakly with RalGDS and strongly with the RBDs of RalGDS, p110δ, RGL, and Raf. Mutant P34R, which alone of the effector domain mutants tested has transforming activity in mammalian cells (19Stone J.C. Colleton M. Bottorff D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7311-7320Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), interacted with all effectors tested. Most of the effector domain mutants can be ranked in a hierarchy (Table II). The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the effector mutants tested reduce interactions with all effectors proportionately, and that effectors differ in their strength of interaction with the wild-type effector domain, full-length cRaf-1 being weakest and the Raf RBD most robust. Mutations that clearly discriminate between effectors were not evident in this small sampling of effector domain mutants. To identify mutations that might affect the specificity of interaction of Ras and discriminate between effectors, we screened a collection of random mutants of activated (G12V) Ha-Ras. The library was first screened for mutations that reduced interaction with cRaf-1. Approximately 20% of the mutagenized population had greatly decreased interaction with cRaf-1. These mutants were picked and tested individually for interaction with the p110δ RBD and RalGDS. One percent of the Ras mutants that did not interact with cRaf-1 retained the ability to interact with either RalGDS or the p110δ RBD, or both. Four mutant DNAs were isolated and retested by transformation into yeast together with various effector protein plasmids (TableIII). All four mutants interact with RalGDS, the p110δ RBD and the Raf RBD, but not detectably with cRaf-1. Sequencing of the isolates showed that mutant J10 contains a single residue substitution, E31K. Mutants J1, J25, and J31 all contain more than one substitution"
https://openalex.org/W2078491598,"Modulation of β-adrenoreceptor expression by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was investigated in murine 3T3-F442A adipocytes. TNF-α treatment of mature adipocytes decreased β3-adrenoreceptor mRNA content in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, with a 8.5-fold decrease observed after a 6-h exposure to 300 pm TNF-α. β1-Adrenoreceptor mRNA abundance was slightly decreased by TNF-α treatment, while β2-adrenoreceptor mRNA levels were potently induced (6-fold increase at 6 h). (−)-[125I]Iodocyanopindolol saturation and competition binding experiments indicated that TNF-α induced a 2-fold decrease in β3-adrenoreceptor number, a nonsignificant reduction in β1-subtype population, and a ∼4.5-fold increase in β2-adrenoreceptor density. This correlated with a lower EC50 value measured for epinephrine in stimulating adenylyl cyclase, whereas the EC50 value for norepinephrine increased. Nuclear run-on assays on isolated nuclei and mRNA stability measurements showed that TNF-α increased both β2-adrenoreceptor gene transcription and β2-adrenoreceptor mRNA half-life, while β1- and β3-adrenoreceptor gene expression was modulated only at the transcriptional level by the cytokine. These findings demonstrate a differential modulation by TNF-α of the three β-adrenoreceptor subtypes in adipocytes, which may contribute to metabolic disorders induced by the cytokine in the adipocyte.

Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 625-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar). Subsequent investigations have shown that TNF-α was fundamentally involved in control of the growth, differentiation, and metabolism in several normal cells and tissues. A sum of work has been focused on the role of TNF-α in the regulation of adipocyte development and metabolism (1Beutler B. Cerami A. Annu. Rev.

Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2581-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). So far, the molecular mechanism by which the cytokine potentiates lipolysis remains unclear (17Green A. Dobias S.B. Walters D.J.A. Brasier A.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2581-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Through activation of three β-AR subtypes, catecholamines exert a key role in the regulation of lipid metabolism in adipocytes. They modulate cAMP-dependent processes such as lipolysis and the genetic control of the lipogenic and thermogenic pathways. As regards the pleiotropic effects of TNF-α on several metabolic pathways in adipocytes, and to the key role of the β-AR system in lipid mobilization, it is possible that an interplay between TNF-α and β-ARs contributes to the biological effects of the cytokine. The present study was initiated to investigate the regulation by TNF-α of the three β-AR subtypes. Using the model of the 3T3-F442A cell line that presents a coordinate expression of the three β-AR subtypes in the mature adipose phenotype (18Fève B. Emorine L.J. Lasnier F. Blin N. Baude B.

Pharmacol. 1996; 297: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that TNF-α differentially regulates β1-, β2-, and β3-AR gene expression and responsiveness. 3T3-F442A cells (20Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) were grown and differentiated as described (18Fève B. Emorine L.J. Lasnier F. Blin N. Baude B. Nahmias C. Strosberg A.D. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20329-20336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At day 8 after confluence, more than 90% of the cells had the morphology of mature adipocytes. After two washes, cells were kept for 24 h in defined medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (2:1, v/v) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Thereafter, the cells were maintained either in the absence or in the presence of TNF-α. Total RNA was extracted from 3T3-F442A adipocytes by the method of Cathala et al. (21Cathala C. Savouret J.F. Mendez B. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA. 1983; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis RNA samples were electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel, and transferred to nylon Nytran-plus membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). After RNA fixation, prehybridization was carried out at 65 °C for 30 min in the presence of 0.5 m sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm EDTA (22Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7249) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed in the same buffer in the presence of the heat-denatured probe (2–3 × 106 cpm/ml). Membranes were washed twice for 30 min at 65 °C in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC: 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS, and then once in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 65 °C. Probes were labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP (ICN Radiochemicals). The β1- and β2-AR probes have been described elsewhere (23J. Biol. Chem. 269, 6664–6670Krief, S., Fève, B., Baude, B., Zilberfarb, V., Strosberg, A. D., Pairault, J., and Emorine, L. J. J. Biol. Chem. , 269, 6664–6670Google Scholar). The β3-AR probe is a 305-bp amplification product of the cloned murine β3-AR gene (24Nahmias C. Blin N. Elalouf J.M. Mattei M.G. Strosberg A.D. Emorine L.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3721-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). β-Actin probe (pAct-1) (25Spiegelman B.M. Frank M. Green H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10083-10089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was generously given by Dr. Howard Green (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). For RT-PCR analysis of β-AR subtype expression, total RNA was digested for 15 min at 37 °C with 0.1 unit of RNase-free DNase I (RQ1 DNase, Promega)/μg of nucleic acid in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2 in the presence of 1 unit/μl ribonuclease inhibitor (RNAguard, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, RNA (0.25–1 μg) was reverse-transcribed with MMLV-RT (200 units/μg) (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 10 μm random hexanucleotides (Pharmacia), 1 unit/μg ribonuclease inhibitor, 400 μm of each dNTP in a final volume of 20 μl consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. After a 1-h incubation at 42 °C, MMLV-RT was heat-inactivated. To ensure that subsequent amplification did not derive from contaminant genomic DNA, a control without MMLV-RT was included for each RNA sample. cDNA were denatured for 5 min at 95 °C and submitted to 20–25 cycles of amplification (1 cycle: 94 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min) followed by a final extension of 5 min at 72 °C in a DNA thermal cycler 9600 (Perkin Elmer). PCR was performed in a 25-μl reaction containing 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 125 μm each dNTP, 5% formamide, 125 nm both sense and antisense oligonucleotides. The buffer consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, and 2 mmMgCl2. Sequences of the sense and antisense oligonucleotides were: 5′-GGATCCAAGCTTTCGTGTGCACCGTGTGGGCC-3′ and 5′-GGATCCAAGCTTAGGAAACGGCGCTCGCAGCTGTCG-3′ for the β1-AR; 5′-GCCTGCTGACCAAGAATAAGGCC-3′ and 5′-CCCATCCTGCTCCACCT-3′ for the β2-AR; 5′-ATGGCTCCGTGGCCTCAC-3′ and 5′-CCCAACGGCCAGTGGCCAGTCAGCG-3′ for the β3-AR; 5′-GAGACCTTCAACACCCC-3′ and 5′-GTGGTGGTGAAGCTGTAGCC-3′ for β-actin. These oligonucleotides were derived from the sequences of the corresponding genes and cDNAs (24Nahmias C. Blin N. Elalouf J.M. Mattei M.G. Strosberg A.D. Emorine L.J.

Amplification products had expected sizes of 286, 329, 308, and 236 bp for β1-, β2- and β3-ARs and β-actin, respectively. They were separated on a 2% agarose gel and then visualized by ethidium bromide staining or transferred to nylon Nytran-plus membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Prehybridization and hybridization with specific β1-, β2-, and β3-AR and β-actin [α-32P]dCTP random-primed DNA probes were carried out in a sodium phosphate buffer (22Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7249) Google Scholar). Final washes were performed in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 65 °C. Preliminary experiments were carried out with various amounts of cDNA to determine nonsaturating conditions of PCR amplification for β1-, β2-, and β3-AR and β-actin. Thus, cDNA amplification was performed in comparative and semiquantitative conditions. For quantitation, gels or autoradiograms were analyzed by videodensitometric scanning (Vilber Lourmat Imaging), and β-AR signals were normalized to those of β-actin. For transcription analysis, preparation of the nuclei, elongation assay, DNase I, and proteinase K treatments were performed as described previously (29Antras J. Lasnier F. Pairault J. J. Biol.

Membranes were washed twice in 2 × SSC for 30 min at 60 °C and treated for 30 min at 37 °C in the same buffer containing RNase A at 5 μg/ml.

Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Adenylyl cyclase activity (EC 4.6.1.1) was measured as described (18Fève B. Emorine L.J. Lasnier F. Blin N. Baude B. Nahmias C. Strosberg A.D. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20329-20336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was carried out for 10 min at 35 °C and was initiated by the addition of crude membranes to a standard buffer containing 0.1 mm [α-32P]ATP (1 μCi) (ICN), 1 mm cAMP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 0.5 unit of creatine phosphokinase, 100 μm GTP (Boehringer Mannheim) (except when GTPγS, NaF, or forskolin were used), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), with or without a β-adrenergic effector. G3PDH activity was measured in the cytosolic fraction as described (33Pairault J. Lasnier F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 132: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For [125I]CYP binding experiments, cells were harvested and homogenized at 4 °C in 1 mm EDTA, 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5). Homogenates were centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C at 100,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in the homogenization buffer and stored at −80 °C until it was used. Membrane aliquots (40 μg of protein) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with [125I]CYP with or without competing ligand in a final volume of 250 μl consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmascorbic acid, and 100 μm GTP. After dilution with 3 ml of ice-cold 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), separation of bound from free radioligand was achieved by vacuum filtration over Whatman GF/C filter paper, followed by three washes with the same buffer. Saturation experiments were performed with [125I]CYP concentrations ranging from 5 to 4000 pm. Competition experiments were carried out at 30 pm [125I]CYP. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm CGP12177 and was usually ∼20% of total binding at 30 pm[125I]CYP. Data from saturation and competition experiments were analyzed with the EBDA and LIGAND programs (Biosoft-Elsevier, Cambridge, United Kingdom (UK)). Lipolysis was assessed as glycerol release from adherent cells in 24-well plates. Adipocyte monolayers were washed with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), supplemented with 2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 50 μg/ml Na2S2O5 as antioxidant. Cells were then incubated with or without β-adrenergic effectors for 2 h at 37 °C. Aliquots of the incubation medium (300 μl) were removed to determine glycerol (34Lin E.C.C. Magasanik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1820-1823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of NAD to NADH was recorded at 340 nm in the presence of glycerol dehydrogenase (EC1.1.1.6) from Enterobacter aerogenes (Boehringer Mannheim). Reaction buffer consisted of 130 mm(NH4)2SO4, 10 μmMnCl2, 3.3 mm NAD, and 125 mmK2CO3/NaHCO3 (pH 10). [125I]CYP was obtained from Amersham and [α-32P]ATP from ICN Radiochemicals. CGP12177 and CGP20712A were generous gifts from Ciba-Geigy (Basel, Switzerland). ICI118551 was provided by Imperial Chemical Industries (Macclesfield, UK), BRL37344 by Smith Kline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (Epsom, UK). ISO, (−)-norepinephrine, (−)-epinephrine, GTPγS, NaF and forskolin were Sigma products. Murine recombinant TNF-α was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Results are presented as means ± S.E. The level of significance between groups was assessed using either paired or unpaired Student's t test. Since the β3-AR is the main β-AR subtype expressed in rodent adipocytes (18Fève B. Emorine L.J. Lasnier F. Blin N. Baude B. Nahmias C. Strosberg A.D. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20329-20336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19El Hadri K. Fève B. Pairault J.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 518-527PubMed Google Scholar), we first evaluated the effect of TNF-α on β3-AR gene expression. 3T3-F442A mature adipocytes were exposed or not to various TNF-α concentrations for 6 h, and total RNA was extracted. Then β3-AR mRNA levels were studied both by Northern blotting and RT-PCR analyses. These two approaches converged to demonstrate that TNF-α down-regulated β3-AR mRNA levels (Fig.1). Repression of the three β3-AR mRNA species (2.3, 2.8, and 4.4 kilobases) was detectable at a cytokine concentration of 10 pm and was maximal at 100 pm, the half-maximal effect being between 10 and 30 pm. The time dependence of β3-AR mRNA down-regulation was also studied in 3T3-F442A adipocytes untreated or treated for 1–48 h with 1 nm TNF-α. Accumulation of β-actin mRNA remained relatively constant over the time course of the treatment. Conversely, β3-AR mRNA levels decreased as early as 2 h (Fig. 2) after the onset of TNF-α treatment, with a maximal repression occurring by 6 h (8.5 ± 1.6-fold decrease, p < 0.001). Modulation of β-AR mRNA levels by TNF-α was not limited to the β3-AR subtype. Exposure of 3T3-F442A adipocytes to increasing concentrations of TNF-α for 6 h slightly decreased β1-AR mRNA abundance (Fig.3, B and C). This effect was detectable only at a concentration of 100 pm and was maximal at 1 nm. By contrast, TNF-α potently induced β2-AR mRNA levels (Fig. 3, A–C). This increase was significant at 3 pm TNF-α and was maximal at 300 pm, giving a half-maximal action between 3 and 10 pm. TNF-α-induced repression of β1-AR transcripts was observed after a 1-h exposure to 1 nmcytokine and was maximal at 6 h (∼1.6-fold decrease,p < 0.01) (data not shown). Induction of β2-AR mRNA content by TNF-α was very rapid. As compared with control levels, the increase in β2-AR mRNA abundance was observed as early as 1 h in the presence of 1 nm TNF-α. This effect was maximal at 6 h (6-fold increase, p < 0.005) and then became less pronounced (4-fold induction at 48 h). Saturation and competition binding experiments were carried out on membrane fractions to determine the levels of β-AR subtype density after treatment of 3T3-F442A adipocytes for 24 h with 1 nmTNF-α. In agreement with the results derived from Northern blotting and RT-PCR analyses, TNF-α down-regulated the β3-AR (Table I). The density of β3-ARs, corresponding to the Bmax of the low affinity sites for [125I] CYP (18Fève B. Emorine L.J. Lasnier F. Blin N. Baude B. Nahmias C. Strosberg A.D. Pairault J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20329-20336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was reduced by 2-fold after TNF-α exposure (n = 4, p < 0.001). By contrast, the number of the high affinity binding sites that represents the sum of β1- and β2-ARs was moderately induced in the presence of TNF-α (1.8-fold increase,n = 4, p < 0.05). No significant difference in the K D values of the two binding classes for the radioligand could be detected between control and TNF-α-treated cells.Table ICharacterization of [125I]CYP binding sites in membranes from control and TNF-α-treated 3T3-F442A adipocytesCulture condition[125I]CYP binding sitesHigh affinity (β1- and β2-ARs)Low affinity (β3-AR)K DB maxK DB maxpmfmol/mgpmfmol/mgControl26.4 ± 3.44.7 ± 1.0 (2.1%)2930 ± 490215.4 ± 20.1 (97.9%)TNF-α29.7 ± 4.88.4 ± 1.7 (7.3%)*2520 ± 500106.7 ± 16.8 (92.7%)**Membranes from control and TNF-α-treated (1 nm for 24 h) 3T3-F442A adipocytes were tested in [125I]CYP saturation binding experiments using a wide range of concentrations (5–4000 pm) of the radioligand.

[125I]CYP competition binding experiments against β-AR subtype-selective ligands were also performed to determine the relative proportions of β1- and β2-ARs. These competition studies were carried out at a low (30 pm) [125I]CYP concentration. As regards the low affinity of the β3-AR for [125I]CYP, this concentration of radioligand did not allow a significant occupancy of the β3-AR by [125I]CYP. This was confirmed by the competition of [125I]CYP at 30 pm with increasing concentrations of the β3-AR-selective agonist BRL37344. Analysis of [125I]CYP displacement curve by BRL37344 indicated the absence of any detectable high affinity β3-AR component (data not shown). Under these conditions, competition of [125I]CYP with β1- or β2-AR subtype-selective antagonists allowed to estimate the relative proportions of each β-AR subtype, with no significant interference of the β3-AR population. In agreement with molecular results, analysis of the displacement curves of [125I]CYP by the β1-AR-selective antagonist CGP20712A or by the β2-AR-selective antagonist ICI118551 demonstrated that TNF-α caused a 3.3–5.6-fold induction in β2-AR density (n = 5, p< 0.002) (Table II). TNF-α only induced a weak and nonsignificant reduction in the β1-AR population.Table IICompetition of [125I]CYP against β-AR subtype-selective ligands in membranes from control and TNF-α-exposed cellsLigandSelectivityBinding affinity (related β-AR subtype)Culture conditionsControlTNF-αK iB maxK iB maxnmfmol/mgnmfmol/mgCGP20712Aβ1High (β1-AR)4.1 ± 1.33.0 ± 0.5 (64%)4.9 ± 1.62.75 ± 0.85 (33%)Low (β2-AR)2000 ± 5501.7 ± 0.5 (36%)3300 ± 7805.65 ± 0.85 (67%)*ICI118551β2High (β2-AR)3.4 ± 1.80.95 ± 0.30 (20%)3.1 ± 0.45.35 ± 0.35 (64%)*Low (β1-AR)627 ± 1423.75 ± 0.30 (80%)750 ± 1823.05 ± 0.35 (36%)Membranes were prepared from control and TNF-α-treated (1 nm for 24 h) 3T3-F442A adipocytes.

https://openalex.org/W1971374538,"Inhibition of human chymase by the serpins alpha1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (PI) at pH 8.0 produces a complex stable to dissociation by SDS/dithiothreitol and a second product, hydrolyzed/inactivated serpin. The first product is the presumed trapped acyl-enzyme complex typical of serpin inhibition, and the second is the result of a concurrent substrate-like reaction. As a result of the hydrolytic reaction, stoichiometries of inhibition (SI) appear greater than 1; values of 4 and 6.0 are observed for the chymase-ACT and -PI reactions. In this study the effect of pH on the inhibition rate constant (kinh) and the SI of each reaction were evaluated to better define the rate-limiting steps of the inhibitory and hydrolytic reaction pathways associated with chymase inhibition. Reactions were evaluated over a pH range to correlate kinh and SI with the ionizations (pK values of 7 and 9) that typically regulate serine protease catalytic activity. The results show that the effects of pH on SI and kinh differ for each inhibitor. On reducing the pH from 8.0 to 5.5, the chymase-ACT reaction exhibited a decrease in SI (to about 1) and little change in kinh, whereas the chymase-PI reaction revealed an increase in SI and a marked decrease in kinh. On increasing the pH from 8.0 to 10.0, the chymase-ACT reaction exhibited little change in SI and a marked decrease in kinh, whereas the chymase-PI reaction revealed a decrease in SI and a marked increase in kinh. Chymase catalytic properties determined for a peptide substrate were atypical over the high pH range exhibiting increases for kcat/Km and kcat and decreases for Km. This behavior suggests the presence of a high pH enzyme form with enhanced hydrolytic activity. From these results and others involving analyses of ACT/PI reactive loop chimeras and ACT point variants exhibiting a range of SI values, we suggest that the diverse pH effects on kinh and SI are caused largely by a difference in the abilities of ACT and PI to interact with low (catalytically inactive) and high (catalytically enhanced) pH forms of chymase. The constancy of kinh for the chymase-ACT reaction over the low pH range suggests that the rate-limiting step for inhibition is pH insensitive and not reflective of diminished chymase hydrolytic activity. Low pH did not appear to affect the rate of SDS-stable complex formation as complex accumulation, assessed qualitatively by SDS-PAGE, correlated with the loss of chymase enzymatic activity."

This promoter is located 5′ to the transcriptional start site of a short open reading frame BNLF-2A and is immediately 3′ to the BNLF-1 (LMP-1 oncogene) open reading frame. We studied transcriptional regulation of the ED-L2 promoter by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) as a means of understanding the tissue specificity of this promoter. The transcriptional activity of the ED-L2 promoter was stimulated 40-fold by PMA and could be blocked with the compound H7 through antagonism of protein kinase C. 5′ deletion analysis of the 782-base pair promoter demonstrated that the sequences necessary for PMA-stimulated trans-activation were located in two separate cis-regulatory regions of the promoter: −187 to −164 and −144 to −114 base pairs from the transcription start site of BNLF-2A. Importantly, mutation of critical base pairs in each region was sufficient to abolish PMA-stimulatedtrans-activation in the native ED-L2 promoter. Region −187 to −164 contains a CACCTG (E-box) motif, and region −144 to −114 contains a CACACCC motif. Both of these motifs are necessary fortrans-activation by PMA. These regions do not, however, demonstrate enhancer characteristics when tested in a heterologous minimal promoter system. Variations of the CACACCC motif are found in other keratinocyte-specific promoters, as well as in the DNA binding motifs of the Krüppel-like family of transcription factors. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with specific competitors and factor-specific antibody supershift assays demonstrated that one complex binding the −187 to −164 region containing the CACCTG nucleotides has characteristics of the helix-loop-helix protein upstream stimulatory factor, whereas a factor binding the CACACCC motif may be a member of the Krüppel-like family. These experiments show how ubiquitous and tissue-specific transcription factors induced by PMA regulate the ED-L2 promoter in squamous epithelial cells.

One of the EBV-encoded gene products, latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1), has been shown to have oncogenic properties mediated through induction of cellular proliferation, inhibition of terminal differentiation, and inhibition of apoptosis (5Baichwal V.R.

It is likely that other EBV genes and gene products are important, if not necessary, in transformation of epithelial cells. The EBV ED-L2 promoter (also referred to as the EDL2 promoter, BNLF-2 promoter, BNLF-2A promoter, and BNLF-2 5′-regulatory sequence) is an early lytic cycle promoter and is defined as containing the TATA-box found in an EcoRI-BamHI fragment of the EBV genome, 30 base pairs 5′ to a putative transcription start site for two short open reading frames (13Baer R. Bankier A.T. Biggin M.D. Farrell P. Gibson T.J. Hatfull G. Hudson G.S. Satchwell S.C. Seguin C. Tuffnell P.S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1984; 310: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar, 14Farrell P.J. Bankier A. Seguin C. Deininger P. Barrell B.G. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1331-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These reading frames are designated BNLF-2A and -2B and encode 60 and 100 amino acids, respectively. The non-coding sequence containing the TATA element, designated the ED-L2 promoter, is located 3′ to another open reading frame (BNLF-1) that encodes LMP-1. When a fragment of the EBV genome containing coding and flanking sequences for BNLF-1 and 2 was expressed under control of the BNLF-1 and ED-L2 promoters, 0.6-kilobase transcripts were expressed in tissues possessing a stratified squamous epithelium (tongue and esophagus), whereas the BNLF-1 transcript was expressed ubiquitously (15Wilson J.B. Weinberg W. Johnson R. Yupsa S. Levine A.J. Cell. 1990; 61: 1315-1327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). As a means of understanding oncogenesis in the stratified squamous epithelium of the aero-upper digestive tract, we previously generated transgenic mice utilizing the ED-L2 promoter (16Nakagawa H. Wang T.C. Zukerberg L. Odze R. Togawa K. May G.W.H. Wilson J. Rustgi A.K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The transgene consisted of 782 base pairs of the ED-L2 promoter fused to the cyclin D1 oncogene. Mice harboring the transgene had high level cyclin D1 expression in the tongue, esophagus, and forestomach. Transgene expression was localized specifically to the basal and suprabasal layers of the stratified squamous epithelia. These in vivoobservations compelled us to postulate that the ED-L2 promoter is uniquely active in stratified squamous epithelial cells through cell type-specific interactions between cis-acting regulatory elements in the promoter and cellular trans-acting nuclear factors. In this context, we previously identified a CACCC-box likecis-regulatory element in the ED-L2 promoter between nucleotides −218 and −187 that interacts with several nuclear transcription factors, one of which is keratinocyte-specific (17Nakagawa H. Inomoto T. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16688-16699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This factor has been designated as keratinocyte-specific factor and likely transcriptionally regulates other viral and eukaryotic promoters active in keratinocytes. We further hypothesized that extracellular factors that govern the regulation of the ED-L2 promoter might be similar to those that govern other differentiation-critical promoters in keratinocytes. The most extensively studied keratinocyte system is the skin, and a key regulatory agent is phorbol ester. It has profound effects on the regulation of gene expression in keratinocytes, including expression of c-fos (18Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B.

Biol. 1986; 6: 1760-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Phorbol ester mediates these effects through the protein kinase C (PKC) family, phospholipid-dependent enzymes which initiate a cascade of phosphorylation events resulting in many varied biological responses (24Blumberg P. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1981; 9: 199-234Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Phorbol ester markedly changes keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation. Evidence supports the necessity of PKC activation for keratinocyte differentiation (25Stanwell C. Denning M.F. Rutberg S.E. Cheng C. Yuspa S.H. Dlugosz A.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 482-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Stanwell C. Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1259-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Ca2+-induced expression of genes for late differentiation markers such as transglutaminase, loricrin, and profilaggrin is dependent upon PKC activation; conversely, Ca2+-induced expression of the early markers keratins 1 and 10 is suppressed by PKC activation (27Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Williams E.K. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 149-157PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of PKC in keratinocyte differentiation is substantiated by the fact that PKC activators such as phorbol ester and synthetic diacylglycerols inhibit keratins 1 and 10 expression in vitro and in vivo (28Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar, 29Snoek G.T. Boonstra J. Ponec M. de Laat S.W. Exp. Cell. Res. 1987; 172: 146-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Study of the mechanisms by which phorbol ester produces its effects in keratinocytes has identified the transcription factor AP1 as central to its role (30Rutberg S.E. Saez E. Glick A. Dlugosz A. Spiegelman B.M. Yuspa S.H. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 167-176PubMed Google Scholar). AP1 consensus binding motifs are found in the keratin promoters and are important determinants of the keratinocyte state of differentiation (31Casatorres J. Navarro J.M. Blessing M. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20489-20496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in the involucrin promoter, which is expressed specifically in the suprabasal layer, two of five AP1 sites in the 2500-base pair promoter are critical for tissue specificity (32Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The effects are in turn mediated by transcription factors Fra-1, JunB, and JunD (32Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Another critical keratinocyte differentiation gene, collagenase, has a phorbol ester-inducible enhancer in its promoter sequence (33Chamberlain S.H. Hemmer R.M. Brinckerhoff C.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 52: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 34Shoshan M.C. Linder S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We postulated that phorbol ester regulates ED-L2 promoter activity for several reasons. First, because this promoter is specifically active in cells of keratinocyte origin, its regulation may be similar to the regulation of other keratinocyte genes, especially those involved in differentiation. Second, because the ED-L2 promoter shares motifs in common with other keratinocyte promoters under the influence of phorbol ester, it may also be governed by the same regulatory mechanisms. Third, a 0.6-kilobase transcript likely corresponding to BNLF-2A is induced in EBV-infected B lymphocytes upon phorbol ester treatment and was associated with latently infected lymphocytes entering the lytic cycle (14Farrell P.J. Bankier A. Seguin C. Deininger P. Barrell B.G. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1331-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Finally, because both the LMP-1 and ED-L2 promoters are early lytic promoters and in close physical proximity in the EBV genome, and since LMP-1 impairs differentiation, it is possible that the ED-L2 promoter may play a role in differentiation as well. In this study, we demonstrate that phorbol ester activates the ED-L2 promoter. A series of deletion construct experiments have led to the identification of two cis-regulatory elements in the ED-L2 promoter responsible for phorbol ester-induced transcriptional activity. These elements contain an E-box motif and a CACACCC motif, the latter recently shown to be important for binding of the Krüppel-like family of transcription factors, one of which is specifically expressed in epithelial cells of the squamous aero-upper digestive tract (35Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 36Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31384-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Electromobility shift assays demonstrate that specific factors, induced by treatment with PMA, bind these sequences. These experiments demonstrate how transcription factors regulated by phorbol ester through the protein kinase C pathway modulate an EBV promoter which is uniquely active in human stratified squamous epithelial cells. A 782-base pair sequence between nucleotide positions 168,268 and 167,487 of the B95-8 Epstein-Barr virus genome contains the ED-L2 promoter (13Baer R. Bankier A.T. Biggin M.D. Farrell P. Gibson T.J.

The 782-base pair fragment was isolated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described previously (17Nakagawa H. Inomoto T. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16688-16699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PCR amplification conditions consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min for 20 cycles. Identity of the ED-L2 PCR product was verified by DNA sequencing with the dideoxy-mediated chain termination method using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). After PCR amplification and confirmatory DNA sequencing, the reaction product was digested with BamHI andXhoI, agarose gel-purified, and ligated into the luciferase reporter gene promoterless vector, pXP2 (37Nordeen S.K. Biol. Tech. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar), to generate the ED-L2-782 plasmid containing 782 bp of the ED-L2 promoter. A subsequent series of ED-L2 promoter 5′ deletion constructs (ED-L2-610, ED-L2-287, ED-L2-218, ED-L2-187, ED-L2-164, ED-L2-144, and ED-L2-114) was made in a similar fashion using ED-L2-782 as a template for PCR with sense primers designed at the different positions of the promoter and an antisense primer from +24 of the coding region of the luciferase reporter gene, as described previously (17Nakagawa H. Inomoto T. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16688-16699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The ED-L2-435 plasmid was generated by digestion of ED-L2-782 with BamHI and SmaI, deleting 347 bp of the promoter sequence, followed by ligation. Minimal promoter DNA constructs containing wild-type or mutant nucleotides spanning promoter regions −188 to −159 and −144 to −115 of the ED-L2 promoter were generated by ligation of kinased double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides (A35 and H35 from Table I) into the BamHI site of the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter vector, pT81, with the luciferase reporter gene. Mutant promoter deletion constructs of regions −144 to 0 and −187 to 0 were made as follows. The ED-L2-782 plasmid was digested with BamHI and NheI restriction enzymes (unique NheI site at position −114 of ED-L2 promoter), followed by subsequent directional ligation with a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the remaining promoter sequence. Mutations within the full-length sequence positionally correspond to block mutations shown in Table I for AMT1 and AMT2 and HMT1 and HMT2. All plasmid DNA constructions were checked initially by restriction digestion for correct length and then verified by DNA sequencing by the dideoxy-mediated chain termination method using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Plasmids were purified by a modified alkaline lysis method (Primm Labs).Table ISense sequences of double-stranded oligonucleotides of the EBV ED-L2 promoter used for EMSAsProbeSequencePositionA5′-GAACACCTGTTG-3′(−184 to −173)AMT5′-GAAACGAGCTTG-3′(−184 to −173)A355′-GCAGGAACACCTGTTGTTGACACATTCTTT-3′(−188 to −159)AMT15′-GCAGTCTACGAGCGAGTTGACACATTCTTT-3′(−188 to −159)AMT25′-GCAGGAACACCTGTTTGACCATGCGACTTT-3′(−188 to −159)H 5′-TCTCACACCCAGA-3′(−135 to −123)HMT 5′-TCTACGTAGAAGA-3′(−135 to −123)H355′-TAATCCCTCTCTCACACCCAGAAACTAAGA-3′(−144 to −115)HMT15′-GCTAAGAGGTCTCACACCCAGAAACTAAGA-3′(−144 to −115)HMT25′-TAATCCCTCGAAACGTAGATGAAACTAAGA-3′(−144 to −115)Nucleotide positions in the EBV ED-L2 promoter are indicated in parentheses after each of the sequences.

The human esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line TE-11, pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1 (ATCC Rockville, MD), cervical cancer cell line HeLa (ATCC), and lung cancer cell line LX-1 (ATCC) were cultured under standard conditions as follows: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (BioWhittaker), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). A human B cell line, BJAB, was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) with 10% serum and antibiotics. Human skin (SCC-13) and tongue (SCC-25) squamous cell carcinoma cell lines were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), supplemented with 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 10% serum, and antibiotics. Transient transfection of the plasmid and minimal DNA constructions in cultured cells was carried out using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.). For transient transfections, TE-11 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells per 35-mm well and transfected 24 h later with 2 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid and 2 μg of pXGH5, a plasmid containing the mouse metallothionein-I promoter fused to the human growth hormone gene (Nichols Institute). The transfectant mixture consisted of a 250-μl solution of 125 mmCaCl2, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.05, 0.75 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, and 6 mm glucose. After a 12-h incubation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.1% serum containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added. In addition, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), forskolin (Sigma), 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperizine (H7) (Biomol), dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (db-cAMP) (Sigma), cyclosporin A (Sigma), or 10% serum were added at appropriate concentrations 12 h after transfections, and incubations were continued for a prescribed period. Luciferase assays were performed using luciferin, ATP, and coenzyme A (Promega), with a Monolight Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Cells were harvested 36 h post-transfection, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 200 μl of 1 × cell culture lysis reagent (Promega), and 40 μl of the lysate was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent consisting of 20 mm Tricine, 1.07 mm MgCO3, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol, 270 μm coenzyme A, 530 μm ATP, and 470 μm luciferin. Incubations were performed in triplicate, and results were calculated as the mean ± S.E. values for luciferase activity. Values were then expressed as fold increase or decrease compared with the control for each set of experiments. Activities were expressed as the mean of at least three independent transfection experiments. Expression of human growth hormone from the plasmid vector pXGH5, containing the human growth hormone gene under the control of the metallothionein-I promoter, was used as an internal control for a subset of the transfections to ensure consistency of transfection conditions. Empty pXP2, RSV luciferase, and the pT81 luciferase construct (37Nordeen S.K. Biol. Tech. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar), in which the luciferase gene is driven by the enhancerless herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter, served as additional controls. Nuclear extracts from the different cell lines were prepared as described previously, except the buffers were supplemented with a mixture of 0.5 μg/ml protease inhibitors aprotinin, chymostatin, and pepstatin (Boehringer Mannheim). The protein concentration was determined by a calorimetric method (Bio-Rad protein assay). α-32P-Labeled oligonucleotide DNA probes were constructed as follows. 5 pmol of a double-stranded oligonucleotide (shown in TableI), synthesized by the phosphoramidite procedure (Applied Biosystems) and purified by gel electrophoresis, was radiolabeled by the Klenow fill-in reaction in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mmdithiothreitol, 33 μm dATP, 33 μm dGTP, 33 μm dTTP, 0.33 μm[α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products), 1 unit of DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (Amersham Corp.), and then polyacrylamide gel-purified. EMSAs were carried out by incubating 5 μg of nuclear extract with 5 fmol of the α-32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNA probe (20,000 cpm) in a 20-μl binding reaction containing 10 mmTris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1.0 μg of poly(dA-dT) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the samples were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide, 0.25 × Tris borate gel and electrophoresed at 10 V/cm for 2 h. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-AR) at −80 °C. For competition experiments, the nuclear extract was preincubated with 100-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (Table I) prior to the addition of the α-32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNA probe. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by the phosphoramidite procedure (Applied Biosystems) and purified by gel electrophoresis. Immune supershift assays were performed using a polyclonal anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz) and a monoclonal anti-AP2 antibody (gift of T. Williams), a monoclonal anti-USF antibody, and a polyclonal anti-Egr antibody (gift of V. Sukhatme). The antibody was preincubated with the nuclear extract at room temperature for 15 min prior to the addition of the α-32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNA probe. Other conditions for the EMSAs are as described above. The A, AMT, H, and HMT single-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to wild-type and mutant sequences of the ED-L2 promoter (Table I) were labeled by annealing corresponding 7-mers followed by the Klenow fill-in reaction as described above, except that 5-bromodeoxyuridine was substituted for dTTP. Binding reactions were performed identically to the EMSA reactions (38Chin M.T. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that the reaction was for 30 min at 4 °C to inhibit protein degradation. Samples were then exposed to a medium wave (312 nm) UV transilluminator (UVP, Inc.) for 30 min on ice at a distance of 3 cm. Samples were then mixed with 2 × sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresis was carried out on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were then dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-AR) at −80 °C. To study the effect of different extracellular agents on ED-L2 promoter transcriptional activity, a luciferase reporter construct containing 782 base pairs of the ED-L2 promoter was used in a series of transient transfections of a cell line previously shown to exhibit high levels of promoter transcriptional activity, TE-11 (17Nakagawa H. Inomoto T. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16688-16699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Additionally, we previously demonstrated that the ED-L2 promoter is active in a number of different cell lines of keratinocyte lineage, in the presence of medium with 10% serum (17Nakagawa H. Inomoto T. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16688-16699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). TE-11 cells were transiently transfected with 2.0 μg of ED-L2-782 reporter gene construct followed by administration of PMA in varying concentrations in 0.1% serum for 24 h. A dose-response analysis showed that transcriptional activation induced by PMA could be initially detected at 10−9m, whereas maximal stimulation of the promoter occurred at 10−7m (Fig.1 A). Stimulation decreased at higher concentrations, from a 40-fold maximal increase in promoter activity at 10−7m to a 10-fold increase at 10−4m. To demonstrate the transfectability of TE-11 cells, the RSV promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct was found to yield an 8-fold increase in luciferase activity. Time course studies of the maximally effective dose of PMA demonstrated that an effect was first detectable at 2 h (6-fold stimulation) with maximal stimulation occurring at 12–24 h (Fig. 1 B). All subsequent transfection experiments examining the effects of PMA were carried out with PMA treatment for 24 h at 10−7m. No PMA stimulation was observed with a heterologous enhancerless herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter-luciferase reporter gene (pT81-luciferase) or a promoterless luciferase reporter gene, pXP2 (data not shown). To examine further the relationship of the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway and ED-L2 promoter activity in TE-11 cells, down-regulation of PKC was achieved through prolonged treatment with PMA. In addition, antagonism of PKC was accomplished with the PKC inhibitor H7, a serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitor that inhibits all isoforms of protein kinase C. Transiently transfected cells were stimulated with the maximally effective PMA concentration (10−7m) with or without H7 pretreatment for 1 h, as well as PMA (10−7m) treatment for 24 h in the absence of H7. H7 pretreatment decreased the PMA response by 70% (Fig.1 C). Prolonged PMA pretreatment for 24 h followed b"

Whereas cholesteryl ester transfer rates were gradually enhanced by the addition of moderate amounts of HDL from the different sources, striking differences appeared when HDL levels kept increasing beyond a maximal transfer value. Indeed, while a plateau value corresponding to maximal CETP activity was maintained when raising the concentration of HuAITg HDL and HuAIAIITg HDL, inhibitions could be observed with the highest levels of human, control mouse, and HuAIITg mouse HDL. The concentration-dependent inhibition of CETP activity could be reproduced by the addition of delipidated HDL apolipoproteins from control mice, but it was abolished by a 1-h preheating treatment at 56 °C. In contrast, no significant inhibition of CETP activity was observed with the delipidated protein moiety of HuAITg HDL, and cholesteryl ester transfer rates remained unchanged before and after a 1-h, 56 °C preheating step. Finally, the CETP-mediated transfer of radiolabeled cholesteryl esters from human low density lipoprotein to human HDL was significantly higher in the presence of lipoprotein-deficient plasma from HuAITg mice than in the presence of lipoprotein-deficient plasma from control mice. Interestingly, cholesteryl ester transfer rates measured with both control and HuAITg lipoprotein-deficient plasmas became remarkably similar following a 1-h, 56 °C preheating treatment.It is concluded that human, control mouse, and HuAIITg mouse HDL contain a heat-labile lipid transfer inhibitory activity that is absent from HDL of HuAITg and HuAIAIITg mice.

J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1255-1274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, CETP activity results in the net mass transfer of cholesteryl esters from the antiatherogenic high density lipoproteins (HDLs) toward the proatherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins, i.e. very low density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins (LDLs) (1Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1255-1274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of action of human CETP has now been clearly established, and it involves two main steps. In a first step, positively charged amino acids of CETP can interact with negative charges of lipoprotein particles from which, in a second step, it picks up or deposits neutral lipid molecules (for a review, see Ref.2Lagrost L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 209-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The CETP-lipoprotein binding has been shown to constitute one major determinant of the CETP-mediated neutral lipid transfer reaction (3Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12593-12599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and both insufficient and excessive binding of CETP to lipoproteins resulting from alterations in the electrostatic charge at the lipoprotein surface were shown to decrease the cholesteryl ester transfer rate (4Nishida H.I. Arai H. Nishida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16352-16360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Masson D. Athias A. Lagrost L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1579-1590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that two distinct positively charged amino acid residues, i.e.Lys233 and Arg259, are essential for the binding of CETP to lipoproteins, and consistent observations were made by using point mutagenesis (6Jiang X-C. Bruce C. Cocke T. Wang S. Boguski M. Tall A.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7258-7263Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and specific monoclonal antibodies (7Roy P. Mac Kenzie R. Hirama T. Jiang X-C. Kussie P. Tall A. Rassart E. Milne R. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, whereas the lipoprotein binding domain of CETP has now been characterized, the lipoprotein components involved in the interaction with CETP remain to be clearly identified. During the last 15 years, both lipids and apolipoproteins were described as putative modulators of CETP activity (2Lagrost L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 209-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In particular, in vitro studies showed that the replacement of apoA-I by apoA-II in plasma HDL can modulate the rate at which cholesteryl esters are transferred between HDL and LDL (8Lagrost L. Perségol L. Lallemant C. Gambert P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3189-3197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the latter phenomenon was associated with apolipoprotein-mediated changes in the electrostatic charge of HDL (5Masson D. Athias A. Lagrost L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1579-1590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy however that the effect of apolipoproteins remains controversial, and HDL apolipoproteins have been alternatively described as neutral (9Moulin P. Cheung M.C. Bruce C. Zhong S.

In fact, several studies reported the presence of a specific lipid transfer inhibitor protein (LTIP) in plasmas and lipoproteins from several species, including rats (15Tollefson J.H. Liu A. Albers J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: E902-E984Google Scholar), baboons (16Kushwaha R.S. Hasan S.Q. McGill Jr., H.C. Getz G.S. Dunham R.G. Kanda P. J.

Although it has been recently proposed that baboon LTIP could consist in the association of one molecule of apoA-I with one 38-amino acid-long, N-terminal fragment of apoC-I, LTIP has not been characterized in human or rodent plasmas. Nevertheless, concordant observations have demonstrated that lipid transfer inhibitor activity could constitute an important point in determining plasma CETP activity (18Morton R.E. Steinbrunner J.V. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1843-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Morton R.E. Greene D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 836-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, transgenic mice expressing human apolipoproteins in addition to enzymes or transfer proteins provided new insights into the role of HDL apolipoproteins in lipoprotein metabolism (21Schultz J.R.

However, the precise mechanism that accounts for the effect of human A-I was not fully elucidated, and in particular it has not been clearly established whether reported variations relate directly to specific properties of human apoA-I or are secondary to alterations in the size, the lipid content, or the electrostatic charge of plasma HDL. In addition, the study of the putative effect of human versus mouse apolipoproteins in vivo was complicated by the fact that different mouse lines present different HDL levels independently of the expression of human CETP, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, or phospholipid transfer protein (28Francone O.L.

In the present study, HDL particles were isolated from plasma of transgenic mice that expressed either only human apoA-I (HuAITg mice), only human apoA-II (HuAIITg mice), or both human apoA-I and human apoA-II (HuAIAIITg mice) but that did not express human CETP. Subsequently, human HDL, control mouse HDL, HuAITg HDL, HuAIITg HDL, and HuAIAIITg HDL were analyzed for their composition and electronegative charge. The ability of the distinct HDL fractions to exchange cholesteryl esters with radiolabeled LDL in the presence of purified CETP was studied in parallel. Fresh citrated plasma from fasting normolipidemic subjects was provided by the Centre de Transfusion Sanguine (Hôpital du Bocage, Dijon, France). Fasting plasma samples from mice were collected into EDTA-containing tubes. Four distinct mouse lines were used in the present study: C57BL/6 control mice, transgenic mice AI-2 expressing human apoA-I (HuAITg mice) (24Rubin E.M. Ishida B.Y. Clift S.M. Krauss R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), transgenic mice AI-2/AIIFu-9 expressing both human apoA-I and human apoA-II (HuAIAIITg mice) (25Schultz J.R.

Cereghini S. Tailleux A. Berthou L. Fievet C. Touchet N. Schombert B. Fruchart J.-C. Zakin M.M. Denèfle P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 156: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). HDL were ultracentrifugally isolated from mouse and human plasmas as the 1.070 <d < 1.210 g/ml fraction, with one 7-h, 120,000 rpm spin at the lowest density and two 10-h, 120,000 rpm spins at the highest density in a TL 120.2 rotor in an optima TLX ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). Densities were adjusted by the addition of solid KBr. The isolated lipoproteins were dialyzed against a 10 mmol/liter Tris, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 3 mmol/liter NaN3, pH 7.4, buffer (TBS buffer). Lipoprotein-deficient plasma was obtained after precipitation of total plasma lipoproteins with dextran sulfate, MnCl2, and BaCl2 according to the general procedure described by Morton et al. (18Morton R.E. Steinbrunner J.V. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1843-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein-deficient plasma fractions were dialyzed overnight against TBS buffer. Ultracentrifugally isolated HDL were delipidated by using butanol-diisopropyl ether 40:60 (v/v) according to the general procedure of Cham and Knowles (35Cham B.E. Knowles B.R. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aqueous solution containing delipidated HDL apolipoproteins was dialyzed overnight against TBS buffer. The electrophoretic mobility (U) of HDL particles was determined by electrophoresis on 0.5% agarose gels (Paragon Lipo kit, Beckman) according to the method of Sparks and Phillips (38Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 123-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and modified as described previously (5Masson D. Athias A. Lagrost L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1579-1590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surface charges of HDL were estimated by using the equations given by Sparks and Phillips (38Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 123-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). U values were calculated by dividing the electrophoretic velocity (mean migration distance (mm)/time (s)) by the electrophoretic potential (voltage (V)/gel distance (cm)) (38Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 123-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To correct the pI-dependent retardation effects, the following equation was applied.Ucorrected=(Uagarose−0.136)/1.211Equation 1 Finally, the surface potentials of lipoproteins were calculated by using Henry's equation (38Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 123-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),S=U×6πν/DEquation 2 where D is the solvent dielectric constant and ν is the coefficient of viscosity (0.0089 poise). HDL (protein concentration, 1 g/liter) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of SDS (10 g/liter). Subsequently, HDL apolipoproteins were analyzed by SDS electrophoresis in 80–250 g/liter polyacrylamide gradient gels (Phastsystem, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. After Coomassie staining, the distribution profile of HDL apolipoproteins was obtained by image analysis on a BIO-RAD GS-670 imaging densitometer. The apparent molecular weights of individual protein bands were determined by comparison with protein standards (Pharmacia Low Molecular Weight calibration kit). The relative abundance of apoA-I and apoA-II was obtained by determining the ratio of corresponding areas under the densitometric curve. CETP was purified from 2500 ml of citrated, normolipidemic human plasma by using the sequential procedure previously described (39Lagrost L. Athias A. Gambert P. Lallemant C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 825-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active fractions were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The CETP preparation was deprived of both lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase and phospholipid transfer protein activities (39Lagrost L. Athias A. Gambert P. Lallemant C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 825-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mass concentration of CETP in active fractions was determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (40Guyard-Dangremont V. Lagrost L. Gambert P. Lallemant C. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1994; 231: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). No CETP activity was detected in isolated lipoprotein fractions or mouse plasma samples used throughout the study, and cholesteryl ester transfers were induced in all the experiments by the addition of purified human CETP. Cholesteryl ester transfer activity was determined by measuring the transfer of radiolabeled cholesteryl esters from [3H]CE-LDL to unlabeled acceptor HDL (8Lagrost L. Perségol L. Lallemant C. Gambert P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3189-3197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human LDL were biosynthetically labeled according to the procedure previously described (8Lagrost L. Perségol L. Lallemant C. Gambert P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3189-3197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated HDL fractions were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with [3H]CE-LDL (2.5 nmol of cholesterol) in the presence of partially purified CETP (4.5 μg) in a final volume of 50 μl. At the end of the incubation, thed < 1.068 and the d > 1.068g/ml fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation and transferred into counting vials containing 2 ml of scintillation fluid. The radioactivity was assayed for 2 min in a Wallac 1410 liquid scintillation counter (Pharmacia). The recovery of total radioactivity in the d < 1.068 and in the d > 1.068g/ml fraction was greater than 95%. Cholesteryl ester transfer was expressed as the percentage of total radioactivity transferred from [3H]CE-LDL toward the d> 1.068 g/ml fraction, after deduction of blank values from control mixtures which were incubated at 37 °C without CETP. Binding assays were performed by incubating CETP (2.8 mg/liter) with different concentrations of HDL particles in PBS buffer. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) (10 mmol/liter) was added to the mixture, and the incubation was extended for 30 min at room temperature. The cross-linked protein complexes were separated by SDS electrophoresis in 40–150 g/liter gels (Phastsystem) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by using a Phast semidry electrophoretic transfer system (Pharmacia) according to the general procedure described by the manufacturer. The resulting blots were blocked for 1 h in 10% low fat dried milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween and washed with PBS Tween. CETP-containing protein bands were revealed after a 1-h incubation of nitrocellulose blots with TP1 anti-CETP antibodies, which were kindly provided by Dr. Milne and Dr. Marcel (Heart Institute, Ottawa, Canada). Finally, nitrocellulose membranes were washed with TBS Tween, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled second antibodies, and then developed with a 0.5 g/liter 4-chloro-1-naphtol (Bio-Rad), 20% methanol, 0.02% H2O2 solution. The distribution profiles of cross-linked proteins were obtained by image analysis on a Bio-Rad GS-670 imaging densitometer, and the relative abundance of monomeric, non-cross-linked CETP was obtained by determining the ratio of the monomeric CETP peak to the total area under the densitometric curve. In control mixtures containing only purified CETP, more than 95% of CETP appeared as one single, sharp band corresponding to monomeric unbound CETP. All chemical assays were performed on a Cobas-Fara Centrifugal Analyzer (Hoffmann-La Roche). Protein concentration was measured with bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce). Total cholesterol and unesterified cholesterol concentrations were measured by enzymatic methods using Boehringer Mannheim reagents. Triglyceride and phospholipid concentrations were measured by enzymatic methods using Roche and Biomérieux reagents, respectively. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine the significance between data means. As shown in Table I, some differences appeared in the lipid and protein composition of the different HDL fractions studied. As compared with control mice, expression of either only human apoA-I, only human apoA-II, or both human apoA-I and human apoA-II significantly increased the protein content of HDLs and significantly reduced their phospholipid content. Overall, the expression of human apolipoproteins in mice tended to bring the surface lipoprotein parameters toward values similar to what is observed in normal human HDL. In contrast, the neutral lipid core of HDL from transgenic mice as well as from control mice did not match the neutral lipid core of human HDL that contained higher amounts of triglycerides (Table I). Interestingly, the coexpression of human apoA-I and human apoA-II in transgenic mice produced HDL particles with apoA-II to apoA-I plus apoA-II ratios similar to those observed in human HDL (Table I).Table IComposition (mass percent) of HDL from human and mouse plasmasHDL sourceCEFCTGPLProteinA-II/A-I + A-II%HuAITg mice15.2 ± 0.74.9 ± 0.41.9 ± 0.330.3 ± 1.547.7 ± 2.7NDHuAIAIITg mice10.2 ± 0.71-aSignificantly different from HuAITg mice,p < 0.05.,1-bSignificantly different from human, p < 0.05.4.3 ± 1.41.5 ± 0.931.6 ± 0.352.4 ± 0.91-bSignificantly different from human, p < 0.05.27.5 ± 1.7Hu AIITg mice9.9 ± 1.01-aSignificantly different from HuAITg mice,p < 0.05.,1-bSignificantly different from human, p < 0.05.4.2 ± 0.32.2 ± 0.331.1 ± 1.552.6 ± 0.81-bSignificantly different from human, p < 0.05.40.8 ± 4.0Control mice13.8 ± 2.36.9 ± 1.51-bSignificantly different from human, p < 0.05.2.2 ± 0.436.8 ± 1.8a,b,d,e40.2 ± 1.7a,b,d,e12.0 ± 3.0Human15.2 ± 0.93.8 ± 0.74.8 ± 1.2a,d,e,f30.1 ± 0.146.2 ± 0.620.5 ± 2.0Lipid and protein concentrations were determined as described under “Materials and Methods,” and A-II/A-I + A-II ratios were determined by densitometric scanning of 8–25% SDS polyacrylamide gradient gel as described under “Materials and Methods.” CE, cholesteryl esters; FC, free cholesterol; TG, triglycerides; PL, phospholipids; ND, not detectable.1-cApo AII corresponds to the sum of human + mouse apoAII.1-dSignificantly different from HuAIAIITg mice,p < 0.05.1-eSignificantly different from HuAIITg mice, p< 0.05.1-fSignificantly different from control mice, p< 0.05.1-a Significantly different from HuAITg mice,p < 0.05.1-b Significantly different from human, p < 0.05.

As shown in Table II, mean surface potentials of human HDL and control mouse HDL were −11.7 ± 0.1 mV and −12.7 ± 0.3 mV, respectively. HDL from HuAITg mice exhibited the highest electronegative charge, with a mean surface potential of −13.5 ± 0.5 mV. In contrast, expression of human apoA-II as well as coexpression of human apoA-I and human apoA-II in transgenic mice produced HDL particles with low electronegative charge (mean surface potentials: −11.9 ± 0.3 and −12.2 ± 0.3 mV, respectively). Overall, HDL fractions containing human apoA-II,i.e. HDL from human, HuAIAIITg mouse, and HuAIITg mouse plasmas presented significantly lower surface potentials than HDL from HuAITg mice (p < 0.05 in all cases).Table IIElectronegativity and relative affinity of CETP for HDL from human and mouse plasmasHDL sourceMean surface potentialEC50−mVnmol/literHuAITg mice13.5 ± 0.540 ± 20HuAIAIITg mice12.2 ± 0.32-aSignificantly different from HuAITg mice,p < 0.05.130 ± 20HuAIITg mice11.9 ± 0.32-aSignificantly different from HuAITg mice,p < 0.05.ND2-bND, not determined.Control mice12.7 ± 0.370 ± 25Human11.7 ± 0.12-aSignificantly different from HuAITg mice,p < 0.05.,2-cSignificantly different from control mice, p< 0.05.120 ± 30Electronegativity of the particles was estimated by their surface potential, which was calculated from their electrophoretic mobilities on 0.5% agarose gel as described under “Materials and Methods.” Relative affinity of CETP for the different particles was estimated by densitometric scanning of Western blot as described under “Materials and Methods.” EC50 values are the HDL concentrations for which 50% of the CETP is not associated with lipoprotein particles.

Fig.1 shows the cholesteryl ester transfer rates obtained with purified CETP (final concentration, 0.17 μg/ml) and with various HDL concentrations (HDL cholesterol concentration range, 20–400 nmol/ml). With all of the HDL fractions studied, cholesteryl ester transfer rates progressively increased until a maximal transfer value was obtained with an HDL cholesterol concentration of 100 nmol/ml (Fig. 1). At the optimal concentration of 100 nmol/ml, cholesteryl ester transfer rates were significantly lower with human HDL than with control mouse HDL (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1). Striking differences between distinct HDL fractions appeared, while the HDL levels kept to increase above the optimal value of 100 nmol/ml.
