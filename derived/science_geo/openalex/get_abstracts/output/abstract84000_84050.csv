https://openalex.org/W2033948248,"Mid-aged rats were either adrenalectomized and chronically maintained, or left intact and treated daily for a 9- to 10-month period with a potent analog of the peptide adrenocorticotropin (residues 4 to 9), which has some stimulant properties, or with the neural stimulant pentylenetetrazole. All three treatments reduced hippocampal morphologic correlates of brain aging (neuronal loss, glial reactivity). The pentylenetetrazole and peptide treatments also improved reversal learning. These results suggest that certain endogenous peptides, with stimulant properties, may also exert long-term, trophic effects on brain structure and function."

https://openalex.org/W1556401308,"p-Fluorosulfonylbenzoyl 5'-adenosine (FSO2BzAdo) was shown previously to be an irreversible inhibitor of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II from porcine skeletal muscle (Zoller, M. J., and Taylor, S. S. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 8363-8368). The catalytic subunit of porcine heart cAMP-dependent protein kinase was also inhibited following incubation with FSO2[14C]BzAdo, and inhibition was shown to result from the stoichiometric, covalent modification of a single lysine residue. The amino acid sequence in an extended region around the carboxybenzenesulfonyl lysine (CBS-lysine) was elucidated by characterizing both tryptic and cyanogen bromide peptides containing the 14C-modified residue. The sequence in this region was Leu-Val-Lys-His-Lys-Glu-Thr-Gly-Asn-His-Phe-Ala-Met-Lys(CBS)-Ile-Leu-Asp-Lys-Glu-Lys-Val-Val-Lys-Leu-Lys-Gln-Ile. The covalently modified residue corresponded to lysine 71 in the overall polypeptide chain. Homologies to bovine heart catalytic subunit and to a site modified by FSO2BzAdo in phosphofructokinase are considered."

https://openalex.org/W1964935018,"Viruses classified by immunologic criteria as equine herpesvirus 1 cause respiratory disease and abortion in horses. Restriction endonuclease analyses of the DNA's of viruses from animals with respiratory disease and from aborted fetuses show that the patterns for respiratory viruses, while similar to each other, are entirely different from the patterns for fetal viruses. It is therefore proposed that the DNA restriction endonuclease patterns of fetal and respiratory viruses analyzed in this study be designated as prototypic of equine herpesvirus 1 and 4, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2094861778,"The addition of ethanol or other aliphatic alcohols to rat brain membranes strongly inhibits binding of enkephalins at concentrations at which little inhibition of opiate alkaloids is seen. Inhibition is reversible, and potency increases with chain length of the alcohol. The results suggest that delta receptors are considerably more sensitive to alcohols than mu receptors. This is the first demonstration of selective inhibition of one of the postulated classes of opiate receptors by a reagent that is not a ligand for the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1545329036,"Phosphatidic acid added to the medium markedly elevated intracellular cyclic GMP content in cultured neuroblastoma N1E 115 cells. There was a significant elevation of cyclic GMP with 1 micrograms/ml and a maximum (70-fold) elevation with 100 micrograms/ml of phosphatidic acid. Other natural phospholipids did not increase, or increased only slightly, the cyclic GMP content in the cells. The elevation of cyclic GMP content by phosphatidic acid was absolutely dependent on extracellular calcium. Phosphatidic acid stimulated the influx of calcium into neuroblastoma cells 2- to 5-fold. The pattern of the calcium influx induced by phosphatidic acid was comparable to that of cyclic GMP elevation. The stimulation of calcium influx by phosphatidic acid was also observed in cultured heart cells, indicating that phosphatidic acid acts as a calcium ionophore or opens a specific calcium-gate in a variety of cell membranes. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with phospholipase C increased 32Pi labeling of phosphatidic acid, stimulated the influx of calcium, and elevated the cyclic GMP content in the cells. Thus exogenous as well as endogenous phosphatidic acid stimulates the translocation of calcium across cell membranes and, as a consequence, induces the synthesis of cyclic GMP in the neuroblastoma cells."

The unmasking of these latent receptors may contribute to the pulmonary inflammatory response characteristic of, for example, anaphylaxis and to those lung diseases characterized by the deposition of immune complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1578271139,"The effect of flavone and 7,8-benzoflavone on the metabolism of benzo[a]pyrene to fluorescent phenols by five cytochrome P-450 isozymes obtained from rabbit liver microsomes was determined. Benzo[a]pyrene metabolism was stimulated more than 5-fold by the addition of 600 microM flavone to a reconstituted monooxygenase system consisting of NADPH, cytochrome P-450 reductase, dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, and cytochrome P-450LM3c or cytochrome P-450LM4. In contrast, an inhibitory effect of flavone on benzo[a]pyrene metabolism was observed when cytochrome P-450LM2, cytochrome P-450LM3b, or cytochrome P-450LM6 was used in the reconstituted system. 7,8-Benzoflavone (50-100 microM) stimulated benzo[a]pyrene metabolism by the reconstituted monooxygenase system about 10-fold when cytochrome P-450LM3c was used, but benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylation was strongly inhibited when 7,8-benzoflavone was added to the cytochrome P-450LM6-dependent system. Smaller effects of 7,8-benzoflavone were observed on the metabolism of benzo[a]pyrene by the cytochrome P-450LM2-, cytochrome P-450LM3b-, and cytochrome P-450LM4-dependent monooxygenase systems. These results demonstrate that the activating and inhibiting effects of flavone and 7,8-benzoflavone on benzo[a]pyrene metabolism depend on the type of cytochrome P-450 used in the reconstituted monooxygenase system."

R decays exponentially with a half-life of about 8.4 h in drug-free, wild type cells. In mutant cells lacking functional kinase catalytic subunit, R is about 10 times more labile than in wild type cells. 8-bromo-cAMP, isoproterenol, and cholera toxin destabilize R in wild type cells to an extent comparable to the mutation. In contrast, dibutyryl-cAMP stabilizes R in both wild type and kinase-negative cells. Sodium butyrate has no significant effect on R stability. These results are discussed in terms of R structure and the regulation of R expression."
https://openalex.org/W1495964364,"3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetate 2,3-dioxygenase, an enzyme which catalyzes the extradiol cleavage of catechols, has been purified from Bacillus brevis. Like other extradiol-cleaving dioxygenases, this enzyme has a molecular weight of 140,000 with four subunits of 36,000 each. Unlike the other enzymes, this dioxygenase is not activated by added ferrous ion, not inhibited by cyanide or diethyldithiocarbamate, and not inactivated by H2O2. X-ray fluorescence and atomic absorption analyses show the enzyme to contain approximately 2 g atoms of manganese per mol of protein. EPR spectra are consistent with a manganese(II) center in an environment of low symmetry. This is the first report of an oxygen-activating manganese enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1535367955,"Nifurtimox is reduced by rat liver microsomes to a nitro anion-free radical as indicated by ESR spectroscopy. This subcellular fraction gives a steady state radical concentration which is proportional to the square root of the protein concentration, suggesting that the nifurtimox anion radical is a necessary intermediate in the reduction and that the radical decays through a nonenzymatic second order process. The steady state concentration of the anion radical in the microsomal system is not decreased by superoxide dismutase or catalase, thus indicating that neither the superoxide anion nor hydrogen peroxide is an intermediary in the generation of the anion radical. The steady state concentration of the anion radical in the microsomal system is also not altered in the presence of metyrapone or CO and is decreased in the presence of NADP+ and p-chloromercuribenzoate. This observation suggests that the formation of nifurtimox anion radical is mediated through NADPH-cytochrome P-450 (c) reductase and not by the cytochrome P-450 system. In accordance with this interpretation, a model system consisting of NADPH and FMN-reduced nifurtimox to the nitro anion-free radical. Nifurtimox anion radical generation is significantly stimulated by rat brain and testes homogenates. The enhanced free radical formation may be the basic cause of nifurtimox toxicity in mammals."

https://openalex.org/W1482862538,"Bovine thyroglobulin has been subjected to sequential glycohydrolase treatment in order to define further the components of the carbohydrate chain which are important in binding of the glycoprotein to bovine thyroid membranes. Preparations of asialoagalactothyroglobulin exhibit the best binding, suggesting that exposed N-acetylglucosamine residues on the B carbohydrate chain of thyroglobulin play an important role in the interaction of thyroglobulin with the thyroid membranes. Enhanced binding of asialoagalactothyroglobulin to microsomal, lysosomal, and Golgi membranes, as well as to thyroid cells in culture, was also observed. Isopycnic rubidium chloride gradient centrifugation, a procedure used in the isolation of thyroglobulin molecules with a low iodine content, also isolates thyroglobulin molecules with a low sialic acid content and with an increased ability to interact with wheat germ agglutinin, a lectin which recognizes exposed N-acetylglucosamine residues. The studies further indicate that there is a correlation between iodine content, exposed N-acetylglucosamine residues, and the binding of thyroglobulin to thyroid membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1608472360,"The localization of acid hydrolases was examined in Chinese hamster ovary cells with defective mannose 6-phosphate receptors; these mutants had been shown to exhibit reduced uptake and altered binding of exogenously added acid hydrolase (Robbins, A. R., Myerowitz, R., Youle, R. J., Murray, G. J., and Neville, D. M., Jr. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 10618-10622). Cells were grown in the presence of [3H]mannose, alpha-L-iduronidase and beta-hexosaminidase were immunoprecipitated sequentially, electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, and detected by fluorography. About 55% of the alpha-L-iduronidase and beta-hexosaminidase synthesized by the mutants in 12 h was found in the growth medium; parental cells secreted only approximately 15%. The mutants also secreted 2 to 6 times more alpha-mannosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and alpha-L-fucosidase than the parent as determined by measurements of enzyme activity. Intracellular levels of these enzymes were reduced in the mutants. The mutants secreted acid hydrolases in the precursor forms, within the cells these enzymes resided in lysosomes and were processed normally; thus, the mutants appeared aberrant only with respect to distribution of hydrolases between intracellular and extracellular compartments. [35S]methionine-labeled beta-hexosaminidase and alpha-L-iduronidase secreted by the mutants were taken up normally by both human fibroblasts and wild type CHO cells, and this uptake was inhibited by mannose 6-phosphate. Thus, the elevated secretion of acid hydrolases was not due to alteration of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker on the enzymes, but appears to result from alterations in the mannose 6-phosphate receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1576873106,"The dissociation kinetics of 125I-labeled nerve growth factor (NGF) from dissociated cells of the 9-day chick embryo dorsal root ganglion were studied following preincubation for 2 h at 25 degrees C with 15 to 30 pM125I-NGF. Subsequent dilution in the presence of 4 nM NGF resulted in greater initial dissociation than occurred with dilution alone. This effect was largely limited to the first half-hour after addition of unlabeled NGF; thereafter, cell-associated radioactivity declined at the same rate for both dilution conditions. In addition, dissociation kinetics did not follow a single first order rate law in the presence or absence of excess unlabeled NGF. These data are not consistent with a model of a single class of high affinity NGF receptors, whether or not they are noninteracting or negatively cooperative. Alternative models based on multiple noninteracting or negatively cooperative receptors might explain these results, but the current data do not allow clear discrimination among them."

https://openalex.org/W1602656876,"Addition of to cultured chick embryo hepatocytes caused a concentration-dependent impairment of phenobarbital-mediated induction of delta-aminolevulinate (ALA) synthase resembling the glucose observed in rodents in vivo. This effect occurred in the complete absence of extrahepatic factors such as serum and hormones. Fructose, glycerol, and lactate mimicked the inhibitory effect on ALA synthase induction, whereas 2-deoxyglucose and 3-O-methylglucose augmented the induction evoked by phenobarbital. 2-Deoxyglucose reversed the effect of glucose, glycerol, and lactate on ALA synthase induction suggesting that the effect is mediated by free or 6-phosphate or a nonglycolytic metabolite of 6-phosphate. The phenobarbital-mediated induction of cytochrome P-450 hemoprotein(s) and its monooxygenase function were concomitantly diminished by glucose. However, this inhibitory effect or was reversible by the addition of exogenous heme or ALA suggesting that the primary target of the effect is ALA synthase induction and not synthesis of apocytochrome P-450. Glucagon and dibutyryl cAMP enhanced the induction of ALA synthase and cytochrome P-450 by phenobarbital and partially counteracted the effect on both enzymes suggesting that the effect may be mediated by changes in cAMP levels. Although insulin did not alter induction of ALA synthase, it impaired induction of cytochrome P-450 even in the presence of glucagon and cAMP. These data may be relevant for the treatment with and heme of patients with inducible hepatic porphyria."
https://openalex.org/W1566561553,"Ovarian granulosa cells have specific receptors for lutropin and human choriogonadotropin (hCG). To investigate the nature of the receptor, several different photo-cross-linkable derivatives of radioiodinated hCG were incubated with porcine granulosa cells and hormone derivative-receptor complexes extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100. The extracted complexes appeared in a single peak on gel permeations and in rat zonal sedimentation studies. The estimated molecular weight was found to be 250,000-370,000 with an associated s value of 7.7 +/- 0.3. When Triton X-100 extracts were examined by gel electrophoresis, the autoradiograph revealed four bands. Three were conspicuous, corresponding for molecular weights of 96,000 +/- 5,000, 76,000 +/- 4,000, and 73,000 +/- 4,000, but a fourth band, corresponding to a molecular weight of 120,000 +/- 6,000, was less well defined. Reducing agents, 20 mM dithiothreitol and 2% beta-mercaptoethanol, acid, and 3 M urea did not affect the production of the bands. Furthermore, the bands once formed were resistant to these agents, indicating 1) covalent nondisulfide bond formation in photoaffinity labeling and 2) noncovalent association of photoaffinity-labeled membrane components with the natural hormone receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1761207846,"Endoglycosidase H is one of a large number of enzymes secreted by Streptomyces plicatus and other Streptomyces species. When the structural gene for this enzyme is introduced into Escherichia coli attached to the plasmid pBR-322 or Charon 4 phage, the enzyme is synthesized and is found in the periplasmic space, culture medium, and cells. Attachment of the UV-5 lac promoter to a site in the plasmid adjacent to the Streptomyces insert stimulates enzyme synthesis as much as 100-fold. This result demonstrates that transcription of the Streptomyces gene can be initiated from sequences outside of the Streptomyces insert. Initiation of transcription on a Streptomyces promoter is also a suggested but unproven possibility. In contrast to the situation in Streptomyces, where the enzyme has a molecular weight of 27,000, the enzyme made in E. coli has a molecular weight of approximately 30,000. Possible explanations for this difference in size are lack of cleavage of the Streptomyces secretion signal sequence in E. coli or protein processing by enzymes secreted into the medium by STreptomyces."
https://openalex.org/W1616972994,"cAMP-dependent protein kinase was examined in mitochondria and cytosol prepared from different-sized antral follicles and corpora lutea of porcine ovaries. In all ovarian tissues examined except small follicles, protein kinase-specific activity was significantly higher in mitochondria than in cytosol, with the highest to lowest activities being found in medium (4-6 mm) follicles, large (7-12 mm) follicles, corpora lutea, and small (1-3 mm) follicles, respectively. Using the photoaffinity analogue [32P]8-N3cAMP, two major cAMP binding proteins with Mr = 47,000 (the apparent regulatory subunit of protein kinase Type I) and 54,000-56,000 (Type II) were found in all ovarian preparations. Type II was predominant in the cytosol of all ovarian samples, with the cytosolic Type I to Type II ratio increasing from approximately 0.05 in small and medium follicles top approximately 0.20 in large follicles and corpora lutea. In contrast, ovarian mitochondrial preparations contained relatively more Type I than did cytosol, with the mitochondrial Type I to Type II ratio increasing from approximately 0.50 in small and medium follicles to 0.88 in large follicles and 2.96 in corpora lutea. Also, mitochondrial [4-14C]cholesterol conversion and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase activities increased with follicle size and luteinization. These results suggest that Type I may play a role in the regulation of ovarian mitochondrial steroidogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1559378782,"The apparent target sizes of the basal and calmodulin-dependent activities of calmodulin-activated phosphodiesterase from bovine brain were estimated using target theory analysis of data from radiation inactivation experiments. Whether crude or highly purified samples were irradiated, the following results were obtained. Low doses of radiation caused a 10 to 15% increase in basal activity, which, with further irradiation, decayed with an apparent target size of approximately 60,000 daltons. Calmodulin-dependent activity decayed with an apparent target size of approximately 105,000 daltons. The percentage stimulation of enzyme activity by calmodulin decreased markedly as a function of radiation dosage. These observations are consistent with results predicted by computer-assisted modeling based on the assumptions that: 1) the calmodulin-activated phosphodiesterase exists as a mixture of monomers which are fully active in the absence of calmodulin and dimers which are inactive in the absence of calmodulin; 2) in the presence of calmodulin, a dimer exhibits activity equal to that of two monomers; 3) on radiations destruction of a dimer, an active monomer is generated. This monomer-dimer hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for and definition of basal and calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2025784310,"The metabolic and genetic factors leading to deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in cartilage of patients with chondrocalcinosis are not well understood. Analysis of cultured fibroblasts and lymphoblasts from 12 affected members of a large kindred showed a mean concentration of intracellular inorganic pyrophosphate two times greater than that in cells from unaffected family members or normal, unrelated volunteers. Increased intracellular pyrophosphate may, therefore, be a biochemical marker for the heterozygous expression of the chondrocalcinosis gene."
https://openalex.org/W1489481765,"Phosphorylation and synthesis of type I regulatory subunit (RI) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase were studied using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins from intact S49 mouse lymphoma cells. [32P]Phosphate labeling, peptide mapping, and acid hydrolysis confirm that charge heterogeneity in RI results from phosphorylation of a single serine residue. In drug-free cells, phosphorylation proceeds to a steady state proportion of 90 to 95% of total RI with a half-time of about 25 min. The rate and steady state extent of RI phosphorylation are reduced by some, but not all, agents causing intracellular kinase activation. These results suggest that RI might assume different conformations in association with different amounts of cAMP or different analogs of cAMP. Endogenous kinase activation has no immediate effect on RI synthesis but leads to a moderate increase in RI synthesis after several hours; this induction occurs with all agents tested. Mutants of S49 cells lacking catalytic activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase exhibit reduced phosphorylation and synthesis of RI. Comparative studies suggest that the phosphorylation of RI and its induction by kinase activation are fairly general phenomena; the extent of RI phosphorylation and the relative rate of RI synthesis are variable among cell types."

These probes react specifically with those polypeptide chains exposed to lipids, thereby labeling them radioactively. Highly resolving gel electrophoretic conditions have been used to determine the patterns of labeling. Core protein I, cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, and polypeptides VI, VII, VIII, and IX contribute to the lipid-protein boundary of Complex III.

The purification procedure described here takes advantage of the relatively unique complexation of the enzyme with blue dextran-Sepharose in the presence of a nonionic detergent. Unlike preparations of the enzyme previously described, the bovine brain enzyme is monoisozymic and each polypeptide chain can be phosphorylated by a nucleoside triphosphate substrate. Catalytically functional forms of the enzyme having lower pI values can be generated by proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1552766225,"Mature, closed circular mouse mitochondrial DNA contains a significant number of ribonucleotides throughout the genome. Previous studies have implicated the two origins of DNA replication as preferred sites of ribonucleotide retention. We have analyzed the site specificity of ribosubstitution by direct sizing of alkali-treated restriction fragments in comparison with the DNA sequence of untreated restriction fragments of cloned mouse mitochondrial DNA. These results have confirmed the observations that ribonucleotides are retained at the two origins of replication and are most likely remnants of RNA priming events associated with DNA replication. The map location of ribonucleotides at the light strand origin of replication has been refined to a triplet nucleotide (5'-CGG-3') in the light strand initiation region. This approach has demonstrated that all four deoxyribonucleotides are subject to ribosubstitution and no single base (or subset of the four bases) predominates. An examination of selected regions of the mitochondrial DNA genome including the putative coding region for cytochrome oxidase subunit III and regions containing the genes for tRNAPhe, tRNAVal, 12 S rRNA, and 16 S rRNA reveals preferred sites for ribosubstitution. These preferred sites do not relate in any obvious way to the functional aspects of these domains. In addition, the data indicate that every position in the DNA sequences examined can be ribosubstituted at a very low frequency."
https://openalex.org/W1488427115,"Bovine thyroglobulin was treated with increasing ratios of succinic anhydride, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, tetranitromethane, and N-acetylimidazole in an attempt to assess the role of lysine or tyrosine residues in binding to thyroid membrane receptors. Extensive succinylation results in dissociation to 12 S thyroglobulin with retention of a considerable portion of the three-dimensional structure. Only 25% of the lysine residues can be modified by trinitrophenylation without affecting inter-subunit interactions. Succinylation as well as trinitrophenylation increases the affinity of thyroglobulin for the membrane receptor by a factor of 2. The binding of thyroglobulin to the membrane was reduced after nitration of 30% of the tyrosyl residues with tetranitromethane. O-Acetylation of 40-70% of the tyrosyl residues by N-acetylimidazole nearly abolished the ability of thyroglobulin to bind to the membrane. Removal of the O-acetyl group with hydroxylamine restored the binding properties. The results indicate that tyrosyl residues play an important role in thyroglobulin interactions with thyroid membranes."

Significant in vitro translation of the beta-lactamase mRNA occurs in the absence of the initiation factor fraction as is characteristic of translation of mRNAs of Gram-positive origin.

Results with GDP selectively enriched with 17O either in the alpha-phosphate or in the beta-phosphate revealed that GDP was a beta-monodentate ligand for Mn(II) in the complex with the protein. Results with 17O-enriched water showed that two water molecules are coordinated to the Mn(II). The EPR spectrum for the complex is characteristic of octahedral coordination for Mn(II).

LDHk is found with both 35,000- and 22,000-dalton subunits, although these probably cleave from a 57,000-dalton precursor. In studies utilizing a temperature-sensitive transforming gene mutant of the Kirsten sarcoma virus, we find in vivo expression of LDHk is also temperature-sensitive. In studies using either crude cell-free extracts or purified LDHk, we find the enzyme from cells infected with a temperature-sensitive transforming gene mutant of KiMSV is thermolabile relative to that from wild type KiMSV-infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1589299101,"Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity in supernatants of homogenates of kidneys from vitamin D-deficient chicks is decreased to 70% of the level measured in kidneys from normal chicks. Activity was restored to normal by oral administration of vitamin D or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for 1 or 2 weeks. Both isozymes of cAMP-dependent protein kinase were reduced to the same extent by vitamin D deficiency. The decreased enzyme activity could not be accounted for by a shift to the particulate fraction nor by an increased requirement for cyclic AMP. A heat stable, trichloroacetic acid-precipitable, trypsin-labile inhibitor of protein kinase activity was identified and quantitated in kidneys from vitamin D-deficient chicks (16 to 26 units/mg of protein) and from those given vitamin D (2 to 6 units/mg of protein). The measured difference in inhibitor levels could not be attributed to differential stability in kidney homogenates from vitamin D-deficient or -repleted chicks. The observed increase in inhibitor level with vitamin D deficiency is not sufficient to account for the decrease in cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity, suggesting that the total amount of this enzyme activity is reduced in vitamin D deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1565467045,"A new in vitro approach is used to investigate the specificity of purified yeast RNA polymerase B (II). The template is supercoiled, the transcription is primed by a dinucleotide, and the transcripts are analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after synthesis in the absence of one nucleoside triphosphate. Under these conditions, two recombinant plasmids carrying the gene or part of the gene for yeast alcohol dehydrogenase I direct the synthesis of a very limited number of oligonucleotides. Elongation of these prelabeled oligomers, using unlabeled substrates, occurs in a discontinuous way. A major transcript of 200 nucleotides accumulates transiently. Southern hybridization shows that it is initiated about 1,400 bases upstream from the origin of the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase I gene. A minor start was identified, by a modified runoff experiment, at position -35 from the AUG initiation codon. The location of this site is related to the presumptive in vivo transcription starts. The selectivity disappears when the template is a truncated DNA. Then, initiation occurs predominantly at nicks introduced by the restriction enzymes."

Purkinje neurons in hypothyroid rats fired significantly faster and were less sensitive to iontophoretically applied norepinephrine than those in control rats. The subsensitivity of the Purkinje neurons appeared to be primarily due to an alteration in the β-receptor—adenylate cyclase complex, because the sensitivity of these cells to locally applied N6-monobutyryl adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (N6 cyclic AMP) did not change significantly.

Total phospholipid phosphorus, as well as lecithin and phosphatidylethanolamine levels, exhibited stepwise increases during the cell cycle with step increments beginning just prior to new rounds of bud formation. Phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine levels, on the other hand, showed what have been interpreted to be peak concentrations near the time of bud formation. Cardiolipin content varied considerably and was dependent upon the carbon source of the growth medium. Glucose-grown cells exhibited peak concentrations of cardiolipin near the time of bud formation, with marked decreases after this time. In contrast, galactose-grown synchronous cells exhibited stepwise increments in cardiolipin content, with step increases occurring near the time of new rounds of bud formation. Step or peak increases in cardiolipin, as well as all other phospholipids, were found to coincide with the time of stepwise increases in cytochrome c oxidase activity in these cells. No correlations were observed between the elaboration of mitochondrial membranes during the synchronous cell cycle and the observed patterns of phospholipid increase."
https://openalex.org/W1480651013,"This report explores the biochemical basis for clonal variation in adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity in the Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cell line. We demonstrate that the level of a specific protein, designated p68, is significantly correlated with the ability of adrenocorticotropin to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity among Y1 subclones (p = 0.004; r = 0.65). p68 was characterized by its molecular weight in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels (Mr = 68,000) and by its isoelectric point as determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (pI = 7.2). On two-dimensional gels, the protein migrated as a major spot with satellite spots 0.1 pH unit on either side. Homogenates and plasma membrane fractions from clones highly responsive to ACTH had large amounts of p68. In homogenates from highly responsive clones p68 represented 10 to 12% of the total protein. Homogenates and plasma membrane fractions from clones insensitive to ACTH were deficient in p68. In homogenates from the insensitive clones Y6 and OS3, p68 represented less than or equal 0.8% of the total protein. A somatic cell hybrid, formed by fusion of these two ACTH-insensitive clones recovered ACTH-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity and concomitantly expressed appreciable levels of p68. It is suggested that p68 may regulate the transfer of information from the occupied ACTH receptor ot the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase."

https://openalex.org/W1501649786,"The subunits of the cytochrome oxidase from bovine heart were isolated in large quantities suitable for amino acid sequence studies. The preparation of subunits III, IV, V, VI, and VII for sequence determination can be achieved without employing sodium dodecyl sulfate. The method presented essentially involves pyridine extraction, pH fractionation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and various types of column chromatography. However, subunits I and II can be prepared only in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate by molecular sieve chromatography; subunit III can also be isolated in this manner. The separation of subunits is found to be hindered by phospholipids associated with the enzyme and therefore the phospholipid-depleted preparation is used as the starting material. The molecular weights of subunits I, II, III, IV, V, VI, and VII are 40,000, 21,000, 14,800, 13,500, 11,600, 9,500, and 7,600, respectively. These values are based on the results of the conventional Weber and Osborn method of gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The amino termini of subunits I and II have been determined as N-formylmethionine, and those of subunits III, IV, V, VI, and VII are alanine, alanine, serine, alanine, and an N-acetyl-blocked residue, respectively. The carboxyl termini for subunits I to VII are lysine, leucine, lysine, histidine, valine, isoleucine, and valine, respectively. The complete amino acid sequence of some subunits has been published and that of other subunits will be reported elsewhere in collaboration with the Amino Acid Sequence Group of Cytochrome Oxidase at the University of Hawaii."
https://openalex.org/W1567771543,"The chromatographic behavior of a heterogeneous protein mixture and of a series of homogeneous proteins on the immobilized dye tetraiodofluorescein has been observed and analyzed. Less than 6%, of the millimolar concentration of dye immobilized to a porous agarose matrix is accessible to protein. The affinity of a protein for immobilized dye is dramatically increased by insertion of apolar spacer atoms between the dye and the matrix. Dye columns constructed with a 9-atom spacer can be used to advantage for the retention and competitive elution of proteins not found previously amenable to dye chromatography."
