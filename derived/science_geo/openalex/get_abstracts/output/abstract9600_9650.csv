https://openalex.org/W1975234236,Microwear details on teeth of two sympatric species of hyrax are correlated with major dietary differences observed in the wild. Grazing (Procavia johnstoni) and browsing (Heterohyrax brucei) species can be distinguished. The results show that diets of extinct species may be deduced from tooth microwear.

https://openalex.org/W1973779810,"The hypothesis tested was that the effects of early experiences are asymmetrically distributed in the two brain hemispheres. Litters were either handled or not handled between birth and weaning, and the weanlings were reared in either laboratory cages or enriched environments between 21 and 50 days. When approximately 135 days old, animals within each of the four treatment groups had a right neocortical ablation, a left neocortical ablation, a sham operation, or no surgery. About 1 month later, all animals were given the open-field test for emotionality and exploratory behavior. Ablating either the right or left neocortex increased the activity scores of nonhandled controls, but there was no evidence of lateralization. However, the groups handled in infancy did show lateralization. Ablating the left brain did not significantly increase activity, but ablating the right brain caused extreme scores: handled rats without enrichment experience were the most active, and handled rats also placed into the enriched environment had near-zero scores in the open field."

https://openalex.org/W1538274312,"The phosphorus NMR spectra of intracellular ATP in glycolyzing human red blood cells maintained at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 have been obtained and quantitated under completely aerobic and anaerobic conditions. A comparison of the separation between the alphaP and betaP resonances and the alpha-beta and beta-gamma 31P spin-spin coupling constants of intracellular ATP with appropriate controls directly reveals that 84 +/- 4% and 78 +/- 4% of the total ATP are complexed to Mg2+ in the aerobic and anaerobic states of the cell, respectively. This determination does not differentiate between molecules free in solution and those bound to hemoglobin due to rapid exchange on the NMR time scale of free and complexed ATP. From these data and the prior knowledge of the interactions of various phosphorylated metabolites with hemoglobin and Mg2+, the intracellular concentration of free Mg2+ is determined to be 0.25 +/- 0.07 mM in the aerobic and 0.67 +/- 0.15 mM in the anaerobic state in a sample of normal red blood cells. Knowledge of free Mg2+ permitted a calculation of the distribution of ATP, ADP, glycerate-2,3-P2, and hemoglobin among their free and complexed forms. The results indicate that approximately 40% of the glycerate-2,3-P2 and ATP are complexed to hemoglobin even in aerobic cells and approximately 90% and approximately 60%, respectively, in completely anaerobic cells. The level of free ATP decreases 3-fold anaerobically whereas the MgATP changes very little. The intracellular level of MgADP increases about 2-fold upon deoxygenation. Since the Mg2+ in the red cell is largely complexed, the 3-fold increase in free Mg2+ under fully anaerobic conditions would significantly affect the rates of enzymatic reactions."

When hens receive a combination of 1,25(OH)2D3 and 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3[24,25(OH)2D3], hatchability equivalent to that with hens given vitamin D3 is obtained. These results suggest a biological role for 24,25(OH)2D3 not previously recognized."
https://openalex.org/W2040074029,"The cytosol extracted from a vascular endothelial cell line binds [3H]estradiol with high affinity and a high degree of specificity. In contrast, in experiments performed with cytosol labeled in the intact cell, progesterone and, to a smaller extent, testosterone gave an apparent inhibition of estradiol binding. These data support the concept that ovarian hormones may influence the role of the endothelium in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2056572339,"Rebound insomnia followed the withdrawal of three benzodiazepine hypnotic drugs, each of which had been administered in a single nightly dose for only short-term periods. The intense worsening of sleep is attributed to the short duration of the action of these drugs. A hypothesis involving benzodiazepine receptors in the brain is proposed in which there is a delay or lag in replacement of endogenous benzodiazepine-like molecules after the abrupt withdrawal of exogenous drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2014761464,"The patterns of integration of the viral genome have been analyzed in four hamster cell lines transformed by adenovirus type 12 (Ad12). It has previously been shown that in each of the cell lines HA12/7, T637, A2497-2 and A2497-3, the viral genome persists in multiple copies, and that different parts of the viral DNA are represented non-stoichiometrically (Fanning and Doerfler, 1976). All four cell lines are oncogenic when injected into hamsters. The DNA from each of the cell lines was extracted and cleaved in different experiments with restriction endonucleases Bam HI, Bgl II, Eco RI, Hind III, Hpa II or Sma I. The DNA fragments were separated on 1% agarose slab gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters by the Southern technique. Ad12 DNA sequences were detected by hybridization to Ad12 DNA, which was 32 P-labeled by nick translation, and by subsequent autoradiography. In some experiments, the 32P-labeled Eco RI restriction endonuclease fragments of Ad12 DNA were used to investigate the distribution of specific segments of the viral genome in the cellular DNA. For each cell line, a distinct and specific pattern of integrated viral DNA sequences is observed for each of the restriction endonucleases used. Moreover, viral sequences complementary to the isolated Eco RI restriction endonuclease fragments are also distributed in patterns specific for each cell line. There are striking differences in integration patterns among the four different lines; there are also similarities. Because the organization of cellular genes in virus-transformed as compared to normal cells has not yet been determined, conclusions about the existence or absence of specific integration sites for adenovirus DNA appear premature. Analysis of the integration patterns of Ad12 DNA in the four hamster lines investigated reveals that some of the viral DNA molecules are fragmented prior to or during integration. Analysis with specific restriction endonuclease fragments demonstrates that the Eco RI B, D and E fragments, comprising a contiguous segment from 0.17-0.62 fractional length units of the viral DNA, remain intact during integration in a portion of the viral DNA molecules. Although each cell line carries multiple copies of Ad12 DNA, the viral DNA sequences are concentrated in a small number of distinct size classes of fragments. This finding is compatible with, but does not prove, the notion that at least a portion of the viral DNA sequences, is integrated into repetitive sequences, or else that the integrated viral sequences have been amplified after integration. In the three cell lines which were tested, the integration pattern is stable over many generations, with continuous passage-twice weekly-of cells for 6-7 months. In the three cell lines which were examined, the integration pattern is identical in a number of randomly isolated clones. Hence it can be concluded that the patterns of integration are identical among all cells in a population of a given line of transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2167162525,Visually evoked potentials recorded from two types of human ocular albinos demonstrated significant hemispheric asymmetry following monocular stimulation. The asymmetry is indicative of disorganization of retinogeniculostriate projections similar to that reported for mammals with total albinism. Abnormal optic projections are associated with lack of ocular pigment and are not associated with any specific generalized pigment defect.
https://openalex.org/W2108415323,"Maternal deprivation was associated with a decline in immunoreactive growth hormone in the serum of rat pups. Pups that were returned to the mother showed a rapid reversal in this deprivation-induced decrease. The change in growth hormone concentration was not accompanied by changes in the concentrations of prolactin, thyrotropin, or corticosterone in the serum, but were correlated with alteration in the activity of ornithine decarboxylase in the brain. Treatment of neonatal rat pups with cyprohepatadine, a serotonin antagonist that suppresses growth hormone secretion, resulted in a significant decline in both serum growth hormone concentration and brain ornithine decarboxylase activity. These findings suggest that maternal deprivation elicits a specific suppression of growth hormone release which mediates the decrease in ornithine decarboxylase activity. The study is consistent with clinical findings of impaired growth hormone ""responsitivity"" in human maternal deprivation syndrome."

Eight of these children were wearing well-washed sleepwear and the possibility of absorption of tris-BP from well-washed sleepwear discussed. 2,3-Dibromopropanol was not found in the urines of one child and one adult who had never worn tris-BP-treated garments."

https://openalex.org/W1989815501,"We present electron microscopic and X-ray diffraction evidence concerning the structural organization of condensed DNA within a series of T4 bacteriophage with the following head morphologies: prolate (wild-type), isometric and giant (with greatly increased axial ratio). In all cases, the DNA helix segments are locally parallel and 27 Å apart. For the giant particles, we show that the DNA forms a large coil whose axis is perpendicular to the axis of the phage tail. This evidence, combined with previous results from a series of isometric bacteriophages ( Earnshaw and Harrison, 1977 Earnshaw W.C. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1977; 268: 598-602 Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar ), leads to a model for the organization of condensed DNA that may apply to most dsDNA-containing bacteriophages."

These results are discussed in terms of a thermodynamic model for turnover control, in which the rate of intracellular protein degradation is controlled by intramolecular conformation equilibria. A peculiar exception is provided by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase which is stable in vivo, but not in vitro."

Microscopic observation revealed highly localized exocytotic responses involving punctate extrusion of individual granules. Calcium delivered from the vesicles to the cytoplasm is apparently a sufficient stimulus to initiate exocytosis. The results support the calcium hypothesis of stimulus-secretion coupling.
https://openalex.org/W1973234552,"MANY samples hf ‘Sigma grade’ ATP from Sigma Chemical Co. reportedly contained an impurity which induces anomalous kinetics of (Na, K)-ATPase activity1–3. This impurity has recently been identified as vanadate4, and shown to inhibit (Na, K)–ATPase from kidney4 and red blood cells5. These findings have received considerable interest because of a possible physiological role of vanadate as an endogenous regulator of (Na, K)–ATPase activity3–5. We now report that vanadate is capable of producing positive inotropic effects in electrically driven papillary muscles isolated from cats."
https://openalex.org/W2077660439,"Impure and pure samples of saccharin (2 milligrams per milliliter) did not produce oncogenic transformation of C3H/10T1/2, clone 8, mouse embryo fibroblasts. However, after treatment of the cells with a nontransforming initiating dose (0.1 microgram per milliliter) of 3-methylcholanthrene, continuous treatment with either sample of saccharin (100 micrograms per milliliter) led to significant transformation. It is concluded that in this system saccharin is a cocarcinogen, probably functioning as a promoting agent that is 1000-fold less active than the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate."
https://openalex.org/W2080363621,"Like the chelipeds, the claw closer muscles of the adult lobster are asymmetric (dipmorphic). In the crusher claw the closer muscle is composed entirely of slow fibers, and in the cutter claw it has 65 to 75 percent fast fibers and 25 to 35 percent slow fibers. While claw placement in the adult is essentially random, it can be demonstrated in two ways that the muscle fiber properties are not genetically fixed: (i) if one claw is removed in the fourth and early fifth stages, the remaining closer muscle develops all slow muscle fibers, and (ii) if the animals are raised in smooth-bottomed containers, both claws can become cutter types, having closer muscles with more than 50 percent fast fibers. Thus, as in vertebrate skeletal muscle, the properties of lobster closer muscle fibers can be transformed by various experimental manipulations."
https://openalex.org/W2007129302,"The vascular endothelium consists of a single layer of flattened, contact-inhibited cells that line the inner surface of blood vessels. One important characteristic of these cells is that circulating blood cells should not adhere or become activated by contact with the endothelial cell surface that is exposed to the bloodstream. This non-thrombogenic surface is a characteristic not only of the endothelium in vivo, but also of cultured endothelial cells such as the clonal line of adult bovine aortic endothelium used in this study. Using the mutagen 2-chloroacetaldehyde, we have been able to isolate cell lines of endothelial origin which have stable alterations in morphology and in the ability to bind platelets to the upper cell surface. Other cell surface properties that are altered in these cells include the distribution of a major cell surface glycoprotein (LETS, fibronectin), the response to incubation with a multivalent lectin (concanavalin A) and the distribution of iodinatable cell surface proteins. The binding of platelets to the endothelial cell variants can be quantified by radioisotope labeling of the platelets and measurement of the amount of label on cell-associated platelets. When platelets were incubated with 14C-serotonin prior to incubation with the variant endothelial cells, it was found that the binding of platelets to these cells was not accompanied by release of serotonin from platelet granules. This is in contrast to the release reported when platelets are allowed to adhere to subendothelial vessel components, and demonstrates that adhesion to endothelial surfaces is dissociable from the platelet release reaction. The use of such endothelial cell variants should allow elucidation of the biochemical properties of the normal endothelial cell surface which render it nonthrombogenic."

https://openalex.org/W2030862068,"A new bioassay for chemical attractants of aquatic snails demonstrated that Biomphalaria glabrata could be attracted to or trapped in the vicinity of homogenates of lettuce. Fractionation of homogenates revealed the amino acids glutamate and proline and the primary attractants. Attraction was specific for the L form of glutamate. Proline appeared to stimulate reproductive activity. Glutathione, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and a number of other compounds had no effect. Extracts of lyophilized snail tissue also attracted other snails and may thus contain pheromones. These results permit formulation and testing of controlled-release attractants designed to overcome the repellant effects of slow-release molluscicides, as well as the design of stimulants to be used with no-release poisons."

Renal tubular handling of glucose, phosphate, sodium, potassium, uric acid, and amino acids was abnormal, and in vitro uptake of labeled lysine, glycine, and alpha-methyl-D-glucoside by renal cortical slices was impaired. Histopathology was normal except for enlarged nuclei in some renal tubule cells. These Basenji dogs, which may be genetically affected, represent a likely model for idiopathic Fanconi syndrome in humans."

https://openalex.org/W1998302515,"The molecular conformation of the halogen-free thyroxine analog 4-methoxy-3,5,3'-trimethyl-L-thyronine -n-acetyl ethyl ester has been determined by x-ray diffraction techniques. The unsubstituted parent compound, trimethylthyronine, has significant biological activity in rat thymocyte tests when compared with the thyroid hormone 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3). Although no activity data are available for the analog studied, it is presumed to be inactive because of the 4-methoxy blocking group. The observed conformation of this structure is similar to that found for the natural hormone T(3). The 3'-methyl group is distal, the overall conformation is cisoid, and the diphenyl ether conformation is twist-skewed. The results of this diffraction study show that methyl substituents are capable of maintaining the thyronine conformation required for hormonal activity; they suggest that iodine enhances hormone-protein binding because of the electronic effects it produces either by alteration of molecular charge distributions or by direct charge-transfer interactions with the serum or nuclear binding proteins."
