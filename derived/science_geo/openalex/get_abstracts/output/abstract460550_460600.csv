Phenotypic screening of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum has yielded almost 30,000 submicromolar hits in recent years. To make this collection more accessible, a collection of 400 chemotypes has been assembled, termed the Malaria Box. Half of these compounds were selected based on their drug-like properties and the others as molecular probes. These can now be requested as a pharmacological test set by malaria biologists, but importantly by groups working on related parasites, as part of a program to make both data and compounds readily available. In this paper, the analysis and selection methodology and characteristics of the compounds are described."

The accumulation of these proteinaceous aggregates in AD correlates with synaptic loss and severity of dementia. Identifying the kinases involved in the pathological phosphorylation of tau may identify novel targets for AD. We used an unbiased approach to study the effect of 352 human kinases on their ability to phosphorylate tau at epitopes associated with AD. The kinases were overexpressed together with the longest form of human tau in human neuroblastoma cells. Levels of total and phosphorylated tau (epitopes Ser(P)-202, Thr(P)-231, Ser(P)-235, and Ser(P)-396/404) were measured in cell lysates using AlphaScreen assays. GSK3α, GSK3β, and MAPK13 were found to be the most active tau kinases, phosphorylating tau at all four epitopes. We further dissected the effects of GSK3α and GSK3β using pharmacological and genetic tools in hTau primary cortical neurons. Pathway analysis of the kinases identified in the screen suggested mechanisms for regulation of total tau levels and tau phosphorylation; for example, kinases that affect total tau levels do so by inhibition or activation of translation. A network fishing approach with the kinase hits identified other key molecules putatively involved in tau phosphorylation pathways, including the G-protein signaling through the Ras family of GTPases (MAPK family) pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2117185974,"We describe a novel heterothallic species in Aspergillus section Fumigati, namely A. felis (neosartorya-morph) isolated from three host species with invasive aspergillosis including a human patient with chronic invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, domestic cats with invasive fungal rhinosinusitis and a dog with disseminated invasive aspergillosis. Disease in all host species was often refractory to aggressive antifungal therapeutic regimens. Four other human isolates previously reported as A. viridinutans were identified as A. felis on comparative sequence analysis of the partial β-tubulin and/or calmodulin genes. A. felis is a heterothallic mold with a fully functioning reproductive cycle, as confirmed by mating-type analysis, induction of teleomorphs within 7 to 10 days in vitro and ascospore germination. Phenotypic analyses show that A. felis can be distinguished from the related species A. viridinutans by its ability to grow at 45°C and from A. fumigatus by its inability to grow at 50°C. Itraconazole and voriconazole cross-resistance was common in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2016040231,"The post-translational modification of tubulin appears to be a highly controlled mechanism that regulates microtubule functioning. Acetylation of the ε-amino group of Lys-40 of α-tubulin marks stable microtubules, although the causal relationship between tubulin acetylation and microtubule stability has remained poorly understood. HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. Here, by using tubastatin A, an HDAC6-specific inhibitor, and siRNA-mediated depletion of HDAC6, we have explored whether tubulin acetylation has a role in regulating microtubule stability. We found that whereas both pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 as well as its depletion enhance microtubule acetylation, only pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 activity leads to an increase in microtubule stability against cold and nocodazole-induced depolymerizing conditions. Tubastatin A treatment suppressed the dynamics of individual microtubules in MCF-7 cells and delayed the reassembly of depolymerized microtubules. Interestingly, both the localization of HDAC6 on microtubules and the amount of HDAC6 associated with polymeric fraction of tubulin were found to increase in the tubastatin A-treated cells compared with the control cells, suggesting that the pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 enhances the binding of HDAC6 to microtubules. The evidence presented in this study indicated that the increased binding of HDAC6, rather than the acetylation per se, causes microtubule stability. The results are in support of a hypothesis that in addition to its deacetylase function, HDAC6 might function as a MAP that regulates microtubule dynamics under certain conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2069184106,"Neutrophil chemotaxis requires excitatory signals at the front and inhibitory signals at the back of cells, which regulate cell migration in a chemotactic gradient field. We have previously shown that ATP release via pannexin 1 (PANX1) channels and autocrine stimulation of P2Y2 receptors contribute to the excitatory signals at the front. Here we show that PANX1 also contributes to the inhibitory signals at the back, namely by providing the ligand for A2A adenosine receptors. In resting neutrophils, we found that A2A receptors are uniformly distributed across the cell surface. In polarized cells, A2A receptors redistributed to the back where their stimulation triggered intracellular cAMP accumulation and protein kinase A (PKA) activation, which blocked chemoattractant receptor signaling. Inhibition of PANX1 blocked A2A receptor stimulation and cAMP accumulation in response to formyl peptide receptor stimulation. Treatments that blocked endogenous A2A receptor signaling impaired the polarization and migration of neutrophils in a chemotactic gradient field and resulted in enhanced ERK and p38 MAPK signaling in response to formyl peptide receptor stimulation. These findings suggest that chemoattractant receptors require PANX1 to trigger excitatory and inhibitory signals that synergize to fine-tune chemotactic responses at the front and back of neutrophils. PANX1 channels thus link local excitatory signals to the global inhibitory signals that orchestrate chemotaxis of neutrophils in gradient fields."
https://openalex.org/W1997848849,"Celastrol is a triterpenoid compound extracted from the Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. Previous research has revealed its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and immunosuppressive properties. Here, we investigated whether celastrol inhibits oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) induced oxidative stress in RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, the effect of celastrol on atherosclerosis in vivo was assessed in apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE−/−) mouse fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet (HFC). We found that celastrol significantly attenuated oxLDL-induced excessive expression of lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor-1(LOX-1) and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cultured RAW264.7 macrophages. Celastrol also decreased IκB phosphorylation and degradation and reduced production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nitric oxide (NO) and proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6. Celastrol reduced atherosclerotic plaque size in apoE−/− mice. The expression of LOX-1 within the atherosclerotic lesions and generation of superoxide in mouse aorta were also significantly reduced by celastrol while the lipid profile was not improved. In conclusion, our results show that celastrol inhibits atherosclerotic plaque developing in apoE−/− mice via inhibiting LOX-1 and oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W1979427314,"The identification of additional prognostic markers to improve risk stratification and to avoid overtreatment is one of the most urgent clinical needs in prostate cancer (PCa). MicroRNAs, being important regulators of gene expression, are promising biomarkers in various cancer entities, though the impact as prognostic predictors in PCa is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify specific miRNAs as potential prognostic markers in high-risk PCa and to validate their clinical impact.We performed miRNA-microarray analysis in a high-risk PCa study group selected by their clinical outcome (clinical progression free survival (CPFS) vs. clinical failure (CF)). We identified seven candidate miRNAs (let-7a/b/c, miR-515-3p/5p, -181b, -146b, and -361) that showed differential expression between both groups. Further qRT-PCR analysis revealed down-regulation of members of the let-7 family in the majority of a large, well-characterized high-risk PCa cohort (n = 98). Expression of let-7a/b/and -c was correlated to clinical outcome parameters of this group. While let-7a showed no association or correlation with clinical relevant data, let-7b and let-7c were associated with CF in PCa patients and functioned partially as independent prognostic marker. Validation of the data using an independent high-risk study cohort revealed that let-7b, but not let-7c, has impact as an independent prognostic marker for BCR and CF. Furthermore, we identified HMGA1, a non-histone protein, as a new target of let-7b and found correlation of let-7b down-regulation with HMGA1 over-expression in primary PCa samples.Our findings define a distinct miRNA expression profile in PCa cases with early CF and identified let-7b as prognostic biomarker in high-risk PCa. This study highlights the importance of let-7b as tumor suppressor miRNA in high-risk PCa and presents a basis to improve individual therapy for high-risk PCa patients."
https://openalex.org/W1997470856,"Nearly 30% of the approximately 700,000 military personnel who served in Operation Desert Storm (1990-1991) have developed Gulf War Illness, a condition that presents with symptoms such as cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, debilitating fatigue and chronic widespread pain that implicate the central nervous system. A hallmark complaint of subjects with Gulf War Illness is post-exertional malaise; defined as an exacerbation of symptoms following physical and/or mental effort. To study the causal relationship between exercise, the brain, and changes in symptoms, 28 Gulf War veterans and 10 controls completed an fMRI scan before and after two exercise stress tests to investigate serial changes in pain, autonomic function, and working memory. Exercise induced two clinical Gulf War Illness subgroups. One subgroup presented with orthostatic tachycardia (n = 10). This phenotype correlated with brainstem atrophy, baseline working memory compensation in the cerebellar vermis, and subsequent loss of compensation after exercise. The other subgroup developed exercise induced hyperalgesia (n = 18) that was associated with cortical atrophy and baseline working memory compensation in the basal ganglia. Alterations in cognition, brain structure, and symptoms were absent in controls. Our novel findings may provide an understanding of the relationship between the brain and post-exertional malaise in Gulf War Illness."
https://openalex.org/W2170232981,"Arp2/3 is a protein complex that nucleates actin filament assembly in the lamellipodium in adherent cells crawling on planar 2-dimensional (2D) substrates. However, in physiopathological situations, cell migration typically occurs within a 3-dimensional (3D) environment, and little is known about the role of Arp2/3 and associated proteins in 3D cell migration. Using time resolved live-cell imaging and HT1080, a fibrosarcoma cell line commonly used to study cell migration, we find that the Arp2/3 complex and associated proteins N-WASP, WAVE1, cortactin, and Cdc42 regulate 3D cell migration. We report that this regulation is caused by formation of multigeneration dendritic protrusions, which mediate traction forces on the surrounding matrix and effective cell migration. The primary protrusions emanating directly from the cell body and prolonging the nucleus forms independent of Arp2/3 and dependent on focal adhesion proteins FAK, talin, and p130Cas. The Arp2/3 complex, N-WASP, WAVE1, cortactin, and Cdc42 regulate the secondary protrusions branching off from the primary protrusions. In 3D matrices, fibrosarcoma cells as well as migrating breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancer cells do not display lamellipodial structures. This study characterizes the unique topology of protrusions made by cells in a 3D matrix and show that these dendritic protrusions play a critical role in 3D cell motility and matrix deformation. The relative contribution of these proteins to 3D migration is significantly different from their role in 2D migration."
https://openalex.org/W2023336267,"The CXCR4 chemokine receptor promotes survival of many different cell types. Here, we describe a previously unsuspected role for CXCR4 as a potent inducer of apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and a subset of clinical AML samples. We show that SDF-1, the sole ligand for CXCR4, induces the expected migration and ERK activation in the KG1a AML cell line transiently overexpressing CXCR4, but ERK activation did not lead to survival. Instead, SDF-1 treatment led via a CXCR4-dependent mechanism to apoptosis, as evidenced by increased annexin V staining, condensation of chromatin, and cleavage of both procaspase-3 and PARP. This SDF-1-induced death pathway was partially inhibited by hypoxia, which is often found in the bone marrow of AML patients. SDF-1-induced apoptosis was inhibited by dominant negative procaspase-9 but not by inhibition of caspase-8 activation, implicating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Further analysis showed that this pathway was activated by multiple mechanisms, including up-regulation of Bak at the level of mRNA and protein, stabilization of the Bak activator Noxa, and down-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-XL. Furthermore, adjusting expression levels of Bak, Bcl-XL, or Noxa individually altered the level of apoptosis in AML cells, suggesting that the combined modulation of these family members by SDF-1 coordinates their interplay to produce apoptosis. Thus, rather than mediating survival, SDF-1 may be a means to induce apoptosis of CXCR4-expressing AML cells directly in the SDF-1-rich bone marrow microenvironment if the survival cues of the bone marrow are disrupted.Background: The chemokine receptor CXCR4 plays a role in AML.Results: SDF-1, the ligand of CXCR4, induces apoptosis in AML cell lines and patient samples via modulation of Bcl-2 family members.Conclusion: SDF-1 induces apoptosis of AML cells via up-regulation of Bak and Noxa and down-regulation of Bcl-XL.Significance: SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling could induce AML cell apoptosis if bone marrow survival cues can be disrupted.

Both the endosteal and vascular niches provide an environment that supports normal hematopoietic stem cells as well as leukemic stem cells. A variety of cytokines, chemokines, and integrins present in these niches mediate both the homing and survival signals necessary to propagate leukemia. In addition, the expansion of hypoxic areas during the development of leukemia leads to additional signals that support the proliferation and survival of AML cells (1.Doan P.L. Chute J.P.

Determining which of these signaling events are critical for the survival of AML cells will help to identify a strategy to disrupt the protection that the bone marrow microenvironment provides for AML cells. CXCR4 is a G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor that signals in response to its sole physiological ligand, SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor-1; also known as CXCL12). CXCR4 has been characterized as a key player in the development of AML due to the abundant expression of SDF-1 within the bone marrow microenvironment. CXCR4 expression is essential for enabling AML cells to home to the bone marrow (1.Doan P.L. Chute J.P. The vascular niche.

Previous studies have suggested that CXCR4 can activate death signaling via either the extrinsic or intrinsic pathway. The extrinsic pathway is triggered when ligands on initiator cells bind to death receptors on target cells, leading to caspase-8 activation and downstream apoptotic events in those target cells. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is activated by changes that tip the balance between anti- and proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. Upon activation, the effector members of this family, Bak and Bax, oligomerize and permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane, resulting in the release of cytochrome c, activation of procaspase-9, and subsequent caspase-mediated cleavages. The effectors are in turn regulated by the two other classes of Bcl-2 family members. The BH3-only-containing proapoptotic members, which include Bim, Puma, Bid, and Noxa, promote apoptosis by directly binding and inducing the oligomerizaton of Bak and/or Bax or by neutralizing the antiapoptotic members. The antiapoptotic family members directly bind and antagonize Bak and Bax or sequester the BH3-only family members to prevent interactions with the effectors (17.Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C.

Many studies analyzing the role of CXCR4 in AML have focused on inhibiting CXCR4 signaling by utilizing AMD3100 or other CXCR4 antagonists. Based on these prior studies, we set out to determine the signaling mechanisms involved in SDF-1-mediated survival of AML cells. However, we found that SDF-1 did not promote AML cell survival but instead induced apoptosis of AML cells expressing CXCR4. Here, we characterize a novel SDF-1-mediated apoptosis pathway in AML cells and provide evidence suggesting that this intrinsic apoptotic mechanism is normally suppressed within the bone marrow microenvironment. These results describe a new role for SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling in AML cells and indicate that SDF-1/CXCR4 functions in AML are more complex than previously appreciated.

Following sedimentation on a Ficoll-Paque (1.077 g/cm3) step gradient (24.English D. Andersen B.R. Single-step separation of red blood cells. Granulocytes and mononuclear leukocytes on discontinuous density gradients of Ficoll-Hypaque.J. Immunol.

The AML cell lines, KG1a and U937, and the E6 Jurkat acute T cell leukemia line (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS at a cell density of 0.6–1.0 million cells/ml. HeLa cells (ATCC) were cultured to confluence in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS. To generate CXCR4-expressing KG1a, U937, and E6 Jurkat cells, we transiently transfected cells with a plasmid encoding a CXCR4-YFP fluorescent fusion protein (25.Kumar A. Humphreys T.D. Kremer K.N.

The transfection efficiencies of KG1a and U937 with control YFP empty vector were typically 10–20% and 10–15%, respectively. The E6 Jurkat T cell line was transfected as described previously (25.Kumar A. Humphreys T.D. Kremer K.N. Bramati P.S. Bradfield L. Edgar C.E. Hedin K.E.

Flow cytometric data were gated to compare cells expressing similar levels of YFP. To stably suppress either Bak or Bim protein expression, KG1a cells were transduced with lentiviral particles that target the sequence CCCATTCACTACAGGTGAA for Bak or GACCGAGAAGGTAGACAATTGC for Bim in pSIH-H1, respectively (26.Kepp O.

Following transfection of plasmids encoding shRNA or empty vector into HEK293 cells along with the packaging plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.G, supernatants were collected and filtered through 0.45-μm filters. After viral infection on two successive days, KG1a cells were cultured in medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin for a week. Bak- and Bim-specific antibodies were used to assay Bak and Bim expression via Western blot. To transiently suppress Noxa, Bak, or Bim protein expression, KG1a or Jurkat cells were transiently transfected as indicated above with the following siRNAs from Ambion (Austin, TX): Control siRNA (Silencer® Negative Control 1); Noxa siRNA (sense, 5′-GGAGAUUUGGAGACAAACUTT-3′; antisense, 5′-AGUUUGUCUCCAAAUCUCCTG-3′); Bak siRNA (sense, GUACGAAGAUUCUUCAAAUTT; antisense, AUUUGAAGAAUCUUCGUACCA); and Bim siRNA (sense, 5′-GACCGAGAAGGUAGACAAUTT-3′; antisense, 5′-AUUGUCUACCUUCUCGGUCTT-3′). The cells were cultured for 6–7 h prior to the addition of SDF-1. Depletion of Noxa, Bak, and Bim was confirmed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies using lysates prepared 24 h after transfection. Tert-immortalized bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSC) were a kind gift of Dario Campana (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) (28.Iwamoto S. Mihara K. Downing J.R. Pui C.H.

For assaying total cellular CXCR4 levels, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in BD Phosflow Lyse/Fix buffer; sedimented; permeabilized on ice for 30 min with BD Perm Buffer III; washed with BD stain buffer (BD Biosciences); stained with either CXCR4 mAb or a control, anti-EGFR mAb, for 30 min at room temperature; and assayed by flow cytometry. Where indicated, the KG1a cells were treated with 5 × 10−8 m SDF-1 for 20 min prior to staining for CXCR4. KG1a cells were transfected with either CXCR4-YFP or YFP empty vector and cultured for 18 h prior to the migration assay or ERK activation assay. For the migration assay, the cells were stained with calcein-AM and assayed for migration as described (31.Kremer K.N. Clift I.C. Miamen A.G. Bamidele A.O. Qian N.X. Humphreys T.D. Hedin K.E.

Where indicated, either 10 μm PD325901, 10 μm CI-1040, or DMSO (vehicle) was added 16–18 h prior to the addition of SDF-1, or either 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin or its control toxin was added 4 h prior to the addition of SDF-1. For analysis of active phospho-ERK, cells were stimulated ± 5 × 10−8 m SDF-1 and assayed by flow cytometry (31.Kremer K.N. Clift I.C. Miamen A.G. Bamidele A.O. Qian N.X. Humphreys T.D. Hedin K.E.

For assays measuring apoptosis, the indicated cells were cultured at 0.25 × 106 cells/ml in the presence or absence of 1.3 × 10−8 m SDF-1 or 6 ng/ml CH.11 agonistic anti-Fas antibody (Millipore) for 16–18 h and then assayed for apoptosis using one of the techniques listed below. Where indicated, 30 μm AMD3100, 1 μm CCX704, 1 μm CCX771, 10 μm PD325901, 10 μm CI-1040 was added 1 h prior to the addition of SDF-1; 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin or its control toxin was added 4 h prior to the addition of SDF-1; cells were placed in a hypoxia chamber at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 1% O2 for 16–18 h prior to the annexin V staining; cells were incubated for 2 h under hypoxic or normoxic conditions and then treated with 1 μm cytarabine for 16–18 h in the indicated oxygen conditions; cells were cotransfected with CXCR4-YFP and a plasmid encoding the viral c-FLIP homolog MC159 (a kind gift from Greg Gores, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN), a dominant-negative caspase-9/EGFP fusion protein (obtained from Emad Alnemri, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA), or human Noxa with L29A and D34A mutations (Noxa-2A) (32.Dai H.

To detect fragmented nuclei, cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in 3:1 methanol/acetic acid, incubated at room temperature for 1 h, centrifuged, and mounted in 50% glycerol, 50% 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (34.Meng X.W.

Cleaved PARP and active caspase-3 were assayed by flow microfluorimetry in YFP-positive cells using an Alexafluor-647-conjugated antibody to cleaved PARP and an active caspase-3 apoptosis kit, respectively, according to the suppliers' instructions. AML isolates were cultured in Medium A for 1–2 h prior to plating on BMSC. The isolates were plated at a density of 0.25 × 106 cells/ml onto a confluent layer of BMSC for 1 h, and then 5 × 10−8 m SDF-1 was added for 16–18 h in Medium A. Annexin V staining was performed as described above. For the quantitative RT-PCR and the immunoblots of Bcl-2 family members, KG1a cells were transfected with CXCR4-YFP, treated with 5 μm Q-VD-OPh, cultured for 16–18 h ± SDF-1, and then sorted for the brightest 12% of YFP-expressing cells. The quantitative RT-PCR was performed in triplicate using 100 ng of RNA and TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) per the supplier's instructions.

For detection of protein levels of the Bcl-2 family members by Western blot, the sorted cells were sedimented at 200 × g for 10 min, washed once with ice-cold RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 at 4 °C), and prepared for electrophoresis as described (36.Kaufmann S.H.

KG1a cells were cotransfected with CXCR4-YFP and Noxa2A-GFP; cultured for 16 h with the caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh in the presence or absence of SDF-1; and then treated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide for the indicated time, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and analyzed via flow microfluorimetry for Noxa2A-GFP expression in gated CXCR4-YFP-positive cells. The amount of Noxa2A-GFP remaining after the indicated cycloheximide treatment was determined as a percentage of the Noxa2A-GFP present at the 0 h time point. In initial experiments, we observed that CXCR4 is expressed at varying levels on the cell surface of primary AML cells from patient bone marrow (Fig. 1A). We also confirmed that CXCR4 is expressed intracellularly in patient samples, as indicated by the increased signal observed upon permeabilizing the plasma membrane prior to CXCR4 staining (Fig. 1B). Patient data shown in Fig. 1, A and B, are representative of all patients analyzed during the study period (supplemental Table 1). These results confirm previous findings that CXCR4 is expressed variably on the cell surface of AML isolates and that CXCR4 is maintained intracellularly at high levels in most AML isolates (9.Tavor S.

The present study showed that elevated serum concentration of IL-6 is associated with decreased levels of miR-200s, impaired activation of the AKT/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) pathway, and reduced glycogenesis that occurred in the livers of db/db mice.

Moreover, IL-6 treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT and GSK and decreased the glycogenesis. The effects of IL-6 could be diminished by suppression of FOG2 expression.

Insulin resistance, defined as a diminished ability of cells, such as adipocytes, skeletal muscle cells, and hepatocytes, to respond to the action of insulin, plays a central role in the development of several metabolic abnormalities and diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome (1.Petersen K.F.

Underlying mechanisms of insulin resistance in the hepatocytes include decreased glycogen synthesis and failure to suppress glucose production (3.Leclercq I.A. Da Silva Morais A. Schroyen B.

Hepatol. 2007; 47: 142-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). IL-6 has been recognized as an important mediator of insulin resistance by impairing the insulin signaling pathway. It has been well demonstrated that IL-6 may lead to block the PI3K/AKT pathway (4.Allen T.L. Febbraio M.A. IL6 as a mediator of insulin resistance. Fat or fiction?.Diabetologia. 2010; 53: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Moreover, both in vitro evidence and in vivo observations suggest that elevated levels of IL-6 selectively induce insulin resistance in the liver, whereas systemic depletion of IL-6 improves hepatic insulin action in an obese mouse model (5.Klover P.J.

However, molecular mechanisms linking IL-6 to hepatic insulin resistance remained poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) 3The abbreviations used are: miRNA, microRNA; FFA, free fatty acids; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase. are small, noncoding 20–24-nucleotide RNAs that negatively regulate their target gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by binding to specific, partially complementary regions in the 3′-UTR of the target mRNAs (8.Bartel D.P.

Recent studies have shown the involvement of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. For instance, miR-375, miR-29, miR-9, and Let-7 could regulate insulin secretion (9.Frost R.J. Olson E.N.

The miR-200 family, including miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, and miR-429, is highly conserved in the bilateral animals and up-regulated in the endometrial carcinoma (21.Snowdon J. Zhang X.

However, the role of miR-200s in the development of hepatic insulin resistance has not been reported. The present study identified a group of miRNAs (e.g. miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-200c (so-called miR-200s)) that contribute to IL-6-induced insulin resistance in the hepatocytes. For the first time, this study has discovered new experimental evidence that IL-6 impairs the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and the synthesis of glycogen via down-regulating miR-200s, accompanied by up-regulating the expression of FOG2. We obtained db/db mice (C57BL/KsJ) from the Peking University Health Science Center (originally purchased form Jackson Laboratory). Briefly, db/db mice (n = 5) and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice (n = 5) were fed a standard laboratory diet for 12 weeks. 12-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were provided from the Peking University Health Science Center. The mice (n = 10) were separated into two groups and fed a standard laboratory diet. For all experiments examining chronic IL-6 exposure, Alzet osmotic pumps (Durect, Cupertino, CA) with a 7-day pumping capacity and infusion rate of 1 μl/h were used. Pumps were filled to capacity with 16 μg/ml hIL-6 diluted in carrier (0.9% NaCl and 0.1% BSA) (6.Klover P.J. Zimmers T.A. Koniaris L.G. Mooney R.A. Chronic exposure to interleukin-6 causes hepatic insulin resistance in mice.Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2784-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Following induction of the halothane general anesthesia, pumps were implanted into the intrascapular subcutaneous space. Incisions were closed with interrupted absorbable sutures. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Use Guidelines. All animal protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee at the Beijing Institute of Geriatrics. To profile the expression of miRNAs between two groups of mice, the miRNAs in the liver samples from five db/db mice and five control mice were analyzed by the miRCURYLNA Array (version 14.0) system. Total RNA was harvested using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The samples were labeled using the miRCURYTMHy3TM/Hy5TM Power labeling kit and hybridized on the miRCURYTM LNA Array (version 14.0). Scanning was performed with an Axon GenePix 400B microarray scanner. GenePix pro version 6.0 was used to read image raw intensity. The levels of serum FFA, glucose, and IL-6 were examined using a kit from Sigma. NCTC 1469 cells derived from mouse liver cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% O2, 5% CO2. Male C57BL/6J mice (12 weeks old) were provided from the Peking University Health Science Center. Primary hepatocytes were isolated by a two-step collagenase perfusion (0.2 mg/ml type IV collagenase (Sigma) in Hanks' balanced salt solution), as described previously (23.Ulvila J. Arpiainen S. Pelkonen O. Aida K. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Hakkola J. Regulation of Cyp2a5 transcription in mouse primary hepatocytes. Roles of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 and nuclear factor I.Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The hepatocytes were collected by centrifugation at 800 rpm for 8 min. Immediately after harvesting, the cells were suspended in prewarmed William's E medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 ng/ml dexamethasone (Sigma), ITS (5 mg/liter insulin, 5 mg/liter transferrin, 5 μg/liter sodium selenate) (Sigma), and 10 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen). The hepatocytes were plated in collagen-coated 25-cm2 flasks at 1 × 106 cells/flask. The mimics and inhibitors of miR-200s were purchased from Genepharm. The miRNA mimic control and inhibitor control were used as negative controls. Hiperfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) was used for the transfection of miR-200 mimics and inhibitors. 48 h after transfection, the expression of miR-200s was detected by real-time PCR. Enriched miRNA was isolated using an miRNA isolation kit (TaKaRa). A stem-loop reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was also executed on samples to detect and quantify mature miRNAs by using stem-loop antisense primer mix and avian myeloblastosis virus transcriptase (TaKaRa). The cDNA preparations were routinely tested by real-time PCR based on the SYBR Green I method, according to the manufacturer's instructions (TaKaRa). The amplification and detection of specific products were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with the ABI PRISM 7500 system (Applied Biosystems). The U6 small nucleolar RNA was used as the housekeeping small RNA reference gene. The relative gene expression was normalized to U6 small nucleolar RNA. Each reaction was performed in triplicate, and analysis was performed by the 2−ΔΔCT method. Nucleotide primers used for reverse transcription were as follows (5′-3′): miR-200a, GTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGACACATCG; miR-200b, GTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGACTCATCA; miR-200c, GTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGACTCCATC; U6, GTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGACAAAATATG. The nucleotide primers used for real-time PCR were as follows (5′-3′): miR-200a forward, GCTAACACTGTCTGGTAACGATGT; miR-200b forward, GCGTAATACTGCCTGGTAATGATG; miR-200c forward, GTAATACTGCCGGGTAATGATGGA; U6 forward, GCGCGTCGTGAAGCGTTC; universal reverse primer, GTGCAGGGTCCGAGGT. Cell lysates (15–30 μg of protein) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore), blocked with 8% nonfat dry milk, and probed with the antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-IgG, followed by detection with ECL (Millipore). The antibodies against AKT, phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473), glycogen synthase kinase (GSK), and phosphorylation of GSK (Ser9) were purchased from Cell Signaling. The antibodies to FOG2 and β-actin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Dallas, TX). The glycogen levels were measured in the cells or liver tissues incubated for 3 h in the presence of 1 nmol/liter insulin (Usbio), using a glycogen assay kit (Biovision). All values are represented as means ± S.E. of the indicated number of measurements. A one-way analysis of variance test was used to determine significance, with values of p < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. The levels of serum glucose and FFA were significantly increased in the db/db mice (Fig. 1A). The concentration of IL-6 in serum was also elevated in the db/db mice (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the glycogen levels in the livers of db/db mice were significantly decreased, demonstrating a state of insulin resistance (Fig. 1C). It is noteworthy that the phosphorylation of AKT and GSK was reduced in the livers of db/db mice, indicating impaired activation of AKT/GSK pathway (Fig. 1D). To examine the expression of the miR-200 family, including miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, and miR-429, in the livers of db/db mice, the miRNAs of the livers of db/db mice (n = 5) and control mice (n = 5) were analyzed by miRNA microarray. The results of the miRNA microarray showed that the levels of miR-200a and miR-200b were decreased, whereas the expression of miR-200c was increased, and there was no difference in the expression of miR-141 and miR-429 (Table 1). The results of the miRNA microarray were verified by real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 1E, the levels of miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-200c were reduced. The result of miR-200c was not consistent with that from the microarray. The microarray was used for genome-wide profiling of miRNAs. However, the results of the miRNA microarray were affected by many factors. Therefore, the results of the microarray need to be further validated by real-time PCR. These in vivo observations suggest that decreased expression of miR-200s probably contributes to hepatic insulin resistance.TABLE 1The results of microRNA microarray analysisForegroundForeground − backgroundNormalizedNameChange (D/C)CDCDCD-foldmiR-200a0.11168.577104110.410.04miR-200b0.48298179.5228.5109.50.900.40miR-200c1.37108.51234156.50.160.22miR-141NAaNA, not available.14261.576.5−100.3NAmiR-429NA67.557−2.5−22NANAa NA, not available. Open table in a new tab These observations in the db/db mice were extended to a cellular model of insulin resistance. Mouse NCTC 1469 hepatocytes were treated with 33.3 mmol/liter glucose for 48 h and 0.25 mmol/liter palmitate for 24 h, respectively, to induce insulin resistance, as described previously (24.Gao D. Nong S. Huang X. Lu Y. Zhao H. Lin Y. Man Y. Wang S. Yang J. Li J. The effects of palmitate on hepatic insulin resistance are mediated by NADPH oxidase 3-derived reactive oxygen species through JNK and p38MAPK pathways.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29965-29973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In addition, NCTC 1469 cells were treated with different concentrations of IL-6 (10, 20, and 40 ng/ml) for different times (12, 24, and 48 h) to induce insulin resistance (data not shown). The treatment of 10 ng/ml IL-6 for 24 h was chosen for the following experiments. The expression of miR-200s was analyzed by real-time PCR. The results showed that IL-6, but not glucose and palmitate, can suppress the expression of miR-200s (Fig. 2, A–C). We also analyzed the effect of glucose and palmitate on the expression of other microRNAs, such as miR-320. Our results showed that the miR-320 level was increased in the NCTC 1469 cells treated with glucose and palmitate for 48 h. Therefore, miR-320 could be used as a positive control in experiments with glucose and palmitate (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, down-regulation of miR-200s by IL-6 was assessed in the exposure of mouse primary hepatocytes to 10 ng/ml IL-6 for 24 h (Fig. 2D). In order to confirm the effect of IL-6 on the expression of miR-200s in vivo, 12-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were injected with 16 μg/ml IL-6 by pumps for 7 days, and the livers of mice were collected. As shown in Fig. 2E, the expression of miR-200s was also significantly decreased in the livers of mice injected with IL-6. Our results suggest that IL-6 could down-regulate the expression of miR-200s in vitro and in vivo. To determine the effect of IL-6 on glycogenesis, NCTC 1469 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes were treated with 10 ng/ml IL-6 for 24 h. The IL-6 treatment significantly decreased the glycogen levels in both NCTC 1469 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, we analyzed the effect of IL-6 on the phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3 in insulin-treated and untreated NCTC1469 cells and primary hepatocytes. In parallel with decreased phosphorylation of AKT, the phosphorylation of GSK was reduced in both NCTC 1469 cells and primary hepatocytes exposed to IL-6 (Fig. 3, A and B). Next, the synthesis of glycogen and the activation of AKT/GSK pathway in the livers of C57BL/6J mice injected with IL-6 were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3C, the levels of glycogen were dramatically decreased, accompanied by impaired phosphorylation of AKT and GSK in the livers of mice injected with IL-6. These results suggest that IL-6 could suppress activation of the AKT/GSK pathway and glycogenesis in the hepatocytes of mice. We tested the notion that miR-200s serve as a link between IL-6 and hepatic insulin resistance. Therefore, we next observed the effect of miR-200s on activation of the AKT/GSK pathway and glycogenesis in the hepatocytes. First, the mimics of miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-200c were transfected into the NCTC 1469 cells for 48 h. The results of real-time PCR showed that the levels of miR-200s were increased to 15–30-fold in the NCTC 1469 cells transfected with the mimics of miR-200s compared with those transfected with the negative miRNA mimic control (Fig. 4A). Moreover, overexpression of miR-200s rescued IL-6-induced suppression of glycogenesis in the NCTC 1469 cells. Second, the inhibitors of miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-200c were transfected into the NCTC 1469 cells for 48 h. The levels of miR-200s were decreased by 20–30% compared with those transfected with negative miRNA inhibitor control (Fig. 4B). Next, we examined the effects of miR-200s on the phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3 in both insulin-treated and -untreated NCTC1469 cells. The results showed that miR-200s could improve insulin sensitivity in both insulin-treated and -untreated NCTC1469 cells (Fig. 4C). Importantly, the transfection of miR-200 mimics could rescue IL-6-induced impaired phosphorylation of AKT and GSK and reduced glycogenesis (Fig. 4D). As shown in Fig. 4E, down-regulation of miR-200s induced impaired activation of AKT and GSK, accompanied by reduced glycogenesis in the NCTC 1469 cells. Taken together, these results suggest miR-200s as a link between IL-6 and hepatic insulin resistance. miR-200s modulate activation of the AKT/GSK pathway and glycogenesis in the hepatocytes. miR-200s was highly conserved in the mammals (Fig. 5A). It has been reported that there are several target sites for the miR-200 family in the 3′-UTR of FOG2, and the miR-200 family down-regulates the expression of FOG2 (22.Hyun S. Lee J.H. Jin H. Nam J. Namkoong B. Lee G. Chung J. Kim V.N. Conserved MicroRNA miR-8/miR-200 and its target USH/FOG2 control growth by regulating PI3K.Cell. 2009; 139: 1096-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To further assess whether FOG2 is regulated by miR-200s, NCTC 1469 cells were transfected with the mimics and inhibitors of miR-200s, respectively. The results showed that the expression of FOG2 was down-regulated in the NCTC 1469 cells transfected with the mimics of miR-200s (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the transfection of NCTC 1469 cells with the inhibitors of miR-200s up-regulated the expression of FOG2 (Fig. 5C). In the present study, we found that the expression of FOG2 was significantly increased in the db/db mice (Fig. 6A). As shown in Fig. 6, B and C, IL-6 increased the levels of FOG2 mRNA and protein in both NCTC 1469 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. Moreover, the levels of FOG2 mRNA and protein were enhanced in the livers of mice injected with IL-6 (Fig. 6D). These observations indicate that FOG2 may be involved in IL-6-induced insulin resistance. To further assess the role of FOG2 in IL-6-induced hepatic insulin resistance, six siRNAs (si-676, si-1341, 3445, si-2530, si-2590, and si-3510) targeting FOG2 mRNA were transfected into the NCTC 1469 cells. Western blot analysis indicated that both si-676-FOG2 and si-3510-FOG2 significantly down-regulated the expression of FOG2 (Fig. 6E). The effects of IL-6 on the phosphorylation of AKT and GSK were rescued by the transfection of si-3510-FOG2 and si-676-FOG2 into the NCTC 1469 cells (Fig. 6, F and G). Furthermore, FOG2 down-regulation reversed IL-6-induced impaired glycogenesis in the NCTC 1469 cells (Fig. 6, F and G). In order to determine whether the inhibitory effect of FOG2 should point toward PI3K pathway, we used PI3K inhibitor LY294002 to block the PI3K pathway in NCTC1469 cells transfected by siRNA-FOG2. The results showed that FOG2 could not affect the glycogenesis after treatment with 10 nm PI3K inhibitor LY294002 for 24 h (Fig. 6H). Taken together, these results suggest that suppression of FOG2 substantially blocked IL-6-induced impaired activation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK pathway and glycogenesis in the hepatocytes. There is increasing evidence that miRNAs play a role in many aspects of insulin resistance and hence may be involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we found that the expression of miR-200s was decreased in the livers of db/db mice, accompanied by an elevated level of IL-6. Because db/db mice are complex and accompanied by other factors, such as elevated levels of serum FFA and glucose, it is difficult to determine the contribution of IL-6 to down-regulation of miR-200s. Therefore, we extended these observations from db/db mice to a mouse hepatocyte cell line, NCTC 1469. The results show that the treatment of 10 ng/ml IL-6 for 24 h suppressed the expression of miR-200s, whereas there was no change in the expression of miR-200s in the NCTC 1469 cells treated with either 33.3 mmol/liter glucose or 0.25 mmol/liter palmitate. Similarly, down-regulation of miR-200s by IL-6 was assessed in the mouse primary hepatocytes exposed to 10 ng/ml IL-6 for 24 h and in the livers of C57BL/6J mice injected with IL-6. Moreover, we found that IL-6 suppressed the expression of miR-200s, accompanied by down-regulation of miR-152 in the NCTC 1469 hepatocytes and the primary hepatocytes treated with 10 ng/ml IL-6 for 24 h and in 12-week-old male C57BL/6J mice injected with 16 μg/ml IL-6 by pumps for 7 days. Importantly, the transfection by miR-152 inhibitor led to reduced expression of miR-200s in the NCTC 1469 hepatocytes, suggesting that miR-152 could regulate miR-200 expression (data not shown). Our study demonstrates for the first time that IL-6 suppresses the expression of miR-200s in hepatocytes. Accordingly, it has been proposed that IL-6 contributes to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes (4.Allen T.L. Febbraio M.A. IL6 as a mediator of insulin resistance. Fat or fiction?.Diabetologia. 2010; 53: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Both in vitro evidence and in vivo observations suggest that elevated levels of IL-6 selectively induce insulin resistance in the liver, whereas systemic depletion of IL-6 improves hepatic insulin action in an obese mouse model (5.Klover P.J. Clementi A.H. Mooney R.A. Interleukin-6 depletion selectively improves hepatic insulin action in obesity.Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3417-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 6.Klover P.J.

Bachmann R.A. Chen J. Interleukin-6 and insulin resistance.Vitam. Horm. 2009; 80: 613-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In the liver, insulin activates the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade, leading to the phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK. Hence, glycogen synthase, the target of GSK, is freed of inhibitory phosphorylation, and glycogen synthesis is induced upon insulin stimulation (25.Oh Y.S. Lee Y.J. Park E.Y. Jun H.S. Interleukin-6 treatment induces beta-cell apoptosis via STAT-3-mediated nitric oxide production.Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2011; 27: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In our study, we found that the levels of phosphorylation of AKT and GSK were reduced in both NCTC 1469 cells and primary hepatocytes exposed to 10 ng/ml IL-6 for 24 h. Similarly, the levels of glycogen were dramatically decreased, accompanied by impaired phosphorylation of AKT and GSK in the livers of mice injected with IL-6. These results suggest that IL-6 induces hepatic insulin resistance by suppression of the AKT/GSK pathway. What is the link between IL-6 and hepatic insulin resistance? Accumulating evidence has suggested that miRNAs are involved in glucose and fat uptake in the livers of type 2 diabetes individuals (26.David M. Interferons and microRNAs.J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2010; 30: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A previous study showed that miR-200s promote cell proliferation in human cell lines. The mice lacking the miR-200 family, including miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, and miR-429, display reduced body size, indicating that miR-200s control growth by regulating PI3K (22.Hyun S.

Moreover, it is reported that miR-200s are expressed in various adult organs, including liver, pancreatic islet, testes, prostate, and ovary (27.Landgraf P. Rusu M. Sheridan R. Sewer A. Iovino N. Aravin A. Pfeffer S. Rice A. Kamphorst A.O. Landthaler M. Lin C. Socci N.D. Hermida L. Fulci V. Chiaretti S. Foà R. Schliwka J. Fuchs U. Novosel A. Müller R.U. Schermer B. Bissels U. Inman J. Phan Q.

A mammalian microRNA expression atlas based on small RNA library sequencing.Cell. 2007; 129: 1401-1414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3019) Google Scholar). Recently, Reddy et al. (28.Reddy M.A. Jin W. Villeneuve L. Wang M. Lanting L. Todorov I. Kato M. Natarajan R. Pro-inflammatory role of microrna-200 in vascular smooth muscle cells from diabetic mice.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2012; 32: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) reported the proinflammatory role of miR-200 in vascular smooth muscle cells from diabetic mice. However, the role of miR-200s in the development of hepatic insulin resistance has not been reported to date. In the present study, we found impaired activity of the PI3K/AKT pathway and a reduced level of glycogen, accompanied by decreased expression of miR-200s in the lever and elevated concentration of IL-6 in serum of db/db mice. We transfected the mimics and inhibitors of miR-200s into the NCTC 1469 cells to further investigate the role of miR-200s in IL-6-induced insulin resistance. Our results suggest miR-200s as a link between IL-6 and hepatic insulin resistance. miR-200s can modulate the activation of the AKT/GSK pathway and the glycogenesis in the hepatocytes. Next, we looked for a correlation between the expression of FOG2 and miR-200s in hepatic insulin resistance. FOG2 is expressed in many tissues, such as liver, heart, brain, testes, lung, and skeletal muscle. Despite its relatively broad expression in adult tissues, little is known about the function of FOG2 beyond its role in embryonic heart development. Previous studies suggested that FOG2 may function as either transcriptional coactivators or corepressors by partnering with various GATA transcription factors. FOG2 is involved in the control of adipocyte proliferation and differentiation (29.Jack B.H. Crossley M. GATA proteins work together with friend of GATA (FOG) and C-terminal binding protein (CTBP) co-regulators to control adipogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32405-32414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). FOG2 also acts as a negative modulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Hyun et al. (22.Hyun S. Lee J.H. Jin H. Nam J. Namkoong B. Lee G. Chung J. Kim V.N. Conserved MicroRNA miR-8/miR-200 and its target USH/FOG2 control growth by regulating PI3K.Cell. 2009; 139: 1096-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) found that FOG2 binds p85α, a regulatory subunit of PI3K, thereby inhibiting formation of the IRS-1/p85α/p110 complex and, consequently, PI3K activation. Moreover, FOG2 has at least three predicted sites for miR-200s. These predicted sites in the 3′-UTR of FOG2 are therefore responsible for miR-200-mediated FOG2 regulation. In the present study, we found that there is generally a negative correlation between miR-200s and FOG2 in the livers of db/db mice and C57BL/6J mice injected with IL-6 and in both NCTC 1469 cells and primary hepatocytes exposed to IL-6, consistent with a suppressive role for miR-200 in FOG2 regulation. We next sought to confirm the repression of FOG2 by miR-200s. The transfection of miR-200 mimics significantly reduced the levels of FOG2, whereas miR-200 inhibitors increased the expression of FOG2 in the NCTC 1469 cells. These data demonstrate that FOG2 is an authentic target of endogenous miR-200s. To further assess the role of FOG2 in IL-6-induced hepatic insulin resistance, siRNA targeting FOG2 mRNA was transfected into the NCTC 1469 cells. The results show that the effects of IL-6 on the phosphorylation of AKT and GSK were rescued by transfection of siRNA-FOG2 into the NCTC 1469 cells. FOG2 down-regulation reversed IL-6-induced impaired glycogenesis in the NCTC 1469 cells. Furthermore, FOG2 could not affect the glycogenesis after treatment with PI3K inhibitor LY294002. These results suggest that FOG2 regulated glycogenesis through the PI3K pathway. Our results show that overexpression of miR-200s and FOG2 knockdown could improve glycogenesis in the NCTC1469 cells. However, in the present study, we did not investigate the effects of miR-200 overexpression and FOG2 knockdown in the livers of db/db mice or FOG2 overexpression in the normal mice on glucose metabolism. It is a limitation in the present study. In conclusion, as shown in Fig. 7, this study provides novel data to show that miR-200s contribute to hepatic insulin resistance induced by IL-6. Our study suggests that IL-6 impairs the activation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK pathway and the synthesis of glycogen via down-regulation of miR-200s, accompanied by up-regulation of the expression of FOG2. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the effects of miR-200 on the regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and the synthesis of glycogen in hepatocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2135165577,"Light information is transmitted to the central clock of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) for daily synchronization to the external solar cycle. Essential for synchronization is the capacity of SCN neurons to respond in a sustained and irradiance-dependent manner to light. Melanopsin has been considered to mediate this photosensory task of irradiance detection. By contrast, the contribution of the classical photoreceptors in irradiance encoding is less clear. Here we investigate the role of classical photoreceptors by in vivo electrophysiological responses in freely moving animals to specific wavelengths of light (UV, λmax 365 nm; blue, λmax 467 nm; and green, λmax 505 nm) in both melanopsin-deficient (Opn4–/–) mice and mice lacking rods and cones (rd/rd cl). Short- and long-wavelength light induced sustained irradiance-dependent responses in congenic wild-type mice (+19.6%). Unexpectedly, sustained responses to light persisted in Opn4–/– mice (+18.4%). These results provide unambiguous evidence that classical photoreceptors can transmit irradiance information to the SCN. In addition, at light intensities that would stimulate rod and cone photoreceptors, the SCN of rd/rd cl mice showed greatly reduced sustained responses to light (+7.8%). Collectively, our data demonstrate a role for classical photoreceptors in illuminance detection by the SCN.—van Diepen, H. C., Ramkisoensing, A., Peirson, S. N., Foster, R. G., Meijer, J.

Proteomic and biochemical techniques were used to determine whether the function of cotyledon and root is altered in soybean under flooding stress. Results Two-day-old soybean plants were flooded for 2 days, after which the proteins from root and cotyledon were extracted for proteomic analysis. In response to flooding stress, the abundance of 73 and 28 proteins was significantly altered in the root and cotyledon, respectively. The accumulation of only one protein, 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) (Glyma17g08020.1), increased in both organs following flooding. The ratio of protein abundance of HSP70 and biophoton emission in the cotyledon was higher than those detected in the root under flooding stress. Computed tomography and elemental analyses revealed that flooding stress decreases the number of calcium oxalate crystal the cotyledon, indicating calcium ion was elevated in the cotyledon under flooding stress. Conclusion These results suggest that calcium might play one role through HSP70 in the cotyledon under flooding stress."

Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of receipt of IPTp and ITN use during pregnancy.Among 89% of recently pregnant women who attended ANC at least once between 4-9 months gestation, 59% reported receiving one dose of SP and 90% attended ANC again, of whom 57% received a second dose, resulting in a cumulative effectiveness for IPTp of 27%, most of whom used an ITN (96%). Overall ITN use was 89%, and ANC the main source (76%). Women were less likely to receive IPTp if they had low malaria knowledge (0.26, 95% CI 0.08-0.83), had a child who had died (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14-0.95), or if they first attended ANC late (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06-0.67). Women who experienced side effects to SP (OR 0.18, CI 0.03-0.90) or had low malaria knowledge (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.11-5.43) were less likely to receive IPTp by directly observed therapy. Ineffective delivery of IPTp reduced its potential impact by 231 LBW cases averted (95% CI 64-359) per 10,000 pregnant women.IPTp presents greater challenges to deliver through ANC than ITNs in this setting. The reduction in public health impact on LBW resulting from ineffective delivery of IPTp is estimated to be substantial. Urgent efforts are required to improve service delivery of this important intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2046546076,"In mammalian skeletal muscle, Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through the ryanodine receptor/Ca(2+)-release channel RyR1 can be enhanced by S-oxidation or S-nitrosylation of separate Cys residues, which are allosterically linked. S-Oxidation of RyR1 is coupled to muscle oxygen tension (pO2) through O2-dependent production of hydrogen peroxide by SR-resident NADPH oxidase 4. In isolated SR (SR vesicles), an average of six to eight Cys thiols/RyR1 monomer are reversibly oxidized at high (21% O2) versus low pO2 (1% O2), but their identity among the 100 Cys residues/RyR1 monomer is unknown. Here we use isotope-coded affinity tag labeling and mass spectrometry (yielding 93% coverage of RyR1 Cys residues) to identify 13 Cys residues subject to pO2-coupled S-oxidation in SR vesicles. Eight additional Cys residues are oxidized at high versus low pO2 only when NADPH levels are supplemented to enhance NADPH oxidase 4 activity. pO2-sensitive Cys residues were largely non-overlapping with those identified previously as hyperreactive by administration of exogenous reagents (three of 21) or as S-nitrosylated. Cys residues subject to pO2-coupled oxidation are distributed widely within the cytoplasmic domain of RyR1 in multiple functional domains implicated in RyR1 activity-regulating interactions with the L-type Ca(2+) channel (dihydropyridine receptor) and FK506-binding protein 12 as well as in ""hot spot"" regions containing sites of mutation implicated in malignant hyperthermia and central core disease. pO2-coupled disulfide formation was identified, whereas neither S-glutathionylated nor sulfenamide-modified Cys residues were observed. Thus, physiological redox regulation of RyR1 by endogenously generated hydrogen peroxide is exerted through dynamic disulfide formation involving multiple Cys residues."
https://openalex.org/W2103243423,"Herein, we performed microarray experiments in Schwann cells infected with live M. leprae and identified novel differentially expressed genes (DEG) in M. leprae infected cells. Also, we selected candidate genes associated or implicated with leprosy in genetic studies and biological experiments. Forty-seven genes were selected for validation in two independent types of samples by multiplex qPCR. First, an in vitro model using THP-1 cells was infected with live Mycobacterium leprae and M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). In a second situation, mRNA obtained from nerve biopsies from patients with leprosy or other peripheral neuropathies was tested. We detected DEGs that discriminate M. bovis BCG from M. leprae infection. Specific signatures of susceptible responses after M. leprae infection when compared to BCG lead to repression of genes, including CCL2, CCL3, IL8 and SOD2. The same 47-gene set was screened in nerve biopsies, which corroborated the down-regulation of CCL2 and CCL3 in leprosy, but also evidenced the down-regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, and the up-regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and ubiquitination. Finally, a gene expression signature from DEG was identified in patients confirmed of having leprosy. A classification tree was able to ascertain 80% of the cases as leprosy or non-leprous peripheral neuropathy based on the expression of only LDLR and CCL4. A general immune and mitochondrial hypo-responsive state occurs in response to M. leprae infection. Also, the most important genes and pathways have been highlighted providing new tools for early diagnosis and treatment of leprosy."

An experiment was conducted to investigate the level of expression of various genes in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway to analyze in vitro production of anthocyanin and phenolic compounds from hairy root cultures derived from 2 cultivars of tartary buckwheat (Hokkai T8 and T10). A total of 47 metabolites were identified by gas chromatography–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) and subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) in order to fully distinguish between Hokkai T8 and T10 hairy roots. The expression levels of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway genes, through qRT-PCR, showed higher expression for almost all the genes in T10 than T8 hairy root except for FtF3’H-2 and FtFLS-2. Rutin, quercetin, gallic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 2 anthocyanin compounds were identified in Hokkai T8 and T10 hairy roots. The concentration of rutin and anthocyanin in Hokkai T10 hairy roots of tartary buckwheat was several-fold higher compared with that obtained from Hokkai T8 hairy root. This study provides useful information on the molecular and physiological dynamic processes that are correlated with phenylpropanoid biosynthetic gene expression and phenolic compound content in F. tataricum species."

https://openalex.org/W2164543908,"It is well known that α1,6-fucosyltransferase (Fut8) and its products, α1,6-fucosylated N-glycans, are highly expressed in brain tissue. Recently, we reported that Fut8-knockout mice exhibited multiple behavioral abnormalities with a schizophrenia-like phenotype, suggesting that α1,6-fucosylation plays important roles in the brain and neuron system. In the present study, we screened several neural cell lines and found that PC12 cells express the highest levels of α1,6-fucosylation. The knockdown (KD) of Fut8 promoted a significant enhancement of neurite formation and induction of neurofilament expression. Surprisingly, the levels of phospho-Smad2 were greatly increased in the KD cells. Finally, we found that the activin-mediated signal pathway was essential for these changes in KD cells. Exogenous activin, not TGF-β1, induced neurite outgrowth and phospho-Smad2. In addition, the α1,6-fucosylation level on the activin receptors was greatly decreased in KD cells, while the total expression level was unchanged, suggesting that α1,6-fucosylation negatively regulated activin-mediated signaling. Furthermore, inhibition of activin receptor-mediated signaling or restoration of Fut8 expression rescued cell morphology and phospho-Smad2 levels, which were enhanced in KD cells. Considering the fact that α1,6-fucosylation is important for TGF-β-mediated signaling, the results of this study strongly suggest that Fut8 plays a dual role in TGF-β/activin-mediated signaling.—Gu, W., Fukuda, T., Isaji, T., Hashimoto, H., Wang, Y., Gu, J., α1,6-Fucosylation regulates neurite formation via the activin/phospho-Smad2 pathway in PC12 cells: the implicated dual effects of Fut8 for TGF-β/activin-mediated signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2097867931,"Regional-based association analysis instead of individual testing of each SNP was introduced in genome-wide association studies to increase the power of gene mapping, especially for rare genetic variants. For regional association tests, the kernel machine-based regression approach was recently proposed as a more powerful alternative to collapsing-based methods. However, the vast majority of existing algorithms and software for the kernel machine-based regression are applicable only to unrelated samples. In this paper, we present a new method for the kernel machine-based regression association analysis of quantitative traits in samples of related individuals. The method is based on the GRAMMAR+ transformation of phenotypes of related individuals, followed by use of existing kernel machine-based regression software for unrelated samples. We compared the performance of kernel-based association analysis on the material of the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 family sample and real human data by using our transformation, the original untransformed trait, and environmental residuals. We demonstrated that only the GRAMMAR+ transformation produced type I errors close to the nominal value and that this method had the highest empirical power. The new method can be applied to analysis of related samples by using existing software for kernel-based association analysis developed for unrelated samples."

Ischemic retinal diseases are triggered by vaso-obliteration and/or vessel remodeling caused by various factors, including hyperglycemia associated with diabetes, thrombosis in vein occlusion, and hyperoxic injury linked to premature birth (1.Bradley J.

As compensatory revascularization occurs to replenish regions of poorly perfused retina, an aberrant intravitreal preretinal neovascularization ensues. This is a major sight-threatening complication due to the abnormally formed fibrovascular tissue that can hemorrhage and apply tractional forces to the retina resulting in retinal detachment and possibly blindness, a hallmark of late stage diabetic retinopathy, age-macular degeneration, and retinopathy of prematurity. Of the various factors implicated in the pathogenesis of neovascularization, extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; PDR, proliferative diabetic retinopathy; IGFBP, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein; vWC, von Willebrand factor type C; TSP1, thrombospondin type 1; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; qPCR, quantitative real time PCR; CM, conditioned medium; OIR, oxygen-induced retinopathy; REC, retinal endothelial cell; P, postnatal day; CT, C-terminal cysteine knot. proteins play a critical role serving as a storage site for many pathological factors that are readily released during matrix degradation as active growth factors (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β) (3.Lu P.

ECM proteins are also a direct source of angiostatic and proangiogenic regulatory proteins, many of which are cryptic domains of larger molecules. Conformational changes of ECM molecules or their proteolytic processing expose their active domains that often act by binding to integrins to induce vascular cell growth, migration, differentiation, and/or gene reprogramming. Such cryptic peptides as endostatin, tumstatin, canstatin, and endoreppelin are known to have a regulatory role in blood vessel remodeling and hold promise as possible therapeutic agents (5.Boosani C.S. Sudhakar Y.A. Proteolytically derived endogenous angioinhibitors originating from the extracellular matrix.Pharmaceuticals. 2011; 4: 1551-1577Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The matricellular protein CCN1, also known as cysteine-rich protein 61, is an ECM-associated immediate early gene-encoded protein, which exhibits a highly restricted and dynamic pattern of expression at sites of vascularization and skeletogenesis during development and in pathological states (6.Jun J.I. Lau L.F. Taking aim at the extracellular matrix: CCN proteins as emerging therapeutic targets.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2011; 10: 945-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar).

In this study, we show that CCN1 degradome products containing fewer modules were generated in a context environment characterized by elevated levels of matrix-degradative enzymes both in vivo and in a cell culture model in vitro. We found that truncation of modular domains of CCN1 boosted the functional capabilities of the truncated variants, which then act as either angiostimulators or angioinhibitors in the context of ischemic retinopathy. These studies provided evidence that proteolytic processing altering the activity of the CCN1 protein may occur under pathological conditions, which reinforces the notion that the multimodular structure of CCN1 may be a means of generating variants that exhibit a diverse range of agonistic and antagonistic activities reflective of their context environment. Vitreoretinal fluid washes were collected from patients whose primary diagnosis included active PDR with or without vitreous hemorrhage and nondiabetic patients with ocular trauma, macular hole, or macular pucker.

After running through an inert plastic tubing, the fluid was collected in a plastic cartridge. At the end of the procedure, the collection cartridge was disconnected. The fluid was transferred into sterile plastic tubes containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The collected supernatants were concentrated 10–15-fold by ultrafiltration using Centricon columns (GE Healthcare). Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). Levels of CCN1, VEGF, angiopoietin2, and TNF-α were determined by the Quantikine ELISA according to the manufacturer's protocol (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant CCN1 was produced using a Rapid Translation System RTS100 kit (Roche Diagnostics) and was used to generate a standard curve for CCN1 quantification. Sensitivity of the assay was determined to be in the range of 0.5 ng/ml. Full-length mouse CCN1 cDNA was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cloned into a shuttle vector. Three serially truncated variants of the CCN1 gene, CCN11–3, CCN11–2, CCN11 in which the CT, CT and TSP1, and CT, TSP1, and vWC domains were deleted, respectively, were generated by PCR amplification using the full-length cDNA construct as a template. The recombinant adenoviruses, Ad-CCN1, Ad-CCN11–3, Ad-CCN11–2, and Ad-CCN11, were produced by cotransfecting adenoviral shuttle vector with Ad.OBHRE first generation recombinant adenoviral vector (E1/E3 deleted) viral backbone in which recombinant DNA is driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The adenovirus encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, Ad-GFP, was used as a control for infection. Other adenoviral vectors used in the study include the adenoviral vector expressing the MMP-2 gene (Ad-MMP-2) obtained from Vector Biolabs (Philadelphia, PA) and adenovirus expressing the MMP-14 gene provided by Dr. Jane Sottile (University of Rochester, Rochester, NY) (30.Shi F. Sottile J. MT1-MMP regulates the turnover and endocytosis of extracellular matrix fibronectin.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 4039-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All adenoviruses were replication-deficient and used at 20 multiplicities of infection to transduce retinal endothelial cells (REC). For in vivo studies, lentiviral vectors were produced and used because of their transgene capacity, rapid onset of expression, and robust and sustained gene expression profile. Lentiviral vectors expressing either CCN1 (lnv-CCN1), CCN11–3 (lnv-CCN11–3), CCN11–2 (lnv-CCN11–2), CCN11 (lnv-CCN11), or luciferase (lnv-luc) were constructed according to a previously established protocol (31.MacKenzie T.C.

Rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G)-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were produced by transfection of 20 × 150-mm plates of 293T cells with the following three plasmids: the helper packaging construct pCMVDR8.2, the transfer vector, and the plasmid encoding for envelope protein VSV-G using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The proportion of retinal cells transduced with lentiviral particles in a series of random sections (6–12) that spanned at least 50% of the retinal surface varied between 45 and 79% (32.Chintala H.

The Gene Therapy Resource Program of the NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, produced the gene vectors used in this study. Production of viral vectors was performed in the Preclinical Vector Core Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania. Ischemic retinopathy was induced in C57BL/6J mice as described by Smith et al. (33.Smith L.E. Wesolowski E. McLellan A. Kostyk S.K. D'Amato R. Sullivan R. D'Amore P.A. Oxygen-induced retinopathy in the mouse.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 101-111PubMed Google Scholar). Neonatal mice and their nursing dams were exposed to 75% oxygen in a PRO-OX 110 chamber oxygen controller from Biospherix Ltd. (Redfield, NY) between postnatal day 7 (P7) and P12 producing vaso-obliteration and cessation of vascular development in the capillary beds of the central retina. The mice were exposed to a 12-h cyclical broad spectrum light. The room temperature was maintained at 28 °C. On P12, the mice were placed at room air until P17 when the retinas were assessed for maximum neovascular response. For gene therapy studies, animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (65 mg/kg) and xylazine (35 mg/kg). A lentiviral vector (∼1 μl) was injected into the vitreous in one eye of each animal using a 33-gauge needled-syringe. In the contralateral eye, an equal volume of control vector (lnv-luc) was injected. Cells infected with lnv-GFP at 5–10 multiplicities of infection achieved transduction efficiency of 70–90% as determined by counting the number of GFP-positive cells (32.Chintala H. Liu H. Parmar R.

Quantification of vascular obliteration, retinal vascularization, and preretinal neovascular tufts was performed at P12 and P17 as described previously (7.Hasan A. Pokeza N. Shaw L. Lee H.S. Lazzaro D. Chintala H. Rosenbaum D. Grant M.B. Chaqour B. The matricellular protein cysteine-rich protein 61 (CCN1/Cyr61) enhances physiological adaptation of retinal vessels and reduces pathological neovascularization associated with ischemic retinopathy.J.

Retinas were then dissected, flat mounted through four incisions dividing them into four quadrants, and incubated overnight in 10 μg/ml fluorescently labeled Ulex Europaeus Agglutinin (UEA)-1, a specific marker of endothelial cells. Images were acquired using an Olympus fluorescence microscope. The areas of vascular obliteration were measured by delineating the avascular zone in the central retina and calculating the total area using Photoshop CS5 (Adobe). Similarly, the areas of preretinal neovascularization were calculated by selecting tufts, which appear more brightly stained than normal vasculature based on pixel intensities. Selected regions were then summed to generate total area of neovascularization. In vitro studies were performed with rat RECs obtained from Cellpro (San Pedro, CA) and maintained in culture according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were characterized by immunostaining using endothelial cell markers, e.g. von Willebrand factor and CD31 obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA) and Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), respectively. The cells were propagated in 35-mm dishes in predefined endothelial growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) obtained from Atlanta Biological Inc. (San Diego, CA). Cells at 80% confluence were treated as described in the text and further processed for various analyses. Conditioned medium (CM) was obtained from cells transduced with Ad-GFP, Ad-CCN1, Ad-CCN11–3, Ad-CCN11–2, or Ad-CCN11. 12 h after transduction, cells were incubated with low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without FCS for 24 h. Medium was then collected as described in the text. Proliferation rate of RECs was determined using the CyQUANT® direct cell proliferation assay obtained from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5 × 103 RECs were seeded in 96-well plates. After 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were placed in CM enriched with CCN1, CCN11–3, CCN11–2, or CCN11 and incubated for an additional 16 h at 37 °C. Medium was then discarded, and the plates were placed at −80 °C for 2 h. Dye binding solution was added to the wells, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. Fluorescence was measured with a microplate reader with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 530 nm using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter set. In the adhesion assay, cells were seeded in 96-well plates either uncoated or coated overnight (4 °C) with CM-free medium as a control or CM enriched with CCN1, CCN11–3, CCN11–2, or CCN11. The assay was performed in the same adhesion plate for all adhesion substrates tested. Cells were plated at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/well in 100 μl of serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After 4 h, nonadherent and loosely attached cells were washed off by pouring serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA in the wells and placing the plate on a shaker for 3 min at medium speed to generate shear forces as the meniscus passes over the attached cells, thus testing cell resistance to detachment. Adhesion was quantified in duplicate by counting adherent cells using an inverted cell culture microscope. For cell migration, proteins tested for their chemotactic activity were diluted, each in serum-free medium containing 0.5% BSA, and loaded in the lower well of 12-well Transwell plates. The lower well was then covered with a polycarbonate filter (5-μm pore diameter, Nucleopore), which was treated with 2.9% (v/v) glacial acetic acid overnight, and rinsed three times in PBS for 1 h immediately before use. Cells were resuspended in 1.0 ml of pre-equilibrated serum-free medium containing 0.5% BSA and added into each Transwell insert. After incubation for 6 h at 37 °C, the membrane was removed and stained with Diff-Quik. The chemotactic response was determined by counting the total number of cells migrating in 10 randomly selected microscope fields. The formation of capillary-like tubules by endothelial cells was evaluated using a three-dimensional Matrigel. Briefly, pre-cooled BD MatrigelTM matrix growth factor-reduced (BD Biosciences) was filled into the lower compartment of μ-Slide angiogenesis wells (ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) on ice. The slides were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to allow polymerization of the MatrigelTM matrix. Cells (12,000/well) were suspended in serum-free CM or CM enriched with CCN1, CCN11–3, CCN11–2, or CCN11 and plated in wells pre-coated with MatrigelTM for 16 h. Images of the tubular network formed in each well were captured using a high resolution wide field Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope. Microscope images were then analyzed using AngioTool, a software analysis tool that computes several morphological and spatial parameters, including the number of tubes, their density, length, and lacunarity (34.Zudaire E. Gambardella L. Kurcz C. Vermeren S. A computational tool for quantitative analysis of vascular networks.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e27385Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). These experiments were repeated at least three times, and each substrate was tested in triplicate. MMP-2 BiotrackTM ELISA activity (GE Healthcare) was used to measure both endogenously active MMP-2 and total MMP-2 following activation of latent MMP-2 by aminophenylmercuric acetate"
https://openalex.org/W1982409578,"Lupus nephritis (LN) is an autoimmune disorder in which co-stimulatory signals have been involved. Here we tested a cholesterol-conjugated-anti-CD40-siRNA in dendritic cells (DC) in vitro and in a model of LPS to check its potency and tissue distribution. Then, we report the effects of Chol-siRNA in an experimental model of mice with established lupus nephritis. Our in vitro studies in DC show a 100%intracellular delivery of Chol-siRNA, with a significant reduction in CD40 after LPS stimuli. In vivo in ICR mice, the CD40-mRNA suppressive effects of our Chol-siRNA on renal tissue were remarkably sustained over a 5 days after a single preliminary dose of Chol-siRNA. The intra-peritoneal administration of Chol-siRNA to NZB/WF1 mice resulted in a reduction of anti-DNA antibody titers, and histopathological renal scores as compared to untreated animals. The higher dose of Chol-siRNA prevented the progression of proteinuria as effectively as cyclophosphamide, whereas the lower dose was as effective as CTLA4. Chol-siRNA markedly reduced insterstitialCD3+ and plasma cell infiltrates as well as glomerular deposits of IgG and C3. Circulating soluble CD40 and activated splenic lymphocyte subsets were also strikingly reduced by Chol-siRNA. Our data show the potency of our compound for the therapeutic use of anti-CD40-siRNA in human LN and other autoimmune disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1997077463,"Insulin signaling is essential for β-cell survival and proliferation in vivo. Insulin also has potent mitogenic and anti-apoptotic actions on cultured β-cells, with maximum effect in the high picomolar range and diminishing effect at high nanomolar doses. In order to understand whether these effects of insulin are constitutive or can be subjected to physiological modulation, it is essential to estimate the extracellular concentration of monomeric insulin within an intact islet. Unfortunately, the in vivo concentration of insulin monomers within the islet cannot be measured directly with current technology. Here, we present the first mathematical model designed to estimate the levels of monomeric insulin within the islet extracellular space. Insulin is released as insoluble crystals that exhibit a delayed dissociation into hexamers, dimers, and eventually monomers, which only then can act as signaling ligands. The rates at which different forms of insulin dissolve in vivo have been estimated from studies of peripheral insulin injection sites. We used this and other information to formulate a mathematical model to estimate the local insulin concentration within a single islet as a function of glucose. Model parameters were estimated from existing literature. Components of the model were validated using experimental data, if available. Model analysis predicted that the majority of monomeric insulin in the islet is that which has been returned from the periphery, and the concentration of intra-islet monomeric insulin varies from ~50-300 pM when glucose is in the physiological range. Thus, our results suggest that the local concentration of monomeric insulin within the islet is in the picomolar 'sweet spot' range of insulin doses that activate the insulin receptor and have the most potent effects on β-cells in vitro. Together with experimental data, these estimations support the concept that autocrine/paracrine insulin signalling within the islet is dynamic, rather than constitutive and saturated."
https://openalex.org/W2050861850,"Purpose Radiation therapy for invasive bladder cancer allows for organ preservation but toxicity and local control remain problematic. As such, improving efficacy of treatment requires radiosensitization of tumor cells. The aim of study is to investigate if the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), a downstream kinase of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT survival pathway, may be a target for radiation sensitization. Experimental Design Clonogenic assays were performed using 6 bladder cancer cell lines (UM-UC3, UM-UC5, UM-UC6, KU7, 253J-BV, and 253-JP) in order to examine the effects of ionizing radiation (IR) alone and in combination with RAD001, an mTOR inhibitor. Cell cycle analysis was performed using flow cytometry. In vivo, athymic mice were subcutaneously injected with 2 bladder cancer cell lines. Treatment response with RAD001 (1.5 mg/kg, daily), fractionated IR (total 9Gy = 3Gy×3), and combination of RAD001 and IR was followed over 4 weeks. Tumor weight was measured at experimental endpoint. Results Clonogenic assays revealed that in all bladder cell lines tested, an additive effect was observed in the combined treatment when compared to either treatment alone. Our data indicates that this effect is due to arrest in both G1 and G2 phases of cell cycle when treatments are combined. Furthermore, our data show that this arrest is primarily regulated by changes in levels of cyclin D1, p27 and p21 following treatments. In vivo, a significant decrease in tumor weight was observed in the combined treatment compared to either treatment alone or control. Conclusions Altering cell cycle by inhibiting the mTOR signaling pathway in combination with radiation have favorable outcomes and is a promising therapeutic modality for bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2066153865,"In eukaryotic Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers (NCX) the Ca(2+) binding CBD1 and CBD2 domains form a two-domain regulatory tandem (CBD12). An allosteric Ca(2+) sensor (Ca3-Ca4 sites) is located on CBD1, whereas CBD2 contains a splice-variant segment. Recently, a Ca(2+)-driven interdomain switch has been described, albeit how it couples Ca(2+) binding with signal propagation remains unclear. To resolve the dynamic features of Ca(2+)-induced conformational transitions we analyze here distinct splice variants and mutants of isolated CBD12 at varying temperatures by using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and equilibrium (45)Ca(2+) binding assays. The ensemble optimization method SAXS analysis demonstrates that the apo and Mg(2+)-bound forms of CBD12 are highly flexible, whereas Ca(2+) binding to the Ca3-Ca4 sites results in a population shift of conformational landscape to more rigidified states. Population shift occurs even under conditions in which no effect of Ca(2+) is observed on the globally derived Dmax (maximal interatomic distance), although under comparable conditions a normal [Ca(2+)]-dependent allosteric regulation occurs. Low affinity sites (Ca1-Ca2) of CBD1 do not contribute to Ca(2+)-induced population shift, but the occupancy of these sites by 1 mM Mg(2+) shifts the Ca(2+) affinity (Kd) at the neighboring Ca3-Ca4 sites from ∼ 50 nM to ∼ 200 nM and thus, keeps the primary Ca(2+) sensor (Ca3-Ca4 sites) within a physiological range. Thus, Ca(2+) binding to the Ca3-Ca4 sites results in a population shift, where more constraint conformational states become highly populated at dynamic equilibrium in the absence of global conformational transitions in CBD alignment."
https://openalex.org/W2090315300,"Context Fetal stress is relevant to newborn outcomes. Corticosterone is rarely quantified in human clinical endocrinology and is found at much lower concentrations than cortisol. However, fetal corticosterone is a candidate hormone as a fetal stress signal. Objective Test the hypothesis that preferential fetal corticosterone synthesis occurs in response to fetal intra-partum stress. Design Cross-sectional comparison of paired serum corticosteroid concentrations in umbilical artery and vein from 300 women providing consent at admission to a General Hospital Labor and Delivery unit. Pre-term and multiple births were excluded, leaving 265 healthy deliveries. Main Outcome Measures Corticosterone and cortisol concentrations determined by LC-MS/MS for umbilical cord venous (V) and arterial (A) samples and used to calculate fetal synthesis (A−V) and proportional fetal synthesis ([A−V]/V). Chart-derived criteria stratified samples by type of delivery, maternal regional analgesia, augmentation of contractions, and clinical rationale for emergent Caesarian delivery. Results Cortisol concentrations were higher than corticosterone concentrations; however, the fetus preferentially secretes corticosterone (148% vs 49% proportional increase for cortisol) and differentially secretes corticosterone as fetal stress increases. Fetal corticosterone synthesis is elevated after passage through the birth canal relative to Caesarian deliveries. For vaginal deliveries, augmentation of contractions does not affect corticosteroid concentrations whereas maternal regional analgesia decreases venous (maternal) concentrations and increases fetal synthesis. Fetal corticosterone synthesis is also elevated after C-section indicated by cephalopelvic disproportion after labor, whereas cortisol is not. Conclusions The full-term fetus preferentially secretes corticosterone in response to fetal stress during delivery. Fetal corticosterone could serve as a biomarker of fetal stress."
https://openalex.org/W1995120469,"Although lysines are known to be critical for ligand binding to LDL receptor family receptors, relatively small reductions in affinity have been found when such lysines have been mutated. To resolve this paradox, we have examined the specific binding contributions of four lysines, Lys-253, Lys-256, Lys-270, and Lys-289, in the third domain (D3) of receptor-associated protein (RAP), by eliminating all other lysine residues. Using D3 variants containing lysine subsets, we examined binding to the high affinity fragment CR56 from LRP1. With this simplification, we found that elimination of the lysine pairs Lys-253/Lys-256 and Lys-270/Lys-289 resulted in increases in Kd of 1240- and 100,000-fold, respectively. Each pair contributed additively to overall affinity, with 61% from Lys-270/Lys-289 and 39% from Lys-253/Lys-256. Furthermore, the Lys-270/Lys-289 pair alone could bind different single CR domains with similar affinity. Within the pairs, binding contributions of Lys-270 ≫ Lys-256 > Lys-253 ∼ Lys-289 were deduced. Importantly, however, Lys-289 could significantly compensate for the loss of Lys-270, thus explaining how previous studies have underestimated the importance of Lys-270.

https://openalex.org/W2083470757,"Background and Purpose Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is caused by NOTCH3 gene mutations that result in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) degeneration. Its distinctive feature by electron microscopy (EM) is granular osmiophilic material (GOM) detected in VSMC indentations and/or the extracellular space close to VSMCs. Reports of the sensitivity of EM in detecting GOM in biopsies from CADASIL patients are contradictory. We present data from 32 patients clinically suspected to have CADASIL and discuss the role of EM in its diagnosis in this retrospective study. Methods Skin, skeletal muscle, kidney and pericardial biopsies were examined by EM; the NOTCH3 gene was screened for mutations. Skin and muscle biopsies from 12 patients without neurological symptoms served as controls. Results and Discussion All GOM-positive patients exhibited NOTCH3 mutations and vice versa. This study i) confirms that EM is highly specific and sensitive for CADASIL diagnosis; ii) extends our knowledge of GOM distribution in tissues where it has never been described, e.g. pericardium; iii) documents a novel NOTCH3 mutation in exon 3; and iv) shows that EM analysis is critical to highlight the need for comprehensive NOTCH3 analysis. Our findings also confirm the genetic heterogeneity of CADASIL in a small Italian subpopulation and emphasize the difficulties in designing algorithms for molecular diagnosis."

Its chromo shadow domain (CSD) homodimerizes, a requirement for binding protein partners that contain a PXVXL motif. How does HP1a select among its many different PXVXL-containing partners? HP1a binds tightly to Heterochromatin Protein 2 (HP2), but weakly to PIWI. We investigated differences in homodimerization and the impact of the C-terminal extension (CTE) by contrasting HP1a to its paralogue, HP1b. HP1a and HP1b differ in the dimerization interface, with HP1a having an Arg at position 188 rather than Glu. We find that while this substitution reduces the dimerization constant, it does not impact the binding surface as demonstrated by unchanged partner binding affinities. However, the CTE (only 4 residues in HP1a as compared with 87 residues in HP1b) is critical; the charged residues in HP1a are necessary for tight peptide binding. Examining a panel of amino acid substitutions in the HP1a CSD, we find that Leu-165 in HP1a interacts with HP2 but not PIWI, supporting the conclusion that different sites in the binding surface provide discrimination for partner selection. Partner sequence is also critical for affinity, as the remaining difference in binding between HP2 and PIWI polypeptides is eliminated by swapping the PXVXL motifs between the two.

https://openalex.org/W2048369259,"Pavlovian to instrumental transfer (PIT) is a central factor in how cues influence animal behavior. PIT refers to the capacity of a Pavlovian cue that predicts a reward to elicit or increase a response intended to obtain the same reward. In the present study, using an equine model, we assessed whether PIT occurs in hoofed domestic animals and whether its efficacy can be modulated by temperamental dimensions. To study PIT, horses were submitted to Pavlovian conditioning whereby an auditory-visual stimulus was repeatedly followed by food delivery. Then, horses were submitted to instrumental conditioning during which they learned to touch with their noses an object signaled by the experimenter in order to obtain the same reward. During the PIT test, the Pavlovian conditioned stimulus was presented to the animal in the absence of reward. At the end of the experiment, a battery of behavioral tests was performed on all animals to assess five temperamental dimensions and investigate their relationships with instrumental performance. The results indicate that PIT can be observed in horses and that its efficacy is greatly modulated by individual temperament. Indeed, individuals with a specific pattern of temperamental dimensions (i.e., higher levels of gregariousness, fearfulness, and sensory sensitivity) exhibited the strongest PIT. The demonstration of the existence of PIT in domesticated animals (i.e., horses) is important for the optimization of its use by humans and the improvement of training methods. Moreover, because PIT may be implicated in psychological phenomena, including addictive behaviors, the observation of relationships between specific temperamental dimensions and PIT efficacy may aid in identifying predisposing temperamental attributes."

Here we provide evidence that in addition to its nuclear localization, Che-1 localizes at interphase centrosomes, where it accumulates following DNA damage or spindle poisons. We show that Che-1 depletion generates supernumerary centrosomes, multinucleated cells, and multipolar spindle formation. Notably, Che-1 depletion abolishes the ability of Chk1 to bind pericentrin and to localize at centrosomes, which, in its turn, deregulates the activation of centrosomal cyclin B-Cdk1 and advances entry into mitosis. Our results reinforce the notion that Che-1 plays an important role in DDR and that its contribution seems to be relevant for the spindle assembly checkpoint."

A HBD3 mammary-specific expression vector was transfected by electroporation into goat fetal fibroblasts which were used to produce fourteen healthy transgenic goats by somatic cell nuclear transfer. The expression level of rHBD3 in the milk of the six transgenic goats ranged from 98 to 121 µg/ml at 15 days of lactation, and was maintained at 90–111 µg/ml during the following 2 months. Milk samples from transgenic goats showed an obvious inhibitory activity against E. coli, S. aureus and S. agalactiae in vitro. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of rHBD3 in milk against E. coli, S. aureus and S. agalactiae were 9.5–10.5, 21.8–23.0 and 17.3–18.5 µg/mL, respectively, which was similar to those of the HBD3 standard (P>0.05). The in vivo anti-bacterial activities of rHBD3 in milk were examined by intramammary infusion of viable bacterial inoculums. We observed that 9/10 and 8/10 glands of non-transgenic goats infused with S. aureus and E. coli became infected. The mean numbers of viable bacteria went up to 2.9×103 and 95.4×103 CFU/ml at 48 h after infusion, respectively; the mean somatic cell counts (SCC) in infected glands reached up to 260.4×105 and 622.2×105 cells/ml, which were significantly higher than the SCC in uninfected goat glands. In contrast, no bacteria was presented in glands of transgenic goats and PBS-infused controls, and the SSC did not significantly change throughout the period. Moreover, the compositions and protein profiles of milk from transgenic and non-transgenic goats were identical. The present study demonstrated that HBD3 were an effective anti-bacterial protein to enhance the mastitis resistance of dairy animals."

EN is generated by a t(12;15) translocation, which fuses the N-terminal SAM (sterile α-motif) domain of the ETV6 (or TEL) transcription factor to the C-terminal PTK (protein-tyrosine kinase) domain of the neurotrophin-3 receptor NTRK3.

The x-ray crystallographic structure of the ETV6-SAM domain revealed an extended homopolymer in which the SAM monomers are arranged in a head-to-tail fashion (26.Kim C.A. Phillips M.L. Kim W. Gingery M. Tran H.H. Robinson M.A. Faham S. Bowie J.U. Polymerization of the SAM domain of TEL in leukemogenesis and transcriptional repression.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4173-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Two interfaces in each monomer, called the mid-loop and end-helix surfaces, form interdomain hydrophobic cores surrounded by charged residues. Due to high affinity polymerization, the SAM domain is found in the insoluble fractions when expressed in Escherichia coli. However, replacement of either of two critical hydrophobic residues to a negatively charged residue (A93D and V112E, according to the human ETV6 cDNA numbering) within the mid-loop and end-helix surfaces, respectively, renders SAM domain monomeric (26.Kim C.A. Phillips M.L. Kim W. Gingery M. Tran H.H. Robinson M.A. Faham S. Bowie J.U. Polymerization of the SAM domain of TEL in leukemogenesis and transcriptional repression.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4173-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 27.Tran H.H. Kim C.A. Faham S. Siddall M.C. Bowie J.U. Native interface of the SAM domain polymer of TEL.BMC Struct. Biol. 2002; 2: 5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously showed that A93D and V112E mutants of the EN chimera are also monomeric and cannot form high molecular weight complexes in the cells (28.Tognon C.E. Mackereth C.D. Somasiri A.M. McIntosh L.P. Sorensen P.H. Mutations in the SAM domain of the ETV6-NTRK3 chimeric tyrosine kinase block polymerization and transformation activity.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4636-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These mutant EN proteins fail to activate their PTK domains and downstream signaling pathways (PI3K-Akt and Ras-MAPK) and, therefore, lack transformation activity. These studies suggested that SAM-PTK fusion oncoproteins could be inactivated by blocking SAM-mediated polymer formation. However, inhibiting the polymerization of SAM-PTK fusion oncoproteins by targeting the hydrophobic interaction core may be difficult as there are no obvious small molecule binding pockets in the interaction face of SAM monomers (28.Tognon C.E. Mackereth C.D. Somasiri A.M. McIntosh L.P. Sorensen P.H. Mutations in the SAM domain of the ETV6-NTRK3 chimeric tyrosine kinase block polymerization and transformation activity.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4636-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, other possible mechanisms need to be explored to identify alternative strategies for targeting SAM polymerization. The WT ETV6 transcription factor has been reported to be sumoylated at Lys-99 within the SAM domain. Mutation of this residue resulted in decreased sumoylation and inhibited nuclear export of the transcription factor (29.Chakrabarti S.R. Sood R. Nandi S. Nucifora G. Posttranslational modification of TEL and TEL/AML1 by SUMO-1 and cell-cycle-dependent assembly into nuclear bodies.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 13281-13285Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 30.Wood L.D. Irvin B.J. Nucifora G. Luce K.S. Hiebert S.W. Small ubiquitin-like modifier conjugation regulates nuclear export of TEL, a putative tumor suppressor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3257-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, recent studies, which employed mutational or mass spectrometry-based proteomics approaches, identified Lys-11 within the unstructured N-terminal sequence preceding the SAM domain, and not Lys-99, as the major SUMO modification site in ETV6 (31.Roukens M.G. Alloul-Ramdhani M. Vertegaal A.C. Anvarian Z. Balog C.I. Deelder A.M. Hensbergen P.J. Baker D.A. Identification of a new site of sumoylation on Tel (ETV6) uncovers a PIAS-dependent mode of regulating Tel function.Mol. Cell.

This implies that Lys-99 may affect ETV6 function in a manner other than as a SUMO acceptor. Interestingly, Lys-99 lies in the interface of two SAM monomers and contributes to a salt bridge surrounding the hydrophobic interaction core of the SAM polymer (26.Kim C.A. Phillips M.L. Kim W. Gingery M. Tran H.H. Robinson M.A. Faham S. Bowie J.U. Polymerization of the SAM domain of TEL in leukemogenesis and transcriptional repression.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4173-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Lys-99 may play a critical role in the self-association of SAM domain. In this study we examined whether electrostatic interactions involving Lys-99 are important for SAM-mediated EN polymerization and cellular transformation. We demonstrate that site-directed mutation of Lys-99 abrogates the ability of EN to transform NIH3T3 cells, impedes EN polymerization, and weakens SAM domain self-association. We also mutated other residues in the interface of SAM polymer that were predicted to participate in the salt bridge involving Lys-99 and tested the ability of these EN “salt bridge mutants” to transform NIH3T3 cells. Most notably, mutation of Asp-101, which is the Lys-99 intermolecular salt bridge partner, similarly blocks EN transformation. Both Lys-99 and Asp-101 mutants of EN exhibit defects in PTK activation, Akt, and Mek1/2 signaling as well as in tumor formation in nude mice. Moreover, using computational analysis of the SAM polymer structure, we identified two small molecule binding pockets at or near the salt bridge involving Lys-99 and Asp-101. Our results demonstrate the importance of salt bridge formation within the SAM polymer interface for SAM polymerization and EN transformation. Generation of full-length EN cDNA, ΔSAM-EN (SAM domain deleted EN), and K380N-EN (kinase dead EN) constructs were described previously (18.Wai D.H. Knezevich S.R. Lucas T. Jansen B. Kay R.J. Sorensen P.H. The ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion encodes a chimeric protein tyrosine kinase that transforms NIH3T3 cells.Oncogene. 2000; 19: 906-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These cDNAs were cloned into the EcoRI sites of the MSCVpuro retroviral expression vector (Clontech) as described (33.Lannon C.L. Martin M.J. Tognon C.E. Jin W. Kim S.J. Sorensen P.H. A highly conserved NTRK3 C-terminal sequence in the ETV6-NTRK3 oncoprotein binds the phosphotyrosine binding domain of insulin receptor substrate-1. An essential interaction for transformation.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6225-6234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Before site-directed mutagenesis, the full-length EN cDNA in MSCVpuro vector was amplified by PCR. Then these amplified PCR products with 5′-SalI and 3′-EcoRI restriction sites were subcloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These constructs were designated as FLAG-EN-ZBTOPO or HA-EN-ZBTOPO. FLAG-EN-ZB-TOPO plasmid was used as template for the point mutations of Lys-99 and Arg-103 residues, and HA-EN-ZB-TOPO was used for Asp-101 and Glu-100 residues using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). After confirming the correct mutations by sequencing, the cDNAs were cut from the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector using the SalI and EcoRI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs) and cloned into the MSCVpuro vector precut with XhoI and EcoRI restriction enzymes. The cDNA encoding residues 43–125 of the WT human ETV6-SAM domain, preceded by an N-terminal His6 affinity tag, was PCR-amplified from the full-length EN construct and cloned into the pET28a vector (Invitrogen). QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was performed to introduce the K99R, A93D, and V112E mutations. Leader sequences of either MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHIH (for thrombin cleavage) or MHHHHHHSSGRENLYFQGHIH (for tobacco etch virus cleavage) were incorporated into the V112E and A93D variants, respectively. All resulting plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The SAM domain constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 cells, grown at 37 °C to A600 of ∼0.6, induced with 1 mm IPTG, and grown at 30 °C overnight. LB media was used to produce unlabeled protein, and M9 minimal media supplemented with 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl was used for 15N labeling. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mm imidazole, 50 mm Na2HPO4, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 buffer, and lysed by sonication and by passage through a French press. The soluble extract was applied to a 5-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (GE Healthcare). After washing with the same lysis buffer, the bound protein was eluted with 500 mm imidazole, 50 mm Na2HPO4, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 buffer. The desired protein samples were pooled and dialyzed overnight into 20 mm MOPS, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, at pH 8.0. The His6 tags were cleaved only for samples characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Protein concentrations were determined using predicted molar absorptivities, ϵ280. Experiments were run at 25 °C on a 600 MHz Bruker Avance III NMR spectrometer. The protein samples were dialyzed into 20 mm MOPS, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA at pH 8.0 and concentrated via Amicon centrifugal filters to 0.25–1 mm followed by the addition of 10% D2O for the signal lock. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed with an ITC200 instrument (GE Healthcare), and the resulting data were processed using Origin 7.0. Experiments were conducted with samples in 20 mm MOPS, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA at pH 8.0 and 25 °C. The titrations consisted of 1.5–2.0-μl injections of A93D or A93D/K99R SAM domain constructs (0.16–0.4 mm) into a cell with 10-fold less concentrated V112E or K99R/V112E protein. NIH3T3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM (Sigma) containing 10% calf serum (Sigma) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Phoenix A (amphotropic) cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS (Sigma) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For suspension cultures, 3 × 105 cells were seeded in poly(2-hydroxy methacrylate)-coated 6-well tissue culture plates and grown for 48 h.

NIH3T3 cells were infected with the virus, and the successfully infected cells were selected with puromycin (Sigma) for 48 h. Soft agar assays were performed as described previously (28.Tognon C.E.

Two drops of media were added on the agar medium to feed the cells every other day. After 2 weeks, the pictures of the wells were taken (3 different sections/well) at 4× magnification, and the single cells and colonies were counted using ImageJ software. Results are given as percentages of colonies formed per total number of events counted. Subconfluent NIH3T3 cells expressing the various EN constructs were washed 2× with ice-cold PBS and lysed with the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche Applied Science) and passed through a 23-gauge syringe for complete lysis of the cells. Protein concentration was determined using DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). For analysis of the total cell lysates, equal concentrations of cell lysates were mixed with 6× SDS sample buffer to a final concentration of 2× and run on a 9% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) before immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, lysates containing 1 mg of protein were mixed with 1 μg of NTRK3 antibody and 40 μl (50% slurry) of Protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle rotation. Beads were washed 3× with the wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and the immunoprecipitates were eluted by the addition of 40 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. Antibodies used (1:1000 in 1% milk) were: TrkC (C-15) (recognizes the C-terminal region of NTRK3) (Santa Cruz), total Akt, total PARP, phospho-Ser-473-Akt, phospho-Mek1/2, and 4G10 phosphotyrosine (Upstate). NIH3T3 cells expressing non-mutated and mutant EN proteins were lysed in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.4% Nonidet P-40 and fractionated by FPLC using a Superose 6HR10/30 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). Fractions were run on a SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblots using NTRK3 antibody. Pathogen-free athymic nude mice, 6–8 weeks old, were purchased from Harlan Laboratories. One million NIH3T3 cells expressing EN, HA-EN, or EN mutants (K99R, D101K, and R103A) were injected subcutaneously at two sites/animal (n = 6 for D101K-EN, 5 mice/group for others) for a total of 10 monitored sites for each cell line (12 sites for D101K-EN). Animals were housed in laminar flow racks and microisolator cages under specific pathogen-free conditions and received autoclaved food and water. Nude mice were evaluated for tumor growth periodically until 30 days after injection. Tumor volume was estimated using the following formula: tumor length × (tumor width)2 × 0.5236. Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to compare tumor volume among the groups represented for the indicated day. The small molecule binding sites were predicted using the PocketFinder program (35.An J. Totrov M. Abagyan R. Pocketome via comprehensive identification and classification of ligand binding envelopes.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 752-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) based on the ETV6-SAM domain polymer crystal structure (PDB ID 1JI7). This program uses a transformation of the Lennard-Jones potential calculated from a three-dimensional protein structure. The PocketFinder algorithm was validated as described previously (35.An J.

To determine if Lys-99 is important for transformation activity of EN, we replaced this residue with arginine (K99R-EN) by site-directed mutagenesis and tested its ability to transform NIH3T3 fibroblasts. We used a soft agar colony formation assay with EN-expressing cells as positive controls and empty MSCV vector-transduced cells as negative controls. As shown in Fig. 1A, unlike NIH3T3 cells stably expressing EN, cells expressing either K99R-EN or the control MSCV vector failed to form colonies in soft agar. We previously showed that NIH3T3 cells transformed by EN are resistant to detachment-induced apoptosis (anoikis) (36.Martin M.J. Melnyk N. Pollard M. Bowden M. Leong H. Podor T.J. Gleave M.

https://openalex.org/W2013853655,"Zinc finger nucleases (ZFN) are powerful tools for editing genes in cells. Here we use ZFNs to interrogate the biological function of ADPGK, which encodes an ADP-dependent glucokinase (ADPGK), in human tumour cell lines. The hypothesis we tested is that ADPGK utilises ADP to phosphorylate glucose under conditions where ATP becomes limiting, such as hypoxia. We characterised two ZFN knockout clones in each of two lines (H460 and HCT116). All four clones had frameshift mutations in all alleles at the target site in exon 1 of ADPGK, and were ADPGK-null by immunoblotting. ADPGK knockout had little or no effect on cell proliferation, but compromised the ability of H460 cells to survive siRNA silencing of hexokinase-2 under oxic conditions, with clonogenic survival falling from 21±3% for the parental line to 6.4±0.8% (p = 0.002) and 4.3±0.8% (p = 0.001) for the two knockouts. A similar increased sensitivity to clonogenic cell killing was observed under anoxia. No such changes were found when ADPGK was knocked out in HCT116 cells, for which the parental line was less sensitive than H460 to anoxia and to hexokinase-2 silencing. While knockout of ADPGK in HCT116 cells caused few changes in global gene expression, knockout of ADPGK in H460 cells caused notable up-regulation of mRNAs encoding cell adhesion proteins. Surprisingly, we could discern no consistent effect on glycolysis as measured by glucose consumption or lactate formation under anoxia, or extracellular acidification rate (Seahorse XF analyser) under oxic conditions in a variety of media. However, oxygen consumption rates were generally lower in the ADPGK knockouts, in some cases markedly so. Collectively, the results demonstrate that ADPGK can contribute to tumour cell survival under conditions of high glycolytic dependence, but the phenotype resulting from knockout of ADPGK is cell line dependent and appears to be unrelated to priming of glycolysis in these lines."
https://openalex.org/W2078544868,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rdh54 protein is a member of the Swi2/Snf2 family of DNA translocases required for meiotic and mitotic recombination and DNA repair. Rdh54 interacts with the general recombinases Rad51 and Dmc1 and promotes D-loop formation with either recombinase. Rdh54 also mediates the removal of Rad51 from undamaged chromatin in mitotic cells, which prevents formation of nonrecombinogenic complexes that can otherwise become toxic for cell growth. To determine which of the mitotic roles of Rdh54 are dependent on Rad51 complex formation, we finely mapped the Rad51 interaction domain in Rdh54, generated N-terminal truncation variants, and characterized their attributes biochemically and in cells. Here, we provide evidence suggesting that the N-terminal region of Rdh54 is not necessary for the response to the DNA-damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate. However, truncation variants missing 75-200 residues at the N terminus are sensitive to Rad51 overexpression. Interestingly, a hybrid protein containing the N-terminal region of Rad54, responsible for Rad51 interaction, fused to the Swi2/Snf2 core of Rdh54 is able to effectively complement the sensitivity to both methyl methanesulfonate and excess Rad51 in rdh54 null cells. Altogether, these results reveal a distinction between damage sensitivity and Rad51 removal with regard to Rdh54 interaction with Rad51."
https://openalex.org/W1969619877,"Regulation of inwardly rectifying potassium channels by intracellular ligands couples cell membrane excitability to important signaling cascades and metabolic pathways. We investigated the molecular mechanisms that link ligand binding to the channel gate in ATP-sensitive Kir6.2 channels. In these channels, the “slide helix” forms an interface between the cytoplasmic (ligand-binding) domain and the transmembrane pore, and many slide helix mutations cause loss of function. Using a novel approach to rescue electrically silent channels, we decomposed the contribution of each interface residue to ATP-dependent gating. We demonstrate that effective inhibition by ATP relies on an essential aspartate at residue 58. Characterization of the functional importance of this conserved aspartate, relative to other residues in the slide helix, has been impossible because of loss-of-function of Asp-58 mutant channels.

Inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) 3The abbreviations used are: Kir, inwardly rectifying potassium; ANOVA, analysis of variance; TMD, transmembrane domain; CTD, cytoplasmic domain. channels are essential regulators of membrane excitability. Their functional hallmark is preferential conduction of ions in the inward direction due to voltage-dependent block by Mg2+ and polyamines at voltages larger than the K+ reversal potential (1.Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Inward rectifier potassium channels.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 2.Lu Z.

This unique voltage dependence underlies the main functional difference between Kir channels and their voltage-gated (Kv) relatives because Kir channels exhibit activity near the potassium reversal potential and contribute significantly to regulation of the resting membrane voltage. Disruption of Kir channel function underlies numerous genetically inherited diseases of ion transport and membrane excitability, including Andersen syndrome (3.Schulze-Bahr E.

In addition to voltage-dependent blockade, some Kir channels (in the Kir3 and Kir6 families) are regulated by ligand-dependent gating that controls conformational changes around the helix bundle crossing (in the transmembrane domain) and, potentially, a second auxiliary gate in the cytoplasmic G loop (13.Pegan S.

One very well known example is regulation of heart rate by the sinoatrial node IKACh current (mediated by G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels) (18.Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y.

A second example is regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by KATP channels (the pancreatic KATP isoform comprises the Kir6.2 and SUR1 (sulfonylurea receptor 1) subunits and is the model for ligand-dependent gating used in this study) (19.Inagaki N.

In this physiological system, glucose metabolism elevates intracellular ATP, leading to inhibition of KATP channels and membrane depolarization, triggering Ca2+ influx essential for insulin secretion (9.Nichols C.G.

In place of the voltage-sensing domain that typifies the Kv channel family, the Kir channel pore module is coupled to a cytoplasmic domain that extends the ion permeation pathway and serves as a ligand-binding site for regulatory molecules like Gβγ subunits (in Kir3 channels) or ATP (in Kir6 channels) (16.Whorton M.R.

In addition, all Kir channels require phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate for channel activity, and recent crystallographic studies have demonstrated that the binding site for this essential phospholipid is formed predominantly by positively charged side chains in the C-terminal extension (“C-linker”) of the pore-lining M2 helix (15.Hansen S.B.

This modular architecture necessitates a mechanism for transduction of ligand binding to the channel gate. The observation of a transverse interfacial helix (the “slide helix”) in Kir channel structures has provoked considerable speculation regarding its role as a mediator of coupling between the cytoplasmic (“ligand-sensing”) and transmembrane (“gating”) domains (22.Kuo A.

We have taken a systematic structure-based approach to investigate the role of the slide helix and identify components that are essential for functional channel expression and ATP inhibition of Kir6.2 channels. Importantly, our experiments tackle a frequently encountered problem in structure-function studies of ion channels: mutations in particularly interesting channel motifs often lead to loss of function, impeding further analysis. We describe an effective targeted approach to rescue of loss-of-function mutants, enabling characterization of mutants that have been overlooked because of their loss-of-function phenotype. All mutant channel constructs were generated from mouse WT Kir6.2 expressed in the pcDNA3.1(-) plasmid (Invitrogen). All channel constructs had GFP fused to the Kir6.2 C terminus by a 6× glycine linker. Point mutations were introduced by overlapping PCR-based methods, followed by subcloning of the desired fragments into pcDNA3.1(-) and verification by restriction endonuclease digestion and Sanger sequencing (Genewiz). SUR1 (hamster) and FLAG-SUR1 (a gift from Show-Ling Shyng, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, Oregon) were also expressed in pcDNA3.1(-). COSm6 cells were maintained in culture in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected with channel constructs and hamster SUR1 using either FuGENE6 (Roche) or jetPRIME (Polyplus). Recordings were done 2–3 days following transfection. For continuous recordings, data were filtered at 1 kHz, sampled at 5 kHz, and stored directly on a computer hard drive using Clampex software (Axon Inc.). For voltage-step recordings, data were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. Symmetrical recording solutions with the following composition were used: 140 mm KCl, 1 mm K-EGTA, 1 mm K-EDTA, and 4 mm K2HPO4. The pipette solution was adjusted to pH 7.3 using KOH. Bath solution pH was adjusted with KOH or HCl. The bath solution pH was verified each experimental day for each solution, with particular attention to the addition of solutes that can affect solution pH (such as ATP). Solutions were delivered at room temperature by pressure-driven flow (syringe pump) through a multibarreled solution delivery turret driven by the RSC-200 (BioLogic) rapid solution exchanger to enable solution jumps. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher. Throughout the text, data are presented as mean ± S.E. CosM6 cells were transiently transfected with SUR1 and various Kir6.2 mutants with FuGENE6 (Roche) or jetPRIME (Polyplus), and efflux assays were performed after 2 days. Cells were loaded for 1 h with Rb+ loading medium (5.4 mm RbCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES (pH7.4)), washed twice quickly with PBS, and incubated in assay buffer (118 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 4.7 mm KCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) supplemented with metabolic inhibitors (2.5 μg/ml oligomycin, 1 mm 2-deoxy-D-glucose) when indicated. Aliquots of the assay buffer were removed at multiple time points (5, 10, 20, and 40 min), and the Rb+ concentration was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy using an Aurora Biomed ICR8000. Rb+ efflux was calculated as a fraction of total loaded Rb+ (determined as the sum of extruded Rb+ and Rb+ left in lysed cells at the end of the assay). For clarity of figure presentation, data were normalized to efflux from WT Kir6.2-transfected cells (normalized Rb+ efflux = (EffluxMutant − EffluxUntransfected)/(EffluxWT Kir6.2 − EffluxUntransfected). However, raw efflux data were used for statistical tests. For simplicity, only data from the 40-min time point has been presented (as mean ± S.E.). COSm6 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with mouse Kir6.2 channel cDNA (600 ng/well) and either FLAG-tagged hamster SUR1 (1.2 μg/well) or WT hamster SUR1 (1.2 μg/well) as indicated in the respective figures. After 3 days of incubation, Western blotting was carried out on total cell lysates, using 7.5% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. SUR1 protein was detected by labeling with mouse anti-FLAG primary antibody (for FLAG-SUR1, Sigma-Aldrich), or a monoclonal SUR1 antibody (University of California Davis/National Institutes of Health NeuroMab facility, clone N289/16, for WT SUR1) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (ABM, Vancouver, Canada). Blots were visualized by ECL methods (Femto ECL detection kit, Pierce) using a FluorChem SP gel imager (Alpha Innotech). All experiments required multiple comparisons of mutants with WT Kir6.2 or Kir6.2[F168E] channels. After confirmation of normality, we used a one-way ANOVA multiple comparison test followed by Dunnett's post hoc test to compare mutants with WT Kir6.2 or Kir6.2[F168E] background channels, as indicated in the appropriate figure legends. The modular structure of Kir channels comprises a canonical pore-forming transmembrane domain (TMD) and a cytoplasmic domain (CTD) (Fig. 1A). The TMD forms an interface with the CTD via the N-terminal transverse slide helix and the C-terminal extension (C-linker) of the pore-lining M2 helix (Fig. 1A) (15.Hansen S.B. Tao X. MacKinnon R.

We have designated them helix Sa and helix Sb on the basis of a “kink” apparent in recent eukaryotic Kir crystal structures (15.Hansen S.B. Tao X. MacKinnon R.

It is noteworthy that helix Sb is very highly conserved among the eukaryotic Kir channels, whereas helix Sa is more divergent (Fig. 1B). However the functional significance of the slide helix kink is not known. We tested whether slide helix mutants could form functional channels by scanning their activity (coexpressed with SUR1) using a non-radioactive Rb+ efflux assay (Fig. 2A). Under conditions of metabolic inhibition (2-deoxy-D-glucose + oligomycin to activate KATP channels, Fig. 2A, black bars), robust Rb+ efflux was observed through seven of 10 helix Sa mutants, whereas six of 10 helix Sb mutants exhibited significant or complete loss of function. Overall, these data are consistent with Rb+ efflux experiments conducted in the absence of metabolic inhibition (Fig. 2A, white bars). Channel mutants with complete loss of function (e.g. F55A, D58A, F60A, T61A, D65A) exhibit little activity in either condition, whereas other mutants (with less extreme loss of function, e.g. L56A, T62A, L66A) exhibit some residual activity that is apparent in metabolic inhibition conditions. These findings highlight a significant challenge that must be overcome to systematically scan the functional role/impact of residues in the interfacial slide helix on ligand-dependent gating. That is, a large fraction of mutations in this region prevent expression of functional channels. Because of the significant loss of function of numerous slide helix mutants, we aimed to determine the underlying defect(s) and explore mechanisms to rescue and characterize channel function. We first investigated whether loss of function of slide helix mutants resulted from a trafficking deficiency using Western blot analysis and cell surface biotinylation of SUR1. As described elsewhere, maturation and glycosylation of SUR1 (dependent on SUR1 interaction with Kir6.2) generates a high molecular weight band (mature, Fig. 2B, Mat), whereas immature “core” glycosylated SUR1 comprises a lower molecular weight band (immature, Imm) (31.Zerangue N.

Total protein expression level varied somewhat between specific mutant channels, most likely because of differences in transfection efficiency (all Western blot analyses were performed on transiently transfected cells expressing Kir6.2 mutants and SUR1). However, all Kir6.2 slide helix mutants examined appeared to confer maturation of SUR1 (Fig. 2B) on the basis of the appearance of a higher molecular weight band. Furthermore, all Kir6.2 slide helix mutants generated increased mature:immature SUR1 ratios relative to cells transfected with SUR1 alone (Fig. 2C). The glycosylation event(s) resulting in the higher molecular weight band do not directly demonstrate cell surface expression. Using cell surface biotinylation and purification on streptavidin beads (Fig. 3), we observed that the upper band is enriched selectively in the biotinylated “surface fraction,” confirming that the upper band on SDS-PAGE corresponds to cell surface protein. We also used surface biotinylation to confirm that loss-of-function slide helix mutants (identified in Fig. 2) were reaching the cell surface (Fig. 3, A and B). All loss-of-function slide helix mutants exhibit a pattern comparable with channels comprising WT Kir6.2 + SUR1 in which a significant upper band was observed, and the upper band was enriched selectively in the surface-labeled fraction. We also included negative controls using a trafficking-deficient SUR1 mutant (R1419H) and a trafficking-deficient Kir6.2 mutant (H259R) reported previously to disrupt cell surface KATP expression (34.Tornovsky S.

Channels made up of Kir6.2 + SUR1[R1419H] or Kir6.2[H259R] + WT SUR1 did not exhibit an upper band and generated very little surface biotinylated signal, indicating that the lower band does not appear significantly at the cell surface (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that loss of function in the slide helix mutants arises from a failure to form conductive channels rather than a failure to traffic to the cell surface. For the remainder of the study, we focus on a novel “forced gating” approach to rescue function in electrically silent mutants, allowing a systematic scan of the functional contributions of slide helix residues to ATP-dependent gating of Kir6.2. Because of the loss-of-function phenotype of numerous slide helix mutants, we sought to further investigate the functional role of this motif. An approach reported previously to recover function in Kir6.2 loss-of-function channels was to express mutants on Cys-166 mutant backgrounds with high intrinsic open probability (e.g. C166A, or C166S channels) (36.Ribalet B.

https://openalex.org/W1984287325,"The UT-A1 urea transporter plays an important role in the urinary concentration mechanism. However, the molecular mechanisms regarding UT-A1 trafficking, endocytosis, and degradation are still unclear. In this study, we identified the small GTPase Rab14 as a binding partner to the C terminus of UT-A1 in a yeast 2-hybrid assay. Interestingly, UT-A1 binding is preferential for the GDP-bound inactive form of Rab14. Coinjection of Rab14 in Xenopus oocytes results in a decrease of UT-A1 urea transport activity, suggesting that Rab14 acts as a negative regulator of UT-A1. We subsequently found that Rab14 reduces the cell membrane expression of UT-A1, as evidenced by cell surface biotinylation. This effect is blocked by chlor-promazine, an inhibitor of the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway, but not by filipin, an inhibitor of the caveolin-mediated endocytic pathway. In kidney, Rab14 is mainly expressed in IMCD epithelial cells with a pattern identical to UT-A1 expression. Consistent with its role in participating in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, Rab14 localizes in nonlipid raft microdomains and codistributes with Rab5, a marker of the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway. Taken together, our study suggests that Rab14, as a novel UT-A1 partner, may have an important regulatory function for UT-A1 urea transport activity in the kidney inner medulla.—Su, H., Liu, B., Fröhlich, O., Ma, H., Sands, J.

https://openalex.org/W2018404754,"Objectives Examination of sensorimotor activation alone in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients may not yield a comprehensive view of cerebral response to task stimulation. Additional information may be obtained by examining the negative BOLD response (deactivation). Aim of this work was to characterize activation and deactivation patterns during passive hand movements in MS patients. Methods 13 relapsing remitting-MS patients (RRMS), 18 secondary progressive-MS patients (SPMS) and 15 healthy controls (HC) underwent an fMRI study during passive right-hand movements. Activation and deactivation contrasts in the three groups were entered into ANOVA, age and gender corrected. Post-hoc analysis was performed with one-sample and two-sample t-tests. For each patient we obtained lesion volume (LV) from both T1- and T2-weighted images. Results Activations showed a progressive extension to the ipsilateral brain hemisphere according to the group and the clinical form (HC<RRMS<SPMS). Significant deactivation of the ipsilateral cortical sensorimotor areas was reduced in both patient groups with respect to HC. Deactivation of posterior cortical areas belonging to the default mode network (DMN), was increased in RRMS, but not in SPMS, with respect to HC. The amount of activation in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex was significantly correlated with that of deactivation in the DMN in HC and RRMS, but not in SPMS. Both increased activation and decreased deactivation patterns correlated with LV. Conclusion In RRMS patients, increased cortical activation was associated with increased deactivation of the posterior cortex suggesting a greater resting-state activity in the DMN, probably aimed at facilitating sensorimotor circuit engagement during task performance. In SPMS the coupling between increased sensorimotor activation/increased DMN deactivation was not observed suggesting disorganization between anticorrelated functional networks as a consequence of a higher level of disconnection."
https://openalex.org/W1973582623,"Background A drug delivery system specifically targeting endothelial cells (ECs) in tumors is required to prevent normal blood vessels from being damaged by angiogenesis inhibitors. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether apelin, a ligand for APJ expressed in ECs when angiogenesis is taking place, can be used for targeting drug delivery to ECs in tumors. Methods and Results Uptake of apelin via APJ stably expressed in NIH-3T3 cells was investigated using TAMRA (fluorescent probe)-conjugated apelin. Both long and short forms of apelin (apelin 36 and apelin 13) were taken up, the latter more effectively. To improve efficacy of apelin- liposome conjugates, we introduced cysteine, with its sulfhydryl group, to the C terminus of apelin 13, resulting in the generation of apelin 14. In turn, apelin 14 was conjugated to rhodamine-encapsulating liposomes and administered to tumor-bearing mice. In the tumor microenvironment, we confirmed that liposomes were incorporated into the cytoplasm of ECs. In contrast, apelin non-conjugated liposomes were rarely found in the cytoplasm of ECs. Moreover, non-specific uptake of apelin-conjugated liposomes was rarely detected in other normal organs. Conclusions ECs in normal organs express little APJ; however, upon hypoxic stimulation, such as in tumors, ECs start to express APJ. The present study suggests that apelin could represent a suitable tool to effectively deliver drugs specifically to ECs within tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2025536935,"The AMPA type of glutamate receptors (AMPARs)-mediated excitotoxicity is involved in the secondary neuronal death following traumatic brain injury (TBI). But the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, the role of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) in GluR2-lacking AMPARs mediated neuronal death was investigated through an in vitro stretch injury model of neurons. It was indicated that both the mRNA and protein levels of PTEN were increased in cultured hippocampal neurons after stretch injury, which was associated with the decreasing expression of GluR2 subunits on the surface of neuronal membrane. Inhibition of PTEN activity by its inhibitor can promote the survival of neurons through preventing reduction of GluR2 on membrane. Moreover, the effect of inhibiting GluR2-lacking AMPARs was similar to PTEN suppression-mediated neuroprotective effect in stretch injury-induced neuronal death. Further evidence identified that the total GluR2 protein of neurons was not changed in all groups. So inhibition of PTEN or blockage of GluR2-lacking AMPARs may attenuate the death of hippocampal neurons post injury through decreasing the translocation of GluR2 subunit on the membrane effectively."
https://openalex.org/W2124121210,"It is universally true in ecological communities, terrestrial or aquatic, temperate or tropical, that some species are very abundant, others are moderately common, and the majority are rare. Likewise, eukaryotic genomes also contain classes or “species” of genetic elements that vary greatly in abundance: DNA transposons, retrotransposons, satellite sequences, simple repeats and their less abundant functional sequences such as RNA or genes. Are the patterns of relative species abundance and diversity similar among ecological communities and genomes? Previous dynamical models of genomic diversity have focused on the selective forces shaping the abundance and diversity of transposable elements (TEs). However, ideally, models of genome dynamics should consider not only TEs, but also the diversity of all genetic classes or “species” populating eukaryotic genomes. Here, in an analysis of the diversity and abundance of genetic elements in >500 eukaryotic chromosomes, we show that the patterns are consistent with a neutral hypothesis of genome assembly in virtually all chromosomes tested. The distributions of relative abundance of genetic elements are quite precisely predicted by the dynamics of an ecological model for which the principle of functional equivalence is the main assumption. We hypothesize that at large temporal scales an overarching neutral or nearly neutral process governs the evolution of abundance and diversity of genetic elements in eukaryotic genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2091417611,"In recent years, the fungal infectious disease zygomycosis has increased in incidence worldwide, especially among the immunodeficient population. Despite the rates of zygomycosis-related death and deformation being very high, the mechanism(s) by which the fungal pathogens cause these severe manifestations remain unknown.Using the associated Rhizomucor variabilis species, which can selectively induce cutaneous zygomycosis in otherwise healthy individuals, we investigated the host mechanisms of infection-related responses, including cytokine and chemokine expression as well as contributions of particular T cell subsets. siRNA specifically targeting IL-22,IL-17 and IFN-γ were used to down-regulate expression of those molecules.In mouse models of infection, IL-22 was implicated in development of Rhizomucor spp.-induced skin lesions. In cultured human peripheral blood monocytes, R. pusilluscan, which is often found in immunodeficient patients, induced the production of IL-22, while R. variabilis did not. Moreover, Rhizomucor spp.-induced secretion of Il-22 from CCR6(+)CCR4(+)CCR10(+) cells was down-regulated by knockdown of IL-22 related signaling receptors, RORC and ARH.Our data strongly suggest that avoidance of IL-22 may be one mechanism by which mucor species produce morbidity and mortality in infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2044315995,"Segmentation is an important step for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). This paper presents a new approach to the fully automatic segmentation of MS lesions in Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. With the aim of increasing the contrast of the FLAIR MR images with respect to the MS lesions, the proposed method first estimates the fuzzy memberships of brain tissues (i.e., the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the normal-appearing brain tissue (NABT), and the lesion). The procedure for determining the fuzzy regions of their member functions is performed by maximizing fuzzy entropy through Genetic Algorithm. Research shows that the intersection points of the obtained membership functions are not accurate enough to segment brain tissues. Then, by extracting the structural similarity (SSIM) indices between the FLAIR MR image and its lesions membership image, a new contrast-enhanced image is created in which MS lesions have high contrast against other tissues. Finally, the new contrast-enhanced image is used to segment MS lesions. To evaluate the result of the proposed method, similarity criteria from all slices from 20 MS patients are calculated and compared with other methods, which include manual segmentation. The volume of segmented lesions is also computed and compared with Gold standard using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and paired samples t test. Similarity index for the patients with small lesion load, moderate lesion load and large lesion load was 0.7261, 0.7745 and 0.8231, respectively. The average overall similarity index for all patients is 0.7649. The t test result indicates that there is no statistically significant difference between the automatic and manual segmentation. The validated results show that this approach is very promising."

https://openalex.org/W2087922772,"The active site conformation of the mutagenic fluoroaminofluorene-deoxyguanine adduct (dG-FAF, N-(2'-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-7-fluoro-2-aminofluorene) has been investigated in the presence of Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Kfexo(-)) and DNA polymerase β (pol β) using (19)F NMR, insertion assay, and surface plasmon resonance. In a single nucleotide gap, the dG-FAF adduct adopts both a major-groove- oriented and base-displaced stacked conformation, and this heterogeneity is retained upon binding pol β. The addition of a non-hydrolysable 2'-deoxycytosine-5'-[(α,β)-methyleno]triphosphate (dCMPcPP) nucleotide analog to the binary complex results in an increase of the major groove conformation of the adduct at the expense of the stacked conformation. Similar results were obtained with the addition of an incorrect dAMPcPP analog but with formation of the minor groove binding conformer. In contrast, dG-FAF adduct at the replication fork for the Kfexo(-) complex adopts a mix of the major and minor groove conformers with minimal effect upon the addition of non-hydrolysable nucleotides. For pol β, the insertion of dCTP was preferred opposite the dG-FAF adduct in a single nucleotide gap assay consistent with (19)F NMR data. Surface plasmon resonance binding kinetics revealed that pol β binds tightly with DNA in the presence of correct dCTP, but the adduct weakens binding with no nucleotide specificity. These results provide molecular insights into the DNA binding characteristics of FAF in the active site of DNA polymerases and the role of DNA structure and sequence on its coding potential."
https://openalex.org/W2093671155,"This paper presents a new method of analysis by which structural similarities between brain data and linguistic data can be assessed at the semantic level. It shows how to measure the strength of these structural similarities and so determine the relatively better fit of the brain data with one semantic model over another. The first model is derived from WordNet, a lexical database of English compiled by language experts. The second is given by the corpus-based statistical technique of latent semantic analysis (LSA), which detects relations between words that are latent or hidden in text. The brain data are drawn from experiments in which statements about the geography of Europe were presented auditorily to participants who were asked to determine their truth or falsity while electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were made. The theoretical framework for the analysis of the brain and semantic data derives from axiomatizations of theories such as the theory of differences in utility preference. Using brain-data samples from individual trials time-locked to the presentation of each word, ordinal relations of similarity differences are computed for the brain data and for the linguistic data. In each case those relations that are invariant with respect to the brain and linguistic data, and are correlated with sufficient statistical strength, amount to structural similarities between the brain and linguistic data. Results show that many more statistically significant structural similarities can be found between the brain data and the WordNet-derived data than the LSA-derived data. The work reported here is placed within the context of other recent studies of semantics and the brain. The main contribution of this paper is the new method it presents for the study of semantics and the brain and the focus it permits on networks of relations detected in brain data and represented by a semantic model."

We examine how feeling skillful, either induced (Experiment 1) or measured (Experiment 2), affects coordination in this type of task. In both experiments participants chose between two lotteries, one offering a larger prize than the other. Participants’ entry into the chosen lottery was either related or unrelated to their skill, with the final prize allocated randomly to one of the entrants in each lottery. Importantly, across conditions skill was irrelevant to choosing between lotteries. Notwithstanding, when skill was related to determining lottery entrants, participants who felt highly skillful chose the high prize lottery excessively. Results further suggest that this stems from high confidence in self skill, rather than incorrect expectations regarding others."
https://openalex.org/W2059161717,"Time-reversal symmetry breaking is a key feature of many classes of natural sounds, originating in the physics of sound production. While attention has been paid to the response of the auditory system to “natural stimuli,” very few psychophysical tests have been performed. We conduct psychophysical measurements of time-frequency acuity for stylized representations of “natural”-like notes (sharp attack, long decay) and the time-reversed versions of these notes (long attack, sharp decay). Our results demonstrate significantly greater precision, arising from enhanced temporal acuity, for such sounds over their time-reversed versions, without a corresponding decrease in frequency acuity. These data inveigh against models of auditory processing that include tradeoffs between temporal and frequency acuity, at least in the range of notes tested and suggest the existence of statistical priors for notes with a sharp-attack and a long-decay. We are additionally able to calculate a minimal theoretical bound on the sophistication of the nonlinearities in auditory processing. We find that among the best studied classes of nonlinear time-frequency representations, only matching pursuit, spectral derivatives, and reassigned spectrograms are able to satisfy this criterion."
