https://openalex.org/W2090486711,"Abstract The sequence of posttranslational events in the export of yeast glycoproteins has been determined with the aid of mutants that affect the secretory apparatus. Temperature-sensitive secretory mutants ( sec ) of S. cerevisiae, when incubated at a nonpermissive growth temperature (37°C), accumulate intracellular precursor forms of exported glycoproteins, such as invertase, and expand or amplify one or more of three different secretory organelles. Characterization of haploid double- sec -mutant strains, with regard to the structure of the accumulated invertase and the morphology of the exaggerated organelles, allows assessment of the order in which the gene products are required, the sequence of invertase maturation steps and a pathway of secretory organelles. The transitions from one organelle to the next require energy and sec gene products. One of the mutants ( sec7 ) accumulates a different organelle depending on the concentration of glucose in the medium. In normal growth medium (2% glucose), a thermally irreversible structure, the Berkeley body, predominates; in low glucose (0.1%), Golgi structures accumulate thermoreversibly. The results are consistent with the following model. Secretory proteins enter the ER, where the initial steps of glycosylation occur. Nine or more sec gene products and energy are required to transfer material to a Golgi-like structure, where further glycosylation occurs. Two or more functions and energy are required to package nearly fully glycosylated proteins into vesicles that are then transported into the bud, where they fuse with the plasma membrane in a process that requires at least ten additional gene products and energy."
https://openalex.org/W2093498871,"A hybrid beta-galactosidase molecule containing a substantial portion of the amino-terminal sequence of the maltose-binding protein is inserted in the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli; in this location, the protein has very low enzymatic activity. The strain producing it is, therefore, Lac-. Selection for derivatives of the fusion strain that are able to grow on lactose yields mutants in which the hybrid protein has become cytoplasmic, and thus has higher enzymatic activity. Among such derivatives, we have isolated a temperature-sensitive conditional lethal mutant that accumulates the precursor of the maltose-binding protein in the cytoplasm, and also accumulates precursors of alkaline phosphatase, lambda receptor protein and the ompF gene gene product. A number of periplasmic proteins are, however, properly localized at the nonpermissive temperature. The temperature-sensitive lesion has been genetically mapped to 2.5 min on the E. coli map, within or near a cluster of genes responsible for cell division and septation. The principle behind the genetic selection employed here should be useful in obtaining other secretion mutants to characterize the cell's secretion machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2041003602,"If daughter copies of unit-copy replicons recombine with each other, a replicon dimer results that cannot be partitioned equally to daughter cells at cell division. We present evidence that dimer formation interferes with plasmid equipartition in the case of a miniplasmid derived from the unit-copy plasmid prophage of bacteriophage P1. Asymmetric partition occurs, leading to a relatively high rate of loss of the plasmid from the growing population. In contrast, the wild-type P1 plasmid is maintained very efficiently in host cells. We show that this efficient maintenance is due to the presence of the loxP-cre site-specific recombination system present on the intact P1 plasmid. This system promotes rapid recombination between two loxP sites on dimer molecules, resolving them into monomeric substrates for proper partition. We suggest that bacterial replicons that are maintained with great accuracy in recombination-proficient cells might also encode high-efficiency recombination systems."
https://openalex.org/W2126135568,"Temperature-sensitive secretory mutants (sec) of S. cerevisiae have been used to evaluate the stages and localization of glycoprotein oligosaccharide synthesis. At the nonpermissive growth temperature (37°C), the sec mutants accumulate secretory organelles and glycoproteins. Histochemical staining and thin-section electron microscopy reveal that the secreted glycoprotein, acid phosphatase, is contained within one of three distinct organelles that accumulate in different mutants: ER; Golgi-like structures called Berkeley bodies; and 80–100 nm vesicles. When produced at 37°C, invertase and acid phosphatase have less carbohydrate in the mutants that accumulate ER than in other mutants, or than in the wild-type strain. External invertase migrates on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as a heterogeneous species with an apparent molecular weight of 100 to 140 kd. Radiolabeled invertase, immunoprecipitated from extracts of ER-accumulating mutant cells, migrates as a set of three discrete protein species with apparent molecular weights of 79, 81, and 83 kd; the other mutants produce a form more like the secreted enzyme. In each case, removal of N-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides by treatment with endoglycosidase H produces a discrete species that migrates as a protein of 61 kd. Immunochemical analysis of bulk glycoprotein accumulated in the mutants suggests that a major portion of the N-linked oligosaccharide, the outer chain, is added after material passes from the ER."
https://openalex.org/W2047486426,"Partially purified thymosin fraction 5 and one of its synthetic peptide components, thymosin beta 4, but not thymosin alpha 1, stimulated secretion of luteinizing hormone--releasing factor from superfused medial basal hypothalami from random cycling female rats. In addition, luteinizing hormone was released from pituitary glands superfused in sequence with hypothalami. No release of luteinizing hormone in response to thymosin was observed from pituitaries superfused alone. These data provide the first evidence of a direct effect of the endocrine thymus on the hypothalamus and suggest a potentially important role for thymic peptides in reproductive function."
https://openalex.org/W2091625139,"Diabetic patients with increased plasma glucose concentrations may develop cerebral symptoms of hypoglycemia when their plasma glucose is rapidly lowered to normal concentrations. The symptoms may indicate insufficient transport of glucose from blood to brain. In rats with chronic hyperglycemia the maximum glucose transport capacity of the blood-brain barrier decreased from 400 to 290 micromoles per 100 grams per minute. When plasma glucose was lowered to normal values, the glucose transport rate into brain was 20 percent below normal. This suggests that repressive changes of the glucose transport mechanism occur in brain endothelial cells in response to increased plasma glucose."
https://openalex.org/W2003590875,Malaria parasites isolated from mouse erythrocytes are lysed by ferriprotoporphyrin IX chloride (hemin) or by a chloroquine-hemin complex in amounts that could be produced by release of less than 0.1 percent of the heme in erythrocytic hemoglobin. This effect of hemin may explain the protection against malaria provided by thalassemia and other conditions causing intracellular denaturation of hemoglobin. The toxicity of the chloroquine-hemin complex may explain the selective antimalarial action of chloroquine.

https://openalex.org/W2002457720,"In a replicated experiment, nonbreeding winter populations of Microtus montanus were given supplements of rolled oats coated with 6-methoxybenzoxazolinone, a naturally occurring plant derivative. After 3 weeks of this feeding regime, samples from the populations demonstrated a high incidence of pregnancy in females and testicular hypertrophy in males. Control populations receiving rolled oats coated only with the solvent showed no reproductive activity. These results demonstrate that the presence of 6-methoxybenzoxazolinone in the plant food resource acts as the ultimate cue to trigger reproductive effort in Microtus montanus."
https://openalex.org/W2077942901,"We have studied regulation of invertase putative structural genes (SUC) in S. cerevisiae and the synthetic relationship between secreted, glycosylated invertase (E.C.3.2.1.26) and the cytoplasmic, nonglycosylated form of the enzyme. Using immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis, we have analyzed invertase polypeptides and glycopeptides synthesized in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of size-fractionated mRNA from a SUC2 strain has shown that three mature, catabolite-repressible mRNA species direct the in vitro synthesis of three invertase polypeptides that have differing molecular weights. Two of these polypeptides, P63 and P62 (63 and 62 kd), are larger than the polypeptides of the secreted enzyme and are cotranslationally processed by microsomal membranes in vitro to yield secreted invertase glycopeptides (GP90 and GP87). The smallest polypeptide, P60 (60 kd), which comigrates electrophoretically with cytoplasmic invertase, is not processed. Posttranslationally, a microsomal-membrane detergent extract removes approximately 20 aminoacids from P62 but not from P60. In vitro translations of mRNAs from a genetically confirmed suc3 mutant strain, from the parental SUC3 strain and from derivative meiotic segregants have shown that the three polypeptides (and therefore three mRNA species) are encoded by one gene. Analysis of in vivo radiolabeled invertase from the same SUC3 and suc3 strains has verified that the SUC3 locus contains the structural gene for secreted and cytoplasmic invertase. Through the derepressed synthesis of multiple primary or processed transcripts, the SUC2 and SUC3 genes are regulated to produce multiple invertase polypeptides. The larger two polypeptides appear to be processed and secreted to yield glycosylated invertase, while the smallest remains in the cytoplasm."

https://openalex.org/W1561361130,"Killer toxin from Saccharomyces cerevisiae inhibited the pumping of protons into the medium by metabolically active sensitive cells. Such inhibition coincided with that of the uptake of potassium ions which are thought to be accumulated by yeast cells in order to neutralize the membrane potential created because of the extrusion of protons. The consumption of glucose, however, was identical in killer-treated and untreated cells. These alterations can be explained by the ability of the toxin to reduce the chemical proton gradient across the plasma membrane as measured by the accumulation of the weak permeable [14C]propionic acid. With this method, an internal pH of 6.42 was calculated from normal cells (the external pH was 4.6) while that of toxin-treated cells was decreased as a function of time. The proton concentration gradient was reduced from 66- to 17-fold. It is shown that the toxin-induced alteration of the proton gradient is due to an enhanced proton permeability of the yeast plasma membrane upon binding of the toxin. It is suggested that killer toxin acts as a macromolecular proton conductor similar in some respects to the known proton conductors 2,4-dinitrophenol and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, since all the described effects are also observed with these substances."
https://openalex.org/W2067182188,"RecA protein makes stable joint molecules from fully duplex DNA and molecules that are partially single-stranded; the latter may be either duplex molecules with an internal gap in one strand or molecules with single-stranded ends. Stable joint molecules form only when the end of at least one strand is in a homologous region. When RecA protein pairs linear duplex molecules and tailed molecules that share the same sequence end to end, the joints, which are located away from the single-stranded tails in most instances, have the electron microscopic appearance associated with the Holliday structure resulting from the reciprocal exchange of strands. The reaction leading to reciprocal strand exchange involves the concerted displacement of a strand from the end of the duplex molecule. These observations support the view that RecA protein makes stable joint molecules only by transferring strands and not by the side-by-side pairing of duplex regions."

https://openalex.org/W2079827423,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two histone H2B protein subtypes, H2B1 and H2B2, which differ at 4 of 130 amino acids. We describe experiments that test whether both histone H2B subtypes are required for the completion of any stage in the yeast life cycle. Frameshift mutations were introduced into cloned copies of the H2B1 and H2B2 genes. These altered genes were integrated into the yeast genome by transformation and replaced the wild-type genes through recombination. We thus obtained strains that lacked functional H2B1 or H2B2 proteins. These mutant strains survive as haploids and homozygous diploids. During vegetative growth, they divide at the same rate as wild-type cells and are able to mate, sporulate and germinate. The h2b1− cells grew more slowly after germination than h2b2− or wild-type spores, but otherwise the mutants were indistinguishable from each other or from wild-type cells. We also attempted to make a strain that was mutant in both genes for H2B. We examined spores derived from a diploid that is heterozygous for both histone mutations. The two genes assort independently, so we expect one in four spores to be h2b1− h2b2−. Of 61 spore colonies examined, none was mutant at both loci. Our results indicate that the double mutant can germinate and bud once but cannot grow further. Since the yeast life cycle can be completed in the absence of either but not both histone H2B subtypes, we conclude that neither protein has a unique essential function."
https://openalex.org/W2056736919,"A vitamin D—dependent calcium binding protein in the chick kidney that was detected by immunocytochemical techniques was localized exclusively in the distal convoluted tubule, the initial collecting tubule, and the early part of the collecting tubule. The intercalated (mitochondria-rich) cells in these tubular segments were negative for the calcium binding protein. Subcellularly, the protein was found in the cytosol and the nucleus of the tubular cells. The results suggest a role for vitamin D—dependent calcium binding protein in intracellular calcium metabolism rather than a direct involvement in membrane-mediated calcium reabsorption in the avian kidney."
https://openalex.org/W2081492374,"The serum of lactating rats that have never been infected with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma lewisi contains a rheumatoid factor-like immunoglobulin M (IgM). This IgM amplifies a specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) response to the parasite and accounts for the unusual resistance of previously uninfected lactating rats and their suckling pups to infection with T. lewisi. A similar rheumatoid factor-like IgM, which is induced late in the usual course of infection with T. lewisi in nonlactating rats, amplifies an earlier IgM response and terminates the infection. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a rheumatoid factor, which is classified as an autoimmune antibody, acting in a protective manner."

https://openalex.org/W1520911852,"A microdistillation procedure has been developed to analyze carboxylmethylation of the Mr = 60,000 chemoreceptor proteins involved in chemotaxis of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Methylation levels obtained by this method are substantially higher than those reported in the literature. In highly motile strains under optimal conditions there are approximately 100,000 methylated receptor residues per cell which are entirely composed of gamma-methylglutamyl esters. Whereas with previously used methods only groups which turn over could be detected, the microdistillation assay provides absolute values. Under steady state conditions, approximately one-half the total number of methyl ester residues are continuously hydrolyzed and resynthesized, while the remainder are sequestered. A mechanism has been devised to explain the observed patterns of methyl ester synthesis and hydrolysis. According to this hypothesis, substrate glutamyl residues on the receptor are located in a restricted region near the active sites of transferase and esterase which are bound to the receptor protein. Small, stimuli-induced changes in receptor conformation effect perturbations in receptor methylation by shifting the focus of activity of the modifying enzymes from one pair of closely spaced groups to another."
https://openalex.org/W2105066711,"The major coat protein of coliphage M13 is an integral protein of the E. coli plasma membrane prior to its assembly into new virus particles. It is generated from its precursor, procoat, by a membrane-bound leader peptidase. We now describe the reconstitution of a highly purified preparation of this enzyme into vesicles of E. coli phospholipids. These vesicles bind procoat made in vitro and procoat isolated from in vitro synthesis. Both the crude and the purified substrates were converted posttranslationally to coat protein. A significant proportion of the coat protein becomes inserted into the vesicle bilayer, with the N terminus facing the vesicle interior and the C terminus exposed to the external medium. These results strongly suggest that highly purified leader peptidase from E. coli and phospholipids are the only components necessary to mediate the binding, processing and insertion of this integral membrane protein."

https://openalex.org/W1991116548,"The methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) of Escherichia coli are integral membrane proteins that have been shown to undergo reversible methylation in response to the addition of attractants. We have shown that a second, rapid modification of MCPI and MCPII occurs, which is repellent-stimulated. This modification, which is not methylation, was detected because it causes a decrease in mobility of the MCPs on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels with a high acrylamide to bisacrylamide ratio. We have designated this modification as the CheB-modification, as it is dependent on the CheB gene product. The CheB-modification causes a decrease in the isoelectric point of MCPII by one or two charge groups. The CheB-modification is not necessary for the methylation, nor does it preclude methylation of the MCPs. Both the CheB-modified form and the unmodified, unmethylated forms of the MCPs are stable to treatment with base, which results in the hydrolysis of the methylesters (demethylation) of the MCPs. The potential role of CheB-modification in chemotaxis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1569794535,"We have isolated and characterized the 2 major proteins of a dense complex which accumulate in EScherichia coli cells infected with bacteriophage f1 under conditions where the phage gene V protein is inactive (Webster, R. E., and Rementer, M. (1980) J. Mol. Biol. 139, 393-405). The amino acid composition and NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences of the larger polypeptide (estimated molecular weight of 46,000) correspond to those predicted from the DNA sequence for the f1 gene II protein. The other polypeptide (estimated molecular weight of 14,000) has the amino acid composition and COOH-terminal sequence predicted for the f1 X protein, which previously had been found only as a product of an in vitro transcription-translation reaction. The X protein contains N-formylmethionine, cross-reacts with antibodies against gene II protein, and is present in wild type f1-infected bacteria. Thus, X protein is the product of f1 gene X (10), which is contained entirely in, and translated in phase with, gene II."
https://openalex.org/W2159945073,"The coat protein of coliphage M13 is an integral protein of the host-cell cytoplasmic membrane prior to its assembly into virions. It is initially synthesized as procoat, a soluble precursor with a 23 amino acid leader sequence at its amino terminus. 35S-labeled procoat accumulates during an in vitro translation reaction that contains 35S-methionine and RNA from M13-infected cells. Radiochemically pure procoat has been isolated from in vitro translation reactions by extraction into an organic solvent and gel filtration through Sephadex LH-60. Radiochemically pure procoat can be used as substrate in rapid and quantitative assays for leader peptidase and for leader peptide hydrolase, an enzyme that degrades the leader peptide after its release from procoat. Procoat solubility, digestion by leader peptidase and processing by membranes are affected by the presence of Mg2+ ion. Isolated procoat is soluble in water at low ionic strength and mildly alkaline pH as well as in detergent solutions. It is cleaved to coat protein by purified E. coli leader peptidase and by inverted E. coli inner-membrane vesicles. These properties of the purified procoat mirror those of the procoat in crude extracts. This suggests that there are no other soluble components that are necessary for the assembly of procoat into the membrane and its conversion to coat; specifically, it provides powerful evidence that protein synthesis is not involved."

https://openalex.org/W1489174618,"The orientation of the major coat (B) protein of the bacteriophage f1, an integral membrane protein in the cytoplasmic membrane of infected Escherichia coli, was examined. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and [3H]NaBH4 were used to label the cytoplasmic membrane proteins in spheroplasts and membrane vesicles of E. coli infected with bacteriophage f1. Under the conditions described, tritium incorporation was almost completely dependent on the presence of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and little if any of the cytoplasmic proteins were labeled when the reaction was applied to intact spheroplasts. The major coat protein was isolated from the cytoplasmic membranes labeled in this manner and the chymotryptic peptides were analyzed for the presence of tritium in the pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate conjugate. When the proteins were labeled in the intact spheroplast, only the NH2-terminal chymotryptic peptide of the coat protein was labeled. If the proteins were labeled during osmotic lysis of the spheroplasts or in isolated vesicles, the chymotryptic peptide containing the COOH terminus of the coat protein as well as the NH2-terminal peptide was labeled. The NH2-terminal peptide was labeled to approximately the same extent as occurred in the intact spheroplast. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the mature f1 coat protein asymmetrically spans the cytoplasmic membrane of the infected host with its NH2 terminus exposed on the outside and COOH terminus exposed on the cytoplasmic surface."

Histones extracted from mouse liver nuclei, analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, presented an extra band with the same mobility as chick erythrocyte H5. Electrophoretic blots on nitrocellulose paper were treated with anti-H5 or anti-H1 antibodies and iodinated protein A. The affinity purified anti-H5 bound to chicken H5 and mouse H1o fractions only. Anti-calf H1 bound to calf, chicken, and mouse H1 proteins and to mouse H1o as well. Antibodies to purified subfractions of rat thymus H1 showed binding to both H1 and H1o.

While the partition ratio (fluoride eliminated/total fluoride) was insensitive to pH 5.5-7.5 and concentrations of substrate and glyoxalase I, it was species-dependent. When [1-2H]fluoromethylglyoxal was reacted with glyoxalase I, an increase in the partition ratio and retention of deuterium in the product fluorolactate was observed. This result can only be explained by a selective primary isotope effect on the protonation of an enediol intermediate relative to fluoride elimination."
https://openalex.org/W1596998060,"Abstract 1. The synthesis described is of p-azidophenylglyoxal (p-APG) by diazotization of p-aminoacetophenone to an intermediate which when reacted with sodium azide gives p-azidoacetophenone; oxidation of the latter with selenium dioxide gives rise to p-APG (corrected melting point, 103-105 degrees C). The phenylglyoxal moiety was designed to react with arginine residues, whereas the p-azidoaryl function generates a reactive nitrene when activated with UV light; p-APG reacts most selectively with arginine and to a lesser extent with cystine and histidine. 2. p-APG has absorption peaks at 205 and 280 nm which decrease on photolysis. 3. Bovine heart lactic dehydrogenase, egg white lysozyme, horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, all enzymes having arginyl residues at their active sites, are inhibited by p-APG in the dark. 4.

https://openalex.org/W1573566253,"Cell-free preparations have been obtained from Escherichia coli AN 154 which catalyze the conversion of chorismic acid and alpha-ketoglutaric acid to o-succinylbenzoic acid. This result constitutes the first experimental verification of the committed step in menaquinone biosynthesis. The enzymatic biosynthesis of o-succinylbenzoic acid was demonstrated in experiments utilizing [U-14C]alpha-ketoglutaric acid as substrate. Following purification of O-succinylbenzoic acid and conversion to the dimethyl derivative, the presence of 14C was shown by scanning of thin layer chromatograms, and by radiogas chromatography. Proof for the formation of o-succinylbenzoic acid was also obtained by combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The formation of o-succinylbenzoic acid in these extracts required the presence of thiamin pyrophosphate; when this cofactor was omitted from the incubations, there was a substantial diminution in the incorporation of radioactivity from alpha-ketoglutarate into o-succinylbenzoic acid (from 4- to 8-fold). These results support the suggestion (Campbell, I. M. (1969) Tetrahedron Lett. 4777-4780) that the three-carbon unit of lawsone and, hence by inference, the four-carbon side chain of o-succinylbenzoic acid, is derived from the thiamin pyrophosphate adduct of succinic semialdehyde (likely in the anion form). The activated form of succinic semialdehyde is derived by the action of the first enzyme of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex or by a similar decarboxylase enzyme."

Specifically mistranslated ribosomal protein is also assembled into ribosomes in the same proportion that it is made. These results imply that the amino acid substitutions apparently made (lysine for asparagine or glutamine or histidine) do not lead to proteins recognized as grossly abnormal by the cell's proteolysis systems."
https://openalex.org/W1522518804,"Kinetic experiments (uptake versus time) were utilized to examine the effects of occupancy on insulin receptor availability in rat liver plasma membranes in vitro. The following observations were made: 1) at 4 degrees C, a 3-h exposure of membranes to 100 nM native insulin, followed by removal of unbound hormone, resulted in a subsequent decrease of 125I-insulin binding at 4 degrees C. In a similar experiment at 23 degrees C, no decrease of 125I-insulin binding was observed. 2) At 23 degrees C, 131I-insulin (5 nM) was bound to membranes in a slowly reversible manner after a 3-h association. After removal of free hormone, the 131I-insulin-treated membranes displayed similar binding of 125I-insulin (1 nM) relative to controls despite persistent high level occupancy of receptors by 131I-insulin. 3) At 23 degrees C, phospholipase pretreatment of membranes enhanced 125I-insulin uptake (approximately 40%). Phospholipase-digested membranes exposed to 100 nM native insulin for 3 h bound more 125I-insulin (approximately 40%) than did nondigested membranes preincubated without native insulin.

The substrate chorismate reduced the rate of inactivation. Analysis of inactivation data indicated that 1 arginine residue is essential for activity. Histidine residues in AS I were modified by ethoxyformic anhydride and by photooxidation. Enzyme inactivation accompanied modification of histidine residues. Inactivation was prevented by substrate. Comparison of the number of carbethoxy groups incorporated between substrate-protected and unprotected AS I indicated that 1 histidine residue is required for activity. AS I was also inactivated by bromopyruvate. Substrate retarded inactivation by bromopyruvate. A differential labeling experiment indicated that the loss of AS I activity was correlated with alkylation of 1 cysteine residue. A tryptic peptide containing the essential cysteine residue was isolated. The peptide has the amino acid sequence of Ile-Cys-Gln-Ala-Gly-Ser-Arg."

The banding pattern of sigma factor through a nondenaturing polyacrylamide slab gel was significantly altered in the presence of supercoiled DNA; sigma factor had little or no affinity to linear, double- or single-stranded DNA. At saturation, approximately one sigma factor was bound/200 base pairs of supercoiled pBR350 DNA. By the nitrocellulose filter trapping method, sigma factor was able to bind supercoiled pBRH4 DNA much more efficiently than linear double-stranded pBRH4 DNA.

We found that the degradation of linear duplex DNA was unaffected, but that the endonuclease and exonuclease activities for single-stranded DNA were inhibited by about 50% and 35%, respectively. In contrast, no protection of circular duplex DNA containing single-stranded regions was observed. The results suggest that the recA protein by itself may not act as a potent inhibitor of recBC enzyme-dependent DNA degradation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1568149859,"Cytoplasmic ribosomes and their large and small subunits have been isolated from the brine shrimp Artemia, and their basic physicochemical properties have been determined. From measurements of their ratio of absorbance at 260 and 280 nm, phosphorus and protein content, buoyant density in a CsCl gradient, and density increment, values have been derived for their RNA content (49, 52, and 43 +/- 2%, respectively), absorbance coefficient at 260 nm (12.1, 2.8, and 10.5, +/- 0.4 ml/mg, respectively), and partial specific volume (0.63, 0.62, and 0.65 +/- 0.002 ml/g, respectively). Analytical boundary sedimentation has yielded their standard sedimentation coefficient (81, 59, and 38, +/- 1 S, respectively). Photon correlation spectroscopy of laser light scattered from centrifuged solutions has yielded their translational diffusion coefficients (1.41 +/- 0.02, 1.61 +/- 0.03, and 1.80 +/- 0.04 X 10(-7) cm2/s, respectively). Combinations of these data have yielded values for their molecular weight (3.85 +/- 0.2, 2.45 +/- 0.2, and 1.45 +/- 0.1 X 10(6), respectively), for the total molecular weight of the free acid form of their RNA (1.9 +/- 0.1, 1.27 +/- 0.08, and 0.62 +/- 0.04 X 10(6), respectively) and of their proteins (2.0 +/- 0.1, 1.2 +/- 0.1, and 0.83 +/- 0.08 X 10(6), respectively), for their frictional coefficient ratio (1.54 +/- 0.04, 1.58 +/- 0.05, and 1.66 +/- 0.06, respectively), for their hydrodynamic and dry particle volume and radius, and for their hydrodynamic solvation. All the results are highly consistent. The various intact ribosomal particles of Artemia have nearly the same solvation (1.7 g/g); in this respect they resemble Escherichia coli ribosomal particles; this finding contrasts, however, with the few published data on eukaryotic ribosomes. This work strengthens the basis for a comparative study and for a more detailed elucidation of the structure of eukaryotic ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1520150880,"For two-substrate enymatic reactions isotope trapping has been used to demonstrate that an enzymesubstrate complex is functional in the crystalline state (Wilkinson, K. D., and Rose, I. A. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 7569-7574). Inability of a crystalline enzyme to catalyze the reaction of a bound substrate with a second reactant could arise from imperfections in the E=S complex, in which case the X-ray analysis would be misleading, or from incorrect juxtaposition of sites and limited mobility caused by lattice force restraints. An approach to the problem of further evaluating inactive crystalline enzyme-substrate complexes for relevance to functional states in solution is now presented based on the assumption that a functionally flawed E. S crystal will be derived from an inactive complex, presumably a minor species, that occurs in normal solution. In this case the catalytic properties of a normal solution and freshly dissolved E-S complex will differ at the moment of dissolution. The property used to demonstrate such a difference is the partition of bound radioactive substrate between product and free substrate by the isotope trapping method where measurements are made both with fully soluble E-S"
https://openalex.org/W163201459,"Four derivatives of the insuln B-chain COOH-terminal pentapeptide Arg-Gly-Phe-Phe-Tyr (B22-26) were synthesized and shown to be inactive alone. In the presence of submaximal concentrations of insulin or desoctapeptide insulin, peptides at concentrations of 10(-4) M and higher, markedly stimulated the actions of insulin on rat adipocytes including labeled glucose oxidation, activation of glycogen synthase, and stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose transport. The B-chain COOH-terminal heptapeptide, Gly-Phe-Phe-Tyr-Thr-Pro-Lys (B23-29) was inactive alone or in the presence of submaximal concentrations of insulin or desoctapeptide insulin, suggesting that argnine is required. Dose response curves of insulin, and desoctapeptide insulin for labeled glucose oxidation by rat adipocytes were shifted 1 log concentration unit to the left in the presence of peptide. Peptide shortened the lag time of labeled glucose oxidation and markedly enhanced the rate of 14CO2 production following the lag time. Peptides also enhanced insulin-like activities of concanavalin A and nonsuppressible insulin-like activity P."
