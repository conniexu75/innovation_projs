https://openalex.org/W3013504322,"A PAMless base editor CRISPR-Cas DNA base editing typically requires a specific motif for targeting known as a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). This requirement limits the sequences within a genome that can be targeted. Walton et al. engineered specific variants of the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 enzyme named SpG and SpRY that could recognize and edit a wider array of PAMs. Using SpRY, the authors were able to correct previously uneditable mutations associated with human disease. Although off-target effects were observed for these engineered Cas enzymes at levels similar to those of the wild-type enzyme, depending on the context, these engineered enzymes widen the potential applications of precision genome editing.

The ongoing pandemic of a new human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has generated enormous global concern. We and others in China were involved in the initial genome sequencing of the virus. Herein, we describe what genomic data reveal about the emergence SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the gaps in our understanding of its origins. The first reports of a novel pneumonia (COVID-19) in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, occurred in late December 2019, although retrospective analyses have identified a patient with symptom onset as early as December 1st. Because the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases is growing rapidly and spreading globally, we will refrain from citing the number of confirmed infections. However, it is likely that the true number of cases will be substantially greater than reported because very mild or asymptomatic infections will often be excluded from counts. Any under-reporting of case numbers obviously means that the case fatality rate (CFR) associated with COVID-19 in the worst-hit regions will be lower than that currently cited. CFRs will also vary geographically, between age groups and temporally. Although these uncertainties will likely not be resolved without large-scale serological surveys, from current data it is clear that the CFR for COVID-19 is substantially higher than that of seasonal influenza but lower than that of two closely related coronaviruses that have similarly recently emerged in humans: SARS-CoV, responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2002–2003, and MERS-CoV that since 2015 has been responsible for the ongoing outbreak of MERS largely centered on the Arabian peninsula. However, it is also evident that SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious than both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and that individuals can transmit the virus when asymptomatic or presymptomatic, although how frequently remains uncertain. An important early association was observed between the first reported cases of COVID-19 and the Huanan seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan city (which we both visited several years ago) where a variety of mammalian species were available for purchase at the time of the outbreak (Figure 1). Given that SARS-CoV-2 undoubtedly has a zoonotic origin, the link to such a “wet” market should come as no surprise. However, as not all of the early cases were market associated, it is possible that the emergence story is more complicated than first suspected. Genome sequences of “environmental samples”—likely surfaces—from the market have now been obtained, and phylogenetic analysis reveals that they are very closely related to viruses sampled from the earliest Wuhan patients. While this again suggests that the market played an important role in virus emergence, it is not clear whether the samples were derived from people who inadvertently deposited infectious material or from animals or animal matter present at that location. Unfortunately, the apparent lack of direct animal sampling in the market may mean that it will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to accurately identify any animal reservoir at this location. After clinical cases began to appear, our research team, along with a number of others, attempted to determine the genome sequence of the causative pathogen (Lu et al., 2020Lu R. Zhao X. Li J. Niu P.

We focused on a patient admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on December 26, 2019, six days after the onset of symptoms (Wu et al., 2020Wu F. Zhao S. Yu B. Chen Y.-M. Wang W. Song Z.G. Hu Y. Tao Z.W. Tian J.H. Pei Y.Y. et al.A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China.Nature. 2020; 579: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (7027) Google Scholar). This patient was experiencing fever, chest tightness, cough, pain, and weakness, along with lung abnormalities indicative of pneumonia that appear to be commonplace in COVID-19 (Huang et al., 2020Huang C. Wang Y. Li X. Ren L. Zhao J. Hu Y. Zhang L. Fan G. Xu J. Gu X. et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30845) Google Scholar). Fortunately, next-generation meta-transcriptomic sequencing enabled us to obtain a complete viral genome from this patient on January 5, 2020. Initial analysis revealed that the virus was closely related to those of SARS-like viruses (family Coronaviridae). This result was immediately reported to the relevant authorities, and an annotated version of the genome sequence (strain Wuhan-Hu-1) was submitted to NCBI/GenBank on the same day. Although the GenBank sequence (GenBank: MN908947) was the first of SARS-CoV-2 available, it was subsequently corrected to ensure its accuracy. With the help of Dr. Andrew Rambaut (University of Edinburgh), we released the genome sequence of the virus on the open access Virological website (http://virological.org/) early on January 11, 2020. Afterwards, the China CDC similarly released SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (with associated epidemiological data) on the public access GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/). At the time of writing, almost 200 SARS-CoV-2 genomes are publicly available, representing the genomic diversity of the virus in China and beyond and providing a freely accessible global resource. Importantly, the release of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data facilitated the rapid development of diagnostic tests (Corman et al., 2020Corman V.M. Landt O. Kaiser M. Molenkamp R. Meijer A. Chu D.K.W. Bleicker T. Brünink S. Schneider J.

Labroussaa F. Ebert N. V’kovski P. Stalder H. Portmann J. Kelly J. Steiner S. Holwerda M.

The race to develop an effective vaccine and antivirals is ongoing, with trails of the latter underway (Wang et al., 2020Wang Y. Zhou F. Zhang D. Zhao J. Du R. Hu Y. Cheng Z. Gao L. Jin Y. Luo G. et al.Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Intravenous Remdesivir in Adult Patients with Severe Pneumonia caused by COVID-19 virus infection: study protocol for a Phase 3 Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multicentre trial.BMC Trials. 2020; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.2.24058/v1Crossref Google Scholar). The earliest genomic genome sequence data made it clear that SARS-CoV-2 was a member of the genus Betacoronavirus and fell within a subgenus (Sarbecovirus) that includes SARS-CoV (MERS-CoV falls in a separate subgenus, Merbecovirus) (Lu et al., 2020Lu R.

Med. 2020; 382: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (17410) Google Scholar). Indeed, initial comparisons revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was approximately 79% similar to SARS-CoV at the nucleotide level. Of course, patterns of similarity vary greatly between genes, and SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit only ∼72% nucleotide sequence similarity in the spike (S) protein, the key surface glycoprotein that interacts with host cell receptors. Given these close evolutionary relationships, it is unsurprising that the genome structure of SARS-CoV-2 resembles those of other betacoronaviruses, with the gene order 5′-replicase ORF1ab-S-envelope(E)-membrane(M)-N-3′. The long replicase ORF1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2 is over 21 kb in length and contains 16 predicted non-structural proteins and a number of downstream open reading frames (ORFs) likely of similar function to those of SARS-CoV. Comparative genomic analysis has been greatly assisted by the availability of a related virus from a Rhinolophus affinis (i.e., horseshoe) bat sampled in Yunnan province, China, in 2013 (Zhou et al., 2020Zhou P. Yang X.L. Wang X.G. Hu B. Zhang L. Zhang W. Si H.R. Zhu Y. Li B. Huang C.L. et al.A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin.Nature. 2020; 579: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (13521) Google Scholar). This virus, denoted RaTG13, is ∼96% similar to SARS-CoV-2 at the nucleotide sequence level. Despite this sequence similarity, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 differ in a number of key genomic features, arguably the most important of which is that SARS-CoV-2 contains a polybasic (furin) cleavage site insertion (residues PRRA) at the junction of the S1 and S2 subunits of the S protein (Coutard et al., 2020Coutard B. Valle C. de Lamballerie X. Canard B. Seidah N.G. Decroly E. The spike glycoprotein of the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV contains a furin-like cleavage site absent in CoV of the same clade.Antiviral Res. 2020; 176: 104742Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). This insertion, which may increase the infectivity of the virus, is not present in related betacoronaviruses, although similar polybasic insertions are present in other human coronaviruses, including HCoV-HKU1, as well as in highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza virus. In addition, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are only ∼85% similar and share just one of six critical amino acid residues. Both sequence and structural comparisons suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is well suited for binding to the human ACE2 receptor that was also utilized by SARS-CoV (Wrapp et al., 2020Wrapp D. Wang N. Corbett K.S. Goldsmith J.A. Hsieh C.-L. Abiona O. Graham B.S. McLellan J.S. Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation.Science. 2020; 367: 1260-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Importantly, an independent insertion(s) of the amino acids PAA at the S1/S2 cleavage site was recently observed in a virus (RmYN02) sampled in mid-2019 from another Rhinolophus bat in Yunnan province, indicating that these insertion events reflect a natural part of ongoing coronavirus evolution (Zhou et al., 2020Zhou P. Yang X.L. Wang X.G. Hu B. Zhang L. Zhang W. Si H.R. Zhu Y. Li B. Huang C.L. et al.A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin.Nature. 2020; 579: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (13521) Google Scholar). While RmYN02 is relatively divergent from SARS-CoV-2 in the S protein (∼72% sequence similarity), it is the closest relative (∼97% nucleotide sequence similarity) of the human virus in the long replicase gene. Although SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are both closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and have bat reservoirs, the biological differences between these viruses are striking. As noted above, SARS-CoV-2 is markedly more infectious, resulting in very different epidemiological dynamics to those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In these latter two viruses, there was a relatively slow rise in case numbers, and MERS-CoV has never been able to fully adapt to human transmission: the majority of the cases are due to spillover from camels on the Arabian peninsula with only sporadic human-to-human transmission (Sabir et al., 2016Sabir J.S.M. Lam T.T.-Y. Ahmed M.M.A. Li L. Shen Y. Abo-Aba S.E.M. Qureshi M.I. Abu-Zeid M. Zhang Y. Khiyami M.A. et al.Co-circulation of three camel coronavirus species and recombination of MERS-CoVs in Saudi Arabia.Science. 2016; 351: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In contrast, the remarkable local and global spread of SARS-CoV-2 caught most by surprise. Determining the virological characteristics that underpin such transmissibility is clearly a priority. The emergence and rapid spread of COVID-19 signifies a perfect epidemiological storm. A respiratory pathogen of relatively high virulence from a virus family that has an unusual knack of jumping species boundaries, that emerged in a major population center and travel hub shortly before the biggest travel period of the year: the Chinese Spring Festival. Indeed, it is no surprise that epidemiological modeling suggests that SARS-CoV-2 had already spread widely in China before the city of Wuhan was placed under strict quarantine (Chinazzi et al., 2020Chinazzi M. Davis J.T. Ajelli M. Gioannini C. Litvinova M. Merler S. Pastore Y Piontti A. Mu K. Rossi L. Sun K. et al.The effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.Science. 2020; (eaba9757. Published online March 6, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aba9757Crossref PubMed Scopus (2117) Google Scholar). It was also no surprise that early genomic comparisons revealed that the most closely related viruses to SARS-CoV-2 came from bats (Zhou et al., 2020Zhou P. Yang X.L. Wang X.G. Hu B. Zhang L. Zhang W. Si H.R. Zhu Y. Li B. Huang C.L. et al.A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin.Nature. 2020; 579: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (13521) Google Scholar). Sampling in recent years has identified an impressive array of bat coronaviruses, including RaTG13 and RmYN02 (Hu et al., 2017Hu B. Zeng L.P. Yang X.L. Ge X.Y. Zhang W. Li B. Xie J.Z. Shen X.R. Zhang Y.Z. Wang N. et al.Discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus.PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13: e1006698Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 2015Yang X.L. Hu B. Wang B. Wang M.N. Zhang Q. Zhang W. Wu L.J. Ge X.Y. Zhang Y.Z. Daszak P. et al.Isolation and characterization of a novel bat coronavirus closely related to the direct progenitor of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus.J. Virol. 2015; 90: 3253-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Hence, bats are undoubtedly important reservoir species for a diverse range of coronaviruses (Cui et al., 2019Cui J. Li F. Shi Z.-L. Origin and evolution of pathogenic coronaviruses.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 17: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (3233) Google Scholar). Despite this, the exact role played by bats in the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not established. In particular, the bat viruses most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 were sampled from animals in Yunnan province, over 1,500 km from Wuhan. There are relatively few bat coronaviruses from Hubei province, and those that have been sequenced are relatively distant to SARS-CoV-2 in phylogenetic trees (Lin et al., 2017Lin X.-D. Wang W. Hao Z.-Y. Wang Z.-X. Guo W.-P. Guan X.-Q. Wang M.-R. Wang H.-W. Zhou R.-H. Li M.-H. et al.Extensive diversity of coronaviruses in bats from China.Virology. 2017; 507: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The simple inference from this is that our sampling of bat viruses is strongly biased toward some geographical locations. This will need to be rectified in future studies. In addition, although sequence similarity values of 96%–97% make it sound like the available bat viruses are very closely related to SARS-CoV-2, in reality this likely represents more than 20 years of sequence evolution (although the underlying molecular clock may tick at an uncertain rate if there was strong adaptive evolution of the virus in humans). It is therefore almost a certainty that more sampling will identify additional bat viruses that are even closer relatives of SARS-CoV-2. A key issue is whether these viruses, or those from any other animal species, contain the key RBD mutations and the same furin-like cleavage site insertion as found in SARS-CoV-2. Although bats are likely the reservoir hosts for this virus, their general ecological separation from humans makes it probable that other mammalian species act as “intermediate” or “amplifying” hosts, within which SARS-CoV-2 was able to acquire some or all of the mutations needed for efficient human transmission. In the case of SARS and MERS, civets and camels, respectively, played the role of intermediate hosts, although as MERS-CoV was likely present in camels for some decades before it emerged in humans during multiple cross-species events, these animals may be better thought of as true reservoir hosts (Sabir et al., 2016Sabir J.S.M. Lam T.T.-Y. Ahmed M.M.A. Li L. Shen Y. Abo-Aba S.E.M. Qureshi M.I. Abu-Zeid M. Zhang Y. Khiyami M.A. et al.Co-circulation of three camel coronavirus species and recombination of MERS-CoVs in Saudi Arabia.Science. 2016; 351: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To determine what these intermediate host species might be, it is imperative to perform a far wider sampling of animals from wet markets or that live close to human populations. This is highlighted by the recent discovery of viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) illegally imported into southern China (Guangdong and Guangxi provinces). The Guangdong pangolin viruses are particularly closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD, containing all six of the six key mutations thought to shape binding to the ACE2 receptor and exhibiting 97% amino acid sequence similarity (although they are more divergent from SARS-CoV-2 in the remainder of the genome). Although pangolins are of great interest because of how frequently they are involved in illegal trafficking and their endangered status, that they carry a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 strongly suggests that a far greater diversity of related betacoronaviruses exists in a variety of mammalian species but has yet to be sampled. While our past experience with coronaviruses suggests that evolution in animal hosts, both reservoirs and intermediates, is needed to explain the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, it cannot be excluded that the virus acquired some of its key mutations during a period of “cryptic” spread in humans prior to its first detection in December 2019. Specifically, it is possible that the virus emerged earlier in human populations than envisaged (perhaps not even in Wuhan) but was not detected because asymptomatic infections, those with mild respiratory symptoms, and even sporadic cases of pneumonia were not visible to the standard systems used for surveillance and pathogen identification. During this period of cryptic transmission, the virus could have gradually acquired the key mutations, perhaps including the RBD and furin cleavage site insertions, that enabled it to adapt fully to humans. It wasn’t until a cluster of pneumonia cases occurred that we were able to detect COVID-19 via the routine surveillance system. Obviously, retrospective serological or metagenomic studies of respiratory infection will go a long way to determining whether this scenario is correct, although such early cases may never be detected. Another issue that has received considerable attention is whether SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant virus, and whether such recombination might have facilitated its emergence (Lu et al., 2020Lu R. Zhao X. Li J. Niu P. Yang B. Wu H. Wang W. Song H. Huang B. Zhu N. et al.Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding.Lancet. 2020; 395: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7714) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2020Wu F. Zhao S. Yu B. Chen Y.-M. Wang W. Song Z.G. Hu Y. Tao Z.W. Tian J.H. Pei Y.Y. et al.A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China.Nature. 2020; 579: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (7027) Google Scholar). The complicating factor here is that sarbeviruses, and coronaviruses more broadly, experience widespread recombination, so that distinguishing recombination that assisted virus emergence from “background” recombination events is not trivial. Recombination is visible at multiple locations across the sarbevirus genome, including in the S protein, and in bat viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2. For example, there is some evidence for recombination among SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and the Guangdong pangolin CoVs (Lam et al., 2020Lam T.T.-Y. Shum M.H.-H. Zhu H.-C. Tong Y.-G. Ni X.-B. Liao Y.-S. Wei W. Cheung W.Y.-M. Li W.-J. Li L.-F. et al.Identification of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins in southern China.bioRxiv. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.13.945485Crossref Google Scholar), and the genome of RmYN02 has similarly been widely impacted by recombination (Zhou et al., 2020Zhou P. Yang X.L. Wang X.G. Hu B. Zhang L. Zhang W. Si H.R. Zhu Y. Li B. Huang C.L. et al.A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin.Nature. 2020; 579: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (13521) Google Scholar). However, trying to determine the exact pattern and genomic ancestry of recombination events is difficult, particularly as many of the recombinant regions may be small and are likely to change as we sample more viruses related to SARS-CoV-2. To resolve these issues, it will again be necessary to perform a far wider sampling of viral diversity in animal populations. As the COVID-19 epidemic has progressed, so more viral genomes have been sequenced. As expected given their recent common ancestry, the earliest samples from Wuhan contained relatively little genetic diversity. While this can prevent detailed phylogenetic and phylogeogaphic inferences, it does show that the public health authorities in Wuhan did a remarkable job in detecting the first cluster of pneumonia cases. However, this seemingly recent common ancestry does not exclude a pre-outbreak period of cryptic transmission in humans. Although accumulating genetic diversity means that it is now possible to detect distinct phylogenetic clusters of SARS-CoV-2 sequences, it is difficult to determine using genomic comparisons alone whether the virus is fixing phenotypically important mutations as it spreads through the global population, and any such claims require careful experimental verification. Given the high mutation rates that characterize RNA viruses, it is obvious that many more mutations will appear in the viral genome and that these will help us to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (Grubaugh et al., 2019Grubaugh N.D. Ladner J.T. Lemey P. Pybus O.G. Rambaut A. Holmes E.C. Andersen K.G. Tracking virus outbreaks in the twenty-first century.Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, as the epidemic grows, our sample size of sequences will likely be so small relative to the total number of cases that it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to detect individual transmission chains. Caution must therefore always be exercised when attempting to infer exact transmission events. As an aside, although coronaviruses likely have lower mutation rates than other RNA viruses because of an inherent capacity for some proof-reading activity due to a 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease (Minskaia et al., 2006Minskaia E. Hertzig T. Gorbalenya A.E. Campanacci V. Cambillau C. Canard B. Ziebuhr J. Discovery of an RNA virus 3′->5′ exoribonuclease that is critically involved in coronavirus RNA synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 5108-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), their long-term rates of nucleotide substitution (i.e., of molecular evolution) fall within the distribution of those seen in other RNA viruses (Holmes et al., 2016Holmes E.C. Dudas G. Rambaut A. Andersen K.G. The evolution of Ebola virus: Insights from the 2013-2016 epidemic.Nature. 2016; 538: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This suggests that lower mutation rates are to some extent compensated by high rates of virus replication within hosts. Although there is no evidence that this capacity to mutate (common to RNA viruses) will result in any radical changes in phenotype—such as in transmissibility and virulence—as these only rarely change at the scale of individual disease outbreaks (Grubaugh et al., 2020Grubaugh N.D. Petrone M.E. Holmes E.C. We shouldn’t worry when a virus mutates during disease outbreaks.Nat Microbiol. 2020; (Published online February 18, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-0690-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), it is obviously important to monitor any changes in phenotype as the virus spreads. In all likelihood, any drop in the number of cases and/or CFR of COVID-19 will likely be due to rising immunity in the human population and epidemiological context rather than mutational changes in the virus. It seems inevitable that SARS-CoV-2 will become the fifth endemic coronavirus in the human population (along with HKU1, NL63, OC43, and 229E) and one that is currently spreading in a totally susceptible population. Coronaviruses clearly have the capacity to jump species boundaries and adapt to new hosts, making it straightforward to predict that more will emerge in the future, although quite why coronaviruses possess this capacity in comparison to some other RNA viruses is unclear. Critically, the surveillance of animal coronaviruses should include animals other than bats, as the role of intermediate hosts is likely of major importance, providing a more direct pathway for the virus to emerge in humans. Given the enormous diversity of viruses in wildlife and their ongoing evolution, arguably the simplest and most cost-effective way to reduce the risk of future outbreaks is to limit our exposure to animal pathogens as much as possible. While our intimate relationship with the animal world means we cannot build impregnable barriers, stronger action against the illegal wildlife trade and removing all mammalian (and perhaps avian) wildlife from wet markets will provide an important buffer."

Using a quantitative framework, Watson et al. applied population genetic theory to estimate mutation accumulation in cells in blood from sequencing data derived from nearly 50,000 healthy individuals (see the Perspective by Curtis). By evaluating how mutations differ between blood cell populations, a phenomenon known as clonal hematopoiesis, the researchers could observe how recurrent mutations can drive certain clonal lineages to high frequencies within an individual. The risk of specific mutations, some of which are associated with leukemias, rising to high frequencies may therefore be a function of cellular selection and the age at which the mutation originated.

Using multi-unit recordings, we studied how face, head, arm, and leg movements are represented in the hand knob area of premotor cortex (precentral gyrus) in people with tetraplegia. Contrary to traditional expectations, we found strong representation of all movements and a partially “compositional” neural code that linked together all four limbs. The code consisted of (1) a limb-coding component representing the limb to be moved and (2) a movement-coding component where analogous movements from each limb (e.g., hand grasp and toe curl) were represented similarly. Compositional coding might facilitate skill transfer across limbs, and it provides a useful framework for thinking about how the motor system constructs movement. Finally, we leveraged these results to create a whole-body intracortical brain-computer interface that spreads targets across all limbs.

Finally, we leveraged these results to create a whole-body intracortical brain-computer interface that spreads targets across all limbs. Knowing how different body parts are topographically mapped onto the motor cortex is central to understanding the motor cortical system. Neural activity in the human motor cortex, including Brodmann area 4 (BA4) in the central sulcus and adjacent Brodmann area 6 (BA6) on the precentral gyrus, is traditionally thought to have macroscopic somatotopy. In this view, face, arm, and leg movements are represented in distinct areas of the cortex, but individual muscles within any one body area may be mixed (e.g., wrist and finger movements may overlap within the arm area) (Schieber, 2001Schieber M.H. Constraints on somatotopic organization in the primary motor cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 2125-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Classical stimulation studies in great apes and humans suggest an orderly arrangement of body parts along the precentral gyrus, with little intermixing between face, arm, and leg within any one individual (Leyton and Sherrington, 1917Leyton A.S.F.

Nevertheless, the level of mixed representation within any one area of the human precentral gyrus has not yet been quantified at single-neuron resolution. Here we revisit motor somatotopy using microelectrode array recordings from the hand knob area of precentral gyrus (Yousry et al., 1997Yousry T.A. Schmid U.D. Alkadhi H. Schmidt D. Peraud A.

A new landmark.Brain. 1997; 120: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar) while two participants in the BrainGate2 pilot clinical trial made (or attempted) a variety of face, head, leg, and arm movements. Surprisingly, we found strong neural tuning to all tested movements, contradicting traditional views of human motor cortical organization. In light of this new evidence of intermixed whole-body tuning, combined with prior anatomical evidence that places the dorsal precentral gyrus in BA6 and links it to the macaque dorsal premotor cortex (area PMd) (e.g., White et al., 1997White L.E. Andrews T.J. Hulette C. Richards A. Groelle M. Paydarfar J. Purves D. Structure of the human sensorimotor system. I: Morphology and cytoarchitecture of the central sulcus.Cereb.

Neurophysiol. 1998; 106: 283-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), we refer to the human precentral gyrus as premotor cortex in this manuscript (see Discussion for more details). Our finding of whole-body tuning in human premotor cortex presents a unique opportunity to investigate how each body part is neurally coded in relation to the others, which could shed light on its functional role. It also presents an opportunity to improve brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) by enabling whole-body decoding from microelectrode arrays in a single brain area. Along these lines, this manuscript is structured into three parts: (1) demonstrating tuning to the whole body in the hand area of premotor cortex, (2) building on this finding to investigate the structure of the neural code for the whole body, and (3) translating this finding to BCIs to help people with paralysis. Prior work in humans and macaques set some expectations for how different body parts might be neurally coded in relation to each other. Previous fMRI and ECoG studies of the human precentral gyrus found that matching movements of the ipsilateral and contralateral arms have similar (correlated) neural representations (Diedrichsen et al., 2013Diedrichsen J.

Macaque studies also show a correlated representation of ipsilateral and contralateral reaching movements (Cisek et al., 2003Cisek P. Crammond D.J. Kalaska J.F. Neural activity in primary motor and dorsal premotor cortex in reaching tasks with the contralateral versus ipsilateral arm.J.

Cortical representation of bimanual movements.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11577-11586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we study not only how ipsilateral and contralateral arm movements are related but also how leg movements are related to arm movements. Examining all four limbs together reveals a “compositional” neural code that links homologous movements of different limbs (e.g., links wrist movements to ankle movements as well as ipsilateral wrist movements to contralateral ones). The compositional code has a two-part structure where movements are coded in partial independence of the limb to be moved. One potential function of such a representation is to enable transfer of motor skills between different limbs (as shown in Kelso and Zanone, 2002Kelso J.A. Zanone P.G.

The coding and inter-manual transfer of movement sequences.Front. Psychol. 2011; 2: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); a motor skill could be learned in movement-coding components of the neural activity and then transferred to another limb by changing only the limb-coding component. We call the code compositional because the limb and movement components are “composed” (summed together) to specify the motor action. Recently, compositionality has also been suggested to underlie the representation of task rules in prefrontal areas (Reverberi et al., 2012Reverberi C. Görgen K. Haynes J.-D.

In the last part of the manuscript, we demonstrate a discrete intracortical BCI that decodes movements across all four limbs from only a single brain area. We show that this whole-body BCI improves information throughput relative to a single-effector approach. This result substantially opens up the space of what intracortical BCIs can do and explore because current systems are limited to placing microelectrodes in only a few brain areas (e.g., Hochberg et al., 2012Hochberg L.R.

We used microelectrode array recordings from participants T5 and T7 to assess tuning to attempted movements of the face (mouth, tongue, facial muscles, and speaking), head (head turning and tilting), contralateral arm (shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers), and contralateral leg (hip, knee, ankle, and toes) in the hand knob area of precentral gyrus. Participant T5 had a C4 spinal cord injury and was paralyzed from the neck down; he could move his face and head, but most attempted arm and leg movements resulted in little or no motion. Participant T7 had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and could move all joints tested, although some of his arm movements were limited because of weakness (see Table S2 for neurological exam results). In this experiment, T5 and T7 made (or attempted to make) movements in sync with visual cues displayed on a computer screen (Figure 1A). T5 completed an instructed delay version of the task where each trial randomly cued one of 32 possible movements spanning the face, head, arm, and legs. For face and head movements, T5 was instructed to move normally; for arm and leg movements, T5 was instructed to attempt to move as if he were not paralyzed. T7, whose more limited data were collected earlier in a different study (and who is no longer enrolled), completed an alternating paired movement task with a block design. Each block tested a different movement pair during which T7 alternated between making each of the paired movements every 3 s. (A) Neural activity was recorded while participants T5 and T7 completed cued movement tasks that instructed them to make (or attempt to make) movements of the face, head, arm, and leg in sync with text appearing on a computer monitor. (B) Participants’ MRI-derived brain anatomy and microelectrode array locations. Microelectrode array locations were determined by co-registration of postoperative computed tomography (CT) images with preoperative MRI images. (C) The mean firing rate recorded for each cued movement is shown for an example electrode from participant T5. Shaded regions indicate 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Neural activity was denoised by convolving with a Gaussian smoothing kernel (30-ms SD). (D) The size of the neural modulation for each movement was quantified by comparison with a baseline “do nothing” condition (in participant T5) or by comparison with its paired movement (T7). Each bar indicates the size (Euclidean norm) of the mean change in firing rate across the neural population (with a 95% CI). Each dot corresponds to the cross-validated projection of a single trial’s firing rate vector onto the “difference” axis. For T5, light dots represent the “do nothing” condition, and dark dots represent the given movement. For T7, dark and light dots represent different movements of the given pair. Statistically significant modulation was observed for all movements (no confidence intervals contain 0). Translucent horizontal bars indicate the mean bar height for each movement type. (E) A Gaussian naive Bayes classifier was used to classify each trial’s movement using the firing rate in a window from 200–600 ms (T5) or 200–1,600 ms (T7) after the go cue. Confusion matrices are shown from offline cross-validated performance results; each entry (i, j) in the matrix is colored according to the percentage of trials where movement j was decoded (of all trials where movement i was cued). Despite recording from microelectrode arrays placed in the hand knob region of precentral gyrus (Figure 1B), we found strong neural tuning to all tested movements, including those of the face, head, and leg. Figure 1C shows an example electrode from T5 that was tuned to all movement categories. Here, and in most other results, we analyzed binned threshold crossing rates (i.e., multi-unit “firing rates”) for each microelectrode (although Figure S3, mentioned below, reports single-unit results). Analyzing multi-unit threshold crossings allowed us to leverage information from more electrodes because many electrodes recorded activity from multiple neurons that could not be precisely distinguished. Recent results indicate that neural population structure can be accurately estimated from threshold crossing rates alone (Trautmann et al., 2019Trautmann E.M. Stavisky S.D. Lahiri S. Ames K.C. Kaufman M.T. O’Shea D.J. Vyas S. Sun X. Ryu S.I. Ganguli S. Shenoy K.V. Accurate Estimation of Neural Population Dynamics without Spike Sorting.Neuron. 2019; 103: 292-308.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Binned threshold crossing rates were Z-scored by subtracting the mean firing rate and dividing by the bin-by-bin standard deviation of the firing rate (and are reported in units of standard deviation [SD]). In Figure 1D, we summarize the population-level neural modulation observed for each individual movement (T5) or pair of movements (T7) across all microelectrodes. For participant T5, we quantified modulation size by computing the magnitude (Euclidean norm) of the difference between mean firing rates observed during a “do nothing” control condition and mean rates observed during the movement of interest. Modulation size was estimated in a cross-validated way to reduce bias (STAR Methods). For participant T7, we computed the difference between the mean rates observed for each pair of movements. Mean rates were computed for each trial in a time window 200–600 ms after the go cue (T5) or 200–1,600 ms after the go cue (T7). Figure 1D shows robust modulation for each tested movement in both participants (the clusters of single-trial firing rates are clearly separable, and the confidence intervals are far from zero). Tuning to arm movement was the strongest in both participants (p < 1e−3; STAR Methods), with tuning to non-arm movements 38% (face), 46% (head), and 61% (leg) as large as arm movement tuning in T5 and 38% (face), 34% (head), and 53% (leg) as large in T7. Next we tested whether each movement was neurally distinguishable from other movements by using a cross-validated naive Bayes classifier to decode the movement on each trial. High classification accuracies (Figure 1E) confirm that tuning to each movement was unique and separable (as opposed to being caused by a generic signal that was the same for all movements). In Figure S1, we plot the neural activity in the top neural dimensions found using principal-component analysis (PCA) to illustrate that activity is rich and multi-dimensional for all movement types. Each subpanel shows the neural activity in one neural dimension found using PCA (using the data shown in Figure 1). Each line in a panel shows the mean response to a given movement cue and shaded regions depict 95% confidence intervals. Within each column (movement set) only the neural responses for the movement cues within that set are shown (for ease of visualization). Results show that there is distinguishable neural activity (non-overlapping confidence intervals) between movements for all four movement sets and both participants. This holds true for all three neural dimensions, indicating that the movement-specific activity is strongly multi-dimensional. Note that, unlike T5, T7 performed a set of periodic paired movements (e.g., open hand, close hand, open hand, etc.). The vertical dashed lines for T7 show the paired movement “switch” time. Finally, we searched for somatotopy across the microelectrode arrays and saw no clear patterns; tuning to all four movement types was highly intermixed, and many electrodes were tuned to multiple movement types (Figure S2). We also analyzed well-isolated, spike-sorted single neurons and found that they were frequently tuned to multiple movement types as well (Figure S3). In Figures S2 and S3, we also report firing rate statistics in raw units of Hz. (A) The strength of each electrodes’ tuning to each category of movements is indicated with a shaded color (darker colors indicate more tuning). Tuning strength was quantified by computing the fraction of total firing rate variance accounted for by changes in firing rate due to the movement conditions. Crosses indicate “non-functioning” electrodes (mean firing rate < 1 Hz). Small white circles indicate channels that had no significant tuning to that movement category. Broad spatial tuning to all movement categories can be seen across all arrays. Additionally, tuning strength to particular movement categories does not appear to have clear gradients matching the expected somatotopy (where face, head, arm and leg tuning should proceed laterally to medially in that order), with the possible exception of leg tuning in T7. (B) Matrices indicating whether an electrode was significantly tuned to each individual movement. A colored cell within a matrix (i,j) indicates significant tuning of electrode channel i to movement j. The cell color corresponds to the associated movement category. x axis labels have been limited to the movement set names for brevity. For T5, significant tuning was assessed by comparing the firing rates for each movement against the “Do Nothing” condition. For T7, significant tuning was assessed by comparing movements within each movement pair. P values < 0.001 were considered significant. For visualization, rows were re-ordered according to a clustering analysis (black horizontal bars indicate cluster ranges). (C) Bar plots indicate the number of electrodes that were significantly tuned to each movement category as computed in A. Results show a greater preference for arm tuning in T7 as compared to T5. (D) Pie charts summarize the number of electrodes that had statistically significant tuning to each possible number of movement sets (from 0 to 4). In both participants, many electrodes are tuned to more than one movement set. (E) Scatterplots indicate the mean absolute change in firing rate of each electrode for two movement sets. In both participants (T5 in top row, T7 in bottom row), most electrodes showed a greater mean change in firing rate for movements within the Arm movement class in comparison to other (Face, Head, Leg) movement classes. T5′s change in firing rates were computed relative to the “Do Nothing” condition serving as a point of comparison. T7’s change in firing rates were computed by comparing to each cued movement’s paired movement. (F) Histograms indicate the baseline firing rate measured on each electrode channel. For T5, baseline is defined as the “Do Nothing” condition. For T7, baseline firing rates were computed by taking the mean firing rate across all time bins and across all paired movements cued. (A) PSTHs for two example sorted units from participant T5. Lines show the mean firing rate and shaded regions indicate 95% CIs of the mean (computed by assuming the data is normally distributed). The responses show broad tuning to a variety of movements across the body. (B) PSTHs for an example sorted unit from T7. Unlike T5, T7 performed a set of periodic paired movements (e.g., open hand, close hand, open hand, etc.). The vertical dashed lines show the paired movement “switch” time. Since these data were collected in a block-wise fashion (with each block testing a different movement pair), we plotted each pair separately for ease of visualization. This particular unit is strongly tuned to both the arm and the leg. (C) Matrices indicating whether a single unit was significantly tuned to each movement (computed as in Figure S2). (D) Bar plots indicate the number of units that were significantly tuned to each movement set. (determined as in Figure S2). (E) Pie charts summarize the number of single units that had statistically significant tuning to each possible number of movement sets (from 0 to 4). Most of T5′s sorted units modulated significantly to all four sets of movements, whereas most of T7’s sorted units had significant modulation to one or two sets of movements. This difference might be due in part to the fact that more movements were tested in T5 (especially non-arm movements) and more trials were collected (32 versus 18 per movement). (F) Scatterplots indicate the mean absolute change in firing rate of each sorted unit for each movement set, computed as in Figure S2. (G) Histograms indicate the baseline firing rate measured on each sorted unit, computed as in Figure S2 Next we assessed tuning to ipsilateral attempted arm and leg movements in participant T5 (Figure 2). Our remaining results (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) are based on data from T5, who is currently enrolled in the trial. Figure 2 shows that firing rates changed two-thirds as much for ipsilateral movement compared with contralateral movement (65% as much for the arm, 78% as much for the leg). Tuning to ipsilateral movements was separable and robust. A cross-validated naive Bayes classifier could decode movements with 97.4% accuracy (among all movements shown in Figure 2) using a 200- to 600-ms window after the go cue. The size of the neural modulation for each attempted movement was quantified by comparison with a baseline “do nothing” condition. Each bar indicates the size (Euclidean norm) of the mean change in neural population activity (with a 95% CI), and each dot corresponds to the cross-validated projection of a single trial’s neural activity onto the difference axis. Translucent horizontal bars indicate the mean bar height for each attempted movement type. (A) To reveal how ipsilateral and contralateral movements are represented in relation to each other, dPCA was applied to a set of four example attempted arm movements (taken from the dataset shown in Figure 2). Each panel shows the mean activity for a single dimension, and each column shows dimensions related to a particular factor (marginalization). Each trace shows the mean activity for a single condition, and the shaded regions indicate 95% CIs. The percent variance explained by each dimension is indicated at the top left. (B) The mean activity through time in the first two movement dimensions is plotted as a trajectory for each condition. The dashed lines lie mostly near the solid lines and travel in the same direction, indicating that activity for a given movement is similar across sides of the body. (A) A cross-validation analysis demonstrates the existence of neural dimensions that code for laterality (left versus right side of the body) and effector (arm versus leg).

Reichardt et al. found that a small signaling peptide hormone, phytosulfokine, which was previously known for its ability to regulate plant cell growth, also drives fruit abscission. Processed, and thus activated, by a subtilisin-like protease, phytosulfokine in turn drives expression of the hydrolases that degrade the cell walls in the abscission zone, leading to dropped fruit.

Kang et al. determined a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the active complex formed by ribonucleotide reductase that allows for PCET between two protein subunits over a total distance of ∼35 angstroms. Several interventions that stabilized the radical en route also stabilized the complex and allowed for visualization of the interface between the two subunits and the full network of residues that permit PCET.

Models indicate that sulfate aerosols resulting from large eruptions can initiate an El Niño–like response in the tropical Pacific, but observations have not shown evidence of such behavior. Dee et al . present an oxygen-isotope time series of fossil corals from the central tropical Pacific to investigate ENSO's response to large volcanic eruptions during the past millennium. They found a weak tendency for an El Niño–like response in the year after an eruption, but not one that was statistically significant. These results suggest that large volcanic events have not triggered a detectable response in ENSO over the past thousand years and that their impact is small relative to the degree of natural variability.

https://openalex.org/W3103882769,"Observations of nearby galaxies and galaxy clusters have reported an unexpected X-ray emission line around 3.5 kilo-electron volts (keV). Proposals to explain this line include decaying dark matter$-$in particular, that the decay of sterile neutrinos with a mass around 7 keV could match the available data. If this interpretation is correct, the 3.5 keV line should also be emitted by dark matter in the halo of the Milky Way. We used more than 30 megaseconds of XMM-Newton (X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission) blank-sky observations to test this hypothesis, finding no evidence of the 3.5-keV line emission from the Milky Way halo. We set an upper limit on the decay rate of dark matter in this mass range, which is inconsistent with the possibility that the 3.5-keV line originates from dark matter decay."

The asymptotic momentum distribution after expansion in 1D is the distribution of rapidities, which are the conserved quantities associated with many-body integrable systems. Rapidities have not previously been measured in any interacting many-body quantum system. Our measurements agree well with T-G gas theory. We also study momentum evolution after the trap depth is suddenly changed to a new non-zero value. We observe the predicted bosonic-fermionic oscillations and see deviations from the theory outside of the T-G gas limit."

Usually, the samples are formed of ensembles, and this can limit the resolution with which the different species can be detected or identified. Chou et al. demonstrate an optical frequency comb technique with a single pair of trapped ions, Ca + and CaH + , to obtain the rotational spectrum of a single trapped ion, CaH + . With the ions isolated and the ensemble interactions removed, the rotational structure of the trapped molecular ion can then be obtained with high precision. As the trapping and manipulation process is general, this technique could be applied to a number of chemical species for specific purposes. Science , this issue p. 1458"

There are no pharmacological therapies to treat AAA. We tested the hypothesis that nanoparticle (NP) therapy that targets degraded elastin and delivers anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and ECM stabilizing agent, pentagalloyl glucose (PGG) will reverse advance stage aneurysm in an elastase-induced mouse model of AAA.Porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) was applied periadventitially to the infrarenal aorta in mice and AAA was allowed to develop for 14 days. Nanoparticles loaded with PGG (EL-PGG-NPs) were then delivered via IV route at 14-day and 21-day (10 mg/kg of body weight). A control group of mice received no therapy. The targeting of NPs to the AAA site was confirmed with fluorescent dye marked NPs and gold NPs. Animals were sacrificed at 28-d. We found that targeted PGG therapy reversed the AAA by decreasing matrix metalloproteinases MMP-9 and MMP-2, and the infiltration of macrophages in the medial layer. The increase in diameter of the aorta was reversed to healthy controls. Moreover, PGG treatment restored degraded elastic lamina and increased the circumferential strain of aneurysmal aorta to the healthy levels.Our results support that site-specific delivery of PGG with targeted nanoparticles can be used to treat already developed AAA. Such therapy can reverse inflammatory markers and restore arterial homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3013370603,"Vasopressin regulates renal water excretion by binding to a Gα s-coupled receptor (V2R) in collecting duct cells, resulting in increased water permeability through regulation of the aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channel. This action is widely accepted to be associated with cAMP-mediated activation of protein kinase A (PKA). Here, we use phosphoproteomics in collecting duct cells in which PKA has been deleted (CRISPR-Cas9) to identify PKA-independent responses to vasopressin. The results show that V2R-mediated vasopressin signaling is predominantly, but not entirely, PKA-dependent. Upregulated sites in PKA-null cells include Ser256 of AQP2, which is critical to regulation of AQP2 trafficking. In addition, phosphorylation changes in the protein kinases Stk39 (SPAK) and Prkci (an atypical PKC) are consistent with PKA-independent regulation of these protein kinases. Target motif analysis of the phosphopeptides increased in PKA-null cells indicates that vasopressin activates one or more members of the AMPK/SNF1-subfamily of basophilic protein kinases. In vitro phosphorylation assays using recombinant, purified SNF1-subfamily kinases confirmed postulated target specificities. Of interest, measured IBMX-dependent cAMP levels were an order of magnitude higher in PKA-null than in PKA-intact cells, indicative of a PKA-dependent feedback mechanism. Overall, the findings support the conclusion that V2-receptor mediated signaling in collecting duct cells is in part PKA-independent."
https://openalex.org/W3013958660,"Background To estimate the potential gain in life expectancy from addressing modifiable risk factors for all-cause mortality (excluding suicide and deaths from accidents or violence) across specific serious mental illness (SMI) subgroups, namely schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, and bipolar disorders in a Western population. Methods We have used relative risks from recent meta-analyses to estimate the population attribution fraction (PAF) due to specific modifiable risk factors known to be associated with all-cause mortality within SMI. The potential gain in life expectancy at birth, age 50 and age 65 years were assessed by estimating the combined effect of modifiable risk factors from different contextual levels (behavioural, healthcare, social) and accounting for the effectiveness of existing interventions tackling these factors. Projections for annual gain in life expectancy at birth during a two-decade was estimated using the Annual Percentage Change (APC) formula. The predicted estimates were based on mortality rates for year 2014–2015. Results Based on the effectiveness of existing interventions targeting these modifiable risk factors, we estimated potential gain in life expectancy at birth of four (bipolar disorders), six (schizoaffective disorders), or seven years (schizophrenia). The gain in life expectancy at age 50 years was three (bipolar disorders) or five (schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders) years. The projected gain in life expectancy at age 65 years was three (bipolar disorders) or four (schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders) years. Conclusions The implementation of existing interventions targeting modifiable risk factors could narrow the current mortality gap between the general and the SMI populations by 24% (men) to 28% (women). These projections represent ideal circumstances and without the limitation of overestimation which often comes with PAFs."
https://openalex.org/W3013978789,"Non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) is the most prevalent musculoskeletal condition in western countries and is associated with persistent disability and high consumption of health care resources. NSLBP patients first seek primary health care services but the outcomes are often uncertain. This study aimed to examine the clinical course of the outcomes and to identify prognostic indicators for poor outcomes in NSLBP patients who consulted primary care.A prospective cohort study of 115 patients seeking treatment for NSLBP in primary care was conducted. Participants were consecutively recruited by their General Practitioners (GPs) and then assessed at baseline and 2 and 6 months later. Baseline assessment included socio-demographic and clinical data, psychosocial factors, pain, disability, and health related quality of life (HRQoL). Pain, disability, HRQoL and global perception of change were also assessed at 2 and 6-months' follow-up. In addition, information regarding the GP' practice was collected. Poor outcomes were determined according to the cut-off point used to define a persistent disabling condition and the minimal important change established for disability, pain and for global perception of change. The relationship between variables on baseline and poor outcomes was modulated through binary logistic regression analysis. The significance of associations was evaluated at ≤ 0.05 p-value with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR).110 (94.8%) and 104 (89.7%) participants completed the follow-up assessment at 2 and 6 months, respectively. The mean age (±SD) was 48.06 ± 11.41, with 53.9%, (N = 62) reporting an acute presentation of NSLBP. Six months after GP consultation, 53.8% (N = 56) of the participants reported a persistent disabling condition.

Besides these factors, being employed reduces the chances of poor outcomes on disability [AOR 0.31; 95% CI (0.11, 0.92)].A large proportion of LBP patients seeking primary health care reported poor outcomes 6 months after GP consultation. Patients who report chronic LBP, maladaptive psychosocial factors and are unemployed have a significant increase in the risk of poor outcome.

https://openalex.org/W3014010068,"Despite the diversity in fish auditory structures, it remains elusive how otolith morphology and swim bladder-inner ear (= otophysic) connections affect otolith motion and inner ear stimulation. A recent study visualized sound-induced otolith motion; but tank acoustics revealed a complex mixture of sound pressure and particle motion. To separate sound pressure and sound-induced particle motion, we constructed a transparent standing wave tube-like tank equipped with an inertial shaker at each end while using X-ray phase contrast imaging. Driving the shakers in phase resulted in maximised sound pressure at the tank centre, whereas particle motion was maximised when shakers were driven out of phase (180°). We studied the effects of two types of otophysic connections-i.e. the Weberian apparatus (Carassius auratus) and anterior swim bladder extensions contacting the inner ears (Etroplus canarensis)-on otolith motion when fish were subjected to a 200 Hz stimulus. Saccular otolith motion was more pronounced when the swim bladder walls oscillated under the maximised sound pressure condition. The otolith motion patterns mainly matched the orientation patterns of ciliary bundles on the sensory epithelia. Our setup enabled the characterization of the interplay between the auditory structures and provided first experimental evidence of how different types of otophysic connections affect otolith motion."
https://openalex.org/W3013037670,"There is an urgent need to develop climate smart agroecosystems capable of mitigating climate change and adapting to its effects. In California, high commodity prices and increased frequency of drought have encouraged orchard turnover, providing an opportunity to recycle tree biomass in situ prior to replanting an orchard. Whole orchard recycling (WOR) has potential as a carbon (C) negative cultural practice to build soil C storage, soil health, and orchard productivity. We tested the potential of this practice for long term C sequestration and hypothesized that associated co-benefits to soil health will enhance sustainability and resiliency of almond orchards to water-deficit conditions. We measured soil health metrics and productivity of an almond orchard following grinding and incorporation of woody biomass vs. burning of old orchard biomass 9 years after implementation. We also conducted a deficit irrigation trial with control and deficit irrigation (-20%) treatments to quantify shifts in tree water status and resilience. Biomass recycling led to higher yields and substantial improvement in soil functioning, including nutrient content, aggregation, porosity, and water retention. This practice also sequestered significantly higher levels of C in the topsoil (+5 t ha-1) compared to burning. We measured a 20% increase in irrigation water use efficiency and improved soil and tree water status under stress, suggesting that in situ biomass recycling can be considered as a climate smart practice in California irrigated almond systems."

The presence of a significant amount of harassment in user-generated content and its negative impact calls for robust automatic detection approaches. This requires the identification of different types of harassment. Earlier work has classified harassing language in terms of hurtfulness, abusiveness, sentiment, and profanity. However, to identify and understand harassment more accurately, it is essential to determine the contextual type that captures the interrelated conditions in which harassing language occurs. In this paper we introduce the notion of contextual type in harassment by distinguishing between five contextual types: (i) sexual, (ii) racial, (iii) appearance-related, (iv) intellectual and (v) political. We utilize an annotated corpus from Twitter distinguishing these types of harassment. We study the context of each kind to shed light on the linguistic meaning, interpretation, and distribution, with results from two lines of investigation: an extensive linguistic analysis, and the statistical distribution of uni-grams. We then build type- aware classifiers to automate the identification of type-specific harassment. Our experiments demonstrate that these classifiers provide competitive accuracy for identifying and analyzing harassment on social media. We present extensive discussion and significant observations about the effectiveness of type-aware classifiers using a detailed comparison setup, providing insight into the role of type-dependent features."

Mushroom metabolism is regulated by the mycelia and fruit body using light; however, in mushrooms, the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling this process as well as light-induced gene expression remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, we compared morphological changes and gene expression in the fruit bodies of L. edodes cultivated under blue light and continuous darkness. Our results showed that blue light primarily induced pileus growth (diameter and thickness) compared to dark cultivation. Alternatively, stipe length development was promoted by dark cultivation. We also performed RNAseq on L. edodes under the blue light/dark cultivation conditions. A total of 12,051 genes were used for aligning the Illumina raw reads and 762 genes that showed fold change cut-offs of >|2| and significance p-values of <0.05 were selected under blue light condition. Among the genes which showed two-fold changed genes, 221 were upregulated and 541 were downregulated. In order to identify blue light induced candidate genes, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected according to 4-fold changes and validated by RT-PCR. We identified 8 upregulated genes under blue light condition, such as DDR48-heat shock protein, Fasciclin-domain-containing protein and carbohydrate esterase family 4 protein, FAD NAD-binding domain-containing protein that are involved in morphological development of primordium and embryonic muscle development, cell adhesion and affect the structure of cellulosic and non-cellulosic cell walls of fruit body development, and photoreceptor of blue light signaling for fruit body and pigment development, respectively. This study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of blue light in mushroom growth and development and can thus contribute to breeding programs to improve mushroom cultivation."
https://openalex.org/W3013260597,"Melatonin (MEL) can act as a plant growth regulator and biostimulator in stressful situations. Using MEL in seed pretreatment also affects the future growth of plants. Therefore, this research investigated the effects of MEL on seed germination and seedling growth under NaCl in in vitro conditions. The additional effects of MEL on the accumulation of steviol glycosides (SGs) and on the expression of appropriate genes were also studied. Five μM of MEL was the best concentration for seed germination, while 20 μM exerted a positive impact on the biomass of stevia plantlets. NaCl significantly decreased seed germination, but MEL alleviated this effect when seeds were germinated in 50 mM of NaCl. Under salinity, the values of almost all morphological traits decreased as MEL concentration increased. The highest amounts of stevioside and rebaudioside A (Reb A) were observed as a result of treating seeds with 5 and 20 μM of MEL, respectively. When adding NaCl, positive impacts of MEL on the accumulation of both SGs were also observed. Expression analyses of the genes involved in SGs biosynthesis was explored in seeds and leaves, and the transcripts of key enzymes occurred in both the tissues. However, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis showed that all tested genes were upregulated in younger leaves, contrary to older ones. Also in younger, rather than older, leaves SG gene expression varied according to MEL concentration. This study, therefore, presents the promising potential of MEL for improving stevia seed germination under salinity conditions and for enhancing the production of SGs in stevia plants."

Despite this long time in use, significant questions remain regarding how best to optimize TMZ therapy for individual patients. Understanding the relationship between TMZ response and factors such as number of adjuvant TMZ cycles, patient age, patient sex, and image-based tumor features, might help predict which GBM patients would benefit most from TMZ, particularly for those whose tumors lack O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation.Using a cohort of 90 newly-diagnosed GBM patients treated according to the standard of care, we examined the relationships between several patient and tumor characteristics and volumetric and survival outcomes during adjuvant chemotherapy. Volumetric changes in MR imaging abnormalities during adjuvant therapy were used to assess TMZ response. T1Gd volumetric response is associated with younger patient age, increased number of TMZ cycles, longer time to nadir volume, and decreased tumor invasiveness. Moreover, increased adjuvant TMZ cycles corresponded with improved volumetric response only among more nodular tumors, and this volumetric response was associated with improved survival outcomes. Finally, in a subcohort of patients with known MGMT methylation status, methylated tumors were more diffusely invasive than unmethylated tumors, suggesting the improved response in nodular tumors is not driven by a preponderance of MGMT methylated tumors.Our finding that less diffusely invasive tumors are associated with greater volumetric response to TMZ suggests patients with these tumors may benefit from additional adjuvant TMZ cycles, even for those without MGMT methylation."
https://openalex.org/W3013899416,"Introduction Epidemiologically, cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor for the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, there has been few plausible explanations why cigarette smoking aggravated RA. We investigated the causal effect of smoking in experimental model of arthritis development. Methods During induction of experimental arthritis with collagen challenge, mice were exposed to a smoking environment with 3R4F cigarettes. Generated smoke was delivered to mice through a nose-only exposure chamber (ISO standard 3308). Human cartilage pellet was challenged by cigarette smoke extract to identify citrullinating potential in vitro. Results Cigarette smoke exacerbated arthritis in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. Exposure to smoke accelerated the onset of arthritis by 2 weeks compared to the conventional model without smoke. Citrullination of lung tissue as well as tarsal joints were revealed in smoke-aggravated CIA mice. Interestingly, tracheal cartilage was a core organ regarding intensity and area size of citrullination. The trachea might be an interesting organ in viewpoint of sharing cartilage with joint and direct smoke exposure. Anti-CCP antibodies were barely detected in the serum of CIA mice, they were significantly elevated in cigarette smoke group. Citrullinated antigens were increased in the serum of smoke-exposed mice. Lastly, a cigarette smoke extract enhanced human cartilage citrullination in vitro. Conclusions Missing link of arthritic mechanism between smoke and RA could be partially explained by tracheal citrullination. To control tracheal cartilage citrullination may be beneficial for preventing arthritis development or aggravation if cigarette smoke is becoming a risk factor to pre-arthritic individual."
https://openalex.org/W3013095455,"Introduction Ravulizumab (ALXN1210) is a long-lasting recycling IgG monoclonal antibody with an increased affinity for the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). The FcRn is essential for regulating IgG homeostasis. Saturation of the FcRn pathway is seen under high IgG doses as they compete with endogenous IgG to bind the FcRn by their Fc regions, resulting in enhanced IgG clearance. Patients/Methods Between Jan 2016 and Jun 2019 (median observation time 21.6 months (6–37.7 months)) serum IgG concentrations and IgG1-4 subclasses were evaluated over a longitudinal course (post-hoc analysis) in 12 ravulizumab-treated adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) (58% (7/12) males, median age 50 years (yrs) (18–70 yrs)). All patients were enrolled in one of the three ravulizumab-PNH-related trials (201-, 301-, or 302-study) at the University Hospital Essen. Results Baseline IgG concentrations were documented in 11 out of the 12 patients prior to ravulizumab treatment (median IgG 9.9 g/L (5–13.5 g/L)). In two female patients a clinically not relevant hypogammaglobulinemia with an associated IgG1 or a combined IgG1/IgG2 deficiency prior to treatment was documented. The data were further stratified with regard to various treatment intervals as multiple analyses were obtained. Throughout observation time IgG concentrations remained within physiologic ranges with no evidence of a treatment-related IgG depletion (median IgG at study endpoint 10.1 g/L (6–13.4 g/L)). Conclusion In ravulizumab-treated PNH patients, IgG and IgG subclass levels which are regulated by the FcRn remained unaffected. Therefore, no treatment associated hypogammaglobulinemia is to be feared under chronic ravulizumab therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3013404391,"Different morphotypes of the abundant marine calcifying algal species Emiliania huxleyi are commonly linked to various degrees of E. huxleyi calcification, but few studies have been done to validate this assumption. This study investigated therefore whether E. huxleyi morphotypes can be related to coccolithophore calcification and coccolith mass. Samples from January (high productivity) and September (low productivity) 1997 at an open ocean and a coastal site near the Canary Islands were analysed using a combination of thickness measurements (Circular Polarizer Retardation estimates (CPR) method), Scanning Electron Microscope imaging, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) models. Mean E. huxleyi coccolith mass varied from a maximum of 2.9pg at the open ocean station in January to a minimum of 1.7pg in September at both stations. In contrast, overall calcite produced by E. huxleyi (assuming 23 coccoliths/cell) varied from a maximum of 2.6 μgL-1 at the coastal station in January to a minimum of 0.5 μgL-1 in September at the open ocean site. The relative abundance of “Overcalcified” Type A, Type A, Group B and malformed coccoliths was determined from SEM images. The mean coccolith mass of “Overcalcified” Type A was 2.0pg using the CPR-method, while mean mass of Type A and Group B coccoliths was determined using coccolith length measurements from SEM images and MCMC models relating thickness measurements to morphotype relative abundance. Type A cocccolith mass varied from a 1.6pg to 2.6pg and Group B coccolith mass varied from 1.5pg to 2.0pg. These results demonstrate that the coccolith mass of Type A, “Overcalcified” Type A, and Group B do not differ systematically and there is no systematic relationship between relative abundance of a morphotype and the overall calcite production of E. huxleyi. Therefore, morphotype appearance and relative abundance can not be uniformly used as reliable indicators of E. huxleyi calcification or calcite production."
https://openalex.org/W3013996555,"Pathogenic spirochetes from genus Leptospira are etiologic agents of leptospirosis. Cellular vaccines against Leptospira infection often elicit mainly response against the LPS antigen of the serovars present in the formulation. There is no suitable protein candidate capable of replacing whole-cell vaccines, thus requiring new approaches on vaccine development to improve leptospirosis prevention. Our goal was to develop a whole-cell vaccine sorovar-independent based on LPS removal and conservation of protein antigens exposure, to evaluate the protective capacity of monovalent or bivalent vaccines against homologous and heterologous virulent Leptospira in hamster. Leptospire were subjected to heat inactivation, or to LPS extraction with butanol and in some cases further inactivation with formaldehyde. Hamsters were immunized and challenged with homologous or heterologous virulent serovars, blood and organs were collected from the survivors for bacterial quantification, chemokine evaluation, and analysis of sera antibody reactivity and cross-reactivity by Western blot. Immunization with either heated or low LPS vaccines with serovar Copenhageni or Canicola resulted in 100% protection of the animals challenged with homologous virulent bacteria. Notably, different from the whole-cell vaccine, the low LPS vaccines produced with serovar Canicola provided only partial protection in heterologous challenge with the virulent Copenhageni serovar. Immunization with bivalent formulation results in 100% protection of immunized animals challenged with virulent serovar Canicola. All vaccines produced were able to eliminate bacteria from the kidney of challenged animals. All the vaccines raised antibodies capable to recognize antigens of serovars not present in the vaccine formulation. Transcripts of IFNγ, CXCL16, CCL5, CXCL10, CXCR6, and CCR5, increased in all immunized animals. Conclusion: Our results showed that bivalent vaccines with reduced LPS may be an interesting strategy for protection against heterologous virulent serovars. Besides the desirable multivalent protection, the low LPS vaccines are specially promising due to the expected lower reatogenicity."

A human mutation of the human heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20-S10F) in mice has been recently shown to result in cardiomyopathy, when exposed to pregnancies. Treatment with either probenecid or control sucrose water was initiated after the first pregnancy in both wild type and Hsp20-S10F mice. Serial echocardiography was performed during subsequent pregnancies and hearts were collected after the third pregnancies for staining and molecular analysis. Hsp20-S10F mice treated with probenecid had decreased mortality, hypertrophy, TRPV2 expression and molecular parameters of heart failure. Probenecid treatment also decreased apoptosis as evidenced by an increase in the level of Bcl-2/Bax. Probenecid improved survival in a novel mouse model of PPCM and may be an appropriate therapy for humans with PPCM as it has a proven safety and tolerability in patients with heart failure."

Objective To investigate whether delivery of a small for gestational age (SGA) infant in the 1st pregnancy increases the risk of early and late onset pre-eclampsia in the 2nd pregnancy. Conversely, we investigated whether pre-eclampsia in the 1st pregnancy impacts SGA risk in the 2nd pregnancy. Study design We studied a cohort from the Dutch Perinatal Registry of 265,031 women with 1st and 2nd singleton pregnancies who delivered between 2000 and 2007. We analyzed 2nd pregnancy risks of early and late onset pre-eclampsia—defined by delivery before or after 34 gestational weeks—as well as SGA below the 5th and between the 5th and 10th percentiles risks with multivariable logistic regressions. Interaction terms between 1st pregnancy hypertension, pre-eclampsia, SGA, and delivery before or after 34 gestational weeks were included in the regressions. Results First pregnancy early onset pre-eclampsia increased risk of SGA <5th percentile (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.7–2.7) in the 2nd pregnancy. Late onset pre-eclampsia increased the SGA <5th percentile marginally (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0–1.3). In the absence of 1st pregnancy hypertensive disorder, women who delivered an SGA infant in their 1st pregnancy were at increased risk of 2nd pregnancy late onset pre-eclampsia (SGA <5th: OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.58–2.66; SGA 5–10th: OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.01–1.93). Early onset 2nd pregnancy pre-eclampsia risk was also increased, but this was only statistically significant for women who delivered an SGA infant below the 5th percentile in the 1st pregnancy (SGA <5th: OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.19–5.00; SGA 5–10th: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.68–4.24;). Conclusion Women with 1st pregnancy early onset pre-eclampsia have increased risk of SGA <5th percentile in the 2nd pregnancy. SGA in the 1st pregnancy increases pre-eclampsia risk in the 2nd pregnancy even in the absence of hypertensive disorders in the 1st pregnancy, although absolute risks remain low. These findings strengthen the evidence base associating intrauterine growth restriction with early onset pre-eclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W3012998317,"The ability to avoid harmful or potentially harmful stimuli can help an organism escape predators and injury, and certain avoidance mechanisms are conserved across the animal kingdom. However, how the need to avoid an imminent threat is balanced with current behavior and modified by past experience is not well understood. In this work we focused on rapidly increasing temperature, a signal that triggers an escape response in a variety of animals, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We have developed a noxious thermal response assay using an infrared laser that can be automatically controlled and targeted in order to investigate how C. elegans responds to noxious heat over long timescales and to repeated stimuli in various behavioral and sensory contexts. High-content phenotyping of behavior in individual animals revealed that the C. elegans escape response is multidimensional, with some features that extend for several minutes, and can be modulated by (i) stimulus amplitude; (ii) other sensory inputs, such as food context; (iii) long and short-term thermal experience; and (iv) the animal's current behavioral state."
https://openalex.org/W3013006907,"The spinyhead croaker (Collichthys lucidus) is a commercially important fish species, which is mainly distributed in the coastal regions of China. However, little is known about the molecular regulatory mechanism underlying reproduction in C. lucidus. A de novo transcriptome assembly in brain, liver, ovary and testis tissues of C. lucidus was performed. Illumina sequencing generated 60,322,004, 57,044,284, 60,867,978 and 57,087,688 clean reads from brain, liver, ovary and testis tissues of C. lucidus, respectively. Totally, 131,168 unigenes with an average length of 644 bp and an N50 value of 1033 bp were assembled. In addition, 1288 genes were differentially expressed between ovary and testis, including 442 up-regulated and 846 down-regulated in ovary. Functional analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes between ovary and testis were mainly involved in the function of sexual reproduction, sex differentiation, development of primary male sexual characteristics, female gamete generation, and male sex differentiation. A number of genes which might be involved in the regulation of reproduction and sex determination were found, including HYAL and SYCP3 and BMP15. Furthermore, 35,476 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified in this transcriptome dataset, which would contribute to further genetic and mechanism researches. De novo transcriptome sequencing analysis of four organs of C. lucidus provides rich resources for understanding the mechanism of reproductive development of C. lucidus and further investigation of the molecular regulation of sex determination and reproduction of C. lucidus."
https://openalex.org/W3013149243,"Nocardia cholesterolicum NRRL 5767 is well-known for its ability to convert oleic acid to 10-hydroxystearic acid (~88%, w/w) and 10-ketostearic acid (~11%, w/w). Conversion of oleic acid to 10-hydroxystearic acid and then to 10-ketostearic acid has been proposed to be catalyzed by oleate hydratase and secondary alcohol dehydrogenase, respectively. Hydroxy fatty acids are value-added with many industrial applications. The objective of this study was to improve the Nocardia cholesterolicum NRRL5767 strain by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to knockout the secondary alcohol dehydrogenase gene, thus blocking the conversion of 10-hydroxystearic acid to 10-ketostearic acid. The improved strain would produce 10-hydroxystearic acid solely from oleic acid. Such improvement would enhance the production of 10-hydroxystearic acid by eliminating downstream separation of 10-hydroxystearic acid from 10-ketostearic acid. Here, we report: (1) Molecular cloning and characterization of two functional recombinant oleate hydratase isozymes and a functional recombinant secondary alcohol dehydrogenase from Nocardia cholesterolicum NRRL5767. Existence of two oleate hydratase isozymes may explain the high conversion yield of 10-hydroxystearic acid from oleic acid. (2) Construction of a CRISPR/Cas9/sgRNA chimeric plasmid that specifically targeted the secondary alcohol dehydrogenase gene by Golden Gate Assembly. (3) Transformation of the chimeric plasmid into Nocardia cholesterolicum NRRL 5767 by electroporation and screening of secondary alcohol dehydrogenase knockout mutants. Two mutants were validated by their lack of secondary alcohol dehydrogenase activity at the protein level and mutation at the targeted 5’ coding region and the 5’ upstream at the DNA level. The knockout mutants offer improvements by converting added oleic acid to solely 10-hydroxystearic acid, thus eliminating downstream separation of 10-hydroxystearic acid from 10-ketostearic acid. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first successful knockout of a target gene in the Nocardia species using CRISPR/Cas9/sgRNA-mediated genome editing technology."
https://openalex.org/W3013070512,"The small Neotropical finches called capuchinos are outstanding because they have experienced one of the most recent and explosive avian radiations ever documented for birds. Despite very low morphological and niche divergence among species, many of them are reproductively isolated when in sympatry due to strong sexual selection in plumage traits. However, a specific pair of mostly parapatric species, the Pearly-bellied, Sporophila pileata, and the Copper Seedeaters, S. bouvreuil, has confounded taxonomists because individuals with intermediate color patterns can be found. By analyzing diagnostic COI mtDNA sequences and adult male plumage we provide evidence for hybridization. Paternity tests using microsatellites also indicated that representatives with intermediate plumage pattern can be fertile. Our findings are consistent with the classification of S. bouvreuil and S. pileata as distinct taxa, but we demonstrate that the sexual selection mechanisms involved in the isolation of other reproductively sympatric capuchinos are not applicable to this pair of species, likely because of reduced barriers to mate recognition."
https://openalex.org/W3013832633,"There is increasing interest in future, highly-potent ‘pan-TB’ regimens against tuberculosis (TB), that may be equally effective in both drug-susceptible and rifampicin-resistant (RR) forms of TB. Taking the example of India, the country with the world’s largest burden of TB, we show that adoption of these regimens could be: (i) epidemiologically impactful, and (ii) cost-saving to the national TB programme, even if the regimen itself is more costly than current TB treatment. Mathematical modelling suggests that deployment of a pan-TB regimen in 2022 would reduce the annual incidence of TB in 2030 by 23.9% [95% Bayesian credible intervals [CrI] 17.6–30.8%] if used to treat all TB cases, and by 2.30% [95% CrI 1.57–3.48%] if used to treat only RR-TB. Notably, with a regimen costing less than USD 359 (95% CrI 287–441), treating all diagnosed TB cases with the pan-TB regimen yielded greater cost-savings than treating just those diagnosed with RR-TB. One limitation of our approach is that it does not capture the risk of resistance to the new regimen. We discuss ways in which this risk could be mitigated using modern adherence support mechanisms, as well as drug sensitivity testing at the point of TB diagnosis, to prevent new resistant forms from becoming established. A combination of such approaches would be important for maximising the useful lifetime of any future regimen."
https://openalex.org/W3013998050,"In population exposed to cardiovascular risk, aortic stiffness is an important marker which is assessed by carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). In childhood, the validated applanation tonometer SphygmoCor® can be used to measure PWV, but is limited in routine practice by the child’s cooperation and operator’s experience. An alternative device, the pOpmètre® is validated in adults and rapidly measures finger-to-toe PWV using 2 oxymeter-like sensors. The aim of this study is to validate the pOpmètre® device in children aged between 4 and 8 years. We compared simultaneous PWV measurements of the two devices, SphygmoCor® and pOpmètre®, in a training group, using the Bland-Altman method. Then we proposed an algorithm to correct pOpmètre® PWV (PWVpop). Finally, we validated this new algorithm in a validation group of children using the Bland-Altman method. This prospective study enrolled 26 children in the training group. Mean PWVpop was 3.919 ± 0.587 m/s and mean SphygmoCor® PWV was 4.280 ± 0.383 m/s, with a difference of -0.362(CI95%(-0.546;-0.178)) m/s. A new algorithm was defined using transit time (TTpop): corrected PWVpop (m/s) = 0.150/TTpop(s) + 1.381*Height(m) + 1.148. We enrolled 24 children in the validation group. Mean corrected PWVpop was 4.231 ± 0.189 m/s and mean SphygmoCor® PWV was 4.208 ± 0.296 m/s with a corrected difference of 0.023(CI95%(-0.086;0.131)) m/s. With this algorithm correction, we found an agreement between PWV measured by the SphygmoCor® and the pOpmètre®, with a difference of less than 10%. Using this algorithm, the pOpmètre® could be used in clinical or research practice in young children exposed to cardiovascular risk. (This study was registered as NCT02991703)."
https://openalex.org/W3014041030,"Social assistance is a means-tested benefit that is supposed to be a short-term, temporary economic support. Understanding why some individuals are in repeated or continuous need of social assistance is thus of obvious policy relevance, but the dynamics of social assistance receipt remain poorly understood. In 2005, a survey among long-term recipients of social assistance in Norway collected data on (a) childhood disadvantages, (b) health status, (c) health behaviors, (d) psychological resources, and (e) social ties, in addition to basic sociodemographic information. This rich survey data has been linked with tax register data from 2005–2013, enabling us to explore the detailed characteristics of long-term social assistance recipients who are unable to reach financial self-sufficiency. Results from linear probability models show that surprisingly few of the 28 explanatory variables are statistically associated with social assistance dynamics, with two important exceptions: People with drug problems and immigrants both have a much higher probability of social assistance receipt. Yet overall, it is challenging to ‘predict’ social assistance dynamics, indicating that randomness most likely plays a non-negligible role. The 28 explanatory variables do a far better job in predicting both labor market success (employment), labor market preparation (work assessment allowance), and labor market withdrawal (disability benefit utilization). Thus, there seems to be something distinctive about the processes leading to continued social assistance recipiency, where randomness could be a more influential force."
https://openalex.org/W3013885526,"Inhibition of the complement activation has emerged as an option for treatment of a range of diseases. Activation of the lectin and alternative pathways (LP and AP, respectively) contribute to the deterioration of conditions in certain diseases such as ischemia-reperfusion injuries and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In the current study, we generated dual complement inhibitors of the pathways MAp44-FH and sMAP-FH by fusing full-length MAp44 or small mannose-binding lectin-associated protein (sMAP), LP regulators, with the N-terminal five short consensus repeat (SCR) domains of complement factor H (SCR1/5-FH), an AP regulator. The murine forms of both fusion proteins formed a complex with endogenous mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolin A in the circulation when administered in mice intraperitoneally. Multiple complement activation assays revealed that sMAP-FH had significantly higher inhibitory effects on activation of the LP and AP in vivo as well as in vitro compared to MAp44-FH. Human form of sMAP-FH also showed dual inhibitory effects on LP and AP activation in human sera. Our results indicate that the novel fusion protein sMAP-FH inhibits both the LP and AP activation in mice and in human sera, and could be an effective therapeutic agent for diseases in which both the LP and AP activation are significantly involved."
https://openalex.org/W3013115079,"Oil pipelines are vulnerable at river crossings since floods can expose and rupture pipes, releasing oil that floats and coats floodplain vegetation. This study investigated the consequences of oil coatings on leaves of cottonwoods (riparian poplars), the predominant trees in floodplain woodlands around the Northern Hemisphere. The study compared conventional crude oil (CO) versus diluted bitumen (dilbit, DB), heavy oil originating from the Alberta oil sands; with petroleum jelly (PJ) as a reference. The treatments increased leaf surface temperatures (Tleaf) in narrowleaf and plains cottonwoods (Populus angustifolia, P. deltoides) and balsam poplars (P. balsamifera) (Control = 21.8°C, PJ = 23.7°C; CO = 26.2°C; DB = 28.1°C; Tair = 25°C). The leaf warming followed stomatal occlusion from the foliar coating, which would reduce transpiration and evaporative cooling, combined with increased solar warming with the darker oils. Tleaf varied across the three cottonwood species, with cooler, narrow, narrowleaf cottonwood leaves; intermediate plains cottonwood leaves; and warmer, darker, balsam poplar leaves (average Tleaf: narrowleaf = 23.8°C, plains = 24.3°C, and balsam = 26.7°C), with similar warming in each species following the different treatments. Across species and treatments, Tleaf was tightly correlated with foliar condition, which assessed turgor versus wilting of leaf blades and petioles, along with leaf necrosis and senescence (r2 = 0.980, narrowleaf; 0.998, plains; 0.852, balsam). This tight association indicates validity of both Tleaf and foliar condition as diagnostic measures. Crude oil and dilbit had similar foliar impacts, and for both, leaf abscission occurred within 2 to 3 weeks. Consequently, following an oil spill, remediation should commence quickly but extending vegetation removal beyond a few weeks would have limited benefit since the contaminated leaves would have abscised."
https://openalex.org/W3013210588,"The HIV-1 epidemic in Brazil has been growing in northeast and north regions, particularly an increase in AIDS cases among the younger male population has been observed. This study aims to characterize the HIV-1 genetic diversity and to evaluate its antiretroviral resistance profile among individuals presenting virological failure in the state of Maranhão—Brazil. HIV-1 pol gene sequences from 633 patients on antiretroviral therapy were obtained from the Department of Surveillance, Prevention and Control of Sexually Transmitted Infections, HIV/AIDS and Viral Hepatitis of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Phylogenetic and recombination analyses were performed to characterize viral genetic diversity. The presence of antiretroviral resistance mutations was assessed using the HIV Drug Resistance Database online platform of Stanford University. A predominance of subtype B (84.5%) was observed, followed by recombinant BF (9.5%), where more than half of the sequences were dispersed in 3 clusters. Antiretroviral resistance was detected in 74.1% of the sequences, and it was significantly higher for nucleoside analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) than for non-nucleoside analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs). Inference of putative transmissions clusters identified 11 clusters with 22 query sequences (22/633, 3.5%). Thus, we conclude that continuous monitoring of the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 is essential for prevention strategies, epidemic control, and treatment adequacy."

However, problems of otitits caused by Psoroptes cuniculi are one of the main reasons to visit the veterinarian. Isoxazolines are an alternative treatment to treat this mite, and therefore, an evaluation of the effectiveness of oral afoxalaner with milbemycin oxime in rabbits infected with P. cuniculi was carried out. Nineteen rabbits, of New Zealand breed, with otitis due to an infection with P. cuniculi, were treated, whereas six rabbits were left untreated and formed the control group. The ear canals of each individual were examined, through the collection of otic exudate samples with cotton swabs. These were visualized under the microscope to identify the ectoparasite. Each animal was treated with a single oral dose of 2.50 mg / kg of afoxolaner, and 0.50 mg / kg of milbemycin oxime. Clinical signs and lesions associated with the infection, such as the presence of detritus, cerumen and / or scabs, and erythema, were evaluated. After receiving the treatment, all the lesions were classified as: mild, moderate and intense, with a visual analog scale. A week after providing medication, there was a decrease in the lesions of the group treated with Nexgard Spectra®, without further topical or systemic treatment. The decrease was gradual in the treated group and no recurrence was detected of P. cuniculi infection in both ears. Thus, the administration of a single oral dose of afoxolaner with milbemycin oxime was effective for the treatment of P. cuniculi infection in rabbits."
https://openalex.org/W3013437972,"Background & aims In 2012, the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system designated a single large hepatocellular carcinoma (SLHCC) (>5 cm) as BCLC stage A rather than stage B. However, a recent study from western countries reported that prognosis following liver resection (LR) among patients with SLHCC was similar to that among patients with BCLC stage B. We aim to evaluate the prognosis following LR among patients with SLHCC from an Asian high-volume liver surgery center. Methods Patients who underwent curative-intent LR for histologically proven HCC between 2011 and 2017 were enrolled using an HCC registry database. Overall survival (OS) among patients with BCLC stages 0, A, and B was examined. Patients with a SLHCC were classified as BCLC stage A1. Results Among 543 patients, 89 (16.4%) were BCLC stage 0, 289 (53.2%) were BCLC stage A, 92 (16.9%) were BCLC stage A1, and 73 (13.4%) were BCLC stage B. The median follow-up was 38 months. The five-year OS rates among patients with BCLC stages 0, A, A1, and B were 83.5%, 83.7%, 77.4%, and 55.4%, respectively (p<0.001). No difference in OS was noted for patients with BCLC stage A versus A1 (p = 0.11), even after adjusting for competing factors (hazard ratio = 0.97, 95% confidence interval = 0.53–1.79; p = 0.93). Conclusion Prognosis following LR among patients with SLHCC was similar to that among patients with BCLC stage A. The prognosis for SLHCC should thus be considered comparable to that for BCLC stage A."
https://openalex.org/W3013675346,"In imaging systems, image blurs are a major source of degradation. This paper proposes a parameter estimation technique for linear motion blur, defocus blur, and atmospheric turbulence blur, and a nonlinear deconvolution algorithm based on sparse representation. Most blur removal techniques use image priors to estimate the point spread function (PSF); however, many common forms of image priors are unable to exploit local image information fully. In this paper, the proposed method does not require models of image priors. Further, it is capable of estimating the PSF accurately from a single input image. First, a blur feature in the image gradient domain is introduced, which has a positive correlation with the degree of blur. Next, the parameters for each blur type are estimated by a learning-based method using a general regression neural network. Finally, image restoration is performed using a half-quadratic optimization algorithm. Evaluation tests confirmed that the proposed method outperforms other similar methods and is suitable for dealing with motion blur in real-life applications."
https://openalex.org/W3013034339,"Vegetative parts of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) are important forage for many boreal forest mammal, bird and insect species. Plant palatability to insects is affected by concentration of nutrients and defense compounds in plants. We expected that palatability of bilberry leaves to insect herbivores is influenced by light availability and soil productivity (both affecting nitrogen concentration and constitutive carbon-based defense compound concentration) and herbivory by mammals (affecting nitrogen concentration and induced carbon-based defense compound concentration). We studied bilberry leaf herbivory under different light availability, soil productivity and mammalian herbivory pressure in small sampling units (1m x 1m) in boreal forest in Norway. We used generalized linear mixed models and generalized additive mixed models to model insect herbivory on bilberry leaves as a function of shade, soil productivity and mammalian herbivory. Observed insect herbivory on bilberry leaves increased with increasing shade levels. Predicted insect herbivory increased with increasing previous mammalian herbivory at high shade levels and this response was magnified at higher soil productivity levels. At low to intermediate shade levels, this response was only present under high soil productivity levels. Our results indicate that light availability is more important for variation in bilberry leaf palatability than soil nutrient conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3013266851,"Background Results of medical research should be made publicly available in a timely manner to enable patients and health professionals to make informed decisions about health issues. We aimed to apply a multi-state model to analyze the overall time needed to publish study results, and to examine predictors of the timing of transitions within the research process from study initiation through completion/discontinuation to eventual publication. Methods Using a newly developed multi-state model approach, we analysed the effect of different study-related factors on each of the transitions from study approval to eventual publication, using a data set of clinical studies approved by a German research ethics committee between 2000 and 2002. Results Of 917 approved studies, 806 were included in our analyses. About half of the clinical studies which began were subsequently published as full articles, and the median time from study approval to publication was 10 years. Differences across model states were apparent; several factors were predictive of the transition from study approval to completion, while funding source and collaboration were predictive of the transition from completion to publication. Conclusions The proposed multi-state model approach permits a more comprehensive analysis of time to publication than a simple examination of the transition from approval to publication, and thus the findings represent an advance on previous studies of this aspect of the research process."
