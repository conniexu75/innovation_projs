A few values as high as 10 times the average have been obtained. This value is in accord with the predicted value based on fallout measurements and fractionation through the soilplant-milk-human chain. With the present burden of strontium-90, this average level should rise to 1 to 2 micromicrocuries of strontium-90 per gram of calcium by 1970."

The indirect method of immunofluorescence was utilized in this investigation to study antibody response to sporozoite-induced Plasmodium vivax infections in two human volunteers. Malarial antibody was demonstrated approximately 3 weeks after infection, and has persisted thus far for 121 days. These preliminary results suggest that this method of serological testing is specific and provides a sensitive means of titrating antibody produced in malarial infections."

For example, the average adult bone level in the eastern United States 5 years after the detonation of a specified quantity of fission products into the lower polar stratosphere can probably be estimated to better than +/- 50 percent. 2) The concentration of strontium-90 in fetuses reached a maximum of 1.2 micromicrocuries of strontium-90 per gram of calcium in eastern North America and began to decrease significantly in 1960 and 1961. The ratio of the strontium-90 level in the fetus to the level in the average diet of the adult is about 0.08. 3) The average rate of turnover of strontium and calcium in the adult skeleton appears to be about 2.5 percent per year, although there is considerable difference among the various bones of the body. 4) The standard deviation for strontium-90 concentration in a population of urban adults appears to be about 40 percent of the mean. The distribution curve for an interval of from 60 to 0.1 percent of the population may be approximated by the log-normal function. In urban populations of Western culture the concentration for 5 percent of the population will exceed twice the mean, that for 0.1 percent will exceed four times the mean. 5) Cities in the Southern Hemisphere showed levels in bone about half those for cities of Western culture in the Northern Hemisphere in 1960, yet the fallout in the Southern Hemisphere is only one-fourth that in the Northern Hemisphere. This is attributed to differences in diet, with a higher milk component in the Northern Hemisphere. 6) A simple model for the strontium-90 concentration in the bones of young people as a function of their age appears to fit the experimental data. 7) The coefficients of the equation describing the relative contributions of the rate of fallout (direct absorption) and the cumulative deposit (soil up-take) to the strontium-90 concentration in milk have been calculated from the observed data for 1959 and 1960. They are as follows: rate factor A = 0.65 micromicrocurie of strontium-90 per gram of calcium in milk per millicurie of strontium-90 per square mile during the growing season; cumulative-deposit factor B = 0.12 micromicrocurie of strontium-90 per gram of calcium in milk per millicurie of strontium-90 per square mile at the midpoint of the growing season. The predicted levels in milk for 1958 obtained with these coefficients are in excellent agreement with the observed levels. In 1958 and 1959 about half the strontium-90 in milk was attributable to the rate factor, whereas in 1960 the contribution of the rate factor dropped to about 15 percent. 8) Future levels of strontium-90 in man are given (i) for the next decade as a result of the nuclear tests through 1961 and (ii) under the assumption that 1.0 megacurie of strontium-90 is added to the stratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere each year. 9) The radiation doses to the skeleton to be expected from world-wide fallout on the basis of a 3000-megaton (fission yield) war are also given."

https://openalex.org/W175535686,"The deoxyribonucleic acid of the T-even coliphages contains glucosylated and nonglucosylated 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in place of cytosine (l-6). In the case of deoxyribonucleic acid from phage T6, 72y0 of the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine residues are diglucosylated. In T2 deoxyribonucleic acid, 70% of the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine residues are monoglucosylated, but 5% bear diglucosyl units. A recent investigation of the configuration of the disaccharides bound to the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine nucleotides of deoxyribonucleic acid from T2 and T6 showed the glucose units to be p linked to each other and joined to the hydroxymethyl group of the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine by an cr linkage (6). In the present study, the disaccharide from T6 deoxyribonucleic acid was identified as gentiobiose, 6-O-O-D-ghcOpyranOSyl-D-ghCOSe. This disaccharide is unique to deoxyribonucleic acid from phage T6 and possibly T2 and has been observed only in such glycosides as amygdalin and crocin, and as part of the trisaccharide, gentianose."

https://openalex.org/W2076990450,"DURING an investigation on the free amino-acids in marine algae, I isolated a new ninhydrin-reactive substance from three species of red algae Chondrus ocellatus, Neodelsea yendoana and Iridaea cornucopiae by the use of anionic ion-exchange resin ‘Amberlite IR–45’ and ‘Dowex 2’. This substance gave an empirical formula C5H11O5NS and melted at 258° C. Optical rotation gave a value [α]13D = −1.15 (c = 5, M sodium hydroxide solution). It was not very sensitive to ninhydrin, but gave a bright brown colour with Plattner's reagent. Titration with 0.1 N sodium hydroxide, in alcoholic solution, gave a value 63.80 per cent (calculated as C4H7N—SO3H—COOH, 66.16 per cent). By the method of Kuhn and Roth, at least one radical, C—CH3, was estimated. The oxidation products obtained, after treatment with potassium permanganate solution, were taurine, alanine and propionic acid. From these results, the structure N-(l-carboxy-ethyl)-taurine, that is , was assumed. Crystals obtained from α-brompropionic acid and taurine by chemical synthesis corresponded well with the isolated substance not only in melting point but also in RF values on various paper chromatograms."

Such use of electronics in biomedical science holds promise of tremendous advances in the study of the origins of the life processes; it may result in spectacular advances in medical science, which could have a definite effect on individual health and longevity; it might pave the way for the discovery and development of whole new technologies based on intimate knowledge of biological processes. Great strides can be made in surmounting the major obstacles by combating apathy, through making the public and the industrial community aware of the potentialities of modern biomedical research, and by giving scientists adequate cross-disciplinary training and using the abilities of those so trained (1)."
https://openalex.org/W2074028709,"The Diego blood group is an exclusive Mongoloid gene marker, although it is not present in all Mongoloid populations. The absence of the gene in Waica Indians and its very low frequencies in Warrau and Yaruro Indians of South America suggest that it represents a genetic characteristic of Marginal American Indians. Since Marginal Indians are considered to be early comers to the New World, we suggest that Diego-negative populations were the first to arrive and to extend throughout South America, while the Diego-positive tribes came later."

https://openalex.org/W2072761613,"Human serum beta-lipoprotein (specific gravity 1.063 to 1.007) has previously been shown to form two lines on immunoelectrophoresis. In the study of a large number of individual sera it appears that both are not always present, that they are present in varying amounts in normal individuals, that a third form sometimes exists, that they are not separable by sedimentation techniques, and that they crossreact immunologically. These can also be demonstrated on starch gels and starch gel immunoelectrophoresis, one form entering the gel and the other remaining at the origin."

https://openalex.org/W1980808752,"Experiments with alfalfa were carried out to study the possibility of changes with time in the availability of radiostrontium in soil. After the soil was treated once with Sr85, the first crop was harvested after 60 days of growth. Four subsequent crops, cut at successive 4-week intervals, were examined. The difference in uptake between the second and fifth crops was statistically significant, suggesting that some fixation of Sr85 may occur in the soil. The effects of various applications of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, monocalcium phosphate, calcium chloride, and potassium chloride on the uptake of Sr85 by alfalfa were also investigated. Of the experiments carried out, only the treatment with 1.0 meq of potassium per 100g of soil resulted in a statistically significant reduction in strontium uptake."
