https://openalex.org/W2132764286,"Quantum networks provide opportunities and challenges across a range of intellectual and technical frontiers, including quantum computation, communication and metrology. The realization of quantum networks composed of many nodes and channels requires new scientific capabilities for generating and characterizing quantum coherence and entanglement. Fundamental to this endeavour are quantum interconnects, which convert quantum states from one physical system to those of another in a reversible manner. Such quantum connectivity in networks can be achieved by the optical interactions of single photons and atoms, allowing the distribution of entanglement across the network and the teleportation of quantum states between nodes."
https://openalex.org/W1983336715,"Superconducting circuits are macroscopic in size but have generic quantum properties such as quantized energy levels, superposition of states, and entanglement, all of which are more commonly associated with atoms. Superconducting quantum bits (qubits) form the key component of these circuits. Their quantum state is manipulated by using electromagnetic pulses to control the magnetic flux, the electric charge or the phase difference across a Josephson junction (a device with nonlinear inductance and no energy dissipation). As such, superconducting qubits are not only of considerable fundamental interest but also might ultimately form the primitive building blocks of quantum computers."
https://openalex.org/W2131871062,"Lancelets (‘amphioxus’) are the modern survivors of an ancient chordate lineage, with a fossil record dating back to the Cambrian period. Here we describe the structure and gene content of the highly polymorphic ∼520-megabase genome of the Florida lancelet Branchiostoma floridae, and analyse it in the context of chordate evolution. Whole-genome comparisons illuminate the murky relationships among the three chordate groups (tunicates, lancelets and vertebrates), and allow not only reconstruction of the gene complement of the last common chordate ancestor but also partial reconstruction of its genomic organization, as well as a description of two genome-wide duplications and subsequent reorganizations in the vertebrate lineage. These genome-scale events shaped the vertebrate genome and provided additional genetic variation for exploitation during vertebrate evolution. This issue sees the publication of the draft genome sequence of an animal that has been studied by biologists for many years as a model for a primitive chordate. The amphioxus or lancelet is a small worm-like creature, usually to be found buried in sand on the sea floor. Comparative analysis of the genome of the Florida lancelet, Branchiostoma floridae, reveals 17 ancestral chordate linkage groups conserved in the modern amphioxus and vertebrate genomes despite more than half a billion years of independent evolution. From this it possible to make a virtual reconstruction of the 17 chromosomes of the last common chordate ancestor. This reconstruction conforms that two rounds of whole genome duplication have occurred during evolution of the jawed vertebrate lineage. And it illuminates the murky relationships between the three chordate groups, the tunicates, lancelets and vertebrates. The cover shows four adult amphioxus collected in Apalachee Bay, Florida, with anterior towards the top and dorsal to the right. Yellow ovals are gonads.

https://openalex.org/W2041566506,"In the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) rhodopsin, the inactivating ligand 11-cis-retinal is bound in the seven-transmembrane helix (TM) bundle and is cis/trans isomerized by light to form active metarhodopsin II. With metarhodopsin II decay, all-trans-retinal is released, and opsin is reloaded with new 11-cis-retinal. Here we present the crystal structure of ligand-free native opsin from bovine retinal rod cells at 2.9 ångström (A) resolution. Compared to rhodopsin, opsin shows prominent structural changes in the conserved E(D)RY and NPxxY(x)(5,6)F regions and in TM5-TM7. At the cytoplasmic side, TM6 is tilted outwards by 6-7 A, whereas the helix structure of TM5 is more elongated and close to TM6. These structural changes, some of which were attributed to an active GPCR state, reorganize the empty retinal-binding pocket to disclose two openings that may serve the entry and exit of retinal. The opsin structure sheds new light on ligand binding to GPCRs and on GPCR activation."

https://openalex.org/W2069831652,"Patients generally die of cancer after the failure of current therapies to eliminate residual disease. A subpopulation of tumor cells, termed cancer stem cells (CSC), appears uniquely able to fuel the growth of phenotypically and histologically diverse tumors. It has been proposed, therefore, that failure to effectively treat cancer may in part be due to preferential resistance of these CSC to chemotherapeutic agents. The subpopulation of human colorectal tumor cells with an ESA(+)CD44(+) phenotype are uniquely responsible for tumorigenesis and have the capacity to generate heterogeneous tumors in a xenograft setting (i.e. CoCSC). We hypothesized that if non-tumorigenic cells are more susceptible to chemotherapeutic agents, then residual tumors might be expected to contain a higher frequency of CoCSC.Xenogeneic tumors initiated with CoCSC were allowed to reach approximately 400 mm(3), at which point mice were randomized and chemotherapeutic regimens involving cyclophosphamide or Irinotecan were initiated. Data from individual tumor phenotypic analysis and serial transplants performed in limiting dilution show that residual tumors are enriched for cells with the CoCSC phenotype and have increased tumorigenic cell frequency. Moreover, the inherent ability of residual CoCSC to generate tumors appears preserved. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 gene expression and enzymatic activity are elevated in CoCSC and using an in vitro culture system that maintains CoCSC as demonstrated by serial transplants and lentiviral marking of single cell-derived clones, we further show that ALDH1 enzymatic activity is a major mediator of resistance to cyclophosphamide: a classical chemotherapeutic agent.CoCSC are enriched in colon tumors following chemotherapy and remain capable of rapidly regenerating tumors from which they originated. By focusing on the biology of CoCSC, major resistance mechanisms to specific chemotherapeutic agents can be attributed to specific genes, thereby suggesting avenues for improving cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2044322490,"The majority of proteins tend to bind to one or several copies of themselves and assemble as 'homo-oligomeric' complexes — or homomers. Based on the known crystallographic structures of 5,000 such complexes, Levy et al. have derived plausible pathways for the emergence of ever more complex such assemblies during evolution. Using electrospray mass spectrometry, they observe that the same pathways are followed on the shorter timescale of protein assembly in vitro. Homophilic protein interactions are fundamental in biochemical processes such as allostery and the predictive method developed here should help targeting drugs to protein–protein interfaces more efficiently. On the basis of the known crystallographic structures of 5000 'homo-oligomeric' complexes, this study derives plausible pathways for the emergence of ever more complex such assemblies during evolution. Using electrospray mass spectrometry, it is observed that the same pathways are followed on the shorter time-scale of protein assembly in vitro. A homomer is formed by self-interacting copies of a protein unit. This is functionally important1,2, as in allostery3,4,5, and structurally crucial because mis-assembly of homomers is implicated in disease6,7. Homomers are widespread, with 50–70% of proteins with a known quaternary state assembling into such structures8,9. Despite their prevalence, their role in the evolution of cellular machinery10,11 and the potential for their use in the design of new molecular machines12,13, little is known about the mechanisms that drive formation of homomers at the level of evolution and assembly in the cell9,14. Here we present an analysis of over 5,000 unique atomic structures and show that the quaternary structure of homomers is conserved in over 70% of protein pairs sharing as little as 30% sequence identity. Where quaternary structure is not conserved among the members of a protein family, a detailed investigation revealed well-defined evolutionary pathways by which proteins transit between different quaternary structure types. Furthermore, we show by perturbing subunit interfaces within complexes and by mass spectrometry analysis15, that the (dis)assembly pathway mimics the evolutionary pathway. These data represent a molecular analogy to Haeckel’s evolutionary paradigm of embryonic development, where an intermediate in the assembly of a complex represents a form that appeared in its own evolutionary history. Our model of self-assembly allows reliable prediction of evolution and assembly of a complex solely from its crystal structure."

https://openalex.org/W2005764967,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disease and it is critical to develop models which recapitulate the pathogenic process including the effect of the ageing process. Although the pathogenesis of sporadic PD is unknown, the identification of the mendelian genetic factor PINK1 has provided new mechanistic insights. In order to investigate the role of PINK1 in Parkinson's disease, we studied PINK1 loss of function in human and primary mouse neurons. Using RNAi, we created stable PINK1 knockdown in human dopaminergic neurons differentiated from foetal ventral mesencephalon stem cells, as well as in an immortalised human neuroblastoma cell line. We sought to validate our findings in primary neurons derived from a transgenic PINK1 knockout mouse. For the first time we demonstrate an age dependent neurodegenerative phenotype in human and mouse neurons. PINK1 deficiency leads to reduced long-term viability in human neurons, which die via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Human neurons lacking PINK1 demonstrate features of marked oxidative stress with widespread mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal mitochondrial morphology. We report that PINK1 plays a neuroprotective role in the mitochondria of mammalian neurons, especially against stress such as staurosporine. In addition we provide evidence that cellular compensatory mechanisms such as mitochondrial biogenesis and upregulation of lysosomal degradation pathways occur in PINK1 deficiency. The phenotypic effects of PINK1 loss-of-function described here in mammalian neurons provides mechanistic insight into the age-related degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons seen in PD."

https://openalex.org/W2091412980,"Whereas studies involving animal models of cardiovascular disease demonstrated that resveratrol is able to inhibit hypertrophic growth, the mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. Because studies in cells other than cardiomyocytes revealed that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Akt are affected by resveratrol, we hypothesized that resveratrol prevents cardiac myocyte hypertrophy via these two kinase systems. Herein, we demonstrate that resveratrol reduces phenylephrine-induced protein synthesis and cell growth in rat cardiac myocytes via alterations of intracellular pathways involved in controlling protein synthesis (p70S6 kinase and eukaryotic elongation factor-2). Additionally, we demonstrate that resveratrol negatively regulates the calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells pathway thus modifying a critical component of the transcriptional mechanism involved in pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Our data also indicate that these effects of resveratrol are mediated via AMPK activation and Akt inhibition, and in the case of AMPK, is dependent on the presence of the AMPK kinase, LKB1. Taken together, our data suggest that resveratrol exerts anti-hypertrophic effects by activating AMPK via LKB1 and inhibiting Akt, thus suppressing protein synthesis and gene transcription.

Pathological left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality (1Benjamin E.J. Levy D. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1999; 317: 168-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is a major clinical concern in cardiovascular medicine. At the cellular level, enlargement of the cardiac myocyte involves multiple events, including gene transcription and protein translation/synthesis, which are regulated by protein kinase signaling cascades. For gene transcription, the calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) 6The abbreviations used are:NFATnuclear factor of activated T cellsp70S6Kp70S6 kinaseeEF2eukaryotic elongation factor-2AMPKAMP-activated protein kinaseGSK-3βglycogen synthase kinase-3βResvresveratrolPEphenylephrineCsAcyclosporin AMEFsmouse embryonic fibroblastsWTwild-typeMOImultiplicity of infectionACCacetyl-CoA carboxylaseANOVAanalysis of variance. signaling pathway has been shown to play a major role in the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy (2Wilkins B.J.

Upon dephosphorylation by calcineurin, NFAT translocates to the nucleus of the cardiac myocyte where it mediates the transcription of numerous targets involved in hypertrophic growth (see Ref. 3Wilkins B.J. Molkentin J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1178-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar for review). In conjunction with alterations in gene expression, an important cellular process that must also occur during hypertrophy is enhanced protein synthesis. While the list of proteins involved in regulating protein synthesis in the cardiac myocyte is extensive, the p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) and eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2) play key roles in this process (4Horman S.

Activation of Akt has been shown to promote cardiac hypertrophy via a number of pathways including the indirect activation of p70S6K (6Wang L. Wang X. Proud C.G. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

Yefremashvili M. Luo Z. Kureishi Y. Takahashi A. Tao J. Rosenzweig A. Kahn C.R. Abel E.D. Walsh K. J. Biol.

AMPK is a key regulator of energy homeostasis, which stimulates ATP-generating pathways and inhibits ATP-consuming pathways in response to the depletion of ATP by cellular stresses (13Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 315-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that pharmacological and genetic activation of AMPK in the cardiac myocyte can inhibit protein synthesis associated with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (5Chan A.Y. Soltys C.L. Young M.E. Proud C.G. Dyck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32771-32779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 14Noga A.A. Soltys C.L. Barr A.J. Kovacic S. Lopaschuk G.D. Dyck J.R. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H1460-H1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and that this effect was mediated by the inhibition of the p70S6K and eEF2 pathways. The anti-hypertrophic effects of AMPK activation was subsequently confirmed in vivo, as well as extended to include suppression of the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway (15Li H.L. Yin R. Chen D. Liu D. Wang D. Yang Q. Dong Y.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As such, a small molecule that could activate AMPK and inhibit Akt to prevent protein synthesis and NFAT activation could be an ideal treatment strategy for pathological cardiac hypertrophy. One molecule that may fit this criteria is the polyphenol, resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene). Indeed, in vivo administration of resveratrol (Resv) can blunt concentric hypertrophy and diastolic impairment in rats subjected to abdominal aortic banding (16Juric D. Wojciechowski P. Das D.K. Netticadan T. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H2138-H2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, despite this finding, it is not known if Resv mediates this anti-hypertrophic effect via changes in vascular function to reduce hemodynamic load (17Liu Z. Song Y. Zhang X. Liu Z. Zhang W. Mao W. Wang W. Cui W. Zhang X. Jia X. Li N. Han C. Liu C. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2005; 32: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) or whether Resv has a direct effect on the cardiac myocyte. Assuming the latter, the molecular mechanisms behind these changes are also currently unknown. Therefore, based on these previous findings, we hypothesized that Resv can activate AMPK and inhibit Akt in the cardiac myocyte, and that these changes result in the suppression of the p70S6K, eEF2, and NFAT signaling pathways leading to the subsequent inhibition of protein synthesis and the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Animal Care—All experimental procedures involving animals were approved by the University of Alberta Animal Policy and Welfare Committee, which adheres to the principles for biomedical research involving animals developed by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS), and complies with the Canadian Council on Animal Health Care guidelines. Cell Culture and Treatment—Cardiac myocytes were isolated from the hearts of 1-3-day-old neonatal rat pups and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium/Ham's Nutrient Mixture F-12 (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 16 h essentially as described (18Kovacic S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 39422-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). 24 h prior to the initiation of experiments, the medium was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin supplemented with 1× insulin, transferrin, sodium selenite (ITS)+3 liquid media supplement. All subsequent treatments of the myocytes were performed in this serum-free medium for either 1 or 24 h. Cells were treated with either 1 μl of 50 mm Resv (Sigma) to a final concentration of 50 μm or with 1 μl of 96% ethanol as vehicle (control), in the absence or presence of 10 μm phenylephrine (PE) (Sigma) for 24 h. The final concentration of ethanol in both instances was 0.096%. In some experiments, calcineurin inhibitors (500 ng/ml (416 nm) of cyclosporin A (CsA) or 150 ng/ml (182 nm) of FK506 (Alexis Biochemicals)) were used in combination with PE and/or Resv. In some experiments, cells were treated with vehicle or 100 μm Resv for 1 h. To visualize changes in cell size, myocytes were plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips at a density of 6.7 × 105 cells in 35-mm dishes, and treated as above. Cells were fixed and visualized using mouse anti-α-actinin (Sigma) and Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson Immuno Research) as described previously (19Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). All mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. [3H]Phenylalanine Incorporation—Myocytes were treated with [3H]phenylalanine (Amersham Biosciences) (1 μCi/ml) at the time of drug treatment, incubated for 24 h, and harvested for [3H]phenylalanine incorporated as previously described (5Chan A.Y. Soltys C.L. Young M.E. Proud C.G. Dyck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32771-32779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Cardiac myocytes or MEFs were harvested and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described (5Chan A.Y. Soltys C.L. Young M.E. Proud C.G. Dyck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32771-32779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) using a variety of phosphoprotein and protein-specific antibodies as indicated. Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from wild-type (WT) and AMPKα1/α2-null genotype mice were generated as we have previously described (20Laderoute K.R. Amin K. Calaoagan J.M. Knapp M. Le T. Orduna J. Foretz M. Viollet B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 5336-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). WT and Akt1/2-null MEFs were generously provided by Dr. N. Hay, University of Illinois. MEFs isolated from WT and LKB1-null genotype mice were a gift of Dr. R. Depinho and Dr. N. Bardeesy, Harvard Medical School. All experiments involving MEFs were performed in the presence of serum. Luciferase Activity and Calcineurin Activity Measurements—Myocytes were cultured as described above and infected with Ad.GFP or Ad.NFAT-Luc-Promoter adenovirus (Seven Hills Bioreagents) at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Cells were treated 24 h post-infection with vehicle or 50 μm Resv in the absence or presence of 10 μm PE for 24 h. In some experiments, 500 ng/ml of CsA or 150 ng/ml of FK506 were used in combination with PE and/or Resv. For MEFs, a MOI of 50 was used for each adenovirus. Then 48 h post-infection, cells were treated with 100 μm Resv or vehicle for 1 h. In some instances, cells were harvested with the reporter lysis buffer supplied in the luciferase assay system kit (Promega). For the calcineurin activity measurements, myocytes were harvested with the lysis buffer plus protease inhibitor supplied in the calcineurin cellular assay kit (BIOMOL). Samples were assessed as per the manufacturer's instructions. Calcineurin activity was also determined in an in vitro dephosphorylation assay using a γ-32P-labeled RII-peptide (corresponding to the regulatory domain of protein kinase A; the RII peptide, DLDVPIPGRFDRRVSVAAE) as previously described (21Fruman D.A. Mather P.E. Burakoff S.J. Bierer B.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2513-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of lysate was added to 15 μm γ-32P-labeled RII-peptide, and the reaction was carried out for 15 min at 30 °C in the presence of 1.5 μm okadaic acid with a total reaction volume of 60 μl. Following phosphatase reaction, the mixture was applied to an AG-50W0X8 cation exchange resin to separate out the γ-32P-labeled RII-peptide. Calcineurin activity was calculated based on the pmol of released phosphate/min/mg protein. Statistical Analysis—All data are presented as means ± S.E. of the mean (S.E.). Statistical analysis for comparison of two groups was performed with Student's unpaired two-tailed t test or two-tailed Mann-Whitney test as appropriate. For comparison of three groups, one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni multiple comparisons test was used for the determination of statistical analysis. In some instances, the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons test was used. Student's one sample t test was utilized in cases where the control was set as 1. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Resveratrol Inhibits Phenylephrine-induced Cellular Hypertrophy and Protein Synthesis—Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes treated with 10 μm PE for 24 h demonstrated a dramatic increase in cell size as well as a significant 1.89-fold increase in protein synthesis over control-treated cells (Fig. 1, A and B), which was reduced by simultaneous treatment of 50 μm Resv. To investigate the molecular signaling mechanisms that may contribute to the Resv-induced reduction in hypertrophic growth, cell lysates from cardiac myocytes treated with PE in the absence or presence of Resv were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-p70S6K (T389) and anti-phospho-p70S6K (T421/S424) antibodies. While p70S6K undergoes multisite phosphorylation, phosphorylation at these sites are closely related to an increase in its activity (22Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6242-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 23Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Although PE increased the phosphorylation status of p70S6K significantly compared with control, Resv was able to decrease p70S6K phosphorylation to basal levels (Fig. 1, C and D). Furthermore, immunoblot analysis of eEF2 using anti-phospho-eEF2 (T56) antibody as a marker of its activity (where phosphorylation indicates inactivation, Refs. 5Chan A.Y. Soltys C.L. Young M.E. Proud C.G. Dyck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32771-32779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 24Wang L. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Resv significantly increased eEF2 phosphorylation in cells in the absence or presence of PE (Fig. 1E). Resveratrol Inhibits NFAT-dependent Transcription as well as Calcineurin Activity—To further explore the possible mechanisms of action for the anti-hypertrophic effects of Resv, NFAT-dependent transcriptional activity was measured using a NFAT-luciferase reporter transgene (Ad.NFAT-Luc-Promoter) (3Wilkins B.J. Molkentin J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 1178-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Rat cardiac myocytes with adenoviral-mediated delivery of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the α-myosin heavy chain promoter containing multiple NFAT binding sites were treated with PE in the absence or presence of Resv. Myocytes treated with Resv displayed a significant and dramatic reduction in NFAT-dependent transcription compared with vehicle controls (Fig. 1F). To investigate whether the effect of Resv on NFAT transcriptional activity was mediated via modification of calcineurin activity, rat cardiac myocytes treated with PE were co-treated with Resv and/or known calcineurin inhibitors, CsA and FK506, at doses known to significantly reduce calcineurin activity in these cells (500 ng/ml (416 nm) and 150 ng/ml (182 nm), respectively (19Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar)). The data show that at these concentrations, Resv was significantly more effective at inhibiting PE-induced NFAT transcription than CsA and FK506 (Fig. 1G), and that there were no additive effects when co-treated with these calcineurin inhibitors (Fig. 1H). Interestingly, Resv was able to inhibit calcineurin to similar levels as that observed with CsA and FK506 using both the calcineurin cellular assay kit (Fig. 1H) as well as using the γ-32P-labeled RII-peptide in vitro dephosphorylation assay (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that an additional signaling mechanism is involved which results in a more pronounced reduction of NFAT-dependent transcription (Fig. 1G) beyond that observed via inhibition of calcineurin alone.

In accordance with increased phosphorylation of AMPK in Resvtreated cells, the level of phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which is also used as an intracellular marker of AMPK activation, was significantly increased (Fig. 2B).

Med. 2004; 10: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), we also investigated the involvement of Akt as a possible mediator of the effects of Resv in PE-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. Interestingly, we did not observe any changes in the phosphorylation status of Akt or its downstream target GSK-3β, in the presence of Resv compared with any other groups (Fig. 2, C and D) despite a previous report suggesting that Akt is inhibited by Resv in vascular smooth muscle cells (26Haider U.G. Sorescu D. Griendling K.K. Vollmar A.M. Dirsch V.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, cardiac myocytes treated with 100 μm Resv for 1 h and then rinsed and incubated in medium in the absence of Resv for 24 h, showed no changes in either the phosphorylation of AMPK or Akt (not shown), yet still displayed alterations in the phosphorylation of p70S6K and eEF2 (Fig. 2, E-G). These findings suggest that Akt activity may have been inhibited acutely by Resv, which had a longer lasting effect on the phosphorylation status of p70S6K and eEF2 despite Akt activity being normalized by 24 h. Based on these data, we investigated the effects of acute treatment of Resv in the cardiac myocyte. Acute Resveratrol Treatment Increases AMPK Phosphorylation and Decreases Akt Phosphorylation and Has More Dramatic Effects on the Phosphorylation of p70S6K and eEF2—Rat cardiac myocytes treated with 100 μm Resv for 1 h demonstrated a striking and significant decrease in the phosphorylation of p70S6K at both phosphorylation sites as well as a significant increase in eEF2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A-C). Consistent with these enhanced effects of p70S6K and eEF2 phosphorylation, AMPK and ACC phosphorylation levels were significantly increased with 1 h Resv treatment (Fig. 3, D and E). In addition, phosphorylation levels of Akt and GSK-3β were significantly reduced 1 h following Resv treatment (Fig. 3, F and G). Together, these data show that Resv is able to significantly alter AMPK and Akt activity despite the short treatment duration in the cardiac myocyte. Although this short treatment time with Resv precluded us from observing changes in cell size or measuring rates of protein synthesis, these dramatic effects on major regulators of protein synthesis are likely involved in the substantial inhibition of protein synthesis and cardiac myocyte cell growth observed with longer Resv treatment. The Effects of Resveratrol on AMPK Are Mediated via LKB1—In the heart, a major upstream kinase involved in regulating AMPK activity is LKB1 (27Sakamoto K. Zarrinpashneh E. Budas G.R. Pouleur A.C. Dutta A. Prescott A.R. Vanoverschelde J.L. Ashworth A. Jovanovic A. Alessi D.R. Bertrand L. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: E780-E788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Resv activates AMPK via LKB1, we utilized WT and LKB1-null MEFs treated with 100 μm Resv for 1 h. Consistent with what was observed in the cardiac myocyte, Resv treatment increased the phosphorylation status of AMPK in WT MEFs (Fig. 4A). However, Resv was unable to activate AMPK in LKB1-null MEFs, suggesting that the effect of Resv on AMPK is mediated via LKB1 (Fig. 4A). In addition, the absence of LKB1 had no affect on the ability of Resv to inhibit Akt (Fig. 4A), providing evidence that LKB1 is not necessary for Resv to inhibit Akt. Cross-talk between AMPK and Akt Is Not Involved in Mediating the Effects of Resveratrol—Because we (18Kovacic S. Soltys C.L. Barr A.J. Shiojima I. Walsh K. Dyck J.R. J. Biol.

In agreement with our previous findings, WT MEFs from both AMPKα1/α2-null littermates and from Akt1/2-null littermates demonstrated increased phosphorylation of AMPK following a 1-h treatment with Resv (Fig. 4, B and C). Furthermore, the absence of Akt1/2 had no effect on the ability of Resv to activate AMPK (Fig. 4C), and the absence of AMPKα1/α2 had no effect on the ability of Resv to inhibit Akt (Fig. 4B). Together, these data suggest that Resv exerts independent effects on AMPK and Akt, without subsequent cross-talk between the two kinases. As both AMPK (15Li H.L. Yin R. Chen D. Liu D. Wang D. Yang Q.

FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3311-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have been previously shown to regulate NFAT activation in the cardiac myocyte, we utilized our NFAT-luciferase reporter construct in WT, AMPKα1/α2-null, and Akt1/2-null MEFs. In both WT MEF populations, Resv significantly reduced NFAT-dependent transcription to ∼20% of that observed in vehicle-treated MEFs (Fig. 4, D and E), a value which is similar to that observed in cardiac myocytes. However, Resv failed to inhibit most of the NFAT activity in the nucleus in AMPKα1/α2-null MEFs (Fig. 4D), whereas Resv treatment inhibited NFAT-dependent transcription in the Akt1/2-null MEFs to a similar extent as in WT MEFs (Fig. 4E). These data indicate that the ability of Resv to inhibit NFAT transcriptional activity is dependent on AMPK and not Akt. Whereas previous in vivo studies in rats demonstrated that Resv is effective in preventing pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy (16Juric D. Wojciechowski P. Das D.K. Netticadan T. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H2138-H2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Liu Z. Song Y. Zhang X. Liu Z. Zhang W. Mao W. Wang W. Cui W. Zhang X. Jia X. Li N. Han C. Liu C. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2005; 32: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), the mechanisms involved in the anti-hypertrophic effect have not been clearly defined. Our data show that Resv is able to diminish the activity of both p70S6K and eEF2 (Fig. 1, C-E), suggesting that the anti-hypertrophic effects of Resv may be mediated by the inhibition of protein synthesis. In addition, our data show that Resv had a profound inhibitory effect on NFAT-dependent transcription in the cardiac myocyte, further suggesting that Resv can prevent hypertrophic growth by blocking NFAT-mediated regulation of gene transcription known to be involved in pathological cardiac hypertrophy (2Wilkins B.J. Dai Y.S. Bueno O.F. Parsons S.A. Xu J. Plank D.M. Jones F. Kimball T.R. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Moreover, Resv appears to exert its effect on NFAT in part by the reduction of the activity of calcineurin, an upstream regulator of NFAT, as well as an additional as yet unidentified signaling mechanism to achieve this dramatic inhibition of PE-induced NFAT activation (Fig. 1G). The ability of Resv to significantly block NFAT transcriptional activity via calcineurin and this yet unknown pathway could result in further suppression of the hypertrophic response at the transcription level, thereby strengthening the anti-hypertrophic effects of Resv. As such, Resv appears to prevent hypertrophic growth by inhibiting pathways involved in both protein synthesis and gene transcription. Because we have previously shown that pharmacological activation of AMPK by AICAR results in suppression of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy via inhibition of the p70S6K and eEF2 signaling pathways (5Chan A.Y. Soltys C.L. Young M.E. Proud C.G. Dyck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32771-32779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that Resv exerts its anti-hypertrophic effects via AMPK activation. In agreement with this, we show that AMPK is activated in the cardiac myocyte during both acute and chronic treatment with Resv (Figs. 2A and 3D) and that this activation not only affects the p70S6K and eEF2 signaling pathways (Figs. 1, C-E and 3, A-C), but also the calcineurin-NFAT pathway (Fig. 1F) to promote the inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, because a major upstream kinase involved in regulating AMPK activity in the heart is LKB1 (27Sakamoto K. Zarrinpashneh E. Budas G.R. Pouleur A.C. Dutta A. Prescott A.R. Vanoverschelde J.L. Ashworth A. Jovanovic A. Alessi D.R. Bertrand L. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: E780-E788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we examined whether AMPK activation by Resv was mediated via LKB1. Using LKB1-null MEFs we show that the presence of LKB1 is necessary for Resv to activate AMPK and that the nuclear localization of NFAT is regulated by the LKB1/AMPK signaling axis (Fig. 4, A and D). Although we did not measure AMP:ATP levels in Resv-treated cells, given that LKB1 appears to mediate the effects of Resv and that AMP does not activate LKB1 in a purified in vitro system (37Suter M. Riek U. Tuerk R. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Neumann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32207-32216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), it is likely that changes in AMP:ATP ratios are not involved. This is entirely consistent with what has been found in Neuro2a cells where Dasgupta et al. (38Dasgupta B. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7217-7222Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) reported no change in AMP:ATP ratio in Resv-treated cells yet a significant activation of AMPK. Whether Resv has a direct effect on LKB1 or whether it is mediated via another effector molecule is currently unknown. Indeed, as Resv is one of the most potent SIRT1 activators found in nature and AMPK activation was also noted in the livers of Resv-fed mice (39Baur J.A. Pearson K.J. Price N.L. Jamieson H.A. Lerin C. Kalra A. Prabhu V.V. Allard J.S. Lopez-Lluch G. Lewis K. Pistell P.J. Poosala S. Becker K.G. Boss O. Gwinn D. Wang M. Ramaswamy S. Fishbein K.W. Spencer R.G. Lakatta E.G. Le Couteur D. Shaw R.J. Navas P. Puigserver P. Ingram D.K. de Cabo R. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2006; 444: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (3672) Google Scholar), it is possible that one of the effectors responsible for Resv-stimulated AMPK activation via LKB1 is SIRT1. Indeed, evidence for this has now been provided in hepatocytes (40Hou X. Xu S. Maitland-Toolan K.A. Sato K. Jiang B. Ido Y. Lan F. Walsh K. Wierzbicki M. Verbeuren T.J. Cohen R.A. Zang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; Google Scholar). However, although we cannot rule out the possibility of SIRT1 regulating LKB1 activity, the effect of Resv on AMPK in neurons was shown to be independent of SIRT1 activation (38Dasgupta B. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7217-7222Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have previously shown that pharmacological activators of AMPK that are distinct from Resv also inhibit protein synthesis and cardiac hypertrophy (5Chan A.Y. Soltys C.L. Young M.E. Proud C.G. Dyck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32771-32779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), providing further support that SIRT1 may not be involved in this signaling pathway. In addition to the effects of Resv on the LKB1/AMPK pathway, our data show that Resv can also inhibit Akt activation. Although Resv has been shown to inhibit Akt phosphorylation and reduce p70S6K phosphorylation and protein synthesis stimulated by angiotensin II in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (26Haider U.G. Sorescu D. Griendling K.K. Vollmar A.M. Dirsch V.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), its effect on the Akt/p70S6K pathway in the cardiac myocyte was heretofore unknown. Interestingly, we did not observe any changes in the phosphorylation status of Akt or GSK-3β, the downstream target of Akt, in the neonatal rat cardiac myocytes treated with Resv for 24 h (Fig. 2, C and D) yet observed a profound decrease in Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation after 1 h of treatment (Fig. 3, F and G). Consistent with a decrease in Akt activity, we observed a striking and significant decrease in the phosphorylation of p70S6K and a significant increase in eEF2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A-C), suggesting dramatic inhibitory effects on pathways involved in regulating protein synthesis. However, Resv treatment inhibited NFAT-dependent transcription even in Akt1/2-null MEFs (Fig. 4E), suggesting that Akt signaling is not responsible for the inhibitory effects of Resv on NFAT transcriptional activity. That said, the Akt1/2-null MEFs still contain minor amounts of Akt3 activity (Fig. 4C), which may be sufficient to maintain Akt signaling. Although this is a possibility, we believe it is unlikely, because Resv is still able to increase phosphorylation of AMPK to the same extent as WT MEFs despite the dramatic decrease in Akt activity in the Akt1/2-null MEFs. This supports the notion that the effects of Resv on AMPK are independent from Akt. In contrast, Resv failed to inhibit most of the NFAT-dependent transcription in the nucleus of AMPKα1/α2-null MEFs (Fig. 4D), indicating that the ability of Resv to inhibit NFAT transcriptional activity is dependent on AMPK. While the majority of the effect of Resv on the nuclear localization of NFAT appears to be dependent on AMPK, there also appears to be at least one other AMPK-independent pathway that alters NFAT transcriptional activity in response to Resv treatment. Though it is tempting to speculate that the Resv-induced inhibition of Akt and increased activation of GSK-3β (Fig. 3, F and G) may also promote the nuclear export of NFAT, our finding that NFAT-dependent transcription was inhibited by Resv in Akt1/2-null MEFs to the same extent as in WT MEFs (Fig. 4E) does not support this concept. Furthermore, although we conclude that Resv can inhibit NFAT-dependent transcription in the MEFs, given the short duration of treatment with Resv in these cells, we cannot rule out the possibility that synthesis of the luciferase protein is altered by the p70S6K and eEF2 pathways independent from NFAT transcriptional activity. In summary, our data show that Resv can activate AMPK and inhibit Akt signaling in the cardiac myocyte, and that these Resv-mediated effects can inhibit cardiac myocyte hypertrophy (Fig. 5). Our data also show that the anti-hypertrophic effects of Resv can be attributed to decreased protein synthesis via inhibition of the p70S6K and eEF2 signaling pathways, and reduced NFAT translocation to the nucleus via calcineurin activity suppression. Additionally, we provide evidence that LKB1 is necessary for Resv to activate AMPK, suggesting that LKB1 and not AMPK may be a target of Resv. Taken together, our findings further support the growing body of evidence suggesting that AMPK activation has therapeutic potential for inhibiting hypertrophic growth and shed considerable light on the mechanisms involved in the anti-hypertrophic effects of Resv.

https://openalex.org/W2059981497,"The circadian clock controls the period, phasing, and amplitude of processes that oscillate with a near 24-h rhythm. One core group of clock components in Arabidopsis that controls the pace of the central oscillator is comprised of five PRR (pseudo-response regulator) proteins whose biochemical function in the clock remains unclear. Peak expression of TOC1 (timing of cab expression 1)/PRR1, PRR3, PRR5, PRR7, and PRR9 are each phased differently over the course of the day and loss of any PRR protein alters period. Here we show that, together with TOC1, PRR5 is the only other likely proteolytic substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFZTL within this PRR family. We further demonstrate a functional significance for the phosphorylated forms of PRR5, TOC1, and PRR3. Each PRR protein examined is nuclear-localized and is differentially phosphorylated over the circadian cycle. The more highly phosphorylated forms of PRR5 and TOC1 interact best with the F-box protein ZTL (ZEITLUPE), suggesting a mechanism to modulate their proteolysis. In vivo degradation of both PRR5 and ZTL is inhibited by blue light, likely the result of blue light photoperception by ZTL. TOC1 and PRR3 interact in vivo and phosphorylation of both is necessary for their optimal binding in vitro. Additionally, because PRR3 and ZTL both interact with TOC1 in vivo via the TOC1 N terminus, taken together these data suggest that the TOC1/PRR3 phosphorylation-dependent interaction may protect TOC1 from ZTL-mediated degradation, resulting in an enhanced amplitude of TOC1 cycling."
https://openalex.org/W2139426230,"In spite of its relevance to the origin of complex networks, the interplay between form and function and its role during network formation remains largely unexplored. While recent studies introduce dynamics by considering rewiring processes of a pre-existent network, we study network growth and formation by proposing an evolutionary preferential attachment model, its main feature being that the capacity of a node to attract new links depends on a dynamical variable governed in turn by the node interactions. As a specific example, we focus on the problem of the emergence of cooperation by analyzing the formation of a social network with interactions given by the Prisoner's Dilemma. The resulting networks show many features of real systems, such as scale-free degree distributions, cooperative behavior and hierarchical clustering. Interestingly, results such as the cooperators being located mostly on nodes of intermediate degree are very different from the observations of cooperative behavior on static networks. The evolutionary preferential attachment mechanism points to an evolutionary origin of scale-free networks and may help understand similar feedback problems in the dynamics of complex networks by appropriately choosing the game describing the interaction of nodes."
https://openalex.org/W2038593423,"Cues that reliably predict rewards trigger the thoughts and emotions normally evoked by those rewards. Humans and other animals will work, often quite hard, for these cues. This is termed conditioned reinforcement. The ability to use conditioned reinforcers to guide our behaviour is normally beneficial; however, it can go awry. For example, corporate icons, such as McDonald's Golden Arches, influence consumer behaviour in powerful and sometimes surprising ways, and drug-associated cues trigger relapse to drug seeking in addicts and animals exposed to addictive drugs, even after abstinence or extinction. Yet, despite their prevalence, it is not known how conditioned reinforcers control human or other animal behaviour. One possibility is that they act through the use of the specific rewards they predict; alternatively, they could control behaviour directly by activating emotions that are independent of any specific reward. In other words, the Golden Arches may drive business because they evoke thoughts of hamburgers and fries, or instead, may be effective because they also evoke feelings of hunger or happiness. Moreover, different brain circuits could support conditioned reinforcement mediated by thoughts of specific outcomes versus more general affective information. Here we have attempted to address these questions in rats. Rats were trained to learn that different cues predicted different rewards using specialized conditioning procedures that controlled whether the cues evoked thoughts of specific outcomes or general affective representations common to different outcomes. Subsequently, these rats were given the opportunity to press levers to obtain short and otherwise unrewarded presentations of these cues. We found that rats were willing to work for cues that evoked either outcome-specific or general affective representations. Furthermore the orbitofrontal cortex, a prefrontal region important for adaptive decision-making, was critical for the former but not for the latter form of conditioned reinforcement."

Methods A cross-sectional survey was used to examine medication use associated with injurious and non-injurious falls in 21,900 community-dwelling adults, aged 60 years or over from 383 Australian general practices recruited for the DEPS-GP Project. Falls and injury from falls, medication use, depressive symptoms (Primary Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)), clinical morbidity, suicidal ideation and intent, health status (SF-12 Health Survey), demographic and lifestyle information was reported in a standardised survey. Findings Respondents were 71.8 years (sd 7.7) of age and 58.4% were women. 24% 11% and 8% reported falls, fall related injury, and sought medical attention respectively. Antidepressant use (odds ratio, OR: 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 95%CI: 1.25, 1.70), questionable depression (5–14 on PHQ OR: 1.32, 95%CI: 1.13, 1.53) and clinically significant symptoms of depression (15 or more on PHQ OR: 1.70, 95%CI: 1.14, 1.50) were independently associated with multiple falls. SSRI use was associated with the highest risk of multiple falls (OR: 1.66, 95%CI: 1.36, 2.02) amongst all psychotropic medications. Similar associations were observed for injurious falls. Over 60% of those with four accumulated risk factors had multiple falls in the previous year (OR: 3.40, 95%CI: 1.79, 6.45); adjusted for other demographic and health factors. Interpretation Antidepressant use (particularly SSRIs) was strongly associated with falls regardless of presence of depressive symptoms. Strategies to prevent falls should become a routine part of the management of older people with depression."

Dawson V.L. Science. 2003; 302: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Pathologically, it is characterized by the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions (Lewy bodies (LB)) and dystrophic neurites (Lewy neurites) in surviving neurons, although the mechanism that underlies LB biogenesis is poorly understood (2Olanow C.W.

Neurosci. 2001; 2: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Furthermore, point mutations (A53T, A30P, and E46K) or gene multiplications of α-synuclein were proved to be responsible for familial PD (7Munoz E. Oliva R. Obach V. Marti M.J. Pastor P. Ballesta F.

Science. 2003; 302: 841Crossref PubMed Scopus (3387) Google Scholar). Thus, it is suggested that α-synuclein plays a key role in the neurodegenerative process of synucleinopathies (11Xu J. Kao S.Y. Lee F.J. Song W. Jin L.W. Yankner B.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 600-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that α-synuclein undergoes several post-translational modifications (5Dev K.K. Hofele K. Barbieri S. Buchman V.L. van der Putten H. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 14-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Among them, serine 129 phosphorylation is thought to be one of the most important events (12Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M.

Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S. Shen J. Takio K. Iwatsubo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and that the serine 129 phosphorylation is closely associated with aggregate formation in cellular models (16Smith W.W. Margolis R.L. Li X. Troncoso J.C. Lee M.K. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Iwatsubo T. Ross C.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5544-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, it has not been clarified whether the serine 129 phosphorylation plays a critical role in the pathomechanisms of neuronal death.

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases (17Olanow C.W. Tatton W.G. Annu. Rev.

The administration of rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, induced the major pathological and behavioral features of PD in animal and cellular models (19Betarbet R. Sherer T.B.

We established α-synuclein-overexpressing cell lines, which reproduced LB-like inclusions when exposed to ROS-inducing reagents including rotenone (21Matsuzaki M. Hasegawa T. Takeda A. Kikuchi A. Furukawa K. Kato Y. Itoyama Y. Brain Res. 2004; 1004: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is still elusive whether aggregate formation is an adaptive response or is directly related to neuronal cell death (23Periquet M. Fulga T. Myllykangas L. Schlossmacher M.G. Feany M.B. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 3338-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, mounting evidence suggests that such protein aggregates may not directly trigger the cell death process in neurodegeneration (24Lansbury P.T. Lashuel H.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 25Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). The aggregate formation is promoted by incorrect protein structures (26Volles M.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7871-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). As adaptive responses against the accumulation of misfolded or difficult to fold proteins, the unfolded protein response (UPR) regulates both protein translation and gene transcription to help the function. Thus, the UPR induction is cytoprotective, but if it fails to remedy the situation, the ER function is disrupted, and apoptosis is initiated (27Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar). It was revealed that α-synuclein blocks ER-Golgi trafficking and induces UPR in a yeast model (28Cooper A.A. Gitler A.D. Cashikar A. Haynes C.M. Hill K.J. Bhullar B. Liu K. Xu K. Strathearn K.E. Liu F. Cao S. Caldwell K.A. Caldwell G.A. Marsischky G. Kolodner R.D. Labaer J. Rochet J.C. Bonini N.M. Lindquist S. Science. 2006; 313: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in the familial PD-related gene, parkin, are also associated with ER-mediated UPR (29Imai Y. Soda M. Inoue H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Takahashi R. Cell. 2001; 105: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the UPR pathway may constitute common pathomechanisms in nigral degeneration. In this study using a cellular model overexpressing wild type (WT) α-synuclein, we showed that the appearance of UPR markers, especially activation of the PERK (PKR-like ER kinase) pathway, was evident several hours before disruption of the mitochondria. In contrast, the S129A α-synuclein-expressing cells showed much less UPR induction. Our data suggested that phosphorylation of α-synuclein at serine 129 plays a key role in α-synuclein-related cell death, which is triggered by UPR activation. Expression Construct and Cell Culture—The WT α-synuclein cDNA was subcloned into the pUC18 vector at SalI and SphI sites and the S129A mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Takara LA PCR™ in vitro mutagenesis kit; Takara Biomedicals, Tokyo, Japan). The cDNAs were introduced into the eukaryotic episomal vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen). In a mock construct, the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene was substituted for α-synuclein. The SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% of CO2 and were transfected by these constructs using DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-Dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl-sulfate) lipofection system (Roche Applied Science). To evaluate cell viability, transfected cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates and allowed to grow in regular medium for 24 h, and then the cultures were exposed to 10 nm of rotenone (Sigma) for 24 to 120 h. Cell survival rates were evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethelthiazo-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Immunocytochemistry—Cells grown on poly-l-lysine coated coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After a brief wash with PBS, the cells were incubated in a blocking solution (1.5% normal goat serum in PBS) with 10 μg/ml of RNase for 30 min and treated with the primary antibodies (described below) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescent dye (Alexa 488 and/or Alexa 568)-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (1:1000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. The nuclei were counterstained with TO-PRO3 (Molecular Probes). Fluorescent images were analyzed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoview FV300, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). To evaluate the effect of α-synuclein toxicity on the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), we adopted a fluorescent indicator, JC-1 (10 mg/ml for 10min, Molecular Probes) (30Smiley S.T. Reers M. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Lin M. Chen A. Smith T.W. Steele Jr., G.D. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3671-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). All of the images were scanned by laser scanning microscope in identical conditions of 512 × 512, 12 bit/pixel resolution, the photo multiplier tube voltages of argon and krypton were 630, and the gain and the background offset were 0. At each time point, 10–20 cells in six randomly chosen fields were analyzed to evaluate the 527:590 nm signal ratio by using the macro program in the Image-Pro Plus software (MediaCybernetics; Bethesda, MD). Intracellular ROS were detected by the 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF) diacetate (Molecular Probes) as a fluorescent probe. Briefly, after washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 20 min. Following extensive washing in PBS, the intracellular levels of ROS were evaluated by laser scanning microscope. Four-micrometer-thick, paraffin-embedded sections including the substantia nigra, locus ceruleus, and dorsal vagal nucleus from five patients with PD were subjected to immunohistochemical investigations using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method with a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Monoclonal antibody against β-COP (β-coat protein, 1:100; Sigma) was used as primary antibody. The sections were pretreated by heating for 15 min at 121 °C. Diaminobenzidine was used as the chromogen. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Immunoblot Analyses—After treatment with rotenone for the preparation of whole cell lysates, the cells were washed three times with PBS and sonicated in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 8% SDS, 1% Tween 20 containing the protease inhibitors, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml of pepstain A, 5 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml of aprotinin. Twenty microgram of total protein determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (described below) for 60 min. After vigorous washing, a rabbit anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:2000; DAKO, Denmark) or goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used as secondary antibodies and developed by using an ECL detection kit (GE Healthcare) combined with an image analyzer (LAS-3000; Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). Immunoprecipitation and Casein Kinase Reaction—For immunoprecipitation, the cells were washed with TS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) and harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml of pepstain A, 5 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml of aprotinin, pH 7.5). The lysates were sonicated and centrifuged 12,000 × g for 5 min, and supernatants were isolated. Equal amounts of protein were incubated with 10 μg of a monoclonal antibody against α-synuclein (Millipore; syn211) at 4 °C overnight and then incubated with protein G plus agarose (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C 1 h. For serine phosphorylation, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) and incubated with 1,000 units of casein kinase 2 (CK2; New England Biolabs) in the presence of 0.2 mm of ATP for 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 3 min and separated on a SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected with either an anti-α-synuclein antibody or an anti-phosphorylated α-synuclein antibody. For the experiment of casein kinase inhibition, the cells were incubated with rotenone in the presence of CK2 inhibitor (DMAT (2-Dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole); calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany, 1 μm). To examine the effect of CK2 inhibitor on eIF2α phosphorylation, SH-SY5Y cell lines were incubated with 10 μg/μl of tunicamycin (Calbiochem) and 0.2–5 μm of DMAT. Protein samples from these cells were analyzed by Western blots. Real Time PCR—Total RNA samples were isolated by using the acid phenol method (RNA-bee; Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA was synthesized from RNA samples using SuperScriptIII (Invitrogen) containing oligo(dT)20. Quantitative real time PCR was run in LightCycler1.0 (Roche Applied Science). The relative amounts of mRNAs were calculated from the second derivative maximum method using β-actin as a control. Primer sequences were designed by the Universal Probe Library Assay Design Center (Roche Applied Science). The following primers were used: BiP forward, AGCTGTAGCGTATGGTGCTG; BiP reverse, AAGGGGACATACATCAAGCAG; Erdj4 forward CCACCCTGACAAAAATAAGAGC; Erdj4 reverse, CGTCTATTAGCATCTGAGAGTGTTTC; CHOP forward, AGCTGGAACCTGAGGAGAGA; CHOP reverse, TGGATCAGTCTGGAAAAGCA; β-actin forward, CCAACCGCGAGAAGATGA; andβ-actin reverse, CCAGAGGCGTACAGGGATAG. Assay for Proteasome Activity—The proteasome activity was quantified using a 20 S proteasome assay kit (Affinity Research Product, Exeter, UK). Briefly, the cells were washed three times with PBS, resuspended into a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2 and then lysed by a brief sonication. The lysates were incubated with the fluorogenic substrate, Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC, at 37 °C for 30 min. The proteasome activity was detected by changes in fluorescence intensity at 355 nm of excitation and 460 nm of emission using an automatic multi-well fluorometer (Fluoroscan Ascent; Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). The relative activity was standardized by the protein concentrations determined by the BCA method. Antibodies—The following primary antibodies were used in immunocytochemistry and Western blots: mouse monoclonal anti-α-synuclein antibody (LB509; Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), rabbit polyclonal anti-α-synuclein antibodies (AB5038; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), mouse anti-α-synuclein phosphorylated at serine 129 monoclonal antibody (Pser#64; WAKO, Osaka, Japan), rabbit anti-α-synuclein phosphorylated at serine 129 polyclonal antibodies (gift from Dr. Iwatsubo), mouse monoclonal anti-β-COP antibody (Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-ERGIC-53 antibody (LifeSpan Biosciences, Seattle, WA), mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody (Sigma), lysosome (Lysotracker; Invitrogen), rabbit polyclonal ER antibodies (PDI; Stressgen, Victoria, Canada), rabbit polyclonal Golgi antibodies (NUCB; AVIVA systems biology, San Diego, CA), rabbit polyclonal anti-activated caspase-9 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), rabbit polyclonal anti-activated caspase-3 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-IRE1α antibodies (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-PERK antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-eIF2α antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), and rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-JNK antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Statistical Analyses—The data were analyzed by one-way analyses of variance and posts hoc multiple comparison using Newman-Keul's multiple comparison test or two-way analyses of variance and posts hoc multiple comparison using Bonferroni's test on GraphPad Prism version 4.03 for Windows (Graph-Pad Software, San Diego, CA). Low Dose and Long Time Exposure of Rotenone Preferentially Induced Intracellular Aggregates in α-Synuclein-overexpressing Cells—Following the transfection of WT or S129A mutant α-synuclein constructs, the immunocytochemical examination demonstrated diffuse staining of α-synuclein in the entire cytoplasm. There were no obvious changes in the growth and morphology of these transfected cells as previously described (21Matsuzaki M. Hasegawa T. Takeda A. Kikuchi A. Furukawa K. Kato Y. Itoyama Y. Brain Res. 2004; 1004: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Western blot revealed that there were no differences in the expression levels and molecular sizes between WT and S129A-expressing cells, although the latter failed to show positive bands for anti-phosphorylated α-synuclein antibody (Fig. 1A). To confirm the loss of phosphorylation at serine 129 in the S129A mutant, the cells were stained by anti-phosphorylated α-synuclein monoclonal antibody (Pser#64) (12Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S. Shen J. Takio K. Iwatsubo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and the signal intensities per cell were quantified. The signal intensities in WT α-synuclein-expressing cells were significantly higher than those in the other two cell lines (Fig. 1B). To evaluate amounts of phosphorylated α-synuclein after a short time of (6 h) exposure of rotenone, immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted using an antibody recognizing α-synuclein, and then a part of immunoprecipitates was incubated with CK2. The samples were analyzed on Western blots using antibody against α-synuclein or that of phosphorylated form. Increased amounts of phosphorylated α-synuclein were evident after rotenone exposure (Fig. 1C). When the amount of phosphorylated α-synuclein following CK2 treatment (Fig. 1C, lane 3) was defined as 100%, ∼50% of α-synuclein was phosphorylated in untreated α-synuclein-overexpressing cells, and 80% was phosphorylated following rotenone treatment (Fig. 1D). The data were quantified by densitometry from four independent experiments of Western blots (Fig. 1D). After 120 h of treatment with rotenone (10 nm), intracellular aggregates were observed in WT α-synuclein-expressing cells (Fig. 2A). The aggregates were immunopositive for anti-α-synuclein, anti-phosphorylated α-synuclein, anti-ubiquitin, and anti-neurofilament antibodies (data not shown). The aggregates were also co-localized with β-COP and ERGIC-53, the marker for the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (31Duden R. Griffiths G. Frank R. Argos P. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 649-665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) but not with a marker for ER, lysosome, and Golgi (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, some LBs in autopsied brain were also immunopositive for β-COP (Fig. 2C). After 24 h exposure, the cells expressing the S129A mutant showed much fewer aggregations compared with cells expressing WT (Fig. 2B), which was in good agreement with the previous reports (16Smith W.W. Margolis R.L. Li X. Troncoso J.C. Lee M.K. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Iwatsubo T. Ross C.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5544-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 32Chen L. Feany M.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). At 120 h of exposure, ∼10% of WT cells were aggregate-positive but only 1% positive of S129A cells (Fig. 2B). The incidence of aggregates was roughly dependent on the period of rotenone exposure (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Characterization of intracellular aggregations and their incidence in each cell line. A, the SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing WT α-synuclein showed intracellular aggregations after 120 h of exposure to rotenone at 10 nm. The cells were co-stained with polyclonal phosphorylated α-synuclein (Syn-p; panels a, d, and m), monoclonal phosphorylated α-synuclein (Syn-m; panels g and j), ERGIC (β-COP; panel b, ERGIC-53; panel e), ER (PDI; panel h), Golgi (NUCB; panel k), and lysosome (Lysotracker; panel n). In panels c, f, i, l, and o, the images were merged from each of left two ones, and the nuclei were stained with TO-PRO3 (blue). The scale bars indicate 10 μm. B, cells were treated with the same concentration of rotenone for 24–120 h, and then the incidence of intracellular aggregations was quantified. For each sample, eight random fields were selected for counting. The results were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance test and were shown as the means ± S.E. *, p < 0.05 versus both CAT and S129A; **, p < 0.001 versus both CAT and S129A.

LB in the locus ceruleus (panel a) and ring-like (panel b, center left) and homogenous LBs (panel b, center right) in the dorsal vagal nucleus were immunopositive for β-COP. The scale bars indicate 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) S129A Mutation Ameliorates Cell Toxicity Induced by α-Synuclein Overexpression—Because of initial medium changes for rotenone treatments, values of MTT assay were transiently decreased during first 24 h in all cell lines. However, after that, the viability of WT α-synuclein-expressing cells was dramatically reduced compared with those of CAT- and S129A-expressing cells (Fig. 3A). To assess whether apoptotic processes played a role in this cellular model, cells overexpressing CAT, WT, and S129A were double-stained by anti-α-synuclein and anti-activated caspase-3 antibodies after the treatment with 10 nm of rotenone for 0–120 h. In WT α-synuclein-overexpressing cells, activated caspase-3-positive cells were increased after the exposure to rotenone (Fig. 3B). The incidence of activated caspase-3-positive cells was significantly higher in the WT than in the CAT and S129A mutants after 72 h of exposure of rotenone (Fig. 3B). Thus, it is suggested that the cell death in this model was based on apoptotic processes. Mitochondrial Dysfunction Following Rotenone Treatment—To evaluate the cell death process in this model, we investigated the mitochondrial membrane potential by the JC-1 staining method, in which red represents a normal mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and green represents decreased mitochondrial membrane potential.

https://openalex.org/W2089443121,"In recent years, biotechnology and biomedical research have benefited from the introduction of a variety of specialized nanoparticles whose well-defined, optically distinguishable signatures enable simultaneous tracking of numerous biological indicators. Unfortunately, equivalent multiplexing capabilities are largely absent in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Comparable magnetic-resonance labels have generally been limited to relatively simple chemically synthesized superparamagnetic microparticles that are, to a large extent, indistinguishable from one another. Here we show how it is instead possible to use a top-down microfabrication approach to effectively encode distinguishable spectral signatures into the geometry of magnetic microstructures. Although based on different physical principles from those of optically probed nanoparticles, these geometrically defined magnetic microstructures permit a multiplexing functionality in the magnetic resonance radio-frequency spectrum that is in many ways analogous to that permitted by quantum dots in the optical spectrum. Additionally, in situ modification of particle geometries may facilitate radio-frequency probing of various local physiological variables. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a widely used medical diagnostic and research tool. Its performance is often enhanced using image contrast agents to brighten or darken regions of interest. Now microfabrication techniques from the microelectronics industry have been used to engineer colour, rather than grey-scale, contrast agents. The new system involves magnetic microstructures engineered to have distinctive spectral properties. Careful control of the geometry of the particles yields spectral signatures that produce characteristic 'colours' that are readily distinguished from one another. A family of magnetic microstructures that should enable similar multiplexing capabilities in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of biological samples have been developed. It is shown that careful control of the geometry of these magnetic particles yields well-defined spectral signatures in the radio-frequency spectrum used for MRI, effectively giving them characteristic 'colours' that can be readily distinguished from one another."
https://openalex.org/W2048962172,"The translation of the cyclin D1 and c-myc mRNAs occurs via internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated initiation under conditions of reduced eIF-4F complex formation and Akt activity. Here we identify hnRNP A1 as an IRES trans-acting factor that regulates cyclin D1 and c-myc IRES activity, depending on the Akt status of the cell. hnRNP A1 binds both IRESs in vitro and in intact cells and enhances in vitro IRES-dependent reporter expression. Akt regulates this IRES activity by inducing phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 on serine 199. Serine 199-phosphorylated hnRNP A1 binds to the IRESs normally but is unable to support IRES activity in vitro. Reducing expression levels of hnRNP A1 or overexpressing a dominant negative version of the protein markedly inhibits rapamycin-stimulated IRES activity in cells and correlated with redistribution of cyclin D1 and c-myc transcripts from heavy polysomes to monosomes. Importantly, knockdown of hnRNP A1 also renders quiescent Akt-containing cells sensitive to rapamycin-induced G(1) arrest. These results support a role for hnRNP A1 in mediating rapamycin-induced alterations of cyclin D1 and c-myc IRES activity in an Akt-dependent manner and provide the first direct link between Akt and the regulation of IRES activity."
https://openalex.org/W2032264216,"The kidney filter represents a unique assembly of podocyte epithelial cells that tightly enwrap the glomerular capillaries with their foot processes and the interposed slit diaphragm. So far, very little is known about the guidance cues and polarity signals required to regulate proper development and maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier. We now identify Par3, Par6, and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) polarity proteins as novel Neph1-Nephrin-associated proteins. The interaction was mediated through the PDZ domain of Par3 and conserved carboxyl terminal residues in Neph1 and Nephrin. Par3, Par6, and aPKC localized to the slit diaphragm as shown in immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Consistent with a critical role for aPKC activity in podocytes, inhibition of glomerular aPKC activity with a pseudosubstrate inhibitor resulted in a loss of regular podocyte foot process architecture. These data provide an important link between cell recognition mediated through the Neph1-Nephrin complex and Par-dependent polarity signaling and suggest that this molecular interaction is essential for establishing the three-dimensional architecture of podocytes at the kidney filtration barrier."
https://openalex.org/W1978224713,"Background RNases are currently studied as non-mutagenic alternatives to the harmful DNA-damaging anticancer drugs commonly used in clinical practice. Many mammalian RNases are not potent toxins due to the strong inhibition by ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) presented in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. Methodology/Principal Findings In search of new effective anticancer RNases we studied the effects of barnase, a ribonuclease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, on human cancer cells. We found that barnase is resistant to RI. In MTT cell viability assay, barnase was cytotoxic to human carcinoma cell lines with half-inhibitory concentrations (IC50) ranging from 0.2 to 13 µM and to leukemia cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 2.4 to 82 µM. Also, we characterized the cytotoxic effects of barnase-based immunoRNase scFv 4D5-dibarnase, which consists of two barnase molecules serially fused to the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of humanized antibody 4D5 that recognizes the extracellular domain of cancer marker HER2. The scFv 4D5-dibarnase specifically bound to HER2-positive cells and was internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The intracellular localization of internalized scFv 4D5-dibarnase was determined by electronic microscopy. The cytotoxic effect of scFv 4D5-dibarnase on HER2-positive human ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3 cells (IC50 = 1.8 nM) was three orders of magnitude greater than that of barnase alone. Both barnase and scFv 4D5-dibarnase induced apoptosis in SKOV-3 cells accompanied by internucleosomal chromatin fragmentation, membrane blebbing, the appearance of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, and the activation of caspase-3. Conclusions/Significance These results demonstrate that barnase is a potent toxic agent for targeting to cancer cells."

Previous studies have suggested that the lectin domain modulates the glycosylation of glycopeptide substrates and may underlie the strict glycopeptide specificity of some isoforms (ppGalNAcT-7 and -10). Using a set of synthetic peptides and glycopeptides based upon the sequence of the mucin, MUC5AC, we have examined the activity and glycosylation site preference of lectin domain deletion and exchange constructs of the peptide/glycopeptide transferase ppGalNAcT-2 (hT2) and the glycopeptide transferase ppGalNAcT-10 (hT10). We demonstrate that the lectin domain of hT2 directs glycosylation site selection for glycopeptide substrates. Pre-steady-state kinetic measurements show that this effect is attributable to two mechanisms, either lectin domain-aided substrate binding or lectin domain-aided product release following glycosylation. We find that glycosylation of peptide substrates by hT10 requires binding of existing GalNAcs on the substrate to either its catalytic or lectin domain, thereby resulting in its apparent strict glycopeptide specificity. These results highlight the existence of two modes of site selection used by these ppGalNAcTs: local sequence recognition by the catalytic domain and the concerted recognition of distal sites of prior glycosylation together with local sequence binding mediated, respectively, by the lectin and catalytic domains. The latter mode may facilitate the glycosylation of serine or threonine residues, which occur in sequence contexts that would not be efficiently glycosylated by the catalytic domain alone.

They also showed that the GalNAc density of peptide substrates with multiple acceptor sites after terminal glycosylation by hT2 and hT4 was reduced by mutational inactivation of the lectin domain binding. The lectin domain has been suggested to improve the kinetic properties of the enzymes toward partially glycosylated substrates, perhaps through simultaneous interactions of both domains with the substrates. These observations have led to the speculation that the apparent restriction of activity of isoforms ppGalNAcT-7 and -10 to glycopeptides is a property of the lectin domain of these enzymes (19Wandall H.H. Irazoqui F. Tarp M.A. Bennett E.P. Mandel U. Takeuchi H. Kato K. Irimura T. Suryanarayanan G. Hollingsworth M.A. Clausen H. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 374-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We have directly examined the role of the lectin domain in glycosylation site selection by hT2 (a peptide/glycopeptide transferase) and compared it to that of hT10 (a glycopeptide transferase). Comparison of the preferred glycosylation sites of hT2 with and without its lectin domain shows that the lectin domain determines the site of glycosylation relative to the site of extant glycosylation. Binding and pre-steady-state kinetic measurements of hT2 and its lectin domain-deleted form support the view that the lectin domain assists with both substrate binding and product release of glycopeptide substrates. For hT10, the data demonstrate that the catalytic domain directs glycosylation to residues immediately N-terminal to extant GalNAcs while the lectin domain directs glycosylation to sites distal from extant GalNAcs. Thus, the strict glycopeptide specificity of hT10 arises from a requirement for recognition of pre-existing GalNAc(s) on acceptor substrates either by its catalytic domain or its lectin domain. Construction and Purification of Lectin Domain Deletion and Domain Swap Constructs—The various constructs used in this study are shown in Fig. 1a. All constructs were cloned into the Mlu1 and Age1 sites of the Pichia expression vector, pKN55-N6His-TEV and expressed with a Tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease-cleavable His6 fusion tag. Residues 75–571 of human ppGalNAc-T2 encoding a portion of the stem region and the entire catalytic and lectin domains (hT2) and catalytic domain of hT2 (residues 75–440, hT2CD) were expressed and purified as described previously (16Fritz T.A. Raman J. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8613-8619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Residues 71–603 of human ppGal-NAc-T10 encoding a portion of the stem region and the entire catalytic and lectin domains (hT10) were PCR-amplified from RNA isolated from HEK cells (ATCC) using a NucleoSpin (BD Biosciences) kit. PCR amplification was done using a Superscript III one-step reverse transcription-PCR kit (Stratagene) and the primers 5′-ACCACGCGTTGAAAGTACGGTGGCCAGACTTT and 5′-ACCACCGGTCTACTGCTGCAGGTTGAGCGTGAA. The PCR product was cloned between the MluI/AgeI sites of pKN55-N6His-TEV. The catalytic domain of hT10 (residues 71–455, hT10CD) was PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-ACGACGCGTTGAAGGACTGGCATGACAAGGAGGCCATC and 5′-ACCACCGGTCTAGGGTGGGTAGAATTTGGGCAG and cloned between the MluI/AgeI sites of pKN55-N6His-TEV. For creation of the domain swap construct composed of the hT2 catalytic domain and the hT10 lectin domain, the hT2 catalytic domain (residues 75–440) was amplified using the primers ACCACGCGTTGAAAGTACGGTGGCCAGACTTT and TGCGGCCGGGGGCTCCACGGGTGGAACCCTTAACTCTGG (the primer encoding residues 435–440 of hT2 and residues 455–460 of the hT10 lectin domain). The lectin domain of hT10 (residues 455–603) was amplified using the primers CCAGAGTTAAGGGTTCCACCCGTGGAGCCCCCGGCCGCA (the primer encoding residues 435–440 of hT2 and residues 455–460 of hT10) and ACCACCGGTTCAGTTCCTATGAATTTTTCCAAGACTGT. These fragments were purified and mixed, and the full-length domain swap gene encoding residues 71–440 of hT2 fused with residues 455–603 of hT10 was generated by overlap extension PCR. The overlap PCR extension product encoding the domain swap gene was then amplified with the primers ACCACGCGTTGAAAGTACGGTGGCCAGACTTT and ACCACCGGTTCAGTTCCTATTGAATTTTTCCAAGACTGT and cloned into the Mlu1 and Age1 sites of the plasmid pKN55-N6His-TEV. The domain swap construct with the hT10 catalytic domain and the hT2 lectin domain was generated in a similar way. The primers used to amplify the hT10 catalytic domain were ACGACGCGTTGAAGGACTGGCATGACAAGGAGGCCATC and AGCTATATCCTGATGGTCCACGGGTGGGTAGAATTTGGG, and the primers used to amplify the hT2 lectin domain were CCCAAATTCTACCCACCCGTGGACCATCAGGATATAGCT and ACCACCGGTCTACTGCTGCAGGTTGAGCGTGAA. The plasmids were linearized and electroporated into Pichia pastoris strain SMD1168 to create stable transformants, and proteins were expressed in P. pastoris and purified as described (16Fritz T.A.

Peptide Synthesis—The MUC5AC peptide used for this study was synthesized by the Facility for Biotechnology Resources, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the National Institutes of Health, and glycopeptides MUC5AC-3, -13, and -3,13 were synthesized by Anaspec, San Jose, CA. The MUC5AC-9 glycopeptide was synthesized using Fmoc-Pro-NovaSyn® TGT (Novabiochem) resin, initial loading 0.20 mmol/g, to minimize problems apparently arising from dike-topiperizine formation, and with the glycopeptide synthesis following a protocol similar to earlier work.(21Liu M. Barany G. Live D. Carbohydr. Res. 2005; 340: 2111-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All the amino acid derivatives used were commercially available α-amino Fmoc-protected acids or pentafluorophenyl esters (in the case of Thr) with t-butyl protection on Ser and Thr side chains and Fmoc-Thr(Ac3-α-d-GalNAc)-OH for the glycosylated residue. The TGT resin (125 mg) was placed in a glass vessel (8.5 ml) containing a porous polypropylene frit for manual synthesis. Fmoc removal was achieved with piperidine-dimethylformamide (DMF) (1:4) for 20 min, followed by 2-h couplings of corresponding amino acid derivatives (4 eq), which were mediated by 2-(6-chloro-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethylaminium hexafluorophosphate (4 eq)/N-hydroxybenzotriazole (4 eq)/diisopropylethylamine (5 eq) in DMF (2 ml) at 25 °C. Double couplings were carried out on Fmoc-Thr(Ac3-α-d-Gal-NAc)-OH (2 eq, overnight and 0.5 eq, 2 h, respectively) as well as for the following two amino acid derivatives Fmoc-Pro-OH and Fmoc-Val-OH. Washings between reactions were carried out with DMF and CH2Cl2, then DMF again, and no intermediate capping steps were done. After chain assembly was completed and the N-terminal Fmoc group removed, the resin was washed with DMF and CH2Cl2 and dried in a desiccator overnight. Half of the glycopeptide resin was treated with trifluoroacetic acid/H2O (95/5) for 2 h to remove amino acid protecting groups. Separation and purification were carried out on semi-preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by treatment with NaOMe/MeOH (∼pH 9 as detected by pH paper) for 3 h to remove acetyl protecting groups on the GalNAc and lyophilization to give the final fully deprotected glycopeptide, confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (observed: [M+H]+, 1704.4; [M+2H]2+, 852.7; calculated: 1703.8).

MUC5AC-3,13 was varied from 46.8 μm to 3 mm, MUC5AC and MUC5AC-3 were varied from 3 μm to 200 μm, and MUC5AC-13 was varied between 7.8 μm and 1.0 mm with UDP-GalNAc at 115 μm (0.18 μCi/mmol) for reactions with hT2CD-derived constructs. For reactions with hT10CD-derived constructs, MUC5AC-3 was varied between 18.5 μm and 300 μm and, MUC5AC-13 and MUC5AC-3,13 were varied between 15 μm and 1.0 mm. Reactions with the constructs with the hT2 catalytic domain were stopped by addition of 75 μl of 30 mm EDTA and worked up as described (11Hagen F.K. Ten Hagen K.G. Beres T.M. Balys M.M. VanWuyckhuyse B.C. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13843-13848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). GalNAc transfer reactions using all constructs containing the hT10 catalytic domain were accompanied by a high rate of UDP-GalNAc hydrolysis in addition to transfer. This hydrolysis precluded the use of anion exchange to eliminate unincorporated GalNAc so these reactions were terminated by the addition of 75 μl of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and glycopeptide products were purified using Sep-Pak reversedphase columns as described (22O'Connell B.C. Tabak L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Radioactive GalNAc incorporation into substrate peptide, purified by either of the two methods, was determined by liquid scintillation. Pseudo first-order kinetic constants were determined by non-linear regression fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the program GraphPad, and the initial velocities were determined from duplicate measurements. Pre-steady-state Kinetics—Reactions containing 500 μm peptide and 114 μm UDP-[1-14C]GalNAc (0.18 μCi/mmol) were initiated by the rapid addition of enzyme to a final concentration of 0.7–6 μm and terminated by the addition of 80 μl of 30 mm EDTA at 0-, 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 30-, 60-, and 120-s intervals. Glycopeptide product was quantitated as described (11Hagen F.K. Ten Hagen K.G. Beres T.M. Balys M.M. VanWuyckhuyse B.C. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13843-13848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Data were evaluated for fit to both a linear and biphasic equation, and the best fit model in each case was used to determine kinetic parameters. Biphasic curves were fit by non-linear regression to the equation,[Product]=n[Enzyme](1-e-kfastt)+kcatt(Eq. 1) where, kfast and kcat represent the initial burst phase and the subsequent steady-state rate constants, respectively, and n represents the burst of glycopeptide formation per mole of enzyme present in the reaction (23Xu Y. Eads J. Sacchettini J.C. Grubmeyer C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3700-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Measurements—Spectra of enzyme tryptophan were recorded on a HORIBA Jobin Yvon FluoroLog-3 spectrofluorometer. Enzymes were diluted to 0.5 μm final concentration into buffer containing 10 mm MnCl2, 40 mm sodium cacodylate, 100 μm UDP, and various concentrations (500 nm to 300 μm) of peptide or glycopeptide and allowed to equilibrate for 5 min at room temperature. Emission spectra were recorded at 25 °C using a 3-mm/3-mm path length cuvette with excitation at 280 nm. Excitation and emission slit widths were set at 5 nm. Peptide concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence intensity at the emission maxima (330 nm for hT2 and 336 nm for hT2CD) at various concentrations of peptide (Fc) compared with the intensity in the absence of peptide (Fo) was used to monitor peptide binding. Dissociation constants were derived by fitting (Fc – Fo)/Fo versus [peptide] plots to a single site binding model by non-linear regression on GraphPad Prism (24Bashor C. Denu J.M. Brennan R.G. Ullman B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4020-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). SELDI-TOF-MS—Mass spectra were collected on a SELDI-TOF-MS PBS-II instrument using H4-RP assay chips and calibrated using the All-in-One Peptide Standard (Ciphergen). Spots were pre-treated with 5% acetonitrile, and 2 μl from reaction mixtures was spotted, allowed to dry, and washed three times with 5% acetonitrile. 1 μl of a 10 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid solution in 50% acetonitrile, 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid was applied to the spots, allowed to dry, and then used for data collection. Edman Sequencing—Reactions for identification of glycosylation sites contained 1 mm each of the peptide and UDP-Gal-NAc and, 4 milliunits/ml of the enzyme where 1 unit of activity is the amount of enzyme the catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of GalNAc transfer in 1 min for each enzyme substrate pair. MUC5AC-9 peptide glycosylations with hT10 were carried out at a peptide concentration of 500 μm. Reactions were allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C. GalNAc glycosylation site analysis was performed on a Procise 494 Edman amino acid sequencer as described (25Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26580-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Prior to sequencing, peptides were chromatographed on Sephadex G-10 (run in 50 mm acetic acid, pH 4.5, with NH4OH) to remove buffer and contaminants (2Gerken T.A. Raman J. Fritz T.A. Jamison O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32403-32416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Proline sequence cycles were employed at each of the Pro positions in the MUC5AC peptide to reduce sequence lag. Integrated peaks for the glycosylated and non-glycosylated Ser and Thr residues were further corrected for lag and preview as described (25Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26580-26588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After such processing the Edman sequencing-derived percent glycosylation at all initially glycosylated sites of the glycosylated MUC5AC substrates was >80%. The Lectin Domain of hT2 Directs the Site of GalNAc Addition to Glycopeptide Substrates—We showed previously that deleting the hT2 lectin domain compromised catalytic activity toward glycopeptide but not peptide substrates (15Fritz T.A. Hurley J.H. Trinh L.B. Shiloach J. Tabak L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15307-15312Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To further investigate ppGalNAcT lectin domain function, we mapped the sites of GalNAc addition catalyzed by hT2 with or without its lectin domain to a set of glycopeptides, derived from the sequences in MUC5AC mucin (Fig. 1b). As a reference, we also mapped the sites used by the same hT2 constructs on the non-glycosylated MUC5AC peptide. Edman sequencing of glycopeptide products obtained following the reaction of the MUC5AC peptide with hT2 and hT2CD showed that the preferred site of glycosylation on the MUC5AC peptide by these two forms of hT2 is Thr-9 (Fig. 2, a and e). Thr-3, -10, and -13 are glycosylated to a lesser extent. Substitution of the hT2 lectin domain with that from hT10 did not change the preference for Thr-9 (Fig. 2i). Thus, site selection on the MUC5AC naked peptide by hT2 is driven by local sequence recognition by the catalytic domain alone. In contrast, the lectin domain actively dictates site selection on the MUC5AC glycopeptides. As with the naked MUC5AC peptide, Thr-9 is the dominant site of GalNAc addition to the MUC5AC glycopeptides by hT2 in the absence of its lectin domain (Fig. 2, f–h). In the presence of the lectin domain, the site of glycosylation varied depending upon the location of the pre-existing GalNAc. For the MUC5AC-3 glycopeptide the residue most heavily glycosylated by hT2 was Thr-13 (Fig. 2b). Thus, the GalNAc on Thr-3 directed subsequent GalNAc addition to a residue 10 amino acids C-terminal to the extant glycosylation. The hT2 lectin domain targeted glycosylation to Thr-3, 10 residues N-terminal to the extant GalNAc (Fig. 2c), in the MUC5AC-13 glycopeptide. The most frequently glycosylated residue in the MUC5AC-3,13 diglycopeptide was Ser-5 (Fig. 2d). Thr-9 was not the preferred site of glycosylation by full-length hT2 for any of the MUC5AC glycopeptides, despite its availability, and in contrast to what was observed when the MUC5AC peptide was used as a substrate. The presence of the hT10 lectin domain was able to partially restore glycosylation to Thr-3 on the MUC5AC-13 glycopeptide (Fig. 2k) but not to Thr-13 and Ser-5 in the case of the MUC5AC-3 and MUC5AC-3,13 glycopeptides, respectively (Fig. 2, j and i). The Catalytic and Lectin Domains of hT10 Direct Glycosylation Site Selection—We next examined the roles of the catalytic and lectin domains in determining the sites of glycosylation for hT10, shown previously to have a strict specificity for glycopeptide substrates (12Nakagawa T. Martinez S.R. Goto Y. Koyanagi K. Kitago M. Shingai T. Elashoff D.A. Ye X. Singer F.R. Giuliano A.E. Hoon D.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 41"
https://openalex.org/W2162719167,"A major challenge in systems biology lies in the integration of processes occurring at different levels, such as transcription, translation, and metabolism, to understand the functioning of a living cell in its environment. We studied the high temperature-induced glycolytic flux increase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and investigated the regulatory mechanisms underlying this increase. We used glucose-limited chemostat cultures to separate regulatory effects of temperature from effects on growth rate. Growth at increased temperature (38 °C versus 30 °C) resulted in a strongly increased glycolytic flux, accompanied by a switch from respiration to a partially fermentative metabolism. We observed an increased flux through all enzymes, ranging from 5- to 10-fold. We quantified the contributions of direct temperature effects on enzyme activities, the gene expression cascade and shifts in the metabolic network, to the increased flux through each enzyme. To do this we adapted flux regulation analysis. We show that the direct effect of temperature on enzyme kinetics can be included as a separate term. Together with hierarchical regulation and metabolic regulation, this term explains the total flux change between two steady states. Surprisingly, the effect of the cultivation temperature on enzyme catalytic capacity, both directly through the Arrhenius effect and indirectly through adapted gene expression, is only a moderate contribution to the increased glycolytic flux for most enzymes. The changes in flux are therefore largely caused by changes in the interaction of the enzymes with substrates, products, and effectors.

Microorganisms encounter environmental changes, which they have to withstand and adapt to in order to survive. Changes in ambient temperature are common to almost every ecological niche. Temperature influences the structural and functional properties of cellular components, both physically and chemically. Physically, temperature affects membrane fluidity (1Kim I.S. Moon H.Y. Yun H.S. Jin I. J. Microbiol. 2006; 44: 492-501PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sasaki T. Konoha Y. Toyoda T. Yasaka Y. Przybos E. Nakaoka Y. J. Exp.

Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Chemically, temperature directly affects reaction rates in the cell. This study focuses on the adaptation of cells to temperatures higher than that optimal for growth.Microbes adapt to high temperature by altering their cellular make-up such as lipid composition, membrane fluidity, and the induction of large numbers of heat shock genes (3Riezman H.

Kline M.P. Bimston D.N. Cotto J.J. Essays Biochem. 1997; 32: 17-29PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3090) Google Scholar) or degradation of damaged proteins (14Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). Others are involved in the synthesis of the thermoprotecting disaccharide trehalose, which is known to be involved in stabilization of membranes and proteins (15Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 460-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 16Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) as well as in storage of free energy (17Thevelein J.M. den Hollander J.A. Shulman R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Many of these adaptive responses put a significant additional energy burden on the cells (18Verduyn C. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1991; 60: 325-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).There still is little clarity on the actual mechanisms by which cells maintain a balance between the energy needs for adaptive responses to stress survival and those for processes indispensable for growth. To shed more light on this, we quantitatively analyzed the behavior of yeast glycolysis upon a temperature challenge. This well studied catabolic route is central to the free-energy metabolism of the cell, although it is itself also subject to the effects of temperature fluctuations. First, temperature itself has a drastic effect on the catalytic properties of enzymes. The temperature dependence of catalytic rates is partially described by the Arrhenius equation (19Arrhenius S. Research on the Galvanic Conductivity of Electrolytes. Royal Publishing House, Stockholm, Sweden1884Google Scholar). According to this equation, an increase in temperature or decrease in activation energy will result in an increase in activity. Although this relationship may be valid, it represents an oversimplification because it does not take into account the temperature-dependent effects of allosteric factors, nor does it include temperature-dependent degradation. Second, changes in the concentration and/or catalytic capacity of enzymes can change the flux. Such hierarchical regulation could be effected at multiple levels as follows: transcription, mRNA degradation, protein synthesis or degradation, and post-translational modification. Finally, an altered flux could be regulated metabolically. An altered metabolite environment for any enzyme, such as increased substrate, decreased product concentrations, or changed effector concentrations, can drive an increase in in vivo reaction rates (20Suarez R.K. Darveau C.A. Hochachka P.W. J. Exp. Biol. 2005; 208: 3603-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Here we studied the quantitative effect of increased temperature on the carbon and energy fluxes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae both at the anabolic and catabolic level. Our data were subsequently subjected to regulation analysis (21ter Kuile B.H. Westerhoff H.V. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To this aim, we investigated whether the effect of temperature on enzyme rates could be included as a separate term. For most enzymes, this was the case. The analysis showed that the increase in glycolytic flux observed at higher ambient temperature is primarily regulated at the metabolic level, whereas contribution of hierarchical regulation and temperature effects is minor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Growth Conditions—S. cerevisiae strain CEN.PK113-7D (MATa MAL2-8c SUC2) was cultivated in 500-ml batch fermentors with water jackets (built in-house) for temperature control. Stirring rate was set to 600 rpm and an aeration rate of a fermentor volume of air per min. The culture was kept at pH 5.0 by automatic titration with 0.1 m KOH using an Applikon ADI 1030 Controller (Applikon, Schiedam, The Netherlands). The medium used for cultivation was based on previously described mineral medium (22Verduyn C. Postma E. Scheffers W.A. Van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1992; 8: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar), supplemented with 20 g liter–1 glucose. Alternatively, strain CEN.PK113-7D was grown in aerobic, carbon-limited 2-liter chemostats (Applikon, Schiedam, The Netherlands) with a working volume of 1 liter at a dilution rate of 0.1 h–1. Precultures were grown overnight in mineral medium with 20 g liter–1 glucose in shake flasks at 30 °C and 200 rpm. The medium used for chemostat cultivation was the same mineral medium as used in batch fermentors, however here containing 7.5 g liter–1 glucose. The stirrer speed was set to 800 rpm, whereas the pH was set to pH 5.0 and kept constant by automatic titration with 1 m KOH. The temperature of the chemostat was controlled with a heat jacket and a temperature probe. Stirring rate, pH, and temperature were kept constant using an Applikon ADI 1010 Biocontroller (Applikon, Schiedam, the Netherlands). The chemostat was aerated by flushing air at 30 liters h–1 through the culture. Steady states were verified by off gas analysis for oxygen and carbon dioxide and by dry weight measurements.Biomass Dry Weight Measurements—The dry weight concentration was determined in triplicate by filtering 10.0 ml of broth on pre-washed and pre-weighed cellulose acetate membrane filters (pore size 0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell). Each filter was washed with 10 ml of demineralized water and dried in a 450-watt microwave (Whirlpool Promicro 825, Sweden) for 15 min. Filters were cooled in a desiccator and weighed on an electronic analytical balance (Mettler-Toledo AB104, Columbus, OH).Off Gas Analysis—The oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the exhaust gas of the fermentors were monitored on-line using an oxygen analyzer (Servomex Ltd. Paramagnetic O2 transducer) and a carbon dioxide analyzer (infrared Servomex Xentra 4100 gas purity analyzer).Analysis of Metabolites—To analyze glucose, ethanol, glycerol, succinate, acetate, and trehalose, 1.0 ml of broth was quickly quenched in 100 μl of 35% perchloric acid. Samples were subsequently neutralized with 55 μl of 7 m KOH. Culture samples and media samples were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography on a Phenomenex Rezex ROA-Organic Acid H+ column using 7.2 mm H2SO4 as mobile phase. Glycogen was measured according to Parrou and Francois (23Parrou J.L. Francois J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To analyze residual glucose, 5.0 ml of broth was quickly (within seconds) filtered through 0.2-μm pore size filter (Acrodisc Syringe Filter, Pall Life Science, Ann Arbor, MI). Glucose analysis was performed spectrophometrically (Pharmacia LKB Novaspec II, Freiburg, Germany) using a Sigma glucose assay kit (catalog number GAGO20–1KT, St, Louis, MO) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Enzyme Activity Measurements—Enzyme extracts were prepared at 0 °C by adding glass beads followed by thorough sonication according to van Hoek et al. (24van Hoek P. Flikweert M.T. van der Aart Q.J. Steensma H.Y. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2133-2140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extraction procedure was modified to more closely resemble in vivo conditions by performing it in a buffer containing 100 mm K2SO4, 10 mm KH2PO4 at a pH of 7.0. Enzyme activity assays were carried out according to the protocol described by Rossell et al. (25Rossell S. van der Weijden C.C. Lindenbergh A. van Tuijl A. Francke C. Bakker B.M. Westerhoff H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2166-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which uses similar conditions for the determination of all enzyme activities. Assays were performed at both 30 and 38 °C. Protein determination of cell-free extracts was performed using the BCA protein assay method according to the manufacturer's specifications (Pierce).Glucose Transport Activity Measurements—Zero-trans influx of 14C-labeled glucose was measured in a 5-s uptake assay described by Walsh et al. (26Walsh M.C. Smits H.P. Scholte M. van Dam K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 953-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was carried out in growth medium at assay temperatures of 30 and 38 °C. The data were fit to Michaelis-Menten kinetics with one or two components with SigmaPlot version 7.0 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA).Distribution of Fluxes—Intracellular metabolic fluxes were determined through metabolic flux balancing using a stoichiometric model according to Daran-Lapujade et al. (27Daran-Lapujade P. Jansen M.L. Daran J.M. van Gulik W. de Winde J.H. Pronk J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9125-9138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).RNA Isolation—RNA was isolated from the cell using the hot phenol method (28Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). The amount of RNA was measured with the Novostar (BMG Labtech), and similar amounts of RNA were used in the cDNA reaction. Genomic DNA was removed by a DNase I treatment (1 unit; Ambion or Roche Applied Science). cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus H– (Bioke, The Netherlands) and hexanucleotides (Bioke, The Netherlands).qPCR 2The abbreviations used are:qPCRquantitative PCRHXKhexokinasePGIglucose-6-phosphate isomerasePFKphosphofructokinaseTPItriose-phosphate isomeraseTDHglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenasePGK3-phosphoglycerate kinaseADHalcohol dehydrogenaseLC-ESI-MS/MSliquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Analysis—Oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify an 80–120-bp amplicon. Protein-disulfide isomerase 1 (PDI1) was chosen as an internal standard. Primers were designed using Primer Express software 1.0 (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PCRs (10 μl) were set up and run as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, the reactions contained 5 μl of SYBR Green PCR core kit (Bioke, The Netherlands), 3 pmol of each primer (Biolegio or Isogen), and 0.1 μl of cDNA template (equivalent to 1 ng of RNA). Amplification, data acquisition, and data analysis were carried out in the 7900HT fast real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) (once at 2 min, 50 °C; 10 min, 95 °C; and 40 cycles at 95 °C, 15 s; 60 °C, 1 min). The calculated cycle threshold values (Ct) were exported to Microsoft Excel for analysis using the DDCt method (29Spijker S. Houtzager S.W. De Gunst M.C. De Boer W.P. Schoffelmeer A.N. Smit A.B. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 848-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and normalized to PDI1 and then to the 30 °C sample. Dissociation curves (dissociation curves 1.0 f. software, PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) of PCR products were run to verify amplification of the correct product.Analysis of Glycolytic Metabolites—Samples from at least two independent chemostat cultures were taken using a rapid sampling setup (30Lange H.C. Eman M. van Zuijlen G. Visser D. van Dam J.C. Frank J. de Mattos M.J. Heijnen J.J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2001; 75: 406-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and quenched using the cold methanol quenching method as described by Mashego et al. (31Mashego M.R. van Gulik W.M. Vinke J.L. Heijnen J.J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 83: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Glycolytic metabolites were analyzed by LC-ESI-MS/MS according to van Dam et al. (32van Dam J. Eman M.R. Frank J. Lange H.C. van Dedem G.W.K Heijnen J.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 2002; 460: 209-218Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and adenosine nucleotides were analyzed by LC-ESI-MS/MS according to Wu et al. (33Wu L. van Dam J. Schipper D. Kresnowati M.T.

All LC-ESI-MS/MS analyses were done in duplicate, and intracellular metabolite quantification was performed by applying the isotope dilution method (34Wu L. Mashego M.R. Proell A.M. Vinke J.L. Ras C. van Dam J. van Winden W.A. van Gulik W.M. Heijnen J.J. Metab. Eng. 2006; 8: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Immunoblotting—Cell-free extracts were prepared using a Fast Prep bead beater (Bio101 Savant, Inc.). To break the cells, 6 cycles of 20 s at speed 4 was sufficient. Between each cycle samples were cooled on ice for 60 s. Breakage of the cells was checked by microscopy. A protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was used to inhibit protease activity. The extracts were centrifuged 5 min at 10,000 rpm to remove insoluble particles. The protein determination of the extracts was performed using the BCA protein assay method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). Samples were assayed on a Phast System (Amersham Biosciences) using 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter by diffusion for 2 h, and the gel was stained afterward with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Subsequently, the filter was blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween and 1% Protifar (Nutricia, The Netherlands) and decorated with polyclonal antibodies against PGI, PGK, and TPI (Nordic Immunology, Tilburg, The Netherlands). GARPO secondary antibodies (Sigma), ECL detection, and densitometric scanning of the resulting film were used to quantify the bands with cross-reactive material.RESULTSIncreased Temperature Leads to an Increase in Glycolytic Flux—To study the effect of temperature on growth rate, S. cerevisiae strain CEN.PK113-7D was grown in aerated, pH- and temperature-controlled glucose excess batch fermentors at temperatures in the range of 27–41 °C (Fig. 1). First, in the lower temperature range, an increase of relative growth rate with temperature was observed, with a maximum growth rate at 33 °C. Increasing the temperature further to 37 °C had only a moderate effect, although further increase of temperature led to a decreased growth rate.To separate the effect of temperature on glycolytic flux from the effect of changes in growth rate on metabolism, we used carbon-limited chemostats, in which we set the dilution rate to control culture growth rate. We used a dilution rate of 0.1 h–1 to analyze the effect of temperature on glycolysis. Cultures were assumed to be in steady state when the O2 and CO2 concentrations in the off-gas were constant for more than 1 day (2.4 residence times). From these cultures the overall steady state carbon fluxes were analyzed. Fig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of fluxes and biomass dry weight. The concentrations of residual glucose, succinate, acetate, and pyruvate were below the detection limit in all cultivations. The specific oxygen consumption rate was constant (∼3 mmol g dry weight –1 h–1) at all temperatures, although there was no detectable flux toward ethanol in the range of 30–37 °C. Surprisingly, the latter steeply increased above 37 °C. This implies that in the range of 30–37 °C, the consumed glucose is completely respired, whereas above 37 °C cells grow with a respiro-fermentative metabolism, which yields less energy. We used the fluxes of CO2, ethanol, glucose, and glycerol to calculate the fluxes through the individual enzymes of glycolysis at 30 and 38 °C (Fig. 3). These conditions were chosen because they have the same μmax when grown in batch fermentors, and therefore the cells grow at the same rate relative to μmax (Fig. 1). We observed a 5–10-fold increased flux through all glycolytic enzymes in cultures at 38 °C when compared with 30 °C, and we asked how this increase was accomplished.FIGURE 2Temperature effect on physiological characteristics of glucose limited aerobic chemostat cultures grown at various temperatures in the range of 30–39 °C.

First, temperature could have a strong direct effect on the catalytic properties of the enzymes (19Arrhenius S. Research on the Galvanic Conductivity of Electrolytes. Royal Publishing House, Stockholm, Sweden1884Google Scholar), i.e. on their Vmax. Second, changes in the cellular content of rate-controlling enzymes could cause the flux increases (35Shulman R.G. Bloch G. Rothman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8535-8542Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Finally, changes in the metabolite environment of an enzyme, such as substrate and effector concentrations, could underlie the changes in flux (36Hochachka P.W. McClelland G.B. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 381-386PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, any combination of the above mentioned types of regulation could occur (25Rossell S. van der Weijden C.C. Lindenbergh A. van Tuijl A. Francke C. Bakker B.M. Westerhoff H.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2166-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).To assess the direct effect of assay temperature on catalytic properties of glycolytic enzymes, we determined the temperature dependence of the Vmax in vitro. The Vmax was measured at 30 and 38 °C in cell extracts from chemostat cultivations grown at 30 or 38 °C. In this way we were able to isolate the direct effect of temperature on Vmax from that of the adaptive response of the cell to the temperature increase. The latter might also cause changes in the catalytic rate of the enzyme in vivo.The direct effect of temperature on enzyme catalytic rates in cell extracts isolated from cultivations at 30 °C ranged from 0.6-fold, for phosphofructokinase (PFK), to 1.7-fold, for triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI) (Table 1). The rates of the other enzymes were not significantly affected by the increase in temperature. Similarly, in cell extracts isolated from cultivations at 38 °C, the direct effect of temperature ranged from 0.5- to 1.9-fold (Table 1). In these cell extracts the hexose transporters, hexokinase (HXK), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, and PGK did not show a significant change in Vmax when assayed at both temperatures. To show that we were not observing an artifact introduced by enzyme inactivation during the assay, we tested the activity of HXK, which belongs to the most thermolabile enzymes (37Zaitzeva E.A. Chukrai E.S. Poltorak O.M. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1996; 61: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), after incubation of cell-free extracts from steady states at both cultivation temperatures at 38 °C for 30 min. No significant decrease in enzyme capacity was observed (data not shown). The direct effect of assay temperature on activity of cell extracts from 38 °C cultivations was in most cases not significantly different from that on the activity of cell extracts from 30 °C cultivations (ratio 38/30 °C). Notable exceptions were phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), PFK, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (TDH) (Table 2), which suggests that their mode of regulation differs significantly at both temperatures.TABLE 1In vitro enzyme activity determination of S. cerevisiae cell-free extracts, grown in glucose-limited aerobic chemostats at 30 and 38 °CEnzymeCulture temperature 30 °C, assay temperature 30 °CCulture temperature 30 °C, assay temperature 38 °CCulture temperature 38 °C, assay temperature 30 °CCulture temperature 38 °C, assay temperature 38 °CAssay temperature effectCulture temperature effectABCDB/AD/CC/AD/Bmmol·min-1· g protein-1HXT0.3 ± 0.00.3 ± 0.00.2 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.01.11.00.80.7HXK0.4 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.21.31.41.41.5PGI1.0 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.21.11.5ap value <0.05 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.1.11.6bp value <0.01 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.PFK0.3 ± 0.00.2 ± 0.00.4 ± 0.00.5 ± 0.00.6bp value <0.01 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.1.2bp value <0.01 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.1.12.3bp value <0.01 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.FBA0.4 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.20.4 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.11.31.21.00.9TPI3.2 ± 0.55.4 ± 0.34.4 ± 1.18.3 ± 0.31.7bp value <0.01 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.1.9bp value <0.01 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.1.41.5bp value <0.01 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.TDH0.6 ± 0.20.5 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.20.80.5bp value <0.01 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.2.2bp value <0.01 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.1.5ap value <0.05 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.PGK3.8 ± 1.73.7 ± 1.711 ± 0.911 ± 0.91.01.02.8bp value <0.01 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.2.9bp value <0.01 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.GPM2.4 ± 1.42.0 ± 1.54.5 ± 0.34.1 ± 0.20.90.9ap value <0.05 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.1.9ap value <0.05 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.2.0ap value <0.05 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.PYK2.0 ± 0.91.5 ± 1.12.6 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.20.70.6bp value <0.01 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.1.31.1ADH2.7 ± 1.94.1 ± 2.02.0 ± 0.32.8 ± 0.21.51.4bp value <0.01 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.0.70.7a p value <0.05 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.b p value <0.01 was determined from a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance.

https://openalex.org/W2009610308,"Human triosephosphate isomerase deficiency is a rare autosomal disease that causes premature death of homozygous individuals. The most frequent mutation that leads to this illness is in position 104, which involves a conservative change of a Glu for Asp. Despite the extensive work that has been carried out on the E104D mutant enzyme in hemolysates and whole cells, the molecular basis of this disease is poorly understood. Here, we show that the purified, recombinant mutant enzyme E104D, while exhibiting normal catalytic activity, shows impairments in the formation of active dimers and low thermostability and monomerizes under conditions in which the wild type retains its dimeric form. The crystal structure of the E104D mutant at 1.85 Å resolution showed that its global structure was similar to that of the wild type; however, residue 104 is part of a conserved cluster of 10 residues, five from each subunit. An analysis of the available high resolution structures of TIM dimers revealed that this cluster forms a cavity that possesses an elaborate conserved network of buried water molecules that bridge the two subunits. In the E104D mutant, a disruption of contacts of the amino acid side chains in the conserved cluster leads to a perturbation of the water network in which the water-protein and water-water interactions that join the two monomers are significantly weakened and diminished. Thus, the disruption of this solvent system would stand as the underlying cause of the deficiency.

Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM 3The abbreviations used are:TIM or TPItriosephosphate isomeraseHsTIMhuman TIMMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. or TPI), a ubiquitous, essential glycolytic enzyme, catalyzes the interconversion between glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (1Albery W.J.

The functional structure of all known TIMs is assembled from monomers of about 250 residues into homodimers or tetramers. The crystal structure of the enzyme from 17 different species has been described, including the human enzyme (HsTIM) (3Mande S.C. Mainfroid V. Kalk K.H. Goraj K. Martial J.A. Hol W.G.

In humans, TIM deficiencies are a rare class of autosomal diseases that are clinically manifested by chronic hemolytic anemia, neuromuscular disorders, neurological alterations, and cardiomyopathy and that result in the death of affected individuals within the first 5 years of age. The deficiencies are due to mutations in the TIM gene, with the most frequent occurring in the codon for amino acid 104 that leads to the replacement of Glu by Asp (reviewed in Ref. 7Schneider A.S. Baillieres Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 2000; 13: 119-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In studies of hemolysates from patients affected by TIM deficiency, the activity of the enzyme is found to be more than an order of magnitude lower than in normal individuals. Further, this reduction is accompanied by accumulation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to levels several times higher than those of the controls (7Schneider A.S. Baillieres Best Pract. Res. Clin.

In addition, mutations in TIM may lead to the accumulation of methylglyoxal (16Ahmed N. Battah S. Karachalias N. Babaei-Jadidi R. Horanyi M. Baroti K. Hollan S. Thornalley P.J. Biochim. Biophys.

In these studies, it was observed that binding of the E104D and F240L mutants is higher than in the controls. The low TIM activity in TIM-deficient patients was attributed, at least in part, to this higher binding.

Phillips D.C. Maquat L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7903-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The data are consistent with TIM activity of affected individuals being substantially lower than in unaffected individuals; it was also shown that TIM activity in the E104D mutant is thermolabile (12Repiso A. Boren J. Ortega F. Pujades A. Centelles J. Vives-Corrons J.L. Climent F. Cascante M. Carreras J. Haematologica. 2002; 87: ECR12PubMed Google Scholar, 20Daar I.O. Artymiuk P.J. Phillips D.C. Maquat L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7903-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A two-hybrid system in yeast was used to explore the interaction between the two monomers of various mutant enzymes, including E104D (21Ralser M. Heeren G. Breitenbach M. Lehrach H. Krobitsch S. PLoS ONE. 2006; 1: e30Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In all cases, it was observed that there is a weakened interaction between the two monomers. Despite extensive work that has been carried out on the E104D mutant enzyme in hemolysates and whole cells, the characteristics of the purified enzyme have not been ascertained. Since the properties of the isolated pure protein were expected to provide direct evidence as to whether intrinsic alterations of the enzyme or external factors explain the measurements made in extracts or whole cells, we determined the basic biochemical and biophysical characteristics of recombinant E104D TIM and compared them with those of the recombinant wild type HsTIM. The data indicate that the kinetic parameters of the mutant and wild type enzymes are nearly identical. Determination of the thermal denaturation profiles by circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry revealed that the enzyme is thermolabile. In addition, the data showed that the wild type enzyme and the mutant enzyme have different thermal denaturation routes; wild type has two transitions, whereas the mutant has only one. Measurements of the stability and reactivation of the wild type and recombinant enzymes from unfolded monomers, obtained with guanidinium chloride, show that the mutant dimers are less stable than the wild type dimers and that the formation of active dimers from unfolded monomers is lower in the mutant enzymes than in the wild type. In regard to the atomic structure of the mutant enzyme, it is noted that the crystal structure of chicken and human TIM at 2.5 and 2.8 Å resolution, respectively, were previously used to explain the low activity that had been observed in patients affected by this mutation, which is located in the interface neighborhood of the enzyme, at ∼10 Å of the active site region. It was proposed that a counterbalance of charges in the zone would lower the stability of the dimer, with an eventual perturbation of the active site (3Mande S.C. Mainfroid V. Kalk K.H. Goraj K. Martial J.A. Hol W.G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 810-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 20Daar I.O. Artymiuk P.J. Phillips D.C. Maquat L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7903-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, we surmised that the crystal structure of the HsTIM E104D mutant would provide more accurate structural information. Indeed, the crystal structure of E104D HsTIM at 1.85 Å resolution revealed that the geometry of the catalytic residues was not modified and that the most important consequence of the E104D mutation is the disruption of a conserved water network that spans the dimer interface and appears to be essential for maintaining the stability of TIM dimers. Cloning and Purification of Wild Type Human Enzyme and Its E104D Mutant—The vector pARHS-HsTIM, encoding the protein sequence of wild type HsTIM, was kindly donated by Dr. Joseph Martial (Université de Liege). The HsTIM sequence was subcloned into the expression plasmid pET3b (Novagen). This vector was modified in order to introduce a His tag sequence on the amino terminus of the enzyme and, on a second round, a tobacco etch virus protease recognition sequence. In both cases, a two-stage PCR procedure was used, based on the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Novagen), as described in Ref. 22Wang W. Malcolm B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 182: 37-43PubMed Google Scholar. The mutant E104D was constructed on this modified plasmid using the QuikChange protocol. The plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol until an A600 nm of 0.6 was reached. At that time, they were induced for 3 h with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The same method was used to prepare the E104D HsTIM mutant. The pellet of cells from a 2-liter culture was suspended in 20 ml of buffer A containing 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazol. Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded on a column containing 10 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of buffer A plus 500 mm imidazole and dialyzed for 2 h against a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein was then cleaved using purified recombinant His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease expressed from the vector pRK508 (23Kapust R.B. Waugh D.S. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1668-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) and purified to homogeneity. The protease was added at a ratio of 1 μg of protease per 50 μg of HsTIM and incubated at 30 °C for 18 h. The mixture was then concentrated on Amicon Ultra filters (molecular weight cut-off 10,000; Millipore) and dialyzed against buffer A. The His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease was subsequently removed by batch treatment with 4 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. Protein samples were >99% pure (with no His-tagged protein or other contaminants) and homogeneous, as judged by denaturing and native gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Approximately 20 mg of pure protein were obtained per liter of culture. The enzymes were stored for up to 2 weeks at 4 °C in a buffer containing 100 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). Alternatively, the enzymes were precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 75% saturation and maintained at 4 °C. Enzyme Activity—This was measured in the direction of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The assay system (1 ml) contained 100 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, 0.2 mm NADH, and 0.9 units of α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (pH 7.4). Activity was calculated from the decrease of NADH absorbance at 340 nm in a Hewlett-Packard spectrophotometer with a multi-cell attachment at 25 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of enzyme, generally 2.5 or 5 ng. Denaturation and Reactivation of the Enzymes—Wild type human HsTIM and its E104D mutant were denatured by incubation with 6 m guandinium chloride for 1 h at 25 °C at a concentration of 500 μg/ml (9.2 μm dimer concentration) of 100 mm triethanolamine and 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). For reactivation of the enzymes, an aliquot was withdrawn and diluted at least 100-fold in 100 mm triethanolamine and 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). Reactivation of the enzymes was followed by the emergence of activity throughout time at 25 °C. In some cases, the reactivation reaction was determined at various protein concentrations; in all experiments, the concentration of guandinium chloride in the reactivation mixture was 60 mm; this concentration does not affect the activity or stability of the enzymes. Circular Dichroism—This was determined in a JASCO J-715 Spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc.) in a 0.1-cm cell. For the spectra, 350 μg of protein/ml were placed in 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The CD signal at 222 nm was also followed as function of temperature using a scan rate of 0.4 °C/min. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—All experiments were done in a capillary Valery Plotnikov Differential Scanning Calorimeter microcalorimeter from MicroCal (Northampton, MA). Protein solutions were prepared by exhaustive dialysis against the buffer (100 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) that was placed in the reference cell. Protein concentrations were determined from their absorbance at 280 nm. Experiments were done at several protein concentrations (from 0.1 to 1.9 mg/ml) and scan rates (from 0.5 to 2.5 °C/min). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 10/300GL analytical column (GE Healthcare) on anÁkta FPLC System (GE Healthcare). 300 μl of protein at a concentration of 25 μg/ml (0.5 μm dimer) were loaded onto the column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 250 μm EDTA, and 500 mm NaCl. The column was run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and absorbance was measured at 280 nm. The size exclusion column was calibrated with a gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad) containing the following globular protein markers (molecular mass and retention volumes are reported): thyroglobulin (bovine) (669 kDa, 9.8 ml), γ-globulin (bovine) (158 kDa, 12.9 ml), ovalbumin (chicken) (43 kDa, 15.8 ml), myoglobin (horse) (17 kDa, 17.7 ml), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa, 21.1 ml). Crystallization of the E104D Mutant of HsTIM and Data Collection—The mutant E104D was crystallized via vapor diffusion by the sitting drop method. One microliter of a solution of protein at 35 mg/ml was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution. Initially, needle-shaped crystals were obtained in the H9 condition of the Crystal Screen HT kit (Hampton Research). Further optimization yielded better shaped crystals after 1 or 2 weeks of incubation. The best crystals were grown at 9 °C and obtained with a reservoir solution of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 20% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000, 4% polypropylene glycol P400, and 10 mm NiCl2. The crystals were cryoprotected by increasing the concentration of polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000 in the crystal drop to 30%; they were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) 22-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory), using a MarMosaic MX-300 detector. The data were processed with MOSFLM (24Leslie A.G.W.

Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method with the program PHASER (26McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The existence of the E104D mutation was initially confirmed by difference Fourier maps calculated using the structure of the wild type enzyme. At the start, noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were used for the refinement, using one group that included the four monomers of the asymmetric unit. The restraints were released during the last cycles of refinement, before the addition of water molecules. On all four monomers, residues 31–37 (loop 1) and 170–177 (loop 6 or flexible loop) are less clear on the electron density map. These regions are normally poorly defined in all apo-TIMs. In addition, one of the monomers (D) is somewhat more disordered than the other three (residues 130–240), probably due to lack of crystallographic contacts, but the regions that comprised the interface and active sites were well defined. Five percent of the data were used to validate the refinement. Water molecules were first located automatically in COOT and validated if a peak was observed above 3σ on a difference map and above 1.5σ on a double difference map; the molecule had to have at least one polar contact between 2.6 and 3.5 Å. σA-weighted, Fo - Fc simulated annealing omit maps were used to further validate the quality of the model and the presence of water molecules.

The solvent-accessible surface area of water molecules was determined using AREAIMOL (25Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Superpositions and locations of conserved water molecules were made using the program 3dss (29Sumathi K. Ananthalakshmi P. Roshan M.N. Sekar K.

Liang J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W116-W118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). The Mutant E104D Has the Same Activity as the Wild Type Enzyme—In order to explore if the low TIM activity that is detected in hemolysates of patients that have the E104D mutation is due to an intrinsic low activity of the mutant enzyme, we determined the kinetics of wild type HsTIM and its E104D mutant. In the direction of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate, the Km values for the substrate were 0.74 mm ± 0.1 and 0.70 ± 0.15 for the wild type and the mutant enzyme, respectively, whereas the Vmax values were 7080 ± 415 and 6600 ± 354 μmol/min/mg for the wild type and the E104D mutant, respectively. The two enzymes exhibited classical Michaelis-Menten behavior. The Stability of the Dimers and the Formation of Active Dimers from Unfolded Monomers Are Lower in the Mutant E104D than in Wild Type HsTIM—Since it has been reported that in cultured fibroblasts and in erythrocytes from patients affected by the E104D mutation, TIM activity is thermolabile (12Repiso A. Boren J. Ortega F. Pujades A. Centelles J. Vives-Corrons J.L. Climent F. Cascante M. Carreras J. Haematologica. 2002; 87: ECR12PubMed Google Scholar, 20Daar I.O. Artymiuk P.J. Phillips D.C. Maquat L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7903-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we assessed the stability of the wild type and mutant enzymes at various temperatures. The incubation of the mutant enzyme at 36 °C or above (supplemental Fig. S1A) brought about a decrease in activity that was higher than in the wild type. The loss of activity at relatively high temperatures was significantly faster in the mutant enzyme than in the wild type; for example, at 48 °C, the E104D mutant lost most of its activity in 4 min, whereas in the same time, the wild type retained about 40% of its activity (Fig. S1B). The circular dichroism signals at 220 nm of the wild type and the E104D mutant were recorded as function of temperature (Fig. S2A). The E104D mutant exhibited a two-state denaturation profile with an apparent Tm at 49 °C. The wild type exhibited a different denaturation pattern. In the range of 47–54 °C, a plateau that reflected a partial loss of secondary structure was observed, but as the temperature of the cell was further increased, there was a complete loss of secondary structure with an apparent Tm of 60.4 °C. It is noteworthy that the CD spectra of the mutant and wild type enzymes are markedly similar (Fig. S2B). The heat denaturation patterns of wild type HsTIM and the E104D mutant were also determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The mutant exhibited a sharp peak with a Tm of 49.1 °C (Fig. 1). In contrast, the thermal denaturation profile of the wild type exhibited two transitions with Tm values of 47.7 and 61.5 °C (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. S1A, at 48 °C the wild type still retains about 40% of the initial activity, which indicates the presence of a dimeric state of the enzyme at this temperature. Thus, by differential scanning calorimetry criteria, the overall stability of the mutant enzyme is around 12 °C lower than that of wild type, which is in consonance with the CD data. No significant differences were found at other protein concentrations assayed. As the scan rate was decreased, the two transitions of the wild type and that of the mutant occurred at lower temperatures, indicating that they are all under kinetic control (data not shown). Thus, the mutation E104D causes a strong decrease in the kinetic stability. Second scans on the samples showed differential scanning calorimetry peaks that were only a minor fraction of those observed in the first scans, indicating that both the wild type and E104D mutant denature irreversibly when heated. To examine the stability of the E104D mutant quaternary structure, we incubated the mutant and the wild type enzymes at different concentrations for 2 h at 36°C; at that time, the specific activities of the samples was determined (Fig. 2A). Since TIM monomers are catalytically inert (5Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 6Zabori S. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Z. Naturforsch.

Tuena De Gomez-Puyou M. Gomez-Puyou A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3311-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), it was expected that at concentrations below the association constant between monomers, there would be a drop in the specific activity of the enzyme. This phenomenon was observed in both the wild type and the mutant enzymes; however, at protein concentrations in which the activity of the mutant enzyme was hardly detectable, the wild type HsTIM still exhibited substantial activity. The lower stability of the dimers of the E104D mutant upon dilution suggested that the mutation affects the association of monomers. Accordingly, we studied the formation of active dimers from unfolded monomers (Fig. 2B). We found that in both the mutant and the wild type enzymes, the extent of reactivation increased as the concentration of protein in the reactivation mixture was increased. However, at all of the concentrations of protein studied, the reactivation of the wild type was substantially higher than that of the E104D mutant. Because in the E104D mutant, the extent of reactivation was nearly the same in the range of 1–5 μg/ml, it is likely that in this enzyme, the association of"

It has been proposed that SLC5A8 might act as an apical iodide transporter in the thyroid follicular cells or as a transporter of short chain monocarboxylates. We have directly addressed the functional role of SLC5A8 in vivo by generation of SLC5A8 mutant mice. We found that SLC5A8 is responsible for the re-absorption of lactate at the apical membrane of the kidney proximal tubules and of serous salivary gland ducts. In addition, SLC5A8 mediated the uptake of lactate into colonocytes under physiological conditions. We did not find any evidence of SLC5A8 being essential for the apical iodide transport in the thyroid gland, even if the ion-cotransporter SLC26A4, causing the human Pendred syndrome, is missing. Because SLC5A8 is transcriptionally silenced in many tumors, it has been proposed that SLC5A8-mediated transport of butyrate suppresses tumor formation. Treatment of Slc5a8-/- mice with carcinogens and breeding to the Apcmin mouse line did not reveal a higher incidence of tumor formation. We conclude that SLC5A8 is instrumental in preventing lactaturia and loss of sodium-dependent uptake of lactate in the colon but does not have any apparent role in the prevention of tumor formation and growth.

We conclude that SLC5A8 is instrumental in preventing lactaturia and loss of sodium-dependent uptake of lactate in the colon but does not have any apparent role in the prevention of tumor formation and growth. Slc5a8 belongs to the sodium/glucose cotransporter family Slc5. Loss of function of these transporters may cause intestinal glucose/galactose re-absorption defects, glucosurea, or in the case of the Na+/I- symporter (NIS, 2The abbreviations used are:NISNa+/I- symporterWTwild typeKOknock-outSMCTsodium monocarboxylate transporterTSHthyroid-stimulating hormoneTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. SLC5A5) hypothyroidism in humans (1Wright E.M. Turk E. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 510-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). NIS is expressed in the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicular cells and mediates the uptake of iodide from blood into the cytoplasm of thyrocytes. Iodide is transported across the cytoplasm to the apical membrane toward the follicle lumen where it is oxidized and bound to thyroglobulin. A candidate molecule to mediate the efflux of iodide at the apical membrane is SLC26A4, which is mutated in Pendred syndrome, a genetic disorder that is associated with profound sensorineural hearing loss and goiter (2Fraser G.R. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1965; 28: 201-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 3Everett L.A. Glaser B. Beck J.C. Idol J.R. Buchs A. Heyman M. Adawi F. Hazani E. Nassir E. Baxevanis A.D. Sheffield V.C. Green E.D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). It has been shown in vitro in a polarized cell system that SLC26A4 can mediate the efflux of iodide via the apical membrane of a cell (4Gillam M.P. Sidhaye A.R. Lee E.J. Rutishauser J. Stephan C.W. Kopp P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13004-13010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a knockout mouse model for Slc26a4 does not show any signs of thyroid dysfunction, challenging the role of Pendrin in iodide transport at the apical membrane of thyrocytes (5Everett L.A. Belyantseva I.A. Noben-Trauth K. Cantos R. Chen A. Thakkar S.I. Hoogstraten-Miller S.L. Kachar B. Wu D.K. Green E.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). SLC5A8 was first described as a close structural relative of human NIS (46% identity and 70% similarity), but in contrast to NIS, it is expressed at the apical membrane of thyrocytes (6Rodriguez A.M. Perron B. Lacroix L. Caillou B. Leblanc G. Schlumberger M. Bidart J.M. Pourcher T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 3500-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The expression of SLC5A8 reduces iodide accumulation in NIS-transfected COS-7 cells, compatible with a role of SLC5A8 as a transporter that may mediate the flux of iodide ions into the follicular lumen of the thyroid (6Rodriguez A.M. Perron B. Lacroix L. Caillou B. Leblanc G. Schlumberger M. Bidart J.M. Pourcher T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 3500-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, SLC5A8 was designated human Apical Iodide Transporter (hAIT). Later it was shown that SLC5A8 overexpressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes mediates the sodium-coupled transport of monocarboxylates like l-lactate, propionate, butyrate, or nicotinate, whereas exposure to iodide or bromate did not lead to currents (7Coady M.J.

The sodium-dependent transport of monocarboxylates by SLC5A8 was also corroborated in a mammalian expression system (10Gopal E. Fei Y.J. Sugawara M. Miyauchi S. Zhuang L. Martin P. Smith S.B.

Na+/I- symporter wild type knock-out sodium monocarboxylate transporter thyroid-stimulating hormone tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. Because of glomerular filtration of lactate from blood to primary urine, lactate needs to be re-absorbed efficiently in the kidney to prevent lactaturia. Several studies suggest a sodium-dependent lactate re-absorption in the brush border membrane of the renal proximal tubule (11Barac-Nieto M. Murer H. Kinne R. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: F496-F506PubMed Google Scholar). SLC5A8 has been considered to be instrumental in lactate re-absorption in the S3 segment of the renal proximal tubule (10Gopal E. Fei Y.J.

However, clear evidence for the role of SLC5A8 in lactate re-absorption in the kidney is still lacking. In addition to its physiological function in homeostasis of short monocarboxylates, a number of reports suggested a role for SLC5A8 in carcinogenesis. Because exon 1 of the SLC5A8 gene is aberrantly methylated in 59% of primary human colon cancers and in 52% of the analyzed colon cancer cell lines, it was proposed that SLC5A8 might act as a tumor suppressor gene (15Li H. Myeroff L. Smiraglia D. Romero M.F. Pretlow T.P. Kasturi L. Lutterbaugh J. Rerko R.M. Casey G. Issa J.P. Willis J. Willson J.K. Plass C. Markowitz S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was claimed that SLC5A8-mediated transport of butyrate might serve as the molecular basis for the tumor suppressive role of SLC5A8 (19Ganapathy V. Gopal E. Miyauchi S. Prasad P.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that SLC5A8 is expressed in the apical membranes of cells in the kidney, intestine, thyroid, and salivary gland, but not in the brain, as defined by RNA in situ hybridization and a newly derived antibody directed against the C terminus of the protein. The generation of a loss of function mouse model of Slc5a8 revealed that SLC5A8 is essential for lactate re-absorption in the kidney and for adjusting lactate concentration in saliva. But it is dispensable for iodide transport in the thyroid gland even in the absence of the ion-cotransporter SLC26A4 responsible for the human Pendred syndrome. In the colon, we detected a sodium-dependent current induced by an addition of lactate to the luminal side that was mediated by SLC5A8, while no evidence was found for a SLC5A8-dependent butyrate transport in the colon. Our study reveals that SLC5A8 has no apparent role in the prevention of tumor formation and growth in the colon. Targeting Construct and Mutant Mice—The mouse genomic clone was derived from a 129/ola cosmid library. A loxP-flanked neomycin-resistance cassette was inserted into a BamHI site in front of the fourth exon. A loxP site was inserted into the HpaI site following the fifth exon of Slc5a8 (NP_145423.2). The resulting targeting vector contained 10.9 kb of 5′- and 6.1 kb of 3′-flanking sequence (Fig. 1A). Mouse embryonic stem cells were electroporated, and mouse lines recombinant for the Slc5a8 locus were established from two independent ES clones. Heterozygous animals of each clone were mated to Meu-Cre40 mice (20Leneuve P. Colnot S. Hamard G. Francis F. Niwa-Kawakita M. Giovannini M. Holzenberger M.

The loss of exons 4 and 5 results in a frameshift and truncation of the SLC5A8 protein after 4 of at least 10 transmembrane domains. The study was performed in a mixed 129SV/C57Bl6 background. ES cells and mice were genotyped using a BamHI digest and a 3′ probe (Fig. 1H). The ApcMin strain is commercially available from Jackson Laboratory. The Slc26a4 knock-out mice were provided as cryoconserved embryos by Eric Green (5Everett L.A. Belyantseva I.A. Noben-Trauth K. Cantos R. Chen A. Thakkar S.I. Hoogstraten-Miller S.L. Kachar B. Wu D.K. Green E.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In Situ Hybridization, Immunofluorescence, and Western Blot—For in situ hybridization, 12-μm cryosections were prepared. The templates for probe transcription were 1175 bp of Slc5a8 cDNA (5′ cgtacacatgatgcttcagttttgg, 3′ catgaaacaaaccacatgacgtgtg) and of 994 bp of Slc5a12 cDNA (5′ tgtactttaacttgttgggtctctgg, 3′ gggttgtagcctggaatctgagccaa) amplified by RT-PCR. A polyclonal antiserum was raised against a peptide sequence (VFKKRNHVLNYKLHPVEVGC) close to the SLC5A8 C terminus. The serum was affinity-purified against the peptide sequence. Other primary antibodies were α-MCT 1 (1:300; Chemicon), α-laminin (1:100; DSHB), α-fibronectin (1:100; BD Biosciences); Secondary antibodies (1:2000) were Alexa Fluor 488 goat α-mouse, Alexa Fluor 546 goat α-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 488 goat α-rabbit (Invitrogen), or sheep α-rabbit IgG-HRP (Chemicon, 1:5000). TOTO-3 or DAPI (both 1:1000; Invitrogen) were used for nuclear staining, Phalloidin-TRITC (1:1000, Sigma) for actin labeling. For immunofluorescence, appropriate tissues of Slc5a8-/- mice were used as controls. Protein extracts from tissues were prepared by homogenization in 3 ml of buffer (125 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 4.5 mm EDTA, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche 11836153001). Extracts were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. From the supernatant, proteins were collected at 135,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of sample buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 10% SDS, Complete protease inhibitor mixture). The protein concentration was determined using the DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad 500-0111). 10 μg of protein extracts (0.3 μg for kidney) were separated on 4–12% SDS-PAGE gradient gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). By using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and SuperSignal Femto detection solution (Perbio Science), signals were detected with a VersaDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Metabolic Cages—Single mice were kept in mouse metabolic cages (Techniplast) with free access to water and chow. After adaptation to the cage, urine and feces were collected over 24-h periods. The analysis of urinary electrolytes was performed by Vet Med Lab (Ludwigsburg, Germany). Measurement of Lactate in Blood and Saliva—Blood for analysis of lactate concentration was collected from the tail tip. For saliva collection, animals were fasted for 5 h before the experiment. To activate salivation, mice were injected with 5 mg of pilocarpine per kg of bodyweight. After 2 and 4 min, saliva was collected from the mouth of the animals. The lactate concentration was determined by Lactate Scout (SensLab, Germany). Histology—Tissue samples (large intestine, kidney, submandibular gland, and thyroid) were perfused and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined for histological changes by light microscopy. Carcinogen Treatment—Treatments were performed with 5-month-old mice. A single lot of azoxymethane (AOM) was used (Sigma-Aldrich, 100-mg isovials). Each 100-mg vial was resuspended in 3.9 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and aliquots were stored at -20 °C. A 1 μg/μl working solution was prepared in 0.9% NaCl. Mice were treated intraperitoneally with 10 mg of AOM per kg of body weight once a week for 8 weeks (21Bissahoyo A. Pearsall R.S. Hanlon K.

Second, 2% sodium dextran sulfate (MW: 36,000–50,000, MP Biomedicals, Inc.) was added to the drinking water for 1 week, followed by a 2-week-period with drinking water. This treatment was repeated three times (23Okayasu I. Hatakeyama S. Yamada M. Ohkusa T. Inagaki Y. Nakaya R. Gastroenterology. 1990; 98: 694-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three months after the end of the respective treatment, tumor development was scored by endoscopic examination as previously described (24Becker C. Fantini M.C. Neurath M.F. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2900-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In brief, all visible tumors were counted and graded by the following criteria: grade 1-very small but detectable; grades 2–5: tumor covering up to one-eighth [2], up to one-fourth [3] up to one-half [4], more than one-half [5] of the colonic circumference. RNA Expression Analysis—Total RNA from colon was isolated with the TRIzol (Invitrogen) method. RNA concentrations were measured using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). RNA quality was confirmed using RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer). RNA integrity numbers for the 10 samples ranged from 8.9 to 9.6. For Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 hybridization, 10 μg of total RNA were used for sample preparations as suggested by the Affymetrix Eukaryotic Target Protocol. Affymetrix Quality Control Reporter tool was used to assure the uniform performance of the individual GeneChip hybridizations with present calls between 52 and 56% for all GeneChips and comparable 3′/5′ ratios for the internal controls. Data were analyzed using Stratagene Arrayassist 5.5.1. For background correction, normalization, and probe summarization we used the RMA algorithm (25Irizarry R.A. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y.D. Antonellis K.J. Scherf U. Speed T.P. Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8483) Google Scholar). To suppress noise at very low signal intensities, variance stabilization was performed. Data were log-transformed to base 2 and baseline transformed with the WT group as baseline. An asymptotic t test was performed. To account for multiple hypothesis testing, Benjamini-Hochberg (26Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. J. R. Statist. Soc. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar) and alternatively Westfall-Young (27Westfall P.H. Young S.S. Resampling-based Multiple Testing: Examples and Methods for p-Value Adjustment. John Wiley and Sons, New York1993Google Scholar) correction were performed. For real-time RT-PCR we used an iCycler iQ™ (Bio-Rad) using the Absolute QPCR SYBR Green Fluorescein mix (Abgene). Values were normalized to an endogenous reference: SQtarget/SQHPRT. Analysis of Thyroid Function—The T4 concentration was measured by using a commercial RIA (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc., Beckmann Coulter). As an internal control, we used serum from mice fed with iodide-depleted nutrition (Altromin) containing 0.15% propylthiouracil (PTU, Sigma) for 10 days. TSH measurement was performed by Dr. Parlow (National Hormone & Peptide Program; Harbor-UCLA). The efficiency of iodide incorporation into thyroglobulin was measured as described (28van den Hove M.F. Croizet-Berger K. Jouret F. Guggino S.E. Guggino W.B. Devuyst O. Courtoy P.J. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, we injected 15 μCi of 125I- (Amersham Biosciences) intraperitoneally. After 1 h, animals were anesthetized; thereafter blood was taken from the heart with a syringe and the thyroid was excised. To block unspecific binding of 125I to hemoglobin, iodide to a final concentration of 6 mm was added to the blood sample (29Harmatz P.R. Walsh M.K. Walker W.A. Hanson D.G. Bloch K.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 102: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Unbound 125I- was removed from serum by Zebra™ Desalt Spin Columns (Pierce). The ratio protein-bound 125I/free serum 125I- over time is a measure of thyroid function. A second readout for 125I- organification was the ratio protein-bound 125I in serum/125I- taken up into the thyroid over a 1-h period. To evaluate the method, a time course series of the iodide incorporation was performed. A 1-h period was chosen between 125I- injection and blood sampling. Ussing Chamber Analysis—A 3-cm long proxomedial part of the colon was removed, and the colonic lumen was rinsed with ice-cold Parsons solution. This standard buffer for the Ussing chamber experiments contained (mm): 107 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO3, 1,8 Na2HPO4, 0.2 NaH2PO4, 1.25 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, and 12 glucose. The solution was gassed with carbogen; pH was 7.4. The addition of lactate did not change this pH. For the Na+-free solution, NaCl was replaced by N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG+) chloride. The tissue was fixed in a modified Ussing chamber, bathed with a volume of 3.5 ml on each side of the mucosa, and short-circuited by a computer-controlled voltage-clamp device (Muβler Ingenieurbüro, Aachen, FRG) with a correction for solution resistance. The exposed surface of the tissue was 1 cm2. Short-circuit current (Isc) was continuously recorded, and tissue conductance (Gt) was measured every min by applying a current pulse of ± 50 μA·cm-2. Isc is expressed as μEq·h-1·cm-2, i.e. the flux of a monovalent ion per time and area, with 1 μEq·h-1·cm-2 = 26.9 μA·cm-2. For statistical analysis, we calculated the ratio between the maximal decrease of the Isc within 5 min after lactate addition and the mean Isc 3 min before lactate addition. To determine the unidirectional mucosa-to-serosa flux (Jms) of butyrate, sodium [14C]butyrate (37 kBq, Hartmann Analytical, Braunschweig, Germany) was added to the mucosal side after an equilibration period of 30 min. For these experiments, the mucosal buffer contained 5 mm sodium butyrate and the serosal buffer contained 8 mm mannitol for osmotic compensation. After an additional 30 min to allow isotope fluxes to reach a steady state, unidirectional ion fluxes were determined over two sequential 20-min periods. Both periods were averaged to calculate the flux rate. All aliquots from the labeled side were replaced by unlabeled buffer solution, and an appropriate correction for this replacement solution was performed. The radioactivity in the samples was determined in a liquid scintillation counter (TRIS-CARB® 2700 TR Liquid scintillation analyser, Packard, Frankfurt, Germany). The unidirectional mucosa-to-serosa flux (Jms) is indicated as transported amount of butyrate per surface area and time [μmol·cm-2·h-1]. Statistics—An unpaired Student's t test assuming equal variances or a Mann-Whitney test was used to compare data from two treatment groups. Homozygous Mutant SLC5A8 Mice Are Viable and Fertile and Lack Major Morphological Malformations—The Slc5a8 locus was modified in ES cells by targeted recombination resulting in the integration of a neomycin-resistance cassette flanked by loxP sites upstream of the fourth exon and an additional loxP site downstream of the fifth exon (Fig. 1A). Mice homozygous for the integrated targeting vector did not show any obvious phenotype. To delete the selection cassette and generate a null allele of Slc5a8, mutant mice were bred to Meu-Cre40 mice resulting in the deletion of a 2.7-kb fragment encompassing the fourth and fifth exon (Fig. 1A). Heterozygous progeny, which were Cre-recombinase negative were backcrossed to C57BL6 mice and mated to each other to generate homozygous mutant animals. Homozygous animals were viable and fertile and did not show any obvious phenotype regarding weight, morphology, or motility. SLC5A8 Is Expressed in Apical Membranes of Different Epithelial Cells—RNA in situ hybridizations were performed on different organs and sagittal sections of mice 1 day after birth with a specific probe for Slc5a8. We observed a strong expression of Slc5a8 in the submandibular gland, kidney, and gut at P1 (Fig. 1, B–D). In the adult kidney, we detected Slc5a8 mRNA in the kidney cortex, with more intense signals in the inner cortex (Fig. 1E). The related Na+-monocarboxylate transporter Slc5a12 was mainly detected in the outer cortex of the kidney (Fig. 1F) as previously described (13Srinivas S.R. Gopal E. Zhuang L. Itagaki S. Martin P.M. Fei Y.J. Ganapathy V. Prasad P.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). SLC5A8 expression was also investigated by Western blot analysis of multiple organs with an affinity-purified antiserum against a peptide close to the C terminus of the protein. Specific signals were detected in kidney, salivary gland, and large intestine (Fig. 1I). We did not detect the protein in brain and heart (Fig. 1I), liver, lung, spleen, muscle, testis, and uterus (data not shown). Immunofluorescence staining using the affinity-purified antiserum revealed a strong expression in the kidney, intestine, thyroid, and salivary gland, but not in the brain. The domains of protein expression corresponded well with expression of the mRNA detected by in situ hybridization. The expression of SLC5A8 in the kidney was confined to the cortex and the outer stripe of the outer medulla (Fig. 2A). The presence of SLC5A8 was restricted to the brush border of proximal tubules as indicated by costaining with phalloidin-TRITC, which identifies the brush border of the proximal tubules. Almost all proximal tubules of the outer stripe of the outer medulla were labeled, whereas many proximal tubules of the outer kidney cortex are devoid of SLC5A8 protein. Similar observations were also made by Gopal et al. (10Gopal E. Fei Y.J. Sugawara M. Miyauchi S. Zhuang L. Martin P. Smith S.B. Prasad P.D. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44522-44532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) who described the expression of SLC5A8 in the S3 segment of the proximal tubule. The expression of SLC5A8 in the thyroid gland was limited to the apical membrane of follicular cells (Fig. 2B). In the parotid gland, we detected expression of SLC5A8 at the apical membranes of intercalated duct cells (Fig. 2C) and of the acini (not shown). In the submandibular gland, immunoreactivity was only found in the apical membrane of the serous acini while the mucosal acini of this mixed salivary gland were negative for SLC5A8 (Fig. 2D). In the digestive tract, a double staining of monocarboxylic acid transporter 1 (MCT1, SLC16A1) and SLC5A8 was carried out. SLC5A8 was present in the apical membrane of both the surface epithelium and in crypts, whereas MCT1 labeling was exclusively observed in the basolateral membrane of surface epithelium and crypts. The intensity of SLC5A8 staining increased from the small intestine to the colon (Fig. 2, E–I). The jejunum presented a very faint but specific apical signal (not shown), whereas no immunoreactivity for SLC5A8 was detected in the duodenum and stomach (not shown). The anti-MCT1 (SLC16A1) antibody intensely labeled the large intestine (Fig. 2, F–J) but not the small intestine (Fig. 2E). The specificity of signals was always confirmed by parallel processing of the respective Slc5a8-/- tissues (Fig. 3K).FIGURE 3Histological sections of the thyroid of Slc5a8-/-/Slc26a4-/- mice.

Histological investigation of the thyroid of up to 2-year-old Slc5a8-/- animals did not reveal any changes in the size of the thyroid or any other obvious morphological abnormalities. The histological examination was repeated in 5-month-old animals from Slc5a8/Slc26a4 cross-breedings. As expected, we did not observe any changes in morphology of Slc5a8-/- or Slc26a4-/- thyroids (Fig. 3, A–C); neither did we observe any apparent pathological changes in the thyroidea of Slc5a8/Slc26a4 compound mutant mice (Fig. 3D). We also analyzed the concentration of T4 in all different genotypes; no significant differences of T4 concentrations were detected (WT/WT: 2.27 ± 0.33 μg/dl (n = 6); Slc26a4+/+/Slc5a8-/-: 2.56 ± 0.37 (n = 8); Slc26a4-/-/Slc5a8+/+: 2.06 ± 0.27 (n = 8); KO/KO: 2.8 ± 0.33 (n = 8)). The concentration of TSH in blood was determined for WT (160 ± 7.0) and Slc5a8-/- (166 ± 7.2 ng/ml serum; n = 25/23) and was not significantly different. For WT versus Slc5a8-/- we also measured the 125I- incorporation into the serum protein as a measure for thyroid iodide organification as the percentage bound 125I/unbound 125I- in serum after 1 h of incorporation.

https://openalex.org/W1964046999,"The mass and chemical composition of a star are the primary determinants of its basic physical properties-radius, temperature and luminosity-and how those properties evolve with time. Accordingly, two stars born at the same time, from the same natal material and with the same mass, are 'identical twins,' and as such might be expected to possess identical physical attributes. We have discovered in the Orion nebula a pair of stellar twins in a newborn binary star system. Each star in the binary has a mass of 0.41 +/- 0.01 solar masses, identical to within 2 per cent. Here we report that these twin stars have surface temperatures differing by approximately 300 K ( approximately 10 per cent) and luminosities differing by approximately 50 per cent, both at high confidence level. Preliminary results indicate that the stars' radii also differ, by 5-10 per cent. These surprising dissimilarities suggest that one of the twins may have been delayed by several hundred thousand years in its formation relative to its sibling. Such a delay could only have been detected in a very young, definitively equal-mass binary system. Our findings reveal cosmic limits on the age synchronization of young binary stars, often used as tests for the age calibrations of star-formation models."
https://openalex.org/W2061926839,"Secretory vesicles of sympathetic neurons and chromaffin granules maintain a pH gradient toward the cytosol (pH 5.5 versus 7.2) promoted by the V-ATPase activity. This gradient of pH is also responsible for the accumulation of amines and Ca2+ because their transporters use H+ as the counter ion. We have recently shown that alkalinization of secretory vesicles slowed down exocytosis, whereas acidification caused the opposite effect. In this paper, we measure the alkalinization of vesicular pH, caused by the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1, by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in cells overexpressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein-labeled synaptobrevin (VAMP2-EGFP) protein. The disruption of the vesicular gradient of pH caused the leak of Ca2+, measured with fura-2. Fluorimetric measurements, using the dye Oregon green BAPTA-2, showed that bafilomycin directly released Ca2+ from freshly isolated vesicles. The Ca2+ released from vesicles to the cytosol dramatically increased the granule motion of chromaffin- or PC12-derived granules and triggered exocytosis (measured by amperometry). We conclude that the gradient of pH of secretory vesicles might be involved in the homeostatic regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ and in two of the major functions of secretory cells, vesicle motion and exocytosis.

Secretory granules from chromaffin cells are large dense core vesicles similar to vesicles present in many other neuroendocrine cells and in sympathetic neurons (1Winkler H. J. Anat. 1993; 183: 237-252PubMed Google Scholar). Chromaffin granules are extremely efficient concentrating solutes, so that catecholamines reach 500–1000 mm (2Jankowski J.A. Schroeder T.J. Ciolkowski E.L. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14694-14700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Albillos A. Dernick G. Horstmann H. Almers W. Alvarez de Toledo G. Lindau M. Nature. 1997; 389: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) and ATP reaches 125–300 mm (4Winkler H. Westhead E. Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 1803-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The mechanisms used to obtain these large concentrations of solutes have intrigued researchers for three decades. Intravesicular aggregation has been proposed as the mechanism for reducing osmotic forces resulting from the large amount of solutes concentrated in vesicles. Chromaffin granules maintain a pH gradient across their membranes of ∼2 orders of magnitude, ∼5.5 inside and ∼7.3 in the cytosol. This gradient is held stable by the activity of a specific H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). Vesicular H+ are used as antiporters to accumulate catecholamines by the vesicular monoamine transporter VMAT-2 (5Johannes L. Lledo P.M. Roa M. Vincent J.D. Henry J.P. Darchen F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) or Ca2+ (6Haigh J.R. Phillips J.H. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The presence of a vesicular matrix composed of solutes and chromogranins has been proposed as the chelating method to reduce the osmotic forces (7Helle K.B. Reed R.K. Pihl K.E. Serck-Hanssen G. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1985; 123: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) to allow the accumulation of catecholamines at high concentrations. Most of the intravesicular solutes are not free but associated to the matrix, where the main proteic components are chromogranins, whose pKa is ∼5.5 (7Helle K.B. Reed R.K. Pihl K.E. Serck-Hanssen G. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1985; 123: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Videen J.S. Mezger M.S. Chang Y.M. O’Connor D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3066-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, intravesicular pH can regulate the ability of chromogranin A to form aggregates (9Taupenot L. Harper K.L. O’Connor D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3885-3897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is plausible that the regulation of vesicular pH could play an important role in the accumulation of Ca2+ and catechols (10Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7740-7745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mahapatra N.R. Mahata M. Hazra P.P. McDonough P.M. O’Connor D.T. Mahata S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51107-51121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the vesicular pH is closely associated with the modulation of the kinetics and quantal characteristics of the exocytosis of catecholamines (12Camacho M. Machado J.D. Montesinos M.S. Criado M. Borges R. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the importance of vesicular Ca2+ is frequently ignored. ∼30% of the total chromaffin cell volume is occupied by ∼20,000 granules (13Plattner H. Artalejo A.R. Neher E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1709-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The estimated free Ca2+ concentration in the granules has been reported to be 40–80 μm in PC12 (14Moreno A. Lobaton C.D. Santodomingo J. Vay L. Hernandez-San-Miguel E. Rizzuto R. Montero M. Alvarez J. Cell Calcium. 2005; 37: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and 50–100 μm in chromaffin cells (15Bulenda D. Gratzl M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7760-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 3J. Alvarez, unpublished data. 3J. Alvarez, unpublished data. Moreover, the granules accumulate 20–40 mm of total Ca2+, more than 99% in bounded form (11Mahapatra N.R. Mahata M. Hazra P.P. McDonough P.M. O’Connor D.T. Mahata S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51107-51121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which is in striking contrast to the ∼100 nm Ca2+ concentration found in the cytosol, thus creating a Ca2+ concentration gradient of up to 105-fold across the granule membrane. Therefore, the chromaffin granules contain far more Ca2+ than any other organelle, accounting for ∼60% of the total calcium in the chromaffin cell (16Haigh J.R. Parris R. Phillips J.H. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, despite the fact that the Ca2+ released from secretory vesicles is probably the closest to its sensors for triggering motion and/or exocytosis, its real participation on cell physiology is still under debate. However, it is not easy to design an experimental approach in bovine chromaffin cells to demonstrate the role of intravesicular Ca2+ in these functions under physiological stimuli, such as acetylcholine, because they also promote massive Ca2+ entry and intracellular mobilization of Ca2+ from other sources.

Biol. 1997; 200: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a powerful tool for studying the role of pH in vesicular Ca2+ turnover because it directly alkalinizes chromaffin granules with few effects on other structures, at least in the nanomolar range (19Gagliardi S.

We have found that bafilomycin A1-mediated alkalinization causes the release of Ca2+ from granules to cytosol, and this effect is able to increase the lateral motion of chromaffin granules and to trigger exocytosis, even in Ca2+-free medium. Therefore, intravesicular Ca2+ may represent a novel source of Ca2+ capable of creating a local microdomain able to control both granule motion and exocytosis.

Sinaptobrevin 2, fused on the C terminus (lumenal) to EGFP (VAMP2-EGFP) was the kind gift from Dr. R. W. Holz (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) (21Allersma M.W. Wang L. Axelrod D. Holz R.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4658-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—Bovine chromaffin cells were isolated by adrenal medulla digestion with collagenase IA and further Urografin® centrifugation, as described (22Machado J.D. Segura F. Brioso M.A. Borges R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20274-20279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cells were suspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 50 IU ml–1 penicillin, and 50 μg ml–1 gentamicin and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For amperometry experiments, 5 × 104 cells were plated on 12-mm diameter glass coverslips. The cells were used at room temperature between 1 and 5 days of culture. To transfect bovine chromaffin cells, the Ca2+ phosphate precipitation method was used, as described (23Wilson S.P. Liu F. Wilson R.E. Housley P.R. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured on 6-well culture plates at 1.2 × 106 cells/cm2 and transfected with 0.5–1 μg ml–1 plasmid DNA (VAMP2-EGFP). After transfection, for TIRFM experiments, the cells were removed from these dishes using a rubber policeman and replated on 25-mm Ø coverslips coated with calfskin collagen to promote cell adhesion. The experiments were performed 4–8 days after the preparation of cultures. PC12 cells were maintained in 75-ml flasks at 37 °C/5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum. For transfection, PC12 cells were grown up to 60% of confluence for 2 days, then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and detached with trypsin-versene. The cells were then replated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (n = 1.518; Warner Instruments, Hamdem, CT), placed in 6-well plates and transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA (NPY-EGFP) using Lipofectamine™ 2000 in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Amperometry—Carbon fiber microelectrodes of 5-μm radius (Thornel P-55; Amoco Corp., Greenville SC) were prepared as described (24Kawagoe K.T. Zimmerman J.B. Wightman R.M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1993; 48: 225-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Electrodes were calibrated in a flow cell and accepted for cell studies when the application of noradrenaline (50 μm) resulted in an oxidation current of 300–400 pA, which is reduced by 80–100 pA under stop flow conditions. Amperometric measurements were performed with the carbon fiber microelectrode gently touching the cell membrane using an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) (22Machado J.D. Segura F. Brioso M.A. Borges R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20274-20279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Signals were low pass filtered at 1 kHz and collected at 4 kHz using locally written software (LabView for Macintosh, National Instruments, Austin, TX). Data analysis was conducted using locally written macros for IGOR (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) (25Segura F. Brioso M.A. Gomez J.F. Machado J.D. Borges R. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 103: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cytosolic Ca2+ Measurement—Chromaffin cells plated onto 12-mm coverslips were loaded in standard Krebs-HEPES buffer containing 2 μm fura-2 AM for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed for 45 min at room temperature and placed in a cell chamber mounted on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope under continuous perfusion. Single cell fluorescence was excited at 340 and 380 nm (100 ms of excitation at each wavelength every 2 s, 10-nm bandwidth) using a monochromator (Cairn Res. Faversham, UK). Images of the emitted fluorescence, obtained with a 40× Fluar objective, were collected using a 400DCLP dichroic mirror and a D510/80 emission filter (Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT) and then recorded by a ORCA-ER camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). Single cell fluorescence records were ratioed and calibrated into [Ca2+]c values off-line, by using the Metafluor program (Universal Imaging Corporation, PA), as described (26Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed at 37 °C using an on-line heater. Evanescent Field Microscopy—TIRFM images were obtained by directing an argon ion laser (488 line; Melles Griot (Carlsbad, CA) model 35-LAP-431-208 or 3W Lexel (Fremont, CA) model 95) through a custom side port to a side facing dichroic mirror Q495LPw/AR, and a HQ500 LP emission filter (Chroma Technology) on an Olympus IX70 microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY). The beam was focused on the periphery of the back focal plane of a 100 × 1.65 N.A. oil-immersion objective (Olympus); thus the laser beam was incident on the coverslip at 58.4–64.2° from the normal. Digital images were captured by a cooled CCD camera (SensiCam; Cooke, Romulus, MI) and acquired at 2 Hz. Cell perfusion was performed by using a computer-controlled perfusion apparatus (model DAD-6VM; ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY). Image Analysis—Fluorescence intensity profiles, from the whole cell stacks, were plotted versus time. Local background, defined as the average fluorescence outside the region of interest, was subtracted in each frame. For individual granules, a circle of 0.9-μm diameter was drawn around the center, and the average fluorescence intensity therein was calculated. The local background was the average fluorescence outside the region. To avoid misinterpretation caused by z axis motion, changes in vesicular pH were conducted only on still labeled granules that did not collide with neighboring granules. These were tracked through time sequence stacks, as described (21Allersma M.W. Wang L. Axelrod D. Holz R.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4658-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Steyer J.A. Almers W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2262-2271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A data set was generated containing the x-y coordinates of the granule positions from the stacks of images. The trajectory in the plane of the membrane was plotted for each granule. We used the distance of the median (x, y) of the data set to the furthest point to define the radius of a circle that would encompass every data point to calculate the maximum range of a given trajectory. The analysis of all the images was performed using MetaMorph (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Purification of Bovine Chromaffin Granules—Chromaffin granules were obtained from homogenates of bovine adrenal medulla by differential centrifugation, as previously described (28Smith A.D. Winkler H. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 480-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The chromaffin granules were separated from mitochondria on a discontinuous isosmotic density gradient of iodixanol (OptiPrep™) in water 60% (w/v) (29Buchanan C.M. Phillips A.R. Cooper G.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The gradient consisted of two solutions of 8 and 16% (w/v) of OptiPrep in a solution of 0.3 m sucrose, containing 6 mm EDTA, 6 mm MgSO4, and 60 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. The ultracentrifugation was conducted at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a Beckman model L8–70 ultracentrifuge, with a type 50Ti fixed angle rotor. After centrifugation, the chromaffin granules were taken from the sediment, and resuspended in the intracellular solution containing 20 mm HEPES, 155 mm potassium glutamate, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.01 mm ascorbic acid, 2 mm ATP-Mg, 2 mm ATP-Na, pH 7 (KOH). Calcium Release from Isolated Granules—Chromaffin granules were kept on ice before starting the experiments. Fluorescent of Oregon green BAPTA-2 on the solutions was monitored in a 3-ml polystyrene cuvette at 523-nm emission with 494-nm excitation wavelength, using a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA). The temperature was kept at 37 °C, and a magnetic stirrer ensured continuous mixing. An aliquot of 50 μl of chromaffin granules at the concentration of 3 mg protein ml–1, determined by the modified Folin-Lowry procedure (30Hartree E.F. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (4527) Google Scholar), was added to the cuvette containing intracellular solution buffer and 1 μm of the nonpermeant dye Oregon green BAPTA-2. Different drugs were applied by micropipette in the Ca2+-free solution chromaffin granules suspension. The maximum of Oregon green BAPTA-2 fluorescence intensity was determined by adding 1% Triton X-100, and the minimum of fluorescence was determined by the addition of 5 mm EGTA. Bafilomycin Transiently Alkalinizes Secretory Granules—Chromaffin cells expressing the protein VAMP2-EGFP were used to test the direct effect of the H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 on the pH of single granules. This protein is then sorted into secretory granules (21Allersma M.W. Wang L. Axelrod D. Holz R.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4658-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) exhibiting a pH-dependent fluorescence emission. Fig. 1A shows TIRFM images from cells exhibiting fluorescence spots close to the plasma membrane, which were identified as single large dense-core granules. This approach was successfully used to monitor the intravesicular changes of pH. The application of Baf (100 nm) for 30 s in the vicinity of a cell produced a 2-fold increase in the cell fluorescence, indicating an alkalinization process (Fig. 1B, upper trace). This transient increase of the fluorescent emission was observed for ∼50 s and then falling to the basal level. The averaged result for four cells is illustrated in the bottom trace of Fig. 1B. We selected single granules as described under “Experimental Procedures” to analyze this phenomenon more extensively. Fig. 1C shows a series of time frames of a typical chromaffin granule expressing VAMP2-EGFP and the transient alkalinization caused by Baf. Thus, the transient fluorescence increase induced by Baf was also observed in individual granules. Fig. 1D shows the intensity profile of fluorescence from a single granule versus time (left panel), and the averaged fluorescence (background subtracted) obtained from 19 granules (four cells, right panel), which remained still for at least 120 s. Bafilomycin Increases the Granule Motion—An unexpected observation from TIRFM experiments was that bafilomycin increased the lateral motion of chromaffin granules (see supplemental Movie S1 and Fig. 2A). In the presence of bafilomycin 80% of the vesicles were more mobile, and 36% increased their motility 2-fold. To explore the relation between the alkalinization and granule motion, we analyzed the mobility in the lateral plane (parallel to the membrane) of single secretory granules. We used TIRFM stacks of chromaffin granules to track the position of single labeled chromaffin granules before, during and after the application of Baf. We only analyzed granules that did not collide with the neighboring granules, during the recording period. The mobility of each granule was analyzed by determining its x-y coordinate positions and then calculating the radius of the circle containing the trajectories. The plots from Fig. 2A show examples of four representative tracks of chromaffin granules before, during, and after the application of Baf. Fig. 2B shows a 43% increase in granule motion, observed on the addition of Baf in chromaffin cells. However, we could not conclude that changes in the fluorescence of given granules were associated with an increase in their motion because mobile granules also increased their z displacement that exponentially affected the light they emitted. PC12 cells contain fewer granules than chromaffin cells. For this reason, it is fitting to follow their trajectories in the x-y plane. We transiently expressed the NPY-EGFP protein in PC12 cells that sorted into secretory granules, as previously described (20Taraska J.W. Perrais D. Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nagamatsu S. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2070-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). TIRFM stacks were recorded at 2 Hz for 5 min in PC12 cells preincubated with or without Baf (100 nm). Fig. 2C shows examples of granule trajectories (supplemental Movie S2), and the averaged data are shown in Fig. 2D. Bafilomycin A1 Releases Ca2+ from Intracellular Stores—Chromaffin cells loaded with fura-2 were used to test whether the alkalinization of secretory vesicles by Baf (50 nm) caused the release of Ca2+. Fig. 3A shows a typical control cell (from 14 cells) that had a stable base line for 40 min before receiving 30 s stimulation with K+ (70 mm). Fig. 3B shows a typical recording of a cell (from 35) after the application of Baf for 5 min. Although the increase of cytosolic free [Ca2+]c was observed in all the cells, the pattern of Ca2+ elevations varied from cell to cell and was oscillatory, as in Fig. 3B, or exhibited a stable plateau (not shown). In all the cases, the effects of Baf were reversible. The magnitude of the change was much lower than that evoked by K+, but the total amount of the Baf-induced released Ca2+, throughout the stimulus (the integral of the effect of Baf), could be enough to cause biological effects. We observed a delayed onset of 95 ± 11 s between drug application and Ca2+ signals. Alkalinization of Chromaffin Granules Causes the Release of Ca2+—The experiments shown in Fig. 4 were conducted using fluorescence time lapse to address the question of whether Baf, by reducing the pH gradient across granule membrane, may trigger the release of intravesicular Ca2+. Chromaffin-isolated granules were maintained in suspension in the cuvette of a spectrofluorometer at 37 °C, in a Ca2+-free buffer containing 4 mm ATP (see “Experimental Procedures”). We used the nonpermeant dye Oregon Green® 488 BAPTA-2 to measure free Ca2+. Basal fluorescence of the Ca2+ probe was monitored for 30 s. Subsequently, to assess the release of Ca2+, a first round of drugs was added to the final concentration indicated in the legend of the Fig. 4. Then chromaffin granule membranes were ruptured by adding Triton X-100 (final concentration, 1%) to release all the intravesicular Ca2+. No further effects were observed, if any of the drugs were added after Triton. Finally, to standardize the responses, 1 mm Ca2+ and 5 mm EGTA (final concentration) were successively added. This protocol resulted in a signal as illustrated in Fig. 4A, and the typical effects of the drugs are presented in Fig. 4 (B–G). These results indicate that Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (25 μm) caused the leak of Ca2+ from the secretory vesicles. The release was monitored as a slow increase in the fluorescence that fits a sigmoid profile (Fig. 4C). Conversely, nigericin (2 μm), a H+/K+ exchanger ionophore that disrupts the pH gradient, caused the fastest and biggest Ca2+ displacement, out of granules (Fig. 4D). Then we observed that 100 nm Baf, in the same concentration used in intact chromaffin cells, promoted the release of Ca2+ from chromaffin granules (Fig. 4E) and Baf (300 nm) released Ca2+ to a similar extent as A23187 did (Fig. 4G), thus indicating the crucial role of the pH in the maintenance of the vesicular calcium. Then we observed that 100–300 nm Baf promoted the release of Ca2+ from chromaffin granules (Fig. 4, E–G). The Baf effects were concentration- and time-dependent, although a concentration of 300 nm was required to observe rapid and substantial effects (Fig. 4, E–G). However, valinomycin at 1 μm, an ionophore that does not modify the gradient of pH, did not significantly release Ca2+ from isolated vesicles (Fig. 4A). Bafilomycin Triggers Exocytosis—To test whether the efflux of calcium from secretory vesicles has functional implications on the exocytosis, we performed amperometry experiments. Although TIRFM allows the monitoring of exocytotic events, they were seldom observed (see supplemental Fig. S1). Nevertheless, amperometry with carbon fiber microelectrodes recorded, at the level of single exocytotic events, the effects of bafilomycin on the release of catecholamines from bovine chromaffin cells. A brief application of the Krebs-HEPES buffer did not elicited secretion, thus ruling out the possibility that secretion could be triggered by mechanical stimulation (Fig. 5A). However, a 30-s application of Baf (100 nm) triggered exocytosis both in the presence (Fig. 5B) and in the absence of external Ca2+ (5 mm EGTA; Fig. 5C). Although the frequency of exocytotic events, recorded along 4 min, was smaller in the absence of external Ca2+ (0.118 versus 0.350 Hz), their quantal characteristics were similar (data not shown). The idea that intravesicular Ca2+ could be involved in the exocytotic process was first postulated by Borowitz in 1967 (31Borowitz J.L. J. Cell Physiol. 1967; 69: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the physiological role of cell organelles in the homeostasis of Ca2+ is still currently under debate. Endoplasmic reticulum was considered as the main source of Ca2+, and the mobilization of Ca2+ stores by IP3 was first discovered in this organelle. However, the involvement of other organelles like mitochondria, nucleus, and Golgi in the uptake, release, and cytosolic redistribution of Ca2+ have also been recently proven (32Garcia A.G. Garcia-De-Diego A.M. Gandia L. Borges R. Garcia-Sancho J. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1093-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Even considering that secretory vesicles contain large amounts of Ca2+ (15Bulenda D. Gratzl M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7760-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and that this cation is crucial for processes that take place “just across their membrane,” like vesicle movement or exocytosis, they have received little attention in terms of Ca2+ homeostasis. The main argument has been that vesicular Ca2+ is sequestered into the vesicular matrix and has little turnover. Intravesicular Ca2+ kinetics seems to follow a bi-compartmental model where the total amount of chelated Ca2+ is estimated to be ∼40 mm (15Bulenda D. Gratzl M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7760-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas free Ca2+ is ∼3 orders of magnitude lower. This probably accounts for the rapid recovery of free Ca2+ after its depletion of the free compartment with caffeine or pH-disrupting agents like carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (14Moreno A. Lobaton C.D. Santodomingo J. Vay L. Hernandez-San-Miguel E. Rizzuto R. Montero M. Alvarez J. Cell Calcium. 2005; 37: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The recent development of targeted aequorins inside secretory vesicles has directly confirmed that the free Ca2+ fraction inside these organelles is ∼20–40 μm (15Bulenda D. Gratzl M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7760-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and can be mobilized by caffeine, ATP, or depolarizing stimuli (14Moreno A. Lobaton C.D. Santodomingo J. Vay L. Hernandez-San-Miguel E. Rizzuto R. Montero M. Alvarez J. Cell Calcium. 2005; 37: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Bulenda D. Gratzl M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7760-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Secretory vesicles accumulate Ca2+ and catecholamines by specific antiporters that use H+ as a counter ion. Several protonophores (33Haynes C.L. Buhler L.A. Wightman R.M. Biophys. Chem. 2006; 123: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or weak bases (12Camacho M. Machado J.D. Montesinos M.S. Criado M. Borges R. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34Mundorf M.L. Hochstetler S.E. Wightman R.M. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9136-9142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) induce both the alkalinization of granules and the release of Ca2+ toward the cytosol. We have demonstrated that some drugs like hydralazine, which are accumulated in chromaffin granules, displace catecholamines and Ca2+ toward the cytosol (36Machado J.D. Gomez J.F. Betancor G. Camacho M. Brioso M.A. Borges R. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently shown that the reduction of the pH gradient across the granule membrane produces a reduction in the catecholamine content of chromaffin granules (12Camacho M. Machado J.D. Montesinos M.S. Criado M. Borges R. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This paper has been aimed to test whether the modifications in the vesicular pH could promote the release of Ca2+ and to check whether the elevation of Ca2+ in the vicinity of granules also plays a role in the vesicle motion and exocytosis. Bafilomycin is a highly selective blocker (in the nanomolar range) of the V-ATPase, which maintains the pH value near 5.5 in the inner vesicle (37Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Indeed, it is a powerful tool to directly study the effects of vesicle alkalinization in a reversible way. Although other cell organelles like lysosomes, endocytic vesicles, and early endosomes acidify their lumen by means of the V-ATPase, the cell volume occupied by chromaffin granules is large enough (∼30%) to account for the main part of the observed effects of bafilomycin. In this paper we have demonstrated that transient alkalinization of granule lumen (Fig. 1) releases Ca2+ from granules (Fig. 4) toward the cytosol (Fig. 3) that drastically increases the movement of granules (Fig. 2) and promotes exocytosis (Fig. 5). There is increasing evidence about the ability of vesicles to trigger their own exocytosis by releasing their internal Ca2+ (35Mundorf M.L. Troyer K.P. Hochstetler S.E. Near J.A. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9136-9142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, the tight relation observed between the raise of vesicular pH and the release of Ca2+ (33Haynes C.L. Buhler L.A. Wightman R.M. Biophys. Chem. 2006; 123: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and catecholamines (12Camacho M. Machado J.D. Montesinos M.S. Criado M. Borges R. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) suggests that bafilomycin A1 causes a significant vesicular dissociation of Ca2+ from the matrix. Hence, the resultant elevated [Ca2+]c triggers exocytosis. Therefore, these data provide strong evidence that intravesicular Ca2+ may represent a novel source of Ca2+ able to create a specific microdomain of Ca2+ in the exact location to control both granule motion and exocytosis. Most of the vesicular Ca2+ seems to be closely associated with other soluble components (ATP, ascorbate, catecholamines, and chromogranins) inside the vesicle to form the matrix and to reduce the osmotic forces caused by these large amounts of osmotically active substances. However, the free fraction of Ca2+ reaches 40 μm (14Moreno A. Lobaton C.D. Santodomingo J. Vay L. Hernandez-San-Miguel E. Rizzuto R. Montero M. Alvarez J. Cell Calcium. 2005; 37: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which is in equilibrium with the Ca2+ bound (∼40 mm) (15Bulenda D. Gratzl M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7760-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), allowing a rapid recovery after an acute depletion like that caused by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (14Moreno A. Lobaton C.D. Santodomingo J. Vay L. Hernandez-San-Miguel E. Rizzuto R. Montero M. Alvarez J. Cell Calcium. 2005; 37: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or the alkalinization mediated by the activation of several second messenger routes (12Camacho M. Machado J.D. Montesinos M.S. Criado M. Borges R. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The main problem to demonstrate whether the intravesicular Ca2+ is actively participating in granule motion and exocytosis, under physiological conditions, is the difficulty in differentiating this Ca2+ from the Ca2+ arriving from other sources. All known secretagogues increase free cellular Ca2+ by activating its entry from external media and/or promoting its release from internal stores. We have shown here that vesicular alkalinization induces Ca2+ release from the granules. Given that many second messenger routes activated by neurotransmitters and drugs have been reported to modify the vesicular pH, it seems plausible that the pH gradient across the vesicular membrane could be a necessary link between physiological stimuli and the regulation of Ca2+ release from the secretory vesicles. Although bafilomycin is not a physiological stimulus, the results presented in this paper reveal a novel mechanism for the release of Ca2+ from secretory vesicles, which is controlled by vesicular pH. Cell stimulation by different mechanisms, mediated by either inositol triphosphate receptors, ryanodine receptors, or plasma membrane Ca2+ channels, has been reported to induce transient vesicular Ca2+ release (14Moreno A. Lobaton C.D. Santodomingo J. Vay L. Hernandez-San-Miguel E. Rizzuto R. Montero M. Alvarez J. Cell Calcium. 2005; 37: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Other stimuli that activate guanylate cyclase or adenylate cyclase that alkalinize the vesicular lumen might also mimic these mechanisms. The physiological relevance of the Ca2+ release from secretory vesicles will require further investigation. In this paper, we demonstrate that transient changes in the pH gradient, through the vesicular membrane, cause a substantial release of Ca2+. Taking into account the poor diffusion of Ca2+ through the cytosol (38Sala F. Hernandez-Cruz A. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 313-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), we consider it highly plausible that vesicular Ca2+ could be playing a relevant physiological role in the approach of the granule to the membrane (39von Ruden L. Neher E. Science. 1993; 262: 1061-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 40Allersma M.W. Bittner M.A. Axelrod D. Holz R.W. Mol. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2080188769,"The evolved properties of proteins are not limited to structure and stability but also include their propensity to undergo local conformational changes. The latter, dynamic property is related to structural cooperativity and is controlled by the folding-energy landscape. Here we demonstrate that the structural cooperativity of the ribosomal protein S6 is optimized by geometric overlap of two competing folding nuclei: they both include the central β-strand 1. In this way, folding of one nucleus catalyzes the formation of the other, contributing to make the folding transition more concerted overall. The experimental evidence is provided by an extended set of circular permutations of S6 that allows quantitative analysis of pathway plasticity at the level of individual side chains. Because similar overlap between competing nuclei also has been discerned in other proteins, we hypothesize that the coupling of several small nuclei into extended “supernuclei” represents a general principle for propagating folding cooperativity across large structural distances. The evolved properties of proteins are not limited to structure and stability but also include their propensity to undergo local conformational changes. The latter, dynamic property is related to structural cooperativity and is controlled by the folding-energy landscape. Here we demonstrate that the structural cooperativity of the ribosomal protein S6 is optimized by geometric overlap of two competing folding nuclei: they both include the central β-strand 1.

Because similar overlap between competing nuclei also has been discerned in other proteins, we hypothesize that the coupling of several small nuclei into extended “supernuclei” represents a general principle for propagating folding cooperativity across large structural distances. Proteins are highly evolved molecules that are selected and optimized by the functional requirements of the cell. The optimization, however, works not only on the native structures but also involves their physical properties (1Oliveberg M. Wolynes P.G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2005; 38: 245-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). A well known example is protein stability, i.e. the equilibrium between folded states and the denatured counterparts, that needs to be maintained within certain limits to assure functionality and yet allow degradation. Protein sequences are moreover tuned to resist aggregation and erroneous interactions with other biomolecules. In part such tuning is achieved by electrostatic repulsion (2Chiti F. Calamai M. Taddei N. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16419-16426Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 3Sandelin E. Nordlund A. Andersen P.M. Marklund S.S. Oliveberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21230-21236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and negative design, i.e. side chains in the form of gatekeepers that specifically reduce sequence stickiness (4Otzen D.E. Kristensen O. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9907-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) or otherwise obstruct unwanted interactions between or within proteins (4Otzen D.E. Kristensen O. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Brooks III, C.L. Onuchic J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). At a more generic level, protein aggregation seems also to be prevented by the folding potential itself. The factors that govern structural specificity disfavor automatically non-native contacts between molecules and bias the proteins to aggregate by native-like interactions (4Otzen D.E. Kristensen O. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9907-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 9Silow M. Tan Y.J. Fersht A.R. Oliveberg M.

A. 2004; 101: 13786-13791Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The archetypical example of such aggregates is the domain swap (11Guo Z. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8042-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Bennett M.J. Choe S. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3127-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). A seemingly different type of aggregation is the ordered assembly into fibrils driven by sequence signatures that allow linear propagation of non-native β-structure (13Fandrich M. Fletcher M.A. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). In either case, aggregation relies on the exposure of amino acid segments that are normally hidden within the native structure, for example by local unfolding. There is growing evidence that proteins suppress such detrimental unfolding events by increasing the unfolding cooperativity (14Lindberg M. Tangrot J. Oliveberg M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 818-822PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dumoulin M. Canet D. Last A.M. Pardon E. Archer D.B. Muylder-mans S. Wyns L. Matagne A. Robinson C.V. Redfield C. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 773-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Nordlund A. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10218-10223Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that, unlike native structure and stability, cooperativity is a property that is primarily determined by the folding-energy landscape (14Lindberg M. Tangrot J. Oliveberg M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 818-822PubMed Google Scholar). The principle can be illustrated as follows. If the folding-energy landscape allows only one folding route, thermal motions of the native state would repeatedly lead to excursions along the same unfolding trajectory. Such narrow sampling of the conformational space could make the affected parts of the protein loose and susceptible to local unfolding by even modest fluctuations (14Lindberg M. Tangrot J. Oliveberg M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 818-822PubMed Google Scholar). If in contrast the energy landscape is tuned to have a broad, diffuse folding progression there is no preferred way of unfolding the protein: each microscopic unfolding attempt involves different parts of the structure (17Plotkin S.S. Onuchic J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6509-6514Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In effect, this uniform probability of unfolding will produce a native structure that is relatively “rigid” because the simultaneous occupancy of partly unfolded states that are matched for aggregation is minimized. From experimental studies of small two-state proteins it is apparent that most natural proteins belong to the latter category (18Jackson S.E. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: R81-R91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Folding seems optimized for high cooperativity manifested in transition-state structures, i.e. folding nuclei, that resemble diffuse versions of the native structures (14Lindberg M. Tangrot J. Oliveberg M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 818-822PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the idea that the diffuse transition-state structure is a biological adaptation, it can readily be changed by circular permutation into polarized, less cooperative counterparts where half of the protein is fully structured and the other half is disordered (19Lindberg M.O. Haglund E. Hubner I.A. Shakhnovich E.I. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4083-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Lindberg M.O. Oliveberg M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Also the transition-state structure responds readily to extensive changes in the side-chain contacts as observed in comparative studies of sequence-divergent homologs (21Zarrine-Afsar A. Larson S.M. Davidson A.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 23Lappalainen I. Hurley M.G. Clarke J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 547-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Even so, the factors governing folding cooperativity are yet poorly understood, and cooperativity is also the molecular trait of naturally evolved proteins that is most difficult to reproduce in silico and by de novo design. One possibility is that cooperativity is achieved by balancing long sequence separation between interacting residues with strong contacts. Such equalization of the folding probability across the protein structure has been seen to promote diffuse nuclei in both computational (17Plotkin S.S. Onuchic J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6509-6514Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 24Matysiak S. Clementi C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Wu L. Zhang J. Wang J. Li W.F. Wang W. Phys. Rev. E Stat. Nonlin. Soft Matter Phys. 2007; 75: 031914Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and experimental studies (14Lindberg M. Tangrot J. Oliveberg M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 818-822PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently circular permutations of S6 and SH3 show that the contribution of individual side chains to the folding nucleus is directly related to changes in sequence separation of the interacting side chains, implicating that chain entropy is indeed a responsive factor for tuning the folding trajectory. But there is more to it. The plasticity of the S6 folding reaction seems restrained to two competing pathways corresponding to nucleation in either half of the protein structure (19Lindberg M.O. Haglund E. Hubner I.A. Shakhnovich E.I. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4083-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Lindberg M.O. Oliveberg M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is further apparent that the competing nuclei of S6 are to some degree overlapping, providing a clue to how the folding cooperativity can be extended from one part of the structure to another (20Lindberg M.O. Oliveberg M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar): strand 1 (β1) in the center of the β-sheet is part of both nuclei (see Fig. 1). To shed further light on how this putative coupling of cooperativity works, here we specifically investigate the behavior of the nuclei overlap. The study is based on φ-value analysis of a new, expanded set of S6 permutants that includes incisions between all six secondary structure elements. The fate of each part of the S6 structure is thus monitored and compared on six different settings of the folding-energy landscape, yielding statistics that are sufficiently exact to map out folding changes at the level of individual side chains. The results show that the majority of φ-values respond to circular permutation as predicted from changes in sequence separation. A distinct exception, however, are the φ-values in β1 that remain constant around 0.5. The insensitivity of β1 to pathway changes suggests that its side chains form an approximately equal number of interactions with each of the two S6 nuclei. One side of β1 is part the α1 nucleus, whereas the other is part of the α2 nucleus. Thus, when folding shifts between the α1 and α2 nuclei, the β1 contacts simply shift from one side to the other with little effect on the macroscopic φ-values. From a general perspective, this balanced shift of nucleating contacts around β1 provides a concrete example of how structural order can be propagated from one nucleus to the other without the accumulation of partly structured intermediates. On this basis, we conclude that folding cooperativity is a modular property that can be extended through protein structures by multiple, competing, folding nuclei that share structural overlap. Protein Engineering—All circular permutants of S6 are labeled according to the position of the incisions, and their amino acids are numbered according to the wild-type sequence, Protein Data Bank code 1RIS (26Lindahl M. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Sedelnikova S.E. Eliseikina I.A. Fomenkova N.P. Nevskaya N. Nikonov S.V. Garber M.B. Muranova T.A. Rykonova A.I. Amons R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1249-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The wild-type numeration was used for all point mutations in this study. The circular permutants P13-14 and P68-69 were designed and constructed as described previously (27Lindberg M.O. Tangrot J. Otzen D.E. Dolgikh D.A. Finkelstein A.V. Oliveberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the circular permutants P54-55, P33-34, and P81-82 were designed and constructed according to the procedures in Ref. 19Lindberg M.O. Haglund E. Hubner I.A. Shakhnovich E.I. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4083-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar. The genes designed for P33-34 and P81-82 were purchased from Entelechon. By these five constructs, all possible incisions between the secondary structure elements of S6 have been covered. The point mutations used for mapping out the interactions in the transition-state ensembles of the permuted proteins were chosen to cover all parts of the hydrophobic core. Protein Expression and Purification—Mutations were performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), oligonucleotides were purchased from DNA Technology, and all mutations were confirmed by sequencing (eurofins mug operon). The mutant proteins were transformed and overexpressed in competent Escherichia coli strain BL21 or C41 DE3 and then purified by two-step precipitation followed by cation-exchange chromatography (CM-Sepharose) and gel filtration (Sephacryl S-100) as described previously (28Otzen D.E. Kristensen O. Proctor M. Oliveberg M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6499-6511Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The buffer was 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Kinetic Measurements—Stopped-flow measurements and curve fitting were performed on SX-18MV and PiStar instruments (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the emission was collected with a 305-nm-cutoff filter. Mixing was 1 + 10, and the final protein concentration was 0.8 μm. All measurements were conducted at 25 °C in 50 mm MES 3The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; wt, wild type. at pH 6.3 (Sigma) using GdmCl as denaturant (UltraPure, Invitrogen). Chevron Analysis—To minimize the effect of chevron curvatures at low and high GdmCl concentrations, the kinetic m-values were derived from the linear regime at the bottom of the chevron plots, i.e. midpoint ± 2 m, using the standard equation, where kfH2O and kuH2O are the refolding and unfolding rate constants at [GdmCl] = 0 m, and mf and mu are the slopes of the refolding and unfolding chevron limbs, respectively. Data analysis was performed with the software KaleidaGraph 4.0 and GraphPad Prism 4.0. φ-Value Analysis—By systematically truncating side chains while measuring the effects on the folding and unfolding kinetics it is possible to map out the interaction patterns in the transition-state ensemble (30Fersht A.R. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: a Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999Google Scholar). In essence, mutations that slow down the refolding reaction are considered to target stabilizing contacts in its structure. The strengths of these interactions are measured by the φ-values. A φ-value of 0 indicates that the targeted side chain experiences a denatured-like environment in the transition-state ensemble, whereas a φ-value of 1 indicates that it has a fully native-like environment. Fractional values of φ are thus taken to indicate the degree of native-like interactions, i.e. φ = 0.5 indicates that the truncated side-chain moieties form half of the native contacts in the folding transition state. To reduce the effects of extrapolation errors and transition-state shifts occurring at high [GdmCl] (29Oliveberg M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 765-772Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the φ-values (30Fersht A.R. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: a Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999Google Scholar) were calculated from chevron fits (Equation 1) according to Equation 2, where A = 1 m and B = 4 m, referring to the GdmCl concentrations at which the refolding and unfolding rate constants were taken. The change of φ upon circular permutation was then calculated according to Equation 3. Δϕ = ϕwild type − ϕpermutant In the cases where the transition midpoints were too low to allow precise fits of the refolding limb, i.e. midpoints <2 m GdmCl, mf was locked to the average value of the permutant in question. The current procedure for calculating the φ-values is slightly different from that in Refs. 14Lindberg M. Tangrot J. Oliveberg M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 818-822PubMed Google Scholar and 19Lindberg M.O. Haglund E. Hubner I.A. Shakhnovich E.I. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4083-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and in a few cases causes small deviations from previously published data. The magnitude of these differences, however, is within the experimental errors and has no significance for the interpretation of data. Data for mutations with ΔΔG < 0.7 kcal/mol were excluded together with data where the m-value changes produced artificially high values of ΔΔG, i.e. V40A and F60A in S6wt, L19A in P33-34, and F60A in P81-82 (see Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). Notably derivation of φ according to Equation 2 emphasizes mainly the structures of the early transition-state ensembles. Analysis of the later transition states needs to include the downward kinks in the unfolding limb appearing at high [GdmCl] (28Otzen D.E. Kristensen O. Proctor M. Oliveberg M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6499-6511Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 29Oliveberg M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 765-772Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (see data in Fig. 2). Slight shifts to parallel folding pathways upon point mutation were in some cases indicated by anti-Hammond behavior but are currently not possible to account for in an accurate manner. However, the error due to such shifts is likely to be small but could contribute to under-estimating the φ-values in the α1 nucleus (see scheme in Fig. 8).TABLE 1S6wtlogkfH2OlogkuH2O β‡log KH2OΔGD-NΔΔGD-NφφelementWild type2.64−1.26−3.630.570.693.421.836.278.971.38−1.34V6A1.86−1.49−2.000.410.792.041.903.865.343.640.37−0.370.51I8A1.61−1.41aValue set to average mf because MP <2 M.−1.940.570.731.841.923.564.824.170.200.100.450.43β1L10A1.83−1.41aValue set to average mf because MP <2 M.−1.670.510.701.672.013.504.374.620.420.720.32L19A2.42−1.41−2.220.500.742.431.914.646.362.611.01−0.230.25I26A1.86−1.35−2.690.660.672.272.004.555.943.030.51−0.060.400.33α1L30A2.03−1.56−2.710.780.672.032.344.745.313.660.470.410.34V37A2.39−1.42−2.250.510.742.411.934.656.312.660.98−0.220.27V40A2.64−1.37−3.480.580.703.141.956.138.230.741.27−1.17bData excluded because ΔΔGD-N largely due to m-value changes.0.27β2L48A2.65−1.32−2.980.450.753.181.775.638.320.651.33−1.17cData excluded because ΔΔGD-N <0.70.F60A2.54−1.36−2.740.430.762.961.795.287.741.231.19−1.01bData excluded because ΔΔGD-N largely due to m-value changes.L61A2.40−1.53−2.010.550.732.122.084.405.553.420.870.200.25Y63A2.30−1.41aValue set to average mf because MP <2 M.−1.800.570.711.941.984.115.083.910.890.460.210.28β3V65A2.16−1.55−2.430.580.732.152.134.585.643.330.61−0.090.38V72A2.59−1.34−2.790.530.722.881.875.387.561.421.25−0.690.17L75A2.30−1.39−2.670.500.732.631.894.976.892.080.91−0.660.410.25α2L79A2.27−1.41aValue set to average mf because MP <2 M.−0.920.540.721.611.953.194.214.780.861.260.17V85A2.51−1.31−1.250.480.732.101.793.765.513.461.210.680.08V88A2.39−1.21−1.780.380.762.631.594.186.882.091.19−0.260.150.13β4V90A2.42−1.29−1.400.350.792.331.643.826.122.861.140.000.16a Value set to average mf because MP <2 M.b Data excluded because ΔΔGD-N largely due to m-value changes.c Data excluded because ΔΔGD-N <0.70.

https://openalex.org/W2042820065,"Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica is an enterobacterial phytopathogen causing economically significant soft rot disease. Pathogenesis is mediated by multiple secreted virulence factors, many of which are secreted by the type II (Out) secretion system. DsbA catalyzes the introduction of disulfide bonds into periplasmic and secreted proteins. In this study, the extracellular proteome (secretome) of wild type E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica SCRI1043, and dsbA and out mutants, was analyzed by spectral counting mass spectrometry. This revealed that dsbA inactivation had a huge impact on the secretome and identified diverse DsbA- and Out-dependent secreted proteins, representing known, predicted, and novel candidate virulence factors. Further characterization of the dsbA mutant showed that secreted enzyme activities, motility, production of the quorum-sensing signal, and virulence were absent or substantially reduced. The impact of DsbA on secreted virulence factor production was mediated at multiple levels, including impacting on the Out secretion system and the virulence gene regulatory network. Transcriptome analyses revealed that the abundance of a broad, but defined, set of transcripts, including many virulence factors, was altered in the dsbA mutant, identifying a new virulence regulon responsive to extracytoplasmic conditions. In conclusion, DsbA plays a crucial, multifaceted role in the pathogenesis of E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica."

https://openalex.org/W2029086021,"Background Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors play important roles in differentiation processes during embryonic development of vertebrates. In the pancreas, the atonal-related bHLH gene Neurogenin3 (Neurog3) controls endocrine cell fate specification in uncommitted progenitor cells. Therefore, it is likely that Neurog3-regulated factors will have important functions during pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation. The gene for the atonal-related bHLH factor Math6 was recognized as a potential target of Neurog3 in a genomic scale profiling during endocrine differentiation. Herein we have explored the role of Math6 during endocrine pancreas development. Results We demonstrate that the Math6 gene is a direct target of Neurog3 in vitro and that, during mouse development, Math6 is expressed in both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic precursor cells. We have investigated the role of Math6 in endocrine differentiation by over-expressing this factor in pancreatic duct cells. Math6 possesses intrinsic transcriptional repressor activity and, in contrast to Neurog3 it does not induce the endocrine differentiation program; however, it can modulate some of the pro-endocrine functions of Neurog3 in this system. In addition, we show that Math6 is broadly expressed in mouse embryonic tissues and its expression is induced by tissue-specific bHLH genes other than Neurog3. Furthermore, inactivation of the Math6 gene in the mouse results in early embryonic lethality demonstrating an essential role of this factor in organismal development. Conclusions These data demonstrate that Math6 is a novel component of the pancreatic transcriptional network during embryonic development and suggest a potential role for Math6 as a modulator of the differentiation program initiated by the pro-endocrine factor Neurog3. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that Math6 is indispensable for early embryonic development and indicate a more widespread function for this factor in tissue-specific differentiation processes that are dependent on class II bHLH genes."
https://openalex.org/W1986160318,"Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for six months is the mainstay of global child health and the preferred feeding option for HIV-infected mothers for whom replacement feeding is inappropriate. Promotion of community-level EBF requires effective personnel and management to ensure quality counselling and support for women. We present a costing and cost effectiveness analysis of a successful intervention to promote EBF in high HIV prevalence area in South Africa, and implications for scale-up in the province of KwaZulu-Natal.The costing of the intervention as implemented was calculated, in addition to the modelling of the costs and outcomes associated with running the intervention at provincial level under three different scenarios: full intervention (per protocol), simplified version (half the number of visits compared to the full intervention; more clinic compared to home visits) and basic version (one third the number of visits compared to the full intervention; all clinic and no home visits). Implementation of the full scenario costs R95 million ($14 million) per annum; the simplified version R47 million ($7 million) and the basic version R4 million ($2 million). Although the cost of the basic scenario is less than one tenth of the cost of the simplified scenario, modelled effectiveness of the full and simplified versions suggest they would be 10 times more effective compared to the basic intervention. A further analysis modelled the costs per increased month of EBF due to each intervention: R337 ($48), R206 ($29), and R616 ($88) for the full, simplified and basic scenarios respectively. In addition to the average cost effectiveness the incremental cost effectiveness ratios associated with moving from the less effective scenarios to the more effective scenarios were calculated and reported: Nothing-Basic R616 ($88), Basic-Simplified R162 ($23) and Simplified-Full R879 ($126).The simplified scenario, with a combination of clinic and home visits, is the most efficient in terms of cost per increased month of EBF and has the lowest incremental cost effectiveness ratio."
https://openalex.org/W2087560896,"In Gram-positive bacteria, a large subfamily of dual ATP-binding cassette proteins confers acquired or intrinsic resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin antibiotics by a far from well understood mechanism. Here, we report the first biochemical characterization of one such protein, Vga(A), which is involved in streptogramin A (SgA) resistance among staphylococci. Vga(A) is composed of two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), separated by a charged linker, with a C-terminal extension and without identified transmembrane domains. Highly purified Vga(A) displays a strong ATPase activity (Km = 78 μm, Vm = 6.8 min-1) that was hardly inhibited by orthovanadate. Using mutants of the conserved catalytic glutamate residues, the two NBDs of Vga(A) were shown to contribute unequally to the total ATPase activity, the mutation at NBD2 being more detrimental than the other. ATPase activity of both catalytic sites was essential for Vga(A) biological function because each single Glu mutant was unable to confer SgA resistance in the staphylococcal host. Of great interest, Vga(A) ATPase was specifically inhibited in a non-competitive manner by the SgA substrate, pristinamycin IIA (PIIA). A deletion of the last 18 amino acids of Vga(A) slightly affected the ATPase activity without modifying the PIIA inhibition values. In contrast, this deletion reduced 4-fold the levels of SgA resistance. Altogether, our results suggest a role for the C terminus in regulation of the SgA antibiotic resistance mechanism conferred by Vga(A) and demonstrate that this dual ATP-binding cassette protein interacts directly and specifically with PIIA, its cognate substrate.

Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of infection in hospitals and the community with a unique ability to become resistant to antibiotics by a broad range of mechanisms (1Casey A.L. Lambert P.A. Elliott T.S. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2007; 29: S23-S32Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).

Like other MLS antibiotics, streptogramins inhibit protein translation (3Mukhtar T.A. Wright G.D. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). They consist of two components, produced simultaneously by several strains of streptomycetes. The SgA components are cyclic polyunsaturated macrolactones such as pristinamycin IIA (PIIA). The SgB components are cyclic depsipeptides such as pristinamycin IA (PIA). Both components target the ribosomal peptidyl transferase cavity as observed from the crystal structure of the streptogramin-bound 50 S subunit (4Harms J.M. Schlunzen F. Fucini P. Bartels H. Yonath A. BMC Biol. 2004; 2: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The two components are separately bacteriostatic, but they act synergistically when combined, becoming bactericidal. The synergism between SgA and SgB is related to the ability of SgA to enhance the affinity of SgB for the ribosome (5Vannuffel P. Cocito C. Drugs. 1996; 51: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), inducing a conformational rearrangement of the U2585 nucleotide of the 23 S rRNA (4Harms J.M. Schlunzen F. Fucini P. Bartels H. Yonath A. BMC Biol. 2004; 2: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This synergism was exploited for manufacturing mixtures usable in human medicine, such as Pyostacine® or Synercid® (6Barriere J.C. Berthaud N. Beyer D. Dutka-Malen S. Paris J.M. Desnottes J.F. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1998; 4: 155-180PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gurk-Turner C. Proc. (Bayl. Univ. Med. Cent.). 2000; 13: 83-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ng J. Gosbell I.B. J. Antimicrob.

A high level of resistance to the synergic mixtures is observed in Gram-positive bacteria when both SgA and SgB resistance determinants are combined (9Leclercq R. Courvalin P. Lancet. 1998; 352: 591-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Resistance to SgB is due to erm (MLSgB resistance phenotype) (10Jin H.J. Yang Y.D. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 25: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) or vgb (SgB resistance phenotype) (11Korczynska M. Mukhtar T.A. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10388-10393Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) genes. Resistance to SgA is achieved by ribosome modification as described for Cfr (12Long K.S. Poehlsgaard J. Kehrenberg C. Schwarz S. Vester B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 2500-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), or by drug acetylation as described for Vat(D) (13Kehoe L.E. Snidwongse J. Courvalin P. Rafferty J.B. Murray I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29963-29970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), or by a putative efflux mechanism, as recently suggested for the ABC protein Vga(A) (14Chesneau O. Ligeret H. Hosan-Aghaie N. Morvan A. Dassa E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ABC proteins constitute one of the most abundant family of proteins in living organisms. They are mainly involved in transport processes, but very few of them have been characterized as antibiotic exporters (15Bouige P. Laurent D. Piloyan L. Dassa E. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2002; 3: 541-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 16Lubelski J. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Typical ABC transporters consist of two transmembrane domains (TMDs), which determine substrate specificity, and two highly conserved nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), which couple ATP hydrolysis to substrate transport. The four domains may be expressed as separated polypeptides or fused in a variety of configurations (17Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Among ABC antibiotic exporters, substrate specificity can be wide, as illustrated by LmrA or VcaM that can extrude a plethora of antibiotics (18Huda N. Lee E.W. Chen J. Morita Y. Kuroda T. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2413-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Poelarends G.J. Mazurkiewicz P. Putman M. Cool R.H. Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Drug. Resist. Updat. 2000; 3: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). On the contrary, substrate specificity can be restricted to a subclass of antibiotics, exemplified by MacB that confers resistance only to 14- and 15-membered ring macrolides (20Kobayashi N. Nishino K. Yamaguchi A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5639-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 21Tikhonova E.B. Devroy V.K. Lau S.Y. Zgurskaya H.I. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 895-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Vga(A) belongs to the antibiotic resistance (ARE) subfamily of ABC proteins. ARE proteins comprise two NBDs fused into the same polypeptide chain with no identified TMD partner to constitute a canonical transporter (15Bouige P. Laurent D. Piloyan L. Dassa E. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2002; 3: 541-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Ross J.I. Eady E.A. Cove J.H. Baumberg S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 183: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Many ARE subfamily proteins were found in MLS antibiotic-producing actinomycetes (23Mendez C. Salas J.A. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The most studied ARE proteins are Ole(B), from the oleandomycin producer Streptomyces antibioticus (24Buche A. Mendez C. Salas J.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and two proteins of distinct specificities: Msr(A) and Vga(A), both of which are coded by mobile genetic elements in staphylococci. Msr(A) confers a high level resistance to 14- and 15-membered ring macrolides and to SgB components (25Ross J.I. Eady E.A. Cove J.H. Cunliffe W.J. Baumberg S. Wootton J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1207-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), whereas Vga(A) confers a low level resistance to lincosamides and a high level resistance to SgA components (14Chesneau O. Ligeret H. Hosan-Aghaie N. Morvan A. Dassa E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this work, we report the first biochemical characterization of an ARE protein. We have produced full-length Vga(A) in Escherichia coli and purified it as a soluble protein under native conditions. We have characterized its ATPase activity and investigated the effect of different antibiotics targeting the 50 S ribosomal subunit on this activity. We demonstrate the specific interaction between Vga(A), a dual ABC protein devoid of TMDs, and PIIA, its cognate MLS substrate. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Antibiotics—Plasmid pIP1845 (14Chesneau O. Ligeret H. Hosan-Aghaie N. Morvan A. Dassa E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), a derivative of the pRB474 shuttle vector carrying the wild-type vga(A) gene, allowing expression of this gene in both E. coli and staphylococci, was used as a DNA template in PCR experiments. E. coli strain TOP10 and plasmid pCR4 (Invitrogen) were both used for cloning the blunt-ended PCR products. Screening for plasmid DNA mutagenesis was achieved by using E. coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene). E. coli strain AG100A, susceptible to SgA by disruption of the AcrAB pump (26Okusu H. Ma D. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), and Staphylococcus epidermidis strain BM3302 (27El Solh N. Allignet J. Bismuth R. Buret B. Fouace J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1986; 30: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were used as recipients for testing the functionality of the genes cloned into pIP1840, as described previously (14Chesneau O. Ligeret H. Hosan-Aghaie N. Morvan A. Dassa E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Overexpression and purification of the recombinant proteins were carried out using BL21(λDE3) pDIA17 (28Rogé J. Betton J.M. Microb. Cell Fact. 2005; 4: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) transformed with vga(A) constructs cloned into the pIVEX2.3 vector (Roche Applied Science). Antibiotics (ampicillin, lincomycin, and chloramphenicol) were purchased from Sigma or were gifts from Aventis (pristinamycin IA and IIA) and Abbott (erythromycin). Antibiotics were dissolved in water, except for the pristinamycin compounds and chloramphenicol, which were dissolved in methanol and ethanol, respectively. PIIA was qualitatively controlled before and after the enzymatic tests by mass spectrometry. Antibiotic Susceptibility—The minimal inhibitory concentrations of SgA were determined using Mueller-Hinton agar plates (Bio-Rad) in the presence or absence of orthovanadate (Sigma) with a 2-fold increase in antibiotic concentration from 0.125 μg.ml-1 to 128 μg.ml-1. Overnight cultures of E. coli AG100A or S. epidermidis BM3302 harboring pIP1840 and its derivatives contained 100 μg.ml-1 ampicillin or 10 μg.ml-1 chloramphenicol, added to Luria-Bertani or brain-heart infusion media, respectively. 10 μl of a 1000-fold dilution of these cultures was spotted onto Mueller-Hinton agar plates. Incubation was done for 24 h at 37 °C. Plasmid Constructions—Full-length and 3′-truncated versions of the vga(A) gene were obtained by PCR from plasmid pIP1845 using NcoI sense primers VGA5 and VGA8, in combination with antisense primers VGA3-SmaI, and VGA2-EcoRV, respectively (Table 1). Amplification was done in both cases with Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR products were cloned into pCR4 with Zero Blunt TOPO kit (Invitrogen). Inserts of expected sizes were completely sequenced to check the correctness of the genes: the longest one encoded a full-length version of the wild-type Vga(A) protein modified only by the insertion at +2 of an alanine (called thereafter Vga(A)), whereas the shortest one contained an insertion at +2 of a glycine coupled with a deletion at the C terminus of the last 18 amino acids (called thereafter Vga(A)ΔCter). Subcloning of the recombinant vga(A) genes into pIVEX2.3 vector cut with NcoI and SmaI enzymes yielded the pIVEX-derived expression plasmids: pIP1884 carried the NcoI-SmaI fragment that codes for Vga(A), whereas pIP1834 carried the NcoI-EcoRV fragment that codes for Vga(A)ΔCter. Both recombinant Vga(A) proteins contain a C-terminal 6× histidine tag provided by the vector. Functional in vivo testing of the recombinant proteins, i.e. the capacity to confer bacterial resistance against SgA, was achieved by cloning the full-length and the truncated his-tagged versions of Vga(A) into the E. coli-S. aureus expression plasmid pIP1840 as previously described (14Chesneau O. Ligeret H. Hosan-Aghaie N. Morvan A. Dassa E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Two single mutations downstream of the Walker B motifs, E105Q and E410Q (Fig. 1), were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using oligodeoxyribonucleotides listed in Table 1 and the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) as recommended by the manufacturer.

Production of the Vga(A) recombinant proteins was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Promega, Madison, WI) for 16 h at 16–18 °C (final cell density of 3–4 units at 600 nm). Then, cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 15 min) at 4 °C, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until use. Mutated proteins were expressed and overproduced in the same culture conditions as the wild type. Protein overexpression was controlled by 10% SDS-PAGE analysis of total cell extracts. Protein Purification—The same protocol was followed for all recombinant Vga(A) proteins. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The cell pellet from a 2-liter culture was resuspended in 40 ml of buffer A (50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm imidazole, and 0.5% Triton X-100) with 1 mm Pefabloc-SC (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by sonication (5 s on/5 s off, 36 cycles) in a Vibro-cell sonicator (Fisher Bioblock Scientific, Illkirch Cedex, France). The cell lysate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature under mild shaking with 1500 units of benzonase (Sigma). Four milligrams of protamine sulfate (Sigma) were then added, and the cell lysate was incubated for further 30 min under the same conditions. The cell extract was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h, and imidazole was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 25 mm. The extract was applied onto a 1-ml HisTrap nickel-affinity column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) connected to an AKTA-Explorer system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) at a flow rate of 1 ml·min-1. The resin was washed with buffer B (50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 400 mm NaCl) and 50 mm imidazole until the baseline (A280) was reached. Proteins were eluted from the column with a 50–250 mm imidazole gradient in buffer B. Vga(A)-containing fractions were controlled by SDS-PAGE analysis, pooled, and concentrated to a final volume of 10 ml. This pool was loaded onto a 50-ml HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated with buffer C (50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with 20 mm NaCl, at a flow rate of 3 ml·min-1. Vga(A)-containing fractions were applied onto a 1-ml Resource S cationic exchanger resin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and eluted with a linear gradient of 20–500 mm NaCl in buffer C. Vga(A) fractions were collected and concentrated on Amicon Ultra 10K membranes (Millipore) to a final volume of 400 μl. The last purification step was performed on a Superdex 200 HR10/30 column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated with buffer D (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The Vga(A) protein was finally stored at -80 °C at 30–100 μm. Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out using a 10:25 acrylamide/bisacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. Molecular mass standards for SDS-PAGE and for gel filtration chromatography were purchased from GE Healthcare Life Sciences. Immune detection of Vga(A) proteins was carried out as previously described (14Chesneau O. Ligeret H. Hosan-Aghaie N. Morvan A. Dassa E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ATPase Activity—The ATPase activity of Vga(A) proteins was determined at 30 °C by following the amount of radiolabeled inorganic phosphate released during [γ-33P]ATP hydrolysis. The [33P]Pi produced was isolated from [γ-33P]ATP (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) using the charcoal method (29Crane R.K. Lipmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 201: 235-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained, unless otherwise indicated, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2–1 μm of purified Vga(A). The reaction was started by adding [γ-33P]ATP (200 μm, 4 Bq.pmol-1) and stopped at the indicated time at 4 °C by withdrawing 10-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture and adding them to 400 μl of a 4% activated charcoal suspension in 20 mm H3PO4. After centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min), 200 μl of supernatant was mixed with 3 ml of OptiPhase HiSafe3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and counted in a Wallac 1414 liquid-scintillation counter. When antibiotics were used, the amount of methanol never exceeded 2% of the final reaction mix and was kept constant for all the experimental conditions that were tested. To probe inhibition by PIIA, kinetic assays were performed as previously described with 1 μm purified Vga(A), ATP concentrations ranging from 50 to 800 μm, and PIIA from 100 to 800 μm. To test reversibility of PIIA inhibition, 10 μm Vga(A) was preincubated for at least 10 min at 30 °C in the reaction buffers with or without 1 mm PIIA, and then diluted 10 times in the same buffers with or without 1 mm PIIA. When buffers without PIIA were used for the sample dilution, the final PIIA concentration dropped down to 0.1 mm.[γ-33P]ATP was added to start the reaction kinetics. Freshly boiled orthovanadate solutions were prepared as described (30Payen L.F. Gao M. Westlake C.J. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38537-38547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Expression and Antibiotic Resistance Properties of Vga(A) in Staphylococci and in E. coli—To analyze the biochemical properties of Vga(A) and to simplify its purification, a tag consisting of 11 residues, including 6 histidines, was added to the carboxyl end of the full-length protein (Fig. 1). The histidine tag did not modify the minimal inhibitory concentration values of PIIA in S. epidermidis (Table 2), demonstrating that it does not alter the biological function of Vga(A). By contrast, Vga(A) was unable to confer SgA resistance in E. coli AG100A, a strain rendered susceptible to SgA compounds by disruption of the AcrAB pump. On Western blots probed with a specific antiserum, a band of ∼66 kDa, corresponding to Vga(A), was present in the soluble extracts of E. coli cells (not shown). This band was not detected in membrane fractions, contrary to what occurred within the original hosts, S. aureus or S. epidermidis (14Chesneau O. Ligeret H. Hosan-Aghaie N. Morvan A. Dassa E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This result suggests that the absence of resistance of E. coli toward SgA is not due to defective expression of the protein in the heterologous host. Obviously at least one protein partner targeting Vga(A) to the membranes and/or other factor that contribute to the functionality of Vga(A) in staphylococci is not present in E. coli.TABLE 2Values of minimal inhibitory concentration of PIIAPlasmidMinimal inhibitory concentration of PIIA againstE. coli AG100AS. epidermidis BM3302μg.ml–1pIP1840161pIP1845 = pIP1840[vga(A)]1632pIP1872 = pIP1840[vga(A)-His]1632pIP1841 = pIP1840[vga(A)ΔCter-His]168pIP1890 = pIP1840[vga(A)E105Q-His]161pIP1891 = pIP1840[vga(A)E410Q-His]161 Open table in a new tab Purification of Vga(A) and Its Mutated Derivatives—Because the tag did not affect Vga(A) functionality in the native host, we expressed and purified recombinant Vga(A) from E. coli. Using pIVEX vector, Vga(A) was significantly overproduced at 16–20 °C and extracted mainly in a soluble form. Elution of Vga(A) from an immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography column yielded several peaks containing the protein with high amounts of nucleic acids that prevented binding to the subsequent cationic exchanger column. Removal of contaminating nucleic acids, by using benzonase and protamine sulfate precipitation, highly increased the efficiency of the second purification step (Resource S). The third and final purification step, performed on a size-exclusion chromatography column (Superdex 200), allowed us to obtain Vga(A) purified to homogeneity (supplemental Fig. S1A). The purification yields ranged from one to two mg.liter-1 culture. The three mutated derivatives, Vga(A)ΔCter, Vga(A)-E105Q, and Vga(A)-E410Q (Fig. 1), were overproduced and purified following the same protocol. However, we were unable to obtain significant soluble amounts of the Vga(A)-E105Q-E410Q double mutant. All Vga(A) recombinant proteins behave as monomers with the expected molecular weight (supplemental Fig. S1B), and no dimer formation could be evidenced by gel filtration experiments, even in the presence of Mg2+ and/or ATP in all buffers (not shown). All proteins were stored at -80 °C for months, without loss of catalytic activity, which remained homogeneous among various preparations. Intrinsic ATPase Activities of Vga(A) and Its Mutants—The ATPase activity of Vga(A) was linear during the time of kinetics (Fig. 2A). The high catalytic activity of Vga(A) allowed us to work with final protein concentrations that ranged from 0.1 to 1 μm. Similarly to all other ABC proteins, the catalytic activity of Vga(A) was strictly dependent on the presence of Mg2+ ions. Because the initial velocity of hydrolysis decreased only by ∼50% at 500 mm NaCl, we concluded that Vga(A) is not salt-sensitive at physiological concentrations. This stands in sharp contrast to HlyB ATPase domains, whose ATPase activity drops to <25% in the presence of 100 mm NaCl (31Benabdelhak H. Schmitt L. Horn C. Jumel K. Blight M.A. Holland I.B. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Vga(A) exhibited a weak sensitivity to orthovanadate, because 50% inhibition of the catalytic activity was achieved with 2 mm of this compound and 90% inhibition with 10 mm (not shown). At the latter concentration, there is no effect of this compound on the minimal inhibitory concentration values of SgA in S. epidermidis, indicating that both ATPase activity and biological function of Vga(A) are quite resistant to orthovanadate. The two NBDs of Vga(A) have distinct sizes, the N-terminal one (NBD1) being smaller than the C-terminal (NBD2), with a large deletion between the Q-loop and the signature motif (Fig. 1). To evaluate the contribution of each NBD to the ATPase activity of Vga(A), the catalytic glutamate residues downstream of the Walker B motifs were mutated, and the ATPase activities of the mutants were measured. Compared with Vga(A), the catalytic activities of Vga(A)-E105Q and Vga(A)-E410Q represent 70 and 25% of the total ATPase activity, respectively, when measured in the standard reaction mixture (200 μm ATP) (Fig. 2B). The summed ATPase activities of the two mutants nearly account for the entire activity of the wild type. We conclude that ATP hydrolysis can take place at one site independently of the hydrolytic capability of the other site of the Vga(A) NBD1·NBD2 pseudo-heterodimer, as already described for the HlyB-NBD homodimer (32Zaitseva J. Jenewein S. Wiedenmann A. Benabdelhak H. Holland I.B. Schmitt L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9680-9690Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Both NBDs contribute to the total catalytic activity of Vga(A), but their contributions appear to be asymmetric. It is worth mentioning that none of the two glutamate mutants conferred SgA resistance in S. epidermidis (Table 2), whereas both were membrane-associated and expressed as efficiently as the wild type. Therefore, two fully functional catalytic sites are essential for the biological activity of Vga(A). The kinetics of ATP hydrolysis activity of Vga(A) follow the Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig. 3). Vm and Km values were determined for Vga(A) (6.8 min-1 and 78 μm) and compared with those of Vga(A)-E105Q and Vga(A)-E410Q (Table 3). Vm value of Vga(A)-E410Q is strongly reduced, indicating the prevalent role of the NBD2 catalytic site in total ATPase activity of the protein. At the opposite, a mutant affected in the first catalytic site displayed a Vm value similar to that of Vga(A), despite a lower apparent affinity for ATP. These results confirm that, at least for the NBD2 catalytic site, fully functional ATPase at one site is not strictly dependent on the turnover at the other site. The catalytic activity of Vga(A) was also measured with various protein concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 5 μm. In these conditions, the ATPase activity of Vga(A) was st"

High levels of enzyme phosphorylation are obtained by utilization of [gamma-32P]ATP in the absence of Cu+. This phosphoenzyme decays at a much slower rate than observed with Cu.E1 approximately P. In fact, the phosphoenzyme is reduced to much lower steady state levels upon addition of Cu+, due to rapid hydrolytic cleavage. Negligible ATPase turnover is sustained by CopA following deletion of its N-metal binding domain (DeltaNMBD) or mutation of NMBD cysteines (CXXC). Nevertheless, high levels of phosphoenzyme are obtained by utilization of [gamma-3)P]ATP by the DeltaNMBD and CXXC mutants, with no effect of Cu+ either on its formation or hydrolytic cleavage. Phosphoenzyme formation (E2P) can also be obtained by utilization of Pi, and this reaction is inhibited by Cu+ (E2 to E1 transition) even in the DeltaNMBD mutant, evidently due to Cu+ binding at a (transport) site other than the NMBD. E2P undergoes hydrolytic cleavage faster in DeltaNMBD and slower in CXXC mutant. We propose that Cu+ binding to the NMBD is required to produce an ""active"" conformation of CopA, whereby additional Cu+ bound to an alternate (transmembrane transport) site initiates faster cycles including formation of Cu.E1 approximately P, followed by the E1 approximately P to E2-P conformational transition and hydrolytic cleavage of phosphate. An H479Q mutation (analogous to one found in Wilson disease) renders CopA unable to utilize ATP, whereas phosphorylation by Pi is retained."

Multispacer sequence typing (MST) genotyping is based on the sequencing of several intergenic regions selected after complete genome sequence analysis. It has been applied to various pathogens, but not to M. tuberculosis. Methods and Findings In M. tuberculosis, the MST approach yielded eight variable intergenic spacers which included four previously described variable number tandem repeat loci, one single nucleotide polymorphism locus and three newly evaluated spacers. Spacer sequence stability was evaluated by serial subculture. The eight spacers were sequenced in a collection of 101 M. tuberculosis strains from five phylogeographical lineages, and yielded 29 genetic events including 13 tandem repeat number variations (44.82%), 11 single nucleotide mutations (37.93%) and 5 deletions (17.24%). These 29 genetic events yielded 32 spacer alleles or spacer-types (ST) with an index of discrimination of 0.95. The distribution of M. tuberculosis isolates into ST profiles correlated with their assignment into phylogeographical lineages. Blind comparison of a further 93 M. tuberculosis strains by MST and restriction fragment length polymorphism-IS6110 fingerprinting and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units typing, yielded an index of discrimination of 0.961 and 0.992, respectively. MST yielded 41 different profiles delineating 16 related groups and proved to be more discriminatory than IS6110-based typing for isolates containing <8 IS6110 copies (P<0.0003). MST was successfully applied to 7/10 clinical specimens exhibiting a Cts ≤ 42 cycles in internal transcribed spacer-real time PCR. Conclusions These results support MST as an alternative, sequencing-based method for genotyping low IS6110 copy-number M. tuberculosis strains. The M. tuberculosis MST database is freely available (http://ifr48.timone.univ-mrs.fr/MST_MTuberculosis/mst)."
https://openalex.org/W1983949292,"Recent findings have implicated gp130 receptor ligands, particularly ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), as potential anti-obesity therapeutics. Neuropoietin (NP) is a recently discovered cytokine in the gp130 family that shares functional and structural features with CNTF and signals via the CNTF receptor tripartite complex comprised of CNTFRalpha, LIF receptor, and gp130. NP plays a role in the development of the nervous system, but the effects of NP on adipocytes have not been previously examined. Because CNTF exerts anti-obesogenic effects in adipocytes and NP shares the same receptor complex, we investigated the effects of NP on adipocyte development and insulin action. Using cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we observed that NP has the ability to block adipogenesis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We also observed that cultured adipocytes, as well as murine adipose tissue, are highly responsive to acute NP treatment. Rodents injected with NP had a substantial increase in STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and ERK 1 and 2 activation. We also observed the induction of SOCS-3 mRNA in 3T3-L1 adipocytes following NP treatment. Unlike CNTF, our studies have revealed that NP also substantially attenuates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, NP blocks insulin action in adipose tissue in vivo. These observations are supported by data demonstrating that NP impairs insulin signaling via decreased activation of both IRS-1 and Akt. In summary, we have observed that both adipocytes in vitro and in vivo are highly responsive to NP, and this cytokine has the ability to affect insulin signaling in fat cells. These novel observations suggest that NP, unlike CNTF, may not be a viable obesity therapeutic."

Hydrolytic deamination of cytosine to uracil, which is a common type of mutagenic base lesion, leads to the formation of U:G base pairs in DNA (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4273) Google Scholar). The uracil base is also generated by the misincorporation of dUMP during DNA replication, which results in the formation of U:A base pairs.

Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) initiates the BER pathway by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the N-glycosyl bonds linking the uracil base to the sugar-phosphate backbone in DNA. The repair of the abasic site thus produced is achieved by other enzymes, including AP endonuclease, which produces an incision or nick in duplex DNA immediately 5′ to the AP site. Currently, the UDGs are classified into five families, based on their substrate specificity and amino acid sequence motifs in the active site (referred to as motifs A and B), although the UDGs form a single protein superfamily with a common structural fold (reviewed in Refs. 4Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Biol. 2000; 2000: 0007.1-0007.8Google Scholar and 5Pearl L.H. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The family 1 UDGs, including the Ung proteins from Escherichia coli, herpes simplex virus type 1, and humans, have been most extensively studied. The Ung enzymes remove the uracil base from both single- and double-stranded DNA. In human cells, two types of enzymes are produced by alternative splicing and are distributed to mitochondria (UNG1) and the nucleus (UNG2). The family 2 enzymes can catalyze the removal of uracil and thymine that is mispaired with guanine in double-stranded DNA. Mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase and thymine-DNA glycosylase belong to this family. The family 3 UDGs exhibit unique substrate specificity for single-stranded DNA and therefore have been named single strand-selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase. This enzyme family actually has broader specificity than the Ungs, and double-stranded DNA is a substrate as well as single-stranded DNA. The family 4 UDGs are known as the thermostable UDGs found in some thermophilic bacteria and Archaea. Biochemical studies of Pyrobaculum aerophilum UDG and the crystallographic analysis of Thermus thermophilus UDG (TthUDG) revealed that the most characteristic feature of the family 4 UDGs is the presence of structural iron-sulfur (Fe-S) centers (6Sartori A.A.

Recently, several reports have demonstrated the existence of Fe-S-containing enzymes that are involved in DNA transactions (8Rudolf J. Makrantoni V. Ingledew W.J. Stark M.J. White M.F. Mol.

Biol. 2007; 14: 875-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The family 5 UDGs were identified as a novel type of thermostable UDG based on the second UDG activity (UDGb) in P. aerophilum (10Sartori A.A. Fitz-Gibbon S. Yang H. Miller J.H. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3182-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and T. thermophilus (11Starkuviene V. Fritz H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2097-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the family 4 and family 5 UDGs share sequence similarity, their active site forms are different. The active site of the family 5 UDGs lacks a polar residue corresponding to a catalytic residue, glutamate, in the family 4 UDGs. In addition, the family 5 UDG from P. aerophilum can reportedly excise hypoxanthine (deaminated adenine) in DNA (10Sartori A.A. Fitz-Gibbon S. Yang H. Miller J.H. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3182-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Several biochemical studies using human cell extracts have provided evidence for the existence of a UNG2-associated repair complex at replication foci (12Otterlei M.

Locatelli G. Maga G. Dogliotti E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 1569-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The complex contains a DNA sliding clamp called proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which acts as a processivity factor for replicative DNA polymerases (reviewed in Ref. 15Moldovan G.L. Pfander B. Jentsch S. Cell. 2007; 129: 665-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, physical and functional interactions between human UNG2 and PCNA in vitro were confirmed with the purified proteins (16Ko R. Bennett S.E.

It is widely known that many other replicative and repair enzymes interact with PCNA, via a consensus sequence called the PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) box (15Moldovan G.L. Pfander B. Jentsch S. Cell. 2007; 129: 665-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). The PIP box consists of the sequence QXX(L/I/M)XX(F/Y)(F/Y). In many cases, the hydrophobicity of the aromatic side chain of the PCNA is important for the interaction with PCNA-binding proteins (20Haracska L. Johnson R.E. Unk I. Phillips B. Hurwitz J.

Biol. 2000; 10: 919-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It was previously suggested that human UNG2 interacts with PCNA via a typical PCNA-binding motif, 4QKTLYSFF11, at the N terminus of the protein (12Otterlei M. Warbrick E. Nagelhus T.A. Haug T. Slupphaug G. Akbari M. Aas P.A. Steinsbekk K. Bakke O. Krokan H.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3834-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar).In Archaea, the third domain of life, physical interactions between PCNA and the family 4 UDGs from P. aerophilum and Sulfolobus solfataricus have been reported (23Yang H. Chiang J.H. Fitz-Gibbon S. Lebel M. Sartori A.A. Jiricny J. Slupska M.M. Miller J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22271-22278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Dionne I. Bell S.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These previous studies revealed that the two successive hydrophobic amino acid residues within the C-terminal PCNA-binding motif are important for the binding to their cognate PCNA (193PITLDNFL200 for S. solfataricus UDG and 185GGG-LDRFL192 for P. aerophilum UDG). Although the direct interactions between PCNA and the UDGs from the two crenarchaeal organisms described above were well documented, the functional meaning of the interaction is not fully understood. In addition, it is interesting that the unusual PCNA-binding motifs found in these crenarchaeal UDGs are not conserved in Archaea, and especially, several euryarchaeal UDGs lack the C-terminal region containing the PCNA-binding motif of the crenarchaeal UDGs (23Yang H. Chiang J.H. Fitz-Gibbon S. Lebel M. Sartori A.A. Jiricny J. Slupska M.M. Miller J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22271-22278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear whether all of the archaeal UDGs can form complexes with PCNA. Moreover, there has been no report describing the purification of a BER complex from archaeal cell extracts. Thus, little is currently known about the interactions of archaeal UDGs with other related protein factors. Interestingly, the complex formation between archaeal family B DNA polymerase and UDG was described previously (25Connolly B.A. Fogg M.J. Shuttleworth G. Wilson B.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 699-702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The family B DNA polymerases from the hyperthermophilic Archaea specifically recognize a uracil base in the template strand and stall DNA polymerization in vitro. This property of the archaeal DNA polymerases has been implicated as an intrinsic ability for the removal of the uracil base (25Connolly B.A. Fogg M.J. Shuttleworth G. Wilson B.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 699-702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Greagg M.A. Fogg M.J. Panayotou G. Evans S.J. Connolly B.A. Pearl L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The rate of cytosine deamination to uracil is accelerated at high temperature (28Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3405-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). These findings raised the possibility that a unique mechanism for uracil excision repair may exist in hyperthermophilic Archaea.In this study, we describe the physical and functional interactions between the PCNA and UDG proteins from the hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon, Pyrococcus furiosus. The physical interaction between P. furiosus UDG (PfuUDG) and P. furiosus PCNA (PfuPCNA) was detected by a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. The stimulatory effect of PfuPCNA on the uracil-N-glycosylase activity of PfuUDG in vitro was also observed. Based on our knowledge, the PCNA-interacting site was predicted in the PfuUDG sequence, and the pentapeptide sequence 152AKTLF156 in PfuUDG was demonstrated to be directly involved in binding to PfuPCNA. Interestingly, the PCNA-binding motif found in PfuUDG was not located at the extreme C terminus, as in the crenarchaeal UDGs, but toward the middle of the peptide chain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning the Genes Encoding PfuUDG and Its Mutant Proteins—The uracil DNA glycosylase gene (udg) was amplified by PCR directly from P. furiosus genomic DNA, using the oligonucleotides 5′-GCGCCATATGTCAAAGCATGAGCTAATGAA-3′ and 5′-GCGCGGATCCCTAAATCCCTAGTTTTTCTA-3′ as the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The amplified gene was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), and its nucleotide sequence was confirmed. The cloned gene was digested by NdeI-BamHI and inserted into the corresponding sites of the expression vector, pET-21a (Novagen). The resultant plasmid was designated pET-udg. Amino acid substitutions were introduced into the udg gene on the pET-udg plasmid by a PCR-mediated mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene) using the appropriate primers. Their sequences are available upon request.Protein Purification—To obtain recombinant PfuUDG, E. coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) carrying pET-udg were grown in 1 liter of LB medium, containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, at 37 °C. The cells were cultured to A600 = 0.60, and expression of the udg gene was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm and continuing the culture for 3 h at 37 °C. After cultivation, the cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol). The soluble cell extract, obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, was heated at 80 °C for 20 min. The heat-resistant fraction obtained by centrifugation was treated with 0.15% polyethyleneimine to remove the nucleic acids. The soluble proteins were precipitated by 80% saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was resuspended in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) and was subjected to chromatography on a Hitrap phenyl column (GE Healthcare). The proteins containing the UDG activity were eluted at 0 m ammonium sulfate, and the eluted proteins were dialyzed against buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). The dialysate was loaded onto a Hitrap Q column (GE Healthcare), and the proteins were eluted in the flow-through fraction. The eluted proteins were subjected to chromatography on a Hitrap SP column (GE Healthcare). The proteins containing UDG activity were eluted at 0.25 m sodium chloride, pooled, and stored at 4 °C. The mutated PfuUDG proteins prepared in this study were purified by the same procedures. The purification of PfuPCNA and its mutants was performed as described previously (29Matsumiya S. Ishino S. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). P. furiosus Pol BI (PfuPolBI) was prepared as described previously (30Komori K. Ishino Y. Protin Eng. 2000; 13: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The purity of each protein used in this study was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. No extra band was detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the gel containing 2 μg of each purified protein. The protein concentrations were calculated by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The theoretical molecular absorption coefficient of each molecule was calculated based on its tryptophan and tyrosine content, as described (31Jarvis T.C. Paul L.S. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12709-12716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The calculated molar extinction coefficients of PfuUDG, PfuPCNA, and PfuPolBI are 24,410, 7450, and 129,040, respectively.Uracil DNA Glycosylase Assay—The 49-mer deoxynucleotide (5′-AGCTATGACCATGATTACGAATTGUTTAATTCGTGCAGGCATGGTAGCT-3′) labeled with 32P at the 5′ terminus was annealed to either the 49-mer deoxynucleotide, 5′-AGCTACCATGCCTGCACGAATTAAGCAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAGCT-3′, or 5′-AGCTACCATGCCTGCACGAATTAAACAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAGCT-3′ in TAM buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, and 0.5 mm magnesium acetate) to produce a double-stranded substrate with a G:U base pair or a A:U base pair at the center of the 49-mer. The purified PfuUDG proteins (at different concentrations for each experiment, as described in the figure legends) were incubated with 5 nm DNA substrate, prepared as described above, in 20 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 60 °C for 15 min. The reactions were then subjected to hot alkali treatment by the addition of 2 μl of 200 mm NaOH and an incubation for 10 min at 90 °C. After the treatment, the same volume of 200 mm HCl was added to neutralize the samples, and then a 6-μl aliquot of loading dye (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol) was added. Samples were heated at 98 °C for 5 min and chilled rapidly on ice prior to loading onto a denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and were scanned with a FLA5000 imager to detect the 32P-labeled DNA. Three independent experiments were carried out in succession for each condition required in this study, and the S.E. values are shown as vertical lines on the plots in each graph.Measurements of UV-visible Spectra—The purified wild-type PfuUDG, C17S, C20S, and C17/20S proteins were concentrated to 180 μm with Ultrafree-0.5 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore). The UV-visible absorption spectra of the proteins were measured with an Ultrospec 3100 Pro (GE Healthcare).Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—A Biacore system was used to study the physical interaction between PfuUDG and PfuPCNA. Highly purified recombinant PfuUDG or PfuPCNA was bound to a CM5 sensor chip (research grade; Biacore) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To measure the kinetic parameters, various concentrations of PfuUDG (0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 μm) were applied to the immobilized PCNA. The physical interaction between PfuUDG and PfuPolBI was evaluated in the same manner. All measurements were conducted at 25 °C, in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% Tween 20. At the end of each cycle, the bound protein was removed by washing with 2 m NaCl. The equilibrium constant (KD) for PfuUDG binding to PfuPCNA was determined from the association and dissociation curves of the sensorgrams, using the BIAevaluation program (Biacore).Model Building of PfuUDG·PfuPCNA·DNA—The molecular model was constructed from the crystal structures of T. thermophilus UDG (Protein Data Bank code 2ddg) and P. furiosus PCNA (Protein Data Bank code 1isq) by using two in-house programs, BIOMOL and SEARCHCMP, and MOE (Ryoka Systems Inc.). BIOMOL can calculate the biological quaternary structure from the asymmetric unit of a crystal structure (32Shirai T. Hung V.S. Morinaka K. Kobayashi T. Ito S. Proteins. 2008; (in press)Google Scholar). SEARCHCMP assembles two molecular structures by searching for and superposing the same or similar molecules in two Protein Data Bank files. The trimeric form of PfuPCNA was made with BIOMOL, and then the UDG·PCNA complex (complex-1) was assembled by superposing the corresponding new PCNA interaction site in TthUDG and the bound PIP-box peptide in the PfuPCNA trimer. The homology model of PfuUDG was constructed with MOE from TthUDG and was used to replace the TthUDG in the complex-1 model. The position of the dsDNA was based on that in the co-crystal structure of TthUDG-DNA, which was recently published (33Kosaka H. Hoseki Jun Nakagawa N. Kuramitsu S. Masui R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 839-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Since the bound dsDNA substrate co-crystallized with TthUDG was not long enough to penetrate PCNA, a B-type dsDNA model was also assembled into complex-1 to build the ternary complex (complex-2). Finally, the assembled model was energy-minimized with MOE to obtain the final model of the PfuUDG·PfuPCNA·DNA complex (complex-3).RESULTSBiochemical Properties of PfuUDG—Sequence homology searches revealed the presence of a family 4 UDG homolog in the P. furiosus genome. An amino acid sequence alignment between the P. furiosus UDG candidate and the T. thermophilus UDG reviewed that the active site motifs are well conserved between them (Fig. 1). Furthermore, four cysteine residues (Cys17, Cys20, Cys88, and Cys104), which would be important for the formation of the Fe-S cluster, are completely conserved between the two sequences (Fig. 1). Therefore, we cloned the gene (open reading frame PF1385), expressed it in E. coli cells, and purified the recombinant protein to investigate its biochemical properties. The purified protein had a brown color, suggesting the existence of an Fe-S cluster, as shown previously for other family 4 UDGs (7Hoseki J. Okamoto A. Masui R. Shibata T. Inoue Y. Yokoyama S. Kuramitsu S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 34Hinks J.A. Evans M.C. De Miguel Y. Sartori A.A. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16936-16940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The uracil excision activity of the protein was detected by using a synthetic oligonucleotide containing a uracil base at the center as the substrate, and we designated the gene product as PfuUDG, a member of the family 4 UDGs. As shown in Fig. 2A, PfuUDG can remove uracil from both single- and double-stranded DNAs. Like the other family 4 UDGs, divalent cations were not required for the activity. In addition, the maximum enzyme activity of PfuUDG was observed at 80 °C (data not shown).FIGURE 2Biochemical properties of PfuUDG. A, the substrate specificity of PfuUDG was examined by using a synthetic 49-mer oligonucleotide containing a uracil base at the center. Wild-type PfuUDG (20 fmol) was incubated with 100 fmol of the double-stranded DNA substrates containing G:C*, G:U*, and A:U* base pairs (the asterisk indicates the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide) in the reaction, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A single-stranded (ss) DNA was also tested in the same manner as the double-stranded DNA substrates. B, the colors of the purified wild-type (WT) and mutant (C17S, C20S, and C17S/C20S) PfuUDG protein solutions at a concentration of 180 μm are shown. C, the UV-visible absorption spectra (280-600 nm) of the PfuUDG proteins at a concentration of 180 μm are shown. D, comparison of the enzyme activities of the wild-type and mutant (C17S, C20S, and C17S/C20S) PfuUDGs. Various amounts of the PfuUDG proteins, as indicated, were incubated with 100 fmol of the uracil-containing DNA substrate (G:U*) in the reaction, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The uracil excision efficiency is plotted as a function of the enzyme concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test the importance of the cysteine residues for the formation of the Fe-S cluster, we constructed the serine-substituted mutants C17S, C20S, and C17S/C20S. All of the serine-substituted PfuUDGs were purified by the same procedure as used for the wild-type PfuUDG, and the yields of purified proteins (3 mg from 1 liter of culture) were not different from that of wild type PfuUDG. The purified C17S and C20S proteins had a brown color similar to that of the wild type protein, whereas the C17S/C20S mutant was purified as a colorless fraction (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, the UV-visible absorption spectra of the wild-type, C17S, and C20S protein had a broad shoulder at a wavelength of 400 nm, which is specific for Fe-S proteins (34Hinks J.A. Evans M.C. De Miguel Y. Sartori A.A. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16936-16940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, a decrease in the absorbance at 400 nm was observed in the spectrum of the C17S/C20S mutant (Fig. 2C). The colorless fractionation of the C17S/C20S protein indicates the loss of the Fe-S cluster by these substitutions. Due to color fading after the protein purification, the spectra of the colored proteins (wild-type, C17S, and C20S) were inconsistent. A similar observation about the fading was reported previously (9Klinge S. Hirst J. Maman J.D. Krude T. Pellegrini L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 875-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Since the amount of purified C17S/C20S mutant protein was the same as that of wild type from the same procedure, including the heat treatment (80 °C for 20 min), as that of the wild type protein, the apparent thermostability of the mutant protein must not be very different from that of the wild-type enzyme. In order to examine the role of the Fe-S cluster in the enzymatic reaction, the specific activities of the mutant proteins were compared. Decreased activity was observed for the C17S/C20S mutant protein, but the mutant enzyme still possesses substantial activity, indicating that the Fe-S cluster does not participate in the glycosylase activity directly (Fig. 2D).Physical Interaction between PfuUDG and PCNA—It was previously reported that two crenarchaeal family 4 UDGs (from P. aerophilum and S. solfataricus) physically interact with PCNA (23Yang H. Chiang J.H. Fitz-Gibbon S. Lebel M. Sartori A.A. Jiricny J. Slupska M.M. Miller J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22271-22278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Dionne I. Bell S.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the C-terminal PCNA-binding motifs found in these UDGs were not completely conserved in the archaeal UDGs. Especially, several euryarchaeal UDGs, including PfuUDG, have slightly shorter sequences as compared with the above crenarchaeal UDGs and lack the PCNA-binding motifs (23Yang H. Chiang J.H. Fitz-Gibbon S. Lebel M. Sartori A.A. Jiricny J. Slupska M.M. Miller J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22271-22278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We therefore performed SPR experiments to investigate the physical interaction between PfuUDG and PfuPCNA. Purified PfuPCNA was immobilized on the Biacore CM5 sensor chip, and wild-type PfuUDG was injected at different concentrations. A clear sensorgram indicating the physical interaction between PfuUDG and the immobilized PfuPCNA was obtained, as shown in Fig. 3. The calculated equilibrium constant (KD) for wild-type PfuUDG from the sensorgrams obtained with five different concentrations was 2.2 × 10-7 m, which was comparable with that for the P. furiosus DNA ligase (PfuLig)-PfuPCNA interaction (1.1 × 10-7 m) and the PfuPolB-PfuPCNA interaction (9.9 × 10-8 m) determined by our SPR analysis (35Kiyonari S. Takayama K. Nishida H. Ishino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28023-28032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Tori K. Kimizu M. Ishino S. Ishino Y. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5652-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that PfuUDG can interact with PfuPCNA via an unidentified binding motif.FIGURE 3Physical interaction between PfuUDG and PfuPCNA. The SPR analysis was performed using a Biacore system to detect the physical interaction between PfuUDG and PfuPCNA. Purified PfuPCNA was immobilized on a Biacore sensor chip, and various concentrations of purified PfuUDG (0.4-1.2 μm) were injected for 120 s.

https://openalex.org/W2089320434,"Prion protein-like protein/doppel is neurotoxic, causing ataxia and Purkinje cell degeneration in mice, whereas prion protein antagonizes doppel-induced neurodegeneration. Doppel is homologous to the C-terminal half of prion protein but lacks the amino acid sequences corresponding to the N-terminal half of prion protein. We show here that transgenic mice expressing a fusion protein consisting of the N-terminal half, corresponding to residues 1-124, of prion protein and doppel in neurons failed to develop any neurological signs for up to 730 days in a background devoid of prion protein. In addition, the fusion protein prolonged the onset of ataxia in mice expressing exogenous doppel. These results suggested that the N-terminal part of prion protein has a neuroprotective potential acting both cis and trans on doppel. We also show that prion protein lacking the pre-octapeptide repeat (Delta25-50) or octapeptide repeat (Delta51-90) region alone could not impair the antagonistic function against doppel."
https://openalex.org/W1994855870,"Most G-proteins require a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to regulate a variety of critical cellular processes. Interestingly, a small number of G-proteins switch between the active and inactive forms without a GEF. Translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) normally requires the GEF eEF1Bα to accelerate nucleotide dissociation. However, several mutant forms of eEF1A are functional independent of this essential regulator in vivo. GEF-independent eEF1A mutations localize close to the G-protein motifs that are crucial for nucleotide binding. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that reduced GDP affinity correlates with wild type growth and high translation activities of GEF-independent mutants. Furthermore, the mutant forms show an 11–22-fold increase in rates of GDP dissociation from eEF1A compared with the wild type protein. All mutant forms have dramatically enhanced stability at elevated temperatures. This, coupled with data demonstrating that eEF1A is also more stable in the presence of nucleotides, suggests that both the GEF and nucleotide have stabilizing effects on eEF1A.

GTPases regulate a variety of cellular functions with a conserved mechanism of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Signal transduction, control of cell cycle and differentiation during cell division, protein biosynthesis, vesicular trafficking, and translocation of membrane proteins are key cellular processes where GTPases play critical roles. Based on their functional roles, domain structures, or sizes, the superfamily of GTPases can be divided into many families, including small G proteins (Ras GTPase superfamily), heterotrimeric G proteins, and the translation factor family (1Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). All GTPases share a G-domain with conserved sequence elements, such as switch I and II, the P-loop (phosphate binding loop), and the NKXD element (2Dever T.E. Glynias M.J. Merrick W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1814-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Guanine nucleotides form specific interactions with these sites, which are modulated by G-protein accessory factors to create the switch mechanism between the active and inactive forms (1Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 3Sprang S.R. Coleman D.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). GTPase activation factors stimulate GTP hydrolysis, resulting in the inactive GDP-bound form. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 2The abbreviations used are:GEFguanine nucleotide exchange factoreEF1eEF1A, eEF1B, and eEF2, translation elongation factor 1, 1A, 1B, and 2, respectivelyeEFSecselenocysteine-specific elongation factoreRF3eukaryotic release factor 3eIF5Beukaryotic initiation factor 5BFRETfluorescence resonance energy transfermant2′-(or 3′)-O-N-methylanthraniloyl. catalyze GDP release by reducing the nucleotide affinity (1Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). This allows G-proteins to rebind GTP due to a higher cellular concentration of GTP and thus switch to their active form. The GEFs interact with the switch I and II regions while inserting residues close to or into the P-loop and Mg2+ binding site. The insertion of the GEF residues perturbs the interaction surface in the phosphate binding region, resulting in the release of phosphate groups, which in turn causes dissociation of the nucleotide. In contrast to the mechanism of exchange and the G-proteins themselves, GEFs show little to no conservation in sequence or structure (3Sprang S.R. Coleman D.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 155-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). guanine nucleotide exchange factor eEF1A, eEF1B, and eEF2, translation elongation factor 1, 1A, 1B, and 2, respectively selenocysteine-specific elongation factor eukaryotic release factor 3 eukaryotic initiation factor 5B fluorescence resonance energy transfer 2′-(or 3′)-O-N-methylanthraniloyl. The crystal structures of the majority of G-proteins solved in the presence of nucleotides show that the β-phosphate of the nucleotide interacts with the P-loop, and this interaction is considered to be the most important element for the tight binding of nucleotide (1Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Another important contributor to binding affinity and specificity is the NKXD element, which interacts with the nucleotide base (2Dever T.E. Glynias M.J. Merrick W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1814-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Until recently, the order of events that leads to nucleotide release and the region of the nucleotide released first were unclear. However, a sequence of interactions was proposed at least for some G-proteins. According to the model, upon binding of the GEF to the G-protein, the phosphate groups are released first, and then the base of the entering nucleotide binds to the NKXD motif and displaces the GEF (4Bos J.L. Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 2007; 129: 865-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Although most of the GTPases require a GEF, some G-proteins can function efficiently without an exchange factor. Typically, GEFs accelerate the nucleotide release from G-proteins, which is normally a slow process. A G-protein without a GEF probably allows nucleotide release rapid enough for cell survival. G-proteins could maintain rapid nucleotide release rates that lead to GEF independence in several ways. Lower affinity of GDP for the G-protein could allow a G-protein to function without a GEF. In addition, the G-protein may not require the separate level of regulation of activity typically performed by the GEF. The eukaryotic proteins translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2), release factor 3 (eRF3), initiation factor 5B (eIF5B), selenocysteine-specific elongation factor (eEFSec) and the eEF1A-like GTPases Hbs1p and Guf1p apparently function independently of a GEF. This is mostly explained by reduced GDP affinity or higher dissociation rate constants for GDP release from the G-protein in the absence of GEF. For example, the rate constants for GDP dissociation from both eIF5B and SelB (bacterial EFSec) are higher than other translation factors (5Pisareva V.P. Hellen C.U. Pestova T.V. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2622-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 6Thanbichler M. Bock A. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20458-20466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and eEFSec has lower affinity for GDP (7Tujebajeva R.M. Copeland P.R. Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Harney J.W.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This, coupled with the higher level of GTP over GDP in the cell, allows spontaneous regeneration of the active form of the protein (6Thanbichler M. Bock A. Goody R.S. J. Biol.

Ehrenberg M. J. Biol. (Bronx N. Y.). 2005; 4: 9Google Scholar). The variety for the GEF requirement and the sequence and structural diversity of GEFs implies that GEF proteins might have gained different functions, which may be specific to the GTPase·GEF complex, cell type or the organism. One of the G-proteins in the translation family is eukaryotic translation elongation factor (eEF1A). It binds and recruits aminoacyl-tRNAs to the A-site of the ribosome. eEF1A is part of the eEF1 complex, including the eEF1B subunits. eEF1B is composed of the α and γ subunits in fungi, and a third β subunit is present in metazoans. The eEF1Bα subunit performs the catalytic GEF function for eEF1A. The γ subunit is probably a regulatory subunit, since the eEF1Bαγ complex has a proposed role in the oxidative stress response pathway (11Olarewaju O. Ortiz P.A. Chowdhury W. Chatterjee I. Kinzy T.G. RNA Biol. 2004; 1: 12-17Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae eEF1A with the catalytic C terminus of eEF1Bα shows that one face of eEF1Bα interacts with domain I, whereas the other interacts with domain II (12Andersen G.R. Pedersen L. Valente L. Chatterjee I. Kinzy T.G. Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1261-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Domain I contains the nucleotide and Mg2+ binding site, whereas domain II is the proposed aminoacyl-tRNA binding site of eEF1A. In addition to its established role as a GEF for eEF1A and accelerating the rate of GDP dissociation by 700-fold (13Pittman Y. Valente L. Jeppesen G.R. Andersen G.R. Patel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19457-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), eEF1Bα also affects translational fidelity (14Carr-Schmid A. Valente L. Loik V.I. Williams T. Starita L.M. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5257-5266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structures of bacterial and eukaryotic EF-Tu/eEF1As, mammalian eEF1A has evolved from bacterial EF-Tu by the insertion of about 70 amino acids into the loop regions between the domains (9Merrick W.C. Nyborg J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 89-126Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae eEF1A has 81% identity and 89% similarity to human eEF1A (15Schirmaier F. Phillipson P. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3311-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Anand M. Valente L. Carr-Schmid A. Munshi R. Olarewaju O. Ortiz P. Kinzy T.G. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2001; 66: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These results suggest that although the structure and the function of eEF1A are well conserved, the GEF for eEF1A has gained more complexity and perhaps more functions throughout evolution. In S. cerevisiae, the TEF5 gene encoding eEF1Bα is essential in vivo (17Hiraga K. Suzuki K. Tsuchiya E. Miyakawa T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the requirement for the TEF5 gene can be suppressed by the presence of excess substrate, eEF1A. Such an eEF1Bα-deficient strain, however, shows defects in growth and translation (18Kinzy T.G. Woolford Jr., J.L. Genetics. 1995; 141: 481-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two independent, unbiased genetic screens performed to isolate suppressors of the eEF1Bα requirement in vivo yielded only eEF1A mutations. The mutant forms of eEF1A that function as suppressors of the eEF1Bα deficiency allow growth similar to a wild type eEF1A strain. In order to analyze the effect of suppressor mutations independent of any other eEF1 components, strains lacking eEF1Bα and both chromosomal eEF1A genes and thus expressing only the mutant form of eEF1A were prepared. Surprisingly, these strains show no growth defects and little to no reduction in total translation (19Ozturk S.B. Vishnu M.R. Olarewaju O. Starita L.M. Masison D.C. Kinzy T.G. Genetics. 2006; 174: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all mutations map to the nucleotide-binding domain of eEF1A. Each mutation is in very close proximity to at least one of the conserved sequence elements of the G-protein, which suggests that nucleotide affinity to eEF1A might be affected, creating an open conformation to allow accelerated GDP release without eEF1Bα. In order to determine the mechanism of the bypass suppression of an essential GEF, we analyzed the effect of mutant forms of eEF1A on nucleotide binding by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from hydrophobic residues of eEF1A to fluoresecently 2′-(or 3′)-O-N-methylanthraniloyl (mant)-labeled nucleotides. The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for mant-GDP binding to eEF1A mutant forms increased up to 37-fold compared with that of wild type eEF1A, indicating reduced GDP affinity. Using stopped-flow kinetics, the mutant forms of eEF1A displayed increased GDP dissociation rates up to 22-fold compared with the wild type protein. However, the Kd values for mant-GMPPNP, a nonhydrolyzable homolog of GTP, were essentially unchanged, indicating that the selective pressure reduces GDP but not GTP binding. Although the mutations do not cause a fundamental change in the native state of the protein as observed by CD spectroscopy, the mutant forms showed dramatically increased stability. Enhanced stability was also observed when eEF1A was bound to guanine nucleotides. Thus, this study demonstrates that the GEF eEF1Bα as well as the distribution of the nucleotide-bound state of eEF1A within the cell probably contribute to stabilizing the protein. The consequences of these eEF1A mutations on the specificity of effects on GDP versus GTP binding raises the questions of evolutionary development of GEF function and independence as well as G-protein complexity. Yeast Techniques and Mutant Preparation—S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Escherichia coli DH5α was used for plasmid preparation. Standard yeast genetic methods were employed (20Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in YEPD (1% Bacto yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) as the carbon source (21Ausubel F.M.

The R164K, T22S, A112T, and A117V eEF1A mutants were prepared in pTKB754 (TEF1 URA3) by PCR mutagenesis using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). The resulting plasmids were transformed into MC213 (TEF2 TRP1), loss of wild-type eEF1A plasmid was monitored by growth on 5-fluoroanthranilic acid (22Toyn J.H. Gunyuzlu P.L. White W.H. Thompson L.A.

The eluted and dialyzed material from the protein solution was applied to CM-52 cation exchanger, pre-equilibrated with buffer 1 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotonin). The CM-52 column was washed with buffer 1 with 50 mm KCl and eluted using a 50–300 mm KCl salt gradient of buffer 1. eEF1A-containing fractions were dialyzed overnight against 10 volumes of buffer 1 with 100 mm KCl and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Protein fractions used for assays were >95% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE. Mant-labeled Guanine Nucleotide Binding Assay—Mant-GMPPNP and mant-GDP were both purchased from Molecular Probes and purified with a 1-ml Hi-Trap DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) using an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Nucleotide-containing fractions were combined, lyophilized using a speed vacuum, resuspended in 100 μl of distilled H2O, and stored at -20 °C (13Pittman Y. Valente L. Jeppesen G.R. Andersen G.R. Patel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19457-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The binding affinity for mant-GDP or mant-GMMPNP to wild type or the mutant forms of eEF1A was measured by a fluorimetric titration assay using a FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorimeter (Horiba Jobin Yvon Inc.). All assays were performed at 25 °C. Wild type or mutant forms of eEF1A (1 μm) in 2.5 ml of binding buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) were placed in a 10 × 10 × 40-mm quartz cuvette with a magnetic stirring bar. Increasing concentrations of mant-nucleotide were added with continuous stirring for 3 min. Fluorescence changes of the mant-nucleotides (Fobs) were monitored upon indirect excitation via FRET. FRET excited tryptophans or tyrosines of eEF1A at a wavelength of 280 nm, and the emission wavelength of 440 nm was for the mant moiety of the nucleotides. The slit widths were 1.05 nm for both wavelengths. The protein and nucleotide complex-dependent fluorescence values (Fem) were obtained by correcting for titration volume and inner filter effect using the equation Fem = Fobs × (Vf/Vo) × 10(0.5(Abex(280) + Abem(440))), plotted against mant-GMPPNP or mant-GDP concentrations, and fit to the equations Fem = C + fEbEb + fMMt and Eb = (Kd + Mt + Et - (((Kd + Mt + Et)2 - 4MtEt0.5)))/2, where Vf is the final volume, Vo is the initial volume, Abex(280) is the excitation absorbance of mant-nucleotide, and Abem(440) is the emission absorbance of mant-nucleotide, C is background fluorescence, fM is the fluorescence coefficient of free mant-nucleotide, fEb is the fluorescence coefficient of mant-nucleotide bound to eEF1A, Et is the total eEF1A protein concentration, Mt is the total concentration of mant-nucleotide, the concentration of eEF1A bound to mant-nucleotide is Eb, and Kd is the mant-GMPPNP or mant-GDP dissociation constant.

CD Measurements—CD measurements were made using a circular dichroism spectrometer (model 400; Aviv Biomedical Inc.). The protein concentrations of the purified fractions were determined from the measurement of their different spectra in 6 m guanidine HCl between pH 12.5 and pH 6.0. The molar concentration (MC) of protein in the cuvette was calculated using the formula MC = A/(2.357Y + 830W), where A is the absorbance at 294 nm, Y is the number of tyrosines, and W is the number of tryptophans. The stock solutions were diluted to 0.2–0.4 mg/ml in purification buffer 1 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotonin) to a total volume of 300 μl in cells with a 0.1-cm path wavelength. The wavelength was set to 200–260 nm with 0.5-nm intervals. The wavelength measurements were carried out at 25 °C. After the temperature scan at 222 nm to obtain the melting curve, the wavelength scan was measured at 70 °C and 25 °C again after the samples were cooled down to test the refolding properties of the proteins. The CD spectra were analyzed using neural network analysis programs to determine α-helical, antiparallel, and parallel β-structure, turns, and the remainder content of the proteins (24Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 25Unneberg P. Merelo J.J. Chacon P. Moran F. Proteins. 2001; 42: 460-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The Aviv Macro Editor program was used to collect the wavelength spectra as a function of temperature. The cells were equilibrated for 2 min at 5 °C integrals, and the spectra were accumulated three times at a given temperature. The convex constraint algorithm was used to deconvolute the spectra to obtain the minimum number of basis spectra needed to fit the data (26Perczel A. Hollosi M. Tusnady G. Fasman G.D.

All CD data were reported in degrees cm2 dmol-1 ([θ]). Interactions of Guanine Nucleotides with eEF1A Are Well Represented by the Change in Mant-nucleotide Fluorescence—In order to determine the base-line guanine nucleotide binding characteristics of eEF1A, FRET from tryptophans and tyrosines of eEF1A to the mant fluorophore of GDP or GMPPNP was determined. Enhanced mant-nucleotide fluorescence with eEF1A (Figs. 1B and 2B) compared with mant-nucleotides alone (Figs. 1A and 2A) is the indication of FRET between eEF1A and the mant-nucleotides. In order to determine guanine nucleotide binding affinity of eEF1A, Kd values of eEF1A for mant-GDP and mant-GMPPNP were determined by a fluorimetric titration assay. The Kd for mant-GDP binding to eEF1A was determined as 0.095 μm (Fig. 1B). This value is in agreement with a Kd of 1 μm for unlabeled GDP and eEF1A (28Saha S.K. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12599-12603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and our previously published Kd of 0.18 μm for mant-GDP binding to eEF1A determined by stopped-flow kinetics (13Pittman Y. Valente L. Jeppesen G.R. Andersen G.R. Patel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19457-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine GTP binding affinity of eEF1A, the mant-labeled nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, mant-GMPPNP, was used. The previously published Kd of the eEF1A·GTP complex is 0.7 μm (28Saha S.K. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12599-12603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Kd for mant-GMPPNP binding to eEF1A was measured as 0.52 μm (Fig. 2B), indicating that mant-GMPPNP binding to eEF1A is a good representation of unmodified GTP binding to eEF1A.FIGURE 2GEF-independent mutants of eEF1A do not affect GMPPNP binding. The Kd values for the wild type and mutant forms of eEF1A and mant-GMPPNP were measured. Aliquots of mant-GMPPNP were added to binding buffer without (A) or with 1 μm of wild type (B) or mutant forms (C–E) of eEF1A. The fluorescence was measured and plotted as in Fig. 1. The Kd values are measured as 0.47 (T22S) (C), 0.41 (R164K) (D), 1.01 (A112T) (E), and 1.09 μm (A117V) (F). Residuals for the fits are shown in the lower panels to detect the experimental error for the fitted data sets.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutations of eEF1A That Suppress the Requirement for eEF1Bα Reduce GDP Affinity up to 37-fold—All of the mutations that allow eEF1A to function without its guanine nucleotide exchange factor eEF1Bα cluster in the GTP-binding domain (19Ozturk S.B. Vishnu M.R. Olarewaju O. Starita L.M. Masison D.C. Kinzy T.G. Genetics. 2006; 174: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In order to determine if these mutations affect nucleotide affinity in the absence of the exchange factor, we analyzed the GDP binding to the mutant forms of eEF1A by the mant-GDP fluorescence assay. Upon binding of the nucleotide to the eEF1A mutants, an increase in fluorescence was observed, and the data were fitted to determine Kd values for each mutant. The values obtained were 3.54 (T22S), 2.66 (R164K), 1.80 (A112T), and 1.18 μm (A117V) (Fig. 1, C–F, and Table 2), which represent a 12–37-fold increase in Kd as compared with wild type eEF1A (0.095 μm; Fig. 1B). Thus, one reason for the suppression of the requirement for the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eEF1Bα, is the reduced affinity of the mutant forms to GDP compared with the wild type eEF1A.TABLE 2Kd values for mGDP and GTP, koff for mGDPKd for mGDPKd for mGMPPNPkoff for mGDPμmμms–1Wild type0.095 ± 0.010.52 ± 0.020.17T22S3.54 ± 0.540.47 ± 0.191.88R164K2.66 ± 00.41 ± 0.402.54A112T1.80 ± 0.091.01 ± 0.311.96A117V1.18 ± 0.291.09 ± 0.093.89 Open table in a new tab GEF-independent Mutations of eEF1A Do Not Affect GTP Binding—eEF1Bα catalyzes the release of GDP to allow the inactive (GDP-bound) form of eEF1A to recycle back to its active (GTP-bound) form. In order to determine whether these eEF1A mutations reduce binding of both GDP and GTP or specifically GDP affinity, the Kd of the eEF1A mutant proteins for mant-GMPPNP were obtained. The change in fluorescence values was plotted against the increasing concentration of mant-GMPPNP and fitted to the equations to give Kd values of 1.01 (A112T), 1.09 (A117V), 0.47 (T22S), and 0.41 μm (R164K) (Fig. 2, C–F, and Table 2). The fact that the Kd values of the mutant forms are very similar to the Kd value of wild type eEF1A (0.52 μm; Fig. 2B) indicates that genetic selection during the isolation of the suppressors for the requirement of eEF1Bα targets GDP but not GTP affinity. GEF-independent Mutants of eEF1A Dissociate GDP at a Higher Rate—To determine if the mutations cause rapid spontaneous GDP dissociation from eEF1A in the absence of its GEF, we measured the dissociation rate constant of the mant-GDP·eEF1A complex using stopped-flow kinetics. Mutant forms of eEF1A were prebound to mant-GDP and then rapidly mixed with an excess of nonfluorescent GDP. The rate of mantnucleotide release was obtained by monitoring the decrease in fluorescence over time. The fluorescent intensity decayed exponentially on the order of seconds. The time course of mant-GDP displacement from the binary complex of each mutant by excess GDP was fitted by a single-exponential term, yielding dissociation rate constants (koff) of 3.89 (A117V), 2.54 (R164K), 1.96 (A112T), and 1.88 s-1 (T22S) (Fig. 3, A–D, and Table 2). The average dissociation rate constant of wild type eEF1A is 0.17 s-1 (13Pittman Y. Valente L. Jeppesen G.R. Andersen G.R. Patel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19457-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These data show that the nucleotide dissociation rate constants were stimulated 11–22-fold in the GEF-independent forms of eEF1A. These results support the contributions of higher GDP release rates in addition to reduced nucleotide affin"

https://openalex.org/W2171704279,"Here we identify a novel protein, named Parcs for pro-apoptotic protein required for cell survival, that is involved in both cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Parcs interacted with Apaf-1 by binding to the oligomerization domain of Apaf-1. Apaf-1-mediated activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 was markedly decreased in a cytosolic fraction isolated from HeLa cells with reduced parcs expression. Interestingly, parcs deficiency blocked cell proliferation in non-tumorigenic cells but not in multiple tumor cell lines. In MCF-10A cells, parcs deficiency led to early G1 arrest. Conditional inactivation of parcs in genetically modified primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts using the Cre-LoxP system also resulted in the inhibition of cell proliferation. We conclude that Parcs may define a molecular checkpoint in the control of cell proliferation for normal cells that is lost in tumor cells."

We previously reported reduced Pbx2 expression and defective thymocyte maturation in Prep1 hypomorphic mice. To further investigate the role of this homeodomain DNA-binding protein in T cell development, we generated transgenic mice expressing the N-terminal fragment of Pbx1 (Pbx1NT) under the control of the Lck proximal promoter. Principal Findings Pbx1NT causes Prep1 cytosolic sequestration, abolishes Prep1-dependent DNA-binding activity and results in reduced Pbx2 expression in developing thymocytes. Transgenic thymi reveal increased numbers of CD4− CD8− CD44− (DN3 and DN4) thymocytes, due to a higher frequency of DN2 and DN4 Pbx1NT thymocytes in the S phase. Transgenic thymocytes however do not accumulate at later stages, as revealed by a normal representation of CD4/CD8 double positive and single positive thymocytes, due to a higher rate of apoptotic cell death of DN4 Pbx1NT thymocytes. Conclusion The results obtained by genetic (Prep1 hypomorphic) and functional (Pbx1NT transgenic) inactivation of Prep1 support nonredundant roles for this homeodomain protein during different stages of T cell development."

https://openalex.org/W2145121144,"Sequencing by hybridisation is an effective method for obtaining large amounts of DNA sequence information at low cost. The efficiency of SBH depends on the design of the probe library to provide the maximum information for minimum cost. Long probes provide a higher probability of non-repeated sequences but lead to an increase in the number of probes required whereas short probes may not provide unique sequence information due to repeated sequences. We have investigated the effect of probe length, use of reference sequences, and thermal filtering on the design of probe libraries for several highly variable target DNA sequences.We designed overlapping probe libraries for a range of highly variable drug target genes based on known sequence information and develop a formal terminology to describe probe library design. We find that for some targets these libraries can provide good coverage of a previously unseen target whereas for others the coverage is less than 30%. The optimal probe length varies from as short at 12 nt to as large as 19 nt and depends on the sequence, its variability, and the stringency of thermal filtering. It cannot be determined from inspection of an example gene sequence.Optimal probe length and the optimal number of reference sequences used to design a probe library are highly target specific for highly variable sequencing targets. The optimum design cannot be determined simply by inspection of input sequences or of alignments but only by detailed analysis of the each specific target. For highly variable sequences, shorter probes can in some cases provide better information than longer probes. Probe library design would benefit from a general purpose tool for analysing these issues. The formal terminology developed here and the analysis approaches it is used to describe will contribute to the development of such tools."
